<p>However, the crude extract of 
 <italic>Barringtonia asiatica</italic> leaf from dichloromethane has indicated a significant antibacterial effect. During the past decades, it is known that Gram-negative bacteria are more resistant toward antimicrobial agents than Gram-positive bacteria, due to the presence of multilayered structure of Gram-negative bacteria, which is not present in Gram-positive bacteria [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In this study, our results showed that the extracts of the plant 
 <italic>Barringtonia asiatica</italic> from dichloromethane inhibited the growth of four bacteria with increase in concentration, from 25 ppm to 1000 ppm. With the highest inhibition rate obtained at 1000 ppm, the inhibition growth rate for 
 <italic>Salmonella typhi</italic> at 25 ppm was 2.50 ± 0.10 mm, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> was 3.07 ± 0.06 mm, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> was 3.25 ± 0.07 mm, and 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> was 3.00 ± 0.10 mm. The highest inhibition was observed at 1000 ppm with 3.87 ± 0.06 for 
 <italic>Salmonella typhi</italic>, 4.30 ± 0.20 for 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 4.90 ± 0.10 for 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, and the highest of all the inhibition among the pathogen was obtained from 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumonia</italic> with 5.00 ± 0.06, significantly when compared to the test control tetracycline with inhibition rate 5.68 ± 0.59 mm. Thus, it was observed that the crude extract is active against Gram-negative as well as Gram-positive bacteria.
