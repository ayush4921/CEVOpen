<p>In this study, the effect of dichloromethane leaf extracts of 
 <italic>Barringtonia asiatic</italic>a against the DPPH radical scavenging was evaluated as shown in 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The extract showed an appreciable DPPH scavenging activity compared to the test control. The scavenge 50% of the radical (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) values of 
 <italic>Barringtonia asiatica</italic> and that of vitamin C were exhibited to be 13.34 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL and 10.66
