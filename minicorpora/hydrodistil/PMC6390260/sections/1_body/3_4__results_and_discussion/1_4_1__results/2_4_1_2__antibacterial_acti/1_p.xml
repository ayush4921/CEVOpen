 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the result of the antibacterial activity of the 
 <italic>Barringtonia asiatica</italic> leaf extract tested against four bacterial strains that cause menace to infected patients. The MIC results show that the dichloromethane extract of the plants had a broad-spectrum activity and was able to inhibit the growth of the tested bacteria strains between the ranges of 2.50 ± 0.10–5.00 ± 0.06 mm. The extracts of 
 <italic>Barringtonia asiatica</italic> displayed a strong antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>Salmonella typhi, Escherichia coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumonia</italic>, having inhibition rate values of 3.87 ± 0.06 mm, 4.30 ± 0.20 mm, 4.90 ± 0.10 mm, and 5.00 ± 0.06 mm at 1000 ppm, respectively. It was also observed that the plant extracts exhibited effective antibacterial activity against all pathogens with increase in concentration of the crude extracts. The 
 <italic>Barringtonia asiatica</italic> leaf extract was found to be more active in 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumonia</italic> in all concentration ranges throughout the test. Thus, results indicated significant antibacterial activity against all microorganisms. However, none of the extracts concentration of the plants showed more potency than that of the standard drugs (tetracycline) with the rate of inhibition of 5.68 ± 0.59 mm.
