 <italic>Barringtonia asiatica</italic> is a species of 
 <italic>Barringtonia</italic>, native to mangrove habitats on the tropical area; it is a common plant in the Malaysian mangroves and wetlands such as the Kuching wetlands in Sarawak, Bako National Park, and Meranek river in Kota Samarahan. It is also found in tropical Africa, Nigeria, and Madagascar. The plant has large pinkish-white pompon flowers which give off a sickly sweet smell to attract bats and moths which pollinate the flowers at night; it is also known as box fruit plant due to the distinct box shape of the fruit. The plant is a medium-sized tree growing to 7–25 m tall [

 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] to possess antimicrobial properties. Thus, this study evaluated the phytochemical composition of the essential oils from hydrodistillation and antibacterial and antioxidant properties of the crude extract of the leaves. However, with exception of the crude extract, the extraction and phytochemical screening of essential oils from the leaves to the best of our knowledge have not been studied until now.
