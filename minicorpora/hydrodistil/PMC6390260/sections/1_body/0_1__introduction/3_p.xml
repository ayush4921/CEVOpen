<p>We also know that bacterial infection is a major cause of death rate mortality particularly in developing countries. A good number of synthetic and semisynthetic pathogenic agents are available today. However, resistance to this microorganism is rapidly growing [

 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. One of the major concerns is also drug hypersensitivity and immune-suppression [

 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Because of these negative effects, and the constant development of bacterial resistance, there is a great concern and continuous need to develop newer antibacterial agents to avert this menace with less harm side effect to the patient. Due to these reasons, medicinal plants are needed for this control [
