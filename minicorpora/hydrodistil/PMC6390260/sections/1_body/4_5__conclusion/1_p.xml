<p>The result from the present study showed that 
 <italic>Barringtonia asiatica</italic> collected from Meranek river in Samarahan Sarawak constitutes of chemical components that reflect the biological activities of the extracts. The plant exhibited maximum antibacterial potential. Thus, the positive potential effect seen in the microorganism could be as a result of the composition of the phytochemicals from the dichloromethane crude extract as well. These compounds have the most important applications against human pathogens. The results of tests from various concentrations and the presence of antioxidant component of the leaf extract suggest that the leaves have some significant inhibitory action against pathogens. It was also reported in this study that the essential oil and its phytochemical screening is a novel method since no research has been carried out on it, and as such, deep studies about the extraction techniques and analysis of the essential oil of Sarawak 
 <italic>Barringtonia</italic> species and antibacterial potential are needed for its full understanding as it could be of great importance to pharmaceutical, food, and cosmetics industries.
