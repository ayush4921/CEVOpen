0: Inoculation of the bacteria was carried out in a biohazard cabinet, and the procedure was based on the method described by Ram Kumar and Pranay [ 25].
1: Approximately, 1 mL of the ready bacterial broth was transferred into minicentrifuge tubes.
2: A sterile cotton swap was dipped into the minicentrifuge tube containing bacteria broth and streaked over entire of the agar plate surface, performed in 4 different directions.
3: The agar plate was then left for 510 minutes before applying the test samples.
4: The disc used was 6 mm diameter.
5: A volume of 10  L of the test samples of concentrations 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, and 1000  g/mL were each pupated onto the discs and placed onto the agar plate by using sterile forceps and gently pressed to ensure contact.
6: Next to be placed on the agar plate was the disc pupated with methanol as negative control, followed by 30  g of tetracycline as the standard antibacterial agent (positive control).
7: The plates were left at room temperature for 10 minutes to allow the diffusion of the test samples and the standards into the agar.
8: Each crude extract was tested in triplicate for the bacterium used.
9: The plate samples were then incubated at 37C for 24 hours before the inhibition zone around every sample disc being examined.
10: The inhibition zone was measured in diameter (mm) to indicate the presence of antibacterial activity for each sample compared to the positive control.
