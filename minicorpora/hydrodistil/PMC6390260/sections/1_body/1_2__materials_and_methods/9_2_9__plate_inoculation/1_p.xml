<p>Inoculation of the bacteria was carried out in a biohazard cabinet, and the procedure was based on the method described by Ram Kumar and Pranay [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Approximately, 1 mL of the ready bacterial broth was transferred into minicentrifuge tubes. A sterile cotton swap was dipped into the minicentrifuge tube containing bacteria broth and streaked over entire of the agar plate surface, performed in 4 different directions. The agar plate was then left for 5–10 minutes before applying the test samples. The disc used was 6 mm diameter. A volume of 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of the test samples of concentrations 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, and 1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL were each pupated onto the discs and placed onto the agar plate by using sterile forceps and gently pressed to ensure contact. Next to be placed on the agar plate was the disc pupated with methanol as negative control, followed by 30 
 <italic>μ</italic>g of tetracycline as the standard antibacterial agent (positive control). The plates were left at room temperature for 10 minutes to allow the diffusion of the test samples and the standards into the agar. Each crude extract was tested in triplicate for the bacterium used. The plate samples were then incubated at 37°C for 24 hours before the inhibition zone around every sample disc being examined. The inhibition zone was measured in diameter (mm) to indicate the presence of antibacterial activity for each sample compared to the positive control.
