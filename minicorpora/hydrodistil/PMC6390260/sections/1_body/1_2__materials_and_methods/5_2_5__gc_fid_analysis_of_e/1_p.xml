<p>The sample of the essential oils was characterized by chromatography methods. The essential oils were first analysed on a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) as reported by Costa et al. [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. GC-FID of the oil sample was performed on a PerkinElmer gas chromatography model Clarus 680 equipped with a HP-5 fused capillary column (5% phenylmethylpolysiloxane stationary phase) with 30 m length, 0.25 
 <italic>μ</italic>m of film thickness, and 0.25 mm internal diameter. The temperature for the injector and detector was programmed at 260°C and 280°C, respectively. The GC oven temperature was programmed from 60°C for 4 hours and 42 minutes, after which it was increased at the rate of 5°C per minute to 300°C and held at the final temperature for 5 minutes. Prior to injection, 1.0 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of the essential oil sample was diluted with 199 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of dichloromethane. The prepared oil sample of exactly 1 
 <italic>μ</italic>L was injected using a microsyringe into the GC column. Helium gas was used as carrier gas with a flow rate of 1 mL/minute for this reading.
