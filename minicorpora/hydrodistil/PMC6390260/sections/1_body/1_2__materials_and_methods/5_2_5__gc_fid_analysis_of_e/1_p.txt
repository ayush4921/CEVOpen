0: The sample of the essential oils was characterized by chromatography methods.
1: The essential oils were first analysed on a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) as reported by Costa et al.
2: [ 18].
3: GC-FID of the oil sample was performed on a PerkinElmer gas chromatography model Clarus 680 equipped with a HP-5 fused capillary column (5% phenylmethylpolysiloxane stationary phase) with 30 m length, 0.25  m of film thickness, and 0.25 mm internal diameter.
4: The temperature for the injector and detector was programmed at 260C and 280C, respectively.
5: The GC oven temperature was programmed from 60C for 4 hours and 42 minutes, after which it was increased at the rate of 5C per minute to 300C and held at the final temperature for 5 minutes.
6: Prior to injection, 1.0  L of the essential oil sample was diluted with 199  L of dichloromethane.
7: The prepared oil sample of exactly 1  L was injected using a microsyringe into the GC column.
8: Helium gas was used as carrier gas with a flow rate of 1 mL/minute for this reading.
