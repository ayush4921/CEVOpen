0: The chemical constituents of the oil sample were identified based on their Kovat's indices (KI), by comparing their mass spectra and those of the standard.
1: The standard used was  n-alkanes which consist of C9 to C33 [ 19].
2: Kovat's indices were calculated using the following equation, and the compound was identified using Flavornet ( http://www.flavornet.com): (2)Kovat's  indices=100tRitRnLRn+1tRn+n.
