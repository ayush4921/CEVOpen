<p>The fresh plant-part samples of the leaves of 
 <italic>Barringtonia asiatica</italic> were subjected to water distillation for 8 hours using the Clevenger apparatus to extract the oils quantitatively, according to the method described by Jusoh et al. [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and Fasihuddin and Ibrahim [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Approximately 100 g of freshly cut and grounded samples of 
 <italic>Barringtonia asiatica</italic> leaves was weighed, transferred into a 2-litre round flask, and then mixed with 1.35 litres of distilled water. The flask was assembled to the Clevenger trap, which was connected to the condenser, and then heated. Heat was applied to the sample for 8 hours using hydrodistillation process. After 8 hours, the collected oil in the Clevenger was allowed to cool at 28°C room temperature. The water which is at the bottom of the oil was first drained to separate from the oil. The oily sample was treated with anhydrous sodium sulphate (Na
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>) to remove the remaining trace water [

The essential oil which was obtained was kept in a vial and then stored in a refrigerator at 4°C prior to further analysis. The percentage yield of the oil was as reported by Costa et al. [
