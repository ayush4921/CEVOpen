0: The fresh plant-part samples of the leaves of  Barringtonia asiatica were subjected to water distillation for 8 hours using the Clevenger apparatus to extract the oils quantitatively, according to the method described by Jusoh et al.
1: [ 15] and Fasihuddin and Ibrahim [ 16].
2: Approximately 100 g of freshly cut and grounded samples of  Barringtonia asiatica leaves was weighed, transferred into a 2-litre round flask, and then mixed with 1.35 litres of distilled water.
3: The flask was assembled to the Clevenger trap, which was connected to the condenser, and then heated.
4: Heat was applied to the sample for 8 hours using hydrodistillation process.
5: After 8 hours, the collected oil in the Clevenger was allowed to cool at 28C room temperature.
6: The water which is at the bottom of the oil was first drained to separate from the oil.
7: The oily sample was treated with anhydrous sodium sulphate (Na 2SO 4) to remove the remaining trace water [ 17].
8: The experiment was performed in triplicates for each sample, and the yield was averaged over triplicates.
9: The essential oil which was obtained was kept in a vial and then stored in a refrigerator at 4C prior to further analysis.
10: The percentage yield of the oil was as reported by Costa et al.
11: [ 18] using the following formula: (1)percentage  yield=weight  of  the  extracted  oilgdry  weight  of the  sampleg100.
