<p>The free-radical scavenging assay of compound 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) was used to evaluate the antioxidant properties of the crude extract. The measurement was based on the method described in [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The sample was prepared by diluting 6 mg of crude extract into 6 mL of methanol, producing a concentration of 1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL. The stock solution was sonicated to ensure the homogeneity of the sample. Five other concentrations were prepared at 10, 50, 100, 500, and 1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, diluted from the 1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL stock solution. Sample of 5000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL was prepared separately by diluting 25 mg of crude extract into 5 mL of methanol. Approximately, 3 mL of 0.1 mM solution of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) in methanol was each added into six series of prepared concentrations (10, 50, 100, 500, 1000, and 5000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) of sample solutions (1 mL). Analysis was done in triplicate. The solution was mixed vigorously and left to stand at room temperature for 30 minutes in the dark after which its absorbance was measured spectrophotometrically at 517 nm using Jasco ultraviolet spectrophotometer model V-630. Methanol was used as blank (only methanol) and negative control (1 mL methanol mixed with 3 mL DPPH), while ascorbic acid (vitamin C) was used as the standard. The concentration of the sample required to inhibit 50% of the DPPH free radical was calculated as IC
 <sub>50</sub>, and the value was determined using the log dose inhibition curve which was performed by using PRISM version 3.02 software, based on the calculated values of the DPPH scavenging activity (%) of the sample [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. DPPH scavenging activity (%) was calculated with formula 
 <italic>A</italic>0-
 <italic>A</italic>1/
 <italic>A</italic>0 × 100, where 
 <italic>A</italic>0 was the absorbance of the control, while 
 <italic>A</italic>1 was the absorbance in presence of the sample.
