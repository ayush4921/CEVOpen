<p>Fresh leaves of the plant 
 <italic>Barringtonia asiatica</italic> were washed with distilled water to remove the soil and dust particles; they were thoroughly air-dried and powdered using a laboratory grinder machine (FGR-350, Quest Scientific). For extraction using dichloromethane (CH
 <sub>2</sub>CL
 <sub>2</sub>), 150â€‰g of the powdered samples was placed into an Erlenmeyer flask and dichloromethane (CH
 <sub>2</sub>CL
 <sub>2</sub>), three times the weight of the extracts, was added; the solution was covered and shaken at an interval of an hour and then allowed to stand at room temperature for 7 days. Both extracts were combined and concentrated with a rotary evaporator (Heidolph Laborota 4000 efficient) under reduced pressure to obtain dichloromethane extracts.
