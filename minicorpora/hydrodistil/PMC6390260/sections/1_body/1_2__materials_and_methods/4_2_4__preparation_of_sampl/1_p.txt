0: Fresh leaves of the plant  Barringtonia asiatica were washed with distilled water to remove the soil and dust particles; they were thoroughly air-dried and powdered using a laboratory grinder machine (FGR-350, Quest Scientific).
1: For extraction using dichloromethane (CH 2CL 2), 150 g of the powdered samples was placed into an Erlenmeyer flask and dichloromethane (CH 2CL 2), three times the weight of the extracts, was added; the solution was covered and shaken at an interval of an hour and then allowed to stand at room temperature for 7 days.
2: Both extracts were combined and concentrated with a rotary evaporator (Heidolph Laborota 4000 efficient) under reduced pressure to obtain dichloromethane extracts.
