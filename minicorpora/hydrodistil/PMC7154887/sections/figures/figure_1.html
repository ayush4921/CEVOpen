 <caption> Expression patterns of Plzf, ID-4, c-Kit, BAX, and Bcl2 genes after treatment with different amounts of T. ammi fruit oil (10, 20, and 30 ÂµL). Expressions of Plzf and ID-4 were increased after treatment with oil, while the expression of c-Kit was decreased. Expression levels of BAX and Bcl2 were decreased and increased after treatment, respectively. Stars show significant differences between treatment groups and the control group ( p &lt; 0.05). </caption>
