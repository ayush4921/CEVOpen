<p>The composition of the essential oil of 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic> fruit, a concentrated hydrophobic liquid containing volatile chemical compounds, was analyzed several times in previous studies using gas-chromatography (GC) or gas-chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) methods. The monoterpenes thymol, carvacrol, γ-terpinene, cymene, and limonene were identified as the main compounds of the oil of the fruit [

 <italic>T. ammi</italic> essential oil varied in previous studies. For instance, the amount of thymol in the oil obtained from fruit ranged from 17% to 71%, indicating the effect of genotype or environmental conditions [
