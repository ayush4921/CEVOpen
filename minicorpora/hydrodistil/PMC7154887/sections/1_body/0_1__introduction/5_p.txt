0: Genetic information is transmitted to the next generation by spermatogonial stem cells, which are extensively rare, composing about 0.03% of germ cells [ 21].
1: Fertility in cancer patients may be threatened due to gonadotoxic therapies, including chemotherapy and irradiation, that can affect the spermatogenesis process.Therefore, protection of germ cells can be considered an alternative strategy to conserve fertility in these patients [ 22].
2: Previous studies revealed protective effects of extracts and natural compounds on spermatogonial cells.
3: For instance, quercetin protected spermatogonial cells in the presence of oxidant agents [ 23].
4: Additionally, the ethanolic extract of  Moringa oleifera reduced cyclophosphamide-induced damage on spermatogonial cells [ 24].
5: Results of previous studies also revealed that the essential oil of  T. ammi caused morphological deformities of the sperm plasma membrane and detachment of head-to-tail coiling.
6: This suggested that the oil is suitable to be applied as a spermicidal agent in vaginal contraceptives [ 25, 26].
7: However, in Iranian Traditional Medicine the plant has a reputation of having an aphrodisiac effect, with galactagogue and diuretic properties [ 27].
8: There is no research regarding the effect of the plant on spermatogonial cells; therefore, the present study aims to evaluate the effect of the plants oil on the viability of spermatogonial stem cells in vitro.
