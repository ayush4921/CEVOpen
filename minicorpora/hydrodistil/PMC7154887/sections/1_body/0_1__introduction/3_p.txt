0: The composition of the essential oil of  T. ammi fruit, a concentrated hydrophobic liquid containing volatile chemical compounds, was analyzed several times in previous studies using gas-chromatography (GC) or gas-chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) methods.
1: The monoterpenes thymol, carvacrol, -terpinene, cymene, and limonene were identified as the main compounds of the oil of the fruit [ 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].
2: The content and composition of  T. ammi essential oil varied in previous studies.
3: For instance, the amount of thymol in the oil obtained from fruit ranged from 17% to 71%, indicating the effect of genotype or environmental conditions [ 11, 12].
4: Salt stress caused significant reductions in the weights of the plants parts and its fruits, whereas the concentration of fruit oil was not affected by salt stress [ 12].
5: Aside from volatile compounds, other active primary and secondary metabolites such as carbohydrates, proteins, vitamins, minerals, tannins, carotenoids, alkaloids, steroids, saponins, and flavonoids were identified in the whole plant [ 13].
6: Water soluble constituents of the fruit have also been elucidated, including one monoterpenoid, five new monoterpenoid glucosides, two aromatic compound glucosides, and two glucides [ 14].
