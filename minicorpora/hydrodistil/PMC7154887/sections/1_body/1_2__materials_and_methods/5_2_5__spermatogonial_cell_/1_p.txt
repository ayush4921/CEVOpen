0: The cells, divided into 4 groups (3 treatment groups and 1 control group), were cultured for 2 weeks.
1: Basic medium cultures contained MEM, nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 10% FBS, 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma), 10 3 U/mL human recombinant leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF; B&D, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 g/mL streptomycin (both from Sigma).
2: The essential oil of  T. ammi was added to the cell cultures in amounts of 10, 20, and 30 L. The culture media were changed every other day and stored at 35 C in an atmosphere humidified with 5% CO 2.
3: The diameter and number of colonies were evaluated using an inverted microscope (Ziess, Jena, Germany), and captured images were processed by imageJ software [ 29].
