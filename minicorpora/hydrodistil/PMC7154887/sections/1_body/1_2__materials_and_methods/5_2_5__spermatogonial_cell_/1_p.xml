<p>The cells, divided into 4 groups (3 treatment groups and 1 control group), were cultured for 2 weeks. Basic medium cultures contained MEMα, nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 10% FBS, 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma), 10
 <sup>3</sup> U/mL human recombinant leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF; B&amp;D, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 µg/mL streptomycin (both from Sigma). The essential oil of
