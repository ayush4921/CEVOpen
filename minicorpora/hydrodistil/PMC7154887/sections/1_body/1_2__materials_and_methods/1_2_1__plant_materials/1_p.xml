 <italic>T. ammi</italic> fruit was purchased from local medicinal plant shops in Tehran Province, Iran (2014) and identified at the herbarium of the Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences. In order to obtain essential oil, the fruit (100 g) was subjected to the hydrodistillation method, using a Clevenger-type apparatus. The plant material was poured into a glass balloon with sufficient distilled water (about 500 mL) and heated until boiling for 4 h. The obtained oil was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and stored in a sealed, dark glass vial in a refrigerator (4 ÂºC) until further investigation.
