0: Flow cytometry was performed to assess  Stra8-positive cells that had been isolated from testes.
1: A total of 10 6 cells were suspended in 100 L of PBS/fetal bovine serum (FBS), and 10 L of a primary antibody (anti- Stra8 antibody, cat.
2: no.
3: ab49602, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) was added to the cell suspension (20 min, 4 C).
4: Cells were then washed with 1 mL of PBS/FBS.
5: Subsequently, 10 L of a secondary antibody (donkey antirabbit, cat.
6: no.
7: ab6798, Abcam) conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) was added (20 min, 4 C).
8: Cells used as controls were not treated with antibodies.
9: Cells were kept in the dark on ice until analysis by flow cytometry [ 29].
