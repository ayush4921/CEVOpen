 <italic>Stra8</italic> antibody, cat. no. ab49602, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) was added to the cell suspension (20 min, 4 °C). Cells were then washed with 1 mL of PBS/FBS. Subsequently, 10 µL of a secondary antibody (donkey antirabbit, cat. no. ab6798, Abcam) conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) was added (20 min, 4 °C). Cells used as controls were not treated with antibodies. Cells were kept in the dark on ice until analysis by flow cytometry [
