0: The pluripotency of the spermatogonial cells was examined by evaluating the expression levels of  ID-4 and  Plzf alongside the apoptosis regulators  BAX,  Bcl2, and tyrosine-protein kinase ( c-Kit) using real-time PCR.
1: The sequence of primers is indicated in  Table 1.
2: Total RNA was extracted by an RNase kit (Accuzole Total RNA Extraction Kit, K-3090, Kentucky, USA) according to the manufacturers instructions.
3: One microgram of total RNA was used in the synthesis of cDNA using reverse a transcription kit (Thermo Scientific, K1621, Kentucky, USA).
4: Real-time PCR was performed with 40 reaction amplifications using 7500 fast real-time PCR and the detection of SYBR Green (Applied Bioscience, Carlsbad, CA, USA).
5: All samples were normalized against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (internal control) using the comparative CT method (CT) [ 28].
