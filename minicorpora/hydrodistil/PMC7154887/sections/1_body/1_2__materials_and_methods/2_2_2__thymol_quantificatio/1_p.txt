0: According to the composition previously reported in our study, thymol is the major component of the plants oil [ 11].
1: Therefore, the amount of thymol was analyzed quantitatively using a Dani Master GC (Dani, Italy) with an OV1 column (SE54CB, 25 m  0.25 mm internal diameter 0.25 m film thickness), nitrogen as a carrier gas, with a split ratio of 1:30, and a flame ionization detector (FID).
2: Temperature programming was performed from 75 C (42 min) to 250 C (14 min) at 15 C/min.
3: Injector and detector temperatures were 250 and 260 C, respectively.
4: Thymol with a concentration of 12.5 to 100 L/mL was prepared to obtain the calibration curve.
5: The oil of the fruit was injected into the column under the same conditions, and the amount of thymol was calculated using the following equations (Equations (1) and (2)): Y = 0.0341X0.378  (1)R  2 = 0.98  (2)
