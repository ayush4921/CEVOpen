All the oil treatments (most of all, 20 µL of the oil) increased the diameter and number of colonies significantly more than the control group. Antioxidants can suppress the deteriorative effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress that can affect cell membranes, structural proteins, enzymes, and nucleic acids [

As it was indicated, thymol composed the main part of the tested oil, which displayed favorable effects on spermatogonial cells in the medium. Thymol exhibits antioxidation activity by inhibiting free radicals, chelating metal ions, and enhancing endogenous antioxidants, dependent or independent of enzymes [

 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> to H
 <sub>2</sub>O and O) increased the number and diameter of colonies. The obtained results are attributed to the presence of the mentioned antioxidants in the cell culture [
