<p>Several beneficial effects have been attributed to 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic>, such as aphrodisiac properties, which led us to evaluate the effect of 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic> oil on the viability of spermatogonial cells in vitro. The results of the present study revealed that like previous reports, thymol composed the main part of the fruit oil of 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic>. Different amounts of thymol were presented (17% to 71%) in previous analyses [
 <xref rid="B11-plants-09-00343" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], while the oil tested on spermatogonial cells in the present study contained 74.2% thymol. Thus, thymol as a major component was assayed in the oil using the GC method according to the thymol calibration curve.
