 <p>Citrus is one of the largest output fruits in the word. In China, the major orange variety is the 
  <italic>Citrus reticulate</italic> Blanco (Ponkan). The peels are discarded as waste material, its comprehensive utilization is urgently needed. In this work, hydrodistillation method was developed to extract citrus essential oil (EO) from Blanco peel. With the optimal extraction conditions, the EO yield was more than 3%. By GC-MS analysis, 53 compounds were identified from the citrus EO. Terpenes compounds accounted for 71.2%, especially 
  <italic>d</italic>-limonene (major composition) accounted for 58.9%. The obtained citrus EO showed remarkable antibacterial activity against 
  <italic>Cutibacterium acnes</italic> (
  <italic>C. acnes</italic>, Formerly 
  <italic>P. acnes</italic>) and common microorganisms such as 
  <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
  <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, and 
  <italic>E. coli</italic>. Even compared with the common antibiotics (such as erythromycin, clindamycin, and tetracycline) for acne therapy, its antibacterial activity against 
  <italic>C. acnes</italic> is more excellent. This work provides a potential therapy material for the treatment of acne.
