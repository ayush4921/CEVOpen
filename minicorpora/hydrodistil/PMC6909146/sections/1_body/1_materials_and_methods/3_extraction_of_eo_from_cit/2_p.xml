<p id="p0035">Citrus EO was extracted from citrus peel by hydrodistillation. Hydrodistillation is a variant of traditional steam distillation method for the extraction of EO from plant in the laboratory. A micro Dean-Stark apparatus was used for hydrodistillation. 50 g of crushed citrus peel was placed into the flask along with 250 mL distilled water (in a ratio of 1g solid: 5ml water), the samples materials was immersed directly into the distilled water. The solid-liquid mixture was heated until it boiled under atmospheric pressure. The volatile aroma compounds and water formed an azeotropic (azeotropes) mixture, condensed and divided due to their density difference and immiscibility. After subjecting the citrus material to hydrodistillation for 2 h, the essential oil was collected and isolated. Subsequently, the essential oil was dried with Na
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>, collected into sealed vials and stored in a refrigerator (4 Â°C) for further use. Thus, gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis and antibacterial activity evaluation.
