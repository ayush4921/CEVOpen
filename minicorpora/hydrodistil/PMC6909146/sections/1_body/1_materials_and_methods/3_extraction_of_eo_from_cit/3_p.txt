0: To obtain the optimal extraction conditions, the effect of hydrodistillation time, citrus peel grinding degree, and additional salts on citrus EO yield was investigated.
1: To study the reciprocal influence of independent variables (hydrodistillation time, citrus peel grinding degree and additional reagent  ie.
2: an amount of NaCl) on the citrus EO yield, a 3 factors 3 levels orthogonal experiment design L 9(33) optimization experiments were performed, shown in  Table 1.
3: Its data were analyzed by IBM SPSS Statistics 24.0.
