0: Citrus EO was extracted from citrus peel by hydrodistillation.
1: Hydrodistillation is a variant of traditional steam distillation method for the extraction of EO from plant in the laboratory.
2: A micro Dean-Stark apparatus was used for hydrodistillation.
3: 50 g of crushed citrus peel was placed into the flask along with 250 mL distilled water (in a ratio of 1g solid: 5ml water), the samples materials was immersed directly into the distilled water.
4: The solid-liquid mixture was heated until it boiled under atmospheric pressure.
5: The volatile aroma compounds and water formed an azeotropic (azeotropes) mixture, condensed and divided due to their density difference and immiscibility.
6: After subjecting the citrus material to hydrodistillation for 2 h, the essential oil was collected and isolated.
7: Subsequently, the essential oil was dried with Na 2SO 4, collected into sealed vials and stored in a refrigerator (4 C) for further use.
8: Thus, gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis and antibacterial activity evaluation.
