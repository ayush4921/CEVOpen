<p id="p0040">To obtain the optimal extraction conditions, the effect of hydrodistillation time, citrus peel grinding degree, and additional salts on citrus EO yield was investigated. To study the reciprocal influence of independent variables (hydrodistillation time, citrus peel grinding degree and additional reagent
