0: The components of the citrus EO were identified by GCMS analyses ( Gonzalez-Mas et al., 2019).
1: The samples were diluted in 1000 fold with dichloromethane.
2: The Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Agilent GC-MSD GC6890-MS5973) was incorporated with a capillary column (DB-Wax, 30 m  0.25 mm id, film thickness 0.25 m).
3: The inlet temperature was 250 C. Helium was used as the carrier gas with 1 mL/min.
4: The split ratio was 10:1.
5: The oven temperature was programmed: initial temperature was kept at 40 C for 8 min, and increased from 40 C to 140 C with 3 C/min, further increased to 250 C with 10 C/min, and held at 250 C for 10 min.
6: FID and MSD transfer line temperatures were set at 300 and 250 C, respectively.
7: EI mass spectra (70 eV) were acquired over the m/z range of 35550.
8: Most of the compounds were identified according to Kovats Indexes in reference to n-alkanes and mass spectra (the NIST/NBS, Wiley libraries collection).
9: For the determination of compound contents, the relative area percentages obtained by FID were used.
