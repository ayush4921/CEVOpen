<p id="p0050">The components of the citrus EO were identified by GC–MS analyses (
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">González-Mas et al., 2019</xref>). The samples were diluted in 1000 fold with dichloromethane. The Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Agilent GC-MSD GC6890-MS5973) was incorporated with a capillary column (DB-Wax, 30 m × 0.25 mm id, film thickness 0.25 μm). The inlet temperature was 250 °C. Helium was used as the carrier gas with 1 mL/min. The split ratio was 10:1. The oven temperature was programmed: initial temperature was kept at 40 °C for 8 min, and increased from 40 °C to 140 °C with 3 °C/min, further increased to 250 °C with 10 °C/min, and held at 250 °C for 10 min. FID and MSD transfer line temperatures were set at 300 and 250 °C, respectively. EI mass spectra (70 eV) were acquired over the m/z range of 35–550. Most of the compounds were identified according to Kovats Indexes in reference to n-alkanes and mass spectra (the NIST/NBS, Wiley libraries collection). For the determination of compound contents, the relative area percentages obtained by FID were used.
