0: The minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) values were obtained using the serial dilution bioassay.
1: Bacterial strain inoculums were cultured for 24 h with Wilkins-Chalgren Anaerobe broth.
2: Citrus EO was in series of two-fold and diluted with medium broth resulting in final oil concentrations of 20.00, 10.00, 5.00, 2.50, and 1.25 L/mL.
3: The 96-well microplate was prepared with 95 L of medium broth and 5 L of the  C. acnes seed broth into each well.
4: Then, 100 L of serially diluted citrus EO dilutions were added into the 10 consecutive rows wells with duplicate rows for one dilution.
5: The last two rows wells were used as the negative control, containing 195 L of medium broth and 5 L of seed broth without citrus EO.
6: The final volume was 200 L in each well.
7: After incubating for 48 h at a temperature of 37 C and under anaerobic condition, bacterial growth was recorded by a microplate reader (Multiskan FC, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Shanghai, China).
8: The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of citrus EO to inhibit the growth of the microorganisms.
9: The experimental groups were replicated three times.
