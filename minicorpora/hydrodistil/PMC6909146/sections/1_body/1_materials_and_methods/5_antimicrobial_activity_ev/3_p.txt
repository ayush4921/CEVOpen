0: Disk diffusion assay was performed initially to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of citrus EO against  C. acnes.
1: Comparing with common microorganism such as  S. aureus,  B. subtilis,  E. coli were also applied.
2: Sterile water and  d-limonene were used as the negative and positivecontrols respectively.
3: The bacterial suspensions were 1010 3 fold when diluted in Ringer's solution.
4: 100 L of appropriate diluted bacterial suspensions was spread on the corresponding agar 100 mm diameter Petri dishes, in order to provide initial inoculums of 10 5 or 10 7 CFU/mL.
5: Subsequently, 6 mm diameter sterile dry paper disks were placed onto the inoculated agar surface containing 5 L of citrus EO or of its positive and negative control ( d-limonene and water).
6: The  S. aureus,  B. subtilis,  E. coli, Petri dishes were incubated at 37 C for 24 h. And to  C. acnes, Petri dishes were incubated at 37 C for 48 h under anaerobic condition.
7: After incubation, the inhibition zones were measured in mm.
8: All experiments were carried out at least in triplicates and the mean values were are presented.
