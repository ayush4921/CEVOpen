<p id="p0065">To further evaluate the antimicrobial efficiency of citrus EO against 
 <italic>C. acnes</italic>, we compared its antimicrobial activity with the traditional antibiotics (such as clindamycin 0.1 mg/mL, erythromycin 0.1 mg/mL, and tetracycline 50 μg/mL) against 
 <italic>C. acnes</italic> using disk diffusion assay. The experimental conditions were the same as former method. The inhibition zones were measured as the antimicrobial activity index.
