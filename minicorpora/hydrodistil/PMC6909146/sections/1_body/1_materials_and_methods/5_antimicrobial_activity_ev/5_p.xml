<p id="p0070">The minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) values were obtained using the serial dilution bioassay. Bacterial strain inoculums were cultured for 24 h with Wilkins-Chalgren Anaerobe broth. Citrus EO was in series of two-fold and diluted with medium broth resulting in final oil concentrations of 20.00, 10.00, 5.00, 2.50, and 1.25 μL/mL. The 96-well microplate was prepared with 95 μL of medium broth and 5 μL of the 
 <italic>C. acnes</italic> seed broth into each well. Then, 100 μL of serially diluted citrus EO dilutions were added into the 10 consecutive rows wells with duplicate rows for one dilution. The last two rows wells were used as the negative control, containing 195 μL of medium broth and 5 μL of seed broth without citrus EO. The final volume was 200 μL in each well. After incubating for 48 h at a temperature of 37 °C and under anaerobic condition, bacterial growth was recorded by a microplate reader (Multiskan FC, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Shanghai, China). The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of citrus EO to inhibit the growth of the microorganisms. The experimental groups were replicated three times.
