<p id="p0060">Disk diffusion assay was performed initially to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of citrus EO against 
 <italic>C. acnes</italic>. Comparing with common microorganism such as 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> were also applied. Sterile water and 
 <italic>d</italic>-limonene were used as the negative and positivecontrols respectively. The bacterial suspensions were 10–10
 <sup>3</sup> fold when diluted in Ringer's solution. 100 μL of appropriate diluted bacterial suspensions was spread on the corresponding agar 100 mm diameter Petri dishes, in order to provide initial inoculums of 10
 <sup>5</sup> or 10
 <sup>7</sup> CFU/mL. Subsequently, 6 mm diameter sterile dry paper disks were placed onto the inoculated agar surface containing 5 μL of citrus EO or of its positive and negative control (
 <italic>d</italic>-limonene and water). The 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, Petri dishes were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. And to 
 <italic>C. acnes</italic>, Petri dishes were incubated at 37 °C for 48 h under anaerobic condition. After incubation, the inhibition zones were measured in mm. All experiments were carried out at least in triplicates and the mean values were are presented.
