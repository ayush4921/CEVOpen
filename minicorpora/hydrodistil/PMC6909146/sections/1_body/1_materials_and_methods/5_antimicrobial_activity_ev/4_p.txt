0: To further evaluate the antimicrobial efficiency of citrus EO against  C. acnes, we compared its antimicrobial activity with the traditional antibiotics (such as clindamycin 0.1 mg/mL, erythromycin 0.1 mg/mL, and tetracycline 50 g/mL) against  C. acnes using disk diffusion assay.
1: The experimental conditions were the same as former method.
2: The inhibition zones were measured as the antimicrobial activity index.
