<p id="p0115">In order to make full use of wastes from citrus processing industry, a thorough study was carried out on 
 <italic>Citrus reticulate</italic> Blanco (Ponkan) peels. This citrus is one of the most maximum output orange variety around China. It is significant to note that peels of this citrus variety provides outstanding EO yield, more than 3%. GC-MS analysis of 
 <italic>C. reticulate</italic> essential oil led to identification of 53 chemical components representing 96.87% (
 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Terpenes form the main class compounds, representing 71.2%, and 
 <italic>d</italic>-limonene representing 58.9%. It is appealing that the obtained citrus peel EO showed remarkable antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>C. acnes</italic>, which provides a potential therapy for the treatment of acne. However, further research is needed to investigate their biological activities mechanism and mode of action with 
 <italic>C. acnes</italic> in order to use this EO at the commercial level.
