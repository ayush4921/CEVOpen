<p id="p0010">Citrus is one of the four largest harvested fruits in the world, and its yield and consumption rank first. With increasing demands, citrus production record is still creating. According to FAO report, global citrus output increased from 115.18 million tons to 178.48 million tons from 2010 to 2015. Citrus peel accounts for 25%–40% of the total fruit weight, and its annual output is as high as 10 million tons in China. As such, it's an important biological resource to be comprehensively utilized (

Compendium of Materia Medica (a Chinese Medical Classics by Li Shizhen) records that orange peel (i.e. dried orange peel) is an important traditional Chinese medicine and can relieve vomiting, diarrhea, phlegm and cough. Citrus essential oil (EO) is an important biologically active substance from citrus peel. It is intensively collected in oil glands of the citrus peel (

Citrus EO is widely used in food, chemical industry, medical treatment, and other fields because of its pleasant aroma, antioxidant properties, and antimicrobial activity. Especially its natural product characteristics is attractive. The previous research indicated that citrus EO had broad-spectrum antibacterial activity to bacteria and yeasts, and its antimicrobial activity mainly depends on the components of EO (
