<p id="p0015">Acne is a chronic inflammatory dermatosis involving hair follicles and sebaceous glands which often occurs in the face, chest, and back. The incidence of acne is as high as 85%. Although it is not a life-threatening disease, it has a great psychological impact on patient's life (

 <italic>Cutibacterium acnes</italic> (
 <italic>C. acnes</italic>, formerly 
 <italic>Propionibacterium acnes</italic>) is the dominant pathogen bacterial to acne, which is an anaerobic Gram-positive Corynebacterium (
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Scharschmidt, 2019</xref>). Consequently, 
 <italic>C. acnes</italic> has been recognized as one of the main targets for acne treatment (
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Webster, 1996</xref>). The bacteriostasis or killing of 
 <italic>C. acnes</italic> are one of the key routes to prevent and treat acne. Currently, erythromycin and clindamycin are the main antibiotics for treating 
 <italic>C. acne</italic> (
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Shaw and Kennedy, 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Ruga et al., 2018</xref>). The traditional antibiotic therapy to acne have various side effects. For instance, it can lead to dryness, redness, irritation of the skin and hyperpigmentation, and in an extreme instance, malpractice can lead to antibiotic resistance of the bacteria (
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Coates et al., 2002</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Dessinioti and Katsambas, 2017</xref>). Traditional medical plants and their extracts provide good choices for the treatment of 
 <italic>C. acne</italic> and show excellent results in bacteriostasis research (
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Hamdy et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Jeong and Kim, 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Poomanee et al., 2018</xref>). EOs from other plant extracts have good antimicrobial properties and they are valid against 
 <italic>C. acne</italic> (
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Millerm A et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Murbach Teles Andrade et al., 2018</xref>). Citrus EO contains a lot of bioactive substances (
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Dosoky and Setzer, 2018</xref>). Previous studies showed that it had obvious antimicrobial activities such as against 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Salmonella enteritidis</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic>, 
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, 
 <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic>, 
 <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic> (
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Mitropoulou et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Reyes-Jurado et al., 2016</xref>). However, the antimicrobial activity of citrus EO against 
 <italic>C. acne</italic> has not been reported. If citrus EO possesses the antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>C. acne</italic>, it can therefore be as a potential natural product for acne therapy to replace antibiotics. Based on its product characteristics, it must be very attractive and well received by acne patients.
