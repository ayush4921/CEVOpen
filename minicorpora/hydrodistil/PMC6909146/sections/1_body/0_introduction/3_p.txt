0: Acne is a chronic inflammatory dermatosis involving hair follicles and sebaceous glands which often occurs in the face, chest, and back.
1: The incidence of acne is as high as 85%.
2: Although it is not a life-threatening disease, it has a great psychological impact on patient's life ( Dreno et al., 2019).
3: Cutibacterium acnes ( C. acnes, formerly  Propionibacterium acnes) is the dominant pathogen bacterial to acne, which is an anaerobic Gram-positive Corynebacterium ( Scharschmidt, 2019).
4: Consequently,  C. acnes has been recognized as one of the main targets for acne treatment ( Webster, 1996).
5: The bacteriostasis or killing of  C. acnes are one of the key routes to prevent and treat acne.
6: Currently, erythromycin and clindamycin are the main antibiotics for treating  C. acne ( Shaw and Kennedy, 2007;  Ruga et al., 2018).
7: The traditional antibiotic therapy to acne have various side effects.
8: For instance, it can lead to dryness, redness, irritation of the skin and hyperpigmentation, and in an extreme instance, malpractice can lead to antibiotic resistance of the bacteria ( Coates et al., 2002;  Dessinioti and Katsambas, 2017).
9: Traditional medical plants and their extracts provide good choices for the treatment of  C. acne and show excellent results in bacteriostasis research ( Hamdy et al., 2017;  Jeong and Kim, 2017;  Poomanee et al., 2018).
10: EOs from other plant extracts have good antimicrobial properties and they are valid against  C. acne ( Millerm A et al., 2015;  Murbach Teles Andrade et al., 2018).
11: Citrus EO contains a lot of bioactive substances ( Dosoky and Setzer, 2018).
12: Previous studies showed that it had obvious antimicrobial activities such as against  Escherichia coli,  Salmonella enteritidis,  Staphylococcus epidermidis,  Listeria monocytogenes,  Acinetobacter baumannii,  Mycobacterium smegmatis ( Mitropoulou et al., 2017;  Reyes-Jurado et al., 2016).
13: However, the antimicrobial activity of citrus EO against  C. acne has not been reported.
14: If citrus EO possesses the antibacterial activity against  C. acne, it can therefore be as a potential natural product for acne therapy to replace antibiotics.
15: Based on its product characteristics, it must be very attractive and well received by acne patients.
