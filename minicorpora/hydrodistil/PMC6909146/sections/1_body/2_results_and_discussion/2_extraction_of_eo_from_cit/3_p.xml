<p id="p0085">To study the reciprocal influence of independent variables (hydrodistillation time, citrus peel grinding degree and additional reagent (the amount of NaCl) on citrus EO extraction efficiency, an orthogonal experiment design optimization experiments were performed as shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The experiment result was shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, and the variance analysis was given in 
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. From the variance analysis results, the significance of the three factors to citrus EO extraction is A (Grinding degree)&gt;B (Hydrodistillation time)&gt;C (NaCl). According to 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, the optimal condition was A3B3C2. With this condition, 
 <italic>i.e.</italic> 30 Mesh citrus peel and 2 h hydrodistillation time with adding 2% NaCl, citrus EO yield reached 3.26%. These optimal conditions were further verified by an additional experiment and the yield of citrus EO was 3.23%.
