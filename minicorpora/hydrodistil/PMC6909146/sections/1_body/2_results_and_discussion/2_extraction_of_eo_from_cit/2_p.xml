<p id="p0080">Citrus EO was extracted from ponkan peel by hydrodistillation. From the pre-experiment, there was an indications that the hydrodistillation time, citrus peel grinding degree and additives were important factors which has the tendency to affect the citrus EO yield. Hence, the effect of citrus peel grinding degree, hydrodistillation time and additives on citrus EO yield were investigated. The results were shown in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> to 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>. From the results, citrus peel grinding degree, hydrodistillation time and additional NaCl obviously affected the citrus EO yield. Extending the extraction time to 2 h, the citrus EO yield would reach to its highest about 3.1%. The grinding degree was another key factor to citrus EO yield, the highest citrus EO yield could be obtained as the citrus peel scrap through 20–30 mesh (
 <italic>i.e.</italic> with about 0.83 to 0.55 mm size as shown in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Smaller particle size favored EO extraction since it had a better mass transfer. However, instance where the particle size was too small, the particles were easily aggregated, thereby reducing the EO extraction. Addition of some salt will promote the EO extraction yield (

 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> and (NH
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>, which promote citrus EO extraction. The results were shown in 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>. It confirmed that common salts could promote citrus EO extraction to some degree. Especially, adding NaCl has a sigificant promoting efficiency of EO extraction, the yield was enhanced about 20% compared with the control. Addition of salt promote the EO extraction due to the fact that it help the oil sacs of plant cells to be released from the citrus peel.
