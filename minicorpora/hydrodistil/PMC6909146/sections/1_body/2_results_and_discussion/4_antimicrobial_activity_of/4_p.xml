<p id="p0110">The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) usually used to detect the antimicrobial efficacy of antimicrobial agents is a basic indicator of drug detection. This experiment was carried out to determine the antimicrobial activity of citrus EO against 
 <italic>C. acnes</italic>, it provided basic application data for citrus EO application as an antimicrobial agents for 
 <italic>C. acnes</italic>. The MIC of citrus EO to 
 <italic>C. acnes</italic> and common microbe 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> was detected. Also, the 
 <italic>d</italic>-limonene was used as a positive control. The results were given in 
 <xref rid="tbl6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>. The MIC of citrus EO to 
 <italic>C. acnes</italic> was 2.5 μL/mL, and it was 1.25 μL/mL to 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 2.5 μL/mL to 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Guo et al. reported that the MIC of Cold Pressed Gannan orange EO was 1.56 μL/mL to 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 3.13 μL/mL to 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al., 2018</xref>). Their results were almost consistent with our results. The subtle difference maybe due to varied citrus, Gannan orange in their case and ponkan in our case. The minimum concentration was about 2.5 μL/mL when citrus EO was used to treat acne. Acording to the disk diffusion assay and MIC results, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> were also sensitive to citrus EO. This shows that citrus EO can be a potential antibacterial agent against these bacterials.
