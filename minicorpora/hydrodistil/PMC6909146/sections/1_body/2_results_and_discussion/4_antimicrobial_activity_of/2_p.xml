<p id="p0100">The antimicrobial activity of the citrus EO against 
 <italic>C. acnes</italic> was firstly assayed by disk diffusion assay. Comparation of its antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> were also conducted. The major constituent, 
 <italic>d</italic>-limonene, was simultaneously assessed. The inhibition zones results were given in 
 <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. These results evidenced that 
 <italic>C. acnes</italic> was sensitive to citrus EO and its major constituent, 
 <italic>d</italic>-limonene. As expected, the other chosen microbes were also sensitive to citrus EO and 
 <italic>d</italic>-limonene. This is consistent with the reported results by 
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Mitropoulou et al. (2017)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al. (2018)</xref>. Of note, the large inhibition zones (21 mm) were observed in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. While the inhibition zones for 
 <italic>C. acnes</italic> (13.5 mm) is larger than that of 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (9.3 mm). To our knowledge, this is the first report on antimicrobial activity of citrus EO against 
 <italic>C. acnes</italic>, also it is the first report that anaerobic bacterium is sensitive to citrus EO.
