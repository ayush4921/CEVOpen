<p id="p0105">To assess the feasibility of citrus EO as a potential therapy against 
 <italic>C. acnes</italic> as an alternative for traditional antibiotics, we further evaluated the antimicrobial activity of the citrus EO and common acne antibiotics (
 <italic>i.e.</italic> erythromycin, clindamycin, and tetracycline) against 
 <italic>C. acnes</italic> by disk diffusion assay. Results were given in 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>. It can be seen that the inhibition zones diameter of 
 <italic>C. acnes</italic> was largest for citrus EO, and it followed by clindamycin, tetracycline and erythromycin. Compared with the traditional antibiotics by disk diffusion, the antimicrobial activity of citrus EO against 
 <italic>C. acnes</italic> was about 1.2-fold to clindamycin, 1.8-fold to tetracycline, and almost 3.5-fold to erythromycin. Mitropoulou reported that citrus medica essential oil perform almost similar antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> with gentamycin (
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Mitropoulou et al., 2017</xref>). Simultaneously, the previous reported work shows that citrus EO is enough and safe to human (
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Dosoky and Setzer, 2018</xref>). This indicates that citrus EO could be applied as an antibacterial active substance against 
 <italic>C. acnes</italic> pathogenic bacterium to replace traditional antibiotics.
