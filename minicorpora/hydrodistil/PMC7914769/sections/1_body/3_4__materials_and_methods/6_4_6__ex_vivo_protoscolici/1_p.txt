0: The livers of sheep that were naturally infected with hydatid cysts were used to evaluate the protoscolicidal activity of FMEO.
1: At first, more than 50% of the hydatid fluid was extracted from the cysts, and then, FMEO was added to the cysts at concentrations of 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 L/mL.
2: The hydatid fluid was removed from the cyst after 5, 10, 20, and 30 min, stained with 0.1% eosin, and examined under light microscopy for counting [ 56].
