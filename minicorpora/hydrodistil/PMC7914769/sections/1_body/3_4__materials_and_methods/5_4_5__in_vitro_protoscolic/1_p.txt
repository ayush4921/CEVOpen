0: FMEO at the concentrations of 75, 150, and 300 L/mL was added to 200 L of the washed protoscoleces (5  10 3 protoscoleces/mL) for 5, 10, 20, and 30 min at 37 C. After these times, 50 L of 0.1% eosin stain (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was added to the protoscoleces, and the mixtures were placed on a glass slide and examined under a light microscope.
1: We determined the viability percentages via calculating the percentage of dead and live protoscoleces among 300 protoscoleces by means of an eosin exclusion experiment [ 54, 55].
2: This assay is based on the flame cell motility and impermeability to 0.1% eosin solution (1 g of eosin powder in 1000 mL of distilled water); live protoscoleces do not absorb the eosin stain and exhibit characteristic muscular actions and flame cell motion; however, in dead protoscoleces, eosin enters the cell and the protoscoleces become red.
