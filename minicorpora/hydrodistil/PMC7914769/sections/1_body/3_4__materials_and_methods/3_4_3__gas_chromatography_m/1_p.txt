0: A Hewlett-Packard 6890 with an HP-5MS column (30 m  0.25 mm; film thickness, 0.25 mm) was applied to perform the GC analysis.
1: The column temperature was maintained at 50 C for three minutes, programmed to increase to 290 C at a rate of 15 C per min, and kept constant at 290 C for five minutes.
2: The injector and interface temperatures were 250 and 280 C, respectively.
3: The flow rate of helium, the carrier gas, was 1 mL/min C.F.
4: The percentages were determined by the electronic integration of the FID peak areas without the use of response factor correction.
5: The linear retention indices for all the components were determined by the coinjection of the samples with a solution containing a homologous series of C8C24n-alkanes.
6: GC/MS analysis was conducted by means of a Thermoquest-Finnigan gas chromatograph equipped with a fused silica capillary DB-5 column (30 m  0.25 mm; film thickness, 0.25 mm) coupled with a TRACE mass (Manchester, UK).
7: The range of mass was from 40 to 400 u.
8: The compounds of FMEO were determined through the comparison of their relative retention times and mass spectra with the standard Wiley 2001 library data for the GC/MS system or with data reported in the literature [ 53].
