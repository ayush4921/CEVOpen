0: The biological functions of the rhizomes extracts of  R. crenulata have been studied for many years, and their outstanding pharmacological effects have also been gradually revealed.
1: However, the chemical basis, as well as the various bioactivities of this well known medicinal plant still need to be further elucidated.
2: In addition, the essential oil (EO) extracted from  R. crenulata has also aroused the interests of many researchers.
3: It was reported that about 60 volatile components have been identified from the essential oil of  R. crenulata by GC-MS technique, and geraniol and octanol were usually the major compounds identified from the essential oil [ 28, 29].
4: Nevertheless, the antibacterial and antioxidant activity of the essential oil of  R. crenulata has never been reported up to now.
