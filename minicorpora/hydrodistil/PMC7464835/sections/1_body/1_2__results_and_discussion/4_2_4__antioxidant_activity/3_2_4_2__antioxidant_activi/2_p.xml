 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03664-f004">Figure 4</xref> illustrates the reducing power activity of the four identified compounds of 
 <italic>R. crenulata</italic>. Generally, the four compounds exhibited good reducing ability, and their antioxidant activity was concentration-dependent. Moreover, their reduction power was in the order of rosavin &gt; gallic acid &gt; ethyl gallate &gt; herbacetin &gt; BHT. Furthermore, the antioxidant activity of the four identified compounds was higher than that of the essential oil or crude extracts. Excellent antioxidant activity of the extracts and compounds from 
 <italic>R. crenulata</italic> might be closely relate to its pharmacological functions, such as anti-aging effect [
