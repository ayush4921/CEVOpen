<p>The light yellow essential oil (EO) with fragrant flavor was successfully obtained from the rhizomes of 
 <italic>R. crenulata</italic> by steam distillation extraction. The yield (
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic>) of EO was determined as 0.27%. Results of GC–MS analysis revealed the EO was abundant in alcohols, monoterpenes, ketones, aldehydes, esters, alkanes and acids (listed in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-03664-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Notably, the alcohols and monoterpenes accounted nearly for over 95% of the total oil. The major components of EO were 1-octanol (42.217%), geraniol (19.914%), 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-ol (13.151%), prenol (4.21%), linalool (3.89%), 1-decanol (3.35%), 3-methyl-1-buten-3-ol (2.92%), and 1-hexanol (2.42%). Generally, many of the volatile constituents identified in this study had been reported by other articles [

 <xref rid="B30-molecules-25-03664" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, the contents of each compound might be diverse in different researches. In our research, the amount of 1-octanol was the highest, followed by the geraniol. However, in Lei’s research, geraniol was the most abundant with the concentration of 53.32%, and 1-octanol listed the second with an amount of 13.39% [

 <italic>R. crenulata</italic> which were collected at different locations, and it might infer that the chemical constitution and amount of 
 <italic>R. crenulata</italic> essential oil was closely related with its habitat [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-25-03664" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Of course, several other factors might also affect its chemical composition and content, such as harvesting conditions, the level of growth and maturation, storage and handling conditions, etc.
