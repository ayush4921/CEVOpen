<p>As shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-03664-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, gallic acid, ethyl gallate, and herbacetin showed excellent inhibitory activity against the test bacteria, except rosavin. Of them, ethyl gallate exhibited the strongest antibacterial activity, and its MIC value to the five typical test bacteria was 0.24 mg/mL, and its MBC value was determined as 0.48 mg/mL. Herbacetin showed better inhibitory activity to 
 <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> and 
 <italic>S. dysenteriae</italic> than gallic acid, and its MIC values against the two bacteria strains was 0.24 mg/mL. It could be concluded that ethyl gallate, gallic acid and herbacetin were three important components which could inhibit the growth of the five clinical pathogenic bacteria, and they might contribute to the antibacterial activity of EE. These results would provide more clues to reveal the material basis of 
 <italic>R. crenulata</italic> in treating diarrhea and scald, which would also help to understand the traditional use in Chinese traditional medicine [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-25-03664" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Furthermore, the antibacterial mechanism of the crude extracts and the identified compounds need to be elucidated more clearly, and an in vivo antibacterial activity experiment is required to be conducted in further study.
