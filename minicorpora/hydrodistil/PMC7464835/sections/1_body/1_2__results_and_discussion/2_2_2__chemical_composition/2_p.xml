<p>In our previous preliminary investigation, we found that the EE exhibited good biological activity among the five crude extracts. It is very meaningful to find out which kinds of components could play a key role in the bioactivity of EE. Therefore, the EE was selected to be subjected to the HPLC analysis for the purpose of determining the relative active compounds. By comparing the retention times with the standards, a total of four compounds in the EE of 
 <italic>R. crenulata</italic> were successfully identified, which were gallic acid (1), ethyl gallate (2), rosavin (3), and herbacetin (4) (listed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03664-f002">Figure 2</xref>). The content of gallic acid, ethyl gallage and rosavin in EE were determined as 4.13 ± 0.23 mg/g, 0.41 ± 0.06 mg/g, and 2.85 ± 0.17 mg/g, respectively.
