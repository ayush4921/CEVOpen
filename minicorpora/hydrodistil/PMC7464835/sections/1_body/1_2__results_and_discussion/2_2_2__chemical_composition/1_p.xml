<p>The ethanol extract (crude extract, CE) was fractionated by organic solvents, and afforded four extracts, which were petroleum ether extract (PE, 5.21 g), ethyl acetate extract (EE, 12.47 g), 
 <italic>n</italic>-butanol extract (BE, 43.20 g), and water extract (WE, 12.93 g). The yields of these five crude extracts are represented in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-03664-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The total phenolics content of the five extracts of 
 <italic>R. crenulata</italic> was measured in gallic acid equivalent (GAE), and the total flavonoids was calculated in milligrams of rutin equivalent (RE) per gram of extract. As shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-03664-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, the total phenolsâ€™ content of five extracts ranged from 12.0 to 172.0 mg GAE/g extract, and the flavonoids content was from 0 to 163.0 mg SRE/g extract. Generally, the CE, EE and BE were all rich in phenols and flavonoids. Especially, of these five extracts, EE contained the highest quantities of total phenols and flavonoids, with the amount of 171.89 mg GAE/g and 162.04 mg RE/g, respectively. The total phenols content of CE was about 134.91 mg GAE/g, which was lower than the EE, but higher than that of the BE, WE and PE. Moreover, the total flavonoids content of CE and BE was nearly the same, with no significant difference. Nevertheless, the flavonoids were not detected in the crude extracts of PE and WE.
