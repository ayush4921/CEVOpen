<p>The chemical compositions of the essential oil of 
 <italic>R. crenulata</italic> rhizomes were analyzed by GC-MS techniques. A 6890N Network GC system (Agilent, CA, USA) equipped with a HP-5 MS capillary column (30m × 0.25mm, 0.25μm film thickness) was used. Carrier gas helium was run at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min, and the temperature program run from 50 °C (2 min), increased 10 °C/min up to 100 °C, and 2 min at 180 °C, increased 20 °C/min up to 250 °C. Moreover, the GC-MS experiment was run for one time. The chemical constituents of the essential oil were identified by comparing their mass spectra to those in the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) library and those from the literature.
