<p>The content of the total flavonoids was determined by the colorimetric method of Sharma [

 <xref rid="B42-molecules-25-03664" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] with small modifications. About 0.5 mL of each extract (1875 μg/mL) or rutin (28–240 μg/mL) was mixed with 1.5 mL of 10% aluminum chloride, 3 mL of 1M potassium acetate and 5 mL of 75% ethanol. The reaction mixture was maintained for 40 min at room temperature, and the absorbance was measured against a blank at 415 nm. Rutin was used for establishing the standard calibration curve, and the total flavonoids content was calculated in milligrams of rutin equivalent (RE) per gram of extract.
