<p>The ether acetate extract with notable bioactivity was subjected to the HPLC analysis on a LC-10ATvp system. Sample analysis was performed using a C
 <sub>18</sub> column (4.6 mm × 250 mm, 5 μm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA), and an SPD-M10Avp diode-array detector (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) which recorded at 275 nm. The mobile phase was A (water with 2.5% acetic acid) and B (acetonitrile 100%). The HPLC procedure was as follows: 0–2 min, 15% B; 2–10 min, 50% B; 10–30 min, 90% B; 30–40 min, 100% B. The flow rate was 1.0 mL/min at 35 °C, and the infection volume was 20 μL. Seven pure phenolic compounds, including gallic acid, ethyl gallate, rosavin, rutin, quercetin, herbacetin and kaempferol, were used as the reference standards for the identification of the active components in EE. All the standards were purchased from Sichuan Weikeqi Biological Technology Co., Ltd. The quantification of the flavonoids was obtained by using an external standard method [
