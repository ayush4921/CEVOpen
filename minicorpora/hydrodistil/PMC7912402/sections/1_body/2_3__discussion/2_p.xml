<p>The cultivated lavender 
 <italic>L. dentata</italic> essential oil showed eucalyptol (63.5%) as the major compound in the present study, which was higher than that previously reported for both inflorescences (46.3%) and the aerial parts (40.4%) [
 <xref rid="B45-antibiotics-10-00104" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Iranian lavandin (
 <italic>L. hybrida</italic>) has also been characterized by high proportions of oxygenated monoterpenes, with eucalyptol (41.1%) as the main component, followed by borneol (20.7%) and camphor (10.8%) [
 <xref rid="B46-antibiotics-10-00104" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. All of these components were present in 
 <italic>L.hyb</italic> in the present study, although in lower amounts (6.5%, 4.4%, 9.3%, respectively), with the main component here being linalool (33.7%) and linalyl acetate (27.7%). The antifungal activity of linalool on 
 <italic>Candida</italic> species was recently studied by Dias et al. [
 <xref rid="B47-antibiotics-10-00104" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], who indicated the potential use of this unsaturated monoterpene as a strong candidate with antifungal potency. According to Pitarokili et al. [
 <xref rid="B48-antibiotics-10-00104" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], linalyl acetate was inactive against all of the fungi they studied, although it showed weak activity against only 
 <italic>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</italic>. On the contrary, they confirmed the antifungal effects of linalool.
