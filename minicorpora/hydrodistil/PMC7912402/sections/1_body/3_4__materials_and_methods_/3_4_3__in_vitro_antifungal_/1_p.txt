0: The antifungal activities of these  C.cit,  L.dent,  L.hyb,  O.maj1, O.maj2,  M.alt, and  L.nob essential oils were determined according to their contact phase effects on mycelial growth of  A. alternata and  S. cucurbitacearum.
1: For these tests, the essential oils were dissolved in sterilized distilled water with 0.1% ( v/ v) Tween 20 (Sigma Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany), to obtain homogeneous emulsions.
2: The autoclaved PDA medium (cooled to 40 C) had the essential oil emulsions added to obtain the final concentrations of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, and 1 mg/mL.
3: The negative control was PDA containing 0.1% ( v/ v) Tween 20.
4: The positive control was provided by three concentrations (0.1, 0.5, 1 mg/mL) of fungicides as 25 g/L difenoconazole plus 25 g/L fludioxonil (Celest Extra 50 FS; Cambridge, UK).
5: The PDA was mixed and poured immediately into Petri dishes (diameter, 90 mm; 20 mL/plate), and after medium solidification, each plate was inoculated under aseptic conditions with 6 mm plugs of  A. alternata or  S. cucurbitacearum, taken from the edges of actively growing cultures.
6: The experiments were carried out as three replicates per concentration and treatment.
7: The inoculated plates were sealed with Parafilm and incubated for 7 days at 22  2 C with a photoperiod of 12/12 h dark/ ultraviolet light (TL-D 36W BLB 1SL; Philips, Dublin, Ireland).
8: The orthogonal diameters of the colonies were measured daily until the control plates were completely covered by the mycelia.
9: Mycelial growth inhibition was calculated based on Equation (1):  Mycelial growth inhibition (%) = [(dc  dt)/dc]  100  (1) where dc and dt represent the mean diameter of the mycelial growth of the control and treated fungal strains, respectively.
10: Moreover, the IC 50 for mycelial growth inhibition of the fungi was determined from the linear regression between the essential oil concentrations and the mycelial growth inhibition.
