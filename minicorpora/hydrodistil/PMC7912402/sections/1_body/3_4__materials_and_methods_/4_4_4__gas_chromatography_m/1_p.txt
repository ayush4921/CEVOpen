0: The volatile constituents of each essential oil were analyzed by GC-MS as previously reported [ 68].
1: They were processed using a gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890B; Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with a capillary column (Agilent HP-5MS; 30 m  0.25 mm; coating thickness, 0.25 m; Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) and a single quadrupole mass detector (Agilent 5977B; Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA).
2: The analytical conditions were as follows: injector temperature, 220 C; transfer line temperature, 240 C; oven temperature programmed, from 60 C to 240 C at 3 C/min; carrier gas, helium at 1 mL/min; injection volume, 1 L (in 0.5% HPLC grade n-hexane solution); split ratio, 1:25.
3: The full scan acquisition parameters were as follows: scan range, 30  m/z to 300  m/z; scan time, 1.0 s (See  supplementary materials).
