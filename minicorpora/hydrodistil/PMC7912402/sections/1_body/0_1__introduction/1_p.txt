0: Cucurbits are an important source of income for countries in the Mediterranean basin, with a total production of nearly 3,356,669 tonnes in 2018 [ 1].
1: Squash ( Cucurbita maxima Duchesne;  Cucurbita moschata Duchesne) is one of the major cucurbits grown in tropical and temperate regions.
2: Cucurbita spp.
3: can be affected by a number of fungal pathogens, which can cause major economic losses [ 2].
4: The majority of these fungi are seedborne, such as gummy stem blight (with foliar symptoms) and black rot (with fruit symptoms), which are caused by  Stagonosporopsis cucurbitacearum (Fr.)
5: Aveskamp, Gruyter & Verkley (anamorph:  Phoma cucurbitacearum (Fr.)
6: Sacc.
7: ), synonym  Didymella bryoniae (Fuckel) Rehm, and which represent serious diseases that are a major constraint to cucurbit production worldwide [ 2, 3, 4].
8: Nuangmek et al.
9: [ 5] reported that losses in cantaloupe can also reach 100% under conditions conducive to  S. cucurbitacearum.
10: Alternaria alternata (Fr.)
11: Keissl.
12: is the agent of leaf spot, which is a further major factor responsible for low cucurbit production.
13: The genus  Alternaria affects the plant seedlings, leaves, stalks, stems, flowers and fruit.
14: Yield losses of 50% and more can occur under weather conditions that are conducive to leaf spot, and in particular temperatures of 25 to 32 C associated with 40% relative humidity during the day and 95% at night [ 6].
15: Many other pathogens have been detected on cucurbits seeds, such as  Fusarium solani [ 7, 8],  Alternaria cucumerina [ 9],  Paramyrothecium roridum, and  Albifimbria verrucaria [ 10, 11].
