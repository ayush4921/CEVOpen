0: In recent years, alternatives to synthetic fungicides have been investigated due to the extensive use of fungicides for plant and seed treatments, the problems of pathogen resistance to fungicides that this causes, and the increased demand for organic and free-of-residue vegetables [ 20, 21, 22, 23].
1: Natural organic compound, such as plant extracts and essential oils, are among the environmentally friendly alternatives that are being developed and tested for antifungal activities against seedborne pathogens [ 24].
2: Essential oils are a rich source of broad-spectrum antifungal plant-derived metabolites that inhibit both fungal growth and their production of toxic metabolites [ 25].
3: Tea tree essential oil contains terpinen-4-ol, 1,8-cineole, and -terpinene, and at 2%, it has shown potent inhibition of mycelial growth of  Fusarium graminearum, Fusarium culmorum, and  Pyrenophora graminea [ 26].
4: Riccioni and Orzali [ 27] reported that tea tree essential oil represents a source of sustainable eco-friendly botanical fungicides, because of its efficacy in the control of seedborne fungi.
5: The genus  Cymbopogon (Poaceae) is known for its essential oils, especially for extracts of lemongrass ( Cymbopogon citratus (DC.)
6: Stapf).
7: The in vitro evaluation of the effectiveness of this essential oil on the main seedborne pathogens of cucurbits was reported previously [ 28, 29, 30].
