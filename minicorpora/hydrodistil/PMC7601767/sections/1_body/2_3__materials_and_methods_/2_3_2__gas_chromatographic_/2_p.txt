0: Gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GC-MS) was carried out as previously described [ 72]: Agilent Technologies HP 7890A Plus Chromatograph (Santa Clara, CA, USA), HP-5ms (30 m  0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 m) column, HP 5973 MSD mass detector, He carrier gas (1 mL/min), MS ionization voltage = 70 eV, emission current = 40 mA, acquisitions range = 35350 amu, sampling rate = 1.0 scan/s.
1: The GC operating conditions were the same as those used for GC-FID.
2: The chemical components of the essential oils were identified based on their retention indices (RI) based on a series of  n-alkanes, co-injection with pure compounds when available (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) or identified essential oil components, MS library search (NIST 17 and Wiley Version 10) and by comparing with the literature MS fragmentation [ 73].
3: The relative concentrations (%) of the components were calculated based on the GC peak area (FID response) without correction factors.
4: The measurements were carried out in triplicate.
