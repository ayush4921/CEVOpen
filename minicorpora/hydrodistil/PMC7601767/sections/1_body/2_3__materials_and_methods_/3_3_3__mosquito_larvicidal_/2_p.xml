<p>Fourth instar larvae of each mosquito species were used for the larvicidal assays, which were carried out as previously described [
 <xref rid="B74-plants-09-01269" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]: 250-mL beakers, 150 mL of water, and 20 larvae, aliquots of the 
 <italic>Zingiber</italic> essential oils dissolved in EtOH (1% stock solution) were added to give final concentrations of 100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6, and 3 μg/mL; EtOH only was the negative control, permethrin was the positive control, mortality was recorded after 24 and 48 h of exposure, experiments were carried out at 25 ± 2 °C, assays were carried out in quadruplicate. The larvicidal data were subjected to log-probit analysis [
