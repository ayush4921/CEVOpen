0: Fourth instar larvae of each mosquito species were used for the larvicidal assays, which were carried out as previously described [ 74]: 250-mL beakers, 150 mL of water, and 20 larvae, aliquots of the  Zingiber essential oils dissolved in EtOH (1% stock solution) were added to give final concentrations of 100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6, and 3 g/mL; EtOH only was the negative control, permethrin was the positive control, mortality was recorded after 24 and 48 h of exposure, experiments were carried out at 25  2 C, assays were carried out in quadruplicate.
1: The larvicidal data were subjected to log-probit analysis [ 75] to obtain LC 50 values, LC 90 values and 95% confidence limits using Minitab  19.2020.1 (Minitab, LLC, State College, PA, USA).
