0: Antimicrobial activity of  Zingiber essential oils was carried out on three Gram-negative organisms,  Salmonella enterica (ATCC 13076),  Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), and  Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922); three Gram-positive organisms,  Bacillus cereus (ATCC 14579),  Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 299212), and  Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923); and the pathogenic yeast,  Candida albicans (ATCC 10231), using the microbroth dilution assay as previously described [ 72].
1: Dilutions were formulated from 16,384 to 2 g/mL in sterile distilled water and pipetted into 96-well microplates.
2: Bacteria were grown in tryptic soy broth or MuellerHinton broth (double-strength), fungi were grown in Sabouraud dextrose broth (double-strength).
3: Bacteria and fungi were standardized to 5  10 5 CFU/mL for bacteria and 1  10 3 CFU/mL for the yeast.
4: The final lane, containing only serial dilutions of the essential oil without bacteria or yeast, was treated as the positive control.
5: Sterile water (no sample) and media with microorganisms were the negative controls; streptomycin was the positive antibiotic standard; cycloheximide and nystatin served as positive antifungal standards.
6: The plates were incubated at 37 C for 24 h and the minimum inhibitory concentrations were established as the well with the lowest concentration completely inhibiting microbial growth based on turbidity.
7: The IC 50 values were determined spectrophotometrically (EPOCH2C spectrophotometer, BioTeK Instruments, Inc Highland Park Winooski, VT, USA) and computed according to the following  % inhibition=ODcontrol()ODtest agentODcontrol()ODcontrol(+)100%IC50=Highconc(Highinh%50%)(HighconcLowconc)(Highinh%Lowinh%) where OD = optical density, control() = cells with medium but no antimicrobial agent, test agent is a known concentration of antimicrobial agent, control(+) = culture medium without cells, High conc/Low conc = concentration of test agent at high concentration/low concentration and High inh%/Low inh% = %inhibition at high concentration/% inhibition at low concentration).
8: The antimicrobial assays were carried out in triplicate.
