<p>Several of the essential oils from 
 <italic>Zingiber</italic> species were tested for antibacterial activity against a panel of Gram-positive (
 <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic>), and Gram-negative (
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>,

It has frequently been noted that Gram-positive bacteria demonstrate a higher susceptibility to essential oils than do Gram-negative organisms [

 <xref rid="B66-plants-09-01269" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. This phenomenon has been attributed to the existence of cell wall lipopolysaccharides in the Gram-negative bacteria, which can inhibit the hydrophobic essential oil constituents from diffusing into the cells [

 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> was also relatively sensitive to the
