<p>The essential oil with the best overall antimicrobial activity was 
 <italic>Z. nudicarpum</italic> rhizome essential oil from Pù Hoạt Nature Reserve with MIC &lt; 10 μg/mL against all three Gram-positive organisms and MIC = 16 μg/mL against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>. It is difficult to correlate essential oil composition with antimicrobial activity, however. The rhizome essential oil of 
 <italic>Z. nudicarpum</italic> was rich in α-pinene (18.7%) and β-pinene (58.3%). The antimicrobial activities of α-pinene and β-pinene have ranged from excellent to inactive against 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic>, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic>, or 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> [

 <xref rid="B71-plants-09-01269" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. However, the presence of these two compounds as major components is not enough to impart good antimicrobial activity. The leaf essential oil of 
 <italic>Z. recurvatum</italic> and the leaf and stem essential oils of 
 <italic>Z. cornubracteatum</italic> from Bến En National Park were also rich in α-pinene (16.3%, 10.1%, and 9.9%, respectively) and β-pinene (71.6%, 67.3%, and 66.8%), but these essential oils showed significantly lower antimicrobial activity. There are likely synergistic and/or antagonistic effects of minor components responsible for the activities.
