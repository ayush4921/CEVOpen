<p>The rhizome essential oils of 
 <italic>Z. cornubracteatum</italic> were predominantly composed of monoterpene hydrocarbons and oxygenated monoterpenoids. The major components were α-pinene (8.2–14.5%), β-pinene (8.8–33.1%), limonene (1.0–5.1%), 1,8-cineole (2.5–10.4%), and linalool (0.4–31.0%). Both α-pinene and β-pinene were major components in the leaf essential oils of 
 <italic>Z. cornubracteatum</italic> (2.7–10.1% and 18.8–67.3%, respectively). However, sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, including (
 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene (1.8–13.9%), germacrene D (0.7–13.7%), bicyclogermacrene (2.7–18.9%), as well as the sesquiterpenoid (
 <italic>E</italic>)-nerolidol (0.9–23.0%), were also abundant in the leaf essential oils.
