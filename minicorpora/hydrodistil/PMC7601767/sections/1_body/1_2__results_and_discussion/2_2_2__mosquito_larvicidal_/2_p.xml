<p>The essential oils showing the best larvicidal activity against 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> were 
 <italic>Z. cornubracteatum</italic> rhizome essential oil from Bến En National Park (24-h LC
 <sub>50</sub> = 17.0 μg/mL) and 
 <italic>Z. nudicarpum</italic> leaf essential oil from Pù Hoạt Nature Reserve (24-h LC
 <sub>50</sub> = 19.3 μg/mL). The rhizome essential oil of 
 <italic>Z. cornubracteatum</italic> also demonstrated remarkable activity against 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> (24-h LC
 <sub>50</sub> = 12.7 μg/mL). Both 
 <italic>Z. nudicarpum</italic> leaf essential oil and rhizome essential oil were very active against 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> larvae, with LC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 12.4 and 11.5 μg/mL, respectively.
