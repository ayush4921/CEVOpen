0: Vietnam is located in the tropics of Southeast Asia, and several mosquito-borne diseases are endemic, including Japanese encephalitis [ 1], dengue fever [ 2], and Zika [ 3].
1: Culex species are considered to be important vectors of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), including  Culex quinquefasciatus Say (Diptera: Culicidae) [ 4], but other mosquito genera may also serve as competent vectors of the virus [ 5, 6].
2: Dengue fever is hyperendemic to Vietnam with all four serotypes of the virus in circulation, resulting in periodic acute epidemics of both dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever [ 7, 8].
3: Aedes aegypti (L.) and  Aedes albopictus (Skuse) (Diptera: Culicidae) mosquitoes are the principal vectors of dengue fever virus (DFV) in Vietnam [ 9].
4: Zika virus (ZIKV) first appeared in Vietnam in 2016, where the primary transmission vector is  Aedes mosquitoes [ 10].
5: Exacerbating this problem is the increasing insecticide resistance in  Aedes [ 11, 12, 13] and  Culex mosquitoes [ 14, 15].
