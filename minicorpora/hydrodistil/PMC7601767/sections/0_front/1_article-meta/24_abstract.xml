 <p>Mosquito-borne diseases are a large problem in Vietnam as elsewhere. Due to environmental concerns regarding the use of synthetic insecticides as well as developing insecticidal resistance, there is a need for environmentally-benign alternative mosquito control agents. In addition, resistance of pathogenic microorganisms to antibiotics is an increasing problem. As part of a program to identify essential oils as alternative larvicidal and antimicrobial agents, the leaf, stem, and rhizome essential oils of several 
  <italic>Zingiber</italic> species, obtained from wild-growing specimens in northern Vietnam, were acquired by hydrodistillation and investigated using gas chromatography. The mosquito larvicidal activities of the essential oils were assessed against 
  <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic>, 
  <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>, and 
  <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, and for antibacterial activity against a selection of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and for activity against 
  <italic>Candida albicans</italic>. 
  <italic>Zingiber</italic> essential oils rich in α-pinene and β-pinene showed the best larvicidal activity. 
  <italic>Zingiber nudicarpum</italic> rhizome essential oil showed excellent antibacterial activity against 
  <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic>, 
  <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, and 
  <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic>, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 2, 8, and 1 μg/mL, respectively. However, the major components, α-pinene and β-pinene, cannot explain the antibacterial activities obtained.
