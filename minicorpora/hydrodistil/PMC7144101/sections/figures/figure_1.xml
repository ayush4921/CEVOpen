  <p>Mean BDI (± SEM) values of the essential oils from different parts of 
   <italic>M. grandiflora</italic> against 
   <italic>Ae. aegypti.</italic> All the essential oils were tested at 10 µg/cm
   <sup>2</sup> whereas DEET (
   <italic>N</italic>,
   <italic>N</italic>-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide) was tested at 25 nmol/cm
   <sup>2</sup> and ethanol a solvent control. A BDI value greater than 0 indicates biting deterrence relative to ethanol and a BDI value not significantly different from 1 shows deterrence similar to DEET.
