  <p>Mean proportion not biting values of the essential oils from different parts of

   <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>. Essential oils were tested at 10Âµg/cm
   <sup>2</sup> while DEET at 25 nmol/cm
   <sup>2</sup> was tested as a positive control. Mean proportions sharing the same letter are not significantly different.
