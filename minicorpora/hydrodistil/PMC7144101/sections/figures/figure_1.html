 <caption> Mean BDI (± SEM) values of the essential oils from different parts of M. grandiflora against Ae. aegypti. All the essential oils were tested at 10 µg/cm 2 whereas DEET ( N, N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide) was tested at 25 nmol/cm 2 and ethanol a solvent control. A BDI value greater than 0 indicates biting deterrence relative to ethanol and a BDI value not significantly different from 1 shows deterrence similar to DEET. </caption>
