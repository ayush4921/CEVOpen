 <p>In our natural products screening program for mosquitoes, we tested essential oils extracted from different plant parts of 
  <italic>Magnolia grandiflora</italic> L. for their insecticidal and biting deterrent activities against 
  <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>. Biting deterrence of seeds essential oil with biting deterrence index value of 0.89 was similar to 
  <italic>N</italic>,
  <italic>N</italic>-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide (DEET). All the other oils were active above the solvent control but the activity was significantly lower than DEET. Based on GC-MS analysis, three pure compounds that were only present in the essential oil of seed were further investigated to identify the compounds responsible for biting deterrent activity. 1-Decanol with PNB value of 0.8 was similar to DEET (PNB = 0.8), whereas 1-octanol with PNB value of 0.64 showed biting deterrence lower than 1-decanol and DEET. The activity of 1-heptanol with PNB value of 0.36 was similar to the negative control. Since 1-decanol, which was 3.3% of the seed essential oil, showed biting deterrence similar to DEET as a pure compound, this compound might be responsible for the activity of this oil. In in vitro A &amp; K bioassay, 1-decanol with MED value of 6.25 showed higher repellency than DEET (MED = 12.5). Essential oils of immature and mature fruit showed high toxicity whereas leaf, flower, and seeds essential oils gave only 20%, 0%, and 50% mortality, respectively, at the highest dose of 125 ppm. 1-Decanol with LC
  <sub>50</sub> of 4.8 ppm was the most toxic compound.
