<p>Water-distilled essential oils of the leaves, flowers, immature fruits, mature fruits, and seeds of 
 <italic>M. grandiflora</italic> were analyzed by GC-FID and GC-MS. Chemical compositions of the essential oils and total ion current (TIC) chromatogram are given in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-01359-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-01359">Figure S1 (Suplementary Material)</xref>. Chemical profiles of the oils varied among essential oils. Sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (31.5%) were dominant in the seeds and immature fruit essential oils (32%) whereas the leaf and flower oils were rich in monoterpene hydrocarbons (30.9% and 43.8%, respectively). Oxygenated monoterpenes (36.9%) were the major components of the mature fruit oil followed by monoterpene hydrocarbons (15.2%), sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (15.5%), and oxygenated sesquiterpenes (16.2%). The α- and β-pinenes and 1,8-cineole were the major contents of leaf, flower, immature fruit, and mature fruit whereas these compounds were either very low or absent in seed essential oil (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-01359-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The seed oil was differentiated from other essential oils because of the presence of fatty acid; hexadecanoic acid (2.9%) and fatty acid esters (2.2%). The saturated aliphatic esters (10.9%) and two phenolic compounds; methyl chavicol (2.6%) and eugenol (1.3%) were also only found in the seed essential oil. Major compounds, α- and β-pinenes and 1,8-cineole present in leaf, flower, immature fruit, and fruit essential oils were either in very low concentration or absent in seed essential oil (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-01359-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Fatty acids and esters (5.1%) were high and aliphatic esters (10.9%) were present only in the seed essential oil. Hexadecanoic acid (2.9%), 1-decanol (3.3%), 1-octanol (6.2%), and 1-heptanol were also present only in the seed essential oil.
