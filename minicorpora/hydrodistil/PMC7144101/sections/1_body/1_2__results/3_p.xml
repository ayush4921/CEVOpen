<p>Biting deterrence of 1-heptanol was similar to the negative control. 1-Decanol with 3.3% of seed essential oil appears to be the major compound responsible for the biting deterrent activity of the seed essential oil. In in vitro A &amp; K bioassay, MED value of 1-decanol (6.25) was lower than DEET (12.5) which indicated better repellency of 1-decanol than DEET (
