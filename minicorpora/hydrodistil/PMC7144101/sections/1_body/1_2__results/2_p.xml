<p>The essential oils obtained from five different plant parts of 
 <italic>M. grandiflora</italic> were investigated for their biting deterrent activity against 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>. All the essential oils showed biting deterrence above the negative control. Seeds essential oil produced significantly higher biting deterrence than the essential oils from the other parts (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-01359-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Seed essential oil with high minimum effective dose BDI value (0.89) showed biting deterrent activity similar to DEET whereas all the other essential oils had activity lower than DEET. 1-Decanol with PNB value of 0.8 showed biting deterrence similar to DEET (PNB = 0.8) whereas the activity of 1-octanol was above negative control but lower than DEET and 1-decanol (
