<p>Pure compounds 1-decanol, 1-octanol, and 1-heptanol, present in seed essential oil were also screened for larvicidal activity. Both 1-decanol and 1-octanol were active in screening bioassays whereas 1-heptanol did not show any mortality at the highest dose of 125 ppm. 1-Decanol and 1-octanol were further evaluated to observe the dose response. 1-Decanol with LC
 <sub>50</sub> of 4.8 ppm was the most toxic compound followed by 1-octanol (LC
 <sub>50</sub> = 34.3 ppm) at 24-h post-treatment. 1-Decanol was very toxic (LC
 <sub>50</sub> = 4.8 ppm) as a pure compound, the seed essential oil that contained 3.3% of this compound showed 50% mortality at the highest dose of 125 ppm. 1-Decanol amounted to be 4.07 ppm as a part of seed essential oil at 125 ppm which caused mortality similar to the pure compound. 1-Decanol and 1-octanol amounted to be 4.07 and 7.75 ppm, respectively, as a part of the essential oil dose of 125 ppm. Since the toxicity of 1-octanol as a pure compound was low, the main compound responsible for the toxicity of the seed essential oil appears to be 1-decanol.
