<p>The toxicity of essential oils from 
 <italic>M. grandiflora</italic> against 1-d-old larvae of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> is given in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-01359-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. In initial screening, essential oils of immature and mature fruits showed high toxicity whereas leaf, flower, and seeds essential oils gave only 20%, 0%, and 50% mortality, respectively, at the highest screening dose of 125 ppm. Therefore dose-response bioassays were not conducted on leaf, flower, and seeds essential oils. Immature fruit and mature fruit essential oils with LC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 49.4 and 48.9 ppm, respectively at 24-h post-treatment showed similar toxicity.
