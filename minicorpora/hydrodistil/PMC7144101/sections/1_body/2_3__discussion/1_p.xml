<p>Schuhly et al. [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-25-01359" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] reported β-elemene as the major compound in the fruit essential oil of 
 <italic>M. grandiflora</italic> which corroborates the finding of this study having β-elemene (6–14%) in all the essential oils of 
 <italic>M. grandiflora</italic> except seed oil. Guerra-Boone et al. [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-25-01359" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] reported bornyl acetate (20.9%) as the major compound in 
 <italic>M. grandiflora</italic> leaf oil, however, we did not detect this compound in the leaf oil. Garg and Kumar [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-25-01359" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] reported β-caryophyllene as the major compound (34.8%) in flower essential oil whereas only a small amount (1.1%) was detected in the present study. Farag and Al-Mahdy [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-25-01359" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] reported variation in the contents of 
 <italic>M. grandiflora</italic> flower oil volatiles obtained through headspace and water distillation techniques indicating the effects of the isolation technique on the yield of different compounds. Such differences in chemical compositions of essential oils are expected and can be attributed to many factors including geographic location, genetic factors, climate, crop stage, harvesting time, and processing method [
