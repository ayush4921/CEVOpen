<p>The toxicity of many natural compounds present in plant essential oils against mosquitoes has been reported in the literature. α-Pinene (LC
 <sub>50</sub> = 49.5 ppm), β-pinene (LC
 <sub>50</sub> = 35.9 ppm), β-caryophyllene (LC
 <sub>50</sub> = 26.0 ppm), and caryophyllene oxide (LC
 <sub>50</sub> = 29.8 ppm) were active as larvicides against 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> whereas 1,8-cineole did not show any mortality at the highest screening dose of 125 ppm [

 <xref rid="B23-molecules-25-01359" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Monoterpenes that were present in variable concentrations in these essential oils showed larvicidal activity. These higher percentages of monoterpenes (α- and β-pinenes) in combination with other compounds may be responsible for the high toxicity of immature- and mature fruit essential oils. We will further explore other compounds present in 
 <italic>M. grandiflora</italic> essential oils for their potential as larvicides against mosquitoes. Ethanolic extracts of sarcotesta of the seeds of 
 <italic>M. dealbata</italic> were reported to have 96.4% mortality at 0.1 mg/mL against the Mexican fruit fly (
 <italic>Anastrepha ludens</italic> Loew) whereas the extracts from the other parts were inactive [
