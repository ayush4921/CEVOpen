<p>In our previous studies, some of the compounds that were present in these essential oils exhibited very insignificant biting deterrence. α-Phellandrene (BDI = 0.52), (+)-α-pinene (BDI = 0.47), (-)-α-pinene (BDI = 0.41), (+)-β-pinene (BDI = 0.57), (-)-β-pinene (BDI = 0.51), 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (BDI = 0.48), 
 <italic>trans-</italic>sabinene hydrate (BDI = 0.61) showed biting deterrent activity lower than DEET. β-caryophyllene and caryophyllene oxide with BDI values of 0.54 and 0.66, respectively, were also significantly lower than DEET at 25 nmol/cm
 <sup>2</sup> and these two sesquiterpenes also did not repel mosquitoes up to the highest dose of 1.5 mg/cm

 <xref rid="B23-molecules-25-01359" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In our previous study, we found that mid-chain length acids (C
 <sub>10:0</sub> to C
 <sub>13:0</sub>) showed the highest biting deterrent activity against Ae. aegypti as compared to short-chain length acids (C
 <sub>6:0</sub> to C
 <sub>9:0</sub>) [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-25-01359" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The current study reveals similar pattern of medium chain length fatty alcohol (C
 <sub>10:0</sub>) had higher biting deterrent activity than short-chain length alcohol (C
 <sub>8:0</sub>). However, we shall work on this hypothesis and confirm the activity toward short, med, and long-chain fatty alcohols. Many methylbutyrates present in the seed essential oil were tested in our screening program and found not active as biting deterrents (Ali personal communications). Since most of the major compounds that were present only in seed essential oil did not show any significant activity, 1-decanol might be the main compound responsible for the biting deterrent activity of
