0: Proportion not biting (PNB) was calculated using the procedure described by Ali et al.
1: [ 22].
2: As the K & D module bioassay system can handle only four treatments along with negative and positive controls to make direct comparisons among more than four test compounds and to compensate for variation in overall response among replicates, biting deterrent activity was quantified as biting deterrence index (BDI) [ 22].
3: The BDIs were calculated using the following formula:  [BDIi,j,k]=[PNBi,j,kPNBc,j,kPNBd,j,kPNBc,j,k] where PNB i,j,k denotes the proportion of females not biting when exposed to test compound  i for replication  j and day  k ( i = 14,  j = 15,  k = 12), PNB c,j,k denotes the proportion of females not biting the solvent control  c for replication  j and day  k ( j = 15,  k = 12) and PNB d,j,k denotes the proportion of females not biting in response to DEET  d(positive control) for replication  j and day  k ( j = 15,  k = 12).
4: This formula adjusts for inter-day variation in response and incorporates information from the solvent control as well as the positive control.
