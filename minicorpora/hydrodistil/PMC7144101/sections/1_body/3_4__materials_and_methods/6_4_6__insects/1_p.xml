 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> used in these studies were from a laboratory colony maintained at the Mosquito and Fly Research Unit, Center for Medical, Agricultural and Veterinary Entomology, USDA-ARS, Gainesville, Florida since 1952. We received the eggs and stored them in our laboratory until needed. Mosquitoes were reared to the adult stage by feeding the larvae on a larval diet of 2% slurry of 3:2 beef liver powder (now Foods, Bloomingdale, Illinois) and Brewer’s yeast (Lewis Laboratories Ltd., Westport, CT, USA). The eggs were hatched and reared to the pupal stage in an environment-controlled room at a temperature of 27 °C ± 2 °C and 60 ± 10% RH in a photoperiod regimen of 12:12 (L: D) h. The adults were fed on cotton pads moistened with a 10% sucrose solution placed on the top of screens of 4-L cages.
