<p>Bioassays were conducted using Ali and Khan (A &amp; K) bioassay system developed by Ali et al. [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-25-01359" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] for quantitative evaluation of repellency against mosquitoes. Minimum effective dosage (MED) values in this bioassay were determined using a method described by Katritzky et al. [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-25-01359" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Briefly, the bioassay system consists of a 30 × 30 × 30 cm collapsible aluminum cage having one penal of clear transparent acrylic sheet with 120 × 35 mm slit through which the blood box containing a removable feeding device was attached. The top of the blood box had a sliding door used to expose the females to the treatment during the bioassay. Rectangular areas of 4 × 7.5-cm were marked on the collagen sheet that matched the measurement of the rectangular liquid reservoirs. Treatments were applied in a volume of 107 µL using a micropipette. Treated collagen was secured on the feeding reservoir containing the feeding solution using a thin layer of grease (Dow Coming Corp., Midland, MI, USA). The feeding device was then pushed inside the blood box and the sliding door was opened to expose the females to the treatment. The numbers of females landing and biting were recorded visually for 1 min. To ensure proper landing and biting, we used 3-4 cages at a time and only one treatment replication of individual compounds was completed in a single cage. The data are presented as %age biting as a function of concentration. MED is ≤ 1% biting out of 200 females in the cage. A total of five replicates were conducted.
