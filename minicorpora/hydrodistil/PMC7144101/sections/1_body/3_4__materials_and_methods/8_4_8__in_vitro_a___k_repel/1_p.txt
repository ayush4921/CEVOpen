0: Bioassays were conducted using Ali and Khan (A & K) bioassay system developed by Ali et al.
1: [ 28] for quantitative evaluation of repellency against mosquitoes.
2: Minimum effective dosage (MED) values in this bioassay were determined using a method described by Katritzky et al.
3: [ 29].
4: Briefly, the bioassay system consists of a 30  30  30 cm collapsible aluminum cage having one penal of clear transparent acrylic sheet with 120  35 mm slit through which the blood box containing a removable feeding device was attached.
5: The top of the blood box had a sliding door used to expose the females to the treatment during the bioassay.
6: Rectangular areas of 4  7.5-cm were marked on the collagen sheet that matched the measurement of the rectangular liquid reservoirs.
7: Treatments were applied in a volume of 107 L using a micropipette.
8: Treated collagen was secured on the feeding reservoir containing the feeding solution using a thin layer of grease (Dow Coming Corp., Midland, MI, USA).
9: The feeding device was then pushed inside the blood box and the sliding door was opened to expose the females to the treatment.
10: The numbers of females landing and biting were recorded visually for 1 min.
11: To ensure proper landing and biting, we used 3-4 cages at a time and only one treatment replication of individual compounds was completed in a single cage.
12: The data are presented as %age biting as a function of concentration.
13: MED is  1% biting out of 200 females in the cage.
14: A total of five replicates were conducted.
