0: The GC analysis was carried out using an Agilent 6890N GC system Agilent 5975 (SEM Ltd., Istanbul, Turkey).
1: The FID detector temperature was 300 C. To obtain the same elution order with GC-MS, simultaneous auto-injection was done on a duplicate of the same column applying the same operational conditions.
2: Relative percentage amounts of the separated compounds were calculated from FID chromatograms.
3: The analysis results are given in  Table 1.
