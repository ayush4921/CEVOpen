<p>The GC analysis was carried out using an Agilent 6890N GC system Agilent 5975 (SEM Ltd., Istanbul, Turkey). The FID detector temperature was 300 Â°C. To obtain the same elution order with GC-MS, simultaneous auto-injection was done on a duplicate of the same column applying the same operational conditions. Relative percentage amounts of the separated compounds were calculated from FID chromatograms. The analysis results are given in
