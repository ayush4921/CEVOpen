<p>The GC-MS analysis was carried out with an Agilent 5975 GC-MSD system Agilent 5975 (SEM Ltd., Istanbul, Turkey). Innowax FSC column (60 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm film thickness) was used with helium as the carrier gas (0.8 mL/min). GC oven temperature was kept at 60 °C for 10 min and programmed to 220 °C at a rate of 4 °C/min, and kept constant at 220 °C for 10 min and then programmed to 240 °C at a rate of 1 °C/min. The split ratio was adjusted at 40:1. The injector temperature was set at 250 °C. Mass spectra were recorded at 70 eV. The mass ranged from
