0: The GC-MS analysis was carried out with an Agilent 5975 GC-MSD system Agilent 5975 (SEM Ltd., Istanbul, Turkey).
1: Innowax FSC column (60 m  0.25 mm, 0.25 m film thickness) was used with helium as the carrier gas (0.8 mL/min).
2: GC oven temperature was kept at 60 C for 10 min and programmed to 220 C at a rate of 4 C/min, and kept constant at 220 C for 10 min and then programmed to 240 C at a rate of 1 C/min.
3: The split ratio was adjusted at 40:1.
4: The injector temperature was set at 250 C. Mass spectra were recorded at 70 eV.
5: The mass ranged from  m/z 35 to 450.
