0: Bioassays were conducted using the bioassay system described by Pridgeon et al.
1: [ 30] to determine the larvicidal activity of essential oils from different parts of  Magnolia grandiflora against  Ae.
2: aegypti.
3: Eggs were hatched and larvae were held overnight in the hatching cup in a temperature-controlled room maintained at a temperature of 27  2 C and 60  10% RH.
4: Five 1-day-old larvae were transferred in each of 24-well tissue culture plates in a 4050 L droplet of water.
5: Total of 50 L of larval diet (2% slurry of 3:2 beef liver powder and brewers yeast) and 1 mL of deionized water were added to each well by using a Finnpipette stepper (Thermo Fisher, Vantaa, Finland).
6: All the essential oils and pure compounds were diluted in DMSO.
7: After the treatment, the plates were swirled in clock-wise and counter-clockwise motions and front and back and side to side five times to ensure even mixing of the chemicals.
8: Larval mortality was recorded 24-h post-treatment.
9: Larvae that showed no movement in the well after manual disturbance were recorded as dead.
10: A series of 4-5 dosages were used in each treatment to get a range of mortality.
11: Treatments were replicated ten times for each extract/compound.
