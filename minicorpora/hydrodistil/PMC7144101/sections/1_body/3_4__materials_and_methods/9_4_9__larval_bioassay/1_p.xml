<p>Bioassays were conducted using the bioassay system described by Pridgeon et al. [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-25-01359" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] to determine the larvicidal activity of essential oils from different parts of 
 <italic>Magnolia grandiflora</italic> against 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>. Eggs were hatched and larvae were held overnight in the hatching cup in a temperature-controlled room maintained at a temperature of 27 ± 2 °C and 60 ± 10% RH. Five 1-day-old larvae were transferred in each of 24-well tissue culture plates in a 40–50 µL droplet of water. Total of 50 µL of larval diet (2% slurry of 3:2 beef liver powder and brewer’s yeast) and 1 mL of deionized water were added to each well by using a Finnpipette stepper (Thermo Fisher, Vantaa, Finland). All the essential oils and pure compounds were diluted in DMSO. After the treatment, the plates were swirled in clock-wise and counter-clockwise motions and front and back and side to side five times to ensure even mixing of the chemicals. Larval mortality was recorded 24-h post-treatment. Larvae that showed no movement in the well after manual disturbance were recorded as dead. A series of 4-5 dosages were used in each treatment to get a range of mortality. Treatments were replicated ten times for each extract/compound.
