0: For the extraction of essential oils, leaves, flowers, immature and mature fruits, and seeds of  M. grandiflora were separately subjected to hydrodistillation for 3 h, using a modified Clevenger-type apparatus.
1: Seeds were crushed in a mortar and pestle before hydrodistillation ( Figure 5).
2: The resultant oils were stored in glass vials at 4  0.5 C with no light.
3: The yields were calculated on a moisture-free basis for mature fruits, flowers, seeds, immature fruits and leaves at 0.02, 0.06, 0.1, 0.1, 1.5% respectively whereas there was no oil present in the stem-bark sample.
