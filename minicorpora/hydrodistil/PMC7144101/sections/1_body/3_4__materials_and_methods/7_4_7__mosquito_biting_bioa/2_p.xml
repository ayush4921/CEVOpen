<p>The temperature of the solution was maintained at 37 °C by using a circulatory bath. The test compounds and controls were randomly applied to six 4 × 3 cm marked portions of nylon organdy strip, which was positioned over the six, membrane-covered wells. A six-celled K &amp; D module containing five 6–15-day-old females per cell was positioned over the six wells, trap doors were opened and mosquitoes allowed access for 3 minutes, after which they were collected back into the module. Mosquitoes were squashed and the presence of green dye (or not) in the gut was used as an indicator of feeding. A replicate consisted of six treatments: four samples, DEET, and ethanol as solvent control. Five replicates were conducted per day using new batches of mosquitoes in each replication.</p>
