<p>Bioassays were conducted using a six-celled in vitro Klun and Debboun (K &amp; D) module bioassay system developed by Klun et al. [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-25-01359" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] for quantitative evaluation of biting deterrent properties of compounds. The K &amp; D system consists of a six-well reservoir with each of the 4 × 3 cm wells containing 6 mL of feeding solution. We used the CPDA-1 ± ATP solution instead of human blood [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-25-01359" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. CPDA-1 and ATP preparations were freshly made on the day of the test and contained a green fluorescent tracer dye (fluorescent water-based tracer “Green”; 
 <uri xlink:href="www.blacklightworld.com" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.blacklightworld.com</uri>) that allowed for the identification of mosquitoes that were fed on the solution. The squashed mosquitoes were observed under black light (FEIT, BPESL15T/BLB 13W 120VAC 60Hz 200mA, Ul#E170906) for feeding. DEET (97% purity

 <italic>N</italic>-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide) was used as a positive control (Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) and ethanol (Fisher Scientific Chemical Co. Fairlawn, NJ, USA) was used as solvent control. Stock and dilutions of all extracts and DEET were prepared in ethanol. All essential oils were evaluated at dosages of 10 µg/cm
 <sup>2</sup> and DEET along with the pure compounds was tested at a concentration of 25 nmol/cm
 <sup>2</sup>.
