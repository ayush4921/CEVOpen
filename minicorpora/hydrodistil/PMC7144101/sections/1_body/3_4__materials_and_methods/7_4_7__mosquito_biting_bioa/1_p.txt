0: Bioassays were conducted using a six-celled in vitro Klun and Debboun (K & D) module bioassay system developed by Klun et al.
1: [ 27] for quantitative evaluation of biting deterrent properties of compounds.
2: The K & D system consists of a six-well reservoir with each of the 4  3 cm wells containing 6 mL of feeding solution.
3: We used the CPDA-1  ATP solution instead of human blood [ 22].
4: CPDA-1 and ATP preparations were freshly made on the day of the test and contained a green fluorescent tracer dye (fluorescent water-based tracer Green;  www.blacklightworld.com) that allowed for the identification of mosquitoes that were fed on the solution.
5: The squashed mosquitoes were observed under black light (FEIT, BPESL15T/BLB 13W 120VAC 60Hz 200mA, Ul#E170906) for feeding.
6: DEET (97% purity  N, N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide) was used as a positive control (Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) and ethanol (Fisher Scientific Chemical Co. Fairlawn, NJ, USA) was used as solvent control.
7: Stock and dilutions of all extracts and DEET were prepared in ethanol.
8: All essential oils were evaluated at dosages of 10 g/cm 2 and DEET along with the pure compounds was tested at a concentration of 25 nmol/cm 2.
