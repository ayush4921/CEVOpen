<p>The essential oil of 
 <italic>M. grandiflora</italic> seeds exhibited biting deterrent activity activity similar to DEET. All the major compounds (concentration &gt;1%) except 1-decanol that were present only in seed essential oil were not active biting deterrents which indicated that the major activity of this essential oil might be due to 1-decanol. 1-Decanol also showed promising larvicidal activity. This high activity of 1-decanol indicated the potential of this compound to be developed as an effective mosquito population management tool. Further studies will be continued to evaluate these natural products in different formulations in large scale laboratory bioassays and field trials.
