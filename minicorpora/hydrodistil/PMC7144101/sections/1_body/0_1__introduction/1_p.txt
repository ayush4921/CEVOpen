0: Insect disease vectors transmit many disease pathogens and are important in global public health.
1: Aedes aegypti (L.) and  Ae.
2: albopictus (Skuse) are the primary and secondary vectors of Zika and dengue as well as other viruses [ 1].
3: The use of synthetic insecticides in mosquito control has proven to be one of the major approaches for the prevention and reduction of mosquito-borne disease incidence [ 2].
4: Insect repellents also play an important role in the reduction of disease incidence by preventing infected mosquitoes from biting humans [ 3].
5: Moreover; repellents have always been used against host-seeking vectors as they provide immediate; localized; personal protection.
6: N, N-Diethyl-3-methylbenzamide (DEET) has been in use for more than 60 years and is the gold standard to which all repellents are measured in the marketplace [ 4].
7: The discovery of novel insecticides and repellents against disease vectors from non-toxic and biodegradable plant sources continues to be the focus of recent research efforts [ 5, 6, 7, 8].
