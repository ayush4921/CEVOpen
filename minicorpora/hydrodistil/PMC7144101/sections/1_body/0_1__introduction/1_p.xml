<p>Insect disease vectors transmit many disease pathogens and are important in global public health. 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> (L.) and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> (Skuse) are the primary and secondary vectors of Zika and dengue as well as other viruses [

 <italic>N</italic>-Diethyl-3-methylbenzamide (DEET) has been in use for more than 60 years and is the gold standard to which all repellents are measured in the marketplace [
