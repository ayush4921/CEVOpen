0: The main bioactives contained in the essential oils were determined by means of GCMS, using an Agilent 6890 chromatograph coupled with an N-5973 mass spectrometer.
1: A capillary column (HP-5MS) with a 5% methylphenylsiloxane static phase (length 30 m, internal diameter 0.25 mm, static layer thickness 0.25 m) and ionization energy of 70 eV was used.
2: The temperature for the analyses was first set at 60 C and then increased at a rate of 3 C/min up to 246 C. The injector and detector temperatures were maintained at 250 C, the volume of the injected sample was 1 L and the helium carrier gas was maintained at a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min.
3: Identification of chemical components was based on analysis of the chromatograms obtained for each oil, by means of evaluating the retention indices (RI) in comparison with standards of n-alkane mixtures (C8C20) and the mass spectral data of each peak using a computer library (Wiley-14 and NIST-14 Mass Spectral Library), and comparison of the results with those contained in the literature 34.
