<p id="Par10">The main bioactives contained in the essential oils were determined by means of GC–MS, using an Agilent 6890 chromatograph coupled with an N-5973 mass spectrometer. A capillary column (HP-5MS) with a 5% methylphenylsiloxane static phase (length 30 m, internal diameter 0.25 mm, static layer thickness 0.25 μm) and ionization energy of 70 eV was used. The temperature for the analyses was first set at 60 °C and then increased at a rate of 3 °C/min up to 246 °C. The injector and detector temperatures were maintained at 250 °C, the volume of the injected sample was 1 µL and the helium carrier gas was maintained at a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min. Identification of chemical components was based on analysis of the chromatograms obtained for each oil, by means of evaluating the retention indices (RI) in comparison with standards of n-alkane mixtures (C8–C20) and the mass spectral data of each peak using a computer library (Wiley-14 and NIST-14 Mass Spectral Library), and comparison of the results with those contained in the literature
