<p id="Par12">This procedure was performed according to CLSI standards: 6.0 mm diameter well plates containing Müller Hinton agar were prepared and 100 µL of bacterial suspension with a half-McFarland turbidity equivalent in culture medium were cultured. The essential oils were dissolved in dimethyl-sulfoxide (DMSO) at a concentration of 30 mg/mL; 10 μL (equivalent to 300 μg) of each oil was poured into the wells. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h for bacterial strains and 48 h and 72 h at 30 °C for yeast and fungi, respectively, and antimicrobial activity was evaluated for each microorganism by measuring the diameter of the inhibition halo (in millimeters), according to an antibiogram ruler. To evaluate the repeatability of the results, three replicates were performed for each essential oil and each strain. DMSO was used as a negative control. Gentamicin (10 µg/disk) and rifampin (5 µg/disk) for bacteria and nystatin (100 I.U.) for yeast were used as standard drugs for positive control in the same conditions as tested oils.</p>
