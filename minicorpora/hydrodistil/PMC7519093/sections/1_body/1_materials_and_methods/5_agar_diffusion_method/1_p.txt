0: This procedure was performed according to CLSI standards: 6.0 mm diameter well plates containing Muller Hinton agar were prepared and 100 L of bacterial suspension with a half-McFarland turbidity equivalent in culture medium were cultured.
1: The essential oils were dissolved in dimethyl-sulfoxide (DMSO) at a concentration of 30 mg/mL; 10 L (equivalent to 300 g) of each oil was poured into the wells.
2: The plates were incubated at 37 C for 24 h for bacterial strains and 48 h and 72 h at 30 C for yeast and fungi, respectively, and antimicrobial activity was evaluated for each microorganism by measuring the diameter of the inhibition halo (in millimeters), according to an antibiogram ruler.
3: To evaluate the repeatability of the results, three replicates were performed for each essential oil and each strain.
4: DMSO was used as a negative control.
5: Gentamicin (10 g/disk) and rifampin (5 g/disk) for bacteria and nystatin (100 I.U.)
6: for yeast were used as standard drugs for positive control in the same conditions as tested oils.
