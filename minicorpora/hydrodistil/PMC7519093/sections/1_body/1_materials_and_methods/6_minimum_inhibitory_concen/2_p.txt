0: Sterile 96-well microplates were filled with 95 L of culture medium, 5 L of bacterial suspension with 0.5 McFarland dilution and 100 L of the essential oil at different concentrations.
1: Then, plates were incubated at 37 C for 24 h for bacterial strains and 48 h at 30 C for yeast.
2: The MIC was determined by means of the improvement of opacity or the change in color.
3: The MIC was the lowest concentration of an antimicrobial that inhibited visible growth (absence of turbidity).
