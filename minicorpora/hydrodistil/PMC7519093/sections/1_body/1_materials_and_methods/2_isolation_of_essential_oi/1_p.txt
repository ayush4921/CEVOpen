0: After complete drying, the samples were ground using a small electric mill.
1: Each dried plant was weighed (100 g) and subjected to the extraction process by means of water distillation using Clevenger apparatus (made in Germany) for 5 h. The essential oil was dried by anhydrous sodium sulfate and after filtration was stored in dark bottles at 4 C until use for further studies.
2: Essential oil yield was calculated based on weight percent (w/w).
3: This process was repeated three times for the oil from each plant part.
