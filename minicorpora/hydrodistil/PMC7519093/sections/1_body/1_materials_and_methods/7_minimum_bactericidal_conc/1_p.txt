0: To determine the minimum concentration able to kill the bacteria, the same microdilution method described above was used.
1: After 24 h of incubation with both bacteria and oils at different concentrations, 5 L of the content of each well was inoculated with nutrient agar medium and incubated at 37 C for 24 h for bacterial strains.
2: After incubation, the colony-forming units were enumerated.
3: The MBC was the lowest concentration able to effectively reduce the growth of microorganisms (99.5%).
