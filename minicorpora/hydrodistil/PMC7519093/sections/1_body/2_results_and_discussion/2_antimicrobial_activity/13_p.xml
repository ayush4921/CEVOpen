<p id="Par38">As reported above, the antibacterial activity of essential oils obtained from different species of 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> is mainly connected to their composition, especially oxygenated monoterpenes, which are present in high amounts

 </sup>. They act by destroying the microbial cytoplasmic wall, improving its permeability and allowing the passage of large protons and ions. However, it is difficult to attribute the antibacterial effect to a specific compound because the essential oils obtained for different species may contain different mixtures of bioactives

 </sup>. Further, due to the complexity of the composition of the essential oils, it is also difficult to explain the mechanism of action of these blends, but is important to underline that the wide variety of composition is a positive factor that may limit the development of resistance which is otherwise very common for synthetic drugs. In light of this, essential oils may represent a valid alternative to avoid the multidrug resistance of many pathogens, or they could be used in combination with antimicrobials to improve their effectiveness against different infectious diseases

 </sup>. In addition, several studies have suggested that their delivery into ad hoc formulated carriers may improve their efficacy
