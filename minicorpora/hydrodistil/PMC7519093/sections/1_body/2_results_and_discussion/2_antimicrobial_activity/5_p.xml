<p id="Par30">Essential oil from leaves or flowers of 
 <italic>S. hydrangea</italic> was also effective in inhibiting the growth of bacteria. MIC values varied from 15.63 to 2000 µg/mL as a function of the organism tested and the oil used. The lowest MIC was found against 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (15.63 μg/mL) irrespective of the oil used. This value was half that provided by rifampin (31.25 μg/mL) and double that for gentamicin (7.81 µg/mL). Moreover, these results are encouraging as in previous studies any inhibitory effect was detected by using essential oil from the aerial part of the same plant
