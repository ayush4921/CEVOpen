<p id="Par17">The leaves or flowers of 
 <italic>S. hydrangea</italic> were separately distilled by steam, resulting in two light yellow essential oils. The yield from leaves was ~ 0.25% and that from flowers was ~ 0.28%, lower than those obtained in previous studies based on extraction of the aerial parts of this plant, but it can be connected to both the species used and climatic growth conditions

 </sup>. Indeed, secondary metabolites are generally synthetized in plants as they represent the most important defense mechanisms against pathogens; the amount produced along with the quality may vary as a function of habitat, the organ in which they are produced and climate conditions

 </sup>. These differences are most likely due to differences in chemotype, which are also connected to environmental and climate conditions

 </sup>. GC/MS analyses showed that the chemical composition of essential oils was similar even though oil from leaves contained 39 components and that from flowers only 27. They represent 99.96% and 97.85% of all the compounds, respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The results obtained for flower oil are in agreement with previous studies in which the number of compounds in the aerial parts of this plant varied from 33 to 54
