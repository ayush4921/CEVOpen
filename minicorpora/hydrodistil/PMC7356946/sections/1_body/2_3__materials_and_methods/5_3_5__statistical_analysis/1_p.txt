0: The phytotoxic bioassay experiments were performed in a completely randomized design, and the experiment was repeated three times with five replicates per treatment.
1: Based on two factors, the extraction methods (two types) and the concentration (four concentrations), the data was subjected to two-way ANOVA, followed by Duncans test at the probability level of 0.05 using the CoStat software program (CoHort Software, Monterey, CA, USA).
2: According to the approach proposed by Legendre and Legendre [ 68], the data of EO chemical composition extracted by HD and MAE methods were submitted to principal component analysis (PCA), to reproduce a synthetic representation of chemical compounds.
3: PCA was performed using XLSTAT software (version 2018, Addinsoft, NY, USA).
