0: To perform the phytotoxic activity, various concentrations (250, 500, 750, and 1000 L L 1) of  T. polium and  T. decussatus EOs were prepared using 1% ( v/v) Tween 80 (Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) as an emulsifying agent.
1: In sterilized Petri plates (90 mm) lined with filter papers (Whatman No.
2: 1), 20 sterilized seeds were added and 4 mL of each concentration of the EO was poured.
3: The seeds were arranged away from each other, allowing spread within all the plates, and the plate was sealed with Parafilm  tape (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and kept at 25 C in a growth chamber with controlled conditions of light (16 h/8 h light/dark cycle).
4: Control plates were prepared as previously mentioned but using Tween 1% alone instead of EO.
5: The plates were checked daily and after six days of incubation, the germinated seeds were counted and the lengths of the root and shoot were measured [ 65].
6: The inhibition of seed germination or seedling growth was calculated as follows: (1)Inhibition =100(No/Length of controlNo/Length of treatment)No/Length of control
