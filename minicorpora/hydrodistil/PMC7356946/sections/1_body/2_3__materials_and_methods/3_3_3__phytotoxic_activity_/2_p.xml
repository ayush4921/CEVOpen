<p>To perform the phytotoxic activity, various concentrations (250, 500, 750, and 1000 µL L
 <sup>−1</sup>) of 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> and 
 <italic>T. decussatus</italic> EOs were prepared using 1% (
 <italic>v/v</italic>) Tween
 <sup>®</sup>80 (Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) as an emulsifying agent. In sterilized Petri plates (90 mm) lined with filter papers (Whatman No. 1), 20 sterilized seeds were added and 4 mL of each concentration of the EO was poured. The seeds were arranged away from each other, allowing spread within all the plates, and the plate was sealed with Parafilm
 <sup>®</sup> tape (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and kept at 25 °C in a growth chamber with controlled conditions of light (16 h/8 h light/dark cycle). Control plates were prepared as previously mentioned but using Tween 1% alone instead of EO. The plates were checked daily and after six days of incubation, the germinated seeds were counted and the lengths of the root and shoot were measured [
