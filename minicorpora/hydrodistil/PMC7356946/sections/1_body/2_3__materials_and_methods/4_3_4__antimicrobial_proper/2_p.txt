0: The EOs were individually mounted on sterile paper discs (6 mm in diameter) at a concentration of 10 L/disc.
1: Thiophenicol and treflucan were used as positive controls for antibacterial and antifungal activities at a concentration of 100 g/disc.
2: All discs were placed on plates inoculated with 1  10 6 spores mL of fungi (potato dextrose agar medium) and 1  10 8 spores mL of bacteria (nutrient agar medium).
3: Inoculated agar plates were left for 30 min at 4 C for oil diffusion; after that, the plates were incubated for 24 h at 30 C for bacteria and 72 h at 28 C for fungi.
4: The diameter of the inhibition zones was measured in millimeters, at three different points, and the average values were reported.
