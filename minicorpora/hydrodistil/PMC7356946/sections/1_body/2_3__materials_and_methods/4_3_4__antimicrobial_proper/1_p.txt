0: The extracted EOs of  T. polium and  T. decussatus were tested against a panel of pathogenic bacterial and fungal strains using agar diffusion technique, according to Prabuseenivasan, et al.
1: [ 66] and Rota, et al.
2: [ 67].
3: In detail, the EOs were extracted using the HD and MAE methods from the plants under study,  T. polium and  T. decussatus, and were tested in vitro against Gram-positive bacteria ( Bacillus subtilis ATCC6633,  Staphylococcus aureus ATCC29213), Gram-negative bacteria ( Escherichia coli ATCC25922), unicellular yeast fungi ( Candida albicans ATCC10321), and filamentous fungi ( Aspergillus niger NRC53,  Fusarium solani NRC15).
4: Bacteria and yeast strains are from the American Type Culture Collection, and fungal isolates were obtained from the culture collection of the Department of Chemistry of Natural and Microbial Products, National Research Center, Cairo, Egypt.
