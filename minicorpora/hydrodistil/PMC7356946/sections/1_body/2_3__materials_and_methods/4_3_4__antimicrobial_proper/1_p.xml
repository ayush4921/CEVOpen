<p>The extracted EOs of 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> and 
 <italic>T. decussatus</italic> were tested against a panel of pathogenic bacterial and fungal strains using agar diffusion technique, according to Prabuseenivasan, et al. [
 <xref rid="B66-plants-09-00716" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] and Rota, et al. [
 <xref rid="B67-plants-09-00716" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. In detail, the EOs were extracted using the HD and MAE methods from the plants under study, 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> and 
 <italic>T. decussatus</italic>, and were tested in vitro against Gram-positive bacteria (
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> ATCC6633, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> ATCC29213), Gram-negative bacteria (
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> ATCC25922), unicellular yeast fungi (
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> ATCC10321), and filamentous fungi (
 <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> NRC53, 
 <italic>Fusarium solani</italic> NRC15). Bacteria and yeast strains are from the American Type Culture Collection, and fungal isolates were obtained from the culture collection of the Department of Chemistry of Natural and Microbial Products, National Research Center, Cairo, Egypt.
