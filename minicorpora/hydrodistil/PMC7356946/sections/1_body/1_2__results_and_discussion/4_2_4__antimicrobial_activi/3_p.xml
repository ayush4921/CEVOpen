<p>Belmekki, et al. [
 <xref rid="B61-plants-09-00716" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] reported moderate antimicrobial activity of the EO from Algerian 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> with MIC value of 3 to 5 ÂµL/mL. Meanwhile, another study by Kerbouche, et al. [
 <xref rid="B37-plants-09-00716" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], reported a two-fold increase in the antimicrobial activity of the 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> ecospecies growing in Algeria. The reported antimicrobial activity of the EOs of 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> could be attributed to the sesquiterpenes, particularly the oxygenated compounds such as 6-epi-shyobunol, 
 <italic>t</italic>-muurolol, and germacrene D-4-ol.
