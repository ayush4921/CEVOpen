0: Agricultural and food industries produce a large amount of residues and by-products that should be valorised to accomplish the environmental challenges required by the new concepts of circular economy.
1: In particular, citrus fruits are primarily used in juice production, generating a huge amount of residues (mainly peels and pulp) that are very often discarded or burned.
2: These residues show noticeable amounts of potentially valuable chemicals, such as volatiles, pigments and essential oils (EOs), all of them located on the exocarp and flavedo of citrus peels [ 1, 2].
3: These parts of lemon fruits contain oil glands with specific terpenoids that confer the characteristic lemon fragrance.
4: It is known that EOs are volatile, soluble in organic solvents but insoluble in water at room temperature [ 3], and they can be used as flavours and aromatic ingredients in food preservatives and cosmetics or therapeutic agents in biomedical applications [ 4].
5: Besides, different terpenoids mainly present in EOs (monoterpenes such as citral, pinene, or terpinene, as well as poly(methoxyflavones) and furanocoumarins), have been used since ancient times to treat a variety of health diseases, such as spasms, fever, respiratory problems, cardiovascular diseases, gastrointestinal problems or anxiety [ 5].
6: Several works have demonstrated the antimicrobial performance of EOs against pathogenic bacteria and fungus strains [ 6, 7, 8, 9].
