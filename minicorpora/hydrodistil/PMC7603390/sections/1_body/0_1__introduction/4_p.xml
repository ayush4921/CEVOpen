<p>To the best of our knowledge, no studies have been reported dealing with the use of a cascade approach for the valorisation of lemon peels waste to extract sequentially different fractions using microwave-assisted methods, such as the EO and the pigment, and further monitoring of their antimicrobial activity. So, this work aims to investigate the extraction of (i) the EO from lemon peels by MAHD, followed by the extraction of the residual sample to obtain (ii) the lemon pigment by MAE. For the lemon pigment, MAE experimental parameters were optimised through response surface methodology (RSM) based on a Box-Behnken design (BBD) in terms of total yield and colour intensity. The obtained pigment was further purified by using adsorption resins. Finally, the main compounds present in lemon EO and pigment were determined by gas chromatography with flame ionisation detection (GC-FID) and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography–diode array detector–tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-DAD-MS), respectively. The obtained results of this study could support the comprehensive utilisation of citrus fruits waste to obtain bioactive compounds to be further applied in different industrial sectors, including food products.</p>
