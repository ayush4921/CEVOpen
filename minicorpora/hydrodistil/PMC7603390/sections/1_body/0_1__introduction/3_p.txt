0: Therefore, peels discarded from lemon juice production can be valorised to extract potentially useful compounds, such as the EO and the pigment, resulting in an economic and environmental approach, considering that up to 5065% of the whole fruit remains as peel by-product [ 14].
1: The isolation of EOs from plants or vegetable residues has been traditionally carried out by hydrodistillation (HD) or cold-press, while the pigments have been often obtained by maceration extraction [ 15].
2: Nevertheless, microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) can be used in combination with hydrodistillation (MAHD) to isolate valuable constituents from plants [ 16].
3: MAE offers some advantages over conventional extraction methods in terms of higher yield and quality of extracts.
4: In addition, the use of MAE reduces considerably the extraction time and the solvent consumption [ 17].
5: MAHD was used to obtain the EO from lemon verbena leaves, improving the selectivity of oxygenated compounds, such as citral isomers, compared to conventional HD.
6: Besides, the antioxidant and antifungal activities against nine species of fungi isolated from contaminated Feta cheese were evaluated, obtaining successful results in terms of growth inhibition [ 5].
7: Dao et al.
8: obtained a yield of 0.76 wt.% for the extraction of the EO from lemon leaves using MAHD [ 3].
