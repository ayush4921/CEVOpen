0: Citrus peels contain two types of natural pigments with differing polarities, such as lipid-soluble carotenoids and water-soluble yellow pigments, which can be a valuable natural source of colourants to replace synthetic ones, providing additional colouring to food products [ 10, 11].
1: The lemon flavedo contains carotenoids, either xanthophylls (oxygen-containing carotenoids) or carotenes (oxygen-free carotenoids) [ 12].
2: Xanthophylls are those compounds that mainly mark the typical yellow colour in lemon peels [ 13].
3: Some authors have studied, simultaneously, the phenolic and pigment composition of lemon peels while reporting their beneficial health effects [ 14].
4: Eriocitrin, a flavanone present in the flavedo and well-detected in lemon extracts (1002  65.2 mg/kg dry weight), is the main responsible for the extract colouration, together with some carotenoids [ 13].
