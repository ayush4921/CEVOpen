<p>Agricultural and food industries produce a large amount of residues and by-products that should be valorised to accomplish the environmental challenges required by the new concepts of circular economy. In particular, citrus fruits are primarily used in juice production, generating a huge amount of residues (mainly peels and pulp) that are very often discarded or burned. These residues show noticeable amounts of potentially valuable chemicals, such as volatiles, pigments and essential oils (EOs), all of them located on the exocarp and flavedo of citrus peels [

Besides, different terpenoids mainly present in EOs (monoterpenes such as citral, pinene, or terpinene, as well as poly(methoxyflavones) and furanocoumarins), have been used since ancient times to treat a variety of health diseases, such as spasms, fever, respiratory problems, cardiovascular diseases, gastrointestinal problems or anxiety [
