0: UPLC analysis of LP before and after purification was performed, in triplicate, using a Waters UPLC system coupled with a Xevo TQ-S detector (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA).
1: Twenty milligrams of LP-rich fraction were dissolved in 10 mL of MeOH:DMSO 9:1 ( v/ v) and passed through a 0.22-m poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) filter.
2: Quantification of the major polyphenolic compounds was performed based on integrated peak areas of samples and standards diluted in MeOH:DMSO 9:1 ( v/ v) using external calibration (110 mg/kg).
3: Chromatographic separation was performed with an ACQUITY UPLC Shield RP18 (100 mm  2.1 mm  1.7 m) (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA) at 40 C. The mobile phase was composed of two solvents: water containing 0.6 wt.% formic acid and 126-mg ammonium formate (A) and acetonitrile (B).
4: The linear gradient used was: 5% B (7.2 min) to 20% B (10 min) to 50% B (12 min) to 100% B.
5: The flow rate was set to 0.5 mL/min, and the injection volume was 3.5 L. Electrospray positive or negative ionisation mode was used depending on the targeted molecule.
6: Desolvation was carried out using a nitrogen gas flow (800 L/h) and high temperature (550 C).
7: Cone voltage was set at 3 kV.
8: Specific multiple reaction monitoring (MRMs), cone and collision voltage were used for each compound.
