<p>UPLC analysis of LP before and after purification was performed, in triplicate, using a Waters UPLC system coupled with a Xevo TQ-S detector (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA). Twenty milligrams of LP-rich fraction were dissolved in 10 mL of MeOH:DMSO 9:1 (

Chromatographic separation was performed with an ACQUITY UPLC Shield RP18 (100 mm × 2.1 mm × 1.7 µm) (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA) at 40 °C. The mobile phase was composed of two solvents: water containing 0.6 wt.% formic acid and 126-mg ammonium formate (A) and acetonitrile (B). The linear gradient used was: 5% B (7.2 min) to 20% B (10 min) to 50% B (12 min) to 100% B. The flow rate was set to 0.5 mL/min, and the injection volume was 3.5 μL. Electrospray positive or negative ionisation mode was used depending on the targeted molecule. Desolvation was carried out using a nitrogen gas flow (800 L/h) and high temperature (550 °C). Cone voltage was set at 3 kV. Specific multiple reaction monitoring (MRMs), cone and collision voltage were used for each compound.
