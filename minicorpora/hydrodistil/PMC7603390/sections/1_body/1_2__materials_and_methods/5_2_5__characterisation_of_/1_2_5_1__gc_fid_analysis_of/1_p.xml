<p>The analysis of the main volatile constituents present in LEO was performed, in triplicate, using a Shimadzu GC 2014 system (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) coupled to a FID detector and equipped with a RTXi-5ms column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm). The carrier gas was helium, with a flow rate of 1.25 mL/min. The oven temperature program used was: 50 °C (0.5 min) to 120 °C at 20 °C/min and then raised to 240 °C at 5 °C/min (5 min). The injector and detector temperatures were set at 285 °C and 300 °C, respectively. One microliter of LEO diluted 100× (
