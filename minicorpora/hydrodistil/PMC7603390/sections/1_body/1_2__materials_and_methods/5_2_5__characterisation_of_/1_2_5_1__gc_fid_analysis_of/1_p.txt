0: The analysis of the main volatile constituents present in LEO was performed, in triplicate, using a Shimadzu GC 2014 system (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) coupled to a FID detector and equipped with a RTXi-5ms column (30 m  0.25 mm  0.25 m).
1: The carrier gas was helium, with a flow rate of 1.25 mL/min.
2: The oven temperature program used was: 50 C (0.5 min) to 120 C at 20 C/min and then raised to 240 C at 5 C/min (5 min).
3: The injector and detector temperatures were set at 285 C and 300 C, respectively.
4: One microliter of LEO diluted 100 ( v/ v) in hexane was injected with a split ratio of 1:20.
5: The main LEO components were identified by their Kovats retention index, and their relative concentrations were obtained by peak area normalisation.
