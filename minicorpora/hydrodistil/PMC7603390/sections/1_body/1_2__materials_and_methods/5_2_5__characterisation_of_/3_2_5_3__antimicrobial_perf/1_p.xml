<p>Antimicrobial tests for LEO and LP-rich fractions were performed against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>) and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli (E. coli)</italic> as model Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, respectively. A traditional broth macrodilution method was performed, adding the LEO and LP-rich fraction at increasing concentrations to test tubes containing phosphate-buffered saline enriched with tryptic soy broth (TSB, 1 wt.%). This rich medium allowed the proliferation of the tested bacteria around two orders of magnitude in control samples. The tubes were incubated at 35 Â°C for 24 h, and then, bacteria were enumerated by plate count on tryptic soy agar (TSA). A 10% (
