0: Antimicrobial tests for LEO and LP-rich fractions were performed against  Staphylococcus aureus ( S. aureus) and  Escherichia coli (E. coli) as model Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, respectively.
1: A traditional broth macrodilution method was performed, adding the LEO and LP-rich fraction at increasing concentrations to test tubes containing phosphate-buffered saline enriched with tryptic soy broth (TSB, 1 wt.%).
2: This rich medium allowed the proliferation of the tested bacteria around two orders of magnitude in control samples.
3: The tubes were incubated at 35 C for 24 h, and then, bacteria were enumerated by plate count on tryptic soy agar (TSA).
4: A 10% ( v/ v) DMSO solution was used to improve the solubility of the studied extracts (LEO and LP-rich fraction).
