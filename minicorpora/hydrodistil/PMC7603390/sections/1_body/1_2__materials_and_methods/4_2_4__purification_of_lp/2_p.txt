0: Two grams of the LP extract were firstly dissolved in 1 L of demineralised water and loaded slowly through a glass column containing 20 g of the adsorption resin previously conditioned with water and ethanol, as recommended by the producer.
1: After the loading step (around 30 min), 1 L of water was passed through the column to ensure the complete elution of the undesired compounds (sugars, pectin, amino acids, polysaccharides, oligosaccharides, etc.).
2: Then, 250 mL of absolute ethanol (99%,  v/ v) were used for the desorption step, which consisted in the recovery of the retained metabolites (polyphenols, flavonoids, phenolic acids, etc.)
3: from the macroporous resin thanks to the solubilisation in an organic solvent, ethanol.
4: After that, the resin was washed with water and stored in 50% ( v/ v) ethanol for further use.
5: The recovered ethanol fraction was then evaporated, and the aqueous residual fraction was freeze-dried.
6: The LP-rich fraction was stored in the darkness at room temperature until further analysis.
