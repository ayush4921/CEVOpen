0: LP extracts obtained by MAE were further purified by using three different adsorption resins with different polarity: Amberlite XAD4, Amberlite XAD7HP and Amberlite XAD16N.
1: The physical properties of these resins are summarised in  Table 3.
2: The screening and selection of the best resin was evaluated based on its adsorption (retention) power of the coloured metabolites.
3: The quantification of the adsorption strength was carried out by measuring the absorbance of the extract before and after the treatment with the resins using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer at 440 nm.
