<p>LP extracts obtained by MAE were further purified by using three different adsorption resins with different polarity: Amberlite XAD4, Amberlite XAD7HP and Amberlite XAD16N. The physical properties of these resins are summarised in 
 <xref rid="foods-09-01493-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The screening and selection of the best resin was evaluated based on its adsorption (retention) power of the coloured metabolites. The quantification of the adsorption strength was carried out by measuring the absorbance of the extract before and after the treatment with the resins using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer at 440 nm.
