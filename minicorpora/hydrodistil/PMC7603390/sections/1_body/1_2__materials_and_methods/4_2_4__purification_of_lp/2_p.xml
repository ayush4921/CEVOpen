<p>Two grams of the LP extract were firstly dissolved in 1 L of demineralised water and loaded slowly through a glass column containing 20 g of the adsorption resin previously conditioned with water and ethanol, as recommended by the producer. After the loading step (around 30 min), 1 L of water was passed through the column to ensure the complete elution of the undesired compounds (sugars, pectin, amino acids, polysaccharides, oligosaccharides, etc.). Then, 250 mL of absolute ethanol (99%,

After that, the resin was washed with water and stored in 50% (
