0: Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to determine the optimal extraction conditions of LP.
1: The effects of three extraction variables (ethanol concentration, temperature and extraction time) were investigated using a Box-Behnken experimental design (BBD).
2: Table 2 shows the selected extraction variables and their levels, which were set according to the related bibliography, experimental limitations and previous tests.
3: This design consisted of 15 experiments that were performed randomly and are listed in  Table S1 ( Supplementary Materials).
4: Three central points were added to estimate the models pure error.
5: The responses obtained from the experimental design were evaluated in terms of overall extraction yield and colour intensity.
