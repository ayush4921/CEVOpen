0: For LEO, MAHD was used with a Clevenger-type apparatus.
1: Seven hundred and fifty grams of lemon waste were used for extraction at two different water-to-solid ratios (1 and 0.3 mL/g).
2: The MAHD process was divided into a first step with the sample heated near to the boiling temperature and a second step where the oil was distilled.
3: Irradiation power and extraction time conditions were selected according to previous optimisation tests, and they are shown in  Table 1.
4: The collected oil phase was centrifuged at 4000  g for 10 min to separate water and oil phases, obtaining a transparent LEO extract.
5: Extractions were performed in triplicate.
