<p>Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to determine the optimal extraction conditions of LP. The effects of three extraction variables (ethanol concentration, temperature and extraction time) were investigated using a Box-Behnken experimental design (BBD). 
 <xref rid="foods-09-01493-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> shows the selected extraction variables and their levels, which were set according to the related bibliography, experimental limitations and previous tests. This design consisted of 15 experiments that were performed randomly and are listed in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-foods-09-01493">Table S1</xref> (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-foods-09-01493">Supplementary Materials</xref>). Three central points were added to estimate the modelâ€™s pure error. The responses obtained from the experimental design were evaluated in terms of overall extraction yield and colour intensity.
