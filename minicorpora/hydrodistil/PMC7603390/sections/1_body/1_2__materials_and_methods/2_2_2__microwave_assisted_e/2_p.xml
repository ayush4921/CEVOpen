<p>For LEO, MAHD was used with a Clevenger-type apparatus. Seven hundred and fifty grams of lemon waste were used for extraction at two different water-to-solid ratios (1 and 0.3 mL/g). The MAHD process was divided into a first step with the sample heated near to the boiling temperature and a second step where the oil was distilled. Irradiation power and extraction time conditions were selected according to previous optimisation tests, and they are shown in 
 <xref rid="foods-09-01493-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The collected oil phase was centrifuged at 4000 
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min to separate water and oil phases, obtaining a transparent LEO extract. Extractions were performed in triplicate.
