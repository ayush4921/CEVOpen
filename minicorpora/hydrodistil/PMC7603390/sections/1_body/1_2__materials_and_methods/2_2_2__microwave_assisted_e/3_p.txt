0: After LEO extraction, LP was subsequently extracted without any intermediate steps.
1: Six grams of the remaining solid waste obtained after LEO hydrodistillation were introduced into a 250-mL round-bottom flask and mixed with the extraction solvent (depending on the predefined experimental conditions) at a liquid-to-solid ratio of 1:10.
2: Samples were heated in the microwave oven and extracted by controlling time and temperature for each experiment.
3: Microwave power (500 W), stirring rate (400 rpm) and heating rate (20 C/min) were kept constant during the MAE process.
4: Extracts were then filtered, and polysaccharide compounds were precipitated by adding 96% ( v/ v) ethanol.
5: Samples were kept overnight in a freezer at 20 C, and they were vacuum-filtered.
6: The ethanol present in the samples was then removed in a rotary evaporator (R-300, Buchi Labortechnik AG, Flawil, Switzerland), and the aqueous solution was freeze-dried (LyoQuest Plus, Telstar, Terrassa, Spain).
7: The obtained extract was stored in the darkness at room temperature until further analysis.
