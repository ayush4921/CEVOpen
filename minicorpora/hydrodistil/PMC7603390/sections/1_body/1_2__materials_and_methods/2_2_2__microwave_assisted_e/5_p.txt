0: A multiple linear regression analysis was performed to obtain the regression coefficients following a second-order polynomial model: (1)Y=o+iXi+iiXi2+iiXiXi where  Y is the predicted response;  X  i and  X  j are the actual values of the independent variables;    o is a constant and    i,    ii and    ij are the regression coefficients for the linear, quadratic and interactive effects of variables  i and  j, respectively.
