<p>After LEO extraction, LP was subsequently extracted without any intermediate steps. Six grams of the remaining solid waste obtained after LEO hydrodistillation were introduced into a 250-mL round-bottom flask and mixed with the extraction solvent (depending on the predefined experimental conditions) at a liquid-to-solid ratio of 1:10. Samples were heated in the microwave oven and extracted by controlling time and temperature for each experiment. Microwave power (500 W), stirring rate (400 rpm) and heating rate (20 °C/min) were kept constant during the MAE process. Extracts were then filtered, and polysaccharide compounds were precipitated by adding 96% (

The ethanol present in the samples was then removed in a rotary evaporator (R-300, Büchi Labortechnik AG, Flawil, Switzerland), and the aqueous solution was freeze-dried (LyoQuest Plus, Telstar, Terrassa, Spain). The obtained extract was stored in the darkness at room temperature until further analysis.
