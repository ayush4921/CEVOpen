<p>Lemon waste was obtained from discarded whole fruits, due to inadequate appearance or calibre, from Federación de Cooperativas Agrarias de Murcia (FECOAM, Murcia, Spain). The flavedo was mechanically peeled and slightly cut into small pieces by using a household blade cutter for 10–20 s at medium speed to reach particles of 1–50 mm
