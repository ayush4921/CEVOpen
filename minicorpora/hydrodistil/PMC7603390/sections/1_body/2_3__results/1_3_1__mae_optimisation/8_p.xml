<p>Both responses (yield and colour intensity) were positively affected by the ethanol concentration, as it is well-known that the solvent concentration is one of the most relevant factors to be considered when designing a MAE method [
 <xref rid="B22-foods-09-01493" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. A good selection of the solvent allows a good solubility of the target compounds, as well as solvent penetration, enhancing the extraction of the compounds from the matrix. In addition, the solvent selection will influence the dielectric constant and the mass transfer kinetics of the MAE process [

 <xref rid="B25-foods-09-01493" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Other authors have reported that high percentages of ethanol can break the hydrogen and hydrophobic bonds existing between phenolics–proteins and phenolics–cellulose in ethanol/water solutions, improving the extraction process [

However, some authors have demonstrated that the presence of small amounts of water in the solvent during MAE could favour a possible diffusion of water into the matrix cells, achieving a better heating and, thus, helping the transfer of compounds into the solvent at higher mass transfer rates [
