 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-09-01493-f001">Figure 1</xref> shows Pareto charts and significant effects at 95% confidence obtained for the studied responses. The extraction yield (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-09-01493-f001">Figure 1</xref>A) was significantly affected by the ethanol concentration, time and temperature (quadratic interaction), with a positive effect. Regarding colour intensity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-09-01493-f001">Figure 1</xref>B), it was positively influenced by the ethanol concentration followed by extraction temperature. Significant positive interactions between ethanol concentration-temperature and temperature-time also affected the colour intensity, increasing this response with higher values of the mentioned variables. In contrast, a significant negative interaction between ethanol concentration-time was observed, together with a negative quadratic interaction for time.
