<p>The optimal MAE conditions for LP were obtained by simultaneously maximising the extraction yield and colour intensity by using a desirability function to search a combination of the different variable levels that satisfy simultaneously all the requirements for each response [

 <italic>v</italic>) ethanol, 80 °C and 50 min. Validation tests performed under these optimal conditions, in triplicate, resulted in experimental values of 5.9 ± 0.3 wt.% for the extraction yield and 0.669 ± 0.004 for the colour intensity. These values did not differ significantly with the obtained predicted values by the models of 6.2 wt.% and 0.657 for extraction yield and colour intensity, respectively. Therefore, it was concluded that the developed quadratic models (Equations (3) and (4)) were reliable to optimise the MAE of LP extracted from lemon peels within the range of the independent variables studied.
