<p>After LEO extraction, a BBD was used to optimise the MAE of LP from the remaining solid waste consisting of 15 experiments, including three central points. The design matrix and results obtained for all experiments are given in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-foods-09-01493">Table S1</xref>. The influence of ethanol concentration, temperature and extraction time was evaluated on two response variables (extraction yield and colour intensity). These responses were selected in order to determine the final amount and colour properties of the extracted LP. Yields ranging from 3.2â€“6.2 wt.% were obtained, showing experiments 2 and 4 as the lowest and highest yields, respectively. Regarding colour intensity, the lowest and highest values were observed for experiments 2 and 13, respectively.
