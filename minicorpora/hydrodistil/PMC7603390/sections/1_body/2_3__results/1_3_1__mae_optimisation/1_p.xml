<p>A cascade extraction process from lemon waste was developed and optimised, consisting of a first extraction of the essential oil, followed by the extraction of the yellow pigment separately from the same batch in a subsequent process while achieving desirable selectivity levels and yield in both extracts. The MAE process design consisted of adding the suitable solvent for pigment extraction to the extraction vessel directly after obtaining the essential oil using MAHD, without any intermediate steps.</p>
