<p>A graphical analysis in terms of response surface plots was carried out for colour intensity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-09-01493-f002">Figure 2</xref>) to better evaluate the interactions present between the studied extraction variables on this response, giving valuable information for the analysis and optimisation of the extraction conditions [
 <xref rid="B29-foods-09-01493" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Interactions between ethanol concentration-temperature, ethanol concentration-time and temperature-time are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-09-01493-f002">Figure 2</xref>A–C, respectively. As it can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-09-01493-f002">Figure 2</xref>B,C, long extraction times are needed to obtain high response values. Regarding temperature, this variable clearly affects the response by increasing the solubility and diffusion coefficients of the target compounds and decreasing the solvent viscosity [
 <xref rid="B25-foods-09-01493" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In this sense, temperatures up to 60 °C should be applied to produce a positive effect in the response. At fixed temperature values, the time and ethanol concentration must be increased to increment the response. Moreover, a high ethanol concentration is needed to maximise the response, since a minimum amount of ethanol fraction is necessary to contribute to the destruction of cell walls, movement of the extraction solvent and diffusion inside the cells [
 <xref rid="B29-foods-09-01493" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This behaviour could be related to the change in solvent polarity with the ethanol addition and the high solubility of polyphenols in organic solvents [
