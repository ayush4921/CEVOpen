 <xref rid="foods-09-01493-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the extraction yield obtained for LEO according to the two conditions used. A higher energy was needed during the heating step when using a water-to-waste ratio of 1 mL/g due to the higher amount of water present in the extraction vessel. No significant differences were obtained in both methods, showing yield values around 2 wt.%. So, it was decided to use a water-to-waste ratio of 0.3 mL/g in terms of energy saving. Similar yield results were found by other authors but reported significantly longer extraction times. Ben Hsouna et al. reported a 3 wt.% yield for the EO extracted from flesh flowers of 
 <italic>Citrus limon</italic> by conventional HD during three h using a Clevenger-type apparatus [

Moreover, although an extraction time of 10 min was set in this work to ensure most of the essential oil was extracted, it was observed that higher than 90% of the obtained yield was extracted after four min of hydrodistillation. A similar behaviour was reported by Golmakani et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-foods-09-01493" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], who observed that increasing extraction times by MAHD did not lead to significant increases in essential oil yields from lemon peels, which were, in all cases, lower than 1.4 wt.% on a dry basis. So, the MAHD method proposed in this work offers important advantages over previous reported studies in terms of lower extraction time, being a green and rapid method to efficiently and cost-effectively extract LEO from lemon wastes.
