 <xref rid="B51-foods-09-01493" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] studied the antimicrobial activity of citrus water extracts obtained by conventional extraction methods and MAE against ten different sanitary relevant bacteria. They found that MAE extracts obtained from orange and lemon peels at 100 Â°C for 8 min significantly affected the number of strains susceptible by significantly reducing the growth rate and lag phase.
