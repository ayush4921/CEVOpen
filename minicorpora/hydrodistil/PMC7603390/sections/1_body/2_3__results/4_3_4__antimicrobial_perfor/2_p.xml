<p>Concerning LEO, the results of the antimicrobial properties at concentrations ranging from 15–5000 ppm against Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains are also shown in 
 <xref rid="foods-09-01493-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. Control samples from both bacteria were able to proliferate around two log units after 24 h of incubation, being the initial inoculum sizes of 5.72 ± 0.26 and 5.80 ± 0.01 log colony-forming units (CFU)/mL for 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli,</italic> respectively. LEO extracts showed some growth inhibition at a concentration of 50 ppm for 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, while a bacteriostatic effect was reached by using 150 ppm and 500 ppm for 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli,</italic> respectively. The death of 99.9% of the inoculated bacteria was achieved at concentrations higher than 1500 ppm in both cultures, resulting in values lower than 1 for 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and approximately 1.45 for 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. The detected antimicrobial activity confirms the efficacy of LEO as a potential natural antimicrobial source against food-borne pathogens to be applied in food systems and the pharmaceutical industry [
