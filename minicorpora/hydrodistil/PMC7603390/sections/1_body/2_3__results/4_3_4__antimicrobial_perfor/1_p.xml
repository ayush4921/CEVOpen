<p>The antimicrobial performance of the LEO and LP-rich fractions against two food-borne bacteria was assessed, and the obtained results are presented in 
 <xref rid="foods-09-01493-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. Regarding LP, no antimicrobial effect against the tested bacteria and LP concentrations was observed, even if the polyphenol compounds that could contribute to provide some antibacterial properties were already identified. These results suggested that LP might not be used as an antimicrobial additive, even at high LP concentrations. However, this extract coming from lemon wastes could be considered a natural yellow pigment to be used as a food colourant [
