<p>The results obtained in this work support previous findings linking the growth inhibition of LEO against the two studied bacteria to its polyphenolic composition (mainly limonene, p-cymene and β-pinenes). In this sense, terpenes, terpenoids and other aromatic and aliphatic constituents with low molecular weights present in LEO could interact with the lipids of the cell membrane. This interaction could improve the membrane permeability, disturbing the cell’s structure and causing homeostasis, which is known as the state of steady internal physical and chemical conditions maintained by living systems, and it results in the leakage of ions and cytoplasmic content [
