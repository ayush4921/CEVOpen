<p>The composition of LEO was investigated by GC-FID. A total of twenty-one chemical compounds were identified (
 <xref rid="foods-09-01493-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>) from the EO fractions. Six major compounds were found in LEO: α-pinene (1.992 wt.%), sabinene (2.395 wt.%), β-pinene (14.517 wt.%), myrcene (1.427 wt.%), limonene (65.082 wt.%) and γ-terpinene (9.743 wt.%). Other minor components (&lt;1 wt.%) were also identified, as shown in 
 <xref rid="foods-09-01493-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. These compounds can be quickly evaporated at room temperature due to their volatility, and they are responsible for the characteristic aroma present in LEO. The results obtained in this work are in agreement with previous chemical compositions identified by other authors [
