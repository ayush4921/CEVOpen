<p>The results obtained for the quantification of the major phenolic acids and flavonoids present in LP are summarised in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-09-01493-f005">Figure 5</xref>. As it can be seen, the major compounds found in the crude LP extract were significantly concentrated, and their purity was increased by several folds. Indeed, eriocitrin, diosmin and hesperidin present in the initial extract in a concentration of 1.096 wt.%, 1.645 wt.% and 0.529 wt.%, respectively, were enriched in the final LP-rich fraction after treatment with XAD16N resin, resulting in concentrations of 4.728 wt.%, 7.368 wt.% and 2.658 wt.%, respectively. The obtained enrichment factors for these compounds were 4.3, 4.5 and 5.0, respectively. Based on these three major components, the total LP content in the final purified fraction was around 14.7 wt.%.
