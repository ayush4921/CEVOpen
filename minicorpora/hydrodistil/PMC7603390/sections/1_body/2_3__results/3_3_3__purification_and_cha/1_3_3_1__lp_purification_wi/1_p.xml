<p>The enrichment of the LP colouring metabolites extracted by MAE was studied by using adsorption macroporous resins. These resins present some advantages compared to other separation and enrichment methods, such as their relative low cost, ease of use and the possibility to be regenerated. Besides, these resins have high efficiency, and they are suitable for industrial process scale-up [

The affinity of the targeted molecules for the macroporous resin depends on its physicochemical properties (hydrophobicity, polarity, pore diameter, surface area, particle size, etc.). The results obtained for the adsorption profile of the targeted molecules in LP by using different adsorption resins are given in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-09-01493-f003">Figure 3</xref>. As it can be seen, the minimum adsorption power/strength was found when using Amberlite XAD4 resin with an absorbance value of 0.057, corresponding to an adsorption factor of 53%, compared to the crude LP extract used as the control (absorbance of 0.108). The use of Amberlite XAD7HP resin (absorbance of 0.071) achieved an adsorption factor of 66%. Finally, the best result was found when using Amberlite XAD16N with an absorbance value of 0.08, corresponding to an adsorption factor of 74%. Based on these results, Amberlite XAD16N was selected for the fractionation experiments.
