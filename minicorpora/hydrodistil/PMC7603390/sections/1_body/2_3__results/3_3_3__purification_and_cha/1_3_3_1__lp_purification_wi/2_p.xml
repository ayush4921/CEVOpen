<p>The use of Amberlite resins has been previously reported as an efficient adsorption-desorption purification method. Ferreira-Dias et al. studied the removal of different compounds (pigments, free fatty acids and oxidation products) from olive residue oil miscella by using the same three resins applied in this work (Amberlite XAD4, XAD7HP and XAD16N), being the adsorption efficiency of every group of compounds dependent on the adsorbent and the adsorbent/oil ratio used [

 <xref rid="B42-foods-09-01493" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] used adsorption-desorption processes on Amberlite XAD7HP and Sephadex LH20 resins to partially purify anthocyanins present in the juice of red cabbage, showing the Amberlite resin had a higher adsorption capacity compared to Sephadex LH20.
