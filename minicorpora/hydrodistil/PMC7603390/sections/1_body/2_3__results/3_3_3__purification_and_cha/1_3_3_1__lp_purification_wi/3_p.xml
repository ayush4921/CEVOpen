<p>The obtained results are in good agreement with those obtained by Sandhu and Gu, who studied the adsorption/desorption properties of anthocyanins from muscadine (

 <xref rid="B43-foods-09-01493" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. These authors found that the adsorption capacity was highest on nonpolar resins (FPX-66 and XAD16N), showing XAD-7HP (polar) had the lowest adsorption capacity and ratio. This effect was attributed to strong interactions between polar hydroxy groups of anthocyanins in the solute with the adsorbent material. In addition, XAD16N has a higher surface area than XAD7HP, with values of 800 and 500 m
 <sup>2</sup>/g, respectively (

The pore size of the adsorbents and the size of adsorbate molecules also play an important role in the adsorption process, showing too-small pore diameters (such as XAD4), a restriction in the diffusion of adsorbate molecules, whereas too-large pore diameters could favour the desorption of the adsorbed molecules [
 <xref rid="B43-foods-09-01493" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. These differences in polarity, surface area and pore size could favour the adsorption of the phenolic compounds present in LP on the adsorbent phase, which contain polar hydroxyl groups and nonpolar groups, explaining the differences found in the adsorption behaviour shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-09-01493-f003">Figure 3</xref>. However, the adsorption of a solute on an adsorbent is a complex process that requires the interaction between three components: the adsorbent, the adsorbate or solute and the solvent, involving a physical action through hydrogen bonding or van der Waals forces [
