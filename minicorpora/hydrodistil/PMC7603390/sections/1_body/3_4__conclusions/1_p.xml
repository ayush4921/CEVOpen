<p>A new cascading approach to valorise lemon peels waste was successfully applied to, firstly, extract the essential oil using MAHD, obtaining a yield of 2.03% ± 0.21%. The water-to-waste ratio, energy and time used were optimised to minimise the energy consumption and promote environmentally sustainable extraction. Once the essential oil was obtained, the extraction of the pigment was optimised by MAE using a BBD design, obtaining an extract with a high content of flavonoids and a yellow colour at optimal conditions of 80% (

 <italic>v</italic>) ethanol, 80 °C and 50 min. Extraction yields of 5.9 ± 0.3 wt.% and final colour intensities of 0.669 ± 0.004 were obtained for LP. The composition of the essential oil was analysed by GC-FID, and the presences of limonene (65.082 wt.%), β-pinene (14.517 wt.%) and γ-terpinene (9.743 wt.%) were identified as characteristic compounds. The pigment was subjected to purification through adsorption resins and further analysis by UPLC-DAD-MS. The final purities of eriocitrin, diosmin and hesperidin were 4.728 wt.%, 7.368 wt.% and 2.658 wt.%, respectively, which corresponded to enrichment factors of 4.3, 7.4 and 5.0, respectively, by using Amberlite XAD16N resin. Finally, the essential oil showed strong inhibition against

 <italic>S. aureus</italic> bacteria. In conclusion, the results obtained in this work showed the potential of microwave-assisted processes to effectively valorise lemon waste as a natural source of yellow pigments and antimicrobial flavours, contributing to the circular economy. A further scale-up of the proposed cascade method would contribute to reducing the high amounts of generated lemon peels wastes while obtaining functional ingredients to be used in different important industrial sectors such as food, cosmetic, medical and biocomposites.
