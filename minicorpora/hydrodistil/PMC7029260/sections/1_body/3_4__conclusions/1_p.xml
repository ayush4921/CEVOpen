<p>The main constituent of 
 <italic>L. pubescens</italic> EO was determined as carvacrol in wild plants. The results demonstrate that the plant is a valuable natural source for carvacrol-rich EO with promising potential antimicrobial, antiobesity, and anti-AD health effects (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Our results support the use of 
 <italic>L. pubescens</italic> EO as a natural complementary treatment in TAPHM. This is the first report on the antidermatophytic, AChE inhibitory, and antiobesity effects of 
 <italic>L. pubescens</italic> EO. In conclusion, our results might be useful for further investigation aiming at clinical applications of 
 <italic>L. pubescens</italic> EO and carvacrol in the management of AD, obesity, and microbial skin infections including dermatophytosis, candidiasis, and others.
