<p>Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was performed to determine the EO composition by using the conditions reported by Ali-Shtayeh et al. [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Identification of the compounds was performed by comparing their relative retention indices (RI) with those of authentic compounds (e.g., carvacrol, terpinolene, 
 <italic>ε</italic>-caryophyllene, and 
 <italic>β</italic>-bisabolene) or by comparing their mass spectral fragmentation patterns with Wiley 7 MS library (Wiley, New York, NY, USA) and NIST98 (Gaithersburg, MD, USA) mass spectral database. The identified components along with their RI values and percentage composition are summarized in
