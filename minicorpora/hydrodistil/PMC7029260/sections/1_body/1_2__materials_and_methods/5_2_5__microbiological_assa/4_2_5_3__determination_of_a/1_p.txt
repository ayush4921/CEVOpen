0: Essential oils from  L. pubescens and carvacrol were tested for their antidermatophyte activity against four dermatophytes species:  Microsporum canis,  Trichophyton mentagrophytes,  Epidermophyton floccosum, and  Trichophyton rubrum ( Table 2) using the modified poisoned-food technique [ 28].
1: EO and carvacrol were tested at different concentrations (0.50.0039 mL/L).
2: Mycelial growth inhibition % (PI) was calculated as follows: (2)%PI=DCDTDC100,where DC is the average diameter of mycelial growth of the control, and DT is the average diameter of mycelial growth of the treatment.
3: Effective concentration fifty (EC 50) that caused 50% growth inhibition was estimated using Microsoft Excel 2010 under Windows 10.
