0: This method was used to evaluate the antimicrobial activities of the EO and carvacrol against  Candida albicans and bacterial strains as described by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) [ 23].
1: The inhibition zone diameter for each sample was measured in mm and used to calculate the antibacterial and anticandidal activity index (AI) and % of inhibition (PI) at a concentration of 1  L/disc using the following formulas [ 24]: (1)AI=mean zone of inhibition of EOzone of inhibition obtained for standard antibiotic ,PI=AI100%.
