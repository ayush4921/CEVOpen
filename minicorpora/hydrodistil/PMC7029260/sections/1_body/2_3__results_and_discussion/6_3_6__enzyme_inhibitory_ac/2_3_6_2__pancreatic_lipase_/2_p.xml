<p>In the present study, 
 <italic>L. pubescens</italic> EO and carvacrol were assessed for their activity against pancreatic lipase. The EO exhibited high inhibitory activity against PPL with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 1.08 
 <italic>μ</italic>L/mL (
 <xref rid="tab5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). The high antiobesity activity of 
 <italic>L. pubescens</italic> EO may be mainly ascribed to its high content of carvacrol which has been reported to inhibit visceral adipogenesis and adipocyte differentiation in animal cells and decrease body weight and plasma lipid levels [
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. However, carvacrol on its own cannot explain the high activity of EO, and therefore the totality of constituents of the EO may act synergistically to exert such high antiobesity activity. The higher pancreatic lipase inhibitory effects of 
 <italic>L. pubescens</italic> EO may, therefore, be attributed to its high content of bioactive phenolic acids and flavonoids acting together in a synergistic style [
