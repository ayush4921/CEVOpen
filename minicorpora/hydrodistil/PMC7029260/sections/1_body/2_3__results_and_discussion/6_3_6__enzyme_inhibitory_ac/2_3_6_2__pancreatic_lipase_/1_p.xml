<p>Pancreatic lipase, the principal enzyme associated with obesity, plays a key role in the efficient digestion of acylglycerols [
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. The hydrolysis of glycerides to glycerol and free fatty acids is performed by lipases. Taking into consideration that 50â€“70% of the total dietary fat hydrolysis is performed by pancreatic lipase, enzyme inhibition is one of the approaches used to treat obesity [
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. The mechanism involves inhibition of dietary triglyceride absorption, as this is the main source of excess calories [
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Besides, pancreatic lipase inhibition does not alter any central mechanism, which makes it an ideal approach for obesity treatment [
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. The pancreatic lipase has been widely used for the determination of the potential efficacy of natural products as antiobesity agents [
