<p>The results of this study showed that the EO and carvacrol possessed strong inhibitory activity against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> (isolated from cutaneous and vulvovaginal infections) with average PI values of 103.4% for EO and 113.6% for carvacrol (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and MIC values of 0.47 and 0.24 
 <italic>μ</italic>L/mL for EO and carvacrol, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The strong anticandidal activity of EO can, therefore, be correlated with its high content of carvacrol owing to the anticandidal activity of carvacrol which has been previously confirmed [
