<p>The MIC and EC
 <sub>50</sub> values of the EO of 
 <italic>L. pubescens</italic> on the tested dermatophytes were in the ranges of 0.08–0.16 
 <italic>μ</italic>L/mL and 0.05–0.06 
 <italic>μ</italic>L/mL, respectively. However, EO showed a fungicidal effect on the four studied dermatophytes and the MFCs were in the range of 0.16–0.25 
 <italic>μ</italic>L/mL. 
 <italic>T. mentagrophytes</italic> were more susceptible to 
 <italic>L. pubescens</italic> EO than the other tested fungi with MIC, MFC, and EC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.05, 0.08, and 0.16 
 <italic>μ</italic>L/mL, respectively.
