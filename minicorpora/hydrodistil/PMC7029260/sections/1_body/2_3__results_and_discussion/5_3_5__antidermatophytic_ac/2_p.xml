<p>The EO of 
 <italic>L. pubescens</italic> and carvacrol showed a dose-dependent activity against the tested dermatophytes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Overall, as the dose of the EO or carvacrol increased, the inhibitory activity against the tested dermatophytes increased indicated by heightened mycelial growth inhibition. The radial mycelial growth of all tested isolates was completely inhibited by the EO and carvacrol at 0.5, 0.25, and 0.125 
 <italic>μ</italic>L/mL concentration. However, at lower doses (0.004–0.063 
 <italic>μ</italic>L/mL), the EO was still more active on the mycelial growth of 
 <italic>T. mentagrophytes</italic> than other tested dermatophytes at 0.63 
 <italic>μ</italic>L/mL, PI = 89.7% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).
