<p>Aromatic plants EOs are known to be mycostatic or fungicidal and represent a potential source of new antimycotics [
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In view of the increasing resistance to the classical antimycotics, the EOs and their active constituents may be beneficial in the management of mycoses, especially dermatophytosis [
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In the present study, the 
 <italic>L. pubescens</italic> EO showed strong activity against 
 <italic>M. canis</italic>, 
 <italic>T. rubrum, T. mentagrophytes,</italic> and 
 <italic>E. floccosum</italic> as indicated by their PI, MIC, MFC, and EC
