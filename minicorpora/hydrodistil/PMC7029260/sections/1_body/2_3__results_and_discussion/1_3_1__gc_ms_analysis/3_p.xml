<p>Carvacrol is a monoterpenic phenol that is biosynthesized from 
 <italic>Î³</italic>-terpinene [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] through p-cymene [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. These two compounds are therefore present in the 
 <italic>L. pubescens</italic> EO. Biosynthetic intermediates such as terpinene-4-ol [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and p-cymen-8-ol [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] are also present [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].
