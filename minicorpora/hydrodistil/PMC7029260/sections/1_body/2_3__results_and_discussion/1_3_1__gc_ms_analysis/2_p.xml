<p>The GC-MS analysis of the EO led to the identification of 25 components (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The main identified compounds were carvacrol (65.27%),

 <italic>ε</italic>-caryophyllene (6.21%), carvacrol methyl ether (5.36%), terpinolene (5.34%), Z-
 <italic>β</italic>-ocimene (2.63%), myrcene (2.05%), para-menth-1-en-9-ol (1.73%), and caryophyllene oxide (1.11%), representing 97.13% of the total oil. Hence, the EO from the Palestinian 
 <italic>L. pubescens</italic> can be characterized as carvacrol chemotype. The oxygenated monoterpenes were the dominant (73.26%) chemical group within the constituents, followed by sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (13.84%), monoterpene hydrocarbons (11.79%), and oxygenated sesquiterpenes (1.11%). The EO chemical profile in this study is qualitatively comparable to that formerly reported from Yemen where the EO has shown to be carvacrol chemotype (60.9–77.5%) [
