<p>The antioxidant capacities of 
 <italic>L. pubescens</italic> EO may be attributed to the high content of the oil's major phenolic constituents, especially carvacrol, which were confirmed as effective antioxidant compounds with potential health benefits [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Our results demonstrate that the EOs of 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>pubescens</italic> and carvacrol have a significant strength to provide electrons to reactive oxygen species (ROS), converting them into more stable nonreactive species and ending the free ROS chain reaction.
