<p>The antioxidant activity of EOs is a biological property of great interest because the oils that possess the ability of scavenging free radicals may play an important role in the prevention of some diseases that may result from oxidative stress damages caused by the free radicals, such as brain dysfunction, Alzheimer's disease, obesity, cancer, heart disease, and immune system decline [
