<p>The strong antibacterial activity of the EO may be ascribed to the presence of high % of oxygenated monoterpenes (73.26%) such as carvacrol (65.27%), which was found to destroy cell morphology and biofilm viability in typical biofilm construction by increasing the permeability and reducing polarization of the cytoplasmic membrane [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The antibacterial activity of carvacrol has been mainly attributed to its hydrophobicity and the free hydroxyl group in its structure [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. With the appropriate hydrophobicity of carvacrol, the compound can be accumulated in the cell membrane, while its hydrogen-bonding and its proton-release abilities may induce conformational modification of the membrane resulting in cell death [
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Our results can, therefore, explain the association of the use of the LP EO in TAPHM as an antiseptic, due to the antibacterial action of carvacrol which has been previously confirmed [

 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].
