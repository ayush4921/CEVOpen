<p>Results for the in vitro antibacterial activity of 
 <italic>L. pubescens</italic> EO and carvacrol are presented in Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> as PI and MIC. The EO and carvacrol had similar high antibacterial activities against all bacteria tested with a PI range of 37.2–95.7% and MIC range of 0.2–0.7 
 <italic>μ</italic>L/mL. 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (Gram-positive) was the most susceptible strain (PI value 95.7% for EO and 87% for carvacrol). Among the tested Gram-negative bacterial strains, the EO has comparable inhibition effect with PI values 46.5, 49.8, 51.1, 51.3, and 49.6% against 
 <italic>Salmonella typhi</italic>, 
 <italic>Proteus vulgaris</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>coli</italic>, and 
 <italic>K. pneumonia</italic>, respectively.
