Upon endocardial stimulation, due to location of pacing electrode close to the apex, the excitation travelling upward from the apex to the base of ventricles was observed. While stimulating from the epicardium, when the location of the pacing-electrode on the left side of the LV was close to the base, the propagation of the excitation wave was almost parallel to the epicardial surface and of an elliptical shape, due to the fiber orientation in the LV.

Use-Dependent Effect of E. ciliata on the dV/dt<sub>max</sub> of the AP</title><p>It is typical, that the mode of action and efficacy of the antiarrhythmic preparations or local anesthetics, that slow down depolarization of the AP upstroke and inhibit Na<sup>+</sup>-channels, are highly dependent on their specific interaction with Na<sup>+</sup>-channels, depending on the channel state: open or closed, activated or inactivated. Therefore, the effectiveness of these preparations is use-dependent, and their activity in the heart may depend on stimulation rate, resting potential, and AP duration. Using the procedure to examine the use-dependent effects, i.e., changing the pacing cycle length from 400 to 200 ms, as presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-00948-f004">Figure 4</xref>, we revealed that <italic>E. ciliata</italic> (0.1 &#x003bc;L/mL) extra reduced the maximal velocity of AP upstroke at an increased pacing rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-00948-f004">Figure 4</xref>D).</p><p>In the control, an increase in the pacing rate slightly reduced both the AP amplitude and duration, and slowed the dV/dt<sub>max</sub> down by 10.7 &#x000b1; 2.1% with time constant (<bold>&#x003c4;</bold>) of 2.37 &#x000b1; 0.09 s (n = 7) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-00948-f004">Figure 4</xref>A,C).

The kinetics of the AP upstroke dV/dt<sub>max</sub> depression was evaluated with an exponential approximation of the dV/dt<sub>max</sub> changes as a function of time.

Discussion</title><p>Antiarrhythmic drug therapy is the primary treatment for heart arrhythmias, but due to the potential proarrhythmic effects of the drugs, there has been interest in development of new antiarrhythmic drugs, including herbal drugs, which may have a milder and less proarrhythmic effect [<xref rid="B17-biomolecules-10-00948" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>The majority of the antiarrhythmic drugs are blockers of various ion channels of the cardiac cells. Over 50 have years passed since Vaughan Williams created a classification of the antiarrhythmic drugs, which is still valuable and, of course, elaborated [<xref rid="B18-biomolecules-10-00948" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Certainly, in the classification blockers of different ion channels, which are also modulators of different phases of AP, are assigned to different classes of antiarrhythmic preparations. The most widely used and the biggest is the Class 1, i.e., the Na<sup>+</sup>-channels blockers, which slow the depolarization of the AP upstroke and reduce velocity of the electrical impulse propagation in the myocardium. Additionally, the Class 1, according to their action on the AP duration, was subdivided by Vaughan Williams into the three subclasses: compounds from the subclass 1A prolong the AP, 1B shorten the AP, and 1C negligibly change the AP duration. Further investigations demonstrated that the antiarrhythmic compounds of Class 1 differ according to their use-dependent effect, i.e., their inhibition of the Na<sup>+</sup>-current or dV/dt<sub>max</sub> is dependent on the time and depolarization of the cells or on the pacing rate. According to the modulated receptor hypothesis [<xref rid="B19-biomolecules-10-00948" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] this different dependence of the activity of antiarrhythmic drugs on time and membrane potential might be explained by the different interaction of those drugs with Na<sup>+</sup>-channels in their different states of activity: open or closed, and activated or inactivated. Class 1A antiarrhythmic compounds have been shown to interact better and block Na<sup>+</sup>-channels in the activated or open state which shortly last only during the AP upstroke, so their efficacy is not very dependent on the AP duration, and their interaction kinetic time constant (<bold>&#x003c4;</bold>) ranges from 1 to 10 s. Class 1B antiarrhythmic drugs highly interact and block Na<sup>+</sup>-channels in the long lasting inactivated state during entire AP, so their efficacy is remarkably dependent on the duration of AP, and the constant (<bold>&#x003c4;</bold>) of the kinetics of their interaction is less than 1 s. Meanwhile, class 1C antiarrhythmic drugs interact well and block Na<sup>+</sup>-channels in both the activated and inactivated states, so their effectiveness also depends on the APD, but their interaction is very slow, the kinetics constant (<bold>&#x003c4;</bold>) is more than 10 s [<xref rid="B14-biomolecules-10-00948" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B20-biomolecules-10-00948" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Our studies showed that the <italic>E. ciliata</italic> exerts inhibition on the dV/dt<sub>max</sub>, and blocking kinetics obtained by increased stimulation frequency of the heart had a time constant that was less than 1 s. Based on these results, it can be stated that the <italic>E. ciliata</italic> blocks the Na<sup>+</sup>-channels, inducing fast inhibition, preferably interacting with the channels in their inactivated state. In addition, the <italic>E. ciliata</italic> shortened the AP. All these data possibly enable us to state that the <italic>E. ciliata</italic> possesses features that are typical of class 1B antiarrhythmic compounds.</p><p>The <italic>E. ciliata</italic> also has other properties characteristic of Class 1 antiarrhythmic drugs, it prolongs myocardial activation time, slows the velocity down of electric impulse propagation, widens the QRS interval and shortens the QT interval. In addition, it can be noted that applying higher <italic>E. ciliata</italic> concentrations, harmonization of the impulse propagation directions (vectors) is observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-00948-f007">Figure 7</xref>), which could be one more of the assumptions of <italic>E. ciliata</italic> antiarrhythmic efficiency.</p><p>In most of our experiments, we used four concentrations of <italic>E. ciliata</italic>, from 0.01 to 0.3 &#x000b5;L/mL; all of them had a concentration dependent effect on the cardiac electrophysiological properties. The effect was observed applying all concentrations, apparently due to the <italic>E. ciliata</italic> blockade of Na<sup>+</sup>-current. Using the concentration of 0.3 &#x000b5;L/mL and when the heart was paced from the atria, impulse propagation blocks were recorded. It should be noted that when the heart is stimulated from the atria, in the impulse propagation pathway there is an A-V node, generating APs, the upstroke of which is formed, and at the same time the propagation is regulated by L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup>-current. It is possible that the <italic>E. ciliata</italic> at high concentrations inhibits not only the Na<sup>+</sup>-current, but also the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-current, and in such way slows the impulse propagation down via A-V node inducing conduction block. We demonstrated that the <italic>E. ciliata</italic> shortened the APs, but it is known that the APs duration is almost independent of Na<sup>+</sup>-current. Our research does not allow us to determine which current changes dominates in the AP shortening. The AP may be shortened due to the modulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> currents by <italic>E. ciliata</italic> [<xref rid="B21-biomolecules-10-00948" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The current generated by Na/Ca-exchange system the strength of which depends on the activity of the intracellular Na<sup>+</sup>, could be changed due to the reduction of Na<sup>+</sup>-current [<xref rid="B22-biomolecules-10-00948" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] during the action of <italic>E. ciliata</italic> and, accordingly, also might participate in regulation of the AP duration.</p><p>Summarizing it can be said that the <italic>E. ciliata</italic> possesses features of class 1B antiarrhythmic preparations and, supposedly, might be effective in the treatment of the ventricular tachycardias.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-biomolecules-10-00948"><title>5.
