<p>The 
 <italic>E. ciliata</italic> also has other properties characteristic of Class 1 antiarrhythmic drugs, it prolongs myocardial activation time, slows the velocity down of electric impulse propagation, widens the QRS interval and shortens the QT interval. In addition, it can be noted that applying higher 
 <italic>E. ciliata</italic> concentrations, harmonization of the impulse propagation directions (vectors) is observed (

 <italic>E. ciliata</italic> antiarrhythmic efficiency.
