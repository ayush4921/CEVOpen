<p>The majority of the antiarrhythmic drugs are blockers of various ion channels of the cardiac cells. Over 50 have years passed since Vaughan Williams created a classification of the antiarrhythmic drugs, which is still valuable and, of course, elaborated [
 <xref rid="B18-biomolecules-10-00948" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Certainly, in the classification blockers of different ion channels, which are also modulators of different phases of AP, are assigned to different classes of antiarrhythmic preparations. The most widely used and the biggest is the Class 1, i.e., the Na
 <sup>+</sup>-channels blockers, which slow the depolarization of the AP upstroke and reduce velocity of the electrical impulse propagation in the myocardium. Additionally, the Class 1, according to their action on the AP duration, was subdivided by Vaughan Williams into the three subclasses: compounds from the subclass 1A prolong the AP, 1B shorten the AP, and 1C negligibly change the AP duration. Further investigations demonstrated that the antiarrhythmic compounds of Class 1 differ according to their use-dependent effect, i.e., their inhibition of the Na
 <sup>+</sup>-current or dV/dt
 <sub>max</sub> is dependent on the time and depolarization of the cells or on the pacing rate. According to the modulated receptor hypothesis [
 <xref rid="B19-biomolecules-10-00948" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] this different dependence of the activity of antiarrhythmic drugs on time and membrane potential might be explained by the different interaction of those drugs with Na
 <sup>+</sup>-channels in their different states of activity: open or closed, and activated or inactivated. Class 1A antiarrhythmic compounds have been shown to interact better and block Na
 <sup>+</sup>-channels in the activated or open state which shortly last only during the AP upstroke, so their efficacy is not very dependent on the AP duration, and their interaction kinetic time constant (
 <bold>τ</bold>) ranges from 1 to 10 s. Class 1B antiarrhythmic drugs highly interact and block Na
 <sup>+</sup>-channels in the long lasting inactivated state during entire AP, so their efficacy is remarkably dependent on the duration of AP, and the constant (
 <bold>τ</bold>) of the kinetics of their interaction is less than 1 s. Meanwhile, class 1C antiarrhythmic drugs interact well and block Na
 <sup>+</sup>-channels in both the activated and inactivated states, so their effectiveness also depends on the APD, but their interaction is very slow, the kinetics constant (
 <bold>τ</bold>) is more than 10 s [
