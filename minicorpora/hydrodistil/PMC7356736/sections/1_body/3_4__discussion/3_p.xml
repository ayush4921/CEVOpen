<p>Our studies showed that the 
 <italic>E. ciliata</italic> exerts inhibition on the dV/dt
 <sub>max</sub>, and blocking kinetics obtained by increased stimulation frequency of the heart had a time constant that was less than 1 s. Based on these results, it can be stated that the 
 <italic>E. ciliata</italic> blocks the Na
 <sup>+</sup>-channels, inducing fast inhibition, preferably interacting with the channels in their inactivated state. In addition, the 
 <italic>E. ciliata</italic> shortened the AP. All these data possibly enable us to state that the 
 <italic>E. ciliata</italic> possesses features that are typical of class 1B antiarrhythmic compounds.
