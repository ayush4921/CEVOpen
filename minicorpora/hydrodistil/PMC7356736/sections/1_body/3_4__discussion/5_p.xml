<p>In most of our experiments, we used four concentrations of 
 <italic>E. ciliata</italic>, from 0.01 to 0.3 µL/mL; all of them had a concentration dependent effect on the cardiac electrophysiological properties. The effect was observed applying all concentrations, apparently due to the 
 <italic>E. ciliata</italic> blockade of Na
 <sup>+</sup>-current. Using the concentration of 0.3 µL/mL and when the heart was paced from the atria, impulse propagation blocks were recorded. It should be noted that when the heart is stimulated from the atria, in the impulse propagation pathway there is an A-V node, generating APs, the upstroke of which is formed, and at the same time the propagation is regulated by L-type Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>-current. It is possible that the 
 <italic>E. ciliata</italic> at high concentrations inhibits not only the Na
 <sup>+</sup>-current, but also the Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>-current, and in such way slows the impulse propagation down via A-V node inducing conduction block. We demonstrated that the 
 <italic>E. ciliata</italic> shortened the APs, but it is known that the APs duration is almost independent of Na
 <sup>+</sup>-current. Our research does not allow us to determine which current changes dominates in the AP shortening. The AP may be shortened due to the modulation of Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> and K
 <sup>+</sup> currents by 
 <italic>E. ciliata</italic> [
 <xref rid="B21-biomolecules-10-00948" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The current generated by Na/Ca-exchange system the strength of which depends on the activity of the intracellular Na
 <sup>+</sup>, could be changed due to the reduction of Na
 <sup>+</sup>-current [
 <xref rid="B22-biomolecules-10-00948" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] during the action of 
 <italic>E. ciliata</italic> and, accordingly, also might participate in regulation of the AP duration.
