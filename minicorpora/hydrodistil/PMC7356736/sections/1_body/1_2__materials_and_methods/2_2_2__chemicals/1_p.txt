0: All other reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich (Schnelldorf, Germany), excluding near infrared (NIR) voltage-sensitive dye (VSD), di-4-ANBDQBS (JPW6033) (AAT Bioquest, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) and () blebbistatin (Cayman, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA).
1: Water insoluble compounds were initially dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or ethanol to make stock solutions, which were then diluted.
2: A stock solution of  E. ciliata (1:1 in ethyl alcohol, anhydrous, 99.8%) was freshly prepared prior to each experiment and diluted to various concentrations (0.010.3 L/mL) with Tyrode solution just before use.
3: The highest concentration of the solvent was<0.1%, and the solvent did not affect the measurements [ 12].
