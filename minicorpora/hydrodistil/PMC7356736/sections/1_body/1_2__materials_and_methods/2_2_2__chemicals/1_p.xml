<p>All other reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich (Schnelldorf, Germany), excluding near infrared (NIR) voltage-sensitive dye (VSD), di-4-ANBDQBS (JPW6033) (AAT Bioquest, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) and (±) blebbistatin (Cayman, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA). Water insoluble compounds were initially dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or ethanol to make stock solutions, which were then diluted. A stock solution of 
 <italic>E. ciliata</italic> (1:1 in ethyl alcohol, anhydrous, ≥99.8%) was freshly prepared prior to each experiment and diluted to various concentrations (0.01–0.3 µL/mL) with Tyrode solution just before use. The highest concentration of the solvent was &lt;0.1%, and the solvent did not affect the measurements [
