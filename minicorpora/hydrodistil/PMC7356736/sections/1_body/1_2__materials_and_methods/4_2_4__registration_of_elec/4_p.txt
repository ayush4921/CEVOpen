0: Optical-APs (OAPs) were obtained using NIR VSD, di-4-ANBDQBS.
1: The dye was excited with collimated light using a 660 nm LED (M660L3, filtered at 650/40; from Thorlabs, Newton, New Jersey, USA).
2: The emitted fluorescence was filtered by a 720 nm long pass filter (NT46-066, Edmund Optics, Barrington, New Jersey, USA), which was placed in front of the camera.
3: Optical movies were obtained with a fast (500 frames per second, and 128   128 pixels), 14 bit EMCCD camera (iXon EM+DU 860, Andor Technology Ltd, Belfast, Northern Ireland, UK).
4: The anterior surface of the heart was imaged (captured LV, RV and the interventricular groove), the field of view was 20   20 mm.
5: The OAPs were taken from an area of 5   5 pixels.
6: The background fluorescence (F) was subtracted from every frame of the recording.
7: The optical signal was normalized with respect to the background fluorescence to obtain the voltage dependent fractional change in the fluorescence signal (F/F).
