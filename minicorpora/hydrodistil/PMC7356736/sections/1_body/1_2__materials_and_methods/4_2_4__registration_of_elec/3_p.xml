<p>Use-dependent effect of 
 <italic>E. ciliata</italic> was detected from the decrease in AP upstroke velocity (dV/dt
 <sub>max</sub>) [
 <xref rid="B14-biomolecules-10-00948" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], when stimulation rate was switched from 2.5 Hz to 5 Hz. The kinetics of attenuation of dV/dt
 <sub>max</sub> was determined by fitting the dV/dt
 <sub>max</sub> decrease in time with an exponential decay function. The time constant (
 <italic>Ï„</italic>) of block development was expressed by time necessary to achieve 63.2% of the maximal steady-state decrease of dV/dt
 <sub>max</sub>.
