0: Use-dependent effect of  E. ciliata was detected from the decrease in AP upstroke velocity (dV/dt max) [ 14], when stimulation rate was switched from 2.5 Hz to 5 Hz.
1: The kinetics of attenuation of dV/dt max was determined by fitting the dV/dt max decrease in time with an exponential decay function.
2: The time constant ( ) of block development was expressed by time necessary to achieve 63.2% of the maximal steady-state decrease of dV/dt max.
