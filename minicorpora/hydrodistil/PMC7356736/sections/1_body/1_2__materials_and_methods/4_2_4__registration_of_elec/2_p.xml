<p>Microelectrode-APs were recorded using glass microelectrodes (filled with 3 M KCl), which were inserted in the left and right ventricular (LV and RV) walls from the epicardial surface. The recorded APs were amplified and digitized by the 16 channel PowerLab system (ADInstruments, Oxford, UK) at a frequency of 20 kHz.</p>
