<p>A pseudo electrocardiogram (pseudo ECG) was recorded via two electrodes placed on the posterior surface of the heart at a distance of about 10 mm, using LabChart8 Pro software (ADInstruments, Oxford, UK). Simultaneously, the electrical activities registered with microelectrodes and with NIR VSD were obtained from the anterior surface of the heart.</p>
