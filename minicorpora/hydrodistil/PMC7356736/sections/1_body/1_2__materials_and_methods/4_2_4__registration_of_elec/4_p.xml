<p>Optical-APs (OAPs) were obtained using NIR VSD, di-4-ANBDQBS. The dye was excited with collimated light using a 660 nm LED (M660L3, filtered at 650/40; from Thorlabs, Newton, New Jersey, USA). The emitted fluorescence was filtered by a 720 nm long pass filter (NT46-066, Edmund Optics, Barrington, New Jersey, USA), which was placed in front of the camera. Optical movies were obtained with a fast (500 frames per second, and 128

 <sup>EM</sup>+DU 860, Andor Technology Ltd, Belfast, Northern Ireland, UK). The anterior surface of the heart was imaged (captured LV, RV and the interventricular groove), the field of view was 20
