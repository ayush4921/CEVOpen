<p>The essential oil from 
 <italic>E. ciliata</italic> dried herb (purchased from “Žolynų namai“, Vilnius, Lithuania; a voucher specimen #L 17710) was prepared using a Clevenger distillation apparatus. A sample of dried grounded herb (30 g) was mixed with 500 mL purified water and submitted to extraction for 4 h at 120 °C [
