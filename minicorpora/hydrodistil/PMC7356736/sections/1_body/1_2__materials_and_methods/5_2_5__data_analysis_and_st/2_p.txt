0: The activation time (AT) was detected as the time interval from stimulus to dV/dt max of AP upstroke or 50% depolarization of the OAP.
1: OAP upstroke duration was calculated between 20 and 80% of depolarization (UD20-80).
2: Conduction velocity and conduction vector maps were constructed from AT data using Scroll 1.16 software.
3: The duration of the AP and OAP (APD and OAPD) was detected at the level of 20%, 50%, and 90% repolarization, calculated from their AT.
4: The OAP maps were constructed using custom Scroll 1.16 software developed by Dr. S. Mironov (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA).
