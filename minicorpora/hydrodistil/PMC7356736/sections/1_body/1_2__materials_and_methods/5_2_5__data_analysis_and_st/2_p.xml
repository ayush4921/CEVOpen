<p>The activation time (AT) was detected as the time interval from stimulus to dV/dt
 <sub>max</sub> of AP upstroke or 50% depolarization of the OAP. OAP upstroke duration was calculated between 20 and 80% of depolarization (UD20-80). Conduction velocity and conduction vector maps were constructed from AT data using Scroll 1.16 software. The duration of the AP and OAP (APD and OAPD) was detected at the level of 20%, 50%, and 90% repolarization, calculated from their AT. The OAP maps were constructed using custom Scroll 1.16 software developed by Dr. S. Mironov (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA).
