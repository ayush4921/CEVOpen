<p>Time-to-R
 <sub>max</sub> was detected as time to maximal amplitude to the R-peak from the stimulus. Changes in QRS and QT intervals were automatically recorded and calculated using LabChart8 Pro software ECG analysis for rabbit heart. QRS and QT intervals were taken as the time interval from Q wave to the S wave or 0.5 of T wave decay, respectively.
