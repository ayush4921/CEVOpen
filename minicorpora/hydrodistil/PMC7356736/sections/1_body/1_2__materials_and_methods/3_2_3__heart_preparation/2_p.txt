0: New Zealand white rabbits (n = 11) of either sex (~3.5 kg) were used in the study.
1: The excised hearts were cannulated via its aorta and swiftly connected to a Langendorff system [ 12].
2: Hearts were perfused retrogradely at constant pressure (80 mmHg) for 30 min with oxygenated (100% O 2) Tyrode solution (in mM/L: 135 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 1.8 CaCl 2, 0.9 MgCl 2, 0.33 NaH 2PO 4, 10 glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.4 at 37  0.5 C).
3: Then the perfusion was switched to a recirculation mode and blebbistatin (10 M/L) was added to inhibit contraction, in order to eliminate heart movement during recordings of the action potentials (APs).
4: After stabilization, the hearts were stained with NIR VSD, di-4-ANBDQBS, which was added into the perfusate at a final concentration of 3 M/L.
5: Then  E. ciliata was added to the perfusate to obtain the final concentrations of 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, and 0.3 (L/mL) (recalculated as percent concentrations: 0.001%, 0.003%, 0.01%, and 0.03%, respectively).
6: Recordings were obtained after 10 min exposure to each cumulatively added  E. ciliata concentration.
