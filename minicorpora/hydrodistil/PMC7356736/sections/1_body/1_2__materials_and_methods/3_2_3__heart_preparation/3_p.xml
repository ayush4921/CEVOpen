<p>Atrial and epicardial pacing was performed via bipolar hook electrodes embedded in the atrium and epicardial surface of left ventricle (near the base), respectively. Endocardial pacing was performed via a bipolar silver electrode inserted into the left ventricular cavity close to the apex. The heart was continuously electrically stimulated for a 300 ms period, with a 2 ms pulse width set at twice the threshold. When pacing was initiated via atrial/endo-/epi-cardial surfaces, the spread of electrical activity varied, creating different situations in the myocardium [
