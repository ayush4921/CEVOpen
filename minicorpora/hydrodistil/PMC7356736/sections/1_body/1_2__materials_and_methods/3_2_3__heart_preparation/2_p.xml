<p>New Zealand white rabbits (n = 11) of either sex (~3.5 kg) were used in the study. The excised hearts were cannulated via its aorta and swiftly connected to a Langendorff system [

Then the perfusion was switched to a recirculation mode and blebbistatin (10 μM/L) was added to inhibit contraction, in order to eliminate heart movement during recordings of the action potentials (APs). After stabilization, the hearts were stained with NIR VSD, di-4-ANBDQBS, which was added into the perfusate at a final concentration of 3 µM/L. Then
