<p>This study provides the first characterization of the effects of the 
 <italic>E. ciliata</italic> essential oil in a Langendorff-perfused heart model for the registration of cardiac electrical activity. 
 <italic>E. ciliata</italic> increased QRS duration, shortened the QT interval of pseudo ECG, and reduced the action potential upstroke dV/dt
 <sub>ma</sub>, and the duration. A marked attenuation of the AP dV/dt
 <sub>max</sub> and slowing down of the spread of electrical signals suggested an impaired functioning of the Na
 <sup>+</sup>-channels, and the effect was use-dependent. Our results demonstrate that 
 <italic>E. ciliata</italic> possesses features of class 1B antiarrhythmic preparations and, supposedly, might be effective in the treatment of the ventricular tachycardias.
