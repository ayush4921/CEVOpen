0: In the present study, using the Langendorff-perfused rabbit heart model, we studied effects of  E. ciliata on the cardiac surface ECG and action potentials (APs) during atrial, endo- and epi-cardial stimulation.
1: In particular, we tested how the effects of  E. ciliata relate with the first-class antiarrhythmic drug features.
2: Our study is the first to examine the role of  E. ciliata in modulation of cardiac electrical activity and to link these cellular mechanisms to the properties typical for the first-class antiarrhythmic drugs.
