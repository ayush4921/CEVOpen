<p>Initially, a chemical composition of 
 <italic>E. ciliata</italic> prepared by different extraction methods from fresh/frozen/dried herbal materials has been described: a total of 48 compounds were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method [
 <xref rid="B5-biomolecules-10-00948" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The major compounds of this essential oil were dehydroelsholzia ketone (78.28%) and elsholtzia ketone (14.58%) (

 <xref rid="B7-biomolecules-10-00948" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-biomolecules-10-00948" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], with the main component dehydroelsholtsia ketone, which was first isolated from this source in 1997, and for which a structure of 3-methyl-2-(3-methylbut-2-enoyl)furan was suggested [

 <italic>E. ciliata</italic> herb could vary because of environmental factors and different growing places [
