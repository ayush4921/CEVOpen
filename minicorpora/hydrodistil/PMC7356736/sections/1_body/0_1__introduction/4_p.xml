<p>Recently, the 
 <italic>E. ciliata</italic> has been internationally patented by Bernatoniene et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-biomolecules-10-00948" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] as having antiarrhythmic properties characteristic to the first-class antiarrhythmic drugs. However, a detailed mechanism of 
 <italic>E. ciliata</italic> action in the heart with tissue architecture and properties remaining intact and thus allowing a comprehensive analysis of cardiac electrophysiology in (nearly an) in vivo setting has not been described. The clinically relevant concentrations of the compound remain unclear in terms of safety of use and efficacy of cardioprotection, because many medicines, including essential oil accumulating herbal materials, have side effects at high concentrations.
