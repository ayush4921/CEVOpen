<p>In the present study, using the Langendorff-perfused rabbit heart model, we studied effects of 
 <italic>E. ciliata</italic> on the cardiac surface ECG and action potentials (APs) during atrial, endo- and epi-cardial stimulation. In particular, we tested how the effects of 
 <italic>E. ciliata</italic> relate with the first-class antiarrhythmic drug features. Our study is the first to examine the role of 
 <italic>E. ciliata</italic> in modulation of cardiac electrical activity and to link these cellular mechanisms to the properties typical for the first-class antiarrhythmic drugs.
