0: Antiarrhythmic drugs are of particular importance, but many of them are discarded due to side effects [ 1, 2].
1: Therefore, the discovery of new ones is of particular importance.
2: Voltage-gated Na +-channels play an important role in the initiation and conduction of cardiac electrical signals; therefore, selective inhibition of Na + conductance could be a promising antiarrhythmic target [ 3, 4].
