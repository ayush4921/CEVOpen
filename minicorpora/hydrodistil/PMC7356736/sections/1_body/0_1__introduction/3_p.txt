0: Initially, a chemical composition of  E. ciliata prepared by different extraction methods from fresh/frozen/dried herbal materials has been described: a total of 48 compounds were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method [ 5].
1: The major compounds of this essential oil were dehydroelsholzia ketone (78.28%) and elsholtzia ketone (14.58%) ( Supplementary Materials Table S1).
2: The composition of this essential oil was similar to that reported by other groups [ 6, 7, 8], with the main component dehydroelsholtsia ketone, which was first isolated from this source in 1997, and for which a structure of 3-methyl-2-(3-methylbut-2-enoyl)furan was suggested [ 9].
3: Chemical composition of  E. ciliata herb could vary because of environmental factors and different growing places [ 10].
4: Furthermore, an anticancer activity of the  E. ciliata on human glioblastoma (U87), pancreatic cancer (Panc-1) and triple negative breast cancer (MDA-MB231) cell lines has been demonstrated in vitro [ 5].
