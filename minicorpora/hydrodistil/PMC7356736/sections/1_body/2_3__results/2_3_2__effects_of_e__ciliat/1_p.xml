<p>It is commonly known that QRS express propagation features of the electrical signal in the heart, and QT interval reflects the AP duration [

 <xref rid="B16-biomolecules-10-00948" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The QRS and QT intervals can be used to evaluate the conduction velocity and APD, respectively. The data presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-00948-f002">Figure 2</xref>A,B show that APs, obtained with standard glass microelectrodes inserted in the LV wall from the epicardial surface of the rabbit heart, follows the changes in the pseudo ECGs depending on the modifications due to the 
 <italic>E. ciliata</italic>. APs were recorded during stimulation from both endo- and epi-cardial surfaces of ventricles, and when pacing was applied from the atrium. During atrial stimulation, as described previously by Macianskiene et al. [
 <xref rid="B13-biomolecules-10-00948" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], the spread of electrical excitation reaches the Purkinje fibers first, therefore activation of the entire endocardium of the ventricles occurs almost simultaneously. Further, the electrical wave propagates transmurally from the endocardium-to-epicardium. Upon endocardial stimulation, due to location of pacing electrode close to the apex, the excitation travelling upward from the apex to the base of ventricles was observed. While stimulating from the epicardium, when the location of the pacing-electrode on the left side of the LV was close to the base, the propagation of the excitation wave was almost parallel to the epicardial surface and of an elliptical shape, due to the fiber orientation in the LV. In this study, effects of 
 <italic>E. ciliata</italic> were investigated using all three pacing types.
