 <sub>max</sub>) showing a dose-dependent inhibition with 
 <italic>E. ciliata</italic>, when the heart was stimulated from epicardium. All concentrations of 
 <italic>E. ciliata</italic> decreased the amplitude of dV/dt
 <sub>max</sub>, suggesting inhibition of Na
 <sup>+</sup>-channels, and caused an increase in the activation time (AT).
