 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-biomolecules-10-00948">Supplementary Materials Table S2</xref>, under control conditions, the AT was longest during stimulation from the atrium, possibly due to the slow excitation propagation via the atrioventricular (A-V) node where AP are generated by L-type Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>-current. While upon the action of 
 <italic>E. ciliata</italic>, the activation time (AT) increased at all pacing types. However, when the heart was stimulated from the atrium, the effect on the AT using a 0.3 µL/mL concentration of the 
 <italic>E. ciliata</italic> was much bigger, possibly, because of inhibition of the L-type Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>-current. As a consequence, the electrical excitation propagation via the A-V node slowed down. Besides, in all experiments the A-V blocks were caused after &gt;5 min, when 0.3 µL/mL concentration of the 
 <italic>E. ciliata</italic> was applied.
