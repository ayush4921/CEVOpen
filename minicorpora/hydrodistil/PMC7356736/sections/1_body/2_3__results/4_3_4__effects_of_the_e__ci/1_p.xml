<p>The data above show that the 
 <italic>E. ciliata</italic> caused concentration-dependent modification of both pseudo ECG (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-00948-f002">Figure 2</xref>). To extend our observations, we evaluated effects of the 
 <italic>E. ciliata</italic> on the optically recorded APs (OAPs) using a NIR VSD, di-4-ANDBQBS, on the rabbit hearts. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-00948-f005">Figure 5</xref>Aâ€“C shows typical examples of overlapped OAP recordings obtained during atrial/endo-/epi-cardial stimulation. Data show that the activation time of the OAPs and their shape, similarly as with the microelectrode-recorded electrical APs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-00948-f002">Figure 2</xref>), change upon action of the 
 <italic>E. ciliata</italic> of the increasing concentrations.
