 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-00948-f006">Figure 6</xref> shows summary data of the concentration-dependent changes of OAP activation time, the voltage-sensitive fraction of fluorescence, OAP upstroke duration, and OAP duration after application of the 
 <italic>E. ciliata</italic> (0.01–0.3 μL/mL) under different pacing types (atrial/endo-/epi-cardial). Also, the mean values of OAP parameters, obtained under three pacing types, are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-biomolecules-10-00948">Supplementary Materials Table S3</xref>. These data demonstrate that independently of the registration technique, using the standard microelectrodes, as presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-00948-f002">Figure 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-00948-f003">Figure 3</xref>, or the optical mapping, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-00948-f005">Figure 5</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-00948-f006">Figure 6</xref>, the 
 <italic>E. ciliata</italic> increased the AT (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-00948-f003">Figure 3</xref>A and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-00948-f006">Figure 6</xref>A), slowed the depolarization of the AP upstroke down (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-00948-f003">Figure 3</xref>B and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-00948-f006">Figure 6</xref>C), and shortened the time of the electrical excitation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-00948-f003">Figure 3</xref>C and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-00948-f006">Figure 6</xref>D). Besides, the data show that 
 <italic>E. ciliata</italic> in a concentration-dependent manner reduced the voltage-sensitive fraction of fluorescence (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-00948-f006">Figure 6</xref>B). That effect, at least partly, could be explained by the lowered amplitude of the AP (see 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-biomolecules-10-00948">Supplementary Materials Table S3</xref>) because of a possible blocking action of the 
 <italic>E. ciliata</italic> on the Na
 <sup>+</sup> and Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> currents. Reduction of ΔF/F also might happen because of summation of OAPs from many cells located at different depth and spatially, which amplitudes are separated in time.
