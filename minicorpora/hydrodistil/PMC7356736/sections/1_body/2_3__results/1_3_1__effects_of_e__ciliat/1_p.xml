<p>To demonstrate how 
 <italic>E. ciliata</italic> changes electrical activity, we applied it on the isolated perfused rabbit heart. The effect of that herbal preparation was investigated by recording pseudo ECG from the posterior surface of epicardium. Typical examples of pseudo ECGs, as presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-00948-f001">Figure 1</xref>A, were obtained after perfusion with the Tyrode solution (control) followed by a 10 min perfusion with each of 0.01, 0.03, 0.1 and 0.3 ÂµL/mL concentrations of the 
 <italic>E. ciliata</italic>, and a washout period (~20 min), when stimulated from the epicardial surface with a period of 300 ms.
