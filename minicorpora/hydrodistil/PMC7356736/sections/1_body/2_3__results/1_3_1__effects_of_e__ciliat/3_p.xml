<p>Our results revealed that 
 <italic>E. ciliata</italic> in a concentration-dependent manner lengthens both the time-to-R
 <sub>max</sub> and the QRS duration, while shortening the QT interval. The low concentrations of 
 <italic>E. ciliata</italic> (≤0.1 µL/mL) only moderately affected the time-to-R
 <sub>max</sub>, QRS, and QT interval, but the effects were statistically significant (n = 5, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Of note, an abrupt increase, as presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-00948-f001">Figure 1</xref>C, was detected when applying 
 <italic>E. ciliata</italic> concentrations equal or higher (not illustrated) than 0.3 µL/mL. In addition, atrioventricular (A-V) blocks were observed when using 0.3 µL/mL concentration. Action of the 
 <italic>E. ciliata</italic> on the pseudo ECG was at least partially reversible upon washout with normal Tyrode solution. The mean values of pseudo ECG parameters obtained with increasing 
 <italic>E. ciliata</italic> concentrations are presented in
