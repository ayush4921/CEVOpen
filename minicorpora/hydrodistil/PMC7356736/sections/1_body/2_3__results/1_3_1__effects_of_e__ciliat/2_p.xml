 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-00948-f001">Figure 1</xref>B shows real-time recordings, from the same experiment as in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-00948-f001">Figure 1</xref>A, during progressive change in pseudo ECG signals, with the modification by four 
 <italic>E. ciliata</italic> concentrations (as indicated). Pseudo ECG records were converted to “pseudo-colors” and overlaid onto the color 3D image of views from both top and bottom, as presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-00948-f001">Figure 1</xref>B (upper and lower panels, respectively). Notice the transient changes on surface pseudo ECG recordings, from front (white arrow) to back, associated with the QRS widening and QT interval shortening resulting from the addition of 
 <italic>E. ciliata</italic>, and the recovery upon washout.
