<p>The representative maps of electrical activity recorded on the whole heart during epicardial stimulation (300 ms period) using the optical mapping demonstrate how the activation time, conduction velocity and the direction of conduction change, as presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-00948-f007">Figure 7</xref>, as well as the OAP duration change at 20%, 50%, and 90% of repolarization (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-00948-f008">Figure 8</xref>), obtained under the control conditions and after treatment with the 
 <italic>E. ciliata</italic> of 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, and 0.3 μL/mL concentrations. Constructed conduction velocity maps demonstrate proportional changes under both control conditions and after application of 
 <italic>E. ciliata</italic>, and that there was no increase in the dispersion of this parameter. Mean values of conduction velocity in control and after 
 <italic>E. ciliata</italic> of a 0.1 µL/mL concentration are of 0.77 ± 0.06 and 0.50 ± 0.03, respectively, at epicardial stimulation (n = 5, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), and of 1.04 ± 0.08 and 0.49 ± 0.05, respectively, at endocardial stimulation (n = 6, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) (for concentration-dependence data see in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-biomolecules-10-00948">Figure S1</xref>).
