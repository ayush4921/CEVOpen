<p>Under the control conditions and at low concentrations of 
 <italic>E. ciliata</italic> extracts, as presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-00948-f007">Figure 7</xref>C, the direction and length of conduction vectors vary, especially at the bottom of conduction vector maps. However, at high concentrations, all vectors became of the same length and oriented in the same direction and this indicated harmonization in impulse propagation. Such uniform direction and the spread of electrical impulse propagation at high concentrations indicate that 
 <italic>E. ciliata</italic>, alongside with the antiarrhythmic features, might have a less pro-arrhythmic effect.
