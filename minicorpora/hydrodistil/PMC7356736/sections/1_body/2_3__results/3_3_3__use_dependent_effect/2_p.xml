<p>In the control, an increase in the pacing rate slightly reduced both the AP amplitude and duration, and slowed the dV/dt
 <sub>max</sub> down by 10.7 ± 2.1% with time constant (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-00948-f004">Figure 4</xref>B,D, markedly reduced dV/dt
 <sub>max</sub> if compared with the control. The kinetics of the AP upstroke dV/dt
 <sub>max</sub> depression was evaluated with an exponential approximation of the dV/dt
 <sub>max</sub> changes as a function of time. The time constant (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-00948-f004">Figure 4</xref>D, insert, was 0.55 s (on average was 0.63 ± 0.11), and dV/dt
 <sub>max</sub> was significantly reduced by 32.9 ± 4.8% s (n = 7, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). These data indicate that the 
 <italic>E. ciliata</italic> slowed the maximal velocity of AP upstroke depolarization down much stronger at a higher pacing rate, and the reaction of dV/dt
 <sub>max</sub> change is fast (
