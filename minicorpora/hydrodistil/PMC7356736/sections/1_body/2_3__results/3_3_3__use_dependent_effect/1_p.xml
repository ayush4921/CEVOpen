<p>It is typical, that the mode of action and efficacy of the antiarrhythmic preparations or local anesthetics, that slow down depolarization of the AP upstroke and inhibit Na
 <sup>+</sup>-channels, are highly dependent on their specific interaction with Na
 <sup>+</sup>-channels, depending on the channel state: open or closed, activated or inactivated. Therefore, the effectiveness of these preparations is use-dependent, and their activity in the heart may depend on stimulation rate, resting potential, and AP duration. Using the procedure to examine the use-dependent effects, i.e., changing the pacing cycle length from 400 to 200 ms, as presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-00948-f004">Figure 4</xref>, we revealed that
