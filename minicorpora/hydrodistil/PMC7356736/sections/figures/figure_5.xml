   <italic>E. ciliata</italic> effects on optically recorded APs using voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye. Atrial/endo-/epi-cardial pacing with a 300 ms period was applied. (

   <italic>E. ciliata</italic> (orange, grey, yellow and blue, respectively), followed by a washout period (WO; dotted). Notice a delay in activation time with 0.3 μL/mL concentration of the 
   <italic>E. ciliata</italic>, and reversibility. Zero time indicates the time of stimulus.
