 <caption> Changes in OAP duration maps induced by E. ciliata during epicardial stimulation. ( A) OAPD20, ( B) OAPD50, and ( C) OAPD90 maps in the control and after applying 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, and 0.3 ÂµL/mL concentrations of the E. ciliata, followed by a washout period. OAPD20, OAPD50, and OAPD90 maps calculated at 20%, 50%, and 90% of repolarization, respectively. The interval between isochrones is 5 ms. Other notations are the same as in Figure 7. </caption>
