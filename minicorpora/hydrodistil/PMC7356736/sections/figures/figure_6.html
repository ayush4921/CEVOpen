 <caption> Dependence of the OAP on the E. ciliata concentrations. Steady-state level measurements during atrial/endo-/epi-cardial stimulation (300 ms period) of ( A) activation time, ( B) voltage-sensitive fraction of fluorescence (ΔF/F), ( C) OAP upstroke duration (UD), and ( D) OAP duration (OAPD) at 20%, 50% and 90% of repolarization, done under the control (CON) conditions and at the end of each 10 min perfusion with 0.01, 0.03, and 0.1 µL/mL concentrations of the E. ciliata (except for 0.3 µL/mL the perfusion was ~5 min), followed by a washout (WO) period (* p &lt; 0.05 for E. ciliata vs. control; # p &lt; 0.05 for washout vs. E. ciliata of 0.3 µL/mL concentration; n = 6 for each). </caption>
