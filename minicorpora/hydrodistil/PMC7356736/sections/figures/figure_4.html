 <caption> Monitoring the use-dependence effect of the E. ciliata. ( A, B) APs and ( C, D) dV/dt max response to abrupt change of the pacing cycle length from 400 ms to 200 ms in the control and after action of the E. ciliata (0.1 μL/mL), respectively. Arrows on the horizontal bar indicate the moment of the pacing cycle length switch. Notice a stronger reduction of dV/dt max at an increased stimulation rate after application of the E. ciliata vs. control. For detection of the kinetics of dV/dt max depression see Methods, (D, Insert) experimental points of dV/dt max fitted with exponential decay (line) with τ = 0.55 s. </caption>
