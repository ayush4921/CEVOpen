 <caption> E. ciliata effects on the pseudo ECGs of Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts. Epicardial pacing with a 300 ms period was applied. ( A) Superimposition of steady-state pseudo ECG traces under control conditions (CON; black) and after application of 0.01, 0.03, 0.1 and 0.3 µL/mL concentrations of E. ciliata (orange, grey, yellow and blue, respectively) for 10 min each, followed by perfusion without E. ciliata (WO; dotted). Q, R, S, and T waves indicated. Notice a lengthened time-to-R max and shortened QT interval as indicated by dotted arrows 1 and 2, respectively. ( B) Three-dimensional (3D) view of pseudo ECGs, from front to back, showing time-dependent effect of increasing concentrations of E. ciliata from the same data as in (A), constructed by LabChart8 Pro software ECG analysis plot function, in which the X, Y and Z axis represent location, time, and height of the detected peaks of the pseudo ECG, respectively. Wave amplitudes are indicated by colors from blue to red. ( C) Mean data of QRS (upper) and QT (lower) interval change when applying different E. ciliata concentrations as indicated (* p &lt; 0.05 for E. ciliata vs. control; # p &lt; 0.05 for washout vs. E. ciliata of 0.3 µL/mL concentration; n = 5 for each). </caption>
