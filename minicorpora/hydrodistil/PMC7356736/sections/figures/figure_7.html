 <caption> Optical maps revealing E. ciliata effects on electrical activation process in the heart during epicardial stimulation. A voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye, di-4-ANBDQBS, was used. The pacing period was 300 ms. ( A) Activation time (in ms), ( B) conduction velocity (in m/s), and ( C) conduction vector maps in the control and after applying 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, and 0.3 ÂµL/mL concentrations of the E. ciliata, followed by a washout period. The interval between isochrones is 5 ms for the activation time, 0.1 m/s for the conduction velocity. Note that the conduction vector length is proportional to the conduction velocity. The direction of the activation wave movement is from blue-green to red. The stimulation electrode was located on the left close to the LV base. </caption>
