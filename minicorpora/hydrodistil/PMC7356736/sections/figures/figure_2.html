 <caption> E. ciliata effects on the action potentials (APs) of Langendorff-perfused rabbit heart. Epicardial pacing with a 300 ms period was applied. ( A) Superimposition of representative traces of APs from microelectrodes, from the same experiment as in Figure 1, under control conditions (CON; black) and after application of 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, and 0.3 ÂµL/mL concentrations of E. ciliata (orange, grey, yellow and blue, respectively), followed by washout without the E. ciliata (WO; dotted). ( B) Three-dimensional (3D) view of APs, from front to back, showing time-dependent effect of E. ciliata from the same data as in (A); 3D view construction details are the same as in Figure 1B. ( C) Values of the maximal velocity of APs upstroke (dV/dt max) after application of E. ciliata concentrations as indicated from the same experiment as in (A). </caption>
