 <caption> E. ciliata effects on optically recorded APs using voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye. Atrial/endo-/epi-cardial pacing with a 300 ms period was applied. ( A– C) Superimposition of the optical APs (OAPs) and ( D– F) their upstrokes on an expanded scale obtained in the control (CON; black) and after application of 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, and 0.3 μL/mL concentrations the E. ciliata (orange, grey, yellow and blue, respectively), followed by a washout period (WO; dotted). Notice a delay in activation time with 0.3 μL/mL concentration of the E. ciliata, and reversibility. Zero time indicates the time of stimulus. </caption>
