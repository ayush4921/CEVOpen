   <italic>E. ciliata</italic> effects on the pseudo ECGs of Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts. Epicardial pacing with a 300 ms period was applied. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Superimposition of steady-state pseudo ECG traces under control conditions (CON; black) and after application of 0.01, 0.03, 0.1 and 0.3 µL/mL concentrations of 
   <italic>E. ciliata</italic> (orange, grey, yellow and blue, respectively) for 10 min each, followed by perfusion without 
   <italic>E. ciliata</italic> (WO; dotted). Q, R, S, and T waves indicated. Notice a lengthened time-to-R
   <sub>max</sub> and shortened QT interval as indicated by dotted arrows 1 and 2, respectively. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Three-dimensional (3D) view of pseudo ECGs, from front to back, showing time-dependent effect of increasing concentrations of 
   <italic>E. ciliata</italic> from the same data as in (A), constructed by LabChart8 Pro software ECG analysis plot function, in which the X, Y and Z axis represent location, time, and height of the detected peaks of the pseudo ECG, respectively. Wave amplitudes are indicated by colors from blue to red. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Mean data of QRS (upper) and QT (lower) interval change when applying different 
   <italic>E. ciliata</italic> concentrations as indicated (* 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 for 
   <italic>E. ciliata</italic> vs. control; 
   <sup>#</sup>
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 for washout vs. 
   <italic>E. ciliata</italic> of 0.3 µL/mL concentration; n = 5 for each).
