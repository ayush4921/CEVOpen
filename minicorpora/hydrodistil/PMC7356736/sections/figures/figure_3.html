 <caption> Dependence of the AP parameters on E. ciliata concentrations. Steady-state level measurements during atrial/endo-/epi-cardial stimulation (300 ms period) of ( A) activation time, ( B) the maximal velocity of AP upstroke depolarization (dV/dt max), ( C) AP duration (APD) at 20%, 50% and 90% repolarization, and ( D) resting potential (RP), measured under control conditions (CON) and at the end of 10 min perfusion with each of 0.01, 0.03, 0.1 µL/mL concentrations of the E. ciliata (except for 0.3 µL/mL, which was ~5 min), followed by a washout period (WO) (* p &lt; 0.05 for E. ciliata vs. control; # p &lt; 0.05 for washout vs. E. ciliata of 0.3 µL/mL concentration; n = 7 for each). </caption>
