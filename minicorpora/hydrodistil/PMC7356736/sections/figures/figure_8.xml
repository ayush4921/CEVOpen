   <bold>A</bold>) OAPD20, (
   <bold>B</bold>) OAPD50, and (
   <bold>C</bold>) OAPD90 maps in the control and after applying 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, and 0.3 ÂµL/mL concentrations of the 
   <italic>E. ciliata</italic>, followed by a washout period. OAPD20, OAPD50, and OAPD90 maps calculated at 20%, 50%, and 90% of repolarization, respectively. The interval between isochrones is 5 ms. Other notations are the same as in
