   <italic>E. ciliata</italic> effects on the action potentials (APs) of Langendorff-perfused rabbit heart. Epicardial pacing with a 300 ms period was applied. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Superimposition of representative traces of APs from microelectrodes, from the same experiment as in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-00948-f001">Figure 1</xref>, under control conditions (CON; black) and after application of 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, and 0.3 ÂµL/mL concentrations of 
   <italic>E. ciliata</italic> (orange, grey, yellow and blue, respectively), followed by washout without the 
   <italic>E. ciliata</italic> (WO; dotted). (
   <bold>B</bold>) Three-dimensional (3D) view of APs, from front to back, showing time-dependent effect of 
   <italic>E. ciliata</italic> from the same data as in (A); 3D view construction details are the same as in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-00948-f001">Figure 1</xref>B. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Values of the maximal velocity of APs upstroke (dV/dt
   <sub>max</sub>) after application of 
   <italic>E. ciliata</italic> concentrations as indicated from the same experiment as in (A).
