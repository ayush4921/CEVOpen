 <p>In this study, hydrodistillation was used to obtain essential oils (EOs) from pepper (
  <italic>Piper nigrum</italic> L.) and clove (
  <italic>Eugenia caryophyllata</italic>) and co-hydrodistillation (addition of fatty acid ethyl esters as extraction co-solvents) was used to obtain functional extracts (FEs). Antifungal activity of EOs and FEs was evaluated by determination of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against 
  <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> and 
  <italic>Aspergillus niger.</italic> The results showed that pepper (
  <italic>Piper nigrum</italic>) and clove (
  <italic>Eugenia caryophyllata</italic>) essential oils and their functional extracts are effective 
  <italic>in vitro</italic> at concentrations from 400 to 500 ppm after 10 days of culturing. The essential oils and functional extracts were used on tomato fruit samples at three different concentrations: 350, 400, and 450 ppm
  <sup>5</sup>. Clove essential oil reduced the growth of 
  <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> from 50% to 70% and 
  <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> to 40%. The functional extracts (FEs) of clove and pepper, mixed with ethyl decanoate (FEs-C
  <sub>10</sub>), were the best combination for protecting the tomato fruit in vivo against both phytopathogenic fungi. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to identify eugenol as the principal compound in clove oil and limonene, sabinene, and 
  <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene in pepper oil.
