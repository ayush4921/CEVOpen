<p>In conclusion, clove (
 <italic>Eugenia caryophyllata</italic>) and pepper (
 <italic>Piper nigrum</italic> L.) essentials oils and functional extracts could provide an alternative solution to the use of hazardous chemical fungicides for the treatment of tomato fruit during storage and transportation to reduce postharvest infection. In view of the economic importance of tomato, the possibility of using products with a lower risk to human health and the environment than synthetic pesticides in controlling 
 <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> and 
 <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> wilt is very promising.
