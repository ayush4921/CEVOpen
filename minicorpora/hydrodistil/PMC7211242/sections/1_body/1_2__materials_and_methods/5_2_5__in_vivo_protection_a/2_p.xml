<p>Fresh and healthy round tomatoes (
 <italic>Solanum lycopersicum L</italic>.) were disinfected with 90% ethanol and rinsed with sterile distilled water. A 6 mm diameter hole was made on the skin of the tomato fruit using a sterile cork-borer, and then 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of the spore suspensions (1.5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> conidia/mL) was added on the area; then the 
 <italic>epidermis</italic> was put back and sealed with sterile petroleum jelly (only on the edges of the cut to avoid fruit oxidation). After fungal inoculation, tomato fruits were sprayed with EO and FEs at 350, 400, and 450 ppm. Control tomato fruits were sprayed with sterile distilled water-ethanol (2%). Treatments were randomly arranged with three replications. To promote infection, treated tomato fruits were kept in a humid chamber at 28°C in darkness. The diameter of the rotting area caused by 
 <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> and 
 <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> was measured every day during fifteen days' postinoculation.
