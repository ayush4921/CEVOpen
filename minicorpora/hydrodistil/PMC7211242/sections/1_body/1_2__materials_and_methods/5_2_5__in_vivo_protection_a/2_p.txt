0: Fresh and healthy round tomatoes ( Solanum lycopersicum L.) were disinfected with 90% ethanol and rinsed with sterile distilled water.
1: A 6 mm diameter hole was made on the skin of the tomato fruit using a sterile cork-borer, and then 100  L of the spore suspensions (1.5  10 5 conidia/mL) was added on the area; then the  epidermis was put back and sealed with sterile petroleum jelly (only on the edges of the cut to avoid fruit oxidation).
2: After fungal inoculation, tomato fruits were sprayed with EO and FEs at 350, 400, and 450 ppm.
3: Control tomato fruits were sprayed with sterile distilled water-ethanol (2%).
4: Treatments were randomly arranged with three replications.
5: To promote infection, treated tomato fruits were kept in a humid chamber at 28C in darkness.
6: The diameter of the rotting area caused by  Fusarium oxysporum and  Aspergillus niger was measured every day during fifteen days' postinoculation.
