0: Clove ( Eugenia caryophyllata) and pepper ( Piper nigrum L.) were individually subjected to a hydrodistillation process using the modified Schilcher device.
1: In hydrodistillation, the plants were immersed in water, where the system was heated to the boiling point of water.
2: For co-hydrodistillation, fatty acid ethyl esters were added as co-solvent, and the homogeneous mixture was called functional extracts (FEs).
3: The fatty acid ethyl esters used in this study were ethyl decanoate (C 10, CAS number 110-38-3), ethyl undecanoate (C 11, CAS number 627-90-7), ethyl dodecanoate (C 12, CAS number 106-33-2), and ethyl tetradecanoate E 14, CAS number 124-06-(1).
4: For this process, 200 g of vegetal material, 4 L of water, and 20 mL of ethyl ester were used for the clove and pepper [ 20].
