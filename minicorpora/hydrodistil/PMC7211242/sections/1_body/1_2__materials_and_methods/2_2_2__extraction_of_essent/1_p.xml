<p>Clove (
 <italic>Eugenia caryophyllata</italic>) and pepper (
 <italic>Piper nigrum</italic> L.) were individually subjected to a hydrodistillation process using the modified Schilcher device. In hydrodistillation, the plants were immersed in water, where the system was heated to the boiling point of water. For co-hydrodistillation, fatty acid ethyl esters were added as co-solvent, and the homogeneous mixture was called functional extracts (FEs). The fatty acid ethyl esters used in this study were ethyl decanoate (C
 <sub>10</sub>, CAS number 110-38-3), ethyl undecanoate (C
 <sub>11,</sub> CAS number 627-90-7), ethyl dodecanoate (C
 <sub>12,</sub> CAS number 106-33-2), and ethyl tetradecanoate E
 <sub>14,</sub> CAS number 124-06-(1). For this process, 200 g of vegetal material, 4 L of water, and 20 mL of ethyl ester were used for the clove and pepper [
