0: The essential oil and functional extracts were collected and diluted with hexane in a volumetric flask; the solutions obtained were analyzed by GC-MS (gas chromatography-mass spectrometry).
1: The analysis of essential oils and functional extracts was conducted using a gas chromatographic system (Perkin-Elmer Instrument, Auto system XL, USA) equipped with a DB-5 column (5% phenyl methylpolysiloxane, 20 m  0.1 mm i.d.
2: and 0.4 m film thickness) and a mass spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer instruments TurboMass Gold) as detector..
3: The carrier gas was helium, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min.
4: For the GC-FID analysis, the temperature was increased from 60C to 180C at 1C/min.
5: The injector and detector temperature were set at 180C.
