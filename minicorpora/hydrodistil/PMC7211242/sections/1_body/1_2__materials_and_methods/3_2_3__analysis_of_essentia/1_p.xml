<p>The essential oil and functional extracts were collected and diluted with hexane in a volumetric flask; the solutions obtained were analyzed by GC-MS (gas chromatography-mass spectrometry). The analysis of essential oils and functional extracts was conducted using a gas chromatographic system (Perkin-Elmer Instrument, Auto system XL, USA) equipped with a DB-5 column (5% phenyl methylpolysiloxane, 20 m × 0.1 mm i.d. and 0.4 µm film thickness) and a mass spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer instruments TurboMass Gold) as detector.. The carrier gas was helium, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. For the GC-FID analysis, the temperature was increased from 60°C to 180°C at 1°C/min. The injector and detector temperature were set at 180°C.</p>
