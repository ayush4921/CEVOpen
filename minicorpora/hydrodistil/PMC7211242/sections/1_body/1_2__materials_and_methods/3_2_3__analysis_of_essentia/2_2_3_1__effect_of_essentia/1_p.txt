0: In order to prove the efficacy of the bioactive compounds of EOs and FEs against  F. oxysporum and  A.  niger, the final concentrations of each used in potato dextrose agar (PDA) were 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 ppm.
1: The controls were prepared with agar and ethanol and pure ethyl decanoate, ethyl undecanoate, ethyl dodecanoate, and ethyl myristate at a 100 ppm concentration.
2: Treatments were randomly arranged with four replications.
3: To promote infection, treated tomato fruits were kept in a humid chamber at 30C in darkness.
4: The diameter of the radial growth caused by  Fusarium oxysporum and Aspergillus niger was measured 10 days after inoculation.
