The controls were prepared with agar and ethanol and pure ethyl decanoate, ethyl undecanoate, ethyl dodecanoate, and ethyl myristate at a 100 ppm concentration. Treatments were randomly arranged with four replications. To promote infection, treated tomato fruits were kept in a humid chamber at 30°C in darkness. The diameter of the radial growth caused by
