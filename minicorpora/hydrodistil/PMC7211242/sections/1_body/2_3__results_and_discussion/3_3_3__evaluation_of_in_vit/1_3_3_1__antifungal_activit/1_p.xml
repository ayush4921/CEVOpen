<p>The extracts' 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> fungicide activity was evaluated by determining the capacity of inhibition of mycelial growth of each of the species under study. The clove essential oil presented the greater biological activity of all the treatments used, achieving a total inhibition of the growth of the species evaluated. In the treatment of clove essential oil against 
 <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic>, the biological activity was proportional to the increase in concentration, as shown in 
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. It is observed a mycelial growth of 5.6 cm at a concentration of 100 ppm, with mycelial growth significantly reduced to 400 ppm (0.44 cm). At 500 ppm, it is observed a total inhibition of 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>, with the essential oil showing greater inhibition compared to the growth of the corresponding control sample at 7.72 cm. The same behavior was observed against the species 
 <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic>; the results obtained show a mycelial growth of 6.12 at a concentration of 100 ppm, which is modified at 200 ppm obtaining a value of 1.98 cm; total inhibition is observed at 400 ppm and above. In the case of clove functional extracts against mycelial growth of 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> (
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), the same behavior of the essential oil was observed, that is, an average growth of 6.5 cm was observed at a concentration of 100 ppm. The extracts of clove-C
 <sub>10</sub> and clove-C
 <sub>12</sub> showed a mycelial growth for 
 <italic>A. niger</italic> of 6.23 cm and 6.38 cm, respectively, at 100 ppm, very similar to the growth obtained at the same concentration of the clove essential oil. In the case of the extracts of clove C
 <sub>11</sub> and C
 <sub>14</sub> it was observed a mycelial growth similar to 
 <italic>A. niger</italic> at 100 ppm of 7.17–7.19 cm, higher values than those obtained with the clove essential oil. Different studies have demonstrated that clove essential oil possesses 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antifungal activity, affecting species that often develop in food, such as 
 <italic>Paecilomyces, Penicillium</italic> sp., 
 <italic>Rhizopus</italic> sp
 <italic>., Rhizomucor</italic> sp., and even some species of 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. It has also been demonstrated 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> that clove inhibits the growth of 
 <italic>Aspergillus flavus, A. niger</italic>, 
 <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic>, 
 <italic>F. chrysogenum</italic>, and 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> sp., starting at 500 and 1000 ppm [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Generally, the main components in essential oils reflect their biophysical and biological characteristics [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, it is reasonable to assume that the biological activity of the clove essential oil can be related to the presence of a high concentration of 
 <italic>Eugenol</italic> (75–100%) [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Components with phenolic structure such as eugenol are highly active against microorganisms [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. This phenolic compound can denature proteins, and it reacts with phospholipids of the cell membrane that change their permeability [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], which is explained by the acid nature of the hydroxyl group, which forms a hydrogen bond with an active enzymatic core.
