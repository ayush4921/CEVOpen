<p>Pepper essential oils and functional extracts did not show a significant inhibition activity against 
 <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> and 
 <italic>Aspergillus niger.</italic> In the case of the essential oil, it was observed a growth of 7.5 cm at 100 ppm and of 7.3 cm at 200 ppm, confirming that it remains constant up to 500 ppm where it is observed a reduction to 6.0 cm. In all the pepper functional extracts, there was a very similar behavior to essential oil, since in the extracts it was observed an average growth of 7.3 cm at concentrations of 100, 200, and 300 ppm, while at 400 and 500 ppm, there was a reduction to 6.8 cm and 6.5 cm, respectively. In the case of 
 <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic>, the growth was not affected significantly by the pepper essential oil, which at the concentrations of 100–300 ppm remained between 7.33–7.36 cm; however, at 400 ppm, there was a slight decrease to 6.81 cm. In the functional extracts, it is observed a similar behavior, obtaining lower growth in the extract pepper-C
 <sub>14</sub> of 7.25 cm and a maximum mycelial growth of 7.7 cm after the incubation period. Therefore, it may be concluded that pepper did not show fungistatic and fungicide activity before both fungi. However, studies have shown that pepper essential oil presents antifungal activity particularly against fungi such as 
 <italic>Trichophyton terrestre, T. tonsurans, Candida albicans, Monosporium apiospermum, A. fumigatus, A. nidulans, Sporotrichum schencki,</italic> and 
 <italic>Histoplasma capsulatum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]; this antimicrobial activity of the essential oil is influenced by their chemical composition, constituted by a combination of monoterpenoids and sesquiterpenoids considered responsible of the activity against organisms [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Some authors [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] mention that the primary target of antimicotic chemotherapeutic agents is the fungus membrane. Most fungi contain ergosterol as the main component of the membrane, except for some oomycetes. Thus, many antimicotic agents act either fixing ergosterol or blocking biosynthesis, inhibiting an enzyme of the group cytochromes P-450 which catalyzes one of the first steps in esterol biosynthesis in fungi and animal cells, producingdemethylation of lanosterol, biosynthetic precursor of cholesteroland ergosterol. Others antimycotic agents block squalene epoxidase and are often used as topicals.Therefore, strategies that alter or block ergosterol synthesis affect permeability of cell membrane and the activity of enzymes linked to such membrane, which leads to inhibition of growth and later to cellular death.
