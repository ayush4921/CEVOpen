<p>Based on the results obtained in the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> tests, it was evaluated the biological activity of essential oils and functional extracts against 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> and 
 <italic>A. niger</italic> with 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> methods. The damage in the tomato fruit was analyzed. In the evaluation, the extracts with the higher inhibitory activity were used, that is, the clove essential oil and functional extracts: clove-C
 <sub>10</sub>, clove-C
 <sub>11</sub>, clove-C
 <sub>12</sub>, and clove-C
 <sub>14</sub>, at concentrations of 350 ppm, 400 ppm, and 450 ppm. The results obtained are shown in 
 <xref rid="tab4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, where it can be observed that on the tomato surface there is a circular area, white at the beginning, evolving to a darker color. The lesions are observed covered with a cottony cluster of white mycelium, which causes softening and destruction of vegetable tissue; no exudate is produced, but dehydration and destruction of tissue occurs. As it can be observed, it was not possible to determine whether the clove essential oil and some functional extracts were capable of inhibiting the growth of 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>, except for the extract clove-C
 <sub>10</sub> where it could be observed a significant variation in each treatment. Soft rot generated by 
 <italic>A. niger</italic> could also be observed in the treatments where no inhibition was determined, with the presence of a fungal mass; in addition to this, no fungal development was present in the fruit surface, causing necrosis of the tissue that develops from the inoculation site to the internal region. Therefore, we can confirm that the essential oils and functional extracts evaluated 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> against the species 
 <italic>A. niger</italic> and 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> in the tomato fruit did not show strong inhibition; however, total inhibition could be demonstrated in the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> tests; this can be attributed to the existence of some factors that may affect the antifungal efficiency, such as the food components, inactivation due to the addition of other component, effects of pH over antifungal stability and activity, unequal distribution in the food matrix, and low solubility of extracts [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Additionally, Aguilar-Gonzalez et al. [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] demonstrated in vitro the effectiveness of mustard EO vapor against 
 <italic>A. niger</italic> in tomatoes and concluded that mustard EO contains highly volatile compounds with strong inhibitory effects. However, these results were obtained with essential oils used in the vapor phase.
