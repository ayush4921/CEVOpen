<p>The results obtained from the extraction process show that when comparing the extraction yields obtained by the hydrodistillation and co-hydrodistillation methods for each spice, the yield for clove is higher than pepper. This behavior is observed likewise in the percentages obtained from each of the functional extracts. This can be explained generally because in the plant, essential oils are stored or located in glands, conduits, sacs, or glandular hairs or in reservoirs in the plant; therefore, the exposure of these reservoirs to the action of the distillation vapor allows the vapor to soften or break the walls of the oily glands, releasing the oils, favoring extraction yield [

 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, which shows the principal components of clove and pepper essential oils and functional extracts. In the clove extracts, 
 <italic>Eugenol</italic> was identified as majority component, which is also found in majority proportion (70–85%). Other determined components are the esters ethyl decanoate, ethyl undecanoate, ethyl dodecanoate, and ethyl tetradecanoate, whose percentage corresponds to 4–17% of the relative composition; these were added in the co-hydrodistillation process. In addition to these components, there were identified eugenyl acetate (15%) and 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene. These results match Hernández-Ochoa et al. [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and Jirovetz et al. [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], who report that clove essential oil may contain up to 90% eugenol, in addition to eugenyl acetate (2% to 7%), as well as the presence of caryophyllene. In the case of the pepper essential oil, it was determined the presence of limonene (18.8%), sabinene (16.5%), 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene (15.6%), and 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene (10%) as majority compounds; in addition to this, another group of compounds was determined at a lower proportion (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). These results are consistent with the reports of several authors [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], where these are identified as majority compounds; however, they mention the presence of a total of 22 compounds in some cases, which differ from the total 8 compounds that were determined at a lower proportion. This difference in the chemical composition may be attributed to the origin of the fruit, as well as to different growing and/or simple conservation conditions.
