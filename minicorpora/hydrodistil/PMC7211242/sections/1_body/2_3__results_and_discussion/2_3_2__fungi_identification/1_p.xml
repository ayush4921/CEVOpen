 <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> showed an exponential growth, as well as a flat cottony morphology that tended to extend, developing a white aerial mycelium as observed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. It can be observed the production of a mycelium of characteristic white color which turned into pink salmon; it was also observed that white colonies spread pigmentation to the medium. After 72 hours, the growth of the colonies was 2 cm. Microscopically were observed abundant microconidia, which are generated in simple phialides emerging laterally; they present a slightly curved oval-elipsoid form, and they lack septa. Macroconidia also present a pedicelled base; some have three to five septa; three-septate spores were more common. These results match the research of Nelson [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], where it is mentioned the presence of three kinds of spores: macroconidia, elongated spores with 3 to 5 septa, with a shape typical of the genus; microconidia, oval shaped and abundant; and chlamydospores that allow distinguishing 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> from 
 <italic>F. moniliforme</italic> [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In the case of 
 <italic>Aspergillus niger,</italic> it was observed that colonies, initially white, grew fast; however, the mycelial surface was covered with black spots that represent Aspergillus heads (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), measuring up to 1 mm in diameter, charged with black spores that turned into a pulverulent culture, forming a dense felt of erect conidiophores. The observed microscopic characteristics showed that it presents a single conidiophore originated in a partitioned hypha; this aerial conidiophore ends in an enlarged vesicle containing double or single projections; these are phialides, out of which extends a single, sometimes long chain of small round conidia [
