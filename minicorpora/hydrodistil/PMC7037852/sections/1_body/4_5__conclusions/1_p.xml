<p>This study highlights the potential to produce nutmeg EO fractions with diverse compositions and bioactivity from the same set of seeds. Capturing EO at sequential timeframes can generate EO fractions containing desired characteristics that best suites the needed industrial applications. For example, nutmeg EO with higher concentrations of α-thujene, α-pinene, camphehe, sabinene, and β-pinene can be obtained if it is captured during the first minutes of the distillation. The regression models developed in this study can be utilized to predict EO yield and composition of fractions at any given duration of DT. The regression models could also be useful to compare data from reports on oil yield and composition.</p>
