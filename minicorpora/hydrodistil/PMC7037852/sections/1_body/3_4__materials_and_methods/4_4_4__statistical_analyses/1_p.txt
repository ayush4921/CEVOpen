0: One-way analysis of variance was conducted to determine the effect of distillation time (DT: 0.00.5, 0.51.0, 1.02.5, 2.55.0, 5.010, 1030, 3060, 6090, 90120, and 120240 min as well as straight 0-240 min (Control)) on nutmeg EO content (%), and the concentration (%) of -thujene, -pinene, camphene, sabinene, -pinene, myrcene, -phellandrene, 3-carene, -terpinene, p-cymene, limonene, -terpinene, terpinolene, terpinen-4-ol, safrole, and myristicin.
1: For each response, the validity of model assumptions was verified by examining the residuals as described in Montgomery [ 25].
2: Since the effect of distillation time was significant ( p-value< 0.05) on all response variables, multiple means comparison was completed using Tukeys studentized range test (HSD) at the 5% level of significance, and letter groupings were generated.
3: This multiple means comparison method was used because of the low experimental error, and the methods ability to control Type I experimentwise (family) error rate, which is very important when there are such a large number (11) of means to compare.
4: The analysis was completed using the GLM (General Linear Model) Procedure of SAS (Statistical Analysis System) software [ 26].
