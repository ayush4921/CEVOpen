<p>One-way analysis of variance was conducted to determine the effect of distillation time (DT: 0.0–0.5, 0.5–1.0, 1.0–2.5, 2.5–5.0, 5.0–10, 10–30, 30–60, 60–90, 90–120, and 120–240 min as well as straight 0-240 min (Control)) on nutmeg EO content (%), and the concentration (%) of α-thujene, α-pinene, camphene, sabinene, β-pinene, myrcene, α-phellandrene, 3-carene, α-terpinene, p-cymene, limonene, γ-terpinene, terpinolene, terpinen-4-ol, safrole, and myristicin. For each response, the validity of model assumptions was verified by examining the residuals as described in Montgomery [

 <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05) on all response variables, multiple means comparison was completed using Tukey’s studentized range test (HSD) at the 5% level of significance, and letter groupings were generated. This multiple means comparison method was used because of the low experimental error, and the method’s ability to control Type I experimentwise (family) error rate, which is very important when there are such a large number (11) of means to compare. The analysis was completed using the GLM (General Linear Model) Procedure of SAS (Statistical Analysis System) software [
