<p>The relationships between distillation time (DT; the 10 timeframes excluding the control) and the concentrations of α-pinene, camphene, sabinene, β-pinene, myrcene, α-phellandrene, 3-carene, 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene, and limonene were adequately described by the asymptotic (convex) model (Equation (1)); the relationships between DT and the concentrations of α-thujene, α-terpinene, γ-terpinene, and terpinolene were adequately described by the power model (Equation (2)); and the relationship between DT and the concentration (%) of myristicin was adequately described by Michaelis–Menten model (Equation (3)). There was no definite relationship between DT and nutmeg EO content, as well as between DT and the concentrations of terpinen-4-ol and safrole. Since all these three models shown in Equation (1), Equation (2), and Equation (3) are nonlinear, their parameters were estimated iteratively using the NLIN Procedure of SAS [

Validity of the normality, constant variance, and independence assumptions on the error terms were verified by examining the residuals [
