0: The relationships between distillation time (DT; the 10 timeframes excluding the control) and the concentrations of -pinene, camphene, sabinene, -pinene, myrcene, -phellandrene, 3-carene,  p-cymene, and limonene were adequately described by the asymptotic (convex) model (Equation (1)); the relationships between DT and the concentrations of -thujene, -terpinene, -terpinene, and terpinolene were adequately described by the power model (Equation (2)); and the relationship between DT and the concentration (%) of myristicin was adequately described by MichaelisMenten model (Equation (3)).
1: There was no definite relationship between DT and nutmeg EO content, as well as between DT and the concentrations of terpinen-4-ol and safrole.
2: Since all these three models shown in Equation (1), Equation (2), and Equation (3) are nonlinear, their parameters were estimated iteratively using the NLIN Procedure of SAS [ 26] and the fitted models met all model adequacy requirements described in Bates and Watts [ 27].
3: (1)Y=12e3x+(2)Y=1X2+(3)Y=1x2+x+ where Y is the dependent (response) variable, X is the independent (DT) variable, and  is the error term assumed to have normal distribution with constant variance.
4: Validity of the normality, constant variance, and independence assumptions on the error terms were verified by examining the residuals [ 27].
