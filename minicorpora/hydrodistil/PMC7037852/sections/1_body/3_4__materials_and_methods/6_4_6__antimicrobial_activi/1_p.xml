<p>The antimicrobial testing of the nutmeg seeds EOs was also performed at the NCNPR, University, MS. The primary screening for antimicrobial activity of nutmeg seeds EOs obtained from the DT treatments (all in two replicates) were tested for antifungal activity against 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, 
 <italic>C. glabrata</italic>, 
 <italic>C. krusei</italic>, 
 <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic>, 
 <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> and antibacterial potential against Gram positive bacteria 
 <italic>Staphylococus aureus</italic>, methicillin resistant 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>Mycobacterium intracellulare</italic> and Gram negative bacteria 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aerogenosa</italic> at a concentration of 50 Î¼g/mL. The % inhibition was calculated following the method published previously [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-25-00565" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The antifungal activity was tested using amphotericin B, the antibacterial drug control was ciprofloxacin.
