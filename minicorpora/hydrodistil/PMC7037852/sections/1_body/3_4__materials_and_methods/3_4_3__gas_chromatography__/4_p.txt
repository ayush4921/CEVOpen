0: Compounds were quantified by performing area percentage calculations based on the total combined FID area.
1: For example, the area for each reported peak was divided by total integrated area from the FID chromatogram from all reported peaks and multiplied by 100 to arrive at a percentage.
2: The percentage of a peak is a percentage relative to all other constituents integrated in the FID chromatogram.
