0: Compounds were identified by Retention Index and Kovat Index analysis [ 24], direct comparison of MS and retention time to authentic standards, and/or comparison of mass spectra with those reported in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) mass spectra database.
1: Commercial standards were purchased for all but one (-thujene) constituents analyzed to provide unequivocal identification.
2: Commercial standards of -pinene, camphene, sabinene, -pinene, -phellandrene, 3-carene, -terpinene,  p-cymene, limonene, -terpinene, terpinolene, terpinen-4-ol, safrole, and myristicin were obtained from SigmaAldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA), and myrcene, from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerlands).
3: Standards were injected and compared with retention time and mass spectra data of oil and used for identification.
