0: Nutmeg EO samples were analyzed by GCMSFID on an Agilent (Santa Clara, CA, USA) 7890A GC system equipped with an Agilent 5975C inert XL MSD with triple axis detector and an Agilent 7693 autosampler (Santa Clara, CA, USA).
1: Chemical standards and oils were analyzed using a DB-5 column (30 m  0.25 mm fused silica capillary column, film thickness of 0.25 m) operated using the following conditions: injector T 240 C; column temp., 60 to 240 C at 3 C/min, held at 240 C for 5 min; carrier gas, He; injection volume, 1 L (split ratio 25:1); MS mass range from 50 to 550  m/ z; filament delay of 3.5 min; injection volume, 1 L (split ratio 50:1); FID temperature was 300 C. Post-column splitting was performed so that 50% of outlet flow proceeds to FID and 50% to mass spectrometry (MS) detection.
