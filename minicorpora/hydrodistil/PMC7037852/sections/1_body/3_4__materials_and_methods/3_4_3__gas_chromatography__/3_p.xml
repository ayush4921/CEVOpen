<p>Compounds were identified by Retention Index and Kovat Index analysis [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-25-00565" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], direct comparison of MS and retention time to authentic standards, and/or comparison of mass spectra with those reported in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) mass spectra database. Commercial standards were purchased for all but one (α-thujene) constituents analyzed to provide unequivocal identification. Commercial standards of α-pinene, camphene, sabinene, β-pinene, α-phellandrene, 3-carene, α-terpinene, 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene, limonene, γ-terpinene, terpinolene, terpinen-4-ol, safrole, and myristicin were obtained from Sigma–Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA), and myrcene, from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerlands). Standards were injected and compared with retention time and mass spectra data of oil and used for identification.
