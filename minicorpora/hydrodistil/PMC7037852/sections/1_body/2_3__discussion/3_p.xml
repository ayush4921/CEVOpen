<p>Comparing the antimicrobial activities of the four representative fractions (EO at DT 1–2.5 min, EO at DT 10–30 min, EO at DT 120–240 min, and EO at DT 0–240 min) revealed slight potency of EO at DT 120–240 min against 
 <italic>C. neoformans</italic> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 195.206 μg/mL) compared to the other three fractions (IC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt;200 μg/mL). Considering the variation of the EO (%) highlight the presence of myristicin in EO at DT 120–240 min, that agrees with what is known about the activity of myristicin against 
 <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> [

 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> compared to the other three fractions. The variation of the EO (%) highlight the presence of sabinene in EO at 1–2.5 min DT, which agrees with what is known about the activity of sabinene against
