<p>Many reports have highlighted the importance of nutmeg EO and the use of hydrodistillation in generating nutmeg EO, however in-depth study was needed for evaluating the captured nutmeg EO in sequential timeframes during hydrodistillation in terms of their chemical compositions and bioactivity. The concentration of low boiling point compounds generally was high in the initial DT fractions, while the concentration of compounds with higher boiling points was higher in the later fractions.</p>
