<p>The concentration of three major oil constituents (α-pinene BP 156 °C, sabinene 163–165 °C, and β-pinene BP 166 °C) varied significantly as a function of the DT, instead of their boiling points. Although it may seem logical that the concentrations of the EO constituents would vary as a function of their boiling points, there are many additional factors that have a greater influence on the final concentration and yield [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-25-00565" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. These differences in concentrations of the EO constituents unrelated to their comparable boiling points could be attributed to the variation in the availability degree of various tissues for extraction. The oil from 0–0.5 min DT had the highest concentration (%) of α-pinene, β-pinene, and sabinene compared to the oils from the other DT.
