Nutmeg is listed among the most traded commodities in the world according to the Product Complexity Index (PCI); 81.7% of the nutmeg export market worldwide is mainly coming from 5 countries; India, Indonesia, Netherlands, The United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Sri Lanka, while the rest is coming from other countries. According to the Office of Export Controls (OEC), India is considered to be the leading exporter of nutmeg worldwide where the market has reached $107 million in 2016. It is mainly cultivated in Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and North East India regions. Although India is the largest producer, the produced amount is not enough to cover local consumption. Indonesia is the world’s top producer of nutmeg (~50% of the world’s production) making up 29% of the world’s market share in 2016 ($96.6 million from nutmeg exports). In Europe, Netherlands is the largest importer and exporter of nutmeg (nutmeg exports were worth $27.1 million in 2016 constituting ~8.1% of the global market share), where it mainly imports its nutmeg from Indonesia and re-exports it to other countries such as the United States and European Union countries.
