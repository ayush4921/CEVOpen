<p>Nutmeg extracts and essential oil (EO) are used in new drug developments in India, China, and other tropical countries due to the various pharmacological activities. Sabinene (20.2%), terpinen-4-ol (12.1%), safrole (10.3%), α-pinene (9.7%), β-phellandrene (6.6%), and γ-terpinene (5.9%) were reported to be some of the main compounds of nutmeg EO, which is extracted by distillation [

 <xref rid="B17-molecules-25-00565" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] have been reported from the plant with various pharmacological properties including anticancer and antidepressant activities. Nutmeg is also known to control vomiting and relax spasms as well as possessing insecticidal, fungicidal, and bactericidal activities [

 <xref rid="B15-molecules-25-00565" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Most tropical countries recognized nutmeg in their food and medicinal value herbal lists due to its easy collection and its biological activities. The seeds have been taken internally in the treatment of diarrhea, dysentery, vomiting, and abdominal distension, while externally the seed is used to treat toothache and rheumatic pain [

 <xref rid="B19-molecules-25-00565" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], nutmeg EO could alleviate the Complete Freund’s Adjuvant-injection (CFA) induced joint swelling, via inhibition of COX-2 expression and blood substance P level, which highlights the potential of nutmeg oil to control chronic pain. Nutmeg EO has shown antibacterial activity against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria such as

 <xref rid="B20-molecules-25-00565" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Based on previous research and reports, nutmeg EO has significant potential for use in the medicinal and fragrance industries. There is lack of sufficient research on nutmeg EO elution as a function of distillation time. Therefore, the hypothesis of this study was that capturing the nutmeg essential oil (EO) in sequential timeframes during hydrodistillation would generate fractions containing unique compositions and bioactivity.
