0: Nutmeg extracts and essential oil (EO) are used in new drug developments in India, China, and other tropical countries due to the various pharmacological activities.
1: Sabinene (20.2%), terpinen-4-ol (12.1%), safrole (10.3%), -pinene (9.7%), -phellandrene (6.6%), and -terpinene (5.9%) were reported to be some of the main compounds of nutmeg EO, which is extracted by distillation [ 10, 11].
2: Nutmeg has been used in folk medicine for multiple purposes such as an antimicrobial, antioxidant, psychostimulant, and antithrombotic [ 12].
3: In Ayurveda, the seeds had been used to treat poor digestion, insomnia, and urinary incontinence [ 13].
4: Currently nutmeg is known for the treatment of various health disorders, such as bowel movement irregularities, rheumatoid arthritis, and muscle spasm [ 8].
5: In some countries like Zanzibar, nutmeg was chewed as an alternative to smoking marijuana [ 14].
6: Some studies have highlighted the potential of nutmeg as an anticonvulsant, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory herb.
7: Lignans and neolignans [ 15, 16, 17] have been reported from the plant with various pharmacological properties including anticancer and antidepressant activities.
8: Nutmeg is also known to control vomiting and relax spasms as well as possessing insecticidal, fungicidal, and bactericidal activities [ 18].
9: The nutmeg EO has been used externally due to its anti-inflammatory effect [ 15].
10: Most tropical countries recognized nutmeg in their food and medicinal value herbal lists due to its easy collection and its biological activities.
11: The seeds have been taken internally in the treatment of diarrhea, dysentery, vomiting, and abdominal distension, while externally the seed is used to treat toothache and rheumatic pain [ 19].
12: According to Zhang et al.
13: [ 19], nutmeg EO could alleviate the Complete Freunds Adjuvant-injection (CFA) induced joint swelling, via inhibition of COX-2 expression and blood substance P level, which highlights the potential of nutmeg oil to control chronic pain.
14: Nutmeg EO has shown antibacterial activity against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria such as  Escherichia coli,  Salmonella choleraesuis, and  Staphylococcus aureus [ 20].
15: Based on previous research and reports, nutmeg EO has significant potential for use in the medicinal and fragrance industries.
16: There is lack of sufficient research on nutmeg EO elution as a function of distillation time.
17: Therefore, the hypothesis of this study was that capturing the nutmeg essential oil (EO) in sequential timeframes during hydrodistillation would generate fractions containing unique compositions and bioactivity.
