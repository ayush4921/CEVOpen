<p>Nutmeg seeds EO obtained at various time frames were tested for their antimalarial activity against 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum D6</italic>, where nutmeg EO at 120–240 min DT was found to be weakly active followed by nutmeg EO at 10–30 min DT, and the control nutmeg EO (nonstop 0–240 min DT), respectively (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-00565-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). However, nutmeg EO at 1–2.5 min DT was found to be the most active against 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum D6</italic>. The nutmeg EO fraction collected at 120–240 min DT was found to be slightly active against 
 <italic>C. neoformans;</italic> however, no significant activity was observed against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, 
 <italic>A. fumigates</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, MRSA, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>K. pneumonia</italic> and VRE (
