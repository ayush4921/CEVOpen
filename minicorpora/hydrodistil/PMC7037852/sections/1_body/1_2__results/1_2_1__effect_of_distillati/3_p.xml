<p>Overall, the concentrations of α-thujene α-pinene, camphene, sabinene, and β-pinene were the highest in the earlier fractions (0–0.5 min) and lower in later fractions (90–120 and 120–240 min) (

 <italic>ρ</italic>-cymene and limonene was low in the initial fraction, and then increased in the middle fractions, followed by decrease in later fractions (
