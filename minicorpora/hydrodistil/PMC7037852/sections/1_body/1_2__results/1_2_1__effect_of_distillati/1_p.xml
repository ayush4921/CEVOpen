<p>Ten nutmeg EO fractions were captured at the following distillation timeframes (DT): 0.0–0.5, 0.5–1.0, 1.0–2.5, 2.5–5.0, 5.0–10, 10–30, 30–60, 60–90, 90–120, 120–240 min, and through a non-stop 240 min distillation. The hydrodistillation process employed in this study mimics the process employed by the commercial nutmeg oil extraction facilities. The chemical profiles of these EO fractions were compared to nutmeg EO from the control treatment (non-stop 240 min distillation). DT had significant effects on all of the measured responses, and especially on nutmeg EO profile (

The sum of oil yields from different fractions was approximately equal to the oil yield in the non-stop control, indicating no significant losses in the process of capturing the fractions sequentially.
