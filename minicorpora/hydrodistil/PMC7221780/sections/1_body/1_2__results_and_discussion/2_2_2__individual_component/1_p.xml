<p>Individual treatments of 
 <italic>l</italic>-menthol, 
 <italic>l</italic>-menthyl acetate, 
 <italic>l</italic>-menthone, and piperitone were performed at 240 °C for 60 min, and the results before and after the treatments are shown as 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-01953-f002">Figure 2</xref>a–d, respectively. As seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-01953-f002">Figure 2</xref>a, 
 <italic>l</italic>-menthol exhibited a retention time of approximately 9.52 min, and the shoulder peak was ascribed to a stereoisomer of menthol, based on the GC-MS result. However, to simplify the discussion, the stereoisomer was not considered thereafter in this study. Following the treatment, the peak area of 
 <italic>l</italic>-menthol decreased, while the peaks of menthone (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-01953-f002">Figure 2</xref>a, left inserted figure) and piperitone (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-01953-f002">Figure 2</xref>a, right inserted figure) appeared. 
 <italic>l</italic>-Menthyl acetate gave rise to a peak with a retention time of approximately 6.64 min, as seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-01953-f002">Figure 2</xref>b. Analogous to 
 <italic>l</italic>-menthol, 
 <italic>l</italic>-menthyl acetate exhibited a shoulder peak close to the main peak, which was likewise attributed to a stereoisomer of menthyl acetate. The inset in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-01953-f002">Figure 2</xref>b indicated that the peak corresponding to 
 <italic>l</italic>-menthol appeared after the treatment of 
 <italic>l</italic>-menthyl acetate. The results suggest that the ester bond of 
 <italic>l</italic>-menthyl acetate was hydrolyzed by subcritical water, and 
 <italic>l</italic>-menthyl acetate was thereby converted into 
 <italic>l</italic>-menthol. As the 
 <italic>l</italic>-menthol peak was small, this indicated that it was likely immediately further degraded. The produced acetic acid was most probably responsible for accelerating the degradation by increasing ionic products under subcritical water conditions. Prior to treatment, 
 <italic>l</italic>-menthone had a retention time of 4.50 min, while two shoulders appeared at 4.29 and 5.00 min, as evident in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-01953-f002">Figure 2</xref>c. After the treatment, one major peak (4.50 min) and three shoulders (4.27, 4.78, 5.00 min) were detected. According to the results of GC-MS, the three shoulders were all stereoisomers of 
 <italic>l</italic>-menthone. The shoulders at 4.78 and 5.00 min became more prominent after the subcritical water treatment. These results suggested that the rearrangement reactions of menthone occurred under subcritical water conditions. In the right-hand inset of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-01953-f002">Figure 2</xref>c, a peak at 13.47 min is evident, which was concluded to arise from piperitone. That is, in addition to the rearrangement reactions, the conversion of 
 <italic>l</italic>-menthone to piperitone also occurred under subcritical water conditions. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-01953-f002">Figure 2</xref>d, the piperitone peak appeared at 13.61 min, and its peak area decreased following subcritical water treatment. A noted peak with a retention time of 23.54 min showed a large increase after the treatment, and was identified as thymol based on the mass spectral library of NIST 14 with a possibility of 60.2%. A peak at 24.56 min was identified as 1-isocyanonaphthalene with a possibility of 62.7%, which would be inaccurately assigned as a cyano derivative, that is, the origin of nitrogen was uncertain. Moreover, since all the other minority peaks was also never assigned with low possibility (below 30%) based on the mass spectral library. According to these results, piperitone was likely oxidized, and then converted to thymol under subcritical water conditions.
