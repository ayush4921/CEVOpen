<p>In our previous study, excellent yields of 
 <italic>l</italic>-menthol and 
 <italic>l</italic>-menthone could be obtained from Japanese mint leaves at 180 °C within 5 min. In this study, the residual ratios of 
 <italic>l</italic>-menthol, 
 <italic>l</italic>-menthone, 
 <italic>l</italic>-menthyl acetate, and piperitone were 99.5%, 99.2%, 97.7%, and 99.3%, respectively, under the same treatment conditions (180 °C, 5 min). That is, subcritical water did not lead to significant loss of Japanese mint essential oil under optimal extraction conditions (180 °C, 5 min) [
