<p>Small-scale subcritical water treatment of the four components (
 <italic>l</italic>-menthol, 
 <italic>l</italic>-menthone, piperitone, and 
 <italic>l</italic>-menthyl acetate) with an excellent throughput was successfully performed in batch mode. Each treatment was conducted on 10 µL of sample. The results of the treatments at 180–240 °C for 5–60 min are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-01953-f001">Figure 1</xref>. Following GC analysis of the sample, the residual ratio was estimated by considering peak areas of the components. The results indicated that the residual ratio of 
 <italic>l</italic>-menthol decreased to 89.3% at 180 °C after 60 min. In the same 60 min treatment, the ratio of 
 <italic>l</italic>-menthol further decreased to 81.6% when the temperature was increased to 240 °C. As 
 <italic>l</italic>-menthyl acetate maintained its residual ratio above 90% after treatment at 240 °C for 60 min, 
 <italic>l</italic>-menthyl acetate was clearly more heat resistant compared to 
 <italic>l</italic>-menthol. In the 60 min treatment, the residual ratio of 
 <italic>l</italic>-menthone was 94.7% at 180 °C, decreasing to 82.2%, 71.3%, and 62.1% as the temperature increased to 200, 220, and 240 °C, respectively. That is, 
 <italic>l</italic>-menthone was the most temperature sensitive among the four components. Piperitone exhibited moderate heat resistance. The residual ratio of piperitone was 89.9% at 180 °C in the 60 min treatment, and it decreased to 73.4% as the temperature was increased to 240 °C.
