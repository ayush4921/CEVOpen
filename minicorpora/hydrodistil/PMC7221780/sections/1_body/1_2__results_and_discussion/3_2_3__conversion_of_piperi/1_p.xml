<p>To further investigate the conversion of piperitone to thymol, a small-scale subcritical water treatment of piperitone was carried out at 240 °C for 60, 120, and 180 min, and the results are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-01953-f003">Figure 3</xref>. The relative reference factors (RRFs) of piperitone and thymol to phenol were 1.02 ± 0.08 and 1.69 ± 0.08, respectively. The amount of piperitone decreased as the treatment time increased, decreasing to 0.51% (
 <italic>w/w</italic>) within 180 min. Approximately 0.03% (
 <italic>w/w</italic>) thymol was generated at 60 min; however, the concentration of thymol remained the same when the treatment time was extended to 120 min or to 180 min. It was therefore considered that thymol decomposed rapidly once it was generated from piperitone under subcritical water conditions at 240 °C. However, detailed elucidation of the mechanism and kinetics requires further investigation.
