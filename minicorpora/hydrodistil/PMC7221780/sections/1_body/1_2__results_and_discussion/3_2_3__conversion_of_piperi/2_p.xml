<p>To investigate the reaction occurred in natural material, Japanese mint essential oil was treated at 220 °C for 5 min and the results compared with untreated sample are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-01953-f004">Figure 4</xref>. The peak of menthol decreased approximately 7.5% based on the peak area (adjusted by internal standard), and this result was consistent with the result shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-01953-f003">Figure 3</xref>. The peak area of menthyl acetate decreased approximately 3.7%, which was lower than that of piperitone (9.8%). This result was also consistent with the result in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-01953-f003">Figure 3</xref> for that menthyl acetate had higher thermal stability than piperitone under subcritical water condition. Since the peak of thymol increased approximately 13.1% after 5 min treatment at 220 °C, Japanese mint essential oil, as a natural material, was considered to have similar thermal decomposition characteristics to the standard reagents even the composition ratio of menthol in the oil was over 70% [
