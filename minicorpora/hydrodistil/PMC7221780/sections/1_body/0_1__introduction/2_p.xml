<p>Subcritical water is also known as hot pressured water, its temperature being above the boiling point (100 °C), and below the critical point (374 °C). The liquid state of subcritical water is maintained by an external force or its own high vapor pressure in an enclosed space. As subcritical water has highly ionic characteristics and a low dielectric constant (ε), it is regarded as an excellent solvent for obtaining both hydrophobic and hydrophilic substances from botanical materials [

In the standard batch-wise extraction by subcritical water, mint essential oil is extracted along with dissolved substances, such as carbohydrates and proteins, necessitating additional separation operations for recovering the essential oil. In order to minimize the effort and improve extraction efficiency, we have proposed a modified method, involving subcritical water treatment coupled with pressure-releasing distillation, to obtain essential oil from Japanese mint [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-25-01953" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. By employing this specialized method for the recovery of essential oil, we could avoid the step of separating the liquid from solid residue, and the highest total yield of 30.5 mg/g-dry leaves of essential oil was achieved with a rapid extraction time of 5 min at 180 °C.
