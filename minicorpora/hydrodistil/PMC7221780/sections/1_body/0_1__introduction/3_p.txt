0: The highly ionic characteristics and a low dielectric constant were regarded as pivotal for improving the extraction efficiency, however, the phenomena of conversion and decomposition of mint essential oil components were observed at higher extraction temperatures and extended extraction times during subcritical water treatment [ 11, 12].
1: Conversion and decomposition were considered to be the reason for loss of product during extraction.
2: Thus far, materials subjected to subcritical water treatment have been natural products, and analysis of extract compositions has been too complicated.
3: Therefore, the phenomena of conversion and decomposition have not been clarified.
4: In order to further improve the extraction efficiency and reduce the loss of essential oil during subcritical water treatment, it is necessary to understand the mechanisms involved in conversion and decomposition of essential oil components under subcritical water conditions.
5: The aim of this study is to investigate the possible mechanism of conversion and decomposition of the major components of mint essential oil during subcritical water treatment.
6: The four major components,  l-menthol,  l-menthone, piperitone, and  l-menthyl acetate, were subjected to subcritical water treatment, and the batch-wise method was employed.
7: Moreover, in order to improve experimental throughput for measuring compound stabilities in subcritical water treatment, a small-scale technique utilizing ampoules was developed and employed.
8: Since the optimized treatment condition was indicated to be 180 C for 5 min in our previous study [ 11, 12], the longer treatment time and higher treatment temperature were examined in this study to further evaluate the thermal stability of the major components.
