<p>Mint essentials oils are well-known and popular products for their cooling and invigorating effects. Mint essential oils are generally obtained from Japanese mint (
 <italic>Mentha arvensis L.</italic>), peppermint (
 <italic>Mentha piperita, L.</italic>), and spearmint (
 <italic>Mentha spicata L.</italic>). 
 <italic>l</italic>-Menthol is the most abundant component in the Japanese mint and peppermint essential oils, while 
 <italic>l</italic>-carvone is the most abundant component in spearmint essential oil [

 <italic>l</italic>-menthol content than that of peppermint essential oil, and the proportion of 
 <italic>l</italic>-menthol in Japanese mint essential oil can exceed 70% [
