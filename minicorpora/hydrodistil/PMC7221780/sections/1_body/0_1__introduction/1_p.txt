0: Mint essentials oils are well-known and popular products for their cooling and invigorating effects.
1: Mint essential oils are generally obtained from Japanese mint ( Mentha arvensis L.), peppermint ( Mentha piperita, L.), and spearmint ( Mentha spicata L.).
2: l-Menthol is the most abundant component in the Japanese mint and peppermint essential oils, while  l-carvone is the most abundant component in spearmint essential oil [ 1, 2].
3: Japanese mint essential oil is renowned for having a higher  l-menthol content than that of peppermint essential oil, and the proportion of  l-menthol in Japanese mint essential oil can exceed 70% [ 3].
4: Hydrodistillation is the most universal and conventional method for obtaining essential oil from mint [ 4].
5: However, the drawback of this method is the time-consuming extraction.
