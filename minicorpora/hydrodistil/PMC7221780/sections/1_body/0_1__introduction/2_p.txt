0: Subcritical water is also known as hot pressured water, its temperature being above the boiling point (100 C), and below the critical point (374 C).
1: The liquid state of subcritical water is maintained by an external force or its own high vapor pressure in an enclosed space.
2: As subcritical water has highly ionic characteristics and a low dielectric constant (), it is regarded as an excellent solvent for obtaining both hydrophobic and hydrophilic substances from botanical materials [ 7, 8, 9, 10].
3: In our recent studies, subcritical water demonstrated remarkable extraction efficiency for recovering total carbohydrate, protein, and phenolic contents from Japanese mint leaves within a 5 min treatment [ 11].
4: In the standard batch-wise extraction by subcritical water, mint essential oil is extracted along with dissolved substances, such as carbohydrates and proteins, necessitating additional separation operations for recovering the essential oil.
5: In order to minimize the effort and improve extraction efficiency, we have proposed a modified method, involving subcritical water treatment coupled with pressure-releasing distillation, to obtain essential oil from Japanese mint [ 12].
6: By employing this specialized method for the recovery of essential oil, we could avoid the step of separating the liquid from solid residue, and the highest total yield of 30.5 mg/g-dry leaves of essential oil was achieved with a rapid extraction time of 5 min at 180 C.
