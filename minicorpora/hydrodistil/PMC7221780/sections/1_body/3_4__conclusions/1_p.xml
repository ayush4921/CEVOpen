<p>Small-scale subcritical water treatment was performed in order to evaluate the thermal stability of four major mint-essential-oil components; showed an excellent throughput. Under various temperature and duration treatments (180–240 °C, 5–60 min), the order of thermal resistance was 
 <italic>l</italic>-menthyl acetate &gt; 
 <italic>l</italic>-menthol &gt; piperitone &gt; 
 <italic>l</italic>-menthone. For the 5 min subcritical water treatment at 180 °C, the degradation ratios of the four components were all below 3%. Regarding the treatment of individual components (240 °C, 60 min), conversion and hydrothermal decomposition were observed. The high thermal stability of Japanese mint essential oil was also observed when the treatment was carried out at 220 °C for 5 min under subcritical water condition. As summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-01953-f006">Figure 6</xref>, a portion of 
 <italic>l</italic>-menthyl acetate was consequently converted into 
 <italic>l</italic>-menthol, piperitone, and thymol. The decomposition of the four components and thymol had most likely occurred during or after the conversion. These results give insight into the degradation mechanism of mint essential oil components under subcritical water conditions, and provide the basis for optimizing extraction conditions of mint essential oils using subcritical water.
