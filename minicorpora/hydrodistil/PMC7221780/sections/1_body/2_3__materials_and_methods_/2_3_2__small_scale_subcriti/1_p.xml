<p>Ampoule bottles (AP-2, Maruemu, Osaka) were used for small-scale subcritical water treatment. An oil mixture was made by mixing the same amount of each of the four components (
 <italic>l</italic>-menthol, 
 <italic>l</italic>-menthone, piperitone, and 
 <italic>l</italic>-menthyl acetate). An aliquot (10 µL) of the mixture and distilled water (1.0 mL) were added to an ampoule bottle (2 mL, AP-2, As One, Osaka) using a pipette, and the ampoule bottle was then sealed using a gas burner. The sealed ampoule bottle was placed in a pressure-resistant SUS-316 stainless steel vessel (TVS-N2 type, Taiatsu Techno, Osaka) (

The internal volume of the vessel was 117 mL (3.0 cm i.d. × 16.6 cm height), and the maximum operation pressure and temperature of the vessel were 20 MPa and 260 °C, respectively. Distilled water (100 mL) was added to the vessel before the vessel was tightly fastened. A mantle heater (P5-2, Tokyo Garasu Kikai, Tokyo) equipped with a temperature regulator (TXN-700B, As One, Osaka) and a thermocouple (1.0 mm i.d. × 30.0 cm, K sheath 0–700 °C, As One, Osaka) were used for heating the vessel. To evaluate the thermal stability of the major components, the treatment temperatures were set at 180, 200, 220, and 240 °C, and the treatment times were set at 5, 10, 20, and 60 min. These treatment conditions were set based on the optimized treatment (180 °C, 5 min) proposed by our previous study [
