0: Ampoule bottles (AP-2, Maruemu, Osaka) were used for small-scale subcritical water treatment.
1: An oil mixture was made by mixing the same amount of each of the four components ( l-menthol,  l-menthone, piperitone, and  l-menthyl acetate).
2: An aliquot (10 L) of the mixture and distilled water (1.0 mL) were added to an ampoule bottle (2 mL, AP-2, As One, Osaka) using a pipette, and the ampoule bottle was then sealed using a gas burner.
3: The sealed ampoule bottle was placed in a pressure-resistant SUS-316 stainless steel vessel (TVS-N2 type, Taiatsu Techno, Osaka) ( Figure 5).
4: The internal volume of the vessel was 117 mL (3.0 cm i.d.
5: 16.6 cm height), and the maximum operation pressure and temperature of the vessel were 20 MPa and 260 C, respectively.
6: Distilled water (100 mL) was added to the vessel before the vessel was tightly fastened.
7: A mantle heater (P5-2, Tokyo Garasu Kikai, Tokyo) equipped with a temperature regulator (TXN-700B, As One, Osaka) and a thermocouple (1.0 mm i.d.
8: 30.0 cm, K sheath 0700 C, As One, Osaka) were used for heating the vessel.
9: To evaluate the thermal stability of the major components, the treatment temperatures were set at 180, 200, 220, and 240 C, and the treatment times were set at 5, 10, 20, and 60 min.
10: These treatment conditions were set based on the optimized treatment (180 C, 5 min) proposed by our previous study [ 11, 12].
11: Measurement of the treatment time commenced once the vessel had reached the desired temperature [ 13].
12: Phenol was used as an internal standard (I.S.)
13: in gas chromatography (GC) analysis.
14: Following treatment, the ampoule bottle was carefully opened and 1010 L of 2.0% ( w/v) phenol-acetone solution was added to the mixture.
15: The well-mixed sample was further diluted 10-fold with acetone before GC analysis.
