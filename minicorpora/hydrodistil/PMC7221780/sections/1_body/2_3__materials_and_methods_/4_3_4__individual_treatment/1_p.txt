0: In addition to the mixture, the components ( l-menthol,  l-menthone, piperitone, and  l-menthyl acetate) were individually treated by small-scale subcritical water treatment to investigate the possible mechanism of conversion and decomposition.
1: Ten microliters of  l-menthone, piperitone, or  l-menthyl acetate, or 10 mg of  l-menthol were individually added to an ampoule bottle ( Figure 5) filled with 1.0 mL of distilled water.
2: After sealing the bottle, the treatment was carried out at 240 C for 60 min.
3: After the treatment, the 2.0% ( w/v) of phenol-acetone solution was added (1010 L) to the sample.
4: The mixed sample was further diluted 10-fold with acetone before gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis.
