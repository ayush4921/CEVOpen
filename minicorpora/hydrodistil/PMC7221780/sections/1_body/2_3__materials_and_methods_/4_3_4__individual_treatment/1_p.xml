<p>In addition to the mixture, the components (
 <italic>l</italic>-menthol, 
 <italic>l</italic>-menthone, piperitone, and 
 <italic>l</italic>-menthyl acetate) were individually treated by small-scale subcritical water treatment to investigate the possible mechanism of conversion and decomposition. Ten microliters of 
 <italic>l</italic>-menthone, piperitone, or 
 <italic>l</italic>-menthyl acetate, or 10 mg of 
 <italic>l</italic>-menthol were individually added to an ampoule bottle (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-01953-f005">Figure 5</xref>) filled with 1.0 mL of distilled water. After sealing the bottle, the treatment was carried out at 240 °C for 60 min. After the treatment, the 2.0% (
 <italic>w/v</italic>) of phenol-acetone solution was added (1010 µL) to the sample. The mixed sample was further diluted 10-fold with acetone before gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis.
