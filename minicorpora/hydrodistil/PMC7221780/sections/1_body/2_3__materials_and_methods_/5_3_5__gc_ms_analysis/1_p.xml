<p>Qualitative analysis of the treated sample was carried out by GC-MS (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). As with the GC analysis, a TC-WAX capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., GL Science, Tokyo, Japan) was used in GC-MS analysis. The carrier gas used was helium gas, and the split-less mode was set at 4.0 mL/min. The temperatures of both injector and quadrupole were set at 250 °C, and the temperature of the ion source was set at 170 °C. The oven temperature program was set as follows: held at 100 °C for 20 min, increased to 240 °C at 40 °C/min, and held at 240 °C for 5 min. A 1.0 µL aliquot of each sample was injected into the GC-MS in duplicate. The mass spectral library of NIST 14 was used for assigning the detected peaks.</p>
