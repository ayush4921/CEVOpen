0: Qualitative analysis of the treated sample was carried out by GC-MS (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).
1: As with the GC analysis, a TC-WAX capillary column (30 m  0.25 mm i.d., GL Science, Tokyo, Japan) was used in GC-MS analysis.
2: The carrier gas used was helium gas, and the split-less mode was set at 4.0 mL/min.
3: The temperatures of both injector and quadrupole were set at 250 C, and the temperature of the ion source was set at 170 C. The oven temperature program was set as follows: held at 100 C for 20 min, increased to 240 C at 40 C/min, and held at 240 C for 5 min.
4: A 1.0 L aliquot of each sample was injected into the GC-MS in duplicate.
5: The mass spectral library of NIST 14 was used for assigning the detected peaks.
