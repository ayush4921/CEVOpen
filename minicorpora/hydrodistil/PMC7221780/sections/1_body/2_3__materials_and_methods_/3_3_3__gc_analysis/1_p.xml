<p>A GC (Shimadzu, Kyoto) equipped with a TC-WAX capillary column (0.25 mm i.d. × 30.0 m; GL Science, Tokyo) was used for the quantification. Both the carrier gas and the make-up gas used were nitrogen gas. The total flow and purge flow were set 19.3 mL/min and 3 mL/min, respectively. The split ratio was set 20 to 1. Both the temperatures of the injector and FID detector were set to 250 °C. The program of oven temperature was set as follows: held at 50 °C for 3 min, increased to 110 °C at 15 °C/min, increased to 150 °C at 3 °C/min, increased to 200 °C at 15 °C/min, and held at 200 °C for 5 min. A 1.0 µL aliquot of each sample was injected into the GC in duplicate.</p>
