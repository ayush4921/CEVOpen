<p>In addition to the 60 min treatment described above, piperitone was further treated at 240 °C for 120 and 180 min, and GC analysis was conducted. The relative reference factor (RRF) between the samples and I.S. was evaluated. In order to confirm thermal stability of real mint essential oil, the Japanese mint essential oil described in
