Introduction</title><p>Mint essentials oils are well-known and popular products for their cooling and invigorating effects. Mint essential oils are generally obtained from Japanese mint (<italic>Mentha arvensis L.</italic>), peppermint (<italic>Mentha piperita, L.</italic>), and spearmint (<italic>Mentha spicata L.</italic>). <italic>l</italic>-Menthol is the most abundant component in the Japanese mint and peppermint essential oils, while <italic>l</italic>-carvone is the most abundant component in spearmint essential oil [<xref rid="B1-molecules-25-01953" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-molecules-25-01953" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Japanese mint essential oil is renowned for having a higher <italic>l</italic>-menthol content than that of peppermint essential oil, and the proportion of <italic>l</italic>-menthol in Japanese mint essential oil can exceed 70% [<xref rid="B3-molecules-25-01953" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Hydrodistillation is the most universal and conventional method for obtaining essential oil from mint [<xref rid="B4-molecules-25-01953" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, the drawback of this method is the time-consuming extraction. For example, hydrodistillation requires three hours for a batch extraction of rosemary essential oil [<xref rid="B5-molecules-25-01953" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. As a promising alternative, subcritical water treatment was reportedly more efficient than hydrodistillation in the extraction of marjoram essential oil [<xref rid="B6-molecules-25-01953" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. </p><p>Subcritical water is also known as hot pressured water, its temperature being above the boiling point (100 &#x000b0;C), and below the critical point (374 &#x000b0;C). The liquid state of subcritical water is maintained by an external force or its own high vapor pressure in an enclosed space. As subcritical water has highly ionic characteristics and a low dielectric constant (&#x003b5;), it is regarded as an excellent solvent for obtaining both hydrophobic and hydrophilic substances from botanical materials [<xref rid="B7-molecules-25-01953" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-molecules-25-01953" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-molecules-25-01953" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-molecules-25-01953" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In our recent studies, subcritical water demonstrated remarkable extraction efficiency for recovering total carbohydrate, protein, and phenolic contents from Japanese mint leaves within a 5 min treatment [<xref rid="B11-molecules-25-01953" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In the standard batch-wise extraction by subcritical water, mint essential oil is extracted along with dissolved substances, such as carbohydrates and proteins, necessitating additional separation operations for recovering the essential oil. In order to minimize the effort and improve extraction efficiency, we have proposed a modified method, involving subcritical water treatment coupled with pressure-releasing distillation, to obtain essential oil from Japanese mint [<xref rid="B12-molecules-25-01953" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. By employing this specialized method for the recovery of essential oil, we could avoid the step of separating the liquid from solid residue, and the highest total yield of 30.5 mg/g-dry leaves of essential oil was achieved with a rapid extraction time of 5 min at 180 &#x000b0;C. </p><p>The highly ionic characteristics and a low dielectric constant were regarded as pivotal for improving the extraction efficiency, however, the phenomena of conversion and decomposition of mint essential oil components were observed at higher extraction temperatures and extended extraction times during subcritical water treatment [<xref rid="B11-molecules-25-01953" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-molecules-25-01953" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Conversion and decomposition were considered to be the reason for loss of product during extraction. Thus far, materials subjected to subcritical water treatment have been natural products, and analysis of extract compositions has been too complicated. Therefore, the phenomena of conversion and decomposition have not been clarified. In order to further improve the extraction efficiency and reduce the loss of essential oil during subcritical water treatment, it is necessary to understand the mechanisms involved in conversion and decomposition of essential oil components under subcritical water conditions. The aim of this study is to investigate the possible mechanism of conversion and decomposition of the major components of mint essential oil during subcritical water treatment. The four major components, <italic>l</italic>-menthol, <italic>l</italic>-menthone, piperitone, and <italic>l</italic>-menthyl acetate, were subjected to subcritical water treatment, and the batch-wise method was employed. Moreover, in order to improve experimental throughput for measuring compound stabilities in subcritical water treatment, a small-scale technique utilizing ampoules was developed and employed. Since the optimized treatment condition was indicated to be 180 &#x000b0;C for 5 min in our previous study [<xref rid="B11-molecules-25-01953" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-molecules-25-01953" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], the longer treatment time and higher treatment temperature were examined in this study to further evaluate the thermal stability of the major components.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-molecules-25-01953"><title>2. Results and Discussion</title><sec id="sec2dot1-molecules-25-01953"><title>2.1. Degradation of the Components by Subcritical Water Treatment</title><p>Small-scale subcritical water treatment of the four components (<italic>l</italic>-menthol, <italic>l</italic>-menthone, piperitone, and <italic>l</italic>-menthyl acetate) with an excellent throughput was successfully performed in batch mode. Each treatment was conducted on 10 &#x000b5;L of sample. The results of the treatments at 180&#x02013;240 &#x000b0;C for 5&#x02013;60 min are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-01953-f001">Figure 1</xref>. Following GC analysis of the sample, the residual ratio was estimated by considering peak areas of the components. The results indicated that the residual ratio of <italic>l</italic>-menthol decreased to 89.3% at 180 &#x000b0;C after 60 min. In the same 60 min treatment, the ratio of <italic>l</italic>-menthol further decreased to 81.6% when the temperature was increased to 240 &#x000b0;C. As <italic>l</italic>-menthyl acetate maintained its residual ratio above 90% after treatment at 240 &#x000b0;C for 60 min, <italic>l</italic>-menthyl acetate was clearly more heat resistant compared to <italic>l</italic>-menthol. In the 60 min treatment, the residual ratio of <italic>l</italic>-menthone was 94.7% at 180 &#x000b0;C, decreasing to 82.2%, 71.3%, and 62.1% as the temperature increased to 200, 220, and 240 &#x000b0;C, respectively. That is, <italic>l</italic>-menthone was the most temperature sensitive among the four components. Piperitone exhibited moderate heat resistance. The residual ratio of piperitone was 89.9% at 180 &#x000b0;C in the 60 min treatment, and it decreased to 73.4% as the temperature was increased to 240 &#x000b0;C.</p><p>In our previous study, excellent yields of <italic>l</italic>-menthol and <italic>l</italic>-menthone could be obtained from Japanese mint leaves at 180 &#x000b0;C within 5 min. In this study, the residual ratios of <italic>l</italic>-menthol, <italic>l</italic>-menthone, <italic>l</italic>-menthyl acetate, and piperitone were 99.5%, 99.2%, 97.7%, and 99.3%, respectively, under the same treatment conditions (180 &#x000b0;C, 5 min). That is, subcritical water did not lead to significant loss of Japanese mint essential oil under optimal extraction conditions (180 &#x000b0;C, 5 min) [<xref rid="B12-molecules-25-01953" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-molecules-25-01953"><title>2.2. Individual Component Treatments</title><p>Individual treatments of <italic>l</italic>-menthol, <italic>l</italic>-menthyl acetate, <italic>l</italic>-menthone, and piperitone were performed at 240 &#x000b0;C for 60 min, and the results before and after the treatments are shown as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-01953-f002">Figure 2</xref>a&#x02013;d, respectively. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-01953-f002">Figure 2</xref>a, <italic>l</italic>-menthol exhibited a retention time of approximately 9.52 min, and the shoulder peak was ascribed to a stereoisomer of menthol, based on the GC-MS result. However, to simplify the discussion, the stereoisomer was not considered thereafter in this study. Following the treatment, the peak area of <italic>l</italic>-menthol decreased, while the peaks of menthone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-01953-f002">Figure 2</xref>a, left inserted figure) and piperitone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-01953-f002">Figure 2</xref>a, right inserted figure) appeared. <italic>l</italic>-Menthyl acetate gave rise to a peak with a retention time of approximately 6.64 min, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-01953-f002">Figure 2</xref>b. Analogous to <italic>l</italic>-menthol, <italic>l</italic>-menthyl acetate exhibited a shoulder peak close to the main peak, which was likewise attributed to a stereoisomer of menthyl acetate. The inset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-01953-f002">Figure 2</xref>b indicated that the peak corresponding to <italic>l</italic>-menthol appeared after the treatment of <italic>l</italic>-menthyl acetate. The results suggest that the ester bond of <italic>l</italic>-menthyl acetate was hydrolyzed by subcritical water, and <italic>l</italic>-menthyl acetate was thereby converted into <italic>l</italic>-menthol. As the <italic>l</italic>-menthol peak was small, this indicated that it was likely immediately further degraded. The produced acetic acid was most probably responsible for accelerating the degradation by increasing ionic products under subcritical water conditions. Prior to treatment, <italic>l</italic>-menthone had a retention time of 4.50 min, while two shoulders appeared at 4.29 and 5.00 min, as evident in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-01953-f002">Figure 2</xref>c. After the treatment, one major peak (4.50 min) and three shoulders (4.27, 4.78, 5.00 min) were detected. According to the results of GC-MS, the three shoulders were all stereoisomers of <italic>l</italic>-menthone. The shoulders at 4.78 and 5.00 min became more prominent after the subcritical water treatment. These results suggested that the rearrangement reactions of menthone occurred under subcritical water conditions. In the right-hand inset of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-01953-f002">Figure 2</xref>c, a peak at 13.47 min is evident, which was concluded to arise from piperitone. That is, in addition to the rearrangement reactions, the conversion of <italic>l</italic>-menthone to piperitone also occurred under subcritical water conditions. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-01953-f002">Figure 2</xref>d, the piperitone peak appeared at 13.61 min, and its peak area decreased following subcritical water treatment. A noted peak with a retention time of 23.54 min showed a large increase after the treatment, and was identified as thymol based on the mass spectral library of NIST 14 with a possibility of 60.2%. A peak at 24.56 min was identified as 1-isocyanonaphthalene with a possibility of 62.7%, which would be inaccurately assigned as a cyano derivative, that is, the origin of nitrogen was uncertain. Moreover, since all the other minority peaks was also never assigned with low possibility (below 30%) based on the mass spectral library. According to these results, piperitone was likely oxidized, and then converted to thymol under subcritical water conditions. </p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-molecules-25-01953"><title>2.3. Conversion of Piperitone to Thymol</title><p>To further investigate the conversion of piperitone to thymol, a small-scale subcritical water treatment of piperitone was carried out at 240 &#x000b0;C for 60, 120, and 180 min, and the results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-01953-f003">Figure 3</xref>. The relative reference factors (RRFs) of piperitone and thymol to phenol were 1.02 &#x000b1; 0.08 and 1.69 &#x000b1; 0.08, respectively. The amount of piperitone decreased as the treatment time increased, decreasing to 0.51% (<italic>w/w</italic>) within 180 min. Approximately 0.03% (<italic>w/w</italic>) thymol was generated at 60 min; however, the concentration of thymol remained the same when the treatment time was extended to 120 min or to 180 min. It was therefore considered that thymol decomposed rapidly once it was generated from piperitone under subcritical water conditions at 240 &#x000b0;C. However, detailed elucidation of the mechanism and kinetics requires further investigation.</p><p>To investigate the reaction occurred in natural material, Japanese mint essential oil was treated at 220 &#x000b0;C for 5 min and the results compared with untreated sample are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-01953-f004">Figure 4</xref>. The peak of menthol decreased approximately 7.5% based on the peak area (adjusted by internal standard), and this result was consistent with the result shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-01953-f003">Figure 3</xref>. The peak area of menthyl acetate decreased approximately 3.7%, which was lower than that of piperitone (9.8%). This result was also consistent with the result in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-01953-f003">Figure 3</xref> for that menthyl acetate had higher thermal stability than piperitone under subcritical water condition. Since the peak of thymol increased approximately 13.1% after 5 min treatment at 220 &#x000b0;C, Japanese mint essential oil, as a natural material, was considered to have similar thermal decomposition characteristics to the standard reagents even the composition ratio of menthol in the oil was over 70% [<xref rid="B12-molecules-25-01953" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3-molecules-25-01953"><title>3.

These treatment conditions were set based on the optimized treatment (180 &#x000b0;C, 5 min) proposed by our previous study [<xref rid="B11-molecules-25-01953" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-molecules-25-01953" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Measurement of the treatment time commenced once the vessel had reached the desired temperature [<xref rid="B13-molecules-25-01953" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Phenol was used as an internal standard (I.S.) in gas chromatography (GC) analysis. Following treatment, the ampoule bottle was carefully opened and 1010 &#x000b5;L of 2.0% (<italic>w/v</italic>) phenol-acetone solution was added to the mixture. The well-mixed sample was further diluted 10-fold with acetone before GC analysis.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-molecules-25-01953"><title>3.3.

Both the carrier gas and the make-up gas used were nitrogen gas. The total flow and purge flow were set 19.3 mL/min and 3 mL/min, respectively. The split ratio was set 20 to 1. Both the temperatures of the injector and FID detector were set to 250 &#x000b0;C.

Conclusions</title><p>Small-scale subcritical water treatment was performed in order to evaluate the thermal stability of four major mint-essential-oil components; showed an excellent throughput. Under various temperature and duration treatments (180&#x02013;240 &#x000b0;C, 5&#x02013;60 min), the order of thermal resistance was <italic>l</italic>-menthyl acetate &#x0003e; <italic>l</italic>-menthol &#x0003e; piperitone &#x0003e; <italic>l</italic>-menthone. For the 5 min subcritical water treatment at 180 &#x000b0;C, the degradation ratios of the four components were all below 3%. Regarding the treatment of individual components (240 &#x000b0;C, 60 min), conversion and hydrothermal decomposition were observed. The high thermal stability of Japanese mint essential oil was also observed when the treatment was carried out at 220 &#x000b0;C for 5 min under subcritical water condition. As summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-01953-f006">Figure 6</xref>, a portion of <italic>l</italic>-menthyl acetate was consequently converted into <italic>l</italic>-menthol, piperitone, and thymol. The decomposition of the four components and thymol had most likely occurred during or after the conversion. These results give insight into the degradation mechanism of mint essential oil components under subcritical water conditions, and provide the basis for optimizing extraction conditions of mint essential oils using subcritical water.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was supported by the Research Center for Okhotsk Agriculture-, Forestry- and Fisheries-Engineering Collaboration (CAFF&#x000c8;).</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Sample Availability:</bold> Samples of the compounds are not available from the authors.</p></fn></fn-group><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Writing&#x02014;original draft preparation, T.-Y.C.; formal analysis and data curation, T.-Y.C., S.N.; writing&#x02014;review and editing, M.K., C.-S.L., W.-J.L. and T.-Y.T.; resources, Y.S. and Y.K.; supervision, M.M., N.O., Y.N. and T.S.
