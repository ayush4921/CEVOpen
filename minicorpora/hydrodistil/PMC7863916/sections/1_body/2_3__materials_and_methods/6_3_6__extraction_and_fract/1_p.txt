0: The extraction was performed on freeze-dried sample at a room temperature with a mixture of solvents methanol (MeOH)/dichloromethane (DCM) (1:1,  v/ v) with the solvent:solid ratio 10 mL/g, three times for 5 min; each time with sonication (ultrasound-bath Elma, Elmasonic P 70 H, 37 kHz/50 W, Singen, Germany) and gravity filtration.
1: The obtained extract was mixed with C18 powder (Macherey-Nagel Polygoprep 60-50 C18, 4063 m, FisherScientific, Massachusetts, USA) and the mixture was subjected to evaporation under nitrogen (5.0, Messer, Croatia) to remove the organic solvent.
2: The dry extract mixed with C18 powder was then placed on the SPE cartridge (C18, 1 g, 6 mL, 40 m; Agilent Bond Elut, Waldbronn, Germany), which was conditioned with MeOH and ultrapure H 2O.
3: The sample was eluted using the solvents of decreasing polarity: (F1) H 2O, (F2) H 2O/MeOH (1:1,  v/ v), (F3) MeOH and (F4) MeOH/DCM (1:1,  v/ v) (using 12 mL of each solvent).
4: The water soluble components were eluted in F1 and F2 leading to better purification of the extract and obtaining higher amounts of compounds of interest (i.e., pigments) in F3 and F4.
5: Fractions F3 and F4 were dried using SpeedVac (SPD1030, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and stored at 4 C in the dark prior to the analysis.
6: The fractionation was performed in triplicates.
7: Furthermore, less polar fractions F3 and F4 were used for pigment determination and for antimicrobial and antioxidant activities.
