<p>Hydrodistillation was performed in a modified Clevenger apparatus for 2 h with the use of 1 mL of solvent trap (pentane:diethyl ether 1:2 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>). The fresh and air-dried samples (10 g; cut into small pieces) were used separately for the hydrodistillation. The volatile oil dissolved in the solvent trap was removed with a pipette, passed through the layer of MgSO
 <sub>4</sub> in a small glass funnel and carefully concentrated by the slow flow of nitrogen until the volume of 0.2 mL. The hydrodistillation was performed in triplicate. 2 μL were used for GC-FID and GC–MS analyses.
