0: Hydrodistillation was performed in a modified Clevenger apparatus for 2 h with the use of 1 mL of solvent trap (pentane:diethyl ether 1:2  v/ v).
1: The fresh and air-dried samples (10 g; cut into small pieces) were used separately for the hydrodistillation.
2: The volatile oil dissolved in the solvent trap was removed with a pipette, passed through the layer of MgSO 4 in a small glass funnel and carefully concentrated by the slow flow of nitrogen until the volume of 0.2 mL.
3: The hydrodistillation was performed in triplicate.
4: 2 L were used for GC-FID and GCMS analyses.
