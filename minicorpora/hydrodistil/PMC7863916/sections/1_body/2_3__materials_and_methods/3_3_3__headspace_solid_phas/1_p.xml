<p>Headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) was performed with a manual SPME holder using two fibers covered with PDMS/DVB (polydimethylsiloxane/divinylbenzene, 65 μm) or DVB/CAR/PDMS (divinylbenzene/carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane, 50/30 μm). The fibers were conditioned prior to the extraction according to Supelco Co. Prepared samples (1 g) were placed separately in 5 mL glass vials and hermetically sealed with PTFE/silicone septa. The vials were maintained in a water bath at 60 °C during equilibration (15 min) and HS-SPME (45 min). After the sampling, the SPME fiber was withdrawn into the needle, removed from the vial and inserted into the injector (250 °C) of GC-FID and GC–MS for 6 min for thermal desorption directly to the GC column. The procedure was similar as in previous papers [
