0: Headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) was performed with a manual SPME holder using two fibers covered with PDMS/DVB (polydimethylsiloxane/divinylbenzene, 65 m) or DVB/CAR/PDMS (divinylbenzene/carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane, 50/30 m).
1: The fibers were conditioned prior to the extraction according to Supelco Co.
2: Prepared samples (1 g) were placed separately in 5 mL glass vials and hermetically sealed with PTFE/silicone septa.
3: The vials were maintained in a water bath at 60 C during equilibration (15 min) and HS-SPME (45 min).
4: After the sampling, the SPME fiber was withdrawn into the needle, removed from the vial and inserted into the injector (250 C) of GC-FID and GCMS for 6 min for thermal desorption directly to the GC column.
5: The procedure was similar as in previous papers [ 21, 22, 23].
6: HS-SPME was done in triplicate.
