0: The FolinCiocalteu method was used for the total phenolic content (TPC) measurement [ 85] with some adaptations.
1: Briefly, 100 L extract was mixed with 750 L of FolinCiocalteu reagent (previously diluted tenfold with distilled water) and allowed to stand at room temperature for 5 min.
2: Next, 750 L sodium bicarbonate solution (60 g L 1) was added to the mixture.
3: After incubation for 90 min at room temperature, the absorbance was measured at 750 nm.
4: Total phenolic content was calibrated against gallic acid standard and expressed as mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE) per g of biomass.
