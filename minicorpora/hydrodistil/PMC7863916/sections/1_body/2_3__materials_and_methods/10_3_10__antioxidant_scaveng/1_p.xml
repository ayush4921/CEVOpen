<p>Obtained dry residues for F3 and F4 were dissolved in a proper solvent, following the polarity of fractions. Used solvent for fraction F3 was MeOH, while DMSO was used for F4. The stock concentration was highly dependable on the obtained mass of fractions, so the samples F3 and F4 were prepared at maximum concentration of 5 mg mL
 <sup>âˆ’1</sup>. Afterward, proper dilutions for each sample were made.
