<p>For measuring the radical absorbance capacity, the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay as described by Huang et al. [
 <xref rid="B87-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] was used with slight modification. Different concentrations of each fraction were prepared using appropriate solvent MeOH for F3, and DMSO for F4, because different activity was expected for each fraction. A fixed volume of 25 μL of the diluted samples was loaded in black 96-well flat bottom plates. The same amount of trolox (6.25–100 μM) and solvents were used in the plates as standard and blanks, respectively. Then 150 μL of 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) solution (1:500,

Then 25 μL AAPH (2,2-Azobis (2-methylpropionamidine) dihydrochloride, 75.3 mM) was added to the mixture to start the reaction and the fluorescence was recorded every 10 min for 16 h (overnight kinetic cycle). Samples were assayed at an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 528 nm with optimal fluorescence gain of 188. The oxygen radical absorbance capacity of the samples was expressed as μmol TE g
