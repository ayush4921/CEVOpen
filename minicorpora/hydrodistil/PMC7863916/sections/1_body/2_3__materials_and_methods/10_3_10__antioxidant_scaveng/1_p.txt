0: Obtained dry residues for F3 and F4 were dissolved in a proper solvent, following the polarity of fractions.
1: Used solvent for fraction F3 was MeOH, while DMSO was used for F4.
2: The stock concentration was highly dependable on the obtained mass of fractions, so the samples F3 and F4 were prepared at maximum concentration of 5 mg mL 1.
3: Afterward, proper dilutions for each sample were made.
