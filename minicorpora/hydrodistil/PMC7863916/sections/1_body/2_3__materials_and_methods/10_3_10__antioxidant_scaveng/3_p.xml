<p>The Folin–Ciocalteu method was used for the total phenolic content (TPC) measurement [
 <xref rid="B85-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>] with some adaptations. Briefly, 100 μL extract was mixed with 750 μL of Folin–Ciocalteu reagent (previously diluted tenfold with distilled water) and allowed to stand at room temperature for 5 min. Next, 750 μL sodium bicarbonate solution (60 g L
 <sup>−1</sup>) was added to the mixture. After incubation for 90 min at room temperature, the absorbance was measured at 750 nm. Total phenolic content was calibrated against gallic acid standard and expressed as mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE) per g of biomass.
