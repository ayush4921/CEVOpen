0: For measuring the radical absorbance capacity, the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay as described by Huang et al.
1: [ 87] was used with slight modification.
2: Different concentrations of each fraction were prepared using appropriate solvent MeOH for F3, and DMSO for F4, because different activity was expected for each fraction.
3: A fixed volume of 25 L of the diluted samples was loaded in black 96-well flat bottom plates.
4: The same amount of trolox (6.25100 M) and solvents were used in the plates as standard and blanks, respectively.
5: Then 150 L of 2,7-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) solution (1:500,  v/ v in 25 mL 75 mM PBS) was added and the mixture was incubated at 37 C for 30 min in an incubator with shaking (New Brunswick, Innova 42).
6: Then 25 L AAPH (2,2-Azobis (2-methylpropionamidine) dihydrochloride, 75.3 mM) was added to the mixture to start the reaction and the fluorescence was recorded every 10 min for 16 h (overnight kinetic cycle).
7: Samples were assayed at an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 528 nm with optimal fluorescence gain of 188.
8: The oxygen radical absorbance capacity of the samples was expressed as mol TE g 1 of fraction.
