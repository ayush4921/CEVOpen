0: The antioxidant capacity was measured by two assays (ORAC and ABTS).
1: For the implementation of the ABTS method and for comparison purposes, the traditional ABTS + radical-cation discoloration assay was used by means of spectroscopy at 734 nm [ 86].
2: The ABTS + stock solution was prepared from a 7 mM ABTS (diammonium salt of 2,2-azino- bis (3-ethylbenzthiazolin-6-yl) sulfonic acid) with 2.45 mM of potassium persulfate dissolved in 5 mL of distilled water, allowed to react during 17 h at room temperature in the absence of light.
3: The working solution of the already preformed ABTS + radical-cation was diluted with ethanol to achieve absorbance of 0.700  0.02.
4: The reaction mixture comprised of sample and ABTS + solution resulted in an inhibition between 20 and 80% of the blank of measurement.
5: The blank was represented by used solvent for each fraction.
6: Results were expressed in mg TE g 1 of fraction since trolox was used as an antioxidant standard.
