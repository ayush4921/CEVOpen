<p>The antioxidant capacity was measured by two assays (ORAC and ABTS). For the implementation of the ABTS method and for comparison purposes, the traditional ABTS
 <sup>+•</sup> radical-cation discoloration assay was used by means of spectroscopy at 734 nm [
 <xref rid="B86-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. The ABTS
 <sup>+•</sup> stock solution was prepared from a 7 mM ABTS (diammonium salt of 2,2′-azino- bis (3-ethylbenzthiazolin-6-yl) sulfonic acid) with 2.45 mM of potassium persulfate dissolved in 5 mL of distilled water, allowed to react during 17 h at room temperature in the absence of light. The working solution of the already preformed ABTS
 <sup>+•</sup> radical-cation was diluted with ethanol to achieve absorbance of 0.700 ± 0.02. The reaction mixture comprised of sample and ABTS
 <sup>+•</sup> solution resulted in an inhibition between 20 and 80% of the blank of measurement. The blank was represented by used solvent for each fraction. Results were expressed in mg TE g
 <sup>−1</sup> of fraction since trolox was used as an antioxidant standard.
