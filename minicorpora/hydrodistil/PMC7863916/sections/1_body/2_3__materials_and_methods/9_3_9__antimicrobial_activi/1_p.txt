0: The semipurified fractions (F3 and F4) were tested for antimicrobial activity using disk diffusion for qualitative and broth microdilution methods for quantitative assessment according to the CLSI guidelines [ 82, 83] with minor modifications.
1: All stock solutions were made at 20 mg mL 1 ( w/ v), where dry residues of F3 and F4 were diluted in the appropriate solvent.
2: F3 was dissolved in MeOH and 50% ( v/ v) DMSO, while F4 was dissolved in 50% ( v/ v) DMSO.
3: These stock solutions were diluted with distilled H 2O to working solutions of 4 mg mL 1 ( w/ v), which were used for disk diffusion (120 g/disc) tests using MuellerHinton agar for bacteria and YPD agar prepared from YPD broth supplemented with 1.5% ( w/ v) bacteriological agar for fungi.
4: These working solutions were then further diluted with culture media broths (cation-adjusted MuellerHinton broth for bacteria and YPD broth for fungi) to 4000.78 g mL 1 ( w/ v) as final concentrations used in broth microdilution tests.
5: All tests were performed on two independent occasions each time in technical duplicates.
6: Each experimental run included the solvent control at the concentration corresponding to the samples (20% ( v/ v) MeOH and 10% ( v/ v) DMSO in disk diffusion and 2% ( v/ v) MeOH and 1% ( v/ v) DMSO in broth microdilution tests) and an antimicrobial agent norfloxacin for bacteria and nystatin for fungi.
7: Broth microdilution tests additionally employed a positive growth control (drug- and sample-free wells) and a negative sterility control (wells with culture media only).
8: The bacterial panel consisted of Gram negative ( Escherichia coli NCTC 12,241 and  Pseudomonas aeruginosa NCTC 12903) and Gram positive ( Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 and  Bacillus subtilis subsp.
9: spizizenii ATCC 6633) indicator species and the fungal panel of  Candida albicans ATCC 90,028 yeast and  Fusarium oxysporum f. sp.
10: lagenariae JCM 9293 mold species.
11: All tests were performed in aerobic atmosphere at 35 C. In addition, field isolates of  Listonella ( Vibrio)  anguillarum,  Photobacterium damselae subsp.
12: damselae and  P. damselae subsp.
13: piscicida isolated from diseased fish were tested by the disk diffusion method only.
14: For these aquatic bacteria grown also aerobically but at 28 C on Zobell Marine agar, the antimicrobial quality control range of  E. coli NCTC 12,241 for florfenicol was used according to Miller et al.
15: [ 84].
