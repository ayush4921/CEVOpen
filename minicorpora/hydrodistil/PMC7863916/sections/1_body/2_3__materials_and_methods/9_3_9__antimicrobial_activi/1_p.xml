<p>The semipurified fractions (F3 and F4) were tested for antimicrobial activity using disk diffusion for qualitative and broth microdilution methods for quantitative assessment according to the CLSI guidelines [

 <italic>v</italic>) as final concentrations used in broth microdilution tests. All tests were performed on two independent occasions each time in technical duplicates. Each experimental run included the solvent control at the concentration corresponding to the samples (20% (
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) MeOH and 10% (
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) DMSO in disk diffusion and 2% (

 <italic>v</italic>) MeOH and 1% (
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) DMSO in broth microdilution tests) and an antimicrobial agent norfloxacin for bacteria and nystatin for fungi. Broth microdilution tests additionally employed a positive growth control (drug- and sample-free wells) and a negative sterility control (wells with culture media only). The bacterial panel consisted of Gram negative (
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> NCTC 12,241 and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> NCTC 12903) and Gram positive (
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> ATCC 6538 and 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>spizizenii</italic> ATCC 6633) indicator species and the fungal panel of 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> ATCC 90,028 yeast and 
 <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> f. sp. 
 <italic>lagenariae</italic> JCM 9293 mold species. All tests were performed in aerobic atmosphere at 35 °C. In addition, field isolates of 
 <italic>Listonella</italic> (
 <italic>Vibrio</italic>) 
 <italic>anguillarum</italic>, 
 <italic>Photobacterium damselae</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>damselae</italic> and 
 <italic>P. damselae</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>piscicida</italic> isolated from diseased fish were tested by the disk diffusion method only. For these aquatic bacteria grown also aerobically but at 28 °C on Zobell Marine agar, the antimicrobial quality control range of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> NCTC 12,241 for florfenicol was used according to Miller et al. [
