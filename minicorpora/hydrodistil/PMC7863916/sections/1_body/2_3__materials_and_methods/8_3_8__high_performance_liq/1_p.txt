0: HPLC system, Agilent 1100 Series HPLC System (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) equipped with binary pump, autosampler, column heater and variable wavelength detector (VWD) was used for the separation, identification and quantification of chlorophylls and carotenoids from F3 and F4 obtained by SPE according to modified method by Castro-Puyana et al.
1: [ 81].
2: Briefly, the YMC-C30 reversed phase column (250 mm  4.6mm id, 5 m particle size, YMC Europe, Schernbeck, Germany) was used and the mobile phases were: the mixture of MeOH:isopropanol:H 2O (90:7:3,  v/ v/ v) (A) and MeOH:isopropanol (10:90,  v/ v) (B) eluted according to the following gradient: 0 min, 0% B; 50 min, 100% B and 60 min, 0% B.
3: The flow rate was 050 min, 0.60.8 mL/min and 5060 min, 0.8 mL/min, the injection volume was 30 L and detection was at 450 nm (recorded spectra from 350 to 660 nm by VWD).
4: The identification of carotenoids and chlorophylls was carried out by comparing retention times and spectral data of separated peaks with those of standards and the quantification of pigments was performed by the external standard method.
5: For the calibration curve, standard solutions of -carotene (linearity R 2 = 0.99189), -carotene (linearity R 2 = 0.98610), chlorophyll  a (linearity R 2 = 0.99934), lutein (linearity R 2 = 0.99630) and fucoxanthin (linearity R 2 = 0.99967) were prepared by the appropriate dilution of stocks of each standard in acetone.
6: The analyses were performed in triplicates.
7: The results in  Table 4 were calculated as mean values  standard deviation (SD) and expressed as mg g 1 of the dry fraction.
