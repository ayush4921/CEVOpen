0: Gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GCMS) analyses were done on an Agilent Technologies (Palo Alto, CA, USA) gas chromatograph model 7890A equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a HP-5MS capillary column (5% phenyl-methylpolysiloxane, Agilent J and W).
1: The GC conditions were the same as described previously [ 21, 22, 23].
2: In brief, the injector and detector temperatures were 250 C and 300 C, the oven temperature was set up isothermal at 70 C for 2 min, then increased from 70 to 200 C at 3 C min 1, and held isothermally at 200 C for 15 min; split ratio was 1:50; carrier gas was helium (He at flow rate 1.0 mL min 1).
3: The GCMS analyses were done on an Agilent Technologies (Palo Alto, CA, USA) gas chromatograph model 7820A equipped with a mass selective detector (MSD) model 5977E (Agilent Technologies) and HP-5MS capillary column (30 m  0.25 mm, 0.25 m film thickness, Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA), under the same conditions as for the GC-FID analysis.
4: The MSD (EI mode) was operated at 70 eV, and the mass range was 30300 amu.
