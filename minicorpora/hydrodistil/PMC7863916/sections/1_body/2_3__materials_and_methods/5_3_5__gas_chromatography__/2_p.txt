0: The identification of the compounds was based on the comparison of their retention indices (RI), determined relative to the retention times of  n-alkanes (C 9C 25), with those reported in the literature (National Institute of Standards and Technology [ 78]) and their mass spectra with the spectra from Wiley 9 (Wiley, New York, NY, USA) and NIST 17 (D-Gaithersburg) mass spectral libraries.
1: The percentage composition of the samples was computed using the normalization method (without correction factors).
2: The average component percentages in  Table 1 and  Table 2 were calculated from GC-FID and GCMS analyses of three replicates.
