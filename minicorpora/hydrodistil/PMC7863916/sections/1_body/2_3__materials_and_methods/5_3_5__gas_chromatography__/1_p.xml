<p>Gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC–MS) analyses were done on an Agilent Technologies (Palo Alto, CA, USA) gas chromatograph model 7890A equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a HP-5MS capillary column (5% phenyl-methylpolysiloxane, Agilent J and W). The GC conditions were the same as described previously [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In brief, the injector and detector temperatures were 250 °C and 300 °C, the oven temperature was set up isothermal at 70 °C for 2 min, then increased from 70 to 200 °C at 3 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup>, and held isothermally at 200 °C for 15 min; split ratio was 1:50; carrier gas was helium (He at flow rate 1.0 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup>). The GC–MS analyses were done on an Agilent Technologies (Palo Alto, CA, USA) gas chromatograph model 7820A equipped with a mass selective detector (MSD) model 5977E (Agilent Technologies) and HP-5MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm film thickness, Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA), under the same conditions as for the GC-FID analysis. The MSD (EI mode) was operated at 70 eV, and the mass range was 30–300 amu.
