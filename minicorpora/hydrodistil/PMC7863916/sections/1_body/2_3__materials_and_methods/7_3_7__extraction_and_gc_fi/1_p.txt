0: Extraction of total lipids from  A. rigida was performed by the Folch method [ 79].
1: Briefly, 1.00 g of the sample was mixed with 20 mL DCM/MeOH (2:1  v/ v) solvent mixture.
2: The mixture was stirred for 20 min at 400 rpm (IKA, KS 260 Basic, Staufen, Germany), filtered and then washed with 4 mL of 0.9% NaCl solution.
3: The upper phase was removed, and lower chloroform phase containing lipids was evaporated in a rotary evaporator (Laborota 4010, Heidolph Instruments GmbH & Co. KG, Schwabach, Germany) at 60 C. The samples were then dried in an oven (105 C until constant weight).
4: The extraction was performed in three repetitions.
5: Afterwards, the fatty acids methyl esters (FAMEs) were prepared with cold methanolic potassium hydroxide solution according to the procedure described in Annex X B of the Commission Regulation No 796/2002 [ 80].
6: FAMEs were afterwards separated on a Shimadzu GC-2010 Plus gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and fitted with a SH-Rtx-Wax capillary column (30 m, 0.25 mm i.d.
7: and 0.25 m thick stationary phase).
8: Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas, flowing at the constant linear velocity of 1.33 mL min 1.
9: The split/splitless injector was set at 250 C, split ratio was 1:10, and the injection volume 2 L. Initial column temperature of 110 C was held for 2 min, then gradually increased 10 C min 1 until temperature of 175 C that was hold for 8 min, followed by gradual increase 5 C min 1 until 210 C held for 5 min, and a temperature increase to a final temperature of 230 C by a rate of 5 C min 1.
10: Final temperature was held for 7 min.
11: Total analysis time was 42.5 min.
12: Flame ionization detector temperature was 300 C. Hydrogen flow rate was 40 mL min 1, air flow rate 400 mL min 1 and make-up gas (nitrogen) flow was 30 mL min 1.
13: Identification of separated FAMEs in samples was achieved based on the comparison of retention times with the retention times of certified reference standard (Supelco F.A.M.E.
14: Mix, C 4C 24) analyzed under the same conditions.
15: The results were expressed as the percentage of identified fatty acid on total fatty acids (%).
