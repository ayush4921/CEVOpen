<p>Extraction of total lipids from

 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) solvent mixture. The mixture was stirred for 20 min at 400 rpm (IKA, KS 260 Basic, Staufen, Germany), filtered and then washed with 4 mL of 0.9% NaCl solution. The upper phase was removed, and lower chloroform phase containing lipids was evaporated in a rotary evaporator (Laborota 4010, Heidolph Instruments GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Schwabach, Germany) at 60 °C. The samples were then dried in an oven (105 °C until constant weight). The extraction was performed in three repetitions. Afterwards, the fatty acids methyl esters (FAMEs) were prepared with cold methanolic potassium hydroxide solution according to the procedure described in Annex X B of the Commission Regulation No 796/2002 [
 <xref rid="B80-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. FAMEs were afterwards separated on a Shimadzu GC-2010 Plus gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and fitted with a SH-Rtx-Wax capillary column (30 m, 0.25 mm i.d. and 0.25 µm thick stationary phase). Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas, flowing at the constant linear velocity of 1.33 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup>. The split/splitless injector was set at 250 °C, split ratio was 1:10, and the injection volume 2 µL. Initial column temperature of 110 °C was held for 2 min, then gradually increased 10 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup> until temperature of 175 °C that was hold for 8 min, followed by gradual increase 5 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup> until 210 °C held for 5 min, and a temperature increase to a final temperature of 230 °C by a rate of 5 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup>. Final temperature was held for 7 min. Total analysis time was 42.5 min. Flame ionization detector temperature was 300 °C. Hydrogen flow rate was 40 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup>, air flow rate 400 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup> and make-up gas (nitrogen) flow was 30 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup>. Identification of separated FAMEs in samples was achieved based on the comparison of retention times with the retention times of certified reference standard (Supelco F.A.M.E. Mix, C
 <sub>4</sub>–C
 <sub>24</sub>) analyzed under the same conditions. The results were expressed as the percentage of identified fatty acid on total fatty acids (%).
