0: Furthermore, for the extraction of fatty acids and pigments performed by the procedures explained in  Section 3.6 and  Section 3.7, fresh  A. rigida was freeze-dried before the extractions.
1: For the freeze-drying experiment the sample was washed three times in demineralized water than it was cut in slices and frozen at 20 C for 24 h in an ultra-low freezer.
2: Three trays of frozen samples were placed in a laboratory freeze dryer (Martin Christ, Alpha 24 LSCplus, Osterode am Harz, Germany).
3: The freeze drying process was performed for 96 h under high vacuum (0.51.81 hPa) with primary and secondary drying temperatures of 20 C and 20 C, respectively.
4: Freeze-dried samples were further used for the determination of fatty acids and pigments content and for the evaluation of antimicrobial and antioxidant activities.
