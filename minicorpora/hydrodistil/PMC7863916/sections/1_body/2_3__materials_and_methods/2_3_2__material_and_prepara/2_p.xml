<p>Prior to HS-SPME and HD, the samples were kept in the dark at 4 Â°C and the extractions were performed within 48 h of the collection. The alga was cut into small pieces and the excess seawater was removed by placing it between filter paper layers for 2 min (the seawater was not removed completely) as was done in previous research [
