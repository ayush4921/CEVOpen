 <italic>A. rigida</italic> was freeze-dried before the extractions. For the freeze-drying experiment the sample was washed three times in demineralized water than it was cut in slices and frozen at −20 °C for 24 h in an ultra-low freezer. Three trays of frozen samples were placed in a laboratory freeze dryer (Martin Christ, Alpha 2–4 LSCplus, Osterode am Harz, Germany). The freeze drying process was performed for 96 h under high vacuum (0.5–1.81 hPa) with primary and secondary drying temperatures of −20 °C and 20 °C, respectively. Freeze-dried samples were further used for the determination of fatty acids and pigments content and for the evaluation of antimicrobial and antioxidant activities.
