0: In general, there are just a few papers on red alga  A. rigida.
1: Mostly taxonomic studies on  Amphiroa species were done [ 9, 10, 11, 12] and the morphological variability of  A. rigida was investigated [ 13, 14].
2: The external microscopic characters obtained with the scanning electron microscope (SEM) were illustrated: the organization of intergenicular surfaces; differentiation and superficial aspects of conceptacles and quantitative characters such as epithallial concavity diameter and variation in the thickness of calcification [ 14].
3: However, according to our best knowledge, there is only one recent phytochemical study on this alga reporting polysaccharides.
4: The novel polysaccharides from  A. rigida (ARPS) were extracted [ 15] by an ultrasonication disruption (USD) and the extraction conditions were optimized by response surface methodology (RSM) combined with BoxBehnken design (BBD).
5: Furthermore, ARPS exhibited great potential for in vitro antioxidant activity in DPPH (58.24%  0.65%) and diammonium salt of 2,2-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzthiazolin-6-yl) sulfonic acid (ABTS +) scavenging (52.23%  0.88%) activity and also showed good antibacterial activity against  Salmonella typhi.
6: In addition, ARPS can inhibit human breast cancer cells (MCF-7) [ 15].
7: Hence, there are some studies reporting activities of other species belonging to the genus  Amphiroa such as antioxidative and matrix metalloproteinase inhibitory effects of  A. dilatata [ 16], antimicrobial activity of unspeciated  Amphiroa algae [ 17] and antifungal and antibacterial activities of  A. bowerbankii and  A. ephedraea [ 18].
8: The fatty acids profiles are reported for  A. anceps [ 19] and  A. beauvoisii [ 20] with some differences among profiles but it may be due to the different geographical locations and diverse abiotic factors.
