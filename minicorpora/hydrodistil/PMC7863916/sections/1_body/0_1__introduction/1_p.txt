0: In marine ecosystems, algae can release a wide spectrum of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with ecological functions to increase the tolerance to abiotic stresses, transfer stress information to induce defense, play allelopathic roles or protect against the predators [ 1].
1: Macroalgae are known for their content of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) such as omega-3 fatty acids that are associated with the several biological activities and health benefits including antioxidant [ 2], antibacterial, antitumor and anti-inflammatory effects [ 3].
2: Red algae, especially species belonging to the order Corallinales, are rich in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) that is known as omega-3 essential fatty acid [ 4].
3: The pigments are characteristic for certain algal groups (Chlorophyta, Rhodophyta and Ochrophyta).
4: Red algae are known for their content of chlorophyll  a, lutein, zeaxanthin, -carotene and -carotene and phycobilin pigments that are responsible for red or pink color of this phylum and enable them to grow in deep waters [ 5].
5: Numerous studies discovered that carotenoids are known for their powerful antioxidant [ 2, 6], anticancer [ 7] and antibacterial activities [ 8].
