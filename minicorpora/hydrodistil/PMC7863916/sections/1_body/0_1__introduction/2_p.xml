<p>In general, there are just a few papers on red alga 
 <italic>A. rigida</italic>. Mostly taxonomic studies on 
 <italic>Amphiroa</italic> species were done [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and the morphological variability of 
 <italic>A. rigida</italic> was investigated [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The external microscopic characters obtained with the scanning electron microscope (SEM) were illustrated: the organization of intergenicular surfaces; differentiation and superficial aspects of conceptacles and quantitative characters such as epithallial concavity diameter and variation in the thickness of calcification [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, according to our best knowledge, there is only one recent phytochemical study on this alga reporting polysaccharides. The novel polysaccharides from 
 <italic>A. rigida</italic> (ARPS) were extracted [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] by an ultrasonication disruption (USD) and the extraction conditions were optimized by response surface methodology (RSM) combined with Box–Behnken design (BBD). Furthermore, ARPS exhibited great potential for in vitro antioxidant activity in DPPH (58.24% ± 0.65%) and diammonium salt of 2,2′-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzthiazolin-6-yl) sulfonic acid (ABTS
 <sup>+</sup>) scavenging (52.23% ± 0.88%) activity and also showed good antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>Salmonella typhi</italic>. In addition, ARPS can inhibit human breast cancer cells (MCF-7) [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Hence, there are some studies reporting activities of other species belonging to the genus 
 <italic>Amphiroa</italic> such as antioxidative and matrix metalloproteinase inhibitory effects of 
 <italic>A. dilatata</italic> [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], antimicrobial activity of unspeciated 
 <italic>Amphiroa</italic> algae [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and antifungal and antibacterial activities of 
 <italic>A. bowerbankii</italic> and 
 <italic>A. ephedraea</italic> [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The fatty acids profiles are reported for 
 <italic>A. anceps</italic> [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and 
 <italic>A. beauvoisii</italic> [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] with some differences among profiles but it may be due to the different geographical locations and diverse abiotic factors.
