0: Due to the lack of literature data with the phytochemical composition of marine macroalgae from the Adriatic Sea we decided to provide the first detailed phytochemical study toward targeted compounds from red alga  A. rigida J.V.
1: Lamouroux collected from the Adriatic Sea.
2: This is the first report on the headspace and volatile oil composition including both fresh (FrAr) and air-dried (DrAr) samples of  A. rigida isolated by hydrodistillation (HD) and headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME).
3: In addition, the fatty acids and pigments profiles were determined in freeze-dried sample of  A. rigida (FdAr) for the first time and FdAr non-polar fractions were evaluated with respect to antimicrobial activity and antioxidant scavenging ability.
4: The main goals of the present study on  A. rigida were to: (a) investigate and compare volatilome profiles of FrAr and DrAr obtained by HS-SPME and HD followed by gas chromatography with flame ionization detector and mass spectrometry (GC-FID/MS) analysis; (b) determine fatty acids profile of FdAr after derivatization as methyl esters by GC-FID analysis; (c) evaluate pigment profiles of semipurified less polar fractions of FdAr by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC); (d) get an insight of antimicrobial activity of semipurified less polar fractions of FdAr against chosen bacterial and fungal panels; (e) evaluate the antioxidant activity of semipurified less polar fractions of FdAr by two assays, the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) and the reduction of radical cation ABTS + and (f) expand the knowledge of taxonomically related similarities/differences/chemical markers in the chemistry of marine red algae.
