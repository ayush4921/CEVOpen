<p>The headspace profile of 
 <italic>A. rigida</italic> dominated by two normal odd alkanes heptadecane and pentadecane and the comparison of HS-FrAr and HS-DrAr chemical profiles pointed out many similarities. The dominance of heptadecane can be connected with the decomposition of stearic acid found in 
 <italic>A. rigida</italic>. In addition, β-ionone found in HS-FrAr can be the degradation product of β-carotene that was present as the main carotenoid in 
 <italic>A. rigida</italic>. The predominant compound in HD-FrAr was (
 <italic>E</italic>)-phytol accompanied with a smaller abundance of its degradation product phytone. It can be suggested that (
 <italic>E</italic>)-phytol was formed by the degradation of chlorophyll 
 <italic>a</italic> found in 
 <italic>A. rigida</italic>. Unlike the headspace profiles, hydrodistillate chemical profiles were quite different when HD-DrAr and HD-FrAr were compared. (
 <italic>E</italic>)-phytol was approximately one-half reduced, but the abundance of phytone as well of unsaturated and oxygenated compounds increased indicating more intense fatty acids decomposition.
