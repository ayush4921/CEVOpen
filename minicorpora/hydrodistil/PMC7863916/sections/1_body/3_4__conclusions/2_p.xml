<p>The main fatty acids were palmitic acid, as the dominant one, followed by eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and stearic acid. The content of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) was almost double than the amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Given the relatively high content of EPA in this red alga, there is a possibility of using this alga as a good source of essential omega-3 fatty acids but further work for investigation of the bioavailability is necessary.</p>
