<p>A very small number of the Adriatic Sea algae have been investigated for the presence of VOCs. HS-SPME and HD were applied as complementary techniques to obtain the full profile of the alga VOCs [

 <xref rid="B22-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. HS-SPME is suitable for determining the headspace VOCs in the algae with the following advantages: small sample requirement, minimal sample handling, single-step gas extraction, quickness and solvent free. To obtain more detail headspace profiles two fibers of different polarities were used for HS-SPME: PDMS/DVB and DVB/CAR/PDMS. HD is used for obtaining the volatile oils from the algae without the interference of non-volatile compounds that are not isolated. The chromatographic analysis by GC-FID/MS was used. Striking differences were found between the obtained HS-SPME and HD chemical profiles.
