<p>The GC–MS survey indicates the presence of two normal odd alkanes (heptadecane (C
 <sub>17</sub>) up to 47.77% and pentadecane (C
 <sub>15</sub>) up to 7.08%) covering the majority of total headspace profile of fresh 
 <italic>A. rigida</italic> (HS-FrAr). Air-dried sample also contained in the headspace (HS-DrAr) C
 <sub>17</sub> as the major constituent (up to 53.96%) followed by C
 <sub>15</sub> (up to 7.02%). Only one more saturated hydrocarbon (eicosane, C
 <sub>20</sub>) was found as the minor constituent of HS-FrAr (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00520-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Other abundant compounds (with the percentages from 3 to 4 or more orders of magnitude below those of C
 <sub>17</sub>) in HS-FrAr were unsaturated hydrocarbons (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00520-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>): pentadec-1-ene up to 13.05%, (
 <italic>E</italic>)-pentadec-7-ene up to 6.00%, hexadec-1-ene up to 11.25% (
 <italic>E</italic>)-heptadec-3-ene up to 4.79%, (
 <italic>E</italic>)-heptadec-8-ene up to 0.77% and heptadec-1-ene up to 1.04%. Their abundance in HS-DrAr was slightly changed and C
 <sub>15</sub>-alkenes were not present (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00520-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Ectocarpene (6-[(
 <italic>Z</italic>)-but-1-enyl]-cyclohepta-1,4-diene) was only identified cyclic unsaturated hydrocarbon found in HS-FrAr, but in low abundance. Saturated and olefinic hydrocarbons were already found in different species of marine algae [

 <xref rid="B25-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. It was previously found that the major hydrocarbons of red algae 
 <italic>Porphyridium cruentum</italic>, 
 <italic>Gigartina</italic> sp. and 
 <italic>Plocamium</italic> sp. were more highly saturated, particularly the straight-chain hydrocarbons C
 <sub>17</sub> and C
 <sub>15</sub> [

 <xref rid="B26-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Heptadecane is strongly predominant in red alga 
 <italic>A. rigida</italic> headspace supporting previous findings on red algae [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The investigations of the elongation–decarboxylation pathway in the algae using radiotracers [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] detected decarboxylases capable of converting fatty acid to 
 <italic>n</italic>-alkane and decarboxylation of stearic acid to heptadecane in the alga 
 <italic>Anacystis nidulans</italic> was determined by 
 <sup>13</sup>C- and 
 <sup>2</sup>H-labeling and 
 <sup>13</sup>C nuclear magnetic resonance [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. According to that, possible explanation of predominance of heptadecane in the headspace of 
 <italic>A. rigida</italic> may be the degradation of stearic acid, which was detected in 
 <italic>A. rigida</italic> in present study. Several isomeric heptadecenes are present in the benthic marine algae [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and a predominance of heptadec-3-ene and heptadec-7-ene was suggested in brown and red algae, which is in partial agreement with the current findings.
