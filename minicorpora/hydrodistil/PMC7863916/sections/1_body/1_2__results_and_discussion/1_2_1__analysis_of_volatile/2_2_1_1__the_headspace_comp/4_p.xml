<p>Among other constituents, two benzene derivatives were found (benzaldehyde in HS-FrAr (up to 1.60%) and HS-DrAr (up to 1.16%) and benzyl alcohol exclusively in HS-DrAr (up to 9.44%)) and three sesquiterpenes (germacrene D in HS-FrAr and HS-DrAr, β-bourbonene and α-cubebene in HS-FrAr). In addition, tribromomethane up to 1.52% was found only in HS-FrAr and it was found previously in
