<p>Another group of present aliphatic compounds in HS-FrAr consisted of lower saturated aldehydes pentanal (up to 1.25%), hexanal (up to 6.72%), heptanal and nonanal (up to 1.63%) followed by unsaturated alkenals (
 <italic>E</italic>)-pent-2-enal, (
 <italic>E</italic>)-hex-2-enal (up to 7.41%), (
 <italic>E</italic>,
 <italic>E</italic>)-hepta-2,4-dienal, (
 <italic>E</italic>)-oct-2-enal (up to 0.69%) and (
 <italic>E</italic>)-dec-2-enal. Among them only C
 <sub>16</sub>-, C
 <sub>17</sub>- and C
 <sub>18</sub> -aldehydes and (
 <italic>E</italic>)-hex-2-enal were identified in HS-DrAr. Of the identified aldehydes hexanal was the major compound in HS-FrAr and HS-DrAr similar as in other algae [

 <xref rid="B31-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The seaweeds aldehydes may be derived from the degradation of PUFAs, either by autooxidation or by the enzymatic action of lipoxygenases [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], for example hexanal can be formed from linoleic acid via sequential action of lipoxygenase/fatty acid hydroperoxide lyase [

 <xref rid="B34-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In our study linoleic acid was detected in 
 <italic>A. rigida</italic>. Generally, red algae that showed decreased concentrations of PUFAs showed higher concentrations of aldehydes indicating degradation of fatty acids [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. These aldehydes are widespread, and have already been found in many other sea products, such as green and brown macroalgae [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], lobsters [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and oysters [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Some of them (e.g., unsaturated aldehydes C
 <sub>7</sub>, C
 <sub>8</sub> and C
 <sub>10</sub>) play a role as defense agents such as the inhibition of egg cleavage of sea urchins and reduction of hatching success in copepods [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Several aliphatic alcohols and alkenols were found in HS-FrAr: pentan-1-ol, (
 <italic>Z</italic>)-pent-2-en-1-ol, hexan-1-ol (up to 2.36%), oct-1-en-3-ol (up to 0.5%), octan-1-ol (up to 0.49%) and tetradecan-1-ol (up to 1.02%). Among them only oct-1-en-3-ol was present in HS-DrAr. The aldehydes can be converted either enzymatically or spontaneously to other alcohols or alkenols. 6-Methylhept-5-en-2-one was present up to 0.67% in HS-FrAr and up to 0.90% in HS-DrAr. It was the most abundant ketone and it is common compound in the algae (e.g., it was found in relatively high amount in the green alga 
 <italic>Capsosiphon fulvescens</italic> [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]). 6-Methylhept-5-en-2-one was the only aliphatic ketone present in HS-FrAr and HS-DrAr, while octan-2,3-dione and (
 <italic>E</italic>,
 <italic>E</italic>)-octa-3,5-dien-2-one were present only in HS-DrAr.
