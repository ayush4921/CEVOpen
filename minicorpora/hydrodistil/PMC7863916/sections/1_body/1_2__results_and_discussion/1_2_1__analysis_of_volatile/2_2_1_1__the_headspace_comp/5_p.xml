<p>Summary comparison of HS-FrAr and HS-DrAr revealed many similarities (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00520-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) regarding the presence and abundance of the major compounds (e.g., C
 <sub>17</sub>, C
 <sub>15</sub>, hexanal, (

 <italic>E</italic>)-heptadec-3-ene) as well for many minor constituents (e.g., heptanal, oct-1-en-3-ol, 6-methylhept-5-en-2-one, (
 <italic>E</italic>)-oct-2-enal, nonanal and benzaldehyde). However, several compounds were found exclusively after air-drying (such as 2-pentylfuran, benzyl alcohol, octan-2,3-dione, (
 <italic>E</italic>)-octa-3,5-diene-2-one and decanal) indicating higher accumulation of oxidation products in HS-DrAr. The most striking difference was high benzyl alcohol percentage (up to 9.44%) found exclusively in HS-DrAr that could origin from benzaldehyde or other parent compounds during air-drying. Dimethyl sulfide (DMS) appeared in HS-DrAr and it is the algal osmolyte, which derives from dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) that has been synthetized and accumulated in a wide range of taxa [
