<p>Degraded carotenoid products were also present: (
 <italic>E</italic>)-β-ionone in HS-FrAr (up to 1.55%) and HS-DrAr and β-cyclocitral only in HS-FrAr. It is known that β-ionone is formed by the enzymatic cleavage of β-carotene [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] so that it implies that the β-ionone in 
 <italic>A. rigida</italic> may be formed from β-carotene that was found in our study. Those two compounds are ubiquity found in marine algae (e.g., in cyanobacteria [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]). In the later stages of carotenoid degradation (further oxidation of longer chain intermediates), increasing amounts of short-chain mono and dioxygenated compounds including β-cyclocitral are formed [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. β-Cyclocitral, α-ionone and β-ionone showed inhibitory effects on 
 <italic>C. pyrenoidosa</italic> cell growth [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. β-Cyclocitral can cause cell rupture of 
 <italic>Nitzschia palea</italic> [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] and high concentration β-cyclocitral even impact the growth of
