<p>The predominant compound in the hydrodistillate of fresh 
 <italic>A. rigida</italic> (HD-FrAr) was (
 <italic>E</italic>)-phytol (41.75%) accompanied with a smaller abundance of its degradation product phytone (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00520-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Diterpene alcohol (
 <italic>E</italic>)-phytol is a ubiquitous compound in chlorophyll 
 <italic>a</italic> containing marine algae [
 <xref rid="B52-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] and was already found in the volatile oil of different green algae [

 <xref rid="B53-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The red algae are known for their content of chlorophyll 
 <italic>a,</italic> which is present in higher amounts than in green algae [
 <xref rid="B54-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Detected (
 <italic>E</italic>)-phytol could be formed from chlorophyll 
 <italic>a</italic> degradation, which was detected in our study. Phytol oxidation could lead, among others, to methylated long chain fatty acid ketoneâ€”hexahydroxyfarnesyl acetone (6,10,14-trimethylpentadecan-2-one, phytone) that was found in the oil from the dried sample (HD-DrAr) at 7.28% and HD-FrAr at 2.21%. Phytone results mainly from the hydrolysis of chlorophyll or bacteriochlorophyll-a photoproducts or from phytol biodegradation [
