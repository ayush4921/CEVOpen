<p>Alkanes C
 <sub>17</sub> and C
 <sub>15</sub>, the major compounds of HS-FrAr and HS-DrAr, were present in HD-FrAr and HD-DrAr, but at more than ca. 5-10 orders of magnitude lower percentages (3.80% and 12.22%; 2.36% and 0.91%, respectively) in comparison to the headspace. Several higher aliphatic alkenes were present (the same ones as found by HS-SPME) as minor constituents: pentadec-1-ene, (
 <italic>E</italic>)-pentadec-7-ene, (
 <italic>E</italic>)-heptadec-8-ene and (
 <italic>E</italic>)-heptadec-3-ene. Saturated and unsaturated carbonyl compounds were also identified such as (
 <italic>E</italic>)-hex-2-enal, heptanal, 6-methylhept-5-en-2-one, octan-2-one, octanal, (
 <italic>E</italic>)-oct-2-enal, nonan-2-one, nonanal, undecan-2-one, pentadecanal and heptadecan-2-one. Few aliphatic alkanols and alkenols were identified; 2-ethylhexan-1-ol, octan-1-ol, dodecan-1-ol, tridecan-1-ol, pentadecan-1-ol, (
 <italic>E</italic>)-hexadec-11-en-1-ol and hexadecan-1-ol.
