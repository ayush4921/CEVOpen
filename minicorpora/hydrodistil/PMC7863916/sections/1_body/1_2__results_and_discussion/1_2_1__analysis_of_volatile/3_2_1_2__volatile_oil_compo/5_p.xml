<p>In summary, HD-DrAr profile was quite different in comparison to HD-FrAr. The percentage of (
 <italic>E</italic>)-phytol was double reduced up to 16.44%, but at the same time the abundance of phytone increased to 7.28%. Heptadecane was increased to 12.22% and (
 <italic>E</italic>)-heptadec-8-ene, (
 <italic>E</italic>)-heptadec-3-ene and pentadec-1-ene indicating more intense fatty acid decomposition. The abundance of oxygenated compounds (e.g., (
 <italic>E</italic>)-hex-2-enal, heptanal, octan-2-one, octanal, (
 <italic>E</italic>)-oct-2-enal, octan-1-ol, nonanal, decan-2-one, pentadecanal, pentadecan-1-ol, hexadecan-1-ol and heptadecan-2-one) was also elevated indicating oxidation reactions. More intensive oxidation and fatty acid decomposition were confirmed by the formation of additional oxygenated compounds, not found in the headspace such as: heptan-2-one, (
 <italic>E</italic>)-hept-2-enal, oct-1-en-3-ol, octane-2,3-dione, (
 <italic>E</italic>,
 <italic>Z</italic>)-octa-3,5-dien-2-one, (
 <italic>E</italic>,
 <italic>E</italic>)-octa-2,4-dienal, (
 <italic>E</italic>,
 <italic>Z</italic>)-nona-2,6-dienal, (
 <italic>Z</italic>)-non-2-enal, decanal, decan-1-ol, (
 <italic>E</italic>,
 <italic>Z</italic>)-deca-2,4-dienal, (
 <italic>E</italic>,
 <italic>E</italic>)-deca-2,4-dienal, undecan-1-ol, dodecan-1-ol, tridecanal, tetradecanal, (
 <italic>Z</italic>)-hexadec-11-en-1-ol and octadecanal. Additionally, degradation of carotenoids was promoted since the percentage of (
 <italic>E</italic>)-β-ionone was elevated and β-cyclocitral was only present in HD-DrAr.
