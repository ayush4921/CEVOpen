<p>Kavalappa et al. [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] used similar mixture of solvents (MeOH:DCM:H
 <sub>2</sub>O) for the extraction of pigments from red algae 
 <italic>Gracillaria</italic> spp. Among all tested macroalgae, red alga 
 <italic>Gracillaria</italic> spp. showed a dominance of β-carotene and lutein as the major carotenoids, which was also shown in our study. Generally, the presence of β-carotene and lutein is characteristic for red algae, especially for the order Corallinales where 
 <italic>A. rigida</italic> also belongs. There are contrary reports of the pigment composition of red algae and it is very difficult to find the relationship between the pigment profile and phylogeny of red algae. Some reports indicate that the main xanthophylls in red algae are zeaxanthin and lutein [
 <xref rid="B63-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], while others reported more complex carotenid profiles including fucoxanthin and neoxanthin [
 <xref rid="B64-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. In our study we found lutein and fucoxanthin, which was not in accordance with mentioned studies pointing out high diversity of pigment profiles among red algae. Explanation for the lacking of some pigments, such as zeaxanthin, which is characteristic for red algae, can be related to the capability to synthesize this pigment and photoacclimation state of the algae. Schubert et al. [
 <xref rid="B64-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] did not detect zeaxanthin in organisms that were collected from the low tidal zone, while it was detected in species from the high tidal zone. Additionally, investigated algae from the order Corallinales showed the presence of lutein as the major carotenoid and zeaxanthin with minor concentration or completely missing. This may explain why we did not detect zeaxanthin in the fractions of 
 <italic>A. rigida</italic> and lutein was showed as the major carotenoid in F3. The only ubiquitous pigments in all analyzed red algae were α-carotene and β-carotene [
 <xref rid="B64-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] that was also shown in our study. Furthermore, the presence of fucoxanthin can be associated with epiphyte contamination of the samples [
 <xref rid="B63-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. According to the literature [
 <xref rid="B54-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], among chlorophylls (
 <italic>a, b, c</italic> and 
 <italic>d</italic>) only chlorophyll 
 <italic>a</italic> is present in red algae, which was also shown in our study. It is suggested that the content of chlorophyll 
 <italic>a</italic> in red algae depends on available sunlight. Namely, in the months with the lowest sunlight chlorophyll 
 <italic>a</italic> is present with the highest amounts [
 <xref rid="B65-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], which can explain the high concentration of chlorophyll 
 <italic>a</italic> found in 
 <italic>A. rigida</italic>. Chlorophyll 
 <italic>a</italic> was present in higher amount in 
 <italic>A. rigida</italic> when compared to the amount found in 
 <italic>Amphiroa fragilissima,</italic> while the content found in another red alga, 
 <italic>Gracilaria foliifera,</italic> [
 <xref rid="B66-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] was very similar to the content obtained in our study.
