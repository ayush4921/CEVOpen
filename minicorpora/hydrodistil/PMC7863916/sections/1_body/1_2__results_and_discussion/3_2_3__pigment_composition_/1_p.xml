<p>HPLC analysis of the pigments was performed on semipurified fractions 3 (F3) and 4 (F4) of FdAr with the solvents MeOH and MeOH:DCM (1:1,

 <sup>−1</sup>, while these two pigments were not detected in F4 with used less polar mixture of solvents (MeOH:DCM). Hence, F4 revealed the presence of chlorophyll

 <sup>−1</sup> and β-carotene with the concentration of 6.18 ± 0.72 mg g
 <sup>−1</sup>. Additionally, α-carotene was detected but the concentration was under the limit of quantification. Even though, α-carotene and β-carotene are known as the major carotenoids present in red algae, we did not detect α-carotene at a high concentration. On the other hand, lutein was detected and it was suggested that it is formed by the hydroxylation of α-carotene [
