<p>The literature reports on a correlation between phenolic content and antioxidant activity are already present [
 <xref rid="B71-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>,
 <xref rid="B72-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. The antioxidant activity of polyphenols is the result of their ability to act as reducing agents, hydrogen donors and free radical quenchers, or even as metal chelators [
 <xref rid="B73-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. However, other compounds such as pigments (i.e., carotenoids), polysaccharides, proteins or peptides can also influence the antioxidant activity [
 <xref rid="B71-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Since antioxidants are usually involved in several mechanisms of action, a single assay could not accurately reflect all of the antioxidants in a complex fraction. Therefore, it is necessary to use at least two different methods to evaluate the antioxidant activity of obtained fractions [
 <xref rid="B74-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>,
 <xref rid="B75-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Herein, the antioxidant activity of the fractions F3 and F4 of 
 <italic>A. rigida</italic> were tested by implementing two antioxidant assays—ABTS and ORAC. The results obtained using ABTS and ORAC are depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00520-f001">Figure 1</xref>. ABTS assay is based on the inhibition of the absorbance (decolorization of the ABTS
 <sup>•+</sup>, through measuring the reduction of the radical cation). The results of ABTS measurement implied relatively low antioxidant activity for all tested fractions with the highest inhibition percentage around 30% for F3 (5 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) and presented as 3.87 ± 0.62 mg g
 <sup>−1</sup> trolox equivalents (TE), while for F4 the activity was 3.42 ± 0.31 mg g
 <sup>−1</sup> TE. The ORAC assay measures a fluorescent signal from a probe that is quenched in the presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The addition of an antioxidant absorbs the generated ROS, allowing the fluorescent signal to persist. The results of the ORAC assay within this study revealed that the highest activity was obtained for F4 (825.63 ± 154.45 μmol g
 <sup>−1</sup> TE) followed by F3 (205.11 ± 27.21 μmol g
 <sup>−1</sup> TE). Considering the polarity of these fractions, the obtained order could be ascribed to the highest carotenoid content in the least polar fraction F4, as it was presented in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00520-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> for F4 where α-carotene and β-carotene were detected for which is known that they possess a significant antioxidant activity [

 <xref rid="B77-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. It was also reported that the pigments such as lutein and astaxanthin have major contribution to the antioxidant activity of macroalgae [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It is evident that the antioxidant activity of fractions of 
 <italic>A. rigida</italic> is dependent not only on polyphenols but also other compounds that exhibit different antioxidant modes of action such as carotenoids.
