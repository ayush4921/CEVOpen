<p>In the present study, different polarity fractions were first analyzed for their total phenolic content since it is well known that phenolics exhibit antioxidant properties [
 <xref rid="B69-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. As can be seen in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00520-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>, the distribution of phenolic compounds in 
 <italic>A. rigida</italic> demonstrated that among two less polar fractions, F3 contained the higher amount, 59.38 ± 1.62 mg GAE per gram of fraction, than fraction F4 (16.71 ± 0.29 mg g
 <sup>−1</sup> GAE). In comparison, other studies evaluating the total phenolic content of red algae reported the values of 10.7 ± 0.3 and 4.7 ± 0.6 mg g
 <sup>−1</sup> GAE for the methanolic extract from 
 <italic>Palmaria palmate</italic> and 
 <italic>Porphyra tenera</italic> [
 <xref rid="B70-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], respectively, while for the two other red algae (
 <italic>Gracilaria opuntia</italic>, and 
 <italic>Digenea simplex</italic>) TPC was on average around 31.03 mg g
 <sup>−1</sup> GAE [
 <xref rid="B66-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], indicating the higher polyphenolic content in 
 <italic>A. rigida</italic>.
