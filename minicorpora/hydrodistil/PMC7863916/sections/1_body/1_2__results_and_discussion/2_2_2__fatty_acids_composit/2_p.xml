<p>As shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00520-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, the main fatty acids were palmitic acid (C16:0), as the dominant one, followed by eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C20:5n3) and stearic acid (C18:0) with mean values 42.86%, 19.14% and 11.65%, respectively. The content of saturated fatty acids (SFA) was 59.65% followed by a considerable amount of PUFAs, 33.16%. PUFAs are important essential components that play an important role in several human pathologies (e.g., obesity, diabetes mellitus type 2, heart diseases and atherosclerosis). Generally, phylum Rhodophyta is characterized for containing a large diversity of essential fatty acids, especially orders Gigartinales, Corallinales and Gracilariales. Algae belonging to these orders are rich in EPA and arachidonic acid (C20:4n6) [

 <xref rid="B57-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Given the relatively high content of EPA in this red algae, there is a possibility of using this alga as a good source of essential omega-3 fatty acids, but further research for investigation of their bioavailability is necessary. 
 <italic>A. rigida</italic> contained a significantly higher amount of EPA (19.14%) when compared to other red algae examined in a recent study [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] with the values ranging from 0.47% to 7.95%. Jayasree et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] examined fatty acid composition of 
 <italic>Amphiroa anceps</italic> and palmitic acid was shown to be the major component with a mean value of 57.57%, while arachidonic acid was the second abundant compound (18.67%). Regarding the amount of EPA, it was significantly lower when compared to our study (2.46%). On the other hand
 <italic>, Amphiroa beauvoisii</italic> contained higher amounts of EPA (25.2%). These variations among species belonging to the same genus can be explained by the exposure to diverse abiotic factors, and by different geographical locations resulting in different fatty acids profiles [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We did not find arachidonic acid in 
 <italic>A. rigida,</italic> which was not in accordance with previous studies indicating that the algae belonging to phylum Rhodophyta contained high concentrations of that fatty acid [
