<p>Since this is a first report of antimicrobial activity of fractionated organic extracts of 
 <italic>A. rigida,</italic> there are no directly comparable data in reported literature. Only one study recently evaluated this species of red alga collected from the Indian Ocean but specifically focused on its polysaccharides extracts tested against only one isolate of a multidrug resistant 
 <italic>Salmonella typhi</italic> [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. That study also employed both disk diffusion and broth microdilution tests and reported a very strong antibacterial activity that exceeded the inhibition observed with streptomycin, which the authors argued to be associated with the sulfur-groups of the polysaccharides. Moreover, the study optimized the extraction of polysaccharides achieving high extraction yields so the compound(s) responsible for the observed antibacterial activity are different than present in two fractions (F3 and F4) of the present study. Two other studies evaluated the antimicrobial activity of unspeciated 
 <italic>Amphiroa</italic> algae. One was conducted in the Gulf of Thailand and reported a very weak activity (zone of inhibition of less than 1 mm) of the aqueous extract against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Proteus mirabilis</italic> and 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, but no activity of the ethanolic extract [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The other study was conducted in India and tested methanolic extract against three 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> spp. that were all mild to moderately inhibited by the disk diffusion method. Another study of methanolic extracts of 
 <italic>A. bowerbankii</italic> and 
 <italic>A. ephedraea</italic> algae from the east coast of South Africa reported relatively high minimal inhibitory concentrations of 6.25 mg mL
 <sup>âˆ’1</sup> (
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) against both 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Interestingly, that study used bimonthly sampling and reported seasonal variation of antibacterial activity that was observed only in late autumn and winter against 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and bimodally in autumn and spring against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. The reasons for seasonal effects and its ecological function have not been elucidated but have been observed in other studies. For instance, two studies of another red alga 
 <italic>Asparagopsis taxiformis</italic> collected near Sicily, Italy showed antibacterial activities only in colder months of the year; March to May vs. June to September [
 <xref rid="B67-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,
 <xref rid="B68-molecules-26-00520" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. If the single-point sampling in September of this study has similarly affected the lack of antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic>A. rigida</italic> from the Adriatic Sea remains to be further investigated.
