 <p id="Par1">The intensive application of agrochemicals in crops has negatively impacted the environment and other organisms. The use of naturally occurring compounds may be an alternative to mitigate these effects. Plants are secondary metabolite reservoirs and may present allelopathic activity, which is potentially interesting to be used in bioherbicide formulations. In this context, the present work aimed to evaluate the phytotoxic and cytotoxic effects of essential oils extracted from leaves of 
  <italic>Sparattanthelium botocudorum</italic> and 
  <italic>Sparattanthelium tupiniquinorum</italic> in bioassays with the plant models 
  <italic>Lactuca sativa </italic>L. and 
  <italic>Sorghum bicolor </italic>L. Moench. The essential oils were applied at concentrations of 3,000, 1,500, 750, 375 and 187.5 ppm. Chemical characterization of the oils was performed, and their impact on the percentage of germinated seeds, initial development of 
  <italic>L. sativa</italic> and 
  <italic>S. bicolor</italic> seedlings, and changes in the mitotic cycle of meristematic cells from 
  <italic>L. sativa</italic> roots was evaluated. The major compound of the essential oils was germacrene D, followed by bicyclogermacrene, β-elemene and germacrene A. The phytotoxicity assay showed that the essential oils of both species reduced the root and shoot growth in 
  <italic>L. sativa</italic> and decreased the germination and shoot growth in 
  <italic>S. bicolor.</italic> Inhibition was dependent on the tested oil concentration. In the cytotoxicity assay, a decrease in mitotic index and chromosomal and nuclear alterations were observed, which resulted from aneugenic and clastogenic action.
