 <caption> Phytotoxicity of different concentrations of S. botocudorum essential oil, water, solvent (C −) and glyphosate (C +) , tested on seeds and seedlings: (A) L. sativa and (B) S. bicolor. The means followed by the letter a equalled distilled water (C −); means followed by b equalled dichloromethane (DCM) (C −); and means followed by c equaled glyphosate (C +). The numbers in the figure caption represent the concentrations (ppm) of the essential oils. %G: percentage of germinated seeds after 48 h of exposure to treatments; GSI: germination speed index of the seeds during the first 48 h, evaluated every 8 h, after exposure to treatments; RL: root length (mm) after 48 h of exposure to treatments; SL: shoot length (mm) after 120 h of exposure to treatments. The left y axis refers to the means of germination, and the right y axis to GSI, RL and SL. </caption>
