 <caption> Meristematic cell analysis of L. sativa roots treated with different concentrations (ppm) of the essential oils from (A) S. botocudorum and (B) S. tupiniquinorum, water (C −), solvent (C −) or glyphosate (C +) . The means followed by the letter a equalled distilled water (C −); means followed by b equalled dichloromethane (DCM) (C −); and means followed by c equaled glyphosate (C +) . The five variables presented are MI: mitotic index; CA: chromosomal alterations; NA: nuclear alterations; and MNC: micronuclei. The numbers in the figure caption represent the concentrations (ppm) of the essential oils. The left y axis shows the values of MNC and MN, and the right y axis refers to the values of CA and MI, according to Dunnett’s test (p &lt; 0.05). </caption>
