  <p>Phytotoxicity of different concentrations of 
   <italic>S. botocudorum</italic> essential oil, water, solvent (C −) and glyphosate (C +) , tested on seeds and seedlings: 
   <bold>(A)</bold>
   <italic>L. sativa</italic> and 
   <bold>(B)</bold>
   <italic>S. bicolor</italic>. The means followed by the letter 
   <italic>a</italic> equalled distilled water (C −); means followed by 
   <italic>b</italic> equalled dichloromethane (DCM) (C −); and means followed by 
   <italic>c</italic> equaled glyphosate (C +). The numbers in the figure caption represent the concentrations (ppm) of the essential oils. %G: percentage of germinated seeds after 48 h of exposure to treatments; GSI: germination speed index of the seeds during the first 48 h, evaluated every 8 h, after exposure to treatments; RL: root length (mm) after 48 h of exposure to treatments; SL: shoot length (mm) after 120 h of exposure to treatments. The left y axis refers to the means of germination, and the right y axis to GSI, RL and SL.
