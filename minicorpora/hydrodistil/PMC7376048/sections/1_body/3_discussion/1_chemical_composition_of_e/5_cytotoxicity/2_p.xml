<p id="Par35">Chromosomal alterations, such as those found here, enable evaluating the mechanisms of action of the essential oil compounds on the cell cycle. These mechanisms may be clastogenic or aneugenic. For instance, the presence of bridges and chromosome fragments demonstrate a clastogenic effect and the action of the molecules directly on the individual's DNA

 </sup>. Chromosome bridges occur when chromosomes are dragged by their centromere to the cell poles (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c); through depolymerization of the alpha and beta tubulin filaments, the breakage of chromosomes forms new chromosome fragments, enabling new fusion and future breaks

 </sup>. Chromosome fragments, also deriving from chromosome breaks, result from interaction of the chemical compound with chromatin/DNA

 </sup>. These fragments are acentric, since the breaks occur in telomeric regions, and may lead to the formation of chromosome bridges, thus preventing the attachment of spindle fibers to the chromosome during the cell cycle, since the microtubules bind directly to the centromere
