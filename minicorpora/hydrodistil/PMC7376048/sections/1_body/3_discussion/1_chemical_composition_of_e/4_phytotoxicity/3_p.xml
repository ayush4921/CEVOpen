 </sup>, terpenoids are growth inhibitors, whereas monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes are shoot and root growth inhibitors. Monoterpenes can affect the integrity of the cell membrane, causing a change in the fluidity state by acting on membrane phospholipids, increasing the ratio between unsaturated and saturated fatty acids, thus altering the physical arrangement of the membrane
