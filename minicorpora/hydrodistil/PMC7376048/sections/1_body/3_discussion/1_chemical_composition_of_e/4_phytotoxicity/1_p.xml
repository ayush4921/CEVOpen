<p id="Par28">The essential oils from 
 <italic>S. botocudorum</italic> and 
 <italic>S. tupiniquinorum</italic> were more efficient in inhibiting variables related to the initial development of lettuce and sorghum seedlings than the commercial herbicide glyphosate. These oils affected the shoot length of both used plant models. In addition, the two model plants, one monocot and one eudicot, were sensitive to even low concentrations of allelochemicals used in the treatments.
