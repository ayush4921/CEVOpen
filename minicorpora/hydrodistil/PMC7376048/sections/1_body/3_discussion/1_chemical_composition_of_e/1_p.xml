<p id="Par25">Although studies in the genus 
 <italic>Sparattanthelium</italic> are scarce, the chemical composition of its essential oils is similar to other species belonging to the basal angiosperms, mainly from the genus 
 <italic>Hernandia</italic>, family Hernandiaceae. According to Brophy et al.

 </sup>, the species 
 <italic>H. albiflora</italic>, 
 <italic>H. bivalvis</italic> and 
 <italic>H. nymphaeifolia</italic> present bicyclogermacrene, germacrene D and γ-cadinene in their chemical composition. Representing another genus from the same family, 
 <italic>Gyrocarpus americanus</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>Amwlcanu</italic> has germacrene D as major essential oil compound, with 31% of representation

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>
 </sup>, the species 
 <italic>Ocotea puberula</italic> (family Lauraceae) presents, among the chemical constituents of its essential oil, bicyclogermacrene, germacrene D, α caryophyllene, β-elemene and γ-cadinene. Other studies performed in the family Piperaceae, another basal angiosperm, have shown that some species have chemical composition similar to the two 
 <italic>Sparattanthelium</italic> species studied here, with divergence only in the major compound
