0: The evaluation of biological activity and identification of bioactive compounds have been accomplished by means of plant bioassays 4,  5,  25,  26.
1: Among others, these tests are used to assess phytotoxicity and cytotoxicity as well as to determine the mechanism of action of the studied compounds, and provide results quickly.
2: In addition, model organisms such as  Lactuca sativa L. (eudicotyledon) and  Sorghum bicolor L. Moench (monocotyledon) are highly sensitive, enable the simultaneous analysis of various compounds, and exhibit high proliferation rate and rapid germination 5,  25,  27.
