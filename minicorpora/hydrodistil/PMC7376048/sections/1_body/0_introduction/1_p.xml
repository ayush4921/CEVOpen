However, the use of these compounds has led to problems related to plant resistance, environmental contamination, and risks to human and animal health. Therefore, it is necessary to find alternative methods for agricultural pest control

 </sup>. In this context, secondary metabolites may be of particular interest, as they can be directly or indirectly used in the development of new herbicides. These compounds are produced by plants and comprise three major groups, which are found in extracts and essential oils: terpenoids, alkaloids and phenolic compounds
