<p id="Par23">The essential oils from 
 <italic>S. botocudorum</italic> and 
 <italic>S .tupiniquinorum</italic> were cytotoxic to lettuce meristematic cells. A reduction in MI and an increase in CA and NA were observed (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a, b). The MI of cells treated with the essential oil from 
 <italic>S. botocudorum</italic> was more affected than by glyphosate. The oil from 
 <italic>S. tupiniquinorum</italic> also acted similarly to glyphosate for MI. As for the chromosomal changes, an increase was observed according to the oil concentration, nearing the positive control at the lowest concentrations and being more toxic at higher concentrations. Nuclear and micronuclear alterations were more expressive in the treatments with essential oil from 
 <italic>S. tupiniquinorum</italic>, although they were different from the positive control.
