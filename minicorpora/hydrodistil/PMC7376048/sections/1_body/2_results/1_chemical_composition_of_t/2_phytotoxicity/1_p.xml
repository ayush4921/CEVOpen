<p id="Par19">The essential oils from both 
 <italic>Sparattanthelium</italic> species performed biological activities in the two used plant models. Inhibition was dependent on the analyzed variable and the oil concentration tested (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The essential oil from 
 <italic>S. botocudorum</italic> decreased the germination index of 
 <italic>L. sativa</italic> seeds at the highest concentration (3,000 ppm), matching the positive control (glyphosate) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). The GSI was also reduced when compared to the positive control, being more expressive at the concentration of 3,000 ppm, and matched the positive control at 1,500 ppm. Root length was not affected, and all germinated seeds produced roots with length similar to those treated with negative controls (water or dichloromethane). On the other hand, at the two highest oil concentrations, shoot length was smaller than the growth observed in the treatments with the negative controls.
