0: After 48 h of exposure, the roots of ten lettuce seeds were removed and fixed in Carnoy I (3:1 methanol + acetic acid) , then stored at  20 C for at least 24 h. Only lettuce roots were used in this assay, as they are considered a suitable model for microscopic analysis to test the toxic effect of chemical compounds 27.
1: Lettuce roots show high proliferative activity, fast growth, a high number of seeds, many chromosomes, high sensitivity to mutagenic and genotoxic compounds, and easy-to-manipulate roots 5,  34.
2: Slides were prepared using the squashing method 35.
3: First, root tips were hydrolyzed in 5 N HCl at room temperature for 18 min.
4: Next, the meristematic region was removed and placed on a slide, stained with 2% acetic orcein, covered with acoverslip, and crushed.
5: Each slide was prepared using two treated meristems, with five slides being evaluated per treatment (one slide for each Petri dish).
6: One thousand cells were evaluated per slide, totaling 5,000 meristematic cells observed per treatment.
7: The following parameters were analyzed: mitotic index (MI) , calculated as the number of dividing cells as a fraction of the total number of cells; chromosomal aberrations (CA) , expressed as the percentage of each aberrationlost chromosomes, adherent chromosomes, chromosomal fragments, chromosomal bridges, c-metaphases and chromosomal polyploidizationdivided by the total number of cells; and nuclear aberrations (NC), determined by the frequency of condensed nuclei and micronucleated cells in interphase 25,  34.
