0: For each  S. botocudorum and  S. tupiniquinorum essential oil, five concentrations were evaluated: 3,000 ppm, 1,500 ppm, 750 ppm, 375 ppm and 187.5 ppm.
1: The concentrations were obtained by diluting the oil in the solvent dichloromethane (99.5%).
2: Distilled water and dichloromethane were used as negative controls (C), and glyphosate (1 mL/L) as positive control (C +) .
3: Twenty-five seeds each of  L. sativa and  S. bicolor were placed in Petri dishes (9 cm of diameter), with five repetitions, totalling 125 seeds for each treatment.
4: The seeds were placed on filter paper moistened with 2.5 mL of oil diluted in the solvent.
5: Petri dishes were arranged in a completely randomized design (CRD) and placed in Biochemical Oxygen Demand (B.O.D.)
6: at 24 C throughout the experiment.
7: The percentage of germinated seeds was observed after 8, 16, 24, 36 and 48 h of exposure to the treatments.
8: Root and shoot growth were determined after 48 and 96 h of exposure to the oils, respectively, using a digital caliper.
9: From the data obtained, the following variables were evaluated: germination rate (radicle protrusion) after 48 h (G%) = total of germinated seeds/total of treatment seeds  100; germination speed index (GSI) = (N1 * 1) + (N2  N1) * 1/2 + (N3N2) * 1/3 + ... (Ny  (Ny  1)) * 1/y, where  Ny represents the number of germinated seeds in a given period and  y represents the total number of evaluation periods 33; and root length (RL) and shoot length (SL), in mm 25.
