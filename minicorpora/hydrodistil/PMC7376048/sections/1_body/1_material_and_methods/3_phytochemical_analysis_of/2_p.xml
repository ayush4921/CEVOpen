<p id="Par12">The samples used were removed from the vials in 1 μL volume of a 2% solution of essential oil dissolved in ethanol. The GC–MS analyses were performed on electronic impact equipment with impact energy of 70 eV; scanning interval of 0.50 fragments s
 <sup>−1</sup>; and fragments detected from 29 to 400 (
 <italic>m/z</italic>). The GC-FID analyses were performed with a flame formed by H
 <sub>2</sub> and atmospheric air at 300 °C, with 40 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup> and 400 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup> flows for H
 <sub>2</sub> and air, respectively. Detection of ions occurs when the organic compounds present in the sample are mixed with the carrier gas (He) and a stream is produced proportional to the amount of these compounds in the sample. If only He and H
 <sub>2</sub> are mixed, a small stream is produced between the electrodes.
