0: Samples of the essential oils extracted from the leaves were analyzed via gas chromatography with flame-ionization detection (GC-FID) (Shimadzu GC-2010 Plus) and gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GCMS) (Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010 SE) according to protocol of Souza et al.
1: (2017), with adjustments.
2: For these analyses, the following conditions were used: Helium (He) as carrier gas for both procedures, with flow and linear velocity of 2.80 mL min 1 and 50.8 cm s 1 for GC-FID and 1.98 mL min 1 and 50.9 cm s 1 for GCMS; injector temperature of 220 C at the split ratio of 1:30; fused silica capillary column (30 m  0.25 mm) ; stationary phase Rtx -5MS (0.25 m film thickness) ; oven temperature set as follows: initial temperature of 40 C for 3 min, then gradual increase at a rate of 3 C min 1 until reaching 180 C, where it remained for 10 min, for a total analysis time of 59.67 min; and temperatures of 240 C for FID and 200 C for MS.
