0: Identification of the essential oil components was accomplished by comparing the obtained mass spectra with the mass spectra available in spectrographic databases (Wiley 7, NIST 05 and NIST 05 s).
1: In addition, the Kovats Retention Index(KRI) of each compound was calculated using a mixture of C7C40 saturated alkanes (Supelco-USA) and the adjusted retention time of each compound, obtained via GC-FID, then compared with those in the literature 30  32.
