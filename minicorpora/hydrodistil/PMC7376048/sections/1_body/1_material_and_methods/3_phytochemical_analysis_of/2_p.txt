0: The samples used were removed from the vials in 1 L volume of a 2% solution of essential oil dissolved in ethanol.
1: The GCMS analyses were performed on electronic impact equipment with impact energy of 70 eV; scanning interval of 0.50 fragments s 1; and fragments detected from 29 to 400 ( m/z).
2: The GC-FID analyses were performed with a flame formed by H 2 and atmospheric air at 300 C, with 40 mL min 1 and 400 mL min 1 flows for H 2 and air, respectively.
3: Detection of ions occurs when the organic compounds present in the sample are mixed with the carrier gas (He) and a stream is produced proportional to the amount of these compounds in the sample.
4: If only He and H 2 are mixed, a small stream is produced between the electrodes.
