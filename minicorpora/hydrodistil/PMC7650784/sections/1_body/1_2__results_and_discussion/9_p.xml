<p>In the ORS selection (Barisardo), coming from the East cost of Sardinia, ORS2 was recognizable by the major concentrations of limonene, 1,8-cineole, α-terpineol, geranyl acetate, and dihydroeugenyl butanoate; while ORS3 showed the highest concentration of α-pinene. In the two BOS selections, we found a distinctive compound, myrtenyl acetate. In ISL (Isili) selections, in spite of the common origin from the same geographical area, they were quite different each other. In fact, in ISL1 we found o-cymene and 
 <italic>Cis</italic>-geraniol, which were not present in ISL3.
