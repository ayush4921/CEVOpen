<p>In addition to previously presented results, eight more selections (MON5, CUG11, SIN2, TEL10, BUD1, PSF1, and SAS1) were represented by only one sample (
 <xref rid="plants-09-01288-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). In the MON5 selection, major constituents were Î±-pinene, 1,8-cineole, limonene, and geranyl acetate. In CUG11, as principal constituents are concerned, a similar concentration as MON5 were mostly found. In PFS1 a high concentration of dihydroeugenyl butanoate was observed.
