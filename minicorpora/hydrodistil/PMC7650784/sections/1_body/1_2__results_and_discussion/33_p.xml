<p>The usefulness of the two models, reported in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01288-f010">Figure 10</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01288-f011">Figure 11</xref>, respectively, is appreciable if considered together. In fact, from the composition of essential oils of each cultivar shown in the two score plots, it is possible to choose, for example, a plant with low vigor and high productivity. In this way, it would be easier to characterize less demanding cultivars from an agronomic point of view and find those with generous yields, even without knowing these characteristics beforehand. Therefore, by conducting an analysis of essential oils on a spontaneous Myrtle plant, it will be possible, by applying the model, to predict the vigor and fruit productivity and then decide whether it will be convenient or not.
