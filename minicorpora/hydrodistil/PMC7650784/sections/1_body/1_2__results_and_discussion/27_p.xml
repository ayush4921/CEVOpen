<p>From 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01288-f007">Figure 7</xref> we can observe that if coefficients tend to zero for the ecosystem model (which comprises Mediterranean bush, arable land, or pasture), it is possible to identify which variables depend significantly on land type where genotypes developed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01288-f005">Figure 5</xref>). In this case, some terpenes in essential oils play a role. In fact, these terpenes help plants to survive at very high temperatures and lack of water, protecting the photosynthesis apparatus from excess radiation, and contributing to the plantâ€™s adaptation to environmental stresses; moreover, terpenes may protect against pest attacks (
