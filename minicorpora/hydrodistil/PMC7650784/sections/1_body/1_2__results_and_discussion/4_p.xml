<p>GC/MS analysis of the 
 <italic>leucocarpa</italic> variety (first five accessions in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-09-01288">Table S1</xref>) showed a wide variability, and the main components (
 <xref rid="plants-09-01288-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) were α-pinene, limonene, and 1,8-cineole. In RUM14, α-pinene reached a high concentration, and the lowest was in V8, while limonene was characterized in V3 and V8 selections with high concentrations. The majority of 1,8-cineole was concentrated in V8 and RUM6. It is interesting to note that linalyl acetate was present only in RUM14.
