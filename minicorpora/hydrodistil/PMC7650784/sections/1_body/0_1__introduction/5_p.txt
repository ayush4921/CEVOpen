0: To achieve this aim, a chemometric method was applied.
1: For this purpose, the experimental data were analyzed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and orthogonal projection methods, in particular Orthogonal Partial Latent Structure Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA), which is a highly accurate statistical method and is a powerful modelling tool.
2: It provides insights into the separations between experimental groups, based on high-dimensional spectral measurements obtained with NMR, MS, or other analytical instrumentation [ 18].
3: In particular, in OPLS, continuous variable data were separated into predictive and unrelated information.
4: This allows one to improve and facilitate diagnostic interpretations and obtain a more intuitive visualization [ 19].
5: However, these changes only improve the interpretability, not predictability, of Partial Least-Squares regression (PLS) models.
6: The best is the OPLS-DA (Discriminant Analysis) method that can be applied when working with discrete variables, such as in classification and biomarker studies.
7: In OPLS-DA, objects are classified into group clusters with predetermined models for the class.
8: This is an excellent tool for finding "What is the difference" between two groups (like Good and Bad products).
9: The OPLS-DA model indicates the driving forces between variables.
10: Therefore, we can create graphs (score plots) to visualize differences if these exist.
11: We can also use graphics that can display variables that express this difference (loading plots).
