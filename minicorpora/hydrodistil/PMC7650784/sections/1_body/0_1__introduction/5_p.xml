<p>To achieve this aim, a chemometric method was applied. For this purpose, the experimental data were analyzed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and orthogonal projection methods, in particular Orthogonal Partial Latent Structure Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA), which is a highly accurate statistical method and is a powerful modelling tool. It provides insights into the separations between experimental groups, based on high-dimensional spectral measurements obtained with NMR, MS, or other analytical instrumentation [

The best is the OPLS-DA (Discriminant Analysis) method that can be applied when working with discrete variables, such as in classification and biomarker studies. In OPLS-DA, objects are classified into group clusters with predetermined models for the class. This is an excellent tool for finding "What is the difference" between two groups (like Good and Bad products). The OPLS-DA model indicates the driving forces between variables. Therefore, we can create graphs (score plots) to visualize differences if these exist. We can also use graphics that can display variables that express this difference (loading plots).
