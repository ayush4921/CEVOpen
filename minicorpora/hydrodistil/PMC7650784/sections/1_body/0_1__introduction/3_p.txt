0: The chemical components of the essential oils obtained from all tissues of the plant determine the antioxidant, antibiotic, and antimutagenic properties of the Myrtle biomass [ 11, 12, 13].
1: Several studies have indicated the activities of Myrtle chemical components [ 14, 15].
2: It is known that intraspecific variability and environmental conditions can significantly influence the qualitative and quantitative levels of major compounds of essential oils that characterize a plant species.
3: Based on the aim of selecting a commercially exploitable cultivar, considerable effort has been dedicated to collecting wild plants (with good qualitative and quantitative production) around all Sardinia, and to their agamic propagation.
4: Candidate clone-lines in this first mass-selection step were planted in a comparison field, where the best genotypes were described, tested as cultivars, and proposed to the nursery market [ 16, 17].
5: Another selection group (named V + code number) was obtained by open pollination of some previously selected candidate clones, sowing of the hybrids, transplanting a lot of seedlings in a plot, and after some years, the selection of new candidate clones by agamic propagation in a new plot ( Table 1).
6: All these selections are still cultivated in the Fenosu experimental field and represent a wide population we can use to investigate chemical variations in these genotypes ( Figure 1,  Table 1).
7: In this field, the production of different chemical profiles, in all parts of these plants, is regulated only by genetic differences because environmental conditions are the same for all populations.
