<p>In this study, we investigated the intra-specific variability of essential oil compositions in a population of 52 
 <italic>M. communis</italic> L. selections in order to characterize the chemical profiles among different samples of the same species in the population. The purpose was to test whether the intra-specific genetic variability of this species was influenced by geographic, soil, and/or environmental factors fixed in the mother plants from which the genotype collection was derived.
