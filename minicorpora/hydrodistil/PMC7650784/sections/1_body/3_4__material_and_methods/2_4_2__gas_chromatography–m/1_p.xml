 </bold> Three replicates of each sample were analyzed by using a Hewlett-Packard Model 5890A GC, equipped with a flame ionization detector and fitted with a 60 m × 0.25 mm (I.D.), thickness 0.25 μm ZB-5 fused silica capillary column (Phenomenex, Torrance CA, USA). The injection port and detector temperatures were maintained at 280 °C. The column temperature was programmed from 50 °C to 135 °C at 5 °C/min (1 min), 5 °C/min up to 225 °C (5 min), 5 °C/min up to 260 °C, and then held for 10 min. Samples of 0.2 μL (volume injection) were analyzed and diluted in hexane using 2,6-dimethylphenol as internal standard. Injection was undertaken using a split/splitless HP 7673 automatic injector and helium as carrier gas. Several measurements of peak area were performed with a HP workstation with a threshold set to 0 and peak width 0.02. Quantization of each compound was expressed as absolute weight percentage using the internal standard and response factors (RFs). The detector RFs were determined for key components relative to 2,6-dimethylphenol and assigned to other components based on functional group and/or structural similarity, since oxygenated compounds have a lower detectability by FID (Flame Ionization Detector) than hydrocarbons. Standards (Sigma-Aldrich, Fluka and Merck grade) were &gt;95%, and the actual purity was checked by GC. Several response factor solutions were prepared that consisted of only four or five components (plus 2,6-dimethylphenol) to prevent interference from trace impurities. It is known that oxygenated compounds have a lower sensitivity than hydrocarbons to FID. We calculated the response factor using a standard mixture of α-pinene, α-terpineol, nerol, geranial, geranyl acetate, and caryophyllene. The mixture accounted terpenes for 92%, aldehydes 5%, and alcohols, esters, and sesquiterpenes 1% each. In our analyses we obtained a hydrocarbon RF equal to 1, while for alcohols it was 0.80, and for esters 0.71. For this reason we multiplied experimental data with the following correction factors: 1 for hydrocarbons, 1.24 for aldehydes and ketones, 1.28 for alcohols, and 1.408 for esters.
