0: GC/MS.
1: MS analyses were carried out with an Agilent Technologies model 7820A connected to an MS detector 5977E MSD (Agilent), using the same conditions and column described above.
2: The column was connected to a mass spectrometer ion source.
3: Mass units were monitored from 10 to 900 AMU at 70 eV.
4: For the identification procedure we considered only peaks from 40 to 900 AMU.
5: Identification of constituents was based on comparisons of Kovats index values and mass spectra with those obtained from the authentic samples and/or Nist and Wiley library spectra, or based on interpretation of the EI fragmentation of the molecules [ 25, 26].
