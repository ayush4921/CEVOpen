0: GC.
1: Three replicates of each sample were analyzed by using a Hewlett-Packard Model 5890A GC, equipped with a flame ionization detector and fitted with a 60 m  0.25 mm (I.D.
2: ), thickness 0.25 m ZB-5 fused silica capillary column (Phenomenex, Torrance CA, USA).
3: The injection port and detector temperatures were maintained at 280 C. The column temperature was programmed from 50 C to 135 C at 5 C/min (1 min), 5 C/min up to 225 C (5 min), 5 C/min up to 260 C, and then held for 10 min.
4: Samples of 0.2 L (volume injection) were analyzed and diluted in hexane using 2,6-dimethylphenol as internal standard.
5: Injection was undertaken using a split/splitless HP 7673 automatic injector and helium as carrier gas.
6: Several measurements of peak area were performed with a HP workstation with a threshold set to 0 and peak width 0.02.
7: Quantization of each compound was expressed as absolute weight percentage using the internal standard and response factors (RFs).
8: The detector RFs were determined for key components relative to 2,6-dimethylphenol and assigned to other components based on functional group and/or structural similarity, since oxygenated compounds have a lower detectability by FID (Flame Ionization Detector) than hydrocarbons.
9: Standards (Sigma-Aldrich, Fluka and Merck grade) were >95%, and the actual purity was checked by GC.
10: Several response factor solutions were prepared that consisted of only four or five components (plus 2,6-dimethylphenol) to prevent interference from trace impurities.
11: It is known that oxygenated compounds have a lower sensitivity than hydrocarbons to FID.
12: We calculated the response factor using a standard mixture of -pinene, -terpineol, nerol, geranial, geranyl acetate, and caryophyllene.
13: The mixture accounted terpenes for 92%, aldehydes 5%, and alcohols, esters, and sesquiterpenes 1% each.
14: In our analyses we obtained a hydrocarbon RF equal to 1, while for alcohols it was 0.80, and for esters 0.71.
15: For this reason we multiplied experimental data with the following correction factors: 1 for hydrocarbons, 1.24 for aldehydes and ketones, 1.28 for alcohols, and 1.408 for esters.
