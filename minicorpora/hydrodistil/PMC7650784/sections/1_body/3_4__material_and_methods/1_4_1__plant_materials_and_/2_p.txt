0: To avoid harvesting an unrepresentative sample, we collected leaves from the entire plant, collecting material from the top, from the sides, and from the base in triplicate.
1: In the laboratory, the plant material was cleaned of foreign parts (little branches, unripe fruits, residues of flowers), and samples were made as uniform as possible.
2: From every cultivar, about 3 kg of leaves was collected and divided into three parts to replicate analyses.
3: After harvest, clean leaves were kept in a freezer at 20 C until extraction.
4: Essential oil samples were obtained from leaves via hydrodistillation for 4 h using a Clevenger-type apparatus.
5: For every selection three extractions were performed.
6: Extraction yields were calculated as gkg 1 of fresh material.
7: Oils were stored in sealed vials, at 20 C, until chemical analysis.
