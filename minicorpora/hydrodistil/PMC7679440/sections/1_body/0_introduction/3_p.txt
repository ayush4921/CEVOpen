0: Tarchonanthus camphoratus L. (family  Asteraceae) is found in a wide range of environments (e.g., Africa and Arabia), has a grayish appearance, and can grow to be about six meters in height ( Van Wyk et al., 1997).
1: Its leaves have been traditionally used to relieve bronchitis, asthma, headaches, inflammation, and abdominal pains ( Amabeoku et al., 2000).
2: The essential oil found in  T. camphoratus displays a wide variety of biological properties (e.g., antidiabetic, antimicrobial, antifungal, antioxidant, insecticidal) ( Van Vuuren and Viljoen, 2009,  Ireri et al., 2010,  Aiyegoro and Van Dyk, 2011).
3: Oxygenated sesquiterpene and monoterpenes have been documented to be the major constituents of the  T. camphoratus essential oil (TCEO) ( Ali et al., 2013).
4: Other phytochemical investigations on the  T. camphoratus have detected the presence of reducing sugars, saponins and tannins ( Van Wyk et al., 1997).
5: The cytotoxic activity of  T. camphoratus that has been grown in different regions, using different cell lines has also been reported ( Mothana et al., 2009,  Aiyegoro and Van Dyk, 2011,  Ali et al., 2013).
6: According to our literature survey, only some alkaloid and flavones were isolated and characterized from  T. camphoratus grown in Saudi Arabia by  Bishay et al.
7: (2002).
8: However, no report was found regarding the chemical constituents, cytotoxic and apoptosis effects of the essential oils of  T. camphoratus grown in Saudi Arabia have been published.
9: Therefore, the goal of this study was to determine the chemical profile of the TCEO using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, while exploring its anticancer activities.
