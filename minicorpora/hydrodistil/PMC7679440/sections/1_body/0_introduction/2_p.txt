0: Cancer remains a prevalent, life threatening disease with a high mortality rate worldwide ( Siegel et al., 2020).
1: Despite great advances in pharmacology and synthetic drugs, conventional cancer treatments often require highly toxic drugs that have many adverse side effects.
2: Natural products, particularly plants, may be an ideal choice for some patients due to their natural properties ( Desai et al., 2008).
3: Essential oils (EO) have been used in the prevention or therapy of several diseases, due to their preservative and medicinal properties.
4: The bioactivity of EO as an antidiabetic, antioxidant, antibacterial, and antiviral have been reported ( Edris, 2007).
5: In cancer research, plant EO represent an attractive source of new anticancer compounds that have potential therapeutic applications in chemoprevention.
6: Considered to potentially be more effective than traditional cancer treatments, EO selectively interact with various pathways and cellular mechanisms in a manner that may create synergistic results ( Edris, 2007,  Bhalla et al., 2013,  Blowman et al., 2018).
