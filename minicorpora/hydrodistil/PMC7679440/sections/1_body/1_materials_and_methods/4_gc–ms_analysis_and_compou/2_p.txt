0: The chemical constituents of TCEO were determined using gas chromatography and a mass spectrometer (Turbomass, PerkinElmer, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA).
1: The temperature program was set to 40 C, followed by a 2 min hold, then raised to 200 C at a rate of 5 C min 1, which was also then put on hold for 2 min.
2: From 200 C, the temperature was raised by 5 C min 1 to 300 C and held for another 2 min.
3: The TCEO chemical composition were determined by comparing the mass spectra obtained with the mass spectra from the National Institute of Standard and Technology and WILEY Spectral libraries.
4: The mass spectra TCEO compounds were also compared with those of similar compounds in the Adams Library ( Adams, 2007) and the Wiley GC/MS Library ( McLafferty and Stauffer, 1989).
