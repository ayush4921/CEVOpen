0: The proliferation of breast (MCF-7), liver (HepG2), lung (A549) cancer cell lines, and non-tumorigenic (HUVEC) cells were assessed using MTT assay, according to  Kumar et al., (2018), with slight modification.
1: In 96-well plates, cells were plated at 1  10 5 cell/ml, then incubated for 24 h. TCEO at 12.5, 25, 50, 100 and 200 g/mL was added after 24 h of incubation, then allowed to incubate for another 24 h. After 48 h of incubation, MTT solution (5 mg/ml) was added (10 L/well) and incubated for 24 h at 37 C. After the incubation, formazan crystals end product was dissolved with 0.1 mL acidified isopropanol, and the plate was put on a shaker for 1015 min.
2: The plate was read using a plate reader (BioTek, USA) at 570 nm.
3: The inhibitory concentration (IC 50) was calculated from the dose-dependent curve using OriginPro 8.5 software.
4: The cell viability percentage was calculated using the following formula: Cell Viability % = (O.D.
5: of TCEO wells/O.D.
6: of untreated wells)  100.
