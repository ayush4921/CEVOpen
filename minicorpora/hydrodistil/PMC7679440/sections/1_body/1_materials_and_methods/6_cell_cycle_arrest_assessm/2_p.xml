 <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">Alqahtani et al., (2020)</xref>. In brief, after a 24 h incubation period for TCEO (12.5 and 25 µg/ mL), both control and treated −7 cells were collected, washed twice with cold PBS, fixed in 70% ethanol (stored at −20 °C), and then stored at 4 °C from 0.5 h to 4 h. Fixed cells were incubated with RNase A (100 μg/mL) for RNA degradation, and propidium iodide (PI) (100 μg/mL) (Sigma) for DNA staining. After a 30 min incubation, the DNA content of the samples were evaluated using a flow cytometer (Cytomics FC 500; Beckman Coulter, CA, USA). Data collection and analysis were performed using CXP software V. 3. 0.
