0: The cell cycle distribution was assessed using MCF-7 according to  Alqahtani et al., (2020).
1: In brief, after a 24 h incubation period for TCEO (12.5 and 25 g/ mL), both control and treated 7 cells were collected, washed twice with cold PBS, fixed in 70% ethanol (stored at 20 C), and then stored at 4 C from 0.5 h to 4 h. Fixed cells were incubated with RNase A (100 g/mL) for RNA degradation, and propidium iodide (PI) (100 g/mL) (Sigma) for DNA staining.
2: After a 30 min incubation, the DNA content of the samples were evaluated using a flow cytometer (Cytomics FC 500; Beckman Coulter, CA, USA).
3: Data collection and analysis were performed using CXP software V. 3.
4: 0.
