 <sup>5</sup> cells/ml) in a 6-well plate were exposed to 12.5 µg/ml or 25 μg/ml concentrations for 24 h. RNA from the exposed and non-exposed MCF-7 cells was extracted using a TRIzol reagent. One microgram of purified RNA was then converted to cDNA using a specific kit (promega transcription system), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Next, qRT-PCR was accomplished in triplicate with specific primers of
