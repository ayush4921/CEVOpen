0: For qRT-PCR analysis, MCF-7 cells (2  10 5 cells/ml) in a 6-well plate were exposed to 12.5 g/ml or 25 g/ml concentrations for 24 h. RNA from the exposed and non-exposed MCF-7 cells was extracted using a TRIzol reagent.
1: One microgram of purified RNA was then converted to cDNA using a specific kit (promega transcription system), according to the manufacturers instructions.
2: Next, qRT-PCR was accomplished in triplicate with specific primers of  Bax,  Bcl-2,  P53 and caspases 9,8,3 using Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Life Technologies, CA, USA) according to  Semlali et al., (2016).
