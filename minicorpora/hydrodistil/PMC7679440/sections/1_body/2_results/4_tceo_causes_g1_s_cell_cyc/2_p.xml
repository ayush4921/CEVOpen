<p id="p0070">To explore whether TCEO proliferation inhibition on MCF-7 cells causes cell cycle arrest, flow cytometric exploration with PI staining was performed. As shown in 
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, dose-dependent increases in the Gl phase of treated MCF-7 cells was observed. The G1 phase cells proportion increased approximately by 5% and 16% in the presence of 12.5 and 25 μg/mL of TCEO, respectively, compared with the control. This increase was conjugated with significantly fewer cells in the other phases (
