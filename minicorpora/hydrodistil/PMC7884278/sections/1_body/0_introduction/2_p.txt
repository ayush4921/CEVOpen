0: In the past, antibacterial properties were mainly reported by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) which is described as the lowest concentration of an agent to prevent bacterial visible growth ( 12).
1: For instance, the MIC of  Artemisia dracunculus EO on  S. aureus was 62.4 mg.mL 1 ( 13).
2: Besides,  Anethum graveolens EO showed a good antibacterial effect on  E. coli with MIC of 2.5 mg.mL 1 ( 14).
3: However, by developing optical density (OD) dependent technics, the growth of microorganisms was observed as turbidity, determined by analytical instruments ( 15).
4: By investigating the antibacterial activity of active agents at various concentrations and using software such as CalcuSyn, half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50) is measurable.
5: This value is defined as observing a 50% decrease in bacterial growth in the treated sample compared to the control group.
6: It is a reliable and quantitative unit with upper and lower confidence limits ( 16).
