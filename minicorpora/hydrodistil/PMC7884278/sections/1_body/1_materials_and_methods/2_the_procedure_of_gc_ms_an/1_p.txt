0: For the identification of ingredients of the EOs, GC-MS analysis was used.
1: Briefly, The GC-MS analyses were performed using a 7890A Network GC system coupled with 5975C VL MSD with Triple-Axis, mass selective detector (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA).
2: The separation of the components of the EOs was carried out on HP-5MS silica fused columns (30 m length; 0.25 mm i.d.
3: ; and 25 M film thickness).
4: The GC-MS column temp was programmed as follows: the initial temp was set at 40C and fixed for 1 min, then increased with the rate of 3C.min 1 to the final temperature of 250C and held for 20 min.
5: Temperature of the injection port and detector fixed at 250 and 230C, respectively.
6: Other instrument parameters were set as split flow: 100 mL.min 1 and column flow rate: 1 mL.min 1.
7: Helium gas with a purity of 99.99% was used as the carrier gas.
8: The EOs components were identified using the method described in our previous report ( 17).
