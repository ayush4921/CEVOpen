<p>For the identification of ingredients of the EOs, GC-MS analysis was used. Briefly, The GC-MS analyses were performed using a 7890A Network GC system coupled with 5975C VL MSD with Triple-Axis, mass selective detector (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The separation of the components of the EOs was carried out on HP-5MS silica fused columns (30 m length; 0.25 mm i.d.; and 25 µM film thickness). The GC-MS column temp was programmed as follows: the initial temp was set at 40°C and fixed for 1 min, then increased with the rate of 3°C.min
 <sup>–1</sup> to the final temperature of 250°C and held for 20 min. Temperature of the injection port and detector fixed at 250 and 230°C, respectively. Other instrument parameters were set as split flow: 100 mL.min
 <sup>–1</sup> and column flow rate: 1 mL.min
 <sup>–1</sup>. Helium gas with a purity of 99.99% was used as the carrier gas. The EOs components were identified using the method described in our previous report (
