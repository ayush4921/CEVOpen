0: 96-well plate microdilution method was used for determining the growth inhibitory effect of EOs against target bacteria with slight modification ( 15,  18).
1: New cultured bacterial colonies (overnight culture) were suspended in Muller Hinton broth to reach 1.5  10 8 CFU/mL to reach the level of 0.5 McFarland turbidity.
2: Then 20 L of the bacterial suspension was added to each well using an 8-channel pipette.
