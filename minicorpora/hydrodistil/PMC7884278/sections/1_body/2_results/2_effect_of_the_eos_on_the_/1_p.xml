<p>The effect of ADEO at different concentrations (0.03–8.00 mg.mL
 <sup>–1</sup>) on the targeted bacterial growth is depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>. The best result was observed at a concentration of 8.00 mg.mL
 <sup>–1</sup> against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>; the growth was reduced to ~ 17%, while 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> were decreased to 36, 47 and 69%, respectively. From the literature, MIC of ADEO on 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> were reported as 1.25 and 2.50 mg.mL
 <sup>–1</sup> (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Moreover, its zone of inhabitation in the disk diffusion approach was reported as 8 mm for 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 10 mm for 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).
