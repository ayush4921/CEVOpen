<p>After 24 h exposure with CZEO (8.00 mg.mL
 <sup>–1</sup>), the growth of bacteria had a substantial difference from each other (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). For instance, the observed growth for 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> was around 15%, while this amount for 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> was 71%. This value for the other bacteria falls between those values (
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>: 53% and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>: 40%). Antibacterial effect (MIC mg.mL
 <sup>–1</sup>) of CZEO on such bacteria, i.e., 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (1.6), 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> (3.2), 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (0.8), and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (3.2) was reported previously (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).
