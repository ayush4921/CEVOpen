  <title>Background and Objectives:</title>
  <p>Essential oils (EOs) with different biological activities, such as antibacterial properties, are a valuable resource for developing new drugs.</p>
 </sec>
 <sec>
  <title>Materials and Methods:</title>
  <p>Ingredients of six medicinally important EOs, including 
   <italic>Artemisia dracunculus, Anethum graveolens, Citrus limon, Citrus sinensis, Cinnamomum zeylanicum</italic> and 
   <italic>Zingiber officinale</italic>, were identified using GC-MS analysis. Moreover, their five major compounds were also listed. Furthermore, the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
   <sub>50</sub>) against four important human bacteria was also investigated using the 96-well plate microdilution.

  <title>Results:</title>
  <p>
   <italic>C. sinensis</italic> EO with IC
   <sub>50</sub> of 1.0 and 4.7 mg.mL
   <sup>–1</sup> have the most effect on the growth of 
   <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
   <italic>P. aeruginosa.</italic> Moreover, EOs of 
   <italic>Cinnamomum zeylanicum</italic> (IC
   <sub>50</sub>: 1.0 mg. Ml
   <sup>–1</sup>) and 
   <italic>Artemisia dracunculus</italic> (IC
   <sub>50</sub>: 1.3 mg.mL
   <sup>–1</sup>) significantly showed better inhibitory effect on 
   <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
   <italic>K. pneumoniae.</italic>
  </p>
 </sec>
 <sec>
  <title>Conclusion:</title>
  <p>These EOs could be used for developing inexpensive, potent, and green antibacterial agents.</p>
