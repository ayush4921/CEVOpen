 <p>Acne is a common skin condition observed in adolescents. Nutmeg (
  <italic>Myristica fragrans</italic> Houtt) (MF) is a well-known traditional Chinese medicine; its major toxic components, safrole and myristicin, are rich in essential oils. Essential oils of MF (MFO) were extracted by hydrodistillation; the residue was extracted using 50% methanol (MFE-M). The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of MFE-M against 
  <italic>Cutibacterium acnes</italic> and 
  <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> was 0.64 mg. Four compounds were obtained from MFE-M: myristicin (

  <sup>8′</sup>-7-acetoxy-3,4,3′,5′-tetramethoxy-8-
  <italic>O</italic>-4′-neolignan (
  <bold>4</bold>). Compound 
  <bold>2</bold> exerted the strongest antimicrobial activity, with MICs of 6.25 and 3.12 μg/mL against 
  <italic>C. acnes</italic> and 
  <italic>S. aureus</italic>, respectively. Moreover, 
  <bold>2</bold> inhibited NO, PGE
  <sub>2</sub>, iNOS, and COX-2 levels in RAW 264.7 cells induced by LPS or heat-killed 
  <italic>C. acnes</italic>; NO production at 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC
  <sub>50</sub>) was 11.07 and 11.53 μg/mL, respectively. Myristicin and safrole content was higher in MFO than in MFE-M. MFO and MFE-M caused no skin irritation after a single topical application in Wistar rats. MFE-M, with low safrole and myristicin content, did not cause skin irritation and exhibited an anti-acne effect; moreover, 
  <bold>2</bold> was identified as the active substance. Therefore, MFE-M could be employed to develop anti-acne compounds for use in cosmetics.
