<p>First, the 
 <italic>M. fragrans</italic> oil (MFO), MFE-M, MFE-H, and MFE-E were tested against 
 <italic>C. acnes</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> by determining the inhibition ratio using the broth dilution method. MFE-M and MFE-E showed antibacterial activities based on the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 0.64 and 0.02 mg/mL, respectively. The MIC values of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> were 0.64 and 0.16 mg/mL, respectively. MFE-E exhibited significant antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>C. acnes</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. The inhibition ratios of MFE-E at 100 Âµg/mL were 114.53% and 56.29%, respectively.
