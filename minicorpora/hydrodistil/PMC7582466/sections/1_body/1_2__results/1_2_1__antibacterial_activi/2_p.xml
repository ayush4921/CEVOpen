<p>The antibacterial bioassay-guided fractionation flowchart of nutmeg is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04563-f001">Figure 1</xref>. The following four phytochemicals were identified: one alkenyl-benzene (
 <bold>1</bold>) and three neolignans (
 <bold>2</bold>, 
 <bold>3</bold>, and 
 <bold>4</bold>) from nutmeg. The yields of the four phytochemicals were 0.025% (
 <bold>1</bold>), 0.00005% (
 <bold>2</bold>), 0.0025% (
 <bold>3</bold>), and 0.0042% (
 <bold>4</bold>), respectively. The antibacterial effects were evaluated as previously described. The MICs of the four phytochemicals against 
 <italic>C. acnes</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> are shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04563-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Compound 2 displayed a more potent antibacterial activity than that exhibited by other compounds.
