<p>Moreover, in this study, we used heat-killed 
 <italic>C. acnes</italic> (HKC) instead of LPS to simulate the irritation and inflammation caused by 
 <italic>C. acne</italic> infection. Compound 
 <bold>2</bold> at 6.25.50 μg/mL exerted NO inhibitory effects against HKC-induced RAW 264.7 cells. Further, its IC
 <sub>50</sub> value was 11.53 μg/mL (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04563-f003">Figure 3</xref>A). Compound 
 <bold>2</bold> also significantly inhibited PGE
 <sub>2</sub> production in HKC-treated RAW 264.7 cells in a dose-dependent manner (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04563-f003">Figure 3</xref>B). Among the compounds, 
 <bold>2</bold> exhibited good inhibitory effects on iNOS and COX-2 expression at 8 or 24 h (
