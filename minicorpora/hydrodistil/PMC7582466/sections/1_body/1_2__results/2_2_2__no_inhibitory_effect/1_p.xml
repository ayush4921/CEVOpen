<p>The NO inhibitory effects of MFE-M, MFE-H, and MFE-E were determined in LPS-treated RAW 264.7 cells for 18 h. NO levels were detected in culture medium using the Griess reaction. Survival rates were determined using the MTT assay. The three extracts showed no cytotoxicity at 25 µg/mL. The NO inhibitory rates of MFE-M and MFE-E were 34.93 ± 6.76% and 83.58. ± 2.88%, respectively. MFE-H did not exhibit any NO inhibitory effect (

 <sub>2</sub> inhibitory effects compared to the other compounds and had an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 6.25 µg/mL (

 <sub>2</sub> production in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells. The three neolignans at a concentration of 12.5 μg/mL were found to show less than 10% cytotoxicity. The NO inhibitory rates were 61.11% ± 5.19%, 27.78% ± 10.17%, and 43.65% ± 1.37%, respectively. Compound 
 <bold>2</bold> displayed a more potent NO inhibition than the other compounds, and its IC
 <sub>50</sub> value was 11.07 μg/mL.
