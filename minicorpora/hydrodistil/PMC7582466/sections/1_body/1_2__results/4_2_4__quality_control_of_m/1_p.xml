<p>Calibration curves were plotted using the peak areas. The calibration curve of myristicin was y = 55,665x âˆ’ 252,568 and its R square value was R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.9986, while the calibration curve of safrole was y = 13,798x + 50,255 and its R square value was R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.9943. Safrole contained 4.46% and 0.01% MFO and MFE-M, respectively, while myristicin contained 2.62% and 2.49% MFO and MFE-M, respectively (
