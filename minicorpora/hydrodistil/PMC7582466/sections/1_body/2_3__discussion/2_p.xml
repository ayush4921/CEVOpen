<p>To quickly remove the toxic components of nutmeg and increase its efficacy, steam distillation was employed to remove the essential oil, and extraction was performed with 50% methanol. Using high-performance liquid chromatography as an analysis method, the content of safrole was found to be much lower in MFE-M than in MFO. Additionally, only 2.49% of the myristicin remained in the MFE-M. Silica gel column chromatography with the elution solvent, 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane: Ethyl acetate (EA) = 20:1, was further employed to remove myristicin from MFE-M. Here, we found that the active ingredient, (+)-

 <italic>C. acnes</italic>-treated RAW 264.7 cells. In the present study, we developed a safe and good anti-acne nutmeg extract.
