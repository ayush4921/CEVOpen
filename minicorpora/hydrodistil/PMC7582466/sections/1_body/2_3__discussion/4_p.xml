<p>In the treatment of acne, topical treatment is safer than oral treatment because of its lower side effects. Accordingly, the MFO and MFE-E extracts were further evaluated via a single topical application in Wistar rats. The results showed that high doses of MFO resulted in nonirritating effects. Furthermore, the high concentration of MFE-E did not cause toxicity in the skin. Collectively, our findings indicate that the essential oil of nutmeg is a common source of spices but exhibits different toxicities and side effects. To our knowledge, this study is the first to evaluate the anti-acne effect of degreasing nutmeg. MFE-E could thus be used as a source to develop external anti-acne medicines and cosmetics and may function as additives in cleaning products.</p>
