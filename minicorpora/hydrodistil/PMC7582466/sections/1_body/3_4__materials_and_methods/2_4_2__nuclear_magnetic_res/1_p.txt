0: 1H (500 MHz) and  13C NMR (126 MHz) spectra were generated on a Bruker DRX 500 spectrometric system using CDCl 3 as the solvent, and chemical shifts are given in  (ppm) values.
1: Two-dimensional NMR spectra ( 1H 1H COSY, HMQC, HMBC, NOESY) were obtained using a Bruker DRX 500 spectrometer using standard Bruker pulse sequences (Bruker, Rheinstetten, Germany).
2: Electrospray ionization mass spectra (ESI-MS) were analyzed using the SCIEX API-4000 Q system (Sciex Division of MDS, Toronto, ON, Canada).
