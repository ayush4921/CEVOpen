 <sup>1</sup>H (500 MHz) and 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR (126 MHz) spectra were generated on a Bruker DRX 500 spectrometric system using CDCl
 <sub>3</sub> as the solvent, and chemical shifts are given in δ (ppm) values. Two-dimensional NMR spectra (
 <sup>1</sup>H–
 <sup>1</sup>H COSY, HMQC, HMBC, NOESY) were obtained using a Bruker DRX 500 spectrometer using standard Bruker pulse sequences (Bruker, Rheinstetten, Germany). Electrospray ionization mass spectra (ESI-MS) were analyzed using the SCIEX API-4000 Q system (Sciex Division of MDS, Toronto, ON, Canada).
