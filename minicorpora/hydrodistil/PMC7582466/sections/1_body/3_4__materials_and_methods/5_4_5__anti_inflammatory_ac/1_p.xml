<p>The anti-inflammatory activities of the compounds were evaluated in RAW 264.7 cells cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS, 1% L-glutamine, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere. RAW 264.7 cells (4.0 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/mL) were seeded in 96-well plates and co-treated with LPS (500 ng/mL) and the test samples. After 24 h, NO production was determined with Griess reagent, and the absorption was detected at 530 nm. The inhibitory percentage of NO production was presented as an anti-inflammatory activity. Prostaglandin E
 <sub>2</sub> (PGE
 <sub>2</sub>) concentrations in the cell culture media were determined using a PGE
 <sub>2</sub> enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY, USA). The survival rate of RAW 264.7 cells was detected by an MTT assay.
