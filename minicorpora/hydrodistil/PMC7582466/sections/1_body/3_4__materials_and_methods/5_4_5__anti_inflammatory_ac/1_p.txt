0: The anti-inflammatory activities of the compounds were evaluated in RAW 264.7 cells cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS, 1% L-glutamine, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and maintained at 37 C in a 5% CO 2 atmosphere.
1: RAW 264.7 cells (4.0  10 5 cells/mL) were seeded in 96-well plates and co-treated with LPS (500 ng/mL) and the test samples.
2: After 24 h, NO production was determined with Griess reagent, and the absorption was detected at 530 nm.
3: The inhibitory percentage of NO production was presented as an anti-inflammatory activity.
4: Prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) concentrations in the cell culture media were determined using a PGE 2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY, USA).
5: The survival rate of RAW 264.7 cells was detected by an MTT assay.
