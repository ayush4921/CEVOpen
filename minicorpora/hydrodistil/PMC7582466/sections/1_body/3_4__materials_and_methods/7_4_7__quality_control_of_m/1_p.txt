0: The HPLC apparatus included an SCL-10Avp system  controller, an LC-10ATvp liquid chromatographic pump, an SPD-M10A diode array detector, an SIL-10Avp auto-injector, a CTO-10A column oven, FCV-10Avp flow-channel selection valves (Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan), and an ERC-3415 degasser (ERC, Altegolfsheim, Regensburg, Germany).
1: The stationary phase comprised a Purospher  STAR RP-18e reverse-phase column (4 mm i.d.
2: 250 mm, 5 m, Merck, Kenilworth, NJ, USA), and the mobile phase system included 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid : CH 3CN isocratic at a ratio of 40:60.
3: The flow rate was 1 mL/min, and the column oven temperature was maintained at 40 C. The ultraviolet wavelength was set to 220 nm to detect myristicin and safrole in MFO and MFE-M.
4: The concentration range of myristicin and safrole was 0.78 to 1000 g/mL.
