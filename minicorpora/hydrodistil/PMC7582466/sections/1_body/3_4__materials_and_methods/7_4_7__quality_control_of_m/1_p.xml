<p>The HPLC apparatus included an SCL-10Avp system 
 <italic>controller</italic>, an LC-10ATvp liquid chromatographic pump, an SPD-M10A diode array detector, an SIL-10Avp auto-injector, a CTO-10A column oven, FCV-10Avp flow-channel selection valves (Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan), and an ERC-3415 degasser (ERC, Altegolfsheim, Regensburg, Germany). The stationary phase comprised a Purospher
 <sup>®</sup> STAR RP-18e reverse-phase column (4 mm i.d. × 250 mm, 5 μm, Merck, Kenilworth, NJ, USA), and the mobile phase system included 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid : CH
 <sub>3</sub>CN isocratic at a ratio of 40:60. The flow rate was 1 mL/min, and the column oven temperature was maintained at 40 °C. The ultraviolet wavelength was set to 220 nm to detect myristicin and safrole in MFO and MFE-M. The concentration range of myristicin and safrole was 0.78 to 1000 μg/mL.
