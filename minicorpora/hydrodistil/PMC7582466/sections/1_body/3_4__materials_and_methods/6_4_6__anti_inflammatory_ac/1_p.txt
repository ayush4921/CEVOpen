0: C. acnes (4  10 8 cfu/mL) was heated to 80 C for 30 min to kill the bacteria.
1: HKC was freeze-dried as a powder and maintained at 4 C until use.
2: RAW 264.7 cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 1%  l-glutamine at 37 C in a 5% CO 2 atmosphere.
3: RAW 264.7 cells (4  10 5 cells/mL) were seeded in six-well plates and co-treated with HKC (300 g/mL) and test samples.
4: NO and PGE 2 production were determined according to previously described methods [ 20].
5: Whole-cell lysates were prepared via lysis with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer.
6: The proteins in the lysate (30 g) were denatured in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) sample buffer and analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE.
7: Gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and probed with primary iNOS (clone N-20), COX-2 (clone C-20), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; clone 6C5) antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA).
8: Membranes were visualized with a BCIP/NBT kit (Gibco BRL, Grand Island, NY, USA).
9: The level of protein expression was quantified using an Azure Biosystem C300 Imaging System.
10: GAPDH expression was used as an internal control to compare the protein expression of iNOS and COX-2.
