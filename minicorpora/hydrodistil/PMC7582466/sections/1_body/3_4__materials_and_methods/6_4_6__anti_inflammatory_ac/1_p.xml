 <sup>8</sup> cfu/mL) was heated to 80 °C for 30 min to kill the bacteria. HKC was freeze-dried as a powder and maintained at 4 °C until use. RAW 264.7 cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 1% 
 <sc>l</sc>-glutamine at 37 °C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere. RAW 264.7 cells (4 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/mL) were seeded in six-well plates and co-treated with HKC (300 μg/mL) and test samples. NO and PGE
 <sub>2</sub> production were determined according to previously described methods [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-25-04563" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Whole-cell lysates were prepared via lysis with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer. The proteins in the lysate (30 μg) were denatured in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) sample buffer and analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE. Gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and probed with primary iNOS (clone N-20), COX-2 (clone C-20), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; clone 6C5) antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Membranes were visualized with a BCIP/NBT kit (Gibco BRL, Grand Island, NY, USA). The level of protein expression was quantified using an Azure Biosystem C300 Imaging System. GAPDH expression was used as an internal control to compare the protein expression of iNOS and COX-2.
