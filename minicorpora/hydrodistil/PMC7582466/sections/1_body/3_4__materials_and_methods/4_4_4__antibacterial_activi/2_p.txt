0: The experimental protocol followed a previous report with modifications [ 18].
1: MFO, MFE-M, MFE-E, MFE-H, and compounds  1,  2,  3, and  4 were tested against  C. acnes by determining the MIC values through the broth-dilution method [ 19].
2: A freshly grown culture was diluted with BactoTM TSB, and 1 mL of the prepared bacteria (4  10 8 CFU/mL).
3: Triton X-100 was used as a positive control.
4: Samples were diluted in sterile broth and then mixed with broth inoculated with  C. acnes.
5: Dilutions were prepared at 10-fold the desired final concentration.
6: The test concentrations of MFE-M, MFE-E, and MFE-H were 0.02.10.24 mg/mL.
7: The test concentrations of compounds  1,  2,  3 and  4 were 3.12100 g/mL.
8: Test samples were incubated under anaerobic conditions at 37 C for 24 h until visible growth of the test microorganisms was observed in the control.
9: The O.D.
10: value was measured using an ELISA reader at 600 nm.
11: The inhibition ratio was compared to that of Triton X-100.
12: The MIC experiment was repeated in triplicate.
13: Moreover,  S. aureus (0.5  10 8 CFU/mL) was prepared.
14: The experimental protocol was the same as that previously described, with some modifications.
15: The antimicrobial activity was expressed as the O.D.
16: value of the inhibition rate against the test microorganisms: Ratio (%) = (O.D.
17: of sample/O.D.
18: Triton X-100)  100.
