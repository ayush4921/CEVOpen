<p>The experimental protocol followed a previous report with modifications [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-25-04563" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. MFO, MFE-M, MFE-E, MFE-H, and compounds 
 <bold>1</bold>, 
 <bold>2</bold>, 
 <bold>3</bold>, and 
 <bold>4</bold> were tested against 
 <italic>C. acnes</italic> by determining the MIC values through the broth-dilution method [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-25-04563" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. A freshly grown culture was diluted with BactoTM TSB, and 1 mL of the prepared bacteria (4 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/mL). Triton X-100 was used as a positive control. Samples were diluted in sterile broth and then mixed with broth inoculated with 
 <italic>C. acnes</italic>. Dilutions were prepared at 10-fold the desired final concentration. The test concentrations of MFE-M, MFE-E, and MFE-H were 0.02.10.24 mg/mL. The test concentrations of compounds 
 <bold>1</bold>, 
 <bold>2</bold>, 
 <bold>3</bold> and 
 <bold>4</bold> were 3.12–100 µg/mL. Test samples were incubated under anaerobic conditions at 37 °C for 24 h until visible growth of the test microorganisms was observed in the control. The O.D. value was measured using an ELISA reader at 600 nm. The inhibition ratio was compared to that of Triton X-100. The MIC experiment was repeated in triplicate. Moreover, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (0.5 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/mL) was prepared. The experimental protocol was the same as that previously described, with some modifications. The antimicrobial activity was expressed as the O.D. value of the inhibition rate against the test microorganisms: Ratio (%) = (O.D. of sample/O.D. Triton X-100) × 100.
