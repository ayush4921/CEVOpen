0: M. fragrans was purchased from Sun Ten Pharmaceutical (New Taipei City, Taiwan) and authenticated by the nonprofit organization Brion Research Institute of Taiwan (New Taipei City, Taiwan).
1: Voucher specimens (MF-01) were identified and deposited at the School of Pharmacy, Taipei Medical University.
2: Dried  M. fragrans (2000 g) was pulverized and filtered through a 20# mesh.
3: M. fragrans oil (MFO) was obtained through hydrodistillation of the dried  M. fragrans in a Clevenger-type apparatus for 2 h, partition with ether, and air-dried.
4: The MFO was stored at 4 C until analysis (69.5 g).
5: The  M. fragrans residue was extracted using 50% aqueous methanol (20 L  3) at 65 C for 2 h. The MeOH extract was evaporated under reduced pressure (~40 C) to produce residual MFE-M (107.7 g).
6: The MFE-M was dissolved in ethyl acetate (MFE-E) and partitioned with distilled water (MFE-H).
7: The EtOAc layer was subjected to column chromatography on silica gel using n-hexane, an n-hexane and EtOAc mixture of increasing polarity, and pure acetone to yield 10 fractions.
8: Fraction 1 ( n-hexane: EA = 20:1) was further purified with silica gel to obtain myristicin ( 1).
9: Fraction 6 ( n-hexane:EA = 3:1) was separated by normal-phase HPLC to yield (+)- erythro- 8-7 S,8 R-dihydroxy-3,3,5-trimethoxy-8- O-4-neolignan ( 2) and was applied to an ODS column eluted with 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid-CH 3CN (47: 53) to obtain (+)- erythro- 8-7-hydroxy- 3,4,3,5-tetramethoxy-8- O-4-neolignan ( 3) and e rythro- 8-7-acetoxy-3,4,3,5-tetramethoxy-8- O-4-neolignan ( 4) ( Figure 1).
