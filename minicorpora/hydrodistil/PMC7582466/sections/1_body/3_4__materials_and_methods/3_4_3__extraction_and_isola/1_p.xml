 <italic>M. fragrans</italic> was purchased from Sun Ten Pharmaceutical (New Taipei City, Taiwan) and authenticated by the nonprofit organization Brion Research Institute of Taiwan (New Taipei City, Taiwan). Voucher specimens (MF-01) were identified and deposited at the School of Pharmacy, Taipei Medical University. Dried 
 <italic>M. fragrans</italic> (2000 g) was pulverized and filtered through a 20# mesh. 
 <italic>M. fragrans</italic> oil (MFO) was obtained through hydrodistillation of the dried 
 <italic>M. fragrans</italic> in a Clevenger-type apparatus for 2 h, partition with ether, and air-dried. The MFO was stored at 4 °C until analysis (69.5 g). The 
 <italic>M. fragrans</italic> residue was extracted using 50% aqueous methanol (20 L × 3) at 65 °C for 2 h. The MeOH extract was evaporated under reduced pressure (~40 °C) to produce residual MFE-M (107.7 g). The MFE-M was dissolved in ethyl acetate (MFE-E) and partitioned with distilled water (MFE-H). The EtOAc layer was subjected to column chromatography on silica gel using n-hexane, an n-hexane and EtOAc mixture of increasing polarity, and pure acetone to yield 10 fractions. Fraction 1 (
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane: EA = 20:1) was further purified with silica gel to obtain myristicin (
 <bold>1</bold>). Fraction 6 (
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane:EA = 3:1) was separated by normal-phase HPLC to yield (+)-
