<p>The skin toxicity of MFO and MFE-E was evaluated by a single topical application in Wistar rats [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-25-04563" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The following animal experiments were conducted according to the Ethical Regulations on Animal Research of Taipei Medical University (approval no. LAC-100-0030). Female Wistar rats (nulliparous, non-pregnant), aged 8–10 weeks and weighing approximately 200–220 g, were purchased from BioLASCO in Taiwan. Rats were maintained at 25 ± 1 °C with food and water 
 <italic>ad libitum</italic> and maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle. At 24 h before the test, the backs of the rats were shaved free of hair (2.5 × 2.5 cm at each site) and checked for any abnormalities (integrity and allergies). An appropriate concentration of MFO and MFE-E (50 μL per sample) was smeared onto the shaved back of a Wistar rat. The patches were secured for a 4-h exposure period and removed with distilled water. At 24 and 48 h after the application of MFO and MFE-E, skin irritation was observed, and the extent of an evident skin allergic reaction was evaluated for each test animal. An acute primary irritation test was performed following the classic Draize test.
