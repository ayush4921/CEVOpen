0: The skin toxicity of MFO and MFE-E was evaluated by a single topical application in Wistar rats [ 21].
1: The following animal experiments were conducted according to the Ethical Regulations on Animal Research of Taipei Medical University (approval no.
2: LAC-100-0030).
3: Female Wistar rats (nulliparous, non-pregnant), aged 810 weeks and weighing approximately 200220 g, were purchased from BioLASCO in Taiwan.
4: Rats were maintained at 25  1 C with food and water  ad libitum and maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle.
5: At 24 h before the test, the backs of the rats were shaved free of hair (2.5  2.5 cm at each site) and checked for any abnormalities (integrity and allergies).
6: An appropriate concentration of MFO and MFE-E (50 L per sample) was smeared onto the shaved back of a Wistar rat.
7: The patches were secured for a 4-h exposure period and removed with distilled water.
8: At 24 and 48 h after the application of MFO and MFE-E, skin irritation was observed, and the extent of an evident skin allergic reaction was evaluated for each test animal.
9: An acute primary irritation test was performed following the classic Draize test.
