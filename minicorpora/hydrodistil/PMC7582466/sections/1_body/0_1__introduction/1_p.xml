<p>Acne, a high incidence of which is observed during adolescence, is a long-term skin disease. Typical features of the condition include blackheads or whiteheads, papules, pimples, nodules, and cysts. Acne can appear on the back, chest, neck, shoulders, upper arms, and buttocks. Acne not only causes spots and scars but also causes feelings of inferiority and depression. The following four major factors are the cause of acne formation: (1) hyperkeratosis of the skin, (2) overactive oil glands, (3) bacterial infection (

Depending on the cause of acne, its clinical treatment involves the following: (1) Use of vitamin A acid (tretionin), salicylic acid, and azelaic acid to abnormal keratinized hair follicle sebocytes; (2) use of hormonal therapy to reduce sebaceous gland activity and oil secretion; (3) use of antibiotics such as clindamycin, erythromycin, and tetracycline to inhibit pathogenic bacteria in hair follicles, and (4) use of NSAIDs to reduce inflammatory responses [

Therefore, discovery of a drug that has multiple therapeutic effects, which does not result in skin irritation, is important for the treatment of acne [
