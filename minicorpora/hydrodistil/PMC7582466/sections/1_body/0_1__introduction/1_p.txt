0: Acne, a high incidence of which is observed during adolescence, is a long-term skin disease.
1: Typical features of the condition include blackheads or whiteheads, papules, pimples, nodules, and cysts.
2: Acne can appear on the back, chest, neck, shoulders, upper arms, and buttocks.
3: Acne not only causes spots and scars but also causes feelings of inferiority and depression.
4: The following four major factors are the cause of acne formation: (1) hyperkeratosis of the skin, (2) overactive oil glands, (3) bacterial infection ( Cutibacterium acnes ( previously Propionibacterium acnes) and  Staphylococcus aureus), and (4) skin inflammation [ 1].
5: Depending on the cause of acne, its clinical treatment involves the following: (1) Use of vitamin A acid (tretionin), salicylic acid, and azelaic acid to abnormal keratinized hair follicle sebocytes; (2) use of hormonal therapy to reduce sebaceous gland activity and oil secretion; (3) use of antibiotics such as clindamycin, erythromycin, and tetracycline to inhibit pathogenic bacteria in hair follicles, and (4) use of NSAIDs to reduce inflammatory responses [ 2].
6: However, different therapeutic agents result in skin depigmentation, irritation, and desquamation.
7: Therefore, discovery of a drug that has multiple therapeutic effects, which does not result in skin irritation, is important for the treatment of acne [ 3].
