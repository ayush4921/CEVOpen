<p>Nutmeg (
 <italic>Myristica fragrans</italic>) is a condiment that is well known for the flavor it adds to food. Additionally, it is a famous traditional Chinese medicine. 
 <italic>M. fragrans</italic> (MF) is widely cultivated in Asia, including Indonesia, Thailand, Japan, and China. Traditional functions of MF include its use as a remedy for headaches, fever, astringent bowel and as an antidiarrheal compound. MF has many biological activities, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, anti-carcinogenic, and radio-protective activities [

 <italic>p</italic>-cymene, limonene, myrcene, phellandrene, pinene, sabinene, and terpinene), oxygenated terpenes (geraniol, linalool, and terpineol), and aromatic ethers (myristicin, elemicin, safrole, eugenol, and eugenol derivatives) [

Myristicin exhibits various pharmacological activities, such as anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antiproliferative activities. However, safrole and myristicin, the food-borne alkenyl-benzene structures, pose potential risks to human health as they have been found to induce rodent liver tumors at high doses. This occurrence may be due to 1-hydroxymetabolites, which are converted to carcinogenic 1-sulfoxymetabolites by sulfotransferases (SULTs) [

Safrole or 1-hydroxysafrole has been revealed as a carcinogen via the co-administration of the SULT inhibitor pentachlorophenol (PCP) in mice, which resulted in a reduction of hepatic tumor formation upon long-term dietary administration. Therefore, it is recognized as a weak carcinogen by the US government [

Several studies have reported that a high content of myristicin is poisonous and results in hallucinatory side effects owing to the two metabolites of myristicin, 5-allyl-1-methoxy-2,3-dihydroxybenzene and 1-hydroxymyristicin. These metabolites were produced in rat liver microsomes and could be identified in rat urine [
