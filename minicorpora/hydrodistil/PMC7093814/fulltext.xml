Among the <italic>Aquilaria</italic> spp., <italic>A. malaccensis</italic> is the primary producer and is mainly found in Indonesia and Malaysia. In normal condition, agarwood is naturally formed in <italic>Aquilaria</italic> trees as a defense mechanism upon physical damage or microbial infection on the trees, which is a slow process that occurs over several years. The high demand in agarwood has spurred the development of various artificial inoculation methods where agarwood formation is synthetically induced in a shorter period of time. However, the synthetic induction method produces agarwood with aromas different from the naturally formed agarwood. To understand the changes in the agarwoods produced from different induction conditions, metabolite profiling of agarwood essential oil from <italic>A. malaccensis</italic> has been performed. The essential oils of healthy undamaged tree trunks and, naturally formed and synthetically induced agarwoods were obtained using hydrodistillation (HS) method and analysed using gas chromatography mass spectrometer (GC-MS). These data will provide valuable resources for chemical components of agarwood produced by the species in the genus <italic>Aquilaria</italic>.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd><italic>Aquilaria malaccensis</italic></kwd><kwd>Agarwood</kwd><kwd>Hydrodistillation</kwd><kwd>Gas chromatography mass spectrometer</kwd><kwd>Metabolomics</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p id="p0010"><table-wrap position="float" id="undtbl1"><caption><p>Specifications table</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td>Subject area</td><td>Biology</td></tr><tr><td>More specific subject area</td><td>Metabolomics</td></tr><tr><td>Type of data</td><td>Raw data and Excel Table</td></tr><tr><td>How data was acquired</td><td>Metabolomics data were obtained using Perkin Elmer Clarus 600 GC-MS with autosampler</td></tr><tr><td>Data format</td><td>Normalised dataset is tabulated in MS excel (.xlsl format)</td></tr><tr><td>Experimental factors</td><td>Samples were obtained from healthy, undamaged <italic>A. malaccensis</italic> tree as the control.

Compound identification was performed by comparing the ratios of mass-to-charge with a standard mass of NIST Mass Spectral 2008 library. Putative metabolites were assigned to peaks having similarity index of more than 70%. Peak alignment and peak area were obtained using Metabolomics Ion-based Data Extraction Algorithm, version 1.2.0 (MET-IDEA) software [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. A dataset comprising compound name, retention time (RT), fragments <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> and the associated peak areas was obtained. Data normalisation was carried out using MetaboAnalyst 4.0 [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Briefly, peak area was normalised to the internal standard, nanodecanoic acid, followed by log transformation and subjected to data scaling using auto scaling. One way analysis of variance (ANOVA) (SPSS version 22) was used to calculate statistical significance for each metabolite.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Wong</surname><given-names>Y.F.</given-names></name><name><surname>Chin</surname><given-names>S.T.</given-names></name><name><surname>Perlmutter</surname><given-names>P.</given-names></name><name><surname>Marriott</surname><given-names>P.J.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Evaluation of comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography with accurate mass time-of-flight mass spectrometry for the metabolic profiling of plant-fungus interaction in <italic>Aquilaria malaccensis</italic></article-title><source>J.&#x000a0;Chromatogr.
