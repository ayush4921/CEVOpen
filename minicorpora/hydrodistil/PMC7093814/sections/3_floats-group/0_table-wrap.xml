    <td>Samples were obtained from healthy, undamaged 
     <italic>A. malaccensis</italic> tree as the control. The trees containing the agarwood resins were those that have been induced through natural conditions and synthetic method. Naturally formed agarwood was obtained from broken and damaged tree trunk caused by natural phenomenon such as lightning, strong wind and insects gnawing on the tree trunk, and had eventually become rotten. Synthetically induced agarwood was produced by boring holes in the tree trunk using nails and filling the holes with an inoculation mixture that contained honey. The agarwood resin which was formed after five years was used in this study as the synthetically induced agarwood sample.
