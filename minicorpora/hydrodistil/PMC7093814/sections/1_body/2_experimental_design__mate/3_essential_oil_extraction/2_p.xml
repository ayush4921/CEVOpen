<p id="p0040">The essential oils for the non-resinous sample from the healthy tree and the resinous samples from the naturally formed and synthetically induced agarwoods were extracted using hydrodistillation (HS) method, following the method described with modification [
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Ground agarwood (200 g) was soaked in distilled water (1 L) overnight and subsequently placed in a round-bottomed flask (2 L), with water volume adjusted to 1.5 L. For cooling purposes, the flask was connected to a clevenger type apparatus with tap water running. The sample was distilled for 5 h. The essential oil obtained was collected, separated using n-hexane and dried in vacuum rotary evaporator at 45 °C. The essential oil was placed in amber bottles and kept in −20 °C until further analysis. An internal standard, nanodecanoic acid, was added into the sample prior to GC-MS analysis.
