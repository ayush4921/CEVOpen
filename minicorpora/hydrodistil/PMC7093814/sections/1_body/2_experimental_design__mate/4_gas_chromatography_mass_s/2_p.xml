<p id="p0045">All agarwood essential oils (in nine replicates each) were analysed on a PerkinElmer Clarus 600 GC-MS with total run time of 38.5 min (carrier gas helium, 1 mL/min, injection: split 20:1, 3 μL, injector and detector temperature of 200 °C and 300 °C respectively; oven temperature program: 60 °C for 3 min, 10 °C/min to 150 °C, held for 5 min, 10 °C/min to 285 °C, held for 8 min). The chromatographic separation was conducted using a PerkinElmer Elite 5MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm ID x 0.25 μm, film thickness). Full scan mass spectra with mass range set from

 <italic>z</italic> 30 to 300 were obtained. Analysis of a series of 
 <italic>n</italic>-alkanes standard solution (C8–C40) using the same GC-MS parameter was done to calculate the retention index (RI). All samples were injected continuously as one batch in random order.
