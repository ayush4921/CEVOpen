<p id="p0030">The data presented here is a table showing the metabolite profiling analysis of agarwood essential oil obtained using GC-MS. The metabolite profiles were obtained from healthy tree trunk as control, and naturally formed and synthetically induced agarwoods. The dataset was tabulated in MS Excel (xlsx format) comprising compound name, retention time (RT), retention index (RI), molecular formula, molecular weight, fragments ion (

 <italic>z</italic>), significance value and normalised peak area. The data enhanced existing metabolite datasets for naturally formed and synthetically induced 
 <italic>A. malaccensis</italic> agarwood which were obtained using two-dimensional GC coupled to accurate mass time-of-flight mass spectrometer (GCXGC-TOFMS) [
