 <p>Agarwood is the highly valuable fragrant resin of the wounded 
  <italic>Aquilaria</italic> spp. trees widely used in fragrances, medicines and incenses. Among the 
  <italic>Aquilaria</italic> spp., 
  <italic>A. malaccensis</italic> is the primary producer and is mainly found in Indonesia and Malaysia. In normal condition, agarwood is naturally formed in 
  <italic>Aquilaria</italic> trees as a defense mechanism upon physical damage or microbial infection on the trees, which is a slow process that occurs over several years. The high demand in agarwood has spurred the development of various artificial inoculation methods where agarwood formation is synthetically induced in a shorter period of time. However, the synthetic induction method produces agarwood with aromas different from the naturally formed agarwood. To understand the changes in the agarwoods produced from different induction conditions, metabolite profiling of agarwood essential oil from 
  <italic>A. malaccensis</italic> has been performed. The essential oils of healthy undamaged tree trunks and, naturally formed and synthetically induced agarwoods were obtained using hydrodistillation (HS) method and analysed using gas chromatography mass spectrometer (GC-MS). These data will provide valuable resources for chemical components of agarwood produced by the species in the genus 
  <italic>Aquilaria</italic>.
