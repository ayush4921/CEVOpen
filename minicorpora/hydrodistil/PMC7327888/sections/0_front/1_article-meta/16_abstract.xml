 <p>In the study, antifungal and ochratoxin A (OTA) production inhibitory activities of essential oils (EOs) of 
  <italic>Cinnamomum zeylanicum</italic>, 
  <italic>Curcuma longa</italic>, 
  <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic>, 
  <italic>Zingiber officinale</italic>, and 
  <italic>Cymbopogon martini</italic> were reported on 
  <italic>Aspergillus ochraceus and Penicillium verrucosum</italic>. EOs were obtained by hydrodistillation and GC–MS technique was chosen to deduce their chemical profile. Major chemical compounds in EOs of 
  <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic>, 
  <italic>C. longa, O. basilicum, Z. officinale,</italic> and 
  <italic>C. martini</italic> were (E)-cinnamaldehyde (35.81 %), ar-turmerone (46.13 %), eugenol (36.58 %), geranyl proprionate (18.93 %), and geranyl acetate (14.88 %), respectively. The EOs shown potent antioxidant activity by DPPH and ABTS assays. The EOs presented superlative antifungal activity against 
  <italic>P. verrucosum</italic> related to 
  <italic>A. ochraceus</italic>. The 
  <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic> and 
  <italic>C. martini</italic> EOs shown superlative antifungal activity related to other EOs. The 
  <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic> and C. 
  <italic>martini</italic> EOs completely inhibited the growth and OTA production of 
  <italic>P. verrucosum</italic> and 
  <italic>A. ochraceous</italic> at 1500 and 2500 μg/g in maize grains, respectively.
