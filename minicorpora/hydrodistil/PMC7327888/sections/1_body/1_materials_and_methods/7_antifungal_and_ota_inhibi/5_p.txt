0: Prior to OTA determination in test samples, stock solution of OTA standard (98 % HPLC pure, Sigma-Aldrich, Bengaluru, India) was made in acetonitrile (1 mg/mL) and following lower OTA concentrated dilutions were made in HPLC evaluation water (Merck Millipore Pvt Ltd, Bengaluru, India).
1: The LOD (limit of detection) and LOQ (limit of quantification) for OTA was estimated.
2: The LOD was determined as the threefold the signal of the blank and LOQ was determined as three folds of LOD and it was determined as 21 ng/mL and 84 ng/mL, respectively.
3: Curve of calibration for OTA was constructed with different concentration of OTA and peak area.
4: The linearity of calibration curve was judged from regression coefficient (R 2) and noticed as 0.9891.
5: The recovery of the technique was noticed as 92.31 % and found as satisfactory.
