<p id="par0100">Antifungal and OTA inhibitory activities of EOs on 
 <italic>A. ochraceus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. verrucosum</italic> in maize grains were studied as per methodology of Velluti et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. From local agriculture market, fresh and dried maize grains were collected and decontaminated by autoclave and subjected to drying in hot air oven under sterile conditions at 60 ℃. The oven, incubation chamber, and premises were thoroughly fumigated and maintained strict aseptic conditions. The water activity of thoroughly dried maize grains was determined as 0.70. Following, different concentration of EOs (up to 3500 μg/g) containing 0.001 % of Tween 80 and 10 μL of fungal spores (1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> per mL) of 
 <italic>A. ochraceus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. verrucosum</italic> were distinctly treated to 100 g of maize in 500 mL of Erlenmeyer flask (Borosil, India) and vigorously shaken to distribute homogeneously and incubated for 14 days at 28 ℃. Maize samples distinctively inoculated with spores of 
 <italic>A. ochraceus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. verrucosum</italic> were considered as control in their respective study.
