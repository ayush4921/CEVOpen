0: Antifungal and OTA inhibitory activities of EOs on  A. ochraceus and  P. verrucosum in maize grains were studied as per methodology of Velluti et al.
1: [ 39].
2: From local agriculture market, fresh and dried maize grains were collected and decontaminated by autoclave and subjected to drying in hot air oven under sterile conditions at 60 C. The oven, incubation chamber, and premises were thoroughly fumigated and maintained strict aseptic conditions.
3: The water activity of thoroughly dried maize grains was determined as 0.70.
4: Following, different concentration of EOs (up to 3500 g/g) containing 0.001 % of Tween 80 and 10 L of fungal spores (1  10 6 per mL) of  A. ochraceus and  P. verrucosum were distinctly treated to 100 g of maize in 500 mL of Erlenmeyer flask (Borosil, India) and vigorously shaken to distribute homogeneously and incubated for 14 days at 28 C. Maize samples distinctively inoculated with spores of  A. ochraceus and  P. verrucosum were considered as control in their respective study.
