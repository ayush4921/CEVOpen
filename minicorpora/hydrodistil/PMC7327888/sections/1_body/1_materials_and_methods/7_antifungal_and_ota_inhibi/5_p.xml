<p id="par0115">Prior to OTA determination in test samples, stock solution of OTA standard (98 % HPLC pure, Sigma-Aldrich, Bengaluru, India) was made in acetonitrile (1 mg/mL) and following lower OTA concentrated dilutions were made in HPLC evaluation water (Merck Millipore Pvt Ltd, Bengaluru, India). The LOD (limit of detection) and LOQ (limit of quantification) for OTA was estimated. The LOD was determined as the threefold the signal of the blank and LOQ was determined as three folds of LOD and it was determined as 21 ng/mL and 84 ng/mL, respectively. Curve of calibration for OTA was constructed with different concentration of OTA and peak area. The linearity of calibration curve was judged from regression coefficient (R
 <sup>2</sup>) and noticed as 0.9891. The recovery of the technique was noticed as 92.31 % and found as satisfactory.
