<p id="par0140">Antifungal activity of EOs on OTA producing fungi (
 <italic>A. ochraceus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. verrucosum</italic>) was tested by micro-well dilution technique. The MIC and MFC values of the EOs were shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl0020" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. The EOs were shown potent antifungal activity on both the tested fungi, but superlative results were noticed on 
 <italic>P. verrucosum</italic> related to 
 <italic>A. ochraceus</italic>. The EOs of 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic> and 
 <italic>C. martini</italic> were shown best antifungal activity in 
 <italic>A. ochraceus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. verrucosum</italic> related to standard antifungal agent nystatin as well as other tested EOs. While, lowest antifungal activity was noticed in EO of 
 <italic>Z. officinale</italic> against 
 <italic>A. ochraceous</italic> and EO of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> against 
 <italic>P. verrucosum</italic>. The study exhibited that tested EOs were potential fungicidal agents and might found their role in food and feed matrices as bio-fungicides. To conclude, antifungal efficacy of EOs was evaluated in in-vitro food source maize grains under laboratory conditions.
