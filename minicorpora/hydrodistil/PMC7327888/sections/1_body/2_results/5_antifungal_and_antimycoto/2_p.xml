<p id="par0145">All EOs were shown potent antifungal and antimycotoxin activities in in-vitro food sample; maize grains and results were shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl0025" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> and 
 <xref rid="tbl0030" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>. Standard calibration curve was constructed with area of peak and different concentration of OTA and used to determine the unknown concentration of OTA in maize grains. Among the tested EOs, 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic> and 
 <italic>C. martini</italic> were shown potent inhibitory action on growth as well mycotoxin production of 
 <italic>A. ochraceous</italic> and 
 <italic>P. verrucosum</italic>. The EOs of 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic> and C. 
 <italic>martini</italic> were completely inhibited the growth and OTA production of 
 <italic>P. verrucosum</italic> and 
 <italic>A. ochraceous</italic> at 1500 and 2500 μg/g, respectively. The best antifungal and OTA inhibitory activities was noticed against 
 <italic>P. verrucosum</italic> related to 
 <italic>A. ochraceous</italic>. These results were well in agreement with the conclusion of micro-well dilution technique. While, EOs of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic>, 
 <italic>O. basilicum</italic>, and 
 <italic>Z. officinale</italic> were exhibited lowest antifungal and OTA inhibitory activities against 
 <italic>A. ochraceous</italic> and it was 3500 μg/g. The EOs of 
 <italic>O. basilicum</italic> and 
 <italic>Z. officinale</italic> were presented lowest antifungal and OTA inhibitory activities against 
 <italic>P. verrucosum</italic> at 3500 μg/g.
