<p id="par0125">In this study essential oils were extracted by hydrodistillation technique and their yield was tabulated in 
 <xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The extracted EOs were subjected to chemical profile assessment by GCâ€“MS analysis. Total chemical composition of 98.80 %, 98.22 %, 94.58 %, 97.19 %, and 96.27 % were identified in 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic>, 
 <italic>C. longa</italic>, 
 <italic>O. basilicum</italic>, 
 <italic>Z. officinale</italic>, and 
 <italic>C. martini</italic> EOs, respectively (
 <xref rid="tbl0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Total of 38, 32, 33, 41, and 42 chemical compounds were identified in EOs of 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic>, 
 <italic>C. longa</italic>, 
 <italic>O. basilicum</italic>, 
 <italic>Z. officinale</italic>, and 
 <italic>C. martini</italic>, respectively. The major chemical compounds in EOs of 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic> were limonene (10.54 %), (E)-cinnamaldehyde (35.81 %), and eugenol (12.41 %), and in 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> were ar-turmerone (46.13 %) and ar-curcumene (8.33 %), and in 
 <italic>O. basilicum</italic> were eugenol (36.58 %) and linalool (10.83 %), and in 
 <italic>Z. officinale</italic> were geraniol isobutanoate (10.41 %), geranyl acetone (11.05 %), geranyl acetate (14.59 %), geranyl proprionate (18.93 %), thymol (10.86 %), and limonene (10.88 %), and in 
 <italic>C. martini</italic> were terpinen-4-ol (11.52 %) and geranyl acetate (14.88 %). The results settled that EOs of 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic>, 
 <italic>C. longa</italic>, 
 <italic>O. basilicum</italic>, 
 <italic>Z. officinale</italic>, and 
 <italic>C. martini</italic> were belonged to the chemotypes of linalool, ar-turmerone, eugenol, geranyl proprionate, and geranyl acetate, respectively.
