<p id="par0130">The functional property of EOs such as antioxidant activity was determined by DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging assays and IC50 results (effective concentration required to inhibit 50 % of free radicals) were shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. Best antioxidant potential in DPPH assay was noticed in EOs of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> and 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic>, and their IC50 values were noticed as 21.56 ± 0.77 μg/mL and 22.14 ± 1.72 μg/mL, respectively. The lowermost antioxidant potential (IC50 value) in DPPH assay was noticed in EO of 
 <italic>Z. officinale</italic> and it was 29.11 ± 1.60 μg/mL. On the other hand, 
 <italic>C. martini</italic> showed best antioxidant potential in ABTS assay, and its IC50 was noticed as 33.47 ± 1.71 μg/mL, and lowermost antioxidant potential was noticed in EO of 
 <italic>O. basilicum</italic> (40.31 ± 1.07 μg/mL).
