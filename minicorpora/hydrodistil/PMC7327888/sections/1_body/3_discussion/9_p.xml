Though, mechanism of action involved in the antifungal and OTA inhibitory activities need to be disclose in detail. However, several studies reported that EOs are volatile and highly unstable to light, temperature, oxygen, pH and other environmental conditions. Therefore, stability and activity of EOs in food matrices need to be enhanced by modern techniques, i.e. nanotechnology [
