<p id="par0175">In the present study, EOs contain variety of terpenes and terpenoids, phenolic and aliphatic antifungal compounds (
 <xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These lipophilic and low molecular weight compounds easily cross through the fungal plasma membrane and disrupts the integrity and permeability of membrane. These volatile compounds of EOs negatively interact with the cellular membrane by countering with enzymes and cellular ions, and cause leakage of ions (Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>, Mg
 <sup>2+</sup>, H
 <sup>+</sup>, and K
 <sup>+</sup>) and osmotic imbalance, thereby depletes the ATP synthesis and activate the apoptotic death. Moreover, EOs depletes the level of ergosterol content in fungal cell membrane and thereby facilitates the easy entry of antimicrobial components through cell membrane [
