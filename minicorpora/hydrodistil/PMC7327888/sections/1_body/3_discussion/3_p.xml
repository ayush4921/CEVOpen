<p id="par0155">In our study, we identified more than 30 different compounds in EOs obtained from bark of 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic>, rhizome of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic>, leaves of 
 <italic>O. basilicum</italic>, rhizome of 
 <italic>Z. officinale</italic>, and leaves of 
 <italic>C. martini.</italic> Most of the identified chemical compounds were in accordance to earlier literature. Pawar et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0205" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] Simić et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0210" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and Ranasinghe et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0215" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] documented that (E)-cinnamaldehyde as major compound and followed by eugenol, linalool, limonene, and benzaldehyde occupy major composition in EO of 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic>. Though, Ranasinghe et al. found that eugenol and cinnamaldehyde as major compound in leaf and bark 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic> EO, respectively [
 <xref rid="bib0215" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In our study, EO of 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic> have (E)-cinnamaldehyde, eugenol, and limonene as major compounds and thus, belong to the aforementioned chemotype. Further, EO of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> belong to the chemotype of α-turmerone, β-turmerone, and ar-turmerone as per past descriptions of Avanço et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0220" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and Kumar et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In our study, EO of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> was found as chemotype of ar-turmerone and well in accord with earlier reports. In case of 
 <italic>O. basilicum</italic> EO, previous reports of Snoussi et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0225" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] de Almeida et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0230" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and Grayer et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0235" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] were determined that EO of 
 <italic>O. basilicum</italic> belong to the chemotype of eugenol and linalool. In accordance to these reports, EO of 
 <italic>O. basilicum</italic> in our study belong to chemotype of eugenol and linalool. Similarly, EO of 
 <italic>Z. officinale</italic> in our study belong to the chemotype of geranyl proprionate, geranyl acetate, thymol, and limonene as per past descriptions of Yamamoto-Ribeiro et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0240" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] and Singh et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0245" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Also, in our study, EO of 
 <italic>C. martini</italic> was found chemotype of geranyl acetate and terpinene-4-ol and found in accord with prior information of Kalagatur et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0250" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], Kakaraparthi et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0255" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and Nirmal et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0260" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. However, quantity of EOs composites was quite wide-ranging in interrelated to that past information. Quantity and quality of chemical composites of EOs depends on the part of the plant used for EO extraction, genome of the plant, nutrient availability and final extraction technique as well [
 <xref rid="bib0255" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0265" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0270" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0275" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0280" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0285" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>]. Therefore, quantity of chemical contents was relatively diverse in our study compared to previous reports.
