<p id="par0160">The EOs are regarded as potential antioxidants, and their applications as natural antioxidants is growing interest in food over synthetic antioxidants owed to toxic effects on human health. The antioxidant potential of EOs highly useful in food products, either by direct mixing or in active packaging and package coatings, thereby represent the safe strategies to avoid autoxidation of food and lengthen the shelf life of food. Consequently, assessment of the antioxidant potential of EOs is most vital in food science [
 <xref rid="bib0290" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Moreover, many researchers determined that EOs normalize the oxidative stress of mycotoxigenic fungi and decline the biosynthesis of mycotoxins [

 <xref rid="bib0295" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0300" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Therefore, in our study, antioxidant potential of EOs was considered and EOs exhibited potent antioxidant potential in scavenging the radicals of DPPH and ABTS. In present study, assortments of potential antioxidants were noticed in EOs (
