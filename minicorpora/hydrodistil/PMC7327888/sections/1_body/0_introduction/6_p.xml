<p id="par0050">Therefore, microbiologists and food technologists have a great concern over minimization of OTA in food and feed matrices. At present, various physical, chemical, and biological methods were available to minimize the mycotoxins in food. The physical methods such as irradiation, high-pressure processing, microwave, and cold plasma were found effective in minimizing the fungal growth and mycotoxin contamination, and nevertheless; these have certain limitations, i.e. high-cost, unsafe, and pre-requisite of skilled expertise [
