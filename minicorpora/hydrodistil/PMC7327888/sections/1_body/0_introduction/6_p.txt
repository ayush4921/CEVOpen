0: Therefore, microbiologists and food technologists have a great concern over minimization of OTA in food and feed matrices.
1: At present, various physical, chemical, and biological methods were available to minimize the mycotoxins in food.
2: The physical methods such as irradiation, high-pressure processing, microwave, and cold plasma were found effective in minimizing the fungal growth and mycotoxin contamination, and nevertheless; these have certain limitations, i.e.
3: high-cost, unsafe, and pre-requisite of skilled expertise [ [19],  [20],  [21],  [22],  [23],  [24]].
4: The chemical treatments such as ammonia, citric acid, salicylic acid, etc.
5: partially degrades mycotoxins and their by-products were found still toxic and usage of these chemicals in food is in no way acceptable [ 25].
