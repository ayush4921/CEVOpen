1: OTA has shown carcinogenic properties in laboratory animals and therefore, International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has categorized into Group 2B, which means possible to cause cancer in humans [ 16].
2: Moreover, OTA has been shown to be fetal nephrotoxic and immunosuppression in laboratory animals and considered as most toxic [ 17].
3: In consequence, some nations and regulatory bodies such as European Union (EU) and Joint Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)/World Health Organization (WHO) Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) have evaluated the risk assessment of OTA and recommended regulatory level to control or prevent OTA contamination.
