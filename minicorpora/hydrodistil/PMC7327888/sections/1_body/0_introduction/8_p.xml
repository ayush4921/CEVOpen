<p id="par0060">In the present study, EOs of 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic>, 
 <italic>C. longa</italic>, 
 <italic>O. basilicum</italic>, 
 <italic>Z. officinale</italic>, and 
 <italic>C. martini</italic> were obtained by hydrodistillation and GCâ€“MS analysis was chosen to deduce their chemical profile. The antioxidant action of EOs was measured by radical scavenging assays. Antifungal activity of EOs on selected fungi 
 <italic>A. ochraceus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. verrucosum</italic> was tested by micro-well dilution technique. Finally, inhibitory activity of EOs on the growth and OTA content of 
 <italic>A. ochraceus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. verrucosum</italic> was established in maize grains.
