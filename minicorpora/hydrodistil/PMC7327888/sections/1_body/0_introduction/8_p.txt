0: In the present study, EOs of  C. zeylanicum,  C. longa,  O. basilicum,  Z. officinale, and  C. martini were obtained by hydrodistillation and GCMS analysis was chosen to deduce their chemical profile.
1: The antioxidant action of EOs was measured by radical scavenging assays.
2: Antifungal activity of EOs on selected fungi  A. ochraceus and  P. verrucosum was tested by micro-well dilution technique.
3: Finally, inhibitory activity of EOs on the growth and OTA content of  A. ochraceus and  P. verrucosum was established in maize grains.
