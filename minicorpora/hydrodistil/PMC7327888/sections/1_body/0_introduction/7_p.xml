<p id="par0055">Captivatingly, researchers revealed that oxidative stress has been extensively involved in the secondary metabolism of fungi. These secondary metabolites can counteract or, on the other hand, augment the harmful effects of oxidative stress, and thus, fungi may well use reactive oxygen species as messengers that induce/modulate the biosynthesis of defensive chemical agents like mycotoxins [
 <xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In this context, usage of antioxidants could overwhelm the oxidative stress and decline the biosynthesis of mycotoxins [
 <xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Further, antioxidant substances with potential antifungal activity could be highly appropriate for minimizing the fungal growth as well as mycotoxin production in food sources [
 <xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Consequently, researchers, consumers, and government are highly opted in usage of natural antioxidants that have potent antifungal activity for minimizing the fungal growth and mycotoxin contamination owed to their non-toxicity and eco-friendly [
