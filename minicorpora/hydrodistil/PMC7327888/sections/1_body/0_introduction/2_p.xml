<p id="par0030">Mycotoxins are poisonous substances and belong to metabolites of fungi and that are naturally produced on food matrices such as cereal products, various fruit juices, vegetables, spices, etc [
 <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. It has been known that almost one-fourth of cereals consumed worldwide are contaminated with mycotoxins and pose serious health risk to human society [
 <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Until the date, about 400 mycotoxins were known, and their number will be raised with advancement of the novel analytical techniques in the forthcoming years [
 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Fungal infestation and mycotoxin production can occur during the pre-harvest and post-harvest seasons, and on/in the food itself often at an opportune environmental milieu [
 <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The mycotoxin occurrence in food matrices principally relies on diversity of fungal strain, fungal vulnerability of the plant in the field, microbial population, moisture content, nutrient composition, temperature, aeration, and stress factors [
 <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Most of the mycotoxins are thermally stable and conventional food-processing techniques with temperatures up to 100 Â°C have little or no effect on detoxification of mycotoxins [
