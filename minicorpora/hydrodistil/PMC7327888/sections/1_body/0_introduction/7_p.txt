0: Captivatingly, researchers revealed that oxidative stress has been extensively involved in the secondary metabolism of fungi.
1: These secondary metabolites can counteract or, on the other hand, augment the harmful effects of oxidative stress, and thus, fungi may well use reactive oxygen species as messengers that induce/modulate the biosynthesis of defensive chemical agents like mycotoxins [ 26].
2: In this context, usage of antioxidants could overwhelm the oxidative stress and decline the biosynthesis of mycotoxins [ 27].
3: Further, antioxidant substances with potential antifungal activity could be highly appropriate for minimizing the fungal growth as well as mycotoxin production in food sources [ 28].
4: Consequently, researchers, consumers, and government are highly opted in usage of natural antioxidants that have potent antifungal activity for minimizing the fungal growth and mycotoxin contamination owed to their non-toxicity and eco-friendly [ [29],  [30],  [31],  [32]].
5: In the scenario, essential oils (EOs) have received great consideration as fungicides and antioxidants for controlling the fungal growth and mycotoxin contamination in food [ 32].
