<p id="par0190">In this study, EOs were extracted from bark of 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic>, rhizome of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic>, leaves of 
 <italic>O. basilicum</italic>, rhizome of 
 <italic>Z. officinale</italic>, and leaves of 
 <italic>C. martini</italic> by hydrodistillation technique. The GCâ€“MS chemical profile settled that EOs of 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic>, 
 <italic>C. longa</italic>, 
 <italic>O. basilicum</italic>, 
 <italic>Z. officinale</italic>, and 
 <italic>C. martini</italic> were belonged to the chemotype of linalool, ar-turmerone, eugenol, geranyl proprionate, and geranyl acetate, respectively. The EOs presented potent antioxidant activity in DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging assays and thereby EOs could find their potential representation in food industry as natural antioxidants. The EOs exhibited potential MIC and MFC values against 
 <italic>P. verrucosum</italic> and 
 <italic>A. ochraceous</italic> in micro-well dilution technique. Further, EOs showed excellent antifungal and OTA inhibitory activities against 
 <italic>P. verrucosum</italic> and 
 <italic>A. ochraceous</italic> in in-vitro food sample, maize grains. The investigation clinched that EOs could be considerably appropriate for keeping safe of food and feed matrices from fungal infestation and mycotoxin contamination, especially during the period of storage.
