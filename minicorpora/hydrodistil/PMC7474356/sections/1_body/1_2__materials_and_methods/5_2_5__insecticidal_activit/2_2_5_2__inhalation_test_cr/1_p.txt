0: The study of the insecticidal activity was evaluated by several preliminary tests in order to choose the concentrations to be used for the evaluation of the insecticidal potential of  Ruta chalepensis essential oil.
1: The volumes used were 20, 40, 60, and 80  l/Petri dish, corresponding, respectively, to the concentrations 0.15; 0.31; 0.46, and 0.62  l/mL of air.
2: Filter papers with a diameter of 4 cm were impregnated separately by the different volumes tested.
3: Subsequently, the paper discs were attached to the lids of Petri dishes.
4: The dishes were then covered after the introduction of 20 nonsexed adult insects (without separation between male and female sex) [ 21] aged between 10 and 14 days [ 15] into each Petri dish.
5: The dishes were placed under the same environmental conditions as those used for insect rearing.
6: The control dishes were prepared in the same way without the addition of essential oil [ 21].
