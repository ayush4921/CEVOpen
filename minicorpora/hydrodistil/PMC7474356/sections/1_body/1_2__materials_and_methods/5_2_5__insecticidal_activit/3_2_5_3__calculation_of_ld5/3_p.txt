0: From the equations of the regression lines, the LD 50 and the LT 50 were calculated by replacing  y by the probit of 50%.
1: The LD 50 and TL50 could also be determined graphically by looking for the abscissa of the point corresponding to probit 5; thus, the LD 50 or TL 50 would be equal to anti-log10 x  l/ml with  x = log10 of the time or of the dose corresponding to probit 5 on the graph [ 23].
2: The results were obtained using GraphPad software (prism5 version 5.03 December 10, 2009) and Log-probit analysis software (WinDL version 2.0) developed by CIRAD-CA/MABIS performed by CIRAD-CA/MABIS.
