0: Indeed, to estimate the LD 50 and the LT 50, the percentages of mortality were transformed in probits and the concentrations and time in decimal logarithm.
1: These transformations have allowed us to establish equations for regression lines probit-logarithm of type: (4)y=ax+b,where  y is the corrected mortality probits,  x is the logarithm of the dose or time, and  a is the slope.
