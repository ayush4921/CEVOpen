<p>From the equations of the regression lines, the LD
 <sub>50</sub> and the LT
 <sub>50</sub> were calculated by replacing 
 <italic>y</italic> by the probit of 50%. The LD
 <sub>50</sub> and TL50 could also be determined graphically by looking for the abscissa of the point corresponding to probit 5; thus, the LD
 <sub>50</sub> or TL
 <sub>50</sub> would be equal to anti-log10
 <italic>x</italic> 
 <italic>μ</italic>l/ml with 
 <italic>x</italic> = log10 of the time or of the dose corresponding to probit 5 on the graph [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The results were obtained using GraphPad software (prism5 version 5.03 December 10, 2009) and Log-probit analysis software (WinDL version 2.0) developed by CIRAD-CA/MABIS performed by CIRAD-CA/MABIS.
