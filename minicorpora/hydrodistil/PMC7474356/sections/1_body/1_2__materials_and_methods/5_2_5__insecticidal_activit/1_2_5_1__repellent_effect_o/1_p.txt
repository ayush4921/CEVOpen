0: The repellent effect of the essential oil of  R.  chalepensis L. on adults of  Tribolium castaneum Herbst was evaluated using the preferential area method on filter paper described by McDonald's [ 20], under the same conditions as those used for mass rearing (a temperature of 30C and relative humidity of 70%).
1: As experimental containers, Petri dishes (9 cm in diameter) were used to confine the adult  Tribolium castaneum.
2: Filter paper discs (9 cm diameter) were divided into two equal parts.
3: The three tested volumes of essential oil (3, 4, and 5  l) corresponding, respectively, to three concentrations (0.023, 0.031, and 0.038  l/ml) were deposited separately on one-half of the disc using a micropipette, as uniformly as possible.
4: The concentration was calculated by relating the volume of the essential oil to the volume of the Petri dish (a 10.5   1.5 cm dish provides 129.89 ml of air).
5: The other half of the filter paper (control) received distilled water with the same volumes used for the essential oil.
6: After air drying, each disc containing one part treated with the essential oil and the other with distilled water was carefully fixed to the bottom of a Petri dish.
7: Ten nonsexed adult insects (with no separation between male and female sex) were released in the center of the filter paper disc and the Petri dish was then covered with a lid.
