<p>The repellent effect of the essential oil of

 <italic>chalepensis</italic> L. on adults of 
 <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> Herbst was evaluated using the preferential area method on filter paper described by McDonald's [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], under the same conditions as those used for mass rearing (a temperature of 30°C and relative humidity of 70%). As experimental containers, Petri dishes (9 cm in diameter) were used to confine the adult 
 <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic>. Filter paper discs (9 cm diameter) were divided into two equal parts. The three tested volumes of essential oil (3, 4, and 5 
 <italic>μ</italic>l) corresponding, respectively, to three concentrations (0.023, 0.031, and 0.038 
 <italic>μ</italic>l/ml) were deposited separately on one-half of the disc using a micropipette, as uniformly as possible. The concentration was calculated by relating the volume of the essential oil to the volume of the Petri dish (a 10.5 
 <italic>∗</italic> 1.5 cm dish provides 129.89 ml of air). The other half of the filter paper (control) received distilled water with the same volumes used for the essential oil. After air drying, each disc containing one part treated with the essential oil and the other with distilled water was carefully fixed to the bottom of a Petri dish. Ten nonsexed adult insects (with no separation between male and female sex) were released in the center of the filter paper disc and the Petri dish was then covered with a lid.
