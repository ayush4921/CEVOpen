<p>The essential oil was extracted from aerial parts of 
 <italic>Ruta chalepensis</italic> L. by hydrodistillation using a Clevenger-type device. Distillation was carried out by boiling, for 3 h, 100 g of fresh plant material with 1000 ml of water in a 1-liter flask surmounted by a 60 cm long graduated column connected to a condenser [

The vapor loaded with essential oils, passing through the refrigerant, condenses and falls in the graduated burette, thus allowing the volume collected to be read directly. Water and oil separate by a difference in density; indeed, the condensed vapor produces two phases: an organic phase containing the essential oil and an aqueous phase (aromatic hydrosol) which contains a nonnegligible quantity of oil either in solubilized form or in the form of finely dispersed droplets [
