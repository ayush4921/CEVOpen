<p>The identification of 
 <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> Herbst was based on several morphological criteria. Our starting point was insects larger than 1 mm and not moths; insects with antennae but without distinct caudal appendages were selected for the next stages of identification. At this stage, insects with a size less than 10 mm, a head not extended by a rostrum, and straight antennae without distinct elbows were selected. Next, insects with a head that is clearly visible in dorsal view and with lateral edges of the pronotum that are not toothed were retained. Then, we selected the insects which have antennae terminated by more or less distinct clubs and which are deprived of tubercles at the level of the anterior angles of the pronotum. To avoid confusion between 
 <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> and 
 <italic>Tribolium confusum</italic>, the antennal clubs and the space between the eyes were examined. Retained insects have an antennal club abruptly enlarged and a narrow space between the eyes [
