0: The identification of  Tribolium castaneum Herbst was based on several morphological criteria.
1: Our starting point was insects larger than 1 mm and not moths; insects with antennae but without distinct caudal appendages were selected for the next stages of identification.
2: At this stage, insects with a size less than 10 mm, a head not extended by a rostrum, and straight antennae without distinct elbows were selected.
3: Next, insects with a head that is clearly visible in dorsal view and with lateral edges of the pronotum that are not toothed were retained.
4: Then, we selected the insects which have antennae terminated by more or less distinct clubs and which are deprived of tubercles at the level of the anterior angles of the pronotum.
5: To avoid confusion between  Tribolium castaneum and  Tribolium confusum, the antennal clubs and the space between the eyes were examined.
6: Retained insects have an antennal club abruptly enlarged and a narrow space between the eyes [ 10 12].
