0: After identification, we established an initial population of  Tribolium castaneum for mass rearing.
1: Adult individuals were placed in 1-liter glass jars containing 100 g of the soft wheat which was crushed since  Tribolium castaneum is a secondary granivorous insect that feeds, both in the adult stage and in the larval stage, mainly on broken wheat [ 13].
2: These jars were placed in an incubator set at a temperature of 30C  1C and relative humidity of 70%  5% [ 14].
3: In order to avoid the overcrowding phenomenon, adults were regularly transferred to new jars, thus ensuring new infestations.
4: For all tests, adults aged 1014 days were used [ 15].
