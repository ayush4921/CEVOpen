0: Then, we penetrated right into this formation in order to avoid the margins (usually degraded) and the boundaries between two neighboring formations which are often heterogeneous; once in an apparently floristically homogeneous surface SAFH, we make transection in the four directions, following ropes of 5 meters each.
1: While moving along each rope, the  Ruta plants encountered were collected and placed in a bag bearing the number and direction of the transect in question.
2: This operation was repeated at five points, chosen at random from the SAFH.
