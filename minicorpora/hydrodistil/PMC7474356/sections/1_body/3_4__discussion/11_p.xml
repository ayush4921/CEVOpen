<p>Thus, given the molecular diversity of the essential oil of 
 <italic>Ruta chalepensis</italic> L. (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), it seems more likely that its insecticidal activity results from the association of several mechanisms which are exerted jointly on different target parts of 
 <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic>. In addition, the rapid action of essential oils on harmful insects is due to a neurotoxic effect; indeed, essential oils can penetrate through the cuticle and come into contact with the nerve endings of the trachea of the insect and then cause neurotoxic activity and rapid death [
