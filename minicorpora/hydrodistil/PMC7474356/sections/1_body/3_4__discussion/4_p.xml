<p>It would seem that the insect repellency of the essential oil of 
 <italic>Ruta chalepensis</italic> is due to its major compound, 2-undecanone (64.35%). Indeed, in 2007, in the United States of America, the Environmental Protection Agency approved the repellant BioUD®, in which the active compound is 2-undecanone (7.75%) isolated from wild tomatoes (
 <italic>Lycopersicon hirsutum</italic> Dunal f. 
 <italic>glabratum</italic> C. H. Müll). BioUD® was more effective against mosquitos (
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> L. and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> Skuse) and the American dog tick (
 <italic>Dermacentor variabilis</italic> Say.) than the commercial repellant DEET (N, N diethyl-m-toluamide), mostly used against arthropods [
