<p>The essential oil yield of 
 <italic>R. chalepensis</italic> from Oulmes (2.72%) was higher than that obtained by the same species collected from other regions, either in Morocco (1%) [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] or in central Tunisia (0.87%) [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] or that growing in the wild in Algeria (0.9%) [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The main compounds of the essential oil studied were 2-undecanone (64.35%), piperonyl piperazine (11.9%), 2-decanaone (5.12%), 2-dodecanone (4.52%), decipidone (3.9%), and 2-tridecanone (2.36%). The comparison of the results obtained with those of other studies on the same species but with different origins shows a difference in composition, more quantitatively than qualitatively. Indeed, for 
 <italic>Ruta chalepensis</italic> L. growing in the wild in Tunisia, three main constituents have been reported: 2-undecanone (25.94%), 5-dodecanone acetate (9.35%), and 2-decanone (2.42%) [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Similarly, the work undertaken by [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] has shown that the essential oil of 
 <italic>Ruta chalepensis</italic> collected from the north of Tunisia contains 2-undecanone (77.18%), 2-decanone (8.96%), and 2-dodecanone (2.37%) as major constituents. Furthermore, the major constituents of the Palestinian 
 <italic>Ruta chalepensis</italic> essential oil were linalyl acetate (34.21%), 
 <italic>Î²</italic>-linalool (31.78%), and 2-nonanone (8.15%) [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. These differences observed in the chemical composition of 
 <italic>Ruta chalepensis</italic> L. essential oil from different regions can be explained by several factors, particularly edaphic and climatic ones. The chemical profile of the essential oil is also influenced by the harvest period and stage and depends on the extraction and analysis techniques used [
