<p>The neurotoxic modes of action on insects are mainly linked to the enzymatic activity of acetylcholinesterase [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. For their part, studies carried out on the effects of the essential oil of 
 <italic>Ruta chalepensis</italic> L. on the species of the genus 
 <italic>Tribolium</italic> such as 
 <italic>Tribolium confusum</italic> have shown that it induces glutathione S-transferases and reduces the activity of the acetylcholinesterase [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The glutathione S-transferases are involved in insecticide resistance [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and play a role in the metabolism of organophosphorus and organochlorine compounds [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The reduction of the acetylcholinesterase by many neurotoxicants causes the accumulation of acetylcholine in the synaptic space which maintains a permanent transmission of nerve impulses; the action of the essential oil of 
 <italic>Ruta chalepensis</italic> L. is manifested by convulsions, lack of coordination of movements and tremors [
