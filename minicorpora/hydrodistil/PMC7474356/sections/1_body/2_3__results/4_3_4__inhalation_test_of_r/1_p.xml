 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> illustrates the evolution of the corrected mortality rates of adults of 
 <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> as a function of time and of the concentration of the 
 <italic>Ruta chalepensis</italic> L. essential oil. It appears that the plant studied has a significant insecticide power as even at low concentrations of 0.15 
 <italic>μ</italic>l/ml, the percentage of mortality reached 55.56% after 48 hours of incubation. Furthermore, this period decreased when the dose used was increased; thus, for a dose of 0.31 
 <italic>μ</italic>l/ml, the mortality reached 57.90% after 24 hours.
