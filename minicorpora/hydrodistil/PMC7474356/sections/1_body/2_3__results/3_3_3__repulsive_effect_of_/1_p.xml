<p>The repulsion percentages obtained with some adults of 
 <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> after one hour of their exposure to different doses of the 
 <italic>Ruta chalepensis</italic> L. essential oil are summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; it appears that the dose of 0.038 
 <italic>μ</italic>l/ml represents a significant repellency (100%) after 15 min; the 0.031 
 <italic>μ</italic>l/ml dose caused repulsion of all adults after 20 min of exposure while the dose of 0.023 
 <italic>μ</italic>l/ml had no repulsive effect until 10 min of exposure and 100% of repulsion was reached after 25 min
