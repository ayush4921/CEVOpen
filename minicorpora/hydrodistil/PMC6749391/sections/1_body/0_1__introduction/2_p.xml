 <italic>P. eldarica</italic> has been used for the treatment of asthma [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-24-03203" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]; moreover, it is useful in treating eczema and other skin wounds and irritations [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-24-03203" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In previous studies, it has been shown that the EO from the bark of 
 <italic>P. eldarica</italic> contains polyphenolic compounds, such as taxifolin and catechin, which have a wide range of pharmacological activities [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-24-03203" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Owing to the important therapeutic applications of 
 <italic>P. eldarica</italic> in traditional medicine, the composition of the EOs from the needles, fruits, and bark of 
 <italic>P. eldarica</italic> grown in Isfahan and Iran has been investigated [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-24-03203" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-24-03203" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. It was found that D-germacrene, β–caryophyllene, α-pinene, and longifolene were the main components of the EOs of the needles, fruits, and bark of 
 <italic>P. eldarica</italic>, respectively. The composition of resins and needle EOs from 
 <italic>P. sylvestris</italic>, which is native to Europe and Asia, has also been assessed in previous studies [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-24-03203" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-24-03203" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The main constituents were δ-3-carene, α-pinene, δ-cadinene, β-pinene, and camphene. The biological activities of the essential EOs of pines have been reported in different parts of the world [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-24-03203" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The main components of pine extracts, such as α-pinene and β-pinene, have displayed a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activities [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-24-03203" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-24-03203" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that pine extracts also have potential antifungal properties [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-24-03203" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
