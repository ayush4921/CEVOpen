<p>Recently, the antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens are increasing and resulting in a reduction in the efficiency of clinical treatments. 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> have a high ability to become resistant to antibiotics. Latest reports of vancomycin-resistant 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> have shown that effective antibiotics against the organism may not be readily available for a long time [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-24-03203" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. It was demonstrated that 71.6% of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> strains isolated from children’s stool and water samples in South Africa were multi-antibiotic resistant [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-24-03203" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Several studies have focused on natural plant products with potent anticancer, antibacterial, antifungal, and antioxidant effects, and the efficacy of EOs have been emphasized [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-24-03203" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-24-03203" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-24-03203" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. According to our study, the EOs of 
 <italic>P. eldarica</italic> contain monoterpene hydrocarbons, sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, and oxygenated hydrocarbons. In this study, the antibacterial and antifungal properties of the EOs of 
 <italic>P. eldarica</italic> were examined. The results of the antimicrobial assay are presented in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-03203-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. Both needle and bark EOs displayed antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (ATCC 29213) and pollen EO exhibited a bactericidal effect against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (ATCC 25922). 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> (ATCC 10231) was most sensitive to the bark EO, with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 125 µg/mL. These EOs of 
 <italic>P. eldarica</italic> contain major compounds, such as α-pinene, germacrene, caryophyllene, and limonene, which have been reported to display antimicrobial activity against important pathogens. Rivas da Silva et al. [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-24-03203" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] tested the biological activities of α-pinene and β-pinene enantiomers against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, 
 <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> T
 <sub>1</sub>-444 Serotype A, 
 <italic>Rhizopus oryzae</italic> UCP1506, and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> using the MIC and the minimal microbicidal concentration (MMC). They reported that the (+)-enantiomers showed high antifungal activity and that the synergistic effects of these compounds combined with microbicides reduced the MIC of the combined materials [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-24-03203" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In the similar study performed by Scalas et al. [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-24-03203" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], the EO of 
 <italic>P. sylvestris</italic> and α-pinene displayed good inhibitory activities against 
 <italic>C. neoformans</italic>. In addition, combination of itraconazole with the EO of 
 <italic>P. sylvestris</italic> showed a good synergistic action against 
 <italic>C. neoformans</italic>. The EO of 
 <italic>Liquidambar styraciflua</italic> leaf, which includes α-pinene as its major compound, also showed a good synergistic effect with tetracycline and ciprofloxacin against 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (ATCC 6633) [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-24-03203" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In the present study, EO of pollen was rich in α-pinene (25.64%) and exhibited moderate antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> with MIC level of 225 μg/mL. Recently, one study reported the moderate antifungal activity of 
 <italic>Thimus algeriensis</italic> EO against 
 <italic>C. glabrata</italic> (ATCC22553) and 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> and a total of 29 compounds were identified in the EO of 
 <italic>T. algeriensis</italic>, with α-terpinyl acetate (47.4%), neryl acetate (9.6%), and α-pinene (6.8%) as the major compounds [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-24-03203" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Moreover, the antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic>Juniperus oxycedrus</italic> EO was found against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> subs. 
 <italic>aureus</italic> (CCM 4223) and predominant constituent of 
 <italic>J. oxycedrus</italic> EO was also identified as α-pinene [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-24-03203" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In a study of the antifungal activity of 
 <italic>P. pinaster</italic> bark, its ethanolic extract displayed high antifungal activity against 
 <italic>Trametes versicolor</italic> and moderate antifungal activity against 
 <italic>Coniophera puteana</italic> [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-24-03203" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. It was shown that limonene has antibacterial activities against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (gram-positive), 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (gram-negative), and the yeast, 
 <italic>C. neoformans</italic> [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-24-03203" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The antibacterial activities of 
 <italic>P. elliottii</italic> resin-oil against multidrug-resistant strains were evaluated using the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) method. The MIC varied between 25 and 100 µg/mL, and the drug-resistant mutant of 
 <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> was more sensitive to the oils [
