<p>The main constituents of the needle EO were the sesquiterpene hydrocarbons D-germacrene (18.17%) and caryophyllene (15.42%) and the monoterpene hydrocarbons β-pinene (10.62%) and γ-terpinene (12.96%). The most abundant compound, 
 <sc>d</sc>-germacrene, has been known to exert cytotoxic activity against cancer cell lines, fungicidal activity, and antibacterial properties against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria [

 <sc>d</sc>-germacrene and β-caryophyllene [
