<p>Among the monoterpene hydrocarbons that were found in needle EO, γ-terpinene (12.96%) and β-pinene (10.62%) were the most abundant. It has been reported that γ-terpinene possesses potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity. Treatment with γ-terpinene has been shown to reduce inflammatory parameters, such as edema and cytokine production [

 <xref rid="B19-molecules-24-03203" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. It can hence be concluded that γ-terpinene has not been found in high amounts in other pines in previous studies. According to previous studies, even EOs from plants of the same species can differ in their composition according to the geographical location and age of the plant [
