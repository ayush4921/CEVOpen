<p>In the present study, in the pollen EO, α-pinene (25.64%) and limonene (19.94%) were the most abundant compounds (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-03203-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Pharmacological studies have suggested that low exposure to α-pinene leads to anti-inflammatory activity via the suppression of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-24-03203" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. It has also been shown that α-pinene has potential anti-osteoarthritic [

 <xref rid="B25-molecules-24-03203" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. According to the results of the analysis of the bark EO, there was a high proportion of the monoterpene hydrocarbon limonene (16.99%); moreover, oxygenated sesquiterpenes, such as caryophyllene oxide (13.22%) and drimenol (13.2%), were the next most abundant components. Limonene has been reported to possess potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties [

 <xref rid="B27-molecules-24-03203" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Caryophyllene oxide, an oxygenated terpenoid has been shown to exert significant antifungal [

 <xref rid="B29-molecules-24-03203" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In a previous study of the bark of 
 <italic>P. eldarica</italic> from Isfahan and Iran, α-pinene and caryophyllene oxide were the main constituents of the EO [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-24-03203" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This result differed from that of the current study, possibly due to difference in the area the studied pines were grown. A classification of the samples based on structure type of EOs obtained from different aerial parts of 
 <italic>P. eldarica</italic> is summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-03203-f002">Figure 2</xref>. A large number of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (49.25%), monoterpene hydrocarbons (37.57%), and oxygenated sesquiterpenes (5.05%) were detected in the needle EO in this study, whereas the content of diterpenoids was significantly lower (0.23%). The pollen and bark EO had a large abundance of monoterpene hydrocarbons (61.44% and 32.91%, respectively). Considering all these data together has shown that there is quantitative variation between species and between different aerial parts of 
 <italic>Pinus</italic>. This information could be valuable for the chemotaxonomic study of 
 <italic>Pinus</italic> species.
