<p>The chemical compositions of the EOs from the needles, bark, and pollen of 
 <italic>P. eldarica</italic> were analyzed using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and are shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-03203-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> (The Gas chromatogram, condition and method are showed in the 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-24-03203">Supplementary Materials</xref>). The experimental retention indices (RI) of the chemicals in non-polar column and their percentage peak areas are also shown. The differences between the EOs of the needles, bark, and pollen were studied, and the main components of the EOs were identified. Fifty-eight constituents representing 99.98% of the needle EO, 11 components representing 99.94% of the pollen EO, and 33 components representing 99.79% of the bark EO were identified (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-03203-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The main fraction of the EO derived from the dried needles was found to consist of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (49.25% of the EO), which is in agreement with the results of previous studies [

 <xref rid="B15-molecules-24-03203" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Monoterpene hydrocarbons (32.91% of the EO) made up the main fraction of the EO derived from dried bark; this was also found in a previously reported study [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-24-03203" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In the pollen EO, monoterpene hydrocarbons (61.44% of the EO) made up the main fraction, which has not been reported previously. The EOs of the three different aerial parts of 
 <italic>P. eldarica</italic> were mostly composed of hydrocarbon compounds (
