<p>This is the first study, to our knowledge, that investigated the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of EOs from the aerial parts of 
 <italic>P. eldarica</italic> grown in northwestern Iran. The main components of the EOs were sesquiterpene hydrocarbons in the needles and monoterpene hydrocarbons in the pollen and bark. In particular, β-pinene, β-myrcene, limonene, and caryophyllene were the most abundant chemicals identified in the EOs of all three plant parts. The EOs demonstrated antimicrobial activity against some highly susceptible strains, 
 <italic>E. coli, C. albicans</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. aureus.</italic> The results of the study provide experimental evidence that EOs from aerial parts of 
 <italic>P. eldarica</italic> can be useful in the EO industry and in the development of antibiotics. In addition, 
 <italic>P. eldarica</italic>, which is widely grown in Iran, can be used to provide low-cost therapies in land surrounding the Caspian Sea.
