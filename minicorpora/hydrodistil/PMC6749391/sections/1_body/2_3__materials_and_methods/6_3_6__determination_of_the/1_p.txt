0: Briefly, the EOs were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and 180 L was serially diluted from 2000 g/mL to 10 g/mL (up to eight dilutions) in Mueller-Hinton broth (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany).
1: These dilutions were added to 96-well microplates, and 20 L of the microbial cultures were added at a concentration of 1.5  10 8 CFU/mL to reach a final volume of 200 L/well.
2: Gentamicin was used as the positive control as it is a broad-spectrum antibiotic, and normal saline/dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was used as the negative control.
3: To complete the test, each organism was suspended separately in 200 L of MuellerHinton broth.
4: C. albicans (ATCC 10231) was cultured in MuellerHinton agar supplemented with 1% glucose.
5: All the tests were performed in triplicate to ensure reliability of the results.
6: The sealed microplates were mixed on a plate shaker at 300 rpm for 30 s. They were then incubated at 37 C for 24 h and observed for growth or turbidity; subsequently, the MIC was determined.
7: The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of the EO that inhibited the visible growth of a microorganism after overnight incubation [ 45].
8: For each well showing no growth, a loopful of broth was then sub-cultured on a nutrient agar plate (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) to verify if the growth of the microorganism had been inhibited.
9: The growth of the microorganism on the solid media indicated that the specific concentration of the EO was unable to inhibit the growth of the microorganism.
