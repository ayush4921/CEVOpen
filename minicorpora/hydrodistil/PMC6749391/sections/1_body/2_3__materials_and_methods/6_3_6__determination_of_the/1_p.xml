<p>Briefly, the EOs were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and 180 µL was serially diluted from 2000 µg/mL to 10 µg/mL (up to eight dilutions) in Mueller-Hinton broth (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). These dilutions were added to 96-well microplates, and 20 µL of the microbial cultures were added at a concentration of 1.5 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/mL to reach a final volume of 200 µL/well. Gentamicin was used as the positive control as it is a broad-spectrum antibiotic, and normal saline/dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was used as the negative control. To complete the test, each organism was suspended separately in 200 µL of Mueller–Hinton broth. 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> (ATCC 10231) was cultured in Mueller–Hinton agar supplemented with 1% glucose. All the tests were performed in triplicate to ensure reliability of the results. The sealed microplates were mixed on a plate shaker at 300 rpm for 30 s. They were then incubated at 37 °C for 24 h and observed for growth or turbidity; subsequently, the MIC was determined. The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of the EO that inhibited the visible growth of a microorganism after overnight incubation [

For each well showing no growth, a loopful of broth was then sub-cultured on a nutrient agar plate (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) to verify if the growth of the microorganism had been inhibited. The growth of the microorganism on the solid media indicated that the specific concentration of the EO was unable to inhibit the growth of the microorganism.
