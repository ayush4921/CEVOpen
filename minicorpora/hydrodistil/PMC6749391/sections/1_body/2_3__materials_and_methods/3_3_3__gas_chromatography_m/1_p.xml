<p>Analysis of the EOs was carried out using a Shimadzu QP5050A GC/MS instrument (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) at the following conditions: the volume of sample injected was 1 μL; the helium carrier gas flow rate was 1.3 mL/min, with a split ratio 1:8; the injection site temperature was 270 °C; a DB-1 capillary column (60 m × 0.25 mm) was used, with a film thickness of 0.25 μm; the column temperature was 50 °C increasing at 4 °C/min to 300 °C; an ionization potential of 70 eV was used; the source temperature was 300°C; and the mass range was 30–600 m/z.</p>
