 <italic>P. eldarica</italic> bark, needles, and pollen powders (100 g) were hydro-distilled (with 1.2 L of water) in a Clevenger-type apparatus by recirculating the condensed water. The distillation was terminated after 240 min. The resulting EOs were dissolved in diethyl ether, collected, and treated with anhydrous sodium sulfate to remove excess water. The diethyl ether was removed carefully at room temperature, and the remaining EOs were stored in sealed vials at 4 Â°C until analysis.
