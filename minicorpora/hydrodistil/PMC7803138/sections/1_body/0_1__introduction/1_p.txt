0: Essential oils are secondary metabolites that plants produce for protection from pests and predators, attraction of pollinators, or seed dispersal [ 1].
1: The oils are located in different parts of the plant such as roots, stems, leaves, flowers, fruits, and even in seeds depending on the plant species [ 2].
2: In these plant parts, the essential oil is accumulated in cells, secretory cavities, or glandular hairs [ 3].
3: Almost every part of a plant can produce essential oil, which can be extracted and exploited in various industrial ways [ 4].
4: The essential oils are highly volatile [ 5], transparent, and lipid-soluble liquids [ 6].
5: They are soluble in organic solvents such as benzene, toluene, acetone, ethanol, and methanol that have less density compared with water [ 7].
