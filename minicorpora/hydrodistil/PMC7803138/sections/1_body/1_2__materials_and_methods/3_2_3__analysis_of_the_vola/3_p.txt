0: The composition of the essential oils was eluted at different retention times, identified, and obtained by the HES Auto Tune (HES ATUNE.U) by scan.
1: The chromatogram obtained was analysed, and each peak was checked by determining the percent area on the chromatogram, retention time, spectrum, and base peak and then referring to the characteristic mass spectra of compounds listed in the National Institute of standards and Technologies (NIST) using the software of Agilent Topi [ 30].
2: Their percentage relative abundances were calculated using (1)%relative abundance=peak area of the documentTotal sum of all peak areas100.
