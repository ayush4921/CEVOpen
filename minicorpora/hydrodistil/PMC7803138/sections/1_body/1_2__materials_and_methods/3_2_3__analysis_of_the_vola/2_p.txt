0: The analysis followed the modified procedure described by Omolo et al.
1: [ 29].
2: The analysis started after 3.95 minutes (solvent delay).
3: The GC condition had an initial oven temperature of 40C maintained for 3 minutes.
4: The temperature was then gradually increased with gradients of 10C/minute up to 60C, 5C/minute up to 90C, and 4C/minute up to 250C and maintained there for 8 minutes.
5: Subsequent GC working conditions utilized hydrogen gas with a constant flow of 1 ml/minute as the carrier gas and n-hexane as matrix solvent.
6: The MS working conditions comprised of an ion source and transfer line temperature maintained at 300C, a regime of injection split in a ratio of 15 : 1, a split flow of 22.5 mL/minute, and a mass range of 20300 m/z.
7: The injection was done with a 10  l injection syringe containing 1  l of injection volume at 250C injection temperature.
