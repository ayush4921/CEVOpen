 <caption> Effect of P. minus essential oil on CYP2E1 gene expression in the liver of cisplatin-induced hepatotoxicity rats. PmEO100CP and BCP groups have significantly lower expression of CYP2E1 compared to cisplatin group. In contrast, the expression of CYP2E1 was significantly higher in the PmEO400CP group. Values are mean Â± SEM (n = 6). aSignificantly different from control group at p&lt;0.05; bSignificantly different from cisplatin group p&lt;0.05. cSignificantly different from BCP group at p&lt;0.05. dSignificantly different from PmEO100CP group at p&lt;0.05. eSignificantly different from PmEO200CP group at p&lt;0.05. fSignificantly different from PmEO400CP group at p&lt;0.05. </caption>
