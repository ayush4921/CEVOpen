 <caption> Effect of P. minus essential oil on apoptosis gene expression in the liver of cisplatin-induced hepatotoxicity rats. The expression of p53, caspase 8, Bax, Apaf-1 and caspase 3 in PmEO100CP and BCP groups were significantly lower compared to cisplatin group, however, the expression of Bcl-2 showed significantly higher values. However, PmEO400CP groups showed contrary findings from PmEO100CP and BCP groups. Values are mean Â± SEM (n = 6). aSignificantly different from control group at p&lt;0.05; bSignificantly different from cisplatin group at p&lt;0.05. cSignificantly different from BCP group at p&lt;0.05. dSignificantly different from PmEO100CP group at p&lt;0.05. eSignificantly different from PmEO200CP group at p&lt;0.05. fSignificantly different from PmEO400CP group at p&lt;0.05. </caption>
