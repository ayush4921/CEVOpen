 <caption> Effect of P. minus essential oil on cytochrome c protein expression in the liver of cisplatin-induced hepatotoxicity rats. (A) Western blot analysis showed the band of the cytochrome c protein expression was less thicken and less clearer in the PmEO100CP and BCP groups compared to cisplatin group. However, the band was thick and clear in PmEO200CP and PmEO400CP. (B) Quantitated immunoblotted proteins by using densitometry showed the expression of cytochrome c protein in PmEO100CP and BCP groups was normalized to the control level. However, PmEO200CP and PmEO400CP groups showed contrary findings. Column, mean; bars, Â± SEM (n=3 independent experiments). aSignificantly different from control group at p&lt;0.05. bSignificantly different from cisplatin group at p&lt;0.05. cSignificantly different from BCP group at p&lt;0.05. dSignificantly different from PmEO100CP group at p&lt;0.05. </caption>
