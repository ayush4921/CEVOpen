0: Cancer has emerged as one of the major causes of death worldwide.
1: Cisplatin is an effective chemotherapeutic drug used to treat various types of cancers such as cancers of testis, lung, colon, cervix and ovary (Ko et al., 2014[ 50]); however its usage may also cause various side effects including hepatotoxicity.
2: Cisplatin tends to accumulate in liver (Gong et al., 2015[ 35]; Lebwohl and Canetta 1998[ 52]) and caused hepatotoxicity in cancer patients after a high dose of treatment (40 - 100 mg/m 2) (Al-Malki and Sayed, 2014[ 7]; Cersosimo, 1993[ 19]).
3: Oxidative stress plays an important role in cisplatin-induced hepatotoxicity.
4: Administration of cisplatin especially at higher dose results in hepatotoxicity via formation and activity of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Cichoz-Lach and Michalak, 2014[ 23]; Cure et al., 2016[ 25]).
5: Excessive ROS can stimulate oxidative damage through oxidation of macromolecules such as protein, lipid and DNA.
6: Dysregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and unregulated apoptosis also play an important role in cisplatin-induced hepatotoxicity (El-Shitany and Eid, 2017[ 32]).
