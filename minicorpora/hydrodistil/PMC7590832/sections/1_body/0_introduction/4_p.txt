0: Previous studies have shown that essential oil has hepatoprotective effects in various animal models (Bouzenna et al., 2016[ 14]; Jiang et al., 2019[ 43]; Morales-Lopez et al., 2017[ 58]; Ozbek et al., 2016[ 62]; Selmi et al., 2015[ 73]).
1: P. minus contains various medicinal values and yields high levels of essential oil (72.54 %) mainly of aliphatic aldehydes, terpenoids and organic acids (Baharum et al., 2010[ 10]).
2: Previous researchers also identified monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes in  P. minus essential oil including -humulene, -curcumene, -caryophyllene, -cadinene, farnesol and nerolidol (Baharum et al., 2010[ 10]; Rusdi et al., 2016[ 71]).
3: To the best of our knowledge, hepatoprotective effects of  P. minus essential oil in cisplatin-induced hepatotoxicity model is unknown although it yields high levels of essential oil with proven antioxidant activities.
4: The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate the possible protective effects of  P. minus essential oil on cisplatin-induced hepatotoxicity in adult male rats with emphasis on oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis.
