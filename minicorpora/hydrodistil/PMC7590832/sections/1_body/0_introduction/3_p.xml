<p>β-Caryophyllene is a volatile bicyclic sesquiterpene compound which is abundantly discovered in essential oils of many plants such as cloves, oregano, cinnamon, rosemary and Copaiba oil (De Almeida Borges et al., 2013[
 <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]; Khani and Heydarian, 2014[
 <xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]). It has shown to exhibit antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer activities. A previous study revealed that β-caryophyllene has therapeutic potential as a hepatoprotective effect in carbon tetrachloride-induced fibrosis (Calleja et al., 2013[
 <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]). Cho and colleagues (2015[
 <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]) also demonstrated β-caryophyllene has protective effects against liver failure induced by D-galatosamine and LPS in mice. In addition, β-Caryophyllene also effectively improved cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity and decreased the pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in rats (Horváth et al., 2012[
