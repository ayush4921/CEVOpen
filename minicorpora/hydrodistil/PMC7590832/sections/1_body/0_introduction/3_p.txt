1: It has shown to exhibit antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer activities.

3: Cho and colleagues (2015[ 22]) also demonstrated -caryophyllene has protective effects against liver failure induced by D-galatosamine and LPS in mice.
4: In addition, -Caryophyllene also effectively improved cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity and decreased the pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in rats (Horvath et al., 2012[ 39]).
