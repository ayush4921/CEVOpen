<p>A portion of rat liver was homogenized in 10 % phosphate buffered saline (0.05M, pH 7.4) and was centrifuged at 15,000 x g for 15 min at 4 Â°C. The supernatant was collected and used for measurement of glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), malondialdehyde (MDA) (Cayman Chemical, USA), protein carbonyl and 8-hydroxyde-oxyguanosine (8-OHdG). Antioxidant markers, GSH (cat. n. 703002), SOD (cat. n. 706002), catalase (cat. n. 707002), GPx (cat. n. 703102), MDA (cat. n. 1009055) (Cayman Chemical, USA) and 8-OHdG (cat. n. E-EL-0028; Elabscience, China) were all measured using commercial ELISA kits according to the manufacturer's guidelines.</p>
