0: Protein oxidation was measured with the level of protein carbonyl by using methods from Levine et al.
1: (1990[ 53]).
2: The determination of the protein carbonyl was based on the reaction with 2, 4-Dinitrophenylhydrazine forming a stable dinitrophenylhydrazone product that can be measured using a spectrophoto-meter at 370 nm.
