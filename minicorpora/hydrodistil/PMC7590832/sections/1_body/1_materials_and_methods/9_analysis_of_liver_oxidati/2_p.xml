<p>Protein oxidation was measured with the level of protein carbonyl by using methods from Levine et al. (1990[
 <xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]). The determination of the protein carbonyl was based on the reaction with 2, 4-Dinitrophenylhydrazine forming a stable dinitrophenylhydrazone product that can be measured using a spectrophoto-meter at 370 nm.
