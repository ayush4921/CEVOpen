0: P. minus essential oil compounds were identified using GC-MS analysis (Ahmad et al., 2014[ 2]) using the Clarus 600 GC-MS system (PerkinElmer, USA).
1: Volatile compounds were separated using a 30 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 m Elite-5MS column.
2: The injector port was heated to 250 C with helium as carrier gas at a constant flow of 1 mLmin -1.
3: All mass spectra were acquired in the electron impact mode (EI).
4: The MS parameters were as follows: EI mode, an ionization voltage of 70 eV, an ion source temperature of 200 C and a scan range of 40 - 600 Da.
5: The peaks were tentatively identified based on a library search using NIST and Wiley Registry 8 Edition (Ahmad et al., 2014[ 2]).
