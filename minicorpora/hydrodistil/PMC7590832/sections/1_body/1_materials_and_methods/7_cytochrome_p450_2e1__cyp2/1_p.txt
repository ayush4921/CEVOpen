0: Total RNA was isolated from the liver tissue using an RNeasy Plus Minikit (cat.
1: n. 74136; Qiagen, Germany).
2: The method was performed according to the manufacturer's guideline.
3: RNA content and purity were measured using Nanodrop (DeNovix DS-11+ Spectrophotometer, DE USA).
4: A total of 5 g of total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis using Quantinova TM Reverse Transcription Kit (cat.
5: n. 205413; Qiagen, Germany).
6: For qPCR analysis, the cDNA samples were run in triplicate and -actin was used as a reference gene.
7: Each PCR amplification cycle includes non-template controls that consist of all reagents except for cDNA.
8: qPCR reactions were performed using Quantinova SYBR  Green RT-PCR Kit (cat.
9: n. 208154; Qiagen, Germany) and was conducted using the CFX96 Touch TM Real-Time PCR Detection System (BioRad, USA).
10: After the qPCR reaction, the quantitation cycle (Cq) was determined for each sample from the amplification plot.
11: Cq value was calculated by subtraction of the -actin Cq from each sample Cq and used for data analysis.
12: PCR primers for  p53,  Caspase ( 8,  9 and  3),  Bcl-2,  Bax,  APAF-1 and  CYP2E1 were synthesized by Matrioux Sdn.
13: Bhd.
14: (Malaysia).
15: Primers were designed using the Primer-Blast program from NCBI.
16: PCR primer sequences (Table 1 (Tab.
17: 1)) were obtained in and verified using BLAST to ensure for specificity for the particular gene.
