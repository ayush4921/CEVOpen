0: Liver tissue homogenates were prepared for Western blotting as mentioned by Omar and colleagues (2016[ 60]).
1: Briefly, protein concentration in the cytosolic fraction was determined using protein assay kit (Bio Rad, USA).
2: According to Chen and colleagues (2000[ 21]), the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into cytosol is the critical early event leading to apoptosis.
3: Protein samples were then separated by SDS-PAGE (10 g per lane) and transferred onto a PVDF membrane.
4: The membrane was blocked using 5 % (w/v) of bovine serum albumin (BSA) in Tris-buffered saline with Tween-20, incubated for overnight at 4 C with primary antibody (Cytochrome C (D18C7) Rabbit, cat.
5: n. 11940; Cell Signalling, USA) with dilution factor 1:1000, rinsed and then incubated with 1:2000 secondary antibody (Anti-rabbit IgG, HRP-linked antibody; cat.
6: n. 7074; Cell Signalling, USA) for 1 hour at room temperature before the detection using Clarity Western ECL Substrate (Bio Rad, USA).
7: -Actin (-Actin (D6A8) Rabbit; cat.
8: n. 8457; Cell Signalling, USA) was used as a loading control.
9: Band density in intermediately exposed films was quantified using Image Lab TM 6.0 (Bio Rad, USA).
