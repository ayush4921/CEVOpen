0: A total of forty-two male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into seven groups: control, cisplatin, -caryophyllene 150 mg/kg (BCP),  P. minus essential oil (PmEO); PmEO 100 mg/kg + cisplatin (PmEO100CP), PmEO 200 mg/kg + cisplatin (PmEO200CP), PmEO 400 mg/kg + cisplatin (PmEO400CP) and PmEO 400 mg/kg (PmEO400).
1: Rats in the BCP, PmEO100CP, PmEO200CP, PmEO400CP and PmEO400 group received respective treatment orally for 14 consecutive days (Abd Rashid et al., 2019[ 1]; Ebada, 2018[ 31]).
2: Doses of  P. minus essential oil were chosen according to Ebada (2018[ 31]) as well as Rojas-Armas and colleagues (2019[ 70]).
3: Meanwhile, the dose of -caryophyllene was based on Horvath and colleagues (2012[ 39]).
4: -Caryophyllene served as positive control.
5: All animals except for those in the control group and PmEO400 group were administered with a single dose of cisplatin (10 mg/kg) intraperitoneally (Bishr et al., 2018[ 13]) on day 15, left untreated for three days and were sacrificed humanely on day 18 (Palipoch and Punsawad 2013[ 63]).
6: Blood samples were collected via cardiac puncture, whereas liver was excised for further analysis.
7: Supplementary Figure 1 in the supplementary data shows the flowchart of the experimental design.
