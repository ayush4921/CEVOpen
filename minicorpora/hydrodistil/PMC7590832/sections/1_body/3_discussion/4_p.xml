<p>Cisplatin-induced hepatotoxicity is characterized by an increase in serum transaminases, and less frequently by the average increase in serum ALP and total bilirubin. The serum levels of ALT and AST act as oblique assessment of liver condition because these enzymes are normally found in the cytoplasm and are only secreted into the circulation after hepatic damage (Contreras-Zentella and Hernández-Muñoz, 2016[

 <italic>P. minus</italic> essential oil in protecting against cisplatin-induced hepatotoxicity was observed from a lowered level of liver damage biomarker at the dose of 100 and 200 mg/kg. This observation might be attributed to the protective effect of 
 <italic>P. minus</italic> essential oil in reducing cell damage that may occur due to increased lipid and protein oxidation especially at the phospholipid bilayer membrane (Itri et al., 2014[
