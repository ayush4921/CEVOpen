<p>ROS can affect vital cell components especially lipid, proteins and DNA and cause cell damage (Krishnamurthy and Wadhwani, 2012[
 <xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]). Increased level of MDA and reduction in antioxidant status (GSH, GPx, SOD, and catalase) were observed in the cisplatin treated rats and this is in agreement with previous studies, i.e. Bishr and colleagues (2018[
 <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]) as well as Ahmadipour and colleagues (2015[
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]). GSH plays an important role in the detoxification of cisplatin and cell death occurs when GSH is markedly exhausted (Ince et al., 2014[
 <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]). Reduced level of GPx, SOD and catalase in the cisplatin group might be due to higher consumption of these antioxidants due to enhanced oxidative stress in the liver (Kheiripour et al., 2016[
 <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]). Supplementation with 100 mg/kg of 
 <italic>P. minus</italic> essential oil in cisplatin-treated rats caused a significant decrease in MDA, protein carbonyl, 8-OHdG level and increased the antioxidant status implicating the protective effects of 100 mg/kg 
 <italic>P. minus</italic> essential oil against cisplatin-induced hepatic oxidative damage. This finding is in agreement with previous studies which indicated that essential oil from 
 <italic>Foeniculum vulgare</italic> decreased the hepatic MDA and increased the level of GSH, GPx, SOD and catalase activity in settings of cyclophosphamide-induced genotoxicity (Tripathi et al., 2013[
 <xref rid="R80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]). In addition,
 <italic> Achillea wilhelmsii</italic> essential oil lowered the protein carbonyl level in acetaminophen-induced liver injury (Dadkhah et al., 2015[
 <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]). The activity of 
 <italic>P. minus</italic> essential oil against oxidative stress might be due to the presence of ɑ-caryophyllene and β-caryophyllene which has been previously demonstrated to act as superoxide and hydroxyl radical scavenger by previous researchers (Hana et al., 2014[
 <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]; Calleja et al., 2013[
 <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]). Cyclolongifolene oxide is the main sesquiterpene found in 
 <italic>P. minus</italic> essential oil and it was also found in high abundance in 
 <italic>Heteroxenia ghardaqensis </italic>essential oil (Farrag et al., 2019[
 <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]; Verma et al., 2011[
 <xref rid="R83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]). 
 <italic>H. ghardaqensis </italic>essential oil showed similarly high antioxidant activities and protected against DNA damage in rats (Farrag et al., 2019[
 <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]). Therefore, the reduction of 8-OHdG might be due to the presence of cyclolongifolene oxide.
