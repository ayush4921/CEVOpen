<p>TNF-α, IL-1 (α and β), IL-6 and IL-10 play an important role in regulating the interaction between inflammatory, oxidative stress and apoptotic pathways in cisplatin-induced hepatotoxicity (Shaw et al., 2011[
 <xref rid="R75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]; Tadagavadi and Reeves, 2010[
 <xref rid="R78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]). Cisplatin initiates inflammatory processes by promoting TNF-α production in residents and infiltrating immune cells (Damião et al., 2013[
 <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]). TNF-α is also secreted from activated Kupffer cells which later worsens the oxidative stress and inflammatory response in hepatocytes (Augustyniak et al., 2005[
 <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]). In this study, cisplatin produces inflammatory responses in hepatic tissues which was observed through the elevation in the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6) and decreased level of anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10). These findings are in line with Rehman and colleagues (2014[
 <xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]) who demonstrated that cisplatin also caused elevation in level of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 in liver. The present findings demonstrated that 
 <italic>P. minus</italic> essential oil at the dose of 100 mg/kg reduced the inflammatory response in liver induced by cisplatin. The supplementation of PmEO100CP lowered the level of TNF-α, IL-1α, IL-1β and IL-6 and increased the level of IL-10. The reversal of this inflammatory response might be due to the presence of sesquiterpenes in 
 <italic>P. minus</italic> essential oil that can reduce the complement activation, thus decreasing adhesion of inflammatory cells to the endothelium that results in inflammatory reaction (Chen et al., 2017[
 <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]; Rogerio et al., 2009[
 <xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]). In addition, sesquiterpenes also may inhibit metabolism of arachidonic acid which acts as inducer for pro-inflammatory activation (Hana et al., 2014[
