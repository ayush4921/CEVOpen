<p>Various studies have demonstrated that cisplatin induces apoptosis in the hepatic cells by interfering with DNA repair mechanisms, causing DNA damage and subsequently inducing apoptosis (Omar et al., 2016[
 <xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]). Cisplatin-induced apoptosis in hepatic tissue is initiated by cellular oxidative stress through the generation of ROS such as superoxide anion and hydroxyl radicals. ROS activities then modulate the activity of p53, Bax and Bcl-2 (Omar et al., 2016[
 <xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]) as well as the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol (Dasari and Tchounwou, 2014[
 <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]). This will activate caspase 8, caspase 9 (in the presence of Apaf-1) and caspase 3 (Azuma et al., 2003[
 <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]; Omar et al., 2016[
 <xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]). The present study demonstrated higher gene expression of p53, Bax, caspase 8, Apaf-1, caspase 9 and caspase 3 in cisplatin-induced hepatotoxicity which is in line with previous studies (Khan et al., 2011[
