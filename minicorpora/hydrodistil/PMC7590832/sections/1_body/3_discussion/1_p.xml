<p>The present study investigated the potentials of 
 <italic>P. minus</italic> essential oil against cisplatin-induced hepatotoxicity. Cisplatin-induced hepatotoxicity occurs through the production of reactive oxygen species which depends on the concentration of platinum compound generated during chemotherapy (Brozovic et al., 2010[
 <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]). Cisplatin causes hepatotoxicity by triggering oxidative stress and inflammation that further leads to apoptosis in liver (Bentli et al., 2013[
 <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]; Omar et al., 2016[
 <xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]). This study was carried out using 10 mg/kg/body weight of cisplatin to produce hepatotoxicity corresponding to the dose of cisplatin currently used in the clinical practice (70 mg/m
