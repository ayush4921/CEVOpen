<p>However, the result obtained from PmEO400CP showed a contrary finding compared to the PmEO100CP group which demonstrated the increased levels of liver enzymes and total bilirubin indicate the occurrence of liver injury. At higher concentration,

They found that at lower concentration of clove essential oil protects human oral mucous membrane cells from the attack of ROS, however, at higher concentration, it causes cytotoxic effect.
