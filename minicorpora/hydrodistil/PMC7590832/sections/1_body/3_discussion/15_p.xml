<p>The combination of cisplatin with higher dose of 
 <italic>P. minus</italic> essential oil increases the p53, caspase 8, Apaf-1, caspase 9 and caspase 3 expression in rat's liver. The production of higher level of ROS in PmEO400CP group activates the activity of p53 protein which further disrupts the mitochondrial membrane permeabilization by down-regulating the pro-survival protein such as Bcl-2 and upregulating pro-apoptotic protein such as Bax, caspase 8, Apaf-1, caspase 9 and caspase 3 (Redza-Dutordoir and Averill-Bates, 2016[

 <xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]) who demonstrated that the high concentration of 
 <italic>Pamburus missionis</italic> essential oil exerts the activity of apoptosis in A431 and HaCaT cells. This was due to the increased ROS level in the high concentration of 
 <italic>P. missionis</italic> essential oil. In addition, 
 <italic>P. missionis</italic> essential oil also contains aldehyde and alcohols which contribute to the increase of the ROS level in the treated cells (Pavithra et al., 2018[
