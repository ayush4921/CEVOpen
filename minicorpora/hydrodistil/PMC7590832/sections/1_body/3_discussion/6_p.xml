<p>Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) majorly expressed in the liver, enhances the formation of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide which finally produce powerful oxidants such as hydroxyl radical (Lu and Cederbaum, 2008[
 <xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]). Interaction of cisplatin with CYP2E1 promotes the production of ROS and leads to the enhancement of oxidative stress (Lu and Cederbaum, 2006[
 <xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]). In this study, supplementation of 
 <italic>P. minus</italic> essential oil at a dose of 100 mg/kg in cisplatin treated rats inhibited the 
 <italic>CYP2E1</italic> gene expression and thus it is likely to protect the liver from cisplatin toxicity. The protective effects exerted by 
 <italic>P. minus</italic> essential oil could be related to the presence of α-caryophyllene and β-caryophyllene, which have been reported to down-regulate the expression of CYP2E1 in cyclophosphamide-induced hepatotoxicity (Sheweita et al., 2016[
