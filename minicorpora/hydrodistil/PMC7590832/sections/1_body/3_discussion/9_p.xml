<p>The supplementation of 200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg of 
 <italic>P. minus</italic> essential oil in PmEO200CP and PmEO400CP group showed no significant difference in MDA, protein carbonyl, 8-OHdG and antioxidant status compared to cisplatin group. Previous study demonstrated that essential oil could also cause oxidative stress. The percentage of aldehyde in 
 <italic>P. minus</italic> essential oil is 52.47 %. Therefore, the higher dose will deliver more aldehyde to the rats. Therefore the concentration of essential oil must be chosen carefully. This finding is parallel with Lu and Cederbaum (2006[
 <xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]) who demonstrate the increase of MDA, AST and ALT level in rats treated with cisplatin and acetone. Aldehyde and acetone are much alike in many of their reactions owing to the presence of carbonyl functional group (Ouellette and Rawn, 2014[
 <xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]). Therefore, a high concentration of aldehyde that is present in a high concentration of 
 <italic>P. minus</italic> essential oil combined with cisplatin could be the possible reasons for the changes in the antioxidant status seen in the PmEO400CP group. High concentration of aldehydes in combination with cisplatin might produce high toxic free radicals which cause oxidative stress (Ahmed Laskar and Younus, 2019[
