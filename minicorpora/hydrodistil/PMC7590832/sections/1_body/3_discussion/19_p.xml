<p>The present study showed that 
 <italic>P. minus</italic> essential oil contained high concentration of long-chain aldehyde (52.47 %). A study done by Lu and Cederbaum (2006[
 <xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]) showed a combination of acetone and cisplatin in increasing the production of ROS which then potentiates the cellular oxidative stress and reduction in GSH levels in the
 <italic> in vitro</italic> model. Higher concentration of aldehyde that is present in the high concentration of 
 <italic>P. minus</italic> essential oil could be the possible reason for the pro-oxidant, pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic effects seen in PmEO400CP group.
