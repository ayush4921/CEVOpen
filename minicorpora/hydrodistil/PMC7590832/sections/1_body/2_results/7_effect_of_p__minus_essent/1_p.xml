<p>As shown in Figure 4A
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">(Fig. 4)</xref>, Western Blot analysis of cytochrome c protein expression band was a strong single band with molecular mass of ~12 kDa in the cytosolic fraction in the liver of cisplatin, PmEO200CP and PmEO400CP-treated rats. However, the cytochrome c band in control, BCP and PmEO100CP-treated rats are less clear and weaker compared to PmEO200CP and PmEO400CP. The amount of immunoblotted proteins was quantitated using densitometry. Figure 4B
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">(Fig. 4)</xref> shows that cytochrome c expression level was significantly increased in cisplatin, PmEO200CP, PmEO400CP and PmEO400 compared to control group. However, the expression level of cytochrome c was significantly decreased in BCP and PmEO100CP compared to cisplatin group. The expression level of cytochrome c in PmEO200CP, PmEO400CP and PmEO400 groups was significantly increased compared to PmEO100CP group. Supplementary Table 4 shows mean and SEM of the effect of cisplatin and
