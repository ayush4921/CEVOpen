<p>In conclusion, our results showed that 
 <italic>P. minus</italic> essential oil at low dose (100 mg/kg) might protect against cisplatin-induced hepatotoxicity via inhibition of oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis. However, at higher concentration, 
 <italic>P. minus</italic> essential oil showed pro-oxidant, pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic effects and therefore it is important to be cautious for the supplementation at higher dose to prevent any detrimental effects.
