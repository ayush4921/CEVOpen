<p>The absence of isothiocyanates in the rocket salad microgreens’ EO was quite surprising. Instead, the EO analysis revealed a composition dominated by monoterpene hydrocarbons. Myrcene, a monoterpene hydrocarbon with an herbaceous and sweetly balsamic aroma contribution [

 <italic>E. sativa</italic>, indeed, as reported by Falk et al. (2004), the first phase of the isothiocyanates biosynthesis, namely the amino acids’ side-chain elongation, takes place in two separate steps, each controlled by a different pool of enzymes [
