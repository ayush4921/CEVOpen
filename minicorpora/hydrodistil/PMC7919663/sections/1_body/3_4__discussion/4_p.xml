<p>Carotenoids, anthocyanins, polyphenols, and AsA are known as antioxidant molecules, and the antioxidant activity is an important feature for the use of microgreens as functional foods. In this work, the antioxidant activity was detected by FRAP assay and the IC
 <sub>50</sub> of DPPH radical scavenging. The obtained results are in agreement with those of other reports [
 <xref rid="B44-foods-10-00427" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]; as such, in this discussion, we highlighted the correlation between the antioxidant activity and the correlated compounds. The details of the correlation analysis are provided in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-foods-10-00427">Table S1</xref>. Daikon microgreens exhibited the highest antioxidant activity, which was essentially due to their high level of polyphenols (comparable to that of broccoli), ascorbic acid, and carotenoids (similar to that of rocket salad and broccoli). A strong correlation (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-foods-10-00427">Table S1</xref>) was confirmed for polyphenols and ascorbic acid. On the other hand, for adult daikon plants, the antioxidant activity is attributable to their high level of both polyphenols and anthocyanins [
 <xref rid="B45-foods-10-00427" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. A high antioxidant activity was also highlighted in broccoli microgreens, which was only slightly lower than that of daikon, as reported by Paradiso et al. [
 <xref rid="B46-foods-10-00427" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and Di Bella et al. [
 <xref rid="B47-foods-10-00427" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. This activity can be attributed to polyphenols, carotenoids, and anthocyanins, and it reflects the results obtained by Jagdish et al. [
 <xref rid="B48-foods-10-00427" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. However, during growth, the adult plants showed high levels of polyphenols and anthocyanins, but not of carotenoids [
 <xref rid="B49-foods-10-00427" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Watercressâ€™ radical-scavenging activity was mainly attributed to its consistent level of carotenoids, which is in agreement with Amiri [
 <xref rid="B50-foods-10-00427" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. On the other hand, the adult watercress plant has a low content of carotenoids, while the content of anthocyanins and polyphenols is high [
 <xref rid="B51-foods-10-00427" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The low concentration of polyphenols and carotenoids can play a role in the very low scavenging activity detected in mustard [
 <xref rid="B6-foods-10-00427" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], although it showed the highest content of ascorbic acid and anthocyanins compared to the others. The adult mustard plant maintains elevated levels of ascorbic acid, and its carotenoid content increases [
 <xref rid="B52-foods-10-00427" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. A very low scavenging activity was also detected in rocket salad, due to its low level of both anthocyanins and ascorbic acid, as confirmed by previous studies carried out for the evaluation of its antioxidant activity [
 <xref rid="B53-foods-10-00427" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. It also exhibited high levels of carotenoids, which were comparable to those of broccoli and daikon plants. The adult plant, like the microgreen, according to Abdalla [
 <xref rid="B54-foods-10-00427" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], has low levels of ascorbic acid.
