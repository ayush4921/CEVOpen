<p>Plant water content is an important factor in establishing the turgor of plant cells; an adequate presence of water in plant cells ensures optimal metabolism, in terms of (i) the absorption of salts from the outside (soil or substrate), (ii) proper evapotranspiration, (iii) the regulation of the leaf temperature, and iv) the photosynthetic process [

The highest percentage of water was measured in daikon microgreens (93.59%), as was predictable due to their fleshy leaves, while in the other analyzed species it was higher than 85%. The percentage of dry matter was low and stable in all of the species, and it was comparable with that of some already-published studies on microgreens, especially for daikon, broccoli [
