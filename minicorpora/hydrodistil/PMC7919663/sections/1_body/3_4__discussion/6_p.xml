<p>For broccoli microgreens, isothiocyanates dominated their EO composition; these compounds were also detected with relevant relative concentrations in adult specimens from France and Italy, although their compositions were, instead, dominated by cyanides [
 <xref rid="B55-foods-10-00427" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The most abundant compound in broccoli microgreens’ EO which was measured present study was 4-Pentenyl isothiocyanate, which is reported to be an aroma-active compound, the contribution of which is defined as acrid, pungent, and mustard-like, and it is also found in wasabi, in which it contributes to its pungency [
 <xref rid="B24-foods-10-00427" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Phenethyl isothiocyanate follows as the second most represented compound; its aroma contribution is also reported as pungent, and it is also described as being able to cause a tingling sensation in the mouth [

 <italic>B. oleracea</italic> var. 
 <italic>italica</italic>, glucoraphanin, and other isothiocyanates showed a decrement from the start of seed germination to the flowering stages [
