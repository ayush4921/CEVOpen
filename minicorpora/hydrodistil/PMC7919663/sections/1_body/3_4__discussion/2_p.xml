<p>Color is a fundamental characteristic which is linked to the quality of vegetables, and which strongly affects consumers’ preferences. In the case of microgreens, the color of the stem, cotyledons and/or of the first true leaves is of great importance; some producers offer heterogeneous chromatic products, and they recall it with fancy names [

The total chlorophyll content (the sum of Chl a and b) was 793 µg/g for daikon, and 1391 µg/g was measured in mustard; these results are in agreement with those of Kopsell et al. [

However, in the present report, some data differed from other data that have already been published; these discrepancies can be attributed to different cultivation techniques—e.g., greenhouse conditions—and to differences in the used soil. In the present work, the microgreens were cultivated in an organic substrate instead of the frequently used soilless or hydroponic culture [
