<p>Gas-Chromatography—Electron-Impact Mass Spectrometry (GC/EI-MS) analyses were performed with an Agilent 7890B gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with an Agilent HP-5MS (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm; coating thickness 0.25 μm) and an Agilent 5977B single quadrupole mass detector (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA). The operating conditions were as follows: oven temperature programmed rising from 60 °C to 240 °C at 3 °C /min; injector temperature 220 °C; transfer-line temperature 240 °C; carrier gas He (1 mL/min). For each EO, the injection volume was 1 μL.</p>
