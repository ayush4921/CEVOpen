0: For each species, 300 g fresh leaves were cut and subjected to hydrodistillation in a Clevenger-type apparatus for 3 hours.
1: As all of the samples did not yield enough essential oil to be gathered in its purity, 0.5 mL of  n-hexane HPLC grade was inserted into the Clevenger apparatus in order to capture the volatile fraction hydrodistilled from the plant material.
2: Thus, the hydrodistillation yield could not be calculated (<0.1%  w/ w).
3: All of the hydrodistillations were performed in triplicates.
