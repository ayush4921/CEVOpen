<p>For each species, 300 g fresh leaves were cut and subjected to hydrodistillation in a Clevenger-type apparatus for 3 hours. As all of the samples did not yield enough essential oil to be gathered in its purity, 0.5 mL of 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane HPLC grade was inserted into the Clevenger apparatus in order to capture the volatile fraction hydrodistilled from the plant material. Thus, the hydrodistillation yield could not be calculated (&lt;0.1%
