<p>The hierarchical cluster (HCA) and principal component (PCA) analyses of the complete EO compositions were performed in JMP 13.2.0 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). The HCA was conducted using Ward’s algorithm on normalized data, using Euclidean distances as a measure of similarity. To perform the PCA, linear regressions were operated on the mean-centered data of the covariance matrix, in order to select the two highest principal components (PCs). The collected data-set was a 5 × 50 matrix (5 samples, 50 individual compounds). This unsupervised method reduced the dimensionality of the multivariate data of the matrix while preserving most of the variance [
