0: The hierarchical cluster (HCA) and principal component (PCA) analyses of the complete EO compositions were performed in JMP 13.2.0 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).
1: The HCA was conducted using Wards algorithm on normalized data, using Euclidean distances as a measure of similarity.
2: To perform the PCA, linear regressions were operated on the mean-centered data of the covariance matrix, in order to select the two highest principal components (PCs).
3: The collected data-set was a 5  50 matrix (5 samples, 50 individual compounds).
4: This unsupervised method reduced the dimensionality of the multivariate data of the matrix while preserving most of the variance [ 36].
5: The chosen PC1 and PC2 covered 44.8% and 31.8% of the variance, respectively, for a total of 76.6% of the observed data.
