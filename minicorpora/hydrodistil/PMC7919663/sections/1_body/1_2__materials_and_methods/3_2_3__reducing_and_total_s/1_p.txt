0: The reducing sugars were determined using 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) reagent, prepared as described by Teixeira et al.
1: [ 31]: 10 g/L DNS, 16 g/L sodium hydroxide, and 300 g/L sodium potassium tartrate.
2: The fresh samples were extracted according to Li et al.
3: [ 32], with some modification.
4: In brief, 200 mg were extracted at 80 C for 30 min with 2 mL 80% ethanol and 1 mL hot distilled water.
5: After 10 minutes at the maximum centrifuge speed, the supernatant was collected, and the extraction procedure was repeated once.
6: The final extraction volume was taken up to a volume of 10 mL with distilled water, and was used to determine both the reducing and total soluble sugars.
