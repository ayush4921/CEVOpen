<p>The reducing sugars were determined using 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) reagent, prepared as described by Teixeira et al. [
 <xref rid="B31-foods-10-00427" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]: 10 g/L DNS, 16 g/L sodium hydroxide, and 300 g/L sodium potassium tartrate. The fresh samples were extracted according to Li et al. [
 <xref rid="B32-foods-10-00427" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], with some modification. In brief, 200 mg were extracted at 80 Â°C for 30 min with 2 mL 80% ethanol and 1 mL hot distilled water. After 10 minutes at the maximum centrifuge speed, the supernatant was collected, and the extraction procedure was repeated once. The final extraction volume was taken up to a volume of 10 mL with distilled water, and was used to determine both the reducing and total soluble sugars.
