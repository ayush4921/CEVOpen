<p>The seeds of broccoli (

 <italic>italica</italic> L.), daikon (

 <italic>sativus</italic> (L.) Domin), mustard (

 <italic>mairei</italic> (L.) Czern.), rocket salad (
 <italic>Eruca vesicaria</italic> var. 
 <italic>sativa</italic> (L.) Cav.), and watercress (
 <italic>Nasturtium officinale</italic> var. 
 <italic>microphyllum</italic> R.Br.) were sown in May and June 2019 in 10 cm diameter pots, and were left to germinate for two days at 24 °C on a germination plateau. The microgreens were grown in a Brill Orto-pack Bio (MT) (Agrochimica S.p.A., Bolzano, Italy) organic substrate consisting of blonde peat (fraction 0–5), coir (light fraction) and black peat (fraction 0–6), with a bulk density of 270-320 g/L, an air volume of 20/25%, and a water retention capacity of 5.8 g/g. The substrate was characterized as follows: pH 5.5–6.5; EC &lt; 1 mS/cm; N 365 mg/L; P 125 mg/L; K 167.5 mg/L; Mg 12mg/L; Fe 15mg/L; S 38mg/L. No fertilizers or nutrient solutions were provided. Irrigation took place daily by sprinkling without the use of fertilizers or nutritional solutions. On the third day, the pots were moved to the greenhouse at 30 °C during the day and 20 °C at night, with a photoperiod of 16 h:8 h (day:night). The light intensity was between 100.000 and 150.000 lux. All of the species were harvested after 14 days of germination, when they presented fully expanded and turgid cotyledons and the presence of their first true leaves. Harvesting was achieved by cutting the hypocotyls, the length of which ranged between 5 cm in broccoli and 7 cm in watercress. The fresh samples were weighed (Mo) and dried in an oven for 24 h at 60 °C, to their final constant dried weight (M). The percentage of dry matter (DM) was determined according to the following equation: DM (%) = [(Mo − M)/Mo] × 100; the percentage of their water content (WC) was determined as WC % = 100 (%) − DM (%). The collected material was used fresh or stored at −80 °C for further analysis.
