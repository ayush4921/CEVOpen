0: The seeds of broccoli ( Brassica oleracea var.
1: italica L.), daikon ( Raphanus raphanistrum var.
2: sativus (L.) Domin), mustard ( Brassica juncea var.
3: mairei (L.) Czern.
4: ), rocket salad ( Eruca vesicaria var.
5: sativa (L.) Cav.
6: ), and watercress ( Nasturtium officinale var.
7: microphyllum R.Br.)
8: were sown in May and June 2019 in 10 cm diameter pots, and were left to germinate for two days at 24 C on a germination plateau.
9: The microgreens were grown in a Brill Orto-pack Bio (MT) (Agrochimica S.p.A., Bolzano, Italy) organic substrate consisting of blonde peat (fraction 05), coir (light fraction) and black peat (fraction 06), with a bulk density of 270-320 g/L, an air volume of 20/25%, and a water retention capacity of 5.8 g/g.
10: The substrate was characterized as follows: pH 5.56.5; EC< 1 mS/cm; N 365 mg/L; P 125 mg/L; K 167.5 mg/L; Mg 12mg/L; Fe 15mg/L; S 38mg/L.
11: No fertilizers or nutrient solutions were provided.
12: Irrigation took place daily by sprinkling without the use of fertilizers or nutritional solutions.
13: On the third day, the pots were moved to the greenhouse at 30 C during the day and 20 C at night, with a photoperiod of 16 h:8 h (day:night).
14: The light intensity was between 100.000 and 150.000 lux.
15: All of the species were harvested after 14 days of germination, when they presented fully expanded and turgid cotyledons and the presence of their first true leaves.
16: Harvesting was achieved by cutting the hypocotyls, the length of which ranged between 5 cm in broccoli and 7 cm in watercress.
17: The fresh samples were weighed (Mo) and dried in an oven for 24 h at 60 C, to their final constant dried weight (M).
18: The percentage of dry matter (DM) was determined according to the following equation: DM (%) = [(Mo  M)/Mo]  100; the percentage of their water content (WC) was determined as WC % = 100 (%)  DM (%).
19: The collected material was used fresh or stored at 80 C for further analysis.
