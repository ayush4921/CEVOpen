0: The aerial part of the fresh seedlings (200 mg) was used for the determination of the pigments (chlorophylls and carotenoids) by extraction in 100% methanol, following the known literature [ 25].
1: Fresh samples (200 mg) were extracted by homogenization in 2 mL 70% ( v/v) methanol.
2: After 30 min of incubation at 4 C, the extracts were centrifuged at the maximum speed for 10 min, and the supernatants were also used for the determination of the total polyphenols by the FolinCiocalteau method, and the determination of the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH) antiradical activity, according to the published protocols [ 26], using an Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-VIS) spectrophotometer (SHIMADZU UV-1800, Shimadzu Corp., Kyoto, Japan).
3: The DPPH activity was determined as IC 50 (mg/mL), namely the extract concentration required to obtain 50% of antioxidant activity.
4: The extracts were also tested with a Ferric ion Reducing Antioxidant Power (FRAP) antioxidant assay in order to confirm the antioxidant activity [ 27].
5: The total polyphenols content (TPC) was expressed as mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE) per g of fresh weight (FW).
6: The anthocyanins were extracted from 0.1 g fresh leaves in ethanol/HCl (99/1,  v/v), and were used to read the absorbance at 535 nm [ 28].
7: The total anthocyanin content (TAnth) was expressed as g malvin-chloride equivalents (ME) per g of FW.
8: The data presented are the mean of three independent replicates.
