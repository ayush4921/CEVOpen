<p>In the last decade, the interest in microgreens has grown, as they meet consumersâ€™ preference for their novelty, palatability, and ease of use, all coupled with desirable health-related benefits ensured by their nutritionally valuable compositions. They are also interesting for the producers, as they have very few production requirements, and they reach their ideal growth for consumption quite quickly. Many species are eligible for microgreens production; however, Brassicaceae spp. are among the most popular.</p>
