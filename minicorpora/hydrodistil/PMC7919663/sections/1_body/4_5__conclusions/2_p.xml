<p>All of the five Brassicaceae species analyzed in the present work showed noteworthy nutritional characteristics, and they all had quite comparable antioxidant properties, which were due to the different combinations of antioxidant compounds present in their compositions. Thus, the choice between these five species could be mainly driven by consumers’ preference of their aroma profile. Broccoli and watercress were characterized by strong and pungent aroma-active compounds, as are typical of the expected Brassicaceae bouquet. Mustard microgreens, while still rich in allyl isothiocyanate’s pungent flavor, had a more delicate aroma, given the relevant presence of phytol; the same intermediate character was found for daikon microgreens. Rocket salad microgreens, instead, were characterized by the absence of isothiocyanates, as is typically associated to Brassicaceae’s peculiar aroma.</p>
