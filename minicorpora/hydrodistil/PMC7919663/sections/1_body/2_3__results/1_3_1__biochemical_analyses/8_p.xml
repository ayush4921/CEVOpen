<p>The largest vitamin C (total AsA) content was detected in mustard (606.87 µg/g FW). In broccoli, daikon, and watercress, the AsA content was about fourfold lower than that in mustard, but very similar to each other (124.1–137.52 µg/g FW). A rather low content was detected in rocket salad (29.67 µg/g FW). Lastly, the reduced AsA content was extremely high in mustard (366.07 µg/g FW), and about 10 times lower in rocket salad (25.86 µg/g FW) and watercress (38.55 µg/g FW).</p>
