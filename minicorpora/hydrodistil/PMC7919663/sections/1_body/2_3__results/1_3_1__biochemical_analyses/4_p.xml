<p>The growth condition of the microgreens can be evaluated by their chlorophyll content. The highest (statistically different) content of chlorophyll a (Chl a) was found in mustard (982.3 µg/g FW), followed by broccoli (737.8 µg/g FW), and rocket salad, daikon, and watercress, which showed similar values to one another (681.8, 623.6 and 584.8 µg/g FW, respectively). A similar trend was observed for the content of chlorophyll b (Chl b), of which mustard showed the highest level (409.2 µg/g FW), followed by watercress (233.0 µg/g FW) and broccoli (223.9 µg/g FW), while its lowest concentration was found in daikon and rocket salad (170.3 and 131.8 µg/g FW, respectively). The total chlorophyll content reflects the sum of the single chlorophyll content, of which mustard showed the highest content, while daikon showed the lowest. The Chl a/Chl b ratio was in the range of 2.51–3.66, with the exception of rocket salad (5.22); the generally accepted ratio which is considered an index of optimal plant growth is above 2.5–3.</p>
