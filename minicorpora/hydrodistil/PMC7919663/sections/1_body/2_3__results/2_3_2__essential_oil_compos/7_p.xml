<p>The hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) of all of the EO compositions distributed the samples into two main macro-clusters (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00427-f002">Figure 2</xref>). The first macro-cluster comprises two sub-groups (red and green), while the second comprises only one (blue). Rocket salad’s EO was clustered by itself in the blue group. Watercress’ EO represented a group of its own, as well, but its composition was closer to that of the red samples, as they were all in the same macro-cluster.
