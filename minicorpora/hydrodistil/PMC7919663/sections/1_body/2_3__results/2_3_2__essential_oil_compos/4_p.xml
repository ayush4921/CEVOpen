<p>Isothiocyanates represented over 40% of mustardâ€™s EO composition; among them, allyl and 3-butenyl isothiocyanates were the most abundant, accounting for up to 22.7% and 14.1%, respectively. Phytol, however, showed the highest relative abundance in this EO as an individual compound, as it was detected with a relative abundance of 28.4%. Non-terpene derivatives added up to 12.7% of the total composition, with (
