<p>All of these compositionally-positive aspects are coupled with a relatively easy production process, as they only need water, light, and a substrate to grow on. Different cultivation systems can affect their production, such as the use of soilless practices (peat moss, vermiculite, and perlite). The important role played by different light intensities (sunlight or UV) and light-emitting diodes in the growth of sprouts and microgreens has recently been reported [

Furthermore, their production can also be intended for consumers who need special diets, such as in the case of patients with kidney problems or nutritional deficiencies. Microgreens, for example, can be grown on substrates enriched with iron, and therefore support the resolution of iron-deficiencyâ€“related diseases [

Broccoli microgreens, for example, require approximately 200 times less water and need 95% less time to grow than mature broccoli; moreover, they do not require the application of fertilizers or pesticides [
