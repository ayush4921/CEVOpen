<p>In the present study, microgreens of five Brassicaceae species were analyzed: broccoli (
 <italic>Brassica oleracea</italic> L.), daikon (
 <italic>Raphanus raphanistrum</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>sativus</italic> (L.) Domin), mustard (
 <italic>Brassica juncea</italic> (L.) Czern.), rocket salad (
 <italic>Eruca vesicaria</italic> (L.) Cav.), and watercress (
 <italic>Nasturtium officinale</italic> R.Br.). For each species, selected phytochemical compounds with nutritional value (chlorophylls, polyphenols, carotenoids, anthocyanins, ascorbic acid, total and reduced sugars), their antioxidant activity, and the composition of their essential oils were evaluated. The aim was to assess the individual characteristics of each species, in order to obtain a more complete overview of their potential nutritional value, as well as their aroma-distinctive compounds.
