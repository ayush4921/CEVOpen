0: Microgreens are young shoots of horticultural and herbaceous species; they consist of the fully developed cotyledons and the first true leaves, differing from sprouts since roots are eliminated before their consumption as food [ 2].
1: They are typically consumed between 7 and 14 days after germination, whendespite their small sizethey already have an intense flavor, a crunchy texture, a very vivid color, andmost importantlythey show interesting beneficial properties for human health, making them an opportunity for both the food industry and the pharmaceutical market [ 3].
2: Thanks to their significant content of bioactive compounds, in fact, microgreens can be considered functional foods, representing sources of protein, fat, vitamins, and sugars [ 4, 5].
3: Compared to the seeds and adult plants of the same species, microgreens hyperaccumulate phytochemicals by, on average, 10 times more.
4: In particular, they contain few antinutrients, and they are rich in amino acids and mineral salts (Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Zn, Se, and Mo), as well as secondary metabolites, such as polyphenols, anthocyanins, carotenoids and ascorbic acid in higher concentrations compared to mature plants [ 2, 6].
5: On the other hand, these shoots contain lower nitrate levels than their mature-leaf counterparts [ 7].
6: Researchers have provided a lot of information and reviews on the nutritional traits of microgreens, because they are affected by different cultivars or landraces, plant growth stages [ 8], and environmental conditions.
