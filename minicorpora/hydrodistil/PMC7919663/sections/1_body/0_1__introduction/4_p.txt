0: The vegetable species used in microgreen production belong to several botanical families, such as Asteraceae, Apiaceae, Amarillydaceae, Amaranthaceae, Brassicaceae, Cucurbitaceae, and Fabaceae, for which several different phytochemicals with antioxidant and healthy properties have been reported.
1: Most of the published studies involved Fabaceae and Brassicaceae [ 2, 13, 14]; microgreens belonging to the latter family, in particular, were reported as good sources of K, Ca, Fe and Zn [ 15].
2: The phytochemical composition of Brassicaceae varies considerably as a consequence of the plant growth stage and the analyzed species [ 16].
3: Glucosinolates are a class of sulfur-rich thioglucoside natural products, present in the Brassicaceae members and related families [ 17], of which over 120 individual compounds have been identified [ 18].
4: They are stored in cell vacuoles; once the plant cell is damaged, they are exposed to myrosinases, a pool of thioglucosydase enzymes produced by thioglucosinolates-synthesizing plants, which release isothiocyanates and other hydrolyzed derivatives [ 17, 19].
5: These hydrolysis compounds, used as a defense mechanism against herbivores and parasites in glucosinolates-producing species [ 20], are also important in human health, as they have been reported as cancer-preventing compounds of great nutritional value in a balanced and healthy diet [ 21].
6: Their release during the consumption of these species is triggered by mastication, during which the same release of glucosinolates from the vacuoles and their subsequent contact and hydrolysis by myrosinases occur, thus releasing the hydrolysis products.
7: Both glucosinolates and isothiocyanates are involved in the perception of the distinctive aroma and taste of Brassicaceae species [ 22, 23]; in particular, the former are mainly responsible for their bitterness, while the latter for their pungency, although this sometimes varies for some individual compounds of this chemical class [ 24].
