<p>Microgreens are young shoots of horticultural and herbaceous species; they consist of the fully developed cotyledons and the first true leaves, differing from sprouts since roots are eliminated before their consumption as food [
 <xref rid="B2-foods-10-00427" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. They are typically consumed between 7 and 14 days after germination, when—despite their small size—they already have an intense flavor, a crunchy texture, a very vivid color, and—most importantly—they show interesting beneficial properties for human health, making them an opportunity for both the food industry and the pharmaceutical market [

In particular, they contain few antinutrients, and they are rich in amino acids and mineral salts (Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Zn, Se, and Mo), as well as secondary metabolites, such as polyphenols, anthocyanins, carotenoids and ascorbic acid in higher concentrations compared to mature plants [
