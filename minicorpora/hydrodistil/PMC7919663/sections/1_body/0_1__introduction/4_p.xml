<p>The vegetable species used in microgreen production belong to several botanical families, such as Asteraceae, Apiaceae, Amarillydaceae, Amaranthaceae, Brassicaceae, Cucurbitaceae, and Fabaceae, for which several different phytochemicals with antioxidant and healthy properties have been reported. Most of the published studies involved Fabaceae and Brassicaceae [

 <xref rid="B14-foods-10-00427" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]; microgreens belonging to the latter family, in particular, were reported as good sources of K, Ca, Fe and Zn [

 <xref rid="B16-foods-10-00427" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Glucosinolates are a class of sulfur-rich thioglucoside natural products, present in the Brassicaceae members and related families [
 <xref rid="B17-foods-10-00427" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], of which over 120 individual compounds have been identified [
 <xref rid="B18-foods-10-00427" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. They are stored in cell vacuoles; once the plant cell is damaged, they are exposed to myrosinases, a pool of thioglucosydase enzymes produced by thioglucosinolates-synthesizing plants, which release isothiocyanates and other hydrolyzed derivatives [

 <xref rid="B19-foods-10-00427" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. These hydrolysis compounds, used as a defense mechanism against herbivores and parasites in glucosinolates-producing species [
 <xref rid="B20-foods-10-00427" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], are also important in human health, as they have been reported as cancer-preventing compounds of great nutritional value in a balanced and healthy diet [
 <xref rid="B21-foods-10-00427" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Their release during the consumption of these species is triggered by mastication, during which the same release of glucosinolates from the vacuoles and their subsequent contact and hydrolysis by myrosinases occur, thus releasing the hydrolysis products. Both glucosinolates and isothiocyanates are involved in the perception of the distinctive aroma and taste of Brassicaceae species [

 <xref rid="B23-foods-10-00427" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]; in particular, the former are mainly responsible for their bitterness, while the latter for their pungency, although this sometimes varies for some individual compounds of this chemical class [
