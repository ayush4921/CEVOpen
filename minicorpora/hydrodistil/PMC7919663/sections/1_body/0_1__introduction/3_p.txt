0: All of these compositionally-positive aspects are coupled with a relatively easy production process, as they only need water, light, and a substrate to grow on.
1: Different cultivation systems can affect their production, such as the use of soilless practices (peat moss, vermiculite, and perlite).
2: The important role played by different light intensities (sunlight or UV) and light-emitting diodes in the growth of sprouts and microgreens has recently been reported [ 9, 10].
3: The possibility of micro-scale production and their high nutritional value make them excellent candidates for the preparation of functional salads for astronauts [ 11].
4: Furthermore, their production can also be intended for consumers who need special diets, such as in the case of patients with kidney problems or nutritional deficiencies.
5: Microgreens, for example, can be grown on substrates enriched with iron, and therefore support the resolution of iron-deficiencyrelated diseases [ 12], or on substrates almost totally starved of potassium, allowing patients suffering from impaired kidney function to include vegetables in their diet without risks [ 11].
6: Microgreens also offer the opportunity to increase the sustainability of vegetable production.
7: Broccoli microgreens, for example, require approximately 200 times less water and need 95% less time to grow than mature broccoli; moreover, they do not require the application of fertilizers or pesticides [ 12].
