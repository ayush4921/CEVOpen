0: The human pulmonary epithelial carcinoma-derived A549 lung epithelial cell line was kindly provided from Prof. Ahn, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.
1: The cells were cultured in Dulbeccos Modified Eagles Medium (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 C and 5% CO 2 atmosphere.
2: A549 cells were seeded in 6 well plates at 7.5  10 5 cells/well until 80% confluence.
3: Then, cells were exposed to 100 g/mL of PM 10 in the presence of 10 5, 10 4 and 10 3 /mL ( v/ v %) of MEO for 24 h. Urban dust SRM 1649b, as known as PM 10, was provided from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (Gaithersburg, MD, USA).
