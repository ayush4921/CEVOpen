<p>The human pulmonary epithelial carcinoma-derived A549 lung epithelial cell line was kindly provided from Prof. Ahn, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Republic of Korea. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco′s Modified Eagle′s Medium (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere. A549 cells were seeded in 6 well plates at 7.5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well until 80% confluence. Then, cells were exposed to 100 μg/mL of PM
 <sub>10</sub> in the presence of 10
 <sup>−5</sup>, 10
 <sup>−4</sup> and 10
 <sup>−3</sup> /mL (
