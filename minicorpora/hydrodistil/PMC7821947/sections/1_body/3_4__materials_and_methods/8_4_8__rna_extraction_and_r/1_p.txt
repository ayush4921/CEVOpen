0: RNA from A549 cells was extracted using the TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer guidelines.
1: 1 g of RNA was synthesized into cDNA with Maxime RT premix (Invitrogen Corp.) at 45 C for 60 min and then at 95 C for 5 min.
2: Then, analysis of gene expression was performed in triplicates using a Maxime PCR premix kit (Invitrogen Corp.).
3: Electrophoresed PCR products were visualized under UV light after ethidium bromide staining.
4: The relative expression levels of target genes were normalized using GAPDH as an internal control.
5: Relative band densities were determined using an Image J computerized densitometry system.
