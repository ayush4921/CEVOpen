<p>RNA from A549 cells was extracted using the TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer guidelines. 1 μg of RNA was synthesized into cDNA with Maxime RT premix (Invitrogen Corp.) at 45 °C for 60 min and then at 95 °C for 5 min. Then, analysis of gene expression was performed in triplicates using a Maxime PCR premix kit (Invitrogen Corp.). Electrophoresed PCR products were visualized under UV light after ethidium bromide staining. The relative expression levels of target genes were normalized using GAPDH as an internal control. Relative band densities were determined using an Image J computerized densitometry system.</p>
