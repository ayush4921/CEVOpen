<p>After treatment with PM
 <sub>10</sub> and MEO, A549 cells were cultured and lysed with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.4), 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mM NaCl) supplemented with a protease inhibitor (Roche, Hoffmann, Valdese, NC, USA). The quantified 10 μg of protein by Bradford method was separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Then, separated proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. 3% bovine serum albumin in Tris-Buffered Saline with 0.1% Tween 20 was incubated in membrane to reduce the non-specific antibody binding. Membranes were incubated overnight with primary antibodies (Cell signaling, Beverly, MA, USA) at 4 °C and continued to incubate with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Cell signaling). Signals were detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). Relative band densities were determined using an Image J computerized densitometry system. The experiments were carried out in triplicate measurements.
