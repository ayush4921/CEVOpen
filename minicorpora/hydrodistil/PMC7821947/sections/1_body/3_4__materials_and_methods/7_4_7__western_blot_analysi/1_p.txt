0: After treatment with PM 10 and MEO, A549 cells were cultured and lysed with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (50 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.4), 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mM NaCl) supplemented with a protease inhibitor (Roche, Hoffmann, Valdese, NC, USA).
1: The quantified 10 g of protein by Bradford method was separated by sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
2: Then, separated proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane.
3: 3% bovine serum albumin in Tris-Buffered Saline with 0.1% Tween 20 was incubated in membrane to reduce the non-specific antibody binding.
4: Membranes were incubated overnight with primary antibodies (Cell signaling, Beverly, MA, USA) at 4 C and continued to incubate with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Cell signaling).
5: Signals were detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden).
6: Relative band densities were determined using an Image J computerized densitometry system.
7: The experiments were carried out in triplicate measurements.
