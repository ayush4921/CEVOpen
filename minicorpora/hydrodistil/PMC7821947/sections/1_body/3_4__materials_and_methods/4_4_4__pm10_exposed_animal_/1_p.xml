<p>The experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee of Kyung Hee University in Korea (KHUASP(SE)-19-098; Seoul, Korea). Female BALB/c mice aged 5 weeks were obtained from Raonbio Inc. (Yongin, Korea) and housed in plastic cages. All mice were kept under a 12 h light/dark cycle at a temperature of 22 ± 2 °C and relative humidity of 55 ± 10%. After 1 week of accumulation, mice were randomly subjected into 4 groups (
 <italic>n</italic> = 7); (1) CTR, normal mice, (2) PM
 <sub>10</sub>, PM
 <sub>10</sub> and ovalbumin (OVA)-exposed mice treated with vehicle, (3) PM
 <sub>10</sub> + DEX, PM
 <sub>10</sub> and OVA-exposed mice treated with DEX as positive control and (4) PM
 <sub>10</sub> + MEO, PM
 <sub>10</sub> and OVA-exposed mice treated with MEO. All mice except CTR group were intraperitoneally injected 10 μg OVA emulsified in 500 μg aluminum hydroxide with a total volume of 0.1 mL saline on day 0, 7, and 15. Following the sensitization, mice were challenged with 1 mg OVA and 100 μg PM
 <sub>10</sub> supplemented in 50 μL saline by intranasal instillation on day 21, 22. To inhale saline, DEX and MEO, we self-manufactured exposure chamber with nebulizer (Philips, Amsterdam, Netherlands). The tips of 50 mL conical tubes were cut into 1 cm and sealed with plastic round container. The container was connected to nebulizer, and then mice were loaded into the conical tubes to expose the vapor [

 <sub>10</sub> groups were received saline. DEX at a concentration of 2 mg/kg (calculated to 0.06% in saline) was treated to mice to PM
 <sub>10</sub> + DEX group by nebulizer. The mice of PM
 <sub>10</sub> + MEO group were nebulized with 0.1
