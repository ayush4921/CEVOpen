0: The experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee of Kyung Hee University in Korea (KHUASP(SE)-19-098; Seoul, Korea).
1: Female BALB/c mice aged 5 weeks were obtained from Raonbio Inc. (Yongin, Korea) and housed in plastic cages.
2: All mice were kept under a 12 h light/dark cycle at a temperature of 22  2 C and relative humidity of 55  10%.
3: After 1 week of accumulation, mice were randomly subjected into 4 groups ( n = 7); (1) CTR, normal mice, (2) PM 10, PM 10 and ovalbumin (OVA)-exposed mice treated with vehicle, (3) PM 10 + DEX, PM 10 and OVA-exposed mice treated with DEX as positive control and (4) PM 10 + MEO, PM 10 and OVA-exposed mice treated with MEO.
4: All mice except CTR group were intraperitoneally injected 10 g OVA emulsified in 500 g aluminum hydroxide with a total volume of 0.1 mL saline on day 0, 7, and 15.
5: Following the sensitization, mice were challenged with 1 mg OVA and 100 g PM 10 supplemented in 50 L saline by intranasal instillation on day 21, 22.
6: To inhale saline, DEX and MEO, we self-manufactured exposure chamber with nebulizer (Philips, Amsterdam, Netherlands).
7: The tips of 50 mL conical tubes were cut into 1 cm and sealed with plastic round container.
8: The container was connected to nebulizer, and then mice were loaded into the conical tubes to expose the vapor [ 39].
9: Sprayed amount of nebulizer was 1 mL/min.
10: CTR and PM 10 groups were received saline.
11: DEX at a concentration of 2 mg/kg (calculated to 0.06% in saline) was treated to mice to PM 10 + DEX group by nebulizer.
12: The mice of PM 10 + MEO group were nebulized with 0.1  v/ v % of MEO in self-manufactured exposure chamber.
13: All treatments were performed for 5 min once a day from day 0 to day 23.
14: At the end of the experiment on day 24, mice were sacrificed.
