<p>Lung tissues were fixed in 10% neutralized formalin for 24 h and then dehydrated with ethanol and xylene. After embedding in paraffin, specimens were cut into 5 μm thickness. Each slide was stained using Hematoxylin and Eosin solution, Masson’s trichrome staining solution and Periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) solution, respectively, according to the manufacture’s instruction. Histopathological changes were examined using the Leica Application Suite (LAS; Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA). The thickness of epithelium and blue-stained collagen deposition was determined using an Image J computerized densitometry system. The number of goblet cells was measured in the entire fields of slide for each sample (
