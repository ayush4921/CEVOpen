<p>The JAK1 and JAK2 were phosphorylated by stimulating PM
 <sub>10</sub> in A549 cells. Increase rates of JAK1 and JAK2 by PM
 <sub>10</sub> exposure were 2.0 and 4.4 times compared to non-treated cells. The phosphorylation of JAK2 was significantly decreased in the 10

 <italic>v</italic> %) of MEO-treated cells by 34.0%, 37.7% and 76.4%, respectively, compared to the only PM
 <sub>10</sub>-treated cells. However, the phosphorylated JAK1 was not altered by MEO treatment at all concentrations compared to PM
 <sub>10</sub>-treated cells (

 <sub>10</sub> incubation resulted in STAT3 phosphorylation by 1.4 times compared to non-treated cells. The treatment of MEO in the 10
