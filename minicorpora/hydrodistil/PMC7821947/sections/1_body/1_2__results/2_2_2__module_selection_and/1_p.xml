<p>Among the modules, M2 is cytokine窶田ytokine receptor interaction, which is closely related to the targets affecting asthma. With 10 targets of M2 including IL2, IL4, IFNA1, IL13, CSF2, IL6, IL5, IL10, CSF1, and GUCA2A, we conducted pathway analysis, which was visualized as bar graph, table and clustergram sorted by 
 <italic>p</italic> value. We found that the first cluster of M2 was cytokine窶田ytokine receptor interaction and the second that was JAK-STAT signaling pathway (

 <xref rid="pharmaceuticals-14-00002-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). For Cytokine窶田ytokine receptor interaction, CSF1, CSF2, IFNA1, IL-10, IL-13, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-6 were related. For JAK-STAT signaling pathway, targets for cytokine窶田ytokine receptor interaction except CSF1 were related (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceuticals-14-00002-f002">Figure 2</xref>B). For this, we could find that the target of M2 affecting asthma were cytokine activation and JAK-STAT signaling pathway among the targets of MEO.
