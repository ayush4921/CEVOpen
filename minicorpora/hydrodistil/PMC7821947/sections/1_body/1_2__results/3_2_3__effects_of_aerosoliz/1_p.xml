<p>The thickness of epithelial cells in the lung tissues of the PM
 <sub>10</sub> group was 2.3 times higher than that of the control (CTR) group. The administration of dexamethasone (DEX) to the PM
 <sub>10</sub>-challanged mice significantly reduced the thickness of epithelium of lung. Airway wall thickening by PM10 exposure was attenuated by MEO treatment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceuticals-14-00002-f003">Figure 3</xref>A). There were 35.3% and 50.3% decreases in epithelial thickness in DEX and MEO-aerosolized mice, respectively, compared to PM
 <sub>10</sub>-exposed mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceuticals-14-00002-f003">Figure 3</xref>D). Collagen deposition was increased in the lungs of the PM
 <sub>10</sub> group than in the CTR group. Nebulizing with DEX and MEO exhibited reduction of blue-stained collagen area in lung tissues (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceuticals-14-00002-f003">Figure 3</xref>B). While DEX treatment showed 64.7% decrease of collagen deposition, treatment of MEO by nebulizing in PM
 <sub>10</sub>-exposed mice significantly attenuated that by 46.3% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceuticals-14-00002-f003">Figure 3</xref>E). In addition, the number of goblet cells was 5 times elevated in the lungs of the PM
 <sub>10</sub> group than in the CTR group, which was reduced by administration of DEX. We observed that increased goblet cells were markedly suppressed by MEO aerosolization (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceuticals-14-00002-f003">Figure 3</xref>C). The reduction rate of MEO on goblet cells area/ppm was 67.8% (
