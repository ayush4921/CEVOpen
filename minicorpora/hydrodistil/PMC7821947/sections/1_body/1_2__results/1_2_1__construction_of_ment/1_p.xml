<p>There are 100 co-efficient genes and 86 co-efficient genes for menthol and menthone, respectively through PubChem system. In total, 186 genes were yielded to be the targets of MEO. In the process of Protein–Protein Interactions (PPI) construction through Genemania, 186 targets were sorted to 108 targets with the score ≥0.7, and 20 targets were added, which mainly related to the 108 targets. Total 128 targets were used to create the network of menthol and menthone, which are two main components of MEO (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-pharmaceuticals-14-00002">Table S1</xref>). With the 128 targets of MEO, we performed a protein interaction network, showing interconnectivity either by reported co-expression, co-localization, physical interactions, shared protein domains, predicted, genetic interactions and pathways. The edges showed different correlations between nodes. Through complex interactions involving co-expression, co-localization, physical interactions, shared protein domains, predicted, genetic interactions and pathways, protein interaction network established a total 128 nodes and 1103 edges (

Based on this network, functional modules of menthol and menthone were explored by MCODE. 128 targets of MEO were divided into 7 modules including M1, Mineral absorption; M2, Cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction; M3, Retinol metabolism; M4, Other glycan degradation; M5, Legionellosis; M6, Th1, and Th2 cell differentiation; M7, Neuroactive ligand–receptor interaction as represented by KEGG pathway 2019 Human (

 <italic>p</italic> value. The most significant term within a module was selected as the one representing the module (
