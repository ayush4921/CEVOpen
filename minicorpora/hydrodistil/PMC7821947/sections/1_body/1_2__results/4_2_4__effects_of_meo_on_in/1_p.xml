<p>PM
 <sub>10</sub> exposure to A549 lung cancer cells induced elevation of inflammatory cytokines mRNA levels. Sensitization of PM
 <sub>10</sub> significantly elevated the 4.4-fold level of IL-6 in comparison with the non-treated cells. Increased IL-6 level by PM
 <sub>10</sub> was significantly decreased by 68.5% in 10
 <sup>−3</sup> /mL (

 <italic>v</italic> %) of MEO-treated cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceuticals-14-00002-f004">Figure 4</xref>A). After PM
 <sub>10</sub> exposure for 24 h, mRNA expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α (5.5-fold) and IL-1β (8.8-fold) were increased in A549 lung cancer cells. Treatment of 10
 <sup>−3</sup> /mL (

 <italic>v</italic> %) of MEO significantly reduced the expressions of TNF-α and IL-1β by 81.9% and 85.8%, respectively, in PM
 <sub>10</sub>-exposed cells. Similar effects were shown in the results of IL-5 and IL-8 mRNA expressions. PM
 <sub>10</sub>-induced increase of IL-5 level was reduced by 10
 <sup>−3</sup> /mL (
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic> %) of MEO treatment. Moreover, there were about 58.9% and 70.4% decreases of IL-8 expressions in MEO 10

 <italic>v</italic> %)-treated cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceuticals-14-00002-f004">Figure 4</xref>B). In addition, Th2-specific cytokines, IL-4 and IL-13, were elevated 4.4 and 6.1 times by PM
 <sub>10</sub> sensitization compared to non-treated cells. The mRNA level of IL-4 in MEO 10
 <sup>−4</sup> /mL (
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic> %)-treated cells was lower than only PM
 <sub>10</sub>-exposed cells. IL-13 expressions were significantly altered by both 10
 <sup>−4</sup> and 10
 <sup>−3</sup> /mL (
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic> %) of MEO-treated cells (
