<p>PM
 <sub>10</sub>-treated A549 cells exhibited the increase of NF-κB levels in nucleus as well as phosphorylation of IκB-α in cytosol compared to non-treated cells. Increase rates of nucleic NF-κB and phosphorylated IκB-α compared with non-treated cells were 1.8 and 3.0 times. Whereas the expression of NF-κB in cytosol was markedly decreased under exposure of PM
 <sub>10</sub> by about 70%. Treatment with 10
 <sup>−3</sup> /mL (
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic> %) of MEO significantly down-regulated the NF-κB levels by 41.1% in nucleus, while up-regulated that by 94.4% in cytoplasm. In addition, the phosphorylated IκB-α in cytosol in the MEO-treated cells was 34.4% lower than the only PM
