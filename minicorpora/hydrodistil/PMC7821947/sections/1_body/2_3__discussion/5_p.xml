<p>Given that inflammation and the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway are potential mechanisms associated with PM
 <sub>10</sub>, we hypothesized that inhalation of the essential oil derived from the 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> genus, peppermint oil, could inhibit the epithelial remodeling and inflammation in asthma via regulation of IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway according to the network pharmacological analysis. Our results found that PM
 <sub>10</sub>-induced IL-6 production and JAK2/STAT3 phosphorylation were declined by the MEO treatment, accompanying a decrease in inflammatory responses including cytokines, MMP activation and NF-ÎºB translocation (

 <sub>10</sub> such as epithelial remodeling, collagen deposition, and goblet cell hyperactivation in asthma. These findings provide a potential property of MEO for the respiratory system in response to air pollution exposure. Peppermint oil would help to alleviate asthma by inhibiting the IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 pathway.
