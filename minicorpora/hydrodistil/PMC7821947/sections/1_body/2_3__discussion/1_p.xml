<p>Airway inflammation and remodeling are major features of respiratory diseases in response to air pollution [
 <xref rid="B16-pharmaceuticals-14-00002" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. A number of studies have reported that environmental pollutants negatively cause abnormalities in the respiratory system such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer, because the toxicity of air pollutants inhalation influences the pulmonary epithelium, which has a crucial role in the homeostasis of the lungs [

 <xref rid="B18-pharmaceuticals-14-00002" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Additionally, it is well known that air pollutants exacerbate the damage of pulmonary epithelial cells, leading to airway epithelial remodeling, fibrosis, malignant transformation and pulmonary destruction in asthma [

 <sub>10</sub> induced the airway epithelium of the lung tissues to become thicker than normal epithelial cells. In addition, Massonâ€™s trichrome-stained collagen deposition indicated by blue intensity occurred in the PM
 <sub>10</sub>-affected fibrosis of the lung. Aerosolization of MEO through the nebulizer significantly decreased the thickness of the pulmonary epithelium, and the accumulation of airway collagen in the OVA and PM
 <sub>10</sub>-exposed lung tissues. Furthermore, there is a significant correlation between exposure to air pollution and the proportion of goblet cells [

Quantification of functional changes in the airway collagen content and goblet cell population as confirmed by airway reactivity to PM challenge showed MEO may contribute to the homeostasis of the lungs, implicating the potential of MEO inhalation as a therapeutic for PM
 <sub>10</sub>-affected asthma.
