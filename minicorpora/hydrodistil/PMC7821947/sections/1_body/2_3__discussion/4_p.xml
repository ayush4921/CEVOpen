<p>Several cellular mechanisms, including STAT3, are involved in the pathogenesis of PM-exacerbated respiratory diseases. The NF-κB pathway can enhance tumor development and maintain the production of tumor cells [
 <xref rid="B34-pharmaceuticals-14-00002" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. It has been shown that PM treatment of A549 lung cancer cells resulted in the translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus, while IκB-α is phosphorylated, leading to the inactivation of the NF-κB-IκB-α complex. In addition, the activation of STAT3 mediated by IL-6 can bind to the NF-κB p65 subunit, leading to its activation [
 <xref rid="B35-pharmaceuticals-14-00002" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In the present study, cells exposed to PM
 <sub>10</sub> and MEO showed inactivation of the NF-κB-IκB-α complex. MEO regulated the translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus by reducing the phosphorylation of IκB-α simultaneously.
