<p>To clarify the underlying mechanism of MEO on epithelial remodeling and collagen deposition in asthma, a PPI obtained from menthol and menthone as the main components of MEO was constructed based on a network pharmacological analysis. The pathway analysis of the PPI network of MEO revealed that cytokineâ€“cytokine receptor interactions and the JAK-STAT signaling pathway were expected to be related to the improvement of asthma by MEO inhalation. Asthma is a typical disease associated with the immune responses of Th2 cells. The production of inflammatory cytokines and mediators at the early stage triggers allergic sensitization, recruitment of eosinophils and neutrophils, and augmented Th2-specific cytokines release. Especially, IL-6-mediated JAK/STAT3 signaling has been proven to play crucial roles in the airway remodeling of asthma [

Based on the result from the network pharmacological analysis using menthol and menthone of peppermint oil, the roles of IL-6 pro-inflammatory cytokines and JAK/STAT3 activation were explored in the present study. In this study, A549 lung carcinoma cells exposed to PM
 <sub>10</sub> showed increases of IL-6 and phosphorylation of JAK1/JAK2/STAT3 signaling molecules. MEO treatment of PM
 <sub>10</sub>-exposed lung epithelial cells significantly inhibited the expressions of IL-6. In addition, the phosphorylated STAT3 levels mediated by PM
 <sub>10</sub> were markedly decreased in the MEO-treated cells. STAT3 is phosphorylated by JAK family, including JAK1, JAK2, and tyrosine kinases 2 [

 <sub>10</sub>-treated cells. The present study found that MEO treatment affected the phosphorylation of JAK2, rather than phosphorylation of JAK1. Taken together, those results suggest that MEO could inhibit the IL-6-mediated JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway in PM
 <sub>10</sub>-induced airway remodeling.
