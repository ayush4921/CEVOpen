<p>Th2 cells are known to be major orchestrators in pathogenesis of asthma [
 <xref rid="B28-pharmaceuticals-14-00002" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The role of STAT3 is well known as an epithelial regulator of the allergic response via recruitment of Th2-specific cytokines [
 <xref rid="B29-pharmaceuticals-14-00002" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. It has been demonstrated that the inflammatory cytokines IL-5 and IL-8 are released in A549 human lung cells after treatment with PM
 <sub>10</sub> [
 <xref rid="B30-pharmaceuticals-14-00002" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Furthermore, Th2-specific IL-4 and IL-13 cytokines were produced by bronchial epithelial cells via STAT3-dependent allergic inflammation in asthma [
 <xref rid="B31-pharmaceuticals-14-00002" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Those inflammatory cytokines have been importantly related to the development of asthma to up-regulate the STAT3 signals [
 <xref rid="B32-pharmaceuticals-14-00002" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. We observed the inhibition of pro-inflammatory TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-5, and IL-8 cytokines in A549 cells treated with MEO and PM
 <sub>10</sub> together compared with PM
 <sub>10</sub> only treated cells. Th2 cell-mediated IL-4 and IL-13 expressions were also reduced after the treatment with MEO and PM
 <sub>10</sub>. Moreover, MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities have been found to participate in the progression of asthma and especially shown to be involved in matrix remodeling and inflammation [
 <xref rid="B33-pharmaceuticals-14-00002" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Based on the previous reports regarding the role of air pollutants on the MMP activity in pulmonary diseases, we investigated the MMP-2 and MMP-9 expressions in PM
 <sub>10</sub>-exposed A549 lung cancer cells. The MEO treatment significantly alleviated the PM
 <sub>10</sub>-induced expressions of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in the A549 cells. Taken together, MEO appears to be effective in regulating the PM-associated airway remodeling by its inhibitory activity on IL-6/JAK2/STAT3-mediated cytokine production.
