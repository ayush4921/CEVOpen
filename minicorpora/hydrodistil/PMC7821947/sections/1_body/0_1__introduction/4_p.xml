<p>In the present study, we conducted a proteinâ€“protein interaction network (PPIN) analysis, an effective pharmacological approach to predict the mechanism of a drug target. Module (M)-network and gene ontology (GO) analysis could offer the molecular mechanism of the anti-asthmatic action of MEO, which is associated with the JAK/STAT pathway. Then, we verified the inhibitory effects of MEO on allergic asthma under the condition of PM
 <sub>10</sub> exposure by verifying the inhibition of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway and its series Th2-specific cytokine production in vivo and in vitro levels.
