<p>Diverse potential molecular mechanisms have been suggested to clarify the relationship of air pollution exposure with allergic sensitization and asthma exacerbation such as oxidative stress, DNA damage, micronucleus formation, and stimulation of pro-inflammatory factors. Asthma is generally thought to be T helper (Th)-2 pathway-mediated inflammatory disease, which is also triggered by environmental PM [
