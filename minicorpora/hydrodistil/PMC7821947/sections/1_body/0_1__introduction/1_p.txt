0: Asthma is one of the major allergic respiratory diseases with various symptoms including wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and/or coughing, which are induced by airway hyperresponsiveness and pulmonary inflammation, and remodeling [ 1].
1: Fine particulate matter (PM) consisting of solid and liquid particles such as black carbon, metals, nitrate, sulfate, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and automobile exhaust particles have recently been reported to exacerbate respiratory diseases such as asthma, rhinitis, bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and hospital admissions as an allergen and, furthermore, are carcinogenic to humans, especially in the lungs [ 2].
2: Pollutants such as respirable particulate matter PM 10, fine particulate matter PM 2.5, NO 2, SO 2, and O 3, can possibly invade the airways entering the alveolar tissue, which is an important risk factor in the management of asthmatic patients as it lowers their quality of life [ 3].
