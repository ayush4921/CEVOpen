0: Diverse potential molecular mechanisms have been suggested to clarify the relationship of air pollution exposure with allergic sensitization and asthma exacerbation such as oxidative stress, DNA damage, micronucleus formation, and stimulation of pro-inflammatory factors.
1: Asthma is generally thought to be T helper (Th)-2 pathway-mediated inflammatory disease, which is also triggered by environmental PM [ 4].
2: Glencross et al.
3: have suggested that pro-inflammatory cytokines, especially IL-6, are clinically relevant to particulate in the rodent model and humans [ 5].
4: A number of studies showed IL-6 leads to the activation of the Janus kinase (JAK) family, and then mediates the phosphorylation of the major transcriptional factor signal transducer and transcription 3 (STAT3) [ 6].
5: The STAT3 transcription factor is proposed to be one of the initial activators of Th2 cell program in allergic lung inflammation [ 7].
6: Additional research has reported that atmospheric diesel exhaust particulate exposure induces the activation of STAT3 in primary cultures of human airway epithelial cells [ 8].
7: Moreover, there is an investigation to find the effects of PM 2.5 on JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway in human bronchial epithelial cells [ 9], giving the possibility of a therapeutic target for asthma by inhibiting the JAK/STAT signaling pathway under an air pollution-exposed condition.
