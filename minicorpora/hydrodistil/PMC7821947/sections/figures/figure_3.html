 <caption> Histological changes of lung tissues stained by Hematoxylin and Eosin ( A), Masson’s trichrome ( B) and Periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) ( C) in ovalbumin (OVA) and PM 10-exposed mice. Thickness of respiratory epithelium ( D), collagen deposition % of area ( E) and goblet cell number per area ( F) were shown as relative quantified values. The slides of each mice ( n = 7) were evaluated by randomly selecting 3 photographs and a total 21 images were quantified using Image J computerized densitometry system. Results are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean. ### p &lt; 0.001 vs. CTR group; * p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01 and *** p &lt; 0.001 vs. PM 10 group. </caption>
