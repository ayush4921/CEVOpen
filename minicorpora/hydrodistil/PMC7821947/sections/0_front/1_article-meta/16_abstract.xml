 <p>Fine particulate matter (PM) exposure exhibits a crucial risk factor to exacerbate airway epithelial remodeling, fibrosis, and pulmonary destruction in asthma. Based on the use of essential oils from aromatic plants on pain relief and anti-inflammatory properties, we investigated the inhibitory effects of essential oil derived from the Mentha species (MEO) against asthma exposed to PM10. The MEO (0.1

To define the mode of action of the MEO on asthma, a protein–protein interaction network was constructed using menthol and menthone as the major components of the MEO. Cytokine expression and the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway were analyzed in lung epithelial A549 cells co-treated with MEO and PM10. Inhalation of MEO by nebulization inhibited respiratory epithelium hyperplasia, collagen deposition, and goblet cell activation in asthmatic mice. Through a network pharmacological analysis, cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction and JAK/STAT was expected to be underlying mechanisms of MEO on asthma. Treatment with MEO significantly reduced the IL-6 levels with a decrease in pro-inflammatory and T helper 2-specific cytokines. PM10-induced phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3 was significantly decreased by MEO. Collectively, MEO may have an inhibitory effect on asthma under the condition of PM10 exposure through the IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway.
