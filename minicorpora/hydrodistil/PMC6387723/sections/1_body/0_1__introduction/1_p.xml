<p>Essential oils (EO) have been used for years in pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and food products due to their health benefits [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], as antimicrobials [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], antidiabetics [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], analgesics [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], antioxidants [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], anti-inflammatories [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and sedatives and anxiolytics [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. EO are complex mixtures of volatile compounds that contain about 20 to 60 components at different concentrations. In general, it has been found that the main components could determine the biological properties of EO in living beings [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In this sense, it has been reported that the EO of 
 <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> (EO-
 <italic>R. officinalis</italic>) has antioxidant [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], antimicrobial [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], anti-inflammatory, and antinociceptive [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] properties, mainly due to the presence of monoterpenes such as 1,8-cineol, camphor, and 
 <italic>Î±</italic>-pinene [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Similarly, the EO of 
 <italic>Lavandula dentata</italic> (EO-
 <italic>L. dentata</italic>), belonging to the same family 
 <italic>Lamiaceae</italic>, have been widely used because of their pharmacological effects as an anticonvulsant and antidepressant [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], sedative [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and antioxidant [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. These biological activities are attributed to the presence of monoterpenes such as linalool, camphor, and 1,8-cineol [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].
