<p>However, EO are highly volatile and can decompose easily due to direct exposure to heat, moisture, light, or oxygen [

In this study, Eudragit EPO was used as the NC-formed polymer due to its cationic nature which will allow a greater interaction with the skin, as a result of the electrostatic interaction [
