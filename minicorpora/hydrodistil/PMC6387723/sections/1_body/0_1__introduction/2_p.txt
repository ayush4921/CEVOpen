0: However, EO are highly volatile and can decompose easily due to direct exposure to heat, moisture, light, or oxygen [ 18].
1: Nanoencapsulation represents a feasible and efficient alternative to overcome these drawbacks since it would provide stability to the active substance [ 19], protection against oxidation [ 20], retention of volatile compounds, and reduction of side effects [ 20,  21].
2: In recent years, there has been growing interest in the development of polymeric nanoparticles, particularly nanocapsules (NC), as systems for the administration of lipophilic bioactive components [ 22], representing a new form of topical administration of EO with a preventive and/or therapeutic antioxidant effect.
3: In this study, Eudragit EPO was used as the NC-formed polymer due to its cationic nature which will allow a greater interaction with the skin, as a result of the electrostatic interaction [ 23].
