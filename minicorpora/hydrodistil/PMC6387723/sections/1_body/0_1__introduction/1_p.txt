0: Essential oils (EO) have been used for years in pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and food products due to their health benefits [ 1], as antimicrobials [ 2], antidiabetics [ 3], analgesics [ 4], antioxidants [ 5], anti-inflammatories [ 6], and sedatives and anxiolytics [ 7].
1: EO are complex mixtures of volatile compounds that contain about 20 to 60 components at different concentrations.
2: In general, it has been found that the main components could determine the biological properties of EO in living beings [ 1,  8].
3: In this sense, it has been reported that the EO of  Rosmarinus officinalis (EO- R. officinalis) has antioxidant [ 9,  10], antimicrobial [ 11], anti-inflammatory, and antinociceptive [ 12,  13] properties, mainly due to the presence of monoterpenes such as 1,8-cineol, camphor, and  -pinene [ 9].
4: Similarly, the EO of  Lavandula dentata (EO- L. dentata), belonging to the same family  Lamiaceae, have been widely used because of their pharmacological effects as an anticonvulsant and antidepressant [ 14], sedative [ 15], and antioxidant [ 16].
5: These biological activities are attributed to the presence of monoterpenes such as linalool, camphor, and 1,8-cineol [ 17].
