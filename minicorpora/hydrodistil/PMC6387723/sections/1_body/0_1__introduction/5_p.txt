0: Gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector (GC-FID) represents an analytical technique suitable for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of EO since it offers high sensitivity, great stability, and an exceptionally high linear dynamic range that allows the analysis of volatile components of the EO at very low concentrations or at trace levels [ 29,  30].
1: To date, there is no analytical method validated by GC-FID by direct injection whose applicability is the simultaneous and quick quantification of essential oil components in polymeric NC.
