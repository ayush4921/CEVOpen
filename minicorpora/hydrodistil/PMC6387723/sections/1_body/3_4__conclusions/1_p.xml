<p>In this study, the chemical compositions of the essential oils from leaves of 
 <italic>R. officinalis</italic> and 
 <italic>L. dentata</italic> were determined. 
 <italic>Î²</italic>-pinene, 1,8-cineole, and camphor were identified as the main components of the two essential oils. In this study, the validated analytical method allowed the simultaneous quantification of two main components of each nanoencapsulated essential oil, allowing the direct monitoring of these components in biological tests 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Hence, it is of great importance, due to the lack of analytical methods by direct GC-FID, to analyze these nanoencapsulated essential oils reported in the literature.
