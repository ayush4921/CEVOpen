<p>The nanoprecipitation technique described by Fessi et al. [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] was used for EO-loaded NC preparation. Previously, it had been established that the ideal size in a biological system having loaded NC is about 200 nm [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The size of each EO-loaded NC was greater than 200 nm with homogeneous distribution and stability during 8 weeks at 25 ± 2°C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). A percentage of encapsulation loading and efficiency are shown in 
 <xref rid="tab4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. Specifically, a %EE of 59.03% for 1,8-cineol and camphor content in total 
 <italic>R. officinalis</italic> essential oil and 41.15% for 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene and 1,8-cineol in total 
 <italic>L. dentata</italic> essential oil were obtained, indicating that at least 59.03% and 41.15% of the 
 <italic>R. officinalis</italic> and 
 <italic>L. dentata</italic> essential oils, respectively, were encapsulated during the preparation of the NC. These results were lower than those reported with NC of 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> ssp and 
 <italic>Thymus capitatus</italic> essential oils (96 ± 4% and 91 ± 1%, respectively) [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The results revealed that the 
 <italic>in situ</italic> properties of the NC-polymer determine the %EE of essential oil components. For example, Lugo-Estrada et al. used a headspace solid-phase microextraction GC-FID method to demonstrate that the %EE of 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> essential oil in NC of 
 <italic>ε</italic>-polycaprolactone was close to 96% [
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].
