0: The nanoprecipitation technique described by Fessi et al.
1: [ 33] was used for EO-loaded NC preparation.
2: Previously, it had been established that the ideal size in a biological system having loaded NC is about 200 nm [ 43].
3: The size of each EO-loaded NC was greater than 200 nm with homogeneous distribution and stability during 8 weeks at 25  2C ( Figure 2).
4: A percentage of encapsulation loading and efficiency are shown in  Table 4.
5: Specifically, a %EE of 59.03% for 1,8-cineol and camphor content in total  R. officinalis essential oil and 41.15% for  -pinene and 1,8-cineol in total  L. dentata essential oil were obtained, indicating that at least 59.03% and 41.15% of the  R. officinalis and  L. dentata essential oils, respectively, were encapsulated during the preparation of the NC.
6: These results were lower than those reported with NC of  Origanum vulgare ssp and  Thymus capitatus essential oils (96  4% and 91  1%, respectively) [ 44].
7: The results revealed that the  in situ properties of the NC-polymer determine the %EE of essential oil components.
8: For example, Lugo-Estrada et al.
9: used a headspace solid-phase microextraction GC-FID method to demonstrate that the %EE of  Thymus vulgaris essential oil in NC of  -polycaprolactone was close to 96% [ 45].
