0: Finally, a number a studies employing UV-VIS spectroscopy have been conducted to investigate encapsulation efficiency and loading capacity of EO-NC.
1: A disadvantage of these UV techniques is that they generate an overlap of essential oil components signal, which may obtain an overestimation, and the UV-vis methods used have not been previously validated.
