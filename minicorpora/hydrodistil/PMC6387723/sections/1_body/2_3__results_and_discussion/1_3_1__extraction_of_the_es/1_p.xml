<p>In the present study, the EO were obtained by hydrodistillation with a yield percentage of 0.72 ± 0.19% (w/w) and 0.53 ± 0.29% (w/w) for 
 <italic>R. officinalis</italic> and 
 <italic>L. dentata</italic>, respectively. The yield of EO as well as their variations according to the origin of the plant has been reported in different investigations [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The yield obtained for the 
 <italic>R. officinalis</italic> essential oil was higher than that reported by Bekkara et al., with a yield of 0.8% for the plant from Algeria [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], while the yield of lavender EO was lower than that reported by Imelouane et al., with a yield of 1.41% for 
 <italic>L. dentata</italic> from Morocco [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This variability may be due to different collection times and/or climatic conditions at the plant-collection sites [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. For example, Zaouali et al. affirmed that variations in the yield from different varieties of 
 <italic>Rosmarinus</italic> EO from Tunisia could be attributed to variations in climatic conditions [
