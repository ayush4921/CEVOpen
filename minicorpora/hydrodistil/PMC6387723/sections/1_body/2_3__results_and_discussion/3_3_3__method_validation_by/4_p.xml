<p>Accuracy was determined by analyzing five concentrations of the standard solution using a standard addition technique. A percentage recovery close to 100% indicates high accuracy of the analytical method. Miao et al. established an analytical method for quantitative analysis and chemical fingerprinting of volatile oils from 
 <italic>Alpinia oxyphylla</italic>. They also established that the validated GC-FID method showed a good recovery with recovery percentages close to 100% [
