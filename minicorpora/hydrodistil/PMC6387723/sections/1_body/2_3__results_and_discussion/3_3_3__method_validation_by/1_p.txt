0: The validation of the method for the quantification of the two main components in EO was performed to know the linearity, precision, and accuracy of the chromatographic method for the quantification of the peak components of EO-loaded NC.
1: The chromatographic conditions and performance parameters were adjusted to provide a simple analysis with the best peak resolution, reducing run time and lowering the cost of validation and analysis of essential oils.
