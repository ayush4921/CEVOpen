<p>The results obtained for the LOD and LOQ were between 0.48 and 1.89

 <sup>−1</sup> for EO-

 <italic>-L. dentata</italic>, respectively (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). These results can be compared with those obtained by Fancello et al. for the components of 
 <italic>Citrus</italic> limon var. pompia leaf essential oil. They calculated and obtained the limits of detection and quantification in a concentration range 50 to 150 
 <italic>µ</italic>g·mL
 <sup>−1</sup> and 100 to 300 
 <italic>µ</italic>g·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively [
