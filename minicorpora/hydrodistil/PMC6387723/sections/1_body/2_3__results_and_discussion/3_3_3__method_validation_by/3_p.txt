0: The results obtained for the LOD and LOQ were between 0.48 and 1.89  gmL 1 and 0.15 and 3.88  gmL 1 for EO- R. officinalis and EO -L. dentata, respectively ( Table 2).
1: These results can be compared with those obtained by Fancello et al.
2: for the components of  Citrus limon var.
3: pompia leaf essential oil.
4: They calculated and obtained the limits of detection and quantification in a concentration range 50 to 150  gmL 1 and 100 to 300  gmL 1, respectively [ 41].
5: In comparison with these results, the values obtained in this work make it possible to guarantee that the method is capable of detecting trace amounts, either in free or encapsulated essential oils.
