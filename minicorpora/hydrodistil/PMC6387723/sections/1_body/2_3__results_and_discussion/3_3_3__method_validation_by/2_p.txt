0: The regression equation, the correlation coefficient, LOD, and LOQ of each main component used as standards were established and are shown in  Table 2.
1: The standard curves of each main component were prepared by plotting the response area versus concentration.
2: The acceptance criterion for linearity is given by the correlation coefficient, which must be greater than or equal to 0.99 [ 40].
3: A good linearity response was obtained with the method developed for the two main components of each essential oil used as standards.
4: These values make it possible to ensure that the methods are capable of quantifying the main compounds in the established range.
