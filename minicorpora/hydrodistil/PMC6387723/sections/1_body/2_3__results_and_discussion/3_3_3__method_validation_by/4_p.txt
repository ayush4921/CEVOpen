0: Accuracy was determined by analyzing five concentrations of the standard solution using a standard addition technique.
1: A percentage recovery close to 100% indicates high accuracy of the analytical method.
2: Miao et al.
3: established an analytical method for quantitative analysis and chemical fingerprinting of volatile oils from  Alpinia oxyphylla.
4: They also established that the validated GC-FID method showed a good recovery with recovery percentages close to 100% [ 42].
5: In  Table 3 are shown the values of percentage recovery and SD for accuracy, precision intermediate, and reproducibility of the main components of essential oils in NC.
