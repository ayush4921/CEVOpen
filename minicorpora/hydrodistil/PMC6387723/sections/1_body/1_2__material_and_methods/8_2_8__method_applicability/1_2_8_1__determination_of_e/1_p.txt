0: Once the chromatographic methods were development and validated, the amount of EO- R. officinalis and  L. dentata in the NC was determined indirectly.
1: The NC dispersions were centrifuged at 25,000 rpm at 3C for 2 h (Allegra 64R Centrifuge, Beckman Coulter, USA).
2: The supernatant was removed and the pellet was washed thrice with methanol to ensure the complete solubilization of monoterpenes.
3: Methanol solutions were analyzed by the previously validated GC-FID method in order to quantify the monoterpenes in NC.
4: Finally, the %EL (3) and %EE (4) were derived as follows: (3)EL%=amount  of  EO  addedamount  of  EO  not  encapsulatedtotal  polymer+amount  of  EO  added100,(4)EE%=amount  of  EO  addedamount  of  EO  not  encapsulatedamount  of  EO  added100.
