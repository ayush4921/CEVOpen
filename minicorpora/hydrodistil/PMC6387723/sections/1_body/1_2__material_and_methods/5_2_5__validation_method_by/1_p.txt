0: The quantitative analysis of the main components used as standard solutions and present in nanocapsules (NC) was performed by GC-FID by direct injection using a gas chromatograph Clarus 480 (Perkin Elmer, USA) equipped with a flame ionization detector and an Elite-5 capillary column (30 m  0.32 mm i.d.
1: 0.25  m film thickness; PerkinElmer, USA).
2: For the  R. officinalis essential oil, the oven temperature was held at 60C for 1 min, increased at 10C min 1 to 160C, increased at 20C min 1 to 200C, and finally increased at 15C min 1 to 230C (and held) for 1 min.
3: While for the  L. dentata essential oil, the oven temperature was held at 70C for 1 min, increased at 8C min 1 to 130C (and held) for 1 min, increased at 17C min 1 to 170C, and finally increased at 25C min 1 to 230C.
4: The detector and injector temperatures were 280C and 220C, respectively.
5: The carrier gas was helium (99.99%) at a flow rate of 1.0 mLmin 1.
6: The injection volume was 2  L using the split mode.
