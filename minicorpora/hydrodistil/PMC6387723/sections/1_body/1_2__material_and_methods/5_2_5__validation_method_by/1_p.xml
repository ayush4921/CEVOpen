<p>The quantitative analysis of the main components used as standard solutions and present in nanocapsules (NC) was performed by GC-FID by direct injection using a gas chromatograph Clarus 480 (Perkin Elmer, USA) equipped with a flame ionization detector and an Elite-5 capillary column (30 m × 0.32 mm i.d. 0.25 
 <italic>μ</italic>m film thickness; PerkinElmer, USA). For the 
 <italic>R. officinalis</italic> essential oil, the oven temperature was held at 60°C for 1 min, increased at 10°C min
 <sup>−1</sup> to 160°C, increased at 20°C min
 <sup>−1</sup> to 200°C, and finally increased at 15°C min
 <sup>−1</sup> to 230°C (and held) for 1 min. While for the 
 <italic>L. dentata</italic> essential oil, the oven temperature was held at 70°C for 1 min, increased at 8°C min
 <sup>−1</sup> to 130°C (and held) for 1 min, increased at 17°C min
 <sup>−1</sup> to 170°C, and finally increased at 25°C min
 <sup>−1</sup> to 230°C. The detector and injector temperatures were 280°C and 220°C, respectively. The carrier gas was helium (99.99%) at a flow rate of 1.0 mL·min
 <sup>−1</sup>. The injection volume was 2
