<p>The composition of volatile constituents of the essential oil was analyzed using a gas chromatograph 6890N (Agilent Technologies, USA) equipped with a 5973 INERT mass selective spectrometer (ionization energy 70 eV) and an HP-5MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 
 <italic>µ</italic>m). Helium (99.99%) was the carrier gas at a flow rate of 0.5 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup>. Data acquisition was performed in the scan mode. The ionization source temperature was 230°C, quadrupole temperature was 150°C, and injector temperature was 220°C. The oven temperature was programmed as follows: 35°C for 9 min, increased from 35°C to 150°C at 3°C min
 <sup>−1</sup>, held at 150°C for 10 min, increased to 250°C at 10°C min
 <sup>−1</sup>, increased at 3°C min
 <sup>−1</sup> to 270°C, and held at 270°C for 10 min. The samples were injected as mentioned above. Components were identified by comparing retention indices relative to C8–C20 n-alkanes, and the mass spectra were compared with the mass spectra from the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) library and the reference data [
