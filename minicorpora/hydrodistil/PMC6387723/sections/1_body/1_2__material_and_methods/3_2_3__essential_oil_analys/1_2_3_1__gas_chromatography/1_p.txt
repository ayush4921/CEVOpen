0: The composition of volatile constituents of the essential oil was analyzed using a gas chromatograph 6890N (Agilent Technologies, USA) equipped with a 5973 INERT mass selective spectrometer (ionization energy 70 eV) and an HP-5MS column (30 m  0.25 mm  0.25  m).
1: Helium (99.99%) was the carrier gas at a flow rate of 0.5 mL min 1.
2: Data acquisition was performed in the scan mode.
3: The ionization source temperature was 230C, quadrupole temperature was 150C, and injector temperature was 220C.
4: The oven temperature was programmed as follows: 35C for 9 min, increased from 35C to 150C at 3C min 1, held at 150C for 10 min, increased to 250C at 10C min 1, increased at 3C min 1 to 270C, and held at 270C for 10 min.
5: The samples were injected as mentioned above.
6: Components were identified by comparing retention indices relative to C8C20 n-alkanes, and the mass spectra were compared with the mass spectra from the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) library and the reference data [ 31].
