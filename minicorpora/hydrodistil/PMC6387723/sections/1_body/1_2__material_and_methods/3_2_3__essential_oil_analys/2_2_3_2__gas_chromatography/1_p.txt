0: The GC-FID analysis of the EO was performed with a gas chromatograph Clarus 480 (Perkin Elmer, USA) equipped with a flame ionization detector and an Elite-5 capillary column (30 m  0.25 mm  0.25  m; PerkinElmer, USA).
1: The oven temperature was programmed as mentioned above.
2: The detector and injector temperatures were 280C and 220C, respectively.
3: The carrier gas was helium (99.99%) at a flow rate of 0.5 mL min 1.
4: Essential oil samples (2  L) were injected using the split mode.
5: The percentage composition of EO was calculated using the peak normalization method.
