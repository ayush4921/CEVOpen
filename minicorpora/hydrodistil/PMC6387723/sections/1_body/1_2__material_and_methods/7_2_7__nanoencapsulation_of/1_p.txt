0: EO-loaded NC were prepared according to the nanoprecipitation method developed by Fessi et al.
1: [ 33].
2: The organic phase was prepared by dissolving 450 mg of Eudragit EPO and 225 mg of EO- R. officinalis or EO- L. dentata in 15 mL of organic solvent mixture (acetone:isopropyl alcohol (50 : 50)) under magnetic stirring at room temperature.
3: The organic solution was added to 20 mL of the aqueous phase (Milli-Q water) under moderate magnetic stirring (125 rpm).
4: Finally, the organic solvent mixture was eliminated by dialysis.
5: Briefly, the suspension was transferred to a membrane of regenerated cellulose Spectrum/Por (Spectrum Labs, USA), which was placed in a container with distilled water in agitation at 25C during 2 hours with two changes of water.
6: NC characterization was carried out to determine mean size, zeta potential, and polydispersity index (PDI) by dynamic light scattering (DLS) (Zetasizer Nano ZS 90, Malvern Instruments, UK) at 25C.
7: The stability of NC was determined from the particle size during 8 weeks (25  2C) in terms of means size and the PDI.
