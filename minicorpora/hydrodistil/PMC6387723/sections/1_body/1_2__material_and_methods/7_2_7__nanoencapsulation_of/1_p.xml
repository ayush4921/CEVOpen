<p>EO-loaded NC were prepared according to the nanoprecipitation method developed by Fessi et al. [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The organic phase was prepared by dissolving 450 mg of Eudragit EPO® and 225 mg of EO-
 <italic>R. officinalis</italic> or EO-
 <italic>L. dentata</italic> in 15 mL of organic solvent mixture (acetone:isopropyl alcohol (50 : 50)) under magnetic stirring at room temperature. The organic solution was added to 20 mL of the aqueous phase (Milli-Q water) under moderate magnetic stirring (125 rpm). Finally, the organic solvent mixture was eliminated by dialysis. Briefly, the suspension was transferred to a membrane of regenerated cellulose Spectrum/Por (Spectrum Labs, USA), which was placed in a container with distilled water in agitation at 25°C during 2 hours with two changes of water. NC characterization was carried out to determine mean size, zeta potential, and polydispersity index (PDI) by dynamic light scattering (DLS) (Zetasizer Nano ZS 90, Malvern Instruments, UK) at 25°C. The stability of NC was determined from the particle size during 8 weeks (25 ± 2°C) in terms of means size and the PDI.
