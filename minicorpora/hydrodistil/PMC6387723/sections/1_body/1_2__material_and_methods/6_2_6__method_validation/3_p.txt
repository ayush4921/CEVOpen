0: The LOD and LOQ were calculated from the calibration curve according to (1)LOD=3.3s,(2)LOQ=10s,where   is the standard deviation of the response and  s is the slope of the calibration curve.
1: The residual standard deviation of the line regression or the standard deviation of  y-intercepts of the line regression may be used as the standard deviation.
