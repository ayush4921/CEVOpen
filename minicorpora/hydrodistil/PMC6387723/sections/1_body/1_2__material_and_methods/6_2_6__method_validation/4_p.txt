0: Accuracy was determined by calculating the recovery percentage using the standard addition method.
1: The determination of the concentration of 1,8-cineol and camphor in the EO- R. officinalis and  -pinene and 1,8-cineol in the EO- L. dentata was performed by analyzing the NC loaded with EO added with five levels of total concentration of standards (range 10160  gmL 1) in triplicates.
2: The average concentration value obtained for each level was compared with the theoretical value, which was considered to be 100%, and the SD was determined.
