<p>Accuracy was determined by calculating the recovery percentage using the standard addition method. The determination of the concentration of 1,8-cineol and camphor in the EO-
 <italic>R. officinalis</italic> and 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene and 1,8-cineol in the EO-
 <italic>L. dentata</italic> was performed by analyzing the NC loaded with EO added with five levels of total concentration of standards (range 10–160 
 <italic>μ</italic>g·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) in triplicates. The average concentration value obtained for each level was compared with the theoretical value, which was considered to be 100%, and the SD was determined.
