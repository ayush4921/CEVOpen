<p>These results are consistent with those of Bousbia et al. [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], Karakaya et al. [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and Moradi et al. [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], which confirm that the contents of oxygenated compounds in the oil obtained by MAH are higher than those of the oil obtained by CH. The largest proportion of oxygenates in MAH extracted essential oils is probably due to the low water content in the system and the speed of the heating process compared with conventional hydrodistillation. Thus, the thermal and hydrolytic degradations of oxygenated compounds are limited [

 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Oxygen compounds have a high dipole moment and will interact more vigorously with microwaves and can be extracted more easily unlike monoterpene hydrocarbons that have a weak dipole moment [
