<p>Several studies have reported that the heat generated by the microwave heating involves a partial pressure gradient of volatile compounds and internal overheating leading to embrittlement or rupture of the cell walls more rapidly and more efficiently [

 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. As a result, the kinetics of the extraction process of essential oils is accelerated, which explains the difference in time between the two extraction methods studied. This can be explained by the rate of heat transfer between the two extraction methods. MAHD utilizes three ways of heat transfer within the sample: irradiation, conduction, and convection, while the heat transfer by HD can occur through conduction and convection only.
