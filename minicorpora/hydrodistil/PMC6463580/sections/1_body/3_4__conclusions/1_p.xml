<p>The essential oils extracted by MAH are quantitatively (yield) and qualitatively (aromatic profile) similar to those obtained by conventional hydrodistillation, although the treatment time has been significantly reduced in the case of MAH (20 min) by relative to CH (180 min). Microwave-assisted hydrodistillation provides an essential oil with higher amounts of oxygenates substantial energy savings, reduced cost, and reduced environmental burden with less CO2 released into the atmosphere. It can be concluded that the MAH method is a good alternative for extracting essential oils of rosemary.</p>
