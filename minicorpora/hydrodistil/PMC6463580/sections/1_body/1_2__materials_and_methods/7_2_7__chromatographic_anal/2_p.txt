0: The GC analysis was performed using a chromatography equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and two capillary columns of different polarities OV type: 101 (25 m x 0.22 mm x 0.25 mm) and Carbowax 20 M (25 m x 0.22 mm x 0.25  m).
1: The carrier gas is helium with a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min and the oven programming temperature is between 50 and 200C with a gradient of 5C/min.
2: CPG/MS coupling was performed on a DB1-type fused silica capillary column (25 m x 0.23 mm x 0.25  m) with helium as a carrier gas and temperature programming identical to that of the GC.
