0: For the extraction of essential oils from rosemary by hydrodistillation under optimal operating conditions, a quantity of 100 g of rosemary was added to 800 ml of distilled water in a 2-liter flask [ 20].
1: The set was placed in a balloon heater attached to a refrigerator to ensure condensation of essential oils for 3 hours.
2: At the end of the distillation, two phases were observed, an aqueous phase (aromatic water) and an organic phase (essential oil), less dense than water.
3: The essential oil was collected, dried under anhydrous sodium sulphate, and stored in sealed vials in the dark, at 4C, until used.
4: Experiments were conducted twice for each condition.
