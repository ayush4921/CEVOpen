0: Rosmarinus officinalis L. essential oil is usually isolated by hydrodistillation, steam distillation, or extraction with organic solvents.
1: These techniques cause the loss of certain volatile compounds due to long extraction times and degradation of unsaturated or esterified compounds by thermal or hydrolytic effect.
2: For example, monoterpenes may be susceptible to chemical changes under stream distillation conditions and even the conventional solvent extraction during removal of solvent by distillation.
3: In addition, many of these methods are time-consuming and energy intensive [ 10,  11].
