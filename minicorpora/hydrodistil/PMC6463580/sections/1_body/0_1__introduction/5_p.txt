0: However, in order to reduce the extraction time and improve the quality of essential oils, new extraction techniques have been developed such as microwave assisted extraction, solvent extraction under pressure, supercritical fluid extraction, and ultrasound-assisted extraction [ 12,  13].
1: Microwave-assisted hydrodistillation has been used for the extraction of laurel essential oils [ 14], lavender [ 15], and thyme [ 16], and rosemary has also been studied [ 17,  18].
2: Faced with all these innovative methods of extraction of essential oils, the choice of the most efficient method is relevant for a better optimization of time, yield, and cost of production.
