0: The present work is therefore a contribution in the global valuation of cumin seeds and from a perspective of sustainable development.
1: A new biorefining approach of cumin seed has been established ( Figure 1).
2: The plant materials were processed in four parts: the vegetable oil, the essential oil, the aromatic water and the final residue (i.e., the cake).
3: The approach adopted consists first of all of extracting the vegetable and essential oils from cumin seeds from different geographical origins.
4: The residual cakes remaining after extractions and the aromatic water (i.e., the by-products) are later valorized as sources of biosourced molecules (antioxidants or antibacterials).
5: In this way, the molecules inside the cakes can be extracted and used in a sequential way, thus avoiding the wasting of natural resources.
