0: In this context, the vegetable oil of several seeds of  Apiaceae could be a strong competitor thanks to their richness in petroselinic acid [ 9].
1: Among these species, cumin ( Cuminum cyminum) is a promising source of vegetable and essential oils containing high levels of petroselinic acid and other bioactive molecules [ 10].
2: Essential oil from cumin was found more efficient than commercial insecticides, and it was proposed in innovative green formulations in crop protection against  E. fetida and  H. axyridis [ 11].
3: Several studies have suggested to develop nanoparticles based on cumin extracts for effective antleichmaniose [ 12] and antitumor activities [ 13].
4: Indeed, cuminaldehyde presents antinociceptive, antineuropathic and anti-inflammatory effects [ 14].
5: However, currently, depending on the industrial field of application, only one of these two fractions is valued, the other constituting a waste.
6: A major scientific question remains the possibility of the sequenced extraction of essential and vegetable oils from cumin seeds.
7: Additionally, the establishment of integrated recovery of cakes appears as a way that can participate in a better use of plant potential while allowing the development of new bioproducts of industrial importance.
