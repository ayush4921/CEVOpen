<p>The present work is therefore a contribution in the global valuation of cumin seeds and from a perspective of sustainable development. A new biorefining approach of cumin seed has been established (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-01054-f001">Figure 1</xref>). The plant materials were processed in four parts: the vegetable oil, the essential oil, the aromatic water and the final residue (i.e., the cake). The approach adopted consists first of all of extracting the vegetable and essential oils from cumin seeds from different geographical origins. The residual cakes remaining after extractions and the aromatic water (i.e., the by-products) are later valorized as sources of biosourced molecules (antioxidants or antibacterials). In this way, the molecules inside the cakes can be extracted and used in a sequential way, thus avoiding the wasting of natural resources.
