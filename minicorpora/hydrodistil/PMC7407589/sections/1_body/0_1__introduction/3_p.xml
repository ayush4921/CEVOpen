<p>In this context, the vegetable oil of several seeds of 
 <italic>Apiaceae</italic> could be a strong competitor thanks to their richness in petroselinic acid [

 <italic>Cuminum cyminum</italic>) is a promising source of vegetable and essential oils containing high levels of petroselinic acid and other bioactive molecules [
 <xref rid="B10-biomolecules-10-01054" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Essential oil from cumin was found more efficient than commercial insecticides, and it was proposed in innovative green formulations in crop protection against 
 <italic>E. fetida</italic> and 
 <italic>H. axyridis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B11-biomolecules-10-01054" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Several studies have suggested to develop nanoparticles based on cumin extracts for effective antleichmaniose [
 <xref rid="B12-biomolecules-10-01054" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and antitumor activities [
 <xref rid="B13-biomolecules-10-01054" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Indeed, cuminaldehyde presents antinociceptive, antineuropathic and anti-inflammatory effects [
 <xref rid="B14-biomolecules-10-01054" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, currently, depending on the industrial field of application, only one of these two fractions is valued, the other constituting a waste. A major scientific question remains the possibility of the sequenced extraction of essential and vegetable oils from cumin seeds. Additionally, the establishment of integrated recovery of cakes appears as a way that can participate in a better use of plant potential while allowing the development of new bioproducts of industrial importance.
