<p>Soluble sugars presented a large variation between the four tested origins (

 <xref rid="B66-biomolecules-10-01054" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. These differences may be explained by environmental and/or genetic effects [
 <xref rid="B66-biomolecules-10-01054" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. It has been reported that drought, salinity, low temperatures and floods may increase the concentrations of soluble sugars, while high light irradiance, heavy metals, nutrient scarcity and ozone can decrease these concentrations in seeds. Nevertheless, changes in sugar content do not follow a static pattern and may vary with genotypes and stresses [
