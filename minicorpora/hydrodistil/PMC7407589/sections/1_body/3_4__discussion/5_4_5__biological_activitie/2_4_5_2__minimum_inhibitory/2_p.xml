<p>Interest in plants with antimicrobial properties has been revived because of drug resistance associated with the use of antibiotics. Nowadays, several crude extracts of plants have been studied for their potential antimicrobial activity or for the identification of new antibacterial agents. The antibacterial activity of cumin seeds has been demonstrated against a broad spectrum of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria [

The results in the present study are in agreement with previous studies which showed that ethanol was a better solvent for the extraction of antimicrobial active substances than water [

The absence of the activity of the hydrodistillated cake can be attributed to the dissolution of the active molecules in the essential oil. Several researchers have already reported that essential oils are the main contributors to the antibacterial activity of cumin seeds, thanks to their wealth of bioactive molecules, including cuminaldehyde [
