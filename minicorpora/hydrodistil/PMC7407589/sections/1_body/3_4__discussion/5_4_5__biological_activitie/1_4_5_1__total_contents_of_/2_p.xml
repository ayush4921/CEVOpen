<p>The important values of TPC and TFC in delipidated cakes, especially the one of French origin, can be attributed to the fact that cyclohexane does not lead to efficient extraction of phenolic compounds, due to their high polarity. The main phenolic compounds remain intact in the residue after defatting [
