<p>The antioxidant activity is one of the most important functional activities of cumin that has been noticed in several studies. Many studies have focused on the analysis of the antioxidant activity of extracts and cumin essential oils [

In addition, results obtained by Bettaieb-Rebey et al. indicate that aqueous solvents are the most suitable for the extraction of DPPH free radical scavengers from cumin seeds of several origins [

 <xref rid="B86-biomolecules-10-01054" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>], which proves that phenolic compounds in cumin cakes significantly contribute to their antioxidant capacity.
