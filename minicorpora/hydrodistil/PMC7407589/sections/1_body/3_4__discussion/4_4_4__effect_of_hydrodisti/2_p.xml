<p>Very little information is available in the literature on the residual cakes from cumin seeds. Sowbhagya et al. reported that partially delipidated cumin residues contain 20% proteins and 5% minerals [

The soluble and insoluble dietary fibers constitute the polysaccharides storage of plant cell walls, which cannot be hydrolyzed by human digestive enzymes. The consumption of dietary fibers has attracted much attention, due to their role in preventing cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, colon cancer and obesity. A diet that provides an adequate amount of fibers is usually less energy dense and bulkier, and therefore it can bring a sense of satiety sooner. In addition, the fibers help to eliminate waste and improve the health of the colon. They help to feel full, favoring weight control and regulation of blood sugar levels [
