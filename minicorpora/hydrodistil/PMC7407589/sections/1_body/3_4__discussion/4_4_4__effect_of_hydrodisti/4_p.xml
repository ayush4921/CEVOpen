<p>Moreover, with respect to the biorefinery concept, one other original application of cumin cakes could be the production of binderless fiberboards through hot pressing, with proteins acting as natural binder and fibers as mechanical reinforcement. These boards could possibly be usable as furniture or building materials, with respect to the indoor air quality. In particular, delipidated cakes would be of real interest for such non-food application, due to their higher protein and fiber contents. Such a valuation has already been highlighted with success using cakes originating from two other

A more recent study also evidenced that no formaldehyde was emitted from these boards, making them much more environmentally friendly materials in comparison with commercial wood-based panels (e.g., OSB, MDF, plywood, and chipboard) [
