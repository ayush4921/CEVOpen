<p>Petroselinic and linoleic acids and the other monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) accounted for more than 60% of total fatty acids whatever the geographic origin (
 <xref rid="biomolecules-10-01054-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Actually, MUFA can reduce cholesterol (LDL), while they could eventually increase the content of high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Petroselinic acid is of potential industrial importance. It can be cleaved by oxidation to produce a mixture of lauric acid, a compound very useful in the production of detergents, and adipic acid, a dicarboxylic acid that can be used in the synthesis of the nylon polymer [

 <xref rid="biomolecules-10-01054-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) in all samples. Linoleic acid is one of the essential fatty acids that are considered as additives in functional foods and nutraceuticals. Numerous studies have documented the significant roles of essential fatty acids in many biochemical pathways that result in a cardioprotective effect. Their considerable effect on reducing the risk of serious diseases such as cancer, osteoporosis, diabetes and others has also been reported [
