 <xref rid="B47-biomolecules-10-01054" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Here, French seeds contained more than 29% oil. This difference may be explained by genotypic or environmental factor [
 <xref rid="B48-biomolecules-10-01054" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Rebey et al. found a significant increase in total lipid content in cumin seeds during maturation (from 8.2% to 16.9%) [
 <xref rid="B49-biomolecules-10-01054" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The vegetable oil yield of cumin seeds can vary from 11.5% to 15.2%, depending on the grinding method used [
 <xref rid="B50-biomolecules-10-01054" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In parallel, the effect of salinity on cumin production resulted in a decrease of oil yield for Tunisian cumin [
 <xref rid="B31-biomolecules-10-01054" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. This diminution is probably due to the decrease of activity of enzymes involved in lipid biosynthesis [
