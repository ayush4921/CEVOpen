<p>Four sterols were identified in cumin seeds of all origins, with the main one which was β-sitosterol, the latter representing 43% to 47% of total sterols depending on the origin (
 <xref rid="biomolecules-10-01054-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). These results are in agreement with those obtained by Zlatanov et al., where 45.6% of β-sitosterol and 39.7% of stigmasterol were found in cumin vegetable oil [

 <sup>5</sup>-avenasterol were also detected in the four samples but at much lower levels, which did not correspond with the results of Ramadan et al. who found 24.3% of Δ5-avenasterol in cumin oil [
