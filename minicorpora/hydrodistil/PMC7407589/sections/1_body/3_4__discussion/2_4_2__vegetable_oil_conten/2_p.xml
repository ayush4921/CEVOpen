<p>The main fatty acids present in cumin seeds were petroselinic and linoleic acids regardless the origin (
 <xref rid="biomolecules-10-01054-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Petroselinic acid is known to be a general characteristic of the seed oils of 
 <italic>Apiaceae</italic> species, representing up to 72.6% in the case of a coriander vegetable oil [

 <xref rid="B51-biomolecules-10-01054" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. In this study, the level of petroselinic acid in the studied cumin vegetable oils are comparable to those found in cumin from Tunisia (55.9%) [

 <xref rid="B49-biomolecules-10-01054" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] found lower rates in Indian varieties (41.4%) and immature cumin seeds (10.6%). Hemavaty and Prabhaker found a much higher content in Indian cumin (83.4%) [
 <xref rid="B45-biomolecules-10-01054" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] than in all other studies. In contrast, salinity reduces petroselinic acid content in Tunisian genotype [
 <xref rid="B38-biomolecules-10-01054" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Salt effect was reported to inhibit the biosynthesis of lipids. This inhibition is mostly due to the decrease of the activities of desaturase enzymes [
