<p>Twenty-five components representing about 97% of the essential oil were identified in the four samples (
 <xref rid="biomolecules-10-01054-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The chemical classes of the oils showed the prevalence of oxygenated monoterpenes (66.5% for the French oil, and up to 66.9% for the Algerian one), represented mainly by cuminaldehyde (43.9% and 49.5%, respectively) and 1,4-p-menthadien-7-al (17.2% and 17.1%, respectively). Monoterpene hydrocarbons constituted the second largest class, β-pinene, p-cymene and γ-terpinene being the major constituents of this class. The fresh and spicy aroma of cumin essential oil was related to γ-terpinene, cuminaldehyde and menthane derivatives.
