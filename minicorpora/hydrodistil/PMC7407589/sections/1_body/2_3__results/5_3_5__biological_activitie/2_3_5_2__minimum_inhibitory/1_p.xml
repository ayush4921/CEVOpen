<p>The MIC and MBC concentrations of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria of the residual cakes originating from the extraction of vegetable and essential oils from French cumin were examined, and the results are summarized in 
 <xref rid="biomolecules-10-01054-t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>. This table also contains the results obtained from the aromatic water. Delipidated cake showed variation in its antimicrobial activity. However, 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> were the most susceptible. Hydrodistillated cake and aromatic water showed no inhibitory or bactericidal effect against the different strains. The applied concentrations were much lower than the MIC and MBC concentrations of the bacteria present.
