<p>The results in 
 <xref rid="biomolecules-10-01054-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref> show the potent antioxidant capacity of all residues, especially those of cumin of French and Syrian origins. Moreover, among the different types of residues studied, aromatic waters have the highest antioxidant activity. Here, the results indicate that different cumin residues have good antioxidant potential, thus appearing as rich and novel sources of natural antioxidants.
