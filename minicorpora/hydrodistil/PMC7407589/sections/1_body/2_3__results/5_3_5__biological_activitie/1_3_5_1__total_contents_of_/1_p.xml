<p>Since phenolic compounds are major factors in the antioxidant activity of plants, the contents of TPC and TFC in cumin cakes and aromatic water (i.e., the remaining water after hydrodistillation) were determined in this study. The results are shown in 
 <xref rid="biomolecules-10-01054-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>. All samples presented high levels of TPC and TFC regardless the geographic origin. However, studied samples differed in the phenol and flavonoid contents. Indeed, the by-products from both French and Syrian cumin showed the highest values. The aromatic waters were the richest in phenols and flavonoids, followed by the delipidated cakes and then the hydrodistillated ones (
