<p>The ADF and NDF fiber contents in the residual cakes of cumin seeds are also presented in 
 <xref rid="biomolecules-10-01054-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. These contents varied considerably between the different cake samples. In particular, those from seeds originating from France were the least rich in NDF and the richest in ADF. This suggests that cakes from seeds of French origin were the poorest in hemicelluloses but also the richest in lignocellulose, especially the delipidated one. Delipidated cakes showed higher values than the hydrodistillated ones. However, all cakes of different varieties can be considered as naturally rich in fibers.
