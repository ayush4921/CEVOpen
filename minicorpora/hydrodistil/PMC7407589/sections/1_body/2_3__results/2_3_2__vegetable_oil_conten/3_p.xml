<p>Nine fatty acids were identified (

For its part, linoleic acid appeared at a much higher retention time. Petroselinic acid (C18: 1n-12) was the most important fatty acid for the four varieties. The seeds of French and Algerian origins showed significantly higher levels (51.5% and 51.6%, respectively) of this specific fatty acid than the two other populations. Linoleic acid was the second most important component identified whatever the origin, followed by oleic acid and then palmitic one (
