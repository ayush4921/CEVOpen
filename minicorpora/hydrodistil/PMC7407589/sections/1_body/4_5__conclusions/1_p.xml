<p>Oil yield and composition of cumin seeds were definitely geographical origin-dependent. Our overall results indicate a good quality of cumin oil that could be used for functional food applications as well as for cosmetic, scented and pharmaceutical applications. Moreover, nutrient contents were significantly affected by the geographical origin of the seeds. The analysis of the biological activity of the cakes shows that the process of delipidation does not affect their antioxidant and antibacterial capacities. However, the bacteria used in the present study were less sensitive to hydrodistillated cake extracts, since the antibacterial activity of seeds is generally due to essential oils, which play a key role in the defense mechanism of seeds against pathogenic bacteria. A comparison of the results leads to the conclusion that the constituents of cumin seed and cake can serve as a nutrient source as well as drugs useful in the chemotherapy of certain infections caused by bacteria, and also as an antioxidant agent. This work suggests potential applications for practical uses of cumin seed extracts and their by-products that could then be implanted as a low-cost renewable source in various industrial areas.</p>
