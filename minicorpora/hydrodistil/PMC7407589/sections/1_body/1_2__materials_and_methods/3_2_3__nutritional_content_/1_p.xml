<p>Moisture and dry matter contents of cumin residues collected after both delipidation and hydrodistillation were determined according to ISO 665:2000 [
 <xref rid="B19-biomolecules-10-01054" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Their mineral and protein contents were assessed according to ISO 749:1977 [
 <xref rid="B20-biomolecules-10-01054" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and ISO 5983-1:2005 [
 <xref rid="B21-biomolecules-10-01054" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], respectively. For protein contents, the conversion factor between total nitrogen and crude protein was chosen equal to 6.25. The anthrone method of Yemm and Willis was used to determine the total soluble sugar content [
