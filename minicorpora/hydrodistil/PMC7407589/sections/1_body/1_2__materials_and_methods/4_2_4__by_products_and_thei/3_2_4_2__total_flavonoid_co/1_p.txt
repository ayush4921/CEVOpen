0: Aluminum chloride assay through colorimetry [ 26] was used to determine TFC of cakes from seeds, and residual water.
1: After 15 min incubation, absorbance was determined using a UV-visible spectrophotometer at 510 nm.
2: A blank sample consisting of distilled water was used.
3: A rutin standard curve was used for quantification, and TFC was expressed in mg of rutin equivalents per gram of extract (mg Ru/g extract).
