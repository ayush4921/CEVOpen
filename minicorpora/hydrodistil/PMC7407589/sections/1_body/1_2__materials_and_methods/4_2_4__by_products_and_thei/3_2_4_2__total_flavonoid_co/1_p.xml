<p>Aluminum chloride assay through colorimetry [
 <xref rid="B26-biomolecules-10-01054" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] was used to determine TFC of cakes from seeds, and residual water. After 15 min incubation, absorbance was determined using a UV-visible spectrophotometer at 510 nm. A blank sample consisting of distilled water was used. A rutin standard curve was used for quantification, and TFC was expressed in mg of rutin equivalents per gram of extract (mg Ru/g extract).
