0: TPC were determined using the Folin-Ciocalteu [ 25] method at 765 nm.
1: For each extract, the determinations were made three times, and TPC was deduced from a calibration curve obtained from standard solutions of gallic acid having a 50500 mg/L concentration range.
2: TPC content was expressed in mg of gallic acid equivalent (GAE) per gram of extract (mg GAE/g extract).
