<p>TPC were determined using the Folin-Ciocalteu [
 <xref rid="B25-biomolecules-10-01054" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] method at 765 nm. For each extract, the determinations were made three times, and TPC was deduced from a calibration curve obtained from standard solutions of gallic acid having a 50â€“500 mg/L concentration range. TPC content was expressed in mg of gallic acid equivalent (GAE) per gram of extract (mg GAE/g extract).
