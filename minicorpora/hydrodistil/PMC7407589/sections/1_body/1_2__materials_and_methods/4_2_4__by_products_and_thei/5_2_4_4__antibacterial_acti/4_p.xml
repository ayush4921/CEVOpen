<p>A microtiter broth dilution method [
 <xref rid="B28-biomolecules-10-01054" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] was used to determine both MIC and MBC concentrations. A 96-well plate (200 μL Per Well) (Corning
 <sup>®</sup> Costar
 <sup>®</sup> 3598; Corning, NW 14831, USA) was used for the preparation in MHB (Mueller Hinton Broth) of serial two-fold dilutions of the different extracts. A positive growth control was also considered in the form of wells with no extract added. For each strain, a diluted bacterial suspension was obtained and adjusted to a 5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> Colony-Forming Units (CFU)/mL final concentration. A negative growth control was also considered in the form of wells with no bacterial inoculum. Duration and temperature of the incubation of plates were 24 h and 37 °C, respectively. MBC was determined by counting the number of colonies after overnight incubation at 37 °C. The MIC and MBC concentrations were determined for all strains. At least three independent determinations were made for each of them.
