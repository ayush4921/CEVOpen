0: A microtiter broth dilution method [ 28] was used to determine both MIC and MBC concentrations.
1: A 96-well plate (200 L Per Well) (Corning  Costar  3598; Corning, NW 14831, USA) was used for the preparation in MHB (Mueller Hinton Broth) of serial two-fold dilutions of the different extracts.
2: A positive growth control was also considered in the form of wells with no extract added.
3: For each strain, a diluted bacterial suspension was obtained and adjusted to a 5  10 5 Colony-Forming Units (CFU)/mL final concentration.
4: A negative growth control was also considered in the form of wells with no bacterial inoculum.
5: Duration and temperature of the incubation of plates were 24 h and 37 C, respectively.
6: MBC was determined by counting the number of colonies after overnight incubation at 37 C. The MIC and MBC concentrations were determined for all strains.
7: At least three independent determinations were made for each of them.
