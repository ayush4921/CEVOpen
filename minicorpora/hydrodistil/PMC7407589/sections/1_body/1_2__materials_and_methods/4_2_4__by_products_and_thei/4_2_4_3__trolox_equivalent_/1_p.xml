<p>A modified method from Brand-Williams et al. [
 <xref rid="B27-biomolecules-10-01054" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] was used to determine the radical scavenging activity against stable DPPH radical using a UV-visible spectrophotometer at 515 nm. All measurements were conducted in triplicate. Calibration was made from Trolox methanol solutions having concentrations situated between 100 and 750 Î¼mol/L.
