0: The saponification of vegetable oil (100 mg test sample mass) was conducted at 75 C and for 20 min by adding 2 mL of a KOH solution, 10% in ethanol.
1: Cholestanol was used as internal standard.
2: Once the mixture was cooled up to the ambient temperature, distilled water (1 mL) and cyclohexane were added (6 mL).
3: After stirring, 160 L of the organic phase were taken and completed with 40 L BSTFA (bis (trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide) and TMCS (trimethylchlorosilane) (99/1,  v/ v).
4: The mixtures were analyzed with a PerkinElmer CPG-FID (Waltham, MA, USA).
5: A CP-SIL 8CB capillary column (30 m length, 0.25 mm internal diameter, and 0.52 m film thickness) and H 2 as the carrier gas (1 mL/min flow rate) were used.
6: The temperature program chosen for the analysis was as follows: the initial oven temperature was held at 160 C for 0.5 min, after which it increased firstly to 260 C at a rate of 20 C/min and maintained at 260 C for 5.5 min, secondly to 300 C at a rate of 2 C/min and maintained at 300 C during 10 min, and lastly to 350 C at a rate of 45 C/min and maintained at 350 C during 3 min.
