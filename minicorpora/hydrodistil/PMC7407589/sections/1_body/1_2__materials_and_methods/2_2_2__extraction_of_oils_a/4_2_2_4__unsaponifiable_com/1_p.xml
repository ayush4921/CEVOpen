<p>The saponification of vegetable oil (100 mg test sample mass) was conducted at 75 °C and for 20 min by adding 2 mL of a KOH solution, 10% in ethanol. Cholestanol was used as internal standard. Once the mixture was cooled up to the ambient temperature, distilled water (1 mL) and cyclohexane were added (6 mL). After stirring, 160 μL of the organic phase were taken and completed with 40 µL BSTFA (bis (trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide) and TMCS (trimethylchlorosilane) (99/1,

 <sub>2</sub> as the carrier gas (1 mL/min flow rate) were used. The temperature program chosen for the analysis was as follows: the initial oven temperature was held at 160 °C for 0.5 min, after which it increased firstly to 260 °C at a rate of 20 °C/min and maintained at 260 °C for 5.5 min, secondly to 300 °C at a rate of 2 °C/min and maintained at 300 °C during 10 min, and lastly to 350 °C at a rate of 45 °C/min and maintained at 350 °C during 3 min.
