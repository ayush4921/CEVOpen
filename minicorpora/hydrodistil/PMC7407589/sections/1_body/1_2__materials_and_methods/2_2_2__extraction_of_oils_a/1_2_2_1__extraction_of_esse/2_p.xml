<p>For essential oil composition determination, a HP 5890 series ∏ GC was used, completed by a 5970-mass spectrometer. Two fused-silica capillary columns were used in this study: a HP-5 MS one, and a Carbowax one, both having the same characteristics (i.e., 30 m length, 0.25 mm internal diameter, and 0.25 μm film thickness). Helium was used as carrier gas at flow rate of 0.6 mL/min.</p>
