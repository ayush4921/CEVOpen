<p>The individual components in both essential oils and volatile extracts were identified by comparing their retention indices (RI) (determined thanks to an n-alkanes series) with those existing in the literature [
 <xref rid="B15-biomolecules-10-01054" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-biomolecules-10-01054" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-biomolecules-10-01054" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="B18-biomolecules-10-01054" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The comparison of their mass spectra with those present in the mass spectra library of data process softwares (NBS75 K database, Wiley 7th NIST 98 EPA/NIH Mass Spectral Library, Mass finder 3/Hochmuth, and FFNSC2/Mondello, 2nd Edition, November 2011) completed the identification, just as their comparison with those also existing in published data. The normalization results of peaks appearing in chromatograms led to the relative percentage of each component in the essential oil.
