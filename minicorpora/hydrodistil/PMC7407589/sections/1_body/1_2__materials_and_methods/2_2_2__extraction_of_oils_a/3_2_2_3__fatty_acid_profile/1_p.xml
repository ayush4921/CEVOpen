<p>The fatty acid profile was determined after dissolution of oil in Methyl-tertbutyl-ether (1 mL added to 20 mg) and conversion into fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) by adding trimethylsulfonium hydroxide (0.2M in methanol) (50 µL). GC/FID was used for analyzing FAME. The capillary column was a CP-Select CB fused silica WCOT one, with following characteristics: 50 m length, 0.25 mm internal diameter, and 0.25 µm film thickness. The temperature program chosen for the analysis was as follows: the initial oven temperature was held at 185 °C for 40 min, after which it increased to 250 °C at a rate of 15 °C/min and maintained at 250 °C for 10.68 min. Both the injector and the detector had the same temperature setting, i.e., 250 °C. The carrier gas used was helium with a flow rate and split ratio of 1.2 mL/min and 1:100, respectively.</p>
