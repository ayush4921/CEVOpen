    "Coriander seeds essential oil is used in food preparation, perfume, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. In this study, extraction of essential oil from coriander seeds was done by hydrodistillation (HD) and microwave assisted hydrodistillation (MAHD) methods. Chemical composition, total phenol contents, antimicrobial and antioxidant properties of essential oils were measured and the results were compared between HD and MAHD methods. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results showed that the essential oils had inhibitory effect on the bacterial membrane and cell wall. Results showed that total phenol contents and antioxidant activity increased under heat and microwave conditions. Coriander seeds essential oil had a very strong effect on <i>Candida albicans</i>. Gram-positive bacteria were more sensitive to the essential oil of coriander seeds than Gram-negative bacteria. The essential oil extracted by MAHD showed better antimicrobial activity, higher phenols yield and antioxidant activity. According to the results of GC-MS, linalool was the most common constituent of both essential oils."
