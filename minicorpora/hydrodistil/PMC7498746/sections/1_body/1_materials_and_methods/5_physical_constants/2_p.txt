0: For both methods, specific gravity, color and refractive index (ATAGO, Rx-5000, Japan) of the essential oils extracted from the coriander seeds were measured according to the method by  Karakaya et al.
1: (2012).
2: Refractive index was measured at 20 C and specific gravity was measured at 25 C.
