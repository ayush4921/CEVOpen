<p id="p0115">Scanning electron microscopy was used to investigate the effect of essential oil on the cell wall of 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>. In order to activate the bacteria, it was incubated in MHB medium for 24 h at 37 °C. Essential oil emulsion was prepared in MIC dilution of bacteria (HD - 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>: 16 mg/ml, HD - 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>: 128 mg/ml and MAHD - 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>: 32 mg/ml, MAHD - 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>: 64 mg/ml) and was added to the microbial suspension at a ratio of 1:1 and for 24 h the other was incubated at 37 °C. 2 ml of the microbial + essential oil suspension was poured into the microtube and centrifuged at 4500 rpm for 5 min. The liquid onto the microtube was removed, and the existing pellet was fixed with the glutaraldehyde (2.5%, v/v, in sodium cacodylate buffer) fixator for 2 h and was cooled at 4 °C. In the next step, the sample was washed three times with sodium cacodylate buffer 0.1 M (pH 7.4), any times for 15 min. Then for dehydration with alcohol, different percentages of alcohol were prepared (30%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 90% and 100%), and each was centrifuged 3 times for 5 min. In the end, a drop of the sample was coated with Sputter Coater (Model SC7620) with palladium-gold for 180 s. The imaging was performed by SEM (LEO 1450vp, Germany) with 205 nm resolution under vacuum and 20 kV voltage conditions at various magnifications (
