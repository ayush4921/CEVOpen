0: Scanning electron microscopy was used to investigate the effect of essential oil on the cell wall of  Staphylococcus aureus and  Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
1: In order to activate the bacteria, it was incubated in MHB medium for 24 h at 37 C. Essential oil emulsion was prepared in MIC dilution of bacteria (HD -  S. aureus: 16 mg/ml, HD -  P. aeruginosa: 128 mg/ml and MAHD -  S. aureus: 32 mg/ml, MAHD -  P. aeruginosa: 64 mg/ml) and was added to the microbial suspension at a ratio of 1:1 and for 24 h the other was incubated at 37 C. 2 ml of the microbial + essential oil suspension was poured into the microtube and centrifuged at 4500 rpm for 5 min.
2: The liquid onto the microtube was removed, and the existing pellet was fixed with the glutaraldehyde (2.5%, v/v, in sodium cacodylate buffer) fixator for 2 h and was cooled at 4 C. In the next step, the sample was washed three times with sodium cacodylate buffer 0.1 M (pH 7.4), any times for 15 min.
3: Then for dehydration with alcohol, different percentages of alcohol were prepared (30%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 90% and 100%), and each was centrifuged 3 times for 5 min.
4: In the end, a drop of the sample was coated with Sputter Coater (Model SC7620) with palladium-gold for 180 s. The imaging was performed by SEM (LEO 1450vp, Germany) with 205 nm resolution under vacuum and 20 kV voltage conditions at various magnifications ( Moghimi et al., 2016).
