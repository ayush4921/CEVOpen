<p id="p0110">Coriander seeds were used as untreated samples treated with MAHD (60 min) and HD (240 min) to investigate the microscopic structure of coriander seeds using SEM. The seeds were placed on a stub and were coated with Sputter Coater (SC7620) with palladium-gold for 180s. Subsequently, the imaging was performed by SEM (LEO 1450vp, Germany) with 205 nm resolution under vacuum and 20 kV voltage conditions at various magnifications (
