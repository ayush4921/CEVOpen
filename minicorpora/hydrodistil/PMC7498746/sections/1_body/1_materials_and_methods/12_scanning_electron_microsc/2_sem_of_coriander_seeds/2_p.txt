0: Coriander seeds were used as untreated samples treated with MAHD (60 min) and HD (240 min) to investigate the microscopic structure of coriander seeds using SEM.
1: The seeds were placed on a stub and were coated with Sputter Coater (SC7620) with palladium-gold for 180s.
2: Subsequently, the imaging was performed by SEM (LEO 1450vp, Germany) with 205 nm resolution under vacuum and 20 kV voltage conditions at various magnifications ( Golmakani and Rezaei, 2008).
