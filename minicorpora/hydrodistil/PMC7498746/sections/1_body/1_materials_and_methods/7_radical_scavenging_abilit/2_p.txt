0: The basis of the radical scavenging method is reduction of DPPH free radical by antioxidants which results in the discoloration of the DPPH methanol solution from purple to yellow.
1: Both essential oils 5 and 10 mg/ml dilutions in methanol as solvent were prepared and BHT (butylated hydroxyl toluene), synthetic antioxidant, was used as positive control.
2: To this end, 1 ml of methanol solution of DPPH (0.5 mM) was added to 4 ml of the dilution which was prepared from the essential oil solution and was placed in a dark place at room temperature for 30 min.
3: The absorbance was then read at 517 nm.
4: Finally, the percentage of DPPH radical scavenging (RSA, %) was calculated as follows  Eq.
5: (2): (2)RSA%=Abscontrol  Abssample Abscontrol100Where, Abs control expresses the absorbance of the control and Abs sample is the absorbance of the sample.
6: To compare the radical scavenging power of the essential oils, IC 50, which represents an effective concentration of the samples with a 50% inhibitory capacity of DPPH was used ( Kukic et al., 2008).
