<p id="p0060">The basis of the radical scavenging method is reduction of DPPH free radical by antioxidants which results in the discoloration of the DPPH methanol solution from purple to yellow. Both essential oils 5 and 10 mg/ml dilutions in methanol as solvent were prepared and BHT (butylated hydroxyl toluene), synthetic antioxidant, was used as positive control. To this end, 1 ml of methanol solution of DPPH (0.5 mM) was added to 4 ml of the dilution which was prepared from the essential oil solution and was placed in a dark place at room temperature for 30 min. The absorbance was then read at 517 nm. Finally, the percentage of DPPH radical scavenging (RSA, %) was calculated as follows
