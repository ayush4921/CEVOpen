<p id="p0055">The amount of total phenolic compounds was measured using Folin–Ciocalteu reagent (FCR). The basis of the work was to reduce the FCR by phenolic compounds in the alkaline medium, and to create a blue complex. In this test dilution of 10 mg/ml was prepared for both essential oils and methanol was used as solvent for essential oils. To determine the amount of total phenolic compounds, 0.5 ml of the essential oil was thoroughly mixed with 2.5 ml of 10% FCR and 2 ml of 7.5% Na2CO3 (w/v), then was placed in a dark place for 30 min. The absorbance of the solution was read using UV-Visible spectrophotometer (UV-160 A, SHIMADZU, Japan) at 765 nm. The standard curve (y = 0.0088x + 0.0412, R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.9976) was plotted in gallic acid (0–0.2 mg/ml). Results were expressed as mg of gallic acid equivalent (GAE) per 100 g dry weight of sample, i.e. mg GAE/100 g (
