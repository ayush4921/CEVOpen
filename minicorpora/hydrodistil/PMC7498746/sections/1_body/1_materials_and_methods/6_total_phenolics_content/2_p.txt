0: The amount of total phenolic compounds was measured using FolinCiocalteu reagent (FCR).
1: The basis of the work was to reduce the FCR by phenolic compounds in the alkaline medium, and to create a blue complex.
2: In this test dilution of 10 mg/ml was prepared for both essential oils and methanol was used as solvent for essential oils.
3: To determine the amount of total phenolic compounds, 0.5 ml of the essential oil was thoroughly mixed with 2.5 ml of 10% FCR and 2 ml of 7.5% Na2CO3 (w/v), then was placed in a dark place for 30 min.
4: The absorbance of the solution was read using UV-Visible spectrophotometer (UV-160 A, SHIMADZU, Japan) at 765 nm.
5: The standard curve (y = 0.0088x + 0.0412, R 2 = 0.9976) was plotted in gallic acid (00.2 mg/ml).
6: Results were expressed as mg of gallic acid equivalent (GAE) per 100 g dry weight of sample, i.e.
7: mg GAE/100 g ( Shaddel et al., 2014).
