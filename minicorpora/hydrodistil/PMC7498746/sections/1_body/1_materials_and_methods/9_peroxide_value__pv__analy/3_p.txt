0: IDF (International Dairy Federation) method is a fast, sensitive, spectrophotometric-colorimetric method used to measure peroxide index ( Hornero-Mendez et al., 2001).
1: Peroxide index was measured at zero time and after fourth and eighth days.
2: For this purpose, the essential oils and synthetic antioxidant BHT (positive control) were diluted (0.2 mg/ml) and added to 2 g of purified soybean oil without antioxidant, and the samples were heated to 60 C. Purified soybean oil without antioxidant was used as negative control.
3: According to the IDF method, we weighed 0.010.3 g of the samples and added 9.8 ml of chloroform-methanol solution (7:3, v/v), and the sample was mixed on a vortex mixer for 24 s. Ammonium thiocyanate solution (50 l) was added and the sample was mixed on a vortex mixer for 24 s, then added 50 l of iron (II) solution and the sample was mixed on a vortex mixer for 24 s. After 5 min incubation at room temperature, the absorbance of the samples and absorption of control sample (containing all compounds except sample) at 500 nm were read.
4: The standard curve (y = 0.0016x + 0.388, R 2 = 0.9626) was obtained using dilutions made of iron (III) chloride solution ( Mehta et al., 2015).
