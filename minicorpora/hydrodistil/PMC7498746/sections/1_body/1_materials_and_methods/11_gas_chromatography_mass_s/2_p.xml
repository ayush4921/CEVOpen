<p id="p0105">Gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (Konik, HRGC 5000c, Spain) was used with quadrature detector and DB-5 capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm stationary phase). The column temperature was increased from 40 °C to 250 °C with the heating rate of 2.5 °C/min. The sample (0.1 μl) was injected to the gas chromatograph, and helium gas was used as carrier gas (with flow rate 1 ml/min). The heating rate was 5 °C/min. In the mass spectrometer, the ionization energy was 70 eV. Alkanes outflows were considered as reference points in the calculation of relative inhibition indices (
