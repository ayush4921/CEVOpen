0: Gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (Konik, HRGC 5000c, Spain) was used with quadrature detector and DB-5 capillary column (30 m  0.25 mm, 0.25 m stationary phase).
1: The column temperature was increased from 40 C to 250 C with the heating rate of 2.5 C/min.
2: The sample (0.1 l) was injected to the gas chromatograph, and helium gas was used as carrier gas (with flow rate 1 ml/min).
3: The heating rate was 5 C/min.
4: In the mass spectrometer, the ionization energy was 70 eV.
5: Alkanes outflows were considered as reference points in the calculation of relative inhibition indices ( Salehi Sourmaghi et al., 2014).
