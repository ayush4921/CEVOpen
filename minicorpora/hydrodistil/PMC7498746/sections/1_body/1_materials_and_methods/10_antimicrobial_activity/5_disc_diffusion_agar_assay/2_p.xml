<p id="p0095">In this test, 15 ml of MHA medium for the bacterium and PDA for the fungai were poured into the plate under sterile conditions and solidified at room temperature. Then, microbial suspension, which was adsorbed to 0.5 McFarland (1.5 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> cfu/ml), was cultured in 10 μl. Sterilized blank disks (6 mm in diameter) were placed in the selected dilutions of essential oils, 150 and 300 mg/ml for 10 min. In this test, vancomycin, gentamicin and amphotericin B (antibiotics) were used as positive control for Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria and fungai, and sterile distilled water and Tween 80, as negative control, respectively. Finally, the bacterial plate was incubated at 37 °C h for 24 h and incubated for fungai at 25 °C for 72 h. The size of the inhibition zone formed in millimeters was reported (
