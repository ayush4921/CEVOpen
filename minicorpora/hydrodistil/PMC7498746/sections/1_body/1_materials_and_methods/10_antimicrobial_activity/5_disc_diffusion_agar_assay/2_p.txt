0: In this test, 15 ml of MHA medium for the bacterium and PDA for the fungai were poured into the plate under sterile conditions and solidified at room temperature.
1: Then, microbial suspension, which was adsorbed to 0.5 McFarland (1.5  10 8 cfu/ml), was cultured in 10 l. Sterilized blank disks (6 mm in diameter) were placed in the selected dilutions of essential oils, 150 and 300 mg/ml for 10 min.
2: In this test, vancomycin, gentamicin and amphotericin B (antibiotics) were used as positive control for Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria and fungai, and sterile distilled water and Tween 80, as negative control, respectively.
3: Finally, the bacterial plate was incubated at 37 C h for 24 h and incubated for fungai at 25 C for 72 h. The size of the inhibition zone formed in millimeters was reported ( Goni et al., 2009).
