0: To determine the minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) and the minimal fungicidal concentration (MFC), 10 l of all wells without microbial growth in the MIC test was placed on MHA medium for bacteria and PDA medium for the fungai was cultured on the surface and incubated under appropriate conditions with microorganisms (37 C for 24 h for bacteria and 25 C for 72 h for fungai).
1: A competition was selected as MBC and MFC with no growth observed ( Silveira et al., 2009;  Moghimi et al., 2016).
