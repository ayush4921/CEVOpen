<p id="p0085">Dilution method was used to obtain the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of essential oil. Sample dilution was performed in a 96 well microplate, filled with mueller hinton broth (MHB) for bacterias and potato dextrose broth (PDB) for fungai. Sample dilutions were prepared from 0.25-128 mg/ml with the aid of 1.5 ml of Tween 80 and culture medium. Dilution was performed by microdilution. In the first well, 150 μl of 128 mg/ml dilution was added, then in all wells (except the first well) 50 μl of the added culture medium was then transferred from the first well 64 mg/ml to the second well, and dilution was corrected. The rest of the dilutions were made the same way. Lastly, 10 μl of microbial suspension (1.5 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> cfu/ml) was added to each well, and the microplate was incubated for the bacteria at 37 °C for 24 h and for the fungai at 25 °C for 72 h. The turbidity was read by spectrophotometer using the Elisa Reader (BioTek, ELx 808, USA) at 630 nm and the lowest turbidity well was reported as MIC (
