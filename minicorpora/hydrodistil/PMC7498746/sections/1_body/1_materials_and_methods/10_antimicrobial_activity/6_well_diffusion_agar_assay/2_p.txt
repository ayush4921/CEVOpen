0: For this purpose, 15 ml of MHA medium for bacteria and PDA for fungai were sterilized on a plate to solidify at room temperature.
1: The wells were cultured with a cork borer of 9 mm diameter and 10 l of microbial suspension equivalent to 0.5 McFarland (1.5  10 8 cfu/ml).
2: 100 l of dilutions of 150 and 300 mg/ml of the essential oil were poured into each well and incubated at 37 C for 24 h and incubated for fungai at 25 C for 72 h. The size of the inhibition zone formed in millimeters was reported ( El-Sayed et al., 2016).
