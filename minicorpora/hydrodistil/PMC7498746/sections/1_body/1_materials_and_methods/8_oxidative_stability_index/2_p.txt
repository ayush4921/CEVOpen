0: The rancimat test measures the secondary and volatile products resulting from the oxidation of oils and fats (including aldehydes, ketones and acids) ( Shahidi and Zhong, 2005).
1: In this test, volatile compounds are trapped in deionized water and increase the conductivity of deionized water.
2: The induction period is actually the time taken to reach the turning point in the conductivity versus time and is defined as OSI.
3: In this test, 0.3 mg/ml dilution of the essential oils in methanol as solvent was prepared and added to 5 g of purified, deodorized and bleached soybean oil without antioxidant.
4: BHT was used as positive control and soybean oil without antioxidant as negative control.
5: The thermal resistance of the specimens was measured using a rancimeter (Metrohm 743, Switzerland) at temperature of 110 C and air flow rate of 1520 L/h ( Issaoui et al., 2010;  Najafi et al., 2015).
