 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Shahidi and Zhong, 2005</xref>). In this test, volatile compounds are trapped in deionized water and increase the conductivity of deionized water. The induction period is actually the time taken to reach the turning point in the conductivity versus time and is defined as OSI. In this test, 0.3 mg/ml dilution of the essential oils in methanol as solvent was prepared and added to 5 g of purified, deodorized and bleached soybean oil without antioxidant. BHT was used as positive control and soybean oil without antioxidant as negative control. The thermal resistance of the specimens was measured using a rancimeter (Metrohm 743, Switzerland) at temperature of 110 °C and air flow rate of 15–20 L/h (
