<p id="p0160">The chemical composition of coriander seeds essential oils are shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. In total, 50 compounds were identified in the essential oil (HD 98.2% and MAHD 98.7%). Most of the compounds identified in HD essential oil were also present in the MAHD essential oil. The dominant compound of both essential oils was linalool in agreement with the results of the studies by 
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Kosar et al. (2005)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Salehi Sourmaghi et al. (2014)</xref>. There was a difference between the relative percentage of linalool in the essential oil of MAHD (52.6%) compared with the HD essential oil (49%). The diversity of the identified compounds was lower in MAHD essential oil, but the relative percent of oxygenated monoterpene in MAHD method (54.8%) was higher than HD essential oil (51.9%). The antioxidant activity of the essential oil has been attributed to the amount of phenolic and terpenoid compounds in the essential oils such as linalool, p-cymene, γ-terpinene, terpin-4-ol, α-pinene, β-pinene and borneol (
