 <sub>50</sub> values for MAHD and HD essential oils were 26.973 and 31.875 mg/ml, respectively. The antioxidant BHT showed a higher radical scavenging activity than that of the coriander seeds essential oil (0.41 mg/ml). As the concentration of essential oil increased, its radical scavenging power increased. The essential oil obtained by MAHD method had higher radical scavenging activity than HD essential oil. This is attributed to the higher total phenolics content of MAHD essential oil compared with HD essential oil. It seems that due to the sensitivity of the antioxidant compounds to the heat and due to the shorter heating time in the MAHD method than the HD method, the MAHD essential oil had a higher radical scavenging ability. Phenolic compounds have an important antioxidant role as a good barrier against oxidative reactions. As shown by many studies, there was a positive correlation between antioxidant activity and phenolics content of natural resources (plants) (
