 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The total phenolic contents of coriander seeds essential oil obtained by MAHD and HD methods were 0.1895 and 0.164 mg GAE/100 g, respectively. It seems that simultaneous application of heat treatment and microwave irradiation in MAHD method compared with heat treatment alone in HD method resulted in higher extraction efficiency of phenolic compounds than classical HD method. This may be due to the more efficient heat flow of the microwave (

 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Chumyam et al., 2013</xref>), and the simultaneous application of heat and microwave wave combined phenolic compounds free form has been attributed to the release of these compounds into the intracellular fluid and to increase their extraction efficiency (
