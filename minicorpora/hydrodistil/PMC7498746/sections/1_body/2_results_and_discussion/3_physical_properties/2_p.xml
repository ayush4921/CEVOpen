<p id="p0130">The results of refractive index, specific gravity and color of essential oil obtained by HD and MAHD are shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. No significant differences were observed between treatments (P &gt; 0.05). The only difference in the color of the MAHD essential oil was compared with the HD treatment, which was completely colorless. 
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Karakaya et al. (2012)</xref> obtained the specific gravity of rosemary essential oil extracted by HD and MAHD methods, 0.875 and 0.879, respectively. The refractive indexes of both essential oils were identical (1.465).
