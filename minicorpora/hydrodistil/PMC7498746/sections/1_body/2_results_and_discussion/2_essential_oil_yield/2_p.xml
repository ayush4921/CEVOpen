Although there was no significant difference between extraction efficiency of HD and MAHD methods (P &gt; 0.05), according to the shorter MAHD extraction process (60 min), higher and more efficient heat flow, indoor extraction process and no energy loss (

 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Ebrahimzadeh et al., 2003</xref>), MAHD was a better method for separation essential oils. For MAHD and HD methods, the extraction was started at the boiling point of water (less than 100 °C). MAHD reached this temperature after 15 min and HD method after 45 min. The energy requirement to perform the distillation based on the maximum power consumption of the electromantle for microwave oven for MAHD and HD were 0.63 and 2.52 kWh, respectively (
