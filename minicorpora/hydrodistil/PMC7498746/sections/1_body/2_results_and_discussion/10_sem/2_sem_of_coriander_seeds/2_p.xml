<p id="p0165">The images of untreated coriander seeds (

 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> B) and MAHD treatment (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> C) are shown together in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>. Coriander seeds images were observed without treatment of completely defined and intact cells and cell walls. Both HD and MAHD treatments altered the appearance and appearance properties of coriander seeds. In the images taken from MAHD treatment compared with untreated coriander seeds and HD treatment, the cell damage was higher. In some parts, the cell wall was ruptured and the structure of cell wall was destroyed. This appears to be caused by a better and more efficient diffusion of heat in the MAHD treatment. In the HD treatment compared with MAHD treatment and untreated coriander seeds, the major changes by HD treatment were in appearance and appearance properties of the seeds.
