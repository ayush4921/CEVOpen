<p id="p0170">Scanning electron microscopy was used to obtain information about on bacterial morphology changes after essential oil treatment compared with 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> untreated. The images in

 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>) have been shown. Untreated bacterial samples with essential oil, rod-shaped 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and spherical-shaped 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> were observed. Significant morphological changes were observed in the treated samples compared with the untreated samples. The images taken of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> under both HD and MAHD treatments showed truncations on the surface of the bacteria. Some of these bacteria were more severely damaged as their cell walls ruptured and the inside content leaked out of the cell. 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> showed a different degree of deformation and degradation. Bacteria were largely destroyed and the integrity of the cell wall and their appearance were almost completely destroyed. Many researchers have reported that the possible mechanisms of the essential oils and their derivatives include cell wall destruction, cytoplasmic membrane damage, damage to membrane proteins, intracellular content leakage, and cytoplasmic coagulation (

 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Swamy et al., 2016</xref>). Based on the analysis of SEM images, it seems that the cell wall and the membrane of pathogenic bacteria are the main targets of the essential oils.
