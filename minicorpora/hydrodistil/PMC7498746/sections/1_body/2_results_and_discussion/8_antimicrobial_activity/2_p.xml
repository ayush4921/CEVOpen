<p id="p0155">The antimicrobial activity of coriander seeds essential oils against four microorganisms causing foodborne infection and poisoning is presented in Tables 
 <xref rid="tbl4a" ref-type="table">4.1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="tbl4b" ref-type="table">4.2</xref>. The essential oil showed good inhibitory effect against all the microorganisms under investigation with different degrees of inhibition. According to the results of MIC, MBC and MFC tests and the comparison between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and fungai under investigation, the highest activity of HD and MAHD essential oils against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, with the lowest MIC values and MBC (MFC) was seen. The highest values of MIC and MBC (MFC) were 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic>, indicating low essential oil activity against these two microorganisms and in fact their resistance to coriander seeds essential oil. The largest inhibition zones in disk diffusion test (disk diameter 6 mm) were obtained for 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, indicating the high susceptibility of these microorganisms to coriander seeds oil. In addition, the smallest inhibition zones, which showed high resistance of the microorganism to the essential oil, were measured for 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>A. niger</italic>. In the well diffusion test (well diameter 9 mm), both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria showed the same sensitivity to essential oil. Although, 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> showed more sensitivity than 
 <italic>A. niger</italic> among the fungai. The analysis of the results indicated that the essential oil of coriander seeds obtained by both MAHD and HD method had a very strong effect on 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> so that in all antimicrobial tests the lowest MIC dilutions and the largest inhibition zones were obtained (p &lt; 0.05). Coriander seeds oil also has more activity against Gram-positive bacteria than Gram-negative bacteria, which is attributed to differences in cell wall structure of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. This was consistent with the research results (

 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Goldbeck et al., 2014</xref>). The outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria has a highly hydrophilic surface that prevents the penetration of hydrophobic compounds (
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Rivera Calo et al., 2015</xref>). However, the lipophilic ends of the lipoteichoic acids of the cell membrane of Gram-positive bacteria facilitates the penetration of hydrophobic compounds such as essential oils, which lead to greater susceptibility to the bacteria (
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Karakaya et al., 2012</xref>). The analysis of Tables 
 <xref rid="tbl4a" ref-type="table">4.1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="tbl4b" ref-type="table">4.2</xref> shows that the essential oil obtained by MAHD method had higher antimicrobial activity compared with HD method. Changes in the antimicrobial activity of the essential oils depend on their different chemical constituents. Therefore, the higher antimicrobial activity of essential oil is attributed to higher levels of linalool and other oxygenated compounds in MAHD (
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Ijaz Hussain et al., 2008</xref>). The major groups responsible for the antimicrobial activities of plants include phenols, phenolic acids, quinones, flavonoids, tannins, coumarines, alkaloids and terpenoids. Changes in the structure and chemical composition of these components lead to differences in the antimicrobial activity of the essential oils (
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Gyawali and Ibrahim, 2014</xref>). The mode of action of essential oils against bacteria is primarily the destruction of the cell wall and cell membrane integrity, which in turn increases membrane permeability and results in disruption of cellular activities such as energy production and membrane transport. Damage to the cell membrane causes changes in critical processes such as nutrient processing, synthesis of structural macromolecules, and growth regulators (
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Swamy et al., 2016</xref>). The antifungal mechanism of the essential oils is similar to bacteria and their main purpose is the cell membrane of the fungi, which leads to increase the membrane permeability and loss its integrity (
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Krisch et al., 2011</xref>). The essential oil breaks down the mitochondrial membranes by penetrating the cytoplasmic membrane. In molds, it affects the growth of hyphae and their sporulation. Inactivation of conidia by essential oil is a key inhibition process because it is difficult to remove conidia due to their heat and chemical constituents (
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Laranjo et al., 2017</xref>).
