<p id="p0145">The oxidative stabilities of the essential oils obtained from MAHD, HD and BHT were measured as 5.345, 5.20 and 6.1 h, respectively. The control sample had the lowest induction time (4.6 h), and the synthetic antioxidant BHT had the highest induction time (6.1 h). Regarding DPPH radical inhibitory power, MAHD essential oil showed higher inhibitory effect than HD essential oil, which was similar to oil oxidative stability (MAHD essential oil was more stable than HD essential oil). The oxidative stability of the essential oil seems to follow the mechanism of free radical inhibition.</p>
