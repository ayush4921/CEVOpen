<p id="p0175">MAHD method is a new and advanced method of essential oils production, which is recognized as a green method due to the lower extraction time, lower energy consumption resulting in lower cost, environmental friendliness, more efficient heat flow and less solvent consumption. Accordingly, the usual extraction methods can be replaced by MAHD method. Although the extraction yield obtained by MAHD and HD methods were approximately similar, the extraction time of MAHD method was significantly shorter than HD method. The investigation of microbial and the antioxidant test data showed better results of essential oil extracted by MAHD method. Coriander seeds essential oil had a higher inhibitory effect against Gram-posetive bacteria than Gram-negative bacteria. SEM images showed the inhibitory effect of coriander seeds essential oil against bacteria on their cell walls.</p>
