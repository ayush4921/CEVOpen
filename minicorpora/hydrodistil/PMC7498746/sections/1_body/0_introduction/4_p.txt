0: The essential oils of plants are usually obtained by water or steam distillation and solvent extraction.
1: Disadvantages of these methods are long extraction time, low efficiency, toxicity of solvents, loss of volatile compounds and decomposition of unsaturated compounds due to heat ( Ebrahimzadeh et al., 2003).
2: Nowadays methods such as microwave, supercritical fluid, ultrasonic and pressure solvent extractions are used to increase extraction efficiency, shorten extraction time, improve the quality of extracted compounds and reduce process costs ( Golmakani and Rezaei, 2008).
3: Microwave assisted hydrodistillation (MAHD) is a new and advanced method for extracting essential oils from plants ( Golmakani and Rezaei, 2008).
4: In this method, the microwave waves are converted to thermal energy, resulting in the heating of the solvent and sample in the microwave oven, and ultimately the extraction process is performed more rapidly.
5: In the MAHD method, heat and warmth are specifically transferred to the test sample and no significant energy loss to the environment.
6: The most important advantages of this method include more efficient heat flow, reduced extraction time, lower solvent utilization, higher quality of extracted products, and more environmentally friendly method ( Nitthiyah et al., 2017).
7: MAHD process, from published studies, successfully used microwaves to extract essential oils from different aromatic plants ( Golmakani and Rezaei, 2008;  Wu Wang et al., 2010;  Karakaya et al., 2012;  Khanavi et al., 2013).
