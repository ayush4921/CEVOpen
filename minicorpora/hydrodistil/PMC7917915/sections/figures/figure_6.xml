  <p>Network pharmacology analysis underlying the theoretical interactions between essential oil phytochemicals, namely α-pinene, myrcene, terpinolene, limonene and leishmanial target proteins. Specifically, the bioinformatics platform showed the prominent position of lanosterol-14α-demethylase (XP_001563021.1), in the scenario of the predicted interactions, namely with α-pinene and limonene. With the only exclusion of XP_001569114.2 (methionine synthase reductase), the other predicted proteins are cytochrome p450-like proteins.</p>
