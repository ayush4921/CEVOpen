<p>Putative targets were predicted using bioinformatics platforms SwissTargetPrediction and STITCH, whereas the components-targets plot was built using the software Cytoscape version 3.8. Docking calculations were conducted through the Autodock Vina of PyRx 0.8 software, as recently described [
 <xref rid="B23-biomolecules-11-00272" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Crystal structures of target proteins were derived from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with PDB IDs as follows: 1GQR [acetylcholinesterase (AChE)], 2P54 [peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α (PPAR-α)], 2HFF [cannabinoid type 2 receptor (CB2)]. Discovery studio 2020 visualizer was employed to investigate the protein-ligand non-bonding interactions.
