0: Putative targets were predicted using bioinformatics platforms SwissTargetPrediction and STITCH, whereas the components-targets plot was built using the software Cytoscape version 3.8.
1: Docking calculations were conducted through the Autodock Vina of PyRx 0.8 software, as recently described [ 23].
2: Crystal structures of target proteins were derived from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with PDB IDs as follows: 1GQR [acetylcholinesterase (AChE)], 2P54 [peroxisome proliferator activated receptor  (PPAR-)], 2HFF [cannabinoid type 2 receptor (CB2)].
3: Discovery studio 2020 visualizer was employed to investigate the protein-ligand non-bonding interactions.
