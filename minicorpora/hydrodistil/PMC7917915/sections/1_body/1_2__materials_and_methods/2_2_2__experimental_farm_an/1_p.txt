0: Three selected cultivars of industrial hemp, namely  Cannabis sativa L. cultivar  Futura 75 (F75),  C. sativa L. cultivar  Eletta campana (EC) and  C. sativa L. cultivar  Carmagnola selezionata (CS) were cultivated in experimental crops, in the Abruzzo region and more specifically in the surrounding of the Pescara river valley, Italy ( Table 1).
1: This valley is a typical piedmont-hilly zone of the central-eastern Apennines, which originates from the ecotone between the Gran Sasso and Maiella-Morrone massifs, in the northern and southern part, respectively and declines within 45 km in an extended drainage basin to the Adriatic coast.
2: The basin area expresses the Mediterranean bi-climate characters typical of the Adriatic coast with dry summer characterized by law rainfall.
3: The total extension of the experimental crops were 24,000 square meters on level ground, with a mean slope lower than 5% and altitude range 70100 m asl.
4: The planting scheme was in lines with a central 2 m irrigation strip widths.
