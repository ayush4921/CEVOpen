0: The volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analysis was carried out using an Agilent Technologies 6850 gas chromatograph (Santa Clara, CA, USA) coupled with an Agilent Technologies 5975 mass spectrometer (Santa Clara, CA, USA), equipped with an HP-5MS capillary column (5% phenyl 95% methylpolysiloxane, 30 m  0.25 mm inner diameter, film thickness 0.25 m; Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA, USA).
1: About 1 L of the filtered oil has been manually injected in the split configuration mode and GC parameters were adjusted as follows: injector temperature, 250 C; flow rate of the helium carrier gas (99.995% purity), 1.0 mL/min.
2: The oven temperature was set at 40 C (5 min), then raised to 200 C at 5 C/min and maintained at this temperature for 60 min.
3: MS parameters were set as follows: energy of electron ionization, 70 eV; solvent delay, 6 min; source temperature, 230 C quadrupole temperature, 150 C; and mass scan was carried out over the 50350  m/ z range.
4: The eluted compounds were identified by matching the relative mass spectra with those available from both a commercial database (FFNSC 3, Chromaleont srl, Messina, Italy) and online libraries (NIST 11, Flavor2, Scientific Instrument Services, Ringoes, NJ, USA).
5: Kovats index (KI) was used as a second parameter to confirm the analyte identification.
6: KIs were measured using a mixture of n-alkanes (C8C24) in the same analytic conditions and then compared with values reported in the literature and in the FFNSC 3 database.
7: The identity of several compounds was confirmed through injection of standard samples available from commercial sources.
8: The relative abundance of oil components was obtained by integrating the GC/MS peak areas without any further correction as previously reported [ 15].
