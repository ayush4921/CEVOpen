0: The animal model was based on male adult BALB/c mice, supplied by National Institute of Health, Islamabad, Pakistan, whereas Animal and Ethics Committee of the University of Lahore, Islamabad approved current study design for experimental purposes.
1: Standard diet was given to BALB/c mice during experimental plan.
2: For sample administration, BALB/c mice were allocated in 3 groups, the 1st group composed of sample control (2.5 mL/kg, corresponding to 12.5 g/mL EO in a final volume of 100 L), the 2nd group had standard drug (positive control: amphotericin B 12.5 mg/kg) and the 3rd group composed of negative control (saline + 0.5% DMSO).
3: Treatments were injected once a day intraperitoneally for 8 weeks.
4: Experimental plan during in vivo study was followed, as previously described [ 12].
5: Regarding the EO dose (2.5 mL/kg), the corresponding concentration (12.5 g/mL in 100 L) was considered not toxic, based on our previous observations of null effect on multiple cell lines treated with comparable EO concentrations [ 9] and according to a study using similar DMSO final concentrations in a cell-based model [ 18].
6: The DMSO amount administered intraperitoneally to mice is 0.5%, which is comparable to the doses used in papers dealing with other essential oils administered in murine models of leishmaniasis [ 19, 20].
7: Additionally, multiple studies showed the intraperitoneal administration of terpene compounds, such as  E-caryophyllene and linalool, at dosages much higher (100200 mg/kg), than those injected in the present paradigm [ 21, 22].
