0: Scavenging/reducing effects were investigated by radical scavenging 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) and reducing power (CUPRAC and FRAP) assays and results were expressed as trolox equivalents (TE).
1: The metal-chelating properties were expressed as ethylenediaminetetraacetic (EDTA) equivalents.
2: Details of the assays were reported in previous studies of ours [ 4, 8].
