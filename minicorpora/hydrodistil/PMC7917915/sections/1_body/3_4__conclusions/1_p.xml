<p>The present findings highlight the potential of essential oils from industrial hemp inflorescences as protective agents, in an in vivo model of tissue wound induced by 
 <italic>L. tropica</italic>, in mice. The chemical analyses provide the fingerprint of these selected cultivars and aim at correlating the biological effects with the metabolites identified. The in silico study also evaluates AChE, CB2 and PPAR-Î± as putative targets mediating the observed protective effects, in mice. Collectively, these data confirm the possibility to use alternative natural compounds in addition to the standard therapy. Considering also recent literature data concerning innovative delivery systems in the anti-leishmanial/anti-oxidant treatment [
