 <italic>Leishmania</italic> is a pathogenic parasite (belong to family Trypanosomatidae) which is responsible for worldwide spread of leishmaniasis. As per World Health Organization (WHO) reports, leishmaniasis effected 350 million people of 98 countries in which 12 million people at high risk. Total of 30 strains of 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic> are discovered, 20 of which are lethal. 
 <italic>L. tropica</italic> is one of the identified species which is major cause of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Africa, Asia and Europe. Pentavalent antimonial is the first line therapy against cutaneous leishmaniasis (as per WHO) but due to severe side effects and high cost of drugs, there is need of New lead compounds for treatment purposes [
 <xref rid="B29-biomolecules-11-00272" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The hemp varieties were also investigated for evaluating their capability in blunting the experimental tissue lesions induced by 
 <italic>L. tropica</italic>, intraperitoneally injected in mice, an in vivo experimental model of visceral leishmaniasis [
 <xref rid="B30-biomolecules-11-00272" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Among the symptoms of visceral leishmaniosis, there are eye lesions, particularly in those forms induced by 
 <italic>L. tropica</italic> [
 <xref rid="B31-biomolecules-11-00272" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Therefore, in the present study the efficacy of the hemp essential oils was monitored in terms of reduced eye lesions at the end of the treatment. As depicted in 
 <xref rid="biomolecules-11-00272-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>, after eight weeks of treatment, all cultivars were effective in reducing the dimension of tissue wound, compared to the negative untreated control group (NC). The efficacy of 
 <italic>Eletta campana</italic> and 
 <italic>Futura 75</italic> was similar to that of amphotericin B, that was chosen as the elective and comparative anti-leishmanial treatment [
 <xref rid="B32-biomolecules-11-00272" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. According to the phytochemical analysis, the higher efficacy of 
 <italic>Eletta campana</italic> and 
 <italic>Futura 75</italic> varieties agrees with their best scavenging/reducing profile, with respect to 
 <italic>Carmagnola selezionata</italic>. This is also consistent, albeit partially, with our previous study showing the higher efficacy of 
 <italic>Futura 75</italic> extract as antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent, compared to 
 <italic>Carmagnola selezionata</italic> [
 <xref rid="B5-biomolecules-11-00272" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Considering the results of GC-MS, a bioinformatics analysis was conducted on the prominent terpene compounds (&gt;1% total terpene fraction) present in the EOs, as well. The analysis was conducted via SwissTargetPrediction platform and indicated the PPAR-α and CB2 receptors as prominent targets, in the components-targets plot (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-11-00272-f002">Figure 2</xref>). The activation of the aforementioned enzyme/receptor could mediate, at least in part, the anti-inflammatory properties of terpene compounds [
 <xref rid="B33-biomolecules-11-00272" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34-biomolecules-11-00272" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The same receptors were also reputed to play a key role in the anti-inflammatory properties induced by cannabidiol, the prominent terpenophenolic compound of industrial hemp [
 <xref rid="B35-biomolecules-11-00272" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="B36-biomolecules-11-00272" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Among the identified terpene compounds, selina-3,7(11)-diene was predicted to interact with the aforementioned enzyme/receptor, with putative affinities in the micromolar range (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-11-00272-f003">Figure 3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-11-00272-f004">Figure 4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-11-00272-f005">Figure 5</xref>). Moreover, it is sensitive to note that the content of selina-3,7(11)-diene was under the 1%, in the 
 <italic>Carmagnola selezionata</italic> cultivar. Therefore, this could influence the slight lower efficacy of 
 <italic>Carmagnola selezionata</italic> EO, as protective agent in albino mice challenged with 
 <italic>L. tropica</italic>. The bioinformatics analysis conducted via SwissTargetPrediction also indicated the prominent position of AChE, that is a classical target of anti-Alzheimer therapy [
 <xref rid="B37-biomolecules-11-00272" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Intriguingly, literature data reported simultaneous anti-cholinesterase and anti-leishmanial effects induced by herbal extracts and natural compounds [
 <xref rid="B38-biomolecules-11-00272" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="B39-biomolecules-11-00272" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. It is well-known that AChE catalyzes the hydrolysis of acetylcholine in choline and acetate. Choline is also the precursor of phosphatidylcholine, a key component of leishmanial membrane [
 <xref rid="B40-biomolecules-11-00272" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In this context, the inhibition of AChE has been hypothesized as a novel mechanism of anti-leishmanial activity [
 <xref rid="B38-biomolecules-11-00272" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. However, a comparative study including as positive controls both anti-cholinesterase and anti-leishmanial drugs, such as galantamine and miltefosine, respectively, is still missing. Nevertheless, the putative interactions between AChE and selina-3,7(11)-diene, that were predicted to occur at micromolar terpene concentration by the employed virtual screening software (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-11-00272-f005">Figure 5</xref>), further strengthens the importance to conduct future research in this field. Finally, the in silico predictions conducted via STITCH platform indicated putative interactions between leishmanial lanosterol-14-α-demethylase and different EO terpenes, namely limonene and α-pinene (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-11-00272-f006">Figure 6</xref>). However, the virtual screening conducted for unravelling the affinity of α-pinene towards lanosterol 14α-demethylase (PDB: 3L4D) rules out a direct effect induced by hemp-deriving terpenes on leishmanial metabolism (putative affinity: Ki &gt; 100 µM).
