<p>To our knowledge the tristimulus colorimetry, employed in this study to evaluate the color properties of hemp essential oils, was not yet reported in the literature, with the only exception of our previous work [
 <xref rid="B9-biomolecules-11-00272" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], in which one essential oil from 
 <italic>Futura 75</italic> and its relative aromatic water were submitted to this evaluation. The three hemp essential oils, slightly yellow colored, were submitted to colorimetric analyses, whose results are shown in 
 <xref rid="biomolecules-11-00272-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> as well the relative reflectance curves reported in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-11-00272-f001">Figure 1</xref>. Substantially, samples showed a high 
 <italic>L</italic>* value, index of their brightness, a less significant yellow parameter 
 <italic>b</italic>* (among 7.82 and 12.82) and confirmed a weak green coloration denoted by the just negative 
 <italic>a</italic>* value. Therefore, a significant difference could be shown for the paler yellow nuance. The experimental data are in accordance with already published colorimetric analysis of 
 <italic>Futura 75</italic> essential oil [
 <xref rid="B9-biomolecules-11-00272" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], with only relevant change in yellow (
 <italic>b</italic>* parameter) that varies from 24.36 in the sample obtained from 2016 to 8.47 in the 2019 sample and highlights the effects of plant variability related to environmental and intrinsic factors.
