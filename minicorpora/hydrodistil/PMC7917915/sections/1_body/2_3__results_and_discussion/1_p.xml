<p>Many factors influence the productive performances of hemp plants in terms of essential oil yield and quality, including environmental conditions, climatic factors and agronomical practices. Furthermore, the selection of raw plant material could be critical, particularly when the distillation is applied as a strategy to valorize byproducts. The secretory glands are mainly concentrated in floral structures and technical manipulation or mechanical processes can significantly affect quantitative and qualitative yield. In this study, the manual collection of mature inflorescences allows obtaining a high-quality plant material with yields in essential oils ranging among 0.85 and 1.33 EO/kg fresh flowers for EC and CS, respectively. The order of magnitude agrees with previous published data, also if a direct comparison is not easy to perform, due to the different cultivars, variability of operative conditions, different plant parts used, distillation of fresh/dry rather than raw/shredded material, harvesting periods and others [
