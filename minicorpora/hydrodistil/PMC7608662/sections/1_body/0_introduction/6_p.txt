0: In this regard, the present study aimed to investigate the chemical profile, and the antifungal and anti-inflammatory activities of  Thymus albicans essential oil from Portugal and its major compounds, concomitantly highlighting the mechanisms of action underlying these effects.
1: These bioactivities were selected taking into account their current relevance in the clinic.
2: In fact, invasive fungal infections are an increasingly important global health burden accounting for 1.66 million deaths every year 31.
3: While these mainly affect immunocompromised individuals, superficial fungal infections are reported to affect between 20 and 25% of the worlds population, including immunocompetent individuals 32.
4: Treatment failure and high relapse rates are mainly correlated with the extensive use of a limited number of non-selective antifungal drugs (e.g.
5: fluconazole, amphotericin B and terbinafine) which leads to off-target toxicity and to the emergence of resistance among the main etiologic agents 33.
6: Chronic inflammation is another factor that contributes to the successful colonization of the host tissues by pathogenic fungi and may impede disease eradication 34.
7: Taken together, these facts justify the urgency for therapeutic alternatives, preferentially combining selective antifungal and anti-inflammatory activities.
