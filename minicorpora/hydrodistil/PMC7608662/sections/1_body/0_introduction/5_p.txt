0: Thymus mastichina is one of the most industrially relevant thyme species, currently employed in the production of cleaning products, perfumes, fragrances, soaps and other cosmetics 13,  14.
1: It is widely cultivated in Portugal and Spain, and has an ISO standard (4728:2003) specifying the quality parameters of the essential oil for industrial and commercial uses 15.
2: Several pharmacological activities have been reported for  T. mastichina essential oil, including antimicrobial activity 16  19, anti-inflammatory potential 20,  21, antioxidant activity 22  24 and cytotoxicity against cancer cell lines 25  27.
3: Due to the similarities between the chemical profile of  T. mastichina and  T. albicans essential oils, it seems reasonable to assume that both species might possess similar bioactive properties.
4: This assumption is in part corroborated by previous studies showing the antibacterial activity of  T. albicans essential oil against Gram-positive bacteria 28, its antioxidant activity 29,  30, its capacity to scavenge nitric oxide and to inhibit the activity of lipoxygenase in vitro, both commonly used as markers of anti-inflammatory potential 21.
5: As far as we know, those are the only studies on the bioactive potential of  T. albicans essential oil.
6: More studies are needed to further confirm the reported effects and to explore new bioactivities.
