0: The compounds were identified based on their GC retention indices on both columns and through their mass spectra.
1: Retention indices, calculated by linear interpolation relative to the retention times of C 8C 24n-alkanes (Eq.
2: 1) 62, were compared with those of authentic products included in the Faculty of Pharmacy of the University of Coimbra laboratory database and/or literature data 63,  64.
3: Acquired mass spectra were compared with reference spectra from the laboratory database, Wiley/NIST library and literature data 63,  65.
4: Relative amounts of individual components were calculated based on GC raw data areas without a response factor correction for flame ionization detection.
