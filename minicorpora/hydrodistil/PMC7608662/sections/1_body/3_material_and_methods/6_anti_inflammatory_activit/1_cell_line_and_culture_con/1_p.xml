<p id="Par41">The mouse macrophage cell line, RAW 264.7 (ATCC-TIB-71) was cultured in Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen, California, USA) supplemented with 10% (v/v) of non-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 3.02 g/L sodium bicarbonate (Sigma), 100 μg/mL streptomycin (Sigma) and 100 U/mL penicillin (Sigma). The cells were maintained at 37 °C in humidified atmosphere with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> and 95% air. Adhesion, growth and morphological patterns were monitored by optical microscopy. Cells were regularly sub-cultured every two–three days and kept in culture for a maximum of three months.
