0: The mouse macrophage cell line, RAW 264.7 (ATCC-TIB-71) was cultured in Dulbeccos modified eagle medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen, California, USA) supplemented with 10% (v/v) of non-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 3.02 g/L sodium bicarbonate (Sigma), 100 g/mL streptomycin (Sigma) and 100 U/mL penicillin (Sigma).
1: The cells were maintained at 37 C in humidified atmosphere with 5% CO 2 and 95% air.
2: Adhesion, growth and morphological patterns were monitored by optical microscopy.
3: Cells were regularly sub-cultured every twothree days and kept in culture for a maximum of three months.
