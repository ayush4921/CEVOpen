0: The effect of the  T. albicans essential oil on the disruption of  C. albicans ATCC 10231 preformed biofilm was investigated following the method described by Alves-Silva et al.
1: 66.
2: Briefly, a cell suspension of  C. albicans was prepared in Yeast Peptone Dextrose (YPD) broth (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% dextrose) and incubated for 24 h at 37 C. A final suspension of 1  10 6 CFU/mL was added to 96-well microtiter plates and incubated for 24 h at 37 C, to form the biofilms.
3: After three washing steps with PBS, the essential oils (0.162.5 L/mL) prepared in RPMI were added and incubated for 24 h at 37 C. Negative and positive controls were included using sterile and inoculated RPMI media, respectively.
