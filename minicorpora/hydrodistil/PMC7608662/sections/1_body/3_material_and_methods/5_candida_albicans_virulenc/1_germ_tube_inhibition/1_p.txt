0: Cell suspensions (1.0  0.2  10 6 CFU/mL) from overnight SDA cultures were prepared in NYP medium [N-acetylglucosamine (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA; 10 3 mol/L), yeast nitrogen base (Difco, Detroit, MI, USA; 3.35 g/L), proline (Fluka; 1023 mol/L) and NaCl (4.5 g/L), pH 6.7  0.1].
1: Serial two-fold essential oil dilutions were previously prepared in DMSO [maximum concentration of 1% (v/v)], and added to the inoculum suspensions to obtain a range of test concentrations from MIC value to MIC/64 (1.250.02 L/mL).
2: Oil-free controls with and without DMSO were included.
3: After 3 h of incubation in a static chamber at 37 C, homogenized cell suspensions of each treatment were mounted onto a Neubauer chamber; 100 cells per replica were counted and visually scored, excluding gemulating cells.
4: The percentage of filamentation was defined as the number of cells in which the size of the germ tube was equal or bigger than the blastopores diameter.
