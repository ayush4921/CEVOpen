0: The antifungal activity of  T. albicans essential oil and its major compounds (1,8-cineole, linalool, borneol and -terpineol) was evaluated against two  Candida strains isolated from recurrent cases of vulvovaginal and oral candidiasis ( C. krusei H9,  C. guilliermondii MAT23) and three type strains ( C. albicans ATCC 10231,  C. tropicalis ATCC 13803,  C. parapsilosis ATCC 90018); a  Cryptococcus neoformans type strain ( C. neoformans CECT 1078); three clinical dermatophyte strains isolated from nails and skin ( Epidermophyton floccosum FF9,  Microsporum canis FF1,  Trichophyton mentagrophytes FF7) and four type strains ( M. gypseum CECT 2908,  T. mentagrophytes var.
1: interdigitale CECT 2958,  T. rubrum CECT 2794,  T. verrucosum CECT 2992); one  Aspergillus clinical strain isolated from bronchial secretions ( A. flavus F44) and two type strains ( A. niger ATCC 16404,  A. fumigatus ATCC 46645).
2: The fungal isolates were stored on Sabouraud broth with 20% of glycerol at  80 C and previously cultured on Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (SDA) or Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) to ensure optimal growth characteristics and purity for the antifungal susceptibility testing.
