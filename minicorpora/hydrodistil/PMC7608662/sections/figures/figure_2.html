 <caption> Germ tube formation in Candida albicans ATCC 10231 treated with sub-inhibitory concentrations—ranging from MIC to MIC/64—of Thymus albicans essential oil and its main compounds (1,8-cineole, linalool, borneol and α-terpineol) . The values are presented as percentage of control (oil-free samples with 1% DMSO (v/v)) ± SEM of at least three independent experiments performed in duplicate. Statistical differences were calculated by one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s post hoc test (* p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01, *** p &lt; 0.001). </caption>
