 <caption> Influence of Thymus albicans essential oil on Candida albicans ATCC 10231 biofilm viability ( A) and effect on biofilm biomass after 24 h ( B). Each value represents the mean ± SEM of at least three independent experiments performed in duplicate. Statistical differences were calculated by one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s post hoc test (** p &lt; 0.01, *** p &lt; 0.001). The grey bar represents the minimum lethal concentration (MLC) of Thymus albicans essential oil against Candida albicans ATCC 10231. </caption>
