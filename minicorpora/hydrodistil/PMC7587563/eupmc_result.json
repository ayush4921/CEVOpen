    "<i>Cinnamomum camphora</i> (Linn.) Presl has been widely used in traditional Chinese medicine for a variety of purposes. Our previous study indicated the antibacterial mechanism of the essential oil (EO) from <i>C. camphora</i> leaves; however, its anti-inflammatory activity and the underlying mechanism have not been clearly demonstrated. Thus, the present study investigated its anti-inflammatory property. Our data revealed that EO significantly decreased the release of nitric oxide (NO) and the mRNA expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced BV2 microglial cells. EO also attenuated LPS-induced increase in the mRNA expression and secretion of inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-18, IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Furthermore, the metabolic profiles of LPS-induced BV2 microglial cells treated with or without EO were explored. Thirty-nine metabolites were identified with significantly different contents, including 21 upregulated and 18 downregulated ones. Five pathways were enriched by shared differential metabolites. Compared with the control cells, the glucose level was decreased, while the lactate level was increased, in the culture supernatant from LPS-stimulated cells, which were reversed by EO treatment. Moreover, compared to the LPS-treated group, the activities of phosphofructokinase (PFK) and pyruvate kinase (PK) in EO group were decreased. In summary, the current study demonstrated that EO from <i>C. camphora</i> leaves acts as an anti-inflammatory agent, which might be mediated through attenuating the glycolysis capacity of microglial cells."
