<p>To exclude the cytotoxicity, the BV2 microglial cells were treated with EO at concentrations ranging of 7.8‒250 µg/mL for 48 h. The viability of BV2 microglial cells was measured by the MTT assay. The results showed that EO did not obviously affect cell viability even at a concentration up to 250 µg/mL (
