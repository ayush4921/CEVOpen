<p>To confirm the anti-inflammatory effect of EO, the levels of inflammatory mediators, including IL-6, IL-18, IL-1β, and TNF-α, were evaluated on LPS-stimulated BV2 microglial cells. Compared with the control group, LPS increased IL-6, IL-18, IL-1β, and TNF-α transcriptions, which were decreased after treated with EO in concentration-dependent manners (

The ELISA results indicated that the secretion of IL-6, IL-18, IL-1β, and TNF-α in cell supernatants were remarkably increased in LPS group compared with the control; and EO treatment alleviated the elevated levels of IL-6, IL-18, IL-1β, and TNF-α (
