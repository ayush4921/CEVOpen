<p>To evaluate whether glycolytic activity was suppressed by EO treatment, lactate production, and glucose uptake were detected in BV2 microglial cells. Compared with the control group, the glucose level was decreased, while the lactate level was increased, in the culture supernatant of LPS-induced BV2 microglia cells, indicating that LPS treatment augmented the glycolytic capacity; however, the glucose level was increased and the lactate level was decreased after EO treatment, which indicated that EO suppressed the glycolytic capacity induced by LPS (
