<p>To further demonstrate the effect of EO on glycolysis, the activities of PK and PFK, key enzymes associated with glycolysis, were measured. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04796-f006">Figure 6</xref>, the PK activities for the control, model, and EO groups were 1940.37, 3798.00, and 3129.82 U/mg prot, respectively; the PFK activities for the control, model, and EO groups were 119.57, 149.32, and 122.10 U/mg prot, respectively. Compared to the control group, the activities for PK and PFK increased by 95.74% and 24.88% after treatment with LPS, respectively, whereas the activities for PK and PFK decreased by 17.59% and 18.23% after EO treatment. It suggested that EO could disturb the LPS-induced activation of glycolysis.
