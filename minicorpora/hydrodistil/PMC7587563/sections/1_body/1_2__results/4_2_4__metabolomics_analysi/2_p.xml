<p>To investigate the metabolic differences among the control group, model group, and EO group, orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was applied for the recognition of the sample patterns, followed by ranking the altered metabolites in loading. The three groups were separated obviously (

Alanine, hexadecanoic acid, aspartic acid, valine, and myo-inositol showed the largest correlations and covariances in the predictive component between the model group and the EO group (
