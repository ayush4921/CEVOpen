<p>Six biological and two technical replicates yielded 36 data points in this study. There were 60 metabolites for subsequent analysis after data processing. KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) was used to retrieve the biological categories of the identified metabolites. The cells treated with LPS alone were set as model group, and those treated with neither EO nor LPS were set as control group. The abundance of 39 metabolites in the EO group was different in comparison of the model group (
