<p>Five impacted pathways were enriched by shared differential metabolites, including alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle), galactose metabolism, fatty acid biosynthesis, and pantothenate and Coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis, between the model and EO groups (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04796-f004">Figure 4</xref>B, most of metabolites enriched in the five pathways were decreased. The alanine aspartate and glutamate metabolism pathway was mostly impacted among the altered metabolic pathways under EO treatment (
