<p>In order to investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of EO, NO production was evaluated in LPS-induced BV2 microglial cells. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04796-f001">Figure 1</xref>B, the NO production in LPS exposed cells was significantly increased, compared with the control cells, whereas EO treatment concentration-dependently decreased NO production in BV2 microglial cells. Subsequently, RT-PCR results showed that EO suppressed the LPS-induced increase of iNOS expression in a concentration-dependent manner (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04796-f001">Figure 1</xref>C). These results indicated that EO inhibited NO production through downregulating iNOS mRNA level in LPS-induced BV2 microglial cells.
