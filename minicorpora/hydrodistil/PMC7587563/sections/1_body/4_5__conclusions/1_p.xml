<p>In summary, our studies showed that EO exerts anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting iNOS gene expression and NO production, as well as the expression and secretion of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-18, IL-1β, and TNF-α) in LPS-treated BV2 microglial cells. LPS promotes significant metabolic changes, resulting in increasing glycolysis, whereas EO suppresses the increase of glucose consumption and lactate production in LPS-stimulated BV2 microglial cells, which was related to the decreasing activities of key enzymes in glycolysis. Therefore, these results suggested that EO also acts as an anti-inflammatory agent via attenuating the LPS-induced glycolysis capacity. Furthermore, these data suggested a molecular pathway that directly links glycolysis to the anti-inflammatory program of BV2 microglial cells, suggesting a potential role for metabolic therapies in treating inflammation.</p>
