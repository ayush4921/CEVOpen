<p>In order to assess the anti-inflammatory activity of EO and explore the underlying mechanisms, this study was designed to detect NO production, cytokines secretion, and mRNA expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS), IL-6, IL-18, IL-1β, and TNF-α in LPS-induced BV2 microglial cells. Furthermore, GC-MS-based metabolomics analysis and the glycolytic enzyme activity were investigated. Herein, we desire to provide better insight into the anti-inflammatory potential of EO.</p>
