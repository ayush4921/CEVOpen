0: In order to assess the anti-inflammatory activity of EO and explore the underlying mechanisms, this study was designed to detect NO production, cytokines secretion, and mRNA expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS), IL-6, IL-18, IL-1, and TNF- in LPS-induced BV2 microglial cells.
1: Furthermore, GC-MS-based metabolomics analysis and the glycolytic enzyme activity were investigated.
2: Herein, we desire to provide better insight into the anti-inflammatory potential of EO.
