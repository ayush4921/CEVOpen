<p>In recent years, increasing evidence indicates that glycolysis plays an important role in the development of inflammation [

 <xref rid="B24-molecules-25-04796" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Glycolysis, a ubiquitous metabolic pathway in mammals, is regulated by multiple glycolytic enzymes, including phosphofructokinase (PFK) and pyruvate kinase (PK) [

A previous study showed that lidocaine inhibits the secretion of inflammatory cytokines in LPS-induced peritoneal macrophages by inhibiting the glycolytic pathway [
