<p>Inflammation is self-protective responses of body tissues to harmful stimuli, such as pathogens, damaged cells, or irritants [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-25-04796" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Dysregulated inflammation, such as long-term chronic inflammation, has been considered to play key roles in the onset and development of metabolic disorders, neurodegeneration, and cardiovascular diseases [

 <xref rid="B17-molecules-25-04796" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. It is of great significance to attenuate the increases of various inflammatory mediators, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, and nitric oxide (NO) [

 <xref rid="B21-molecules-25-04796" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Metabolomics is considered to be a powerful platform to explore the potential mechanisms of drugs at the biochemical level. A recent study investigated the anti-neuroinflammatory potential of

 <xref rid="B22-molecules-25-04796" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Moreover, effective therapeutic drugs for neuroinflammation are lacking. The anti-inflammatory activity of EO and its potential mechanisms remain largely unelucidated. Therefore, it is of significance to use BV2 microglia cells to study the anti-inflammatory effect of EO.
