0: In recent years, increasing evidence indicates that glycolysis plays an important role in the development of inflammation [ 23, 24].
1: Glycolysis, a ubiquitous metabolic pathway in mammals, is regulated by multiple glycolytic enzymes, including phosphofructokinase (PFK) and pyruvate kinase (PK) [ 25, 26].
2: Activation of the glycolytic pathway provides essential biomacromolecules, including amino acids and fatty acids, to synthesize inflammatory mediators in cells.
3: LPS-induced cells undergo changes in glycolytic metabolism [ 27].
4: The increased level of lactate is also related to glycolytic metabolism [ 28, 29].
5: Furthermore, lactate has been reported to enhance LPS-stimulated proinflammatory responses [ 30].
6: Therefore, the anti-inflammatory activity of molecules might be related to their effect on glycolytic pathway.
7: A previous study showed that lidocaine inhibits the secretion of inflammatory cytokines in LPS-induced peritoneal macrophages by inhibiting the glycolytic pathway [ 31].
