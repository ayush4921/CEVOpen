0: Inflammation is self-protective responses of body tissues to harmful stimuli, such as pathogens, damaged cells, or irritants [ 13].
1: Dysregulated inflammation, such as long-term chronic inflammation, has been considered to play key roles in the onset and development of metabolic disorders, neurodegeneration, and cardiovascular diseases [ 13, 14].
2: Recently, many studies investigated that microglia-mediated neuroinflammation plays an essential role in the pathophysiological process of multiple neurological disorders [ 15, 16, 17].
3: It is of great significance to attenuate the increases of various inflammatory mediators, including tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1, and nitric oxide (NO) [ 18, 19, 20].
4: In addition, inflammatory response is usually associated with metabolic changes [ 21].
5: Metabolomics is considered to be a powerful platform to explore the potential mechanisms of drugs at the biochemical level.
6: A recent study investigated the anti-neuroinflammatory potential of  Clinacanthus nutans leaf extracts towards lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced BV2 microglial cells by using metabolomics approach [ 22].
7: Moreover, effective therapeutic drugs for neuroinflammation are lacking.
8: The anti-inflammatory activity of EO and its potential mechanisms remain largely unelucidated.
9: Therefore, it is of significance to use BV2 microglia cells to study the anti-inflammatory effect of EO.
