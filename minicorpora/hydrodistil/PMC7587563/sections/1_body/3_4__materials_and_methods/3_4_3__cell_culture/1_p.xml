<p>The BV2 microglial cells were obtained from the Cell Bank of Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology (Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China). Cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 g/mL streptomycin in a humidified incubator (Thermo Fisher, San Diego, CA, USA) containing 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> at 37 Â°C. A TPVG solution (0.2% trypsin, 0.05% glucose and 0.2% EDTA in phosphate buffer saline solution) was used for cell dissociation.
