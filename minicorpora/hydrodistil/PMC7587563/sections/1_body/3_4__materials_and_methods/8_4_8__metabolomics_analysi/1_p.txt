0: BV2 microglial cells were collected by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 3 min, washed with PBS three times, and resuspended in methanol.
1: The cells were homogenized by ultrasonic, followed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm at 4 C for 10 min.
2: The supernatant of each sample was collected, and 10 L ribitol (0.1 mg/mL) was added as the internal standard for analysis.
3: Then, the supernatants were concentrated in a rotary vacuum centrifuge device (LABCONCO).
4: The dried extracts were used for GC-MS analysis, as described in a previous study [ 12].
5: In brief, samples were derivatized.
6: A 90 min reaction at 37 C with 80 L of 20 mg/mL methoxyamine hydrochloride in pyridine was carried out to protect carbonyl moieties.
7: Then, derivatization of acidic protons was performed at 37 C for 30 min with the addition of 80 L of  N-methyl- N-(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA).
8: The derivatized sample (1 L) was injected into a DB-5MS capillary column (30 m  250 m  0.25 m) by using the splitless model, and the analysis was fulfilled on an Agilent 7890A/5975MSD system.
9: The temperature of the GC oven was first maintained at 70 C for 5 min, then increased to 270 C at a rate of 2 C/min, and finally kept at 270 C for 5 min.
10: Helium was used as the carrier gas with a flow rate of 1 mL/min.
11: The electron impact ionization was of 70 eV energy.
12: The mass spectrometer was worked at 60600  m/z.
13: Each sample contained six biological and two technical replicates.
