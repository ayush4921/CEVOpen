<p>BV2 microglial cells were collected by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 3 min, washed with PBS three times, and resuspended in methanol. The cells were homogenized by ultrasonic, followed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant of each sample was collected, and 10 μL ribitol (0.1 mg/mL) was added as the internal standard for analysis. Then, the supernatants were concentrated in a rotary vacuum centrifuge device (LABCONCO). The dried extracts were used for GC-MS analysis, as described in a previous study [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-25-04796" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In brief, samples were derivatized. A 90 min reaction at 37 °C with 80 μL of 20 mg/mL methoxyamine hydrochloride in pyridine was carried out to protect carbonyl moieties. Then, derivatization of acidic protons was performed at 37 °C for 30 min with the addition of 80 μL of

 <italic>N</italic>-(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA). The derivatized sample (1 μL) was injected into a DB-5MS capillary column (30 m × 250 µm × 0.25 µm) by using the splitless model, and the analysis was fulfilled on an Agilent 7890A/5975MSD system. The temperature of the GC oven was first maintained at 70 °C for 5 min, then increased to 270 °C at a rate of 2 °C/min, and finally kept at 270 °C for 5 min. Helium was used as the carrier gas with a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The electron impact ionization was of 70 eV energy. The mass spectrometer was worked at 60–600
