0: BV2 microglial cells (1  10 6 cells/well) were incubated into 6-well plates for 24 h. The cells were treated with different concentrations of EO in the presence or absence of LPS (25 ng/mL) for 24 h. The RNA samples were isolated with Trizol reagent, and reversely transcribed into complementary DNA using HiScript II Q RT SuperMix for qPCR.
1: Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using the HieffTM qPCR SYBR  Green Master Mix according to the manufacturers protocol and detected by the LightCycler 96 Real-Time PCR System.
2: All experiments were performed in triplicate.
3: Relative mRNA levels were calculated using the 2 Ct method.
4: GAPDH was used as a housekeeping gene.
5: The primer sequences are shown in  Table 1.
