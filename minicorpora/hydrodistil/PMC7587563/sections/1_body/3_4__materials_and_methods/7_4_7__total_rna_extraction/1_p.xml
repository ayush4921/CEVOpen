<p>BV2 microglial cells (1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/well) were incubated into 6-well plates for 24 h. The cells were treated with different concentrations of EO in the presence or absence of LPS (25 ng/mL) for 24 h. The RNA samples were isolated with Trizol reagent, and reversely transcribed into complementary DNA using HiScript II Q RT SuperMix for qPCR. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using the Hieff™ qPCR SYBR
 <sup>®</sup> Green Master Mix according to the manufacturer’s protocol and detected by the LightCycler 96 Real-Time PCR System. All experiments were performed in triplicate. Relative mRNA levels were calculated using the 2
 <sup>−ΔΔCt</sup> method. GAPDH was used as a housekeeping gene. The primer sequences are shown in
