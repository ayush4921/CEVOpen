0: BV2 microglial cells (5  10 4 cells/well) were seeded in a 12-well plate and incubated for 24 h. After treated with EO at different concentrations (100, 150, 200 g/mL) and stimulated with LPS (25 ng/mL) for 24 h, the release of IL-6, IL-18, IL-1, and TNF- in the culture supernatants was quantified by using the corresponding ELISA kits according to the manufacturers protocols.
