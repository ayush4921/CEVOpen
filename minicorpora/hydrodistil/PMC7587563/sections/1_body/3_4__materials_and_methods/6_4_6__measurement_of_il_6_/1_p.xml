<p>BV2 microglial cells (5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well) were seeded in a 12-well plate and incubated for 24 h. After treated with EO at different concentrations (100, 150, 200 µg/mL) and stimulated with LPS (25 ng/mL) for 24 h, the release of IL-6, IL-18, IL-1β, and TNF-α in the culture supernatants was quantified by using the corresponding ELISA kits according to the manufacturers’ protocols.
