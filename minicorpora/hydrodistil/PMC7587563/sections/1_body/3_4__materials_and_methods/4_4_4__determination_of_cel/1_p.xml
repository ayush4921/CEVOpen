<p>BV2 microglial cells (5.0 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> cells/well) were incubated in a 96-well plate for 24 h and then treated with EO at different concentrations. After 48 h, cell viability was measured by MTT assay as described in previously reported protocol with a little bit adjustment [

 <xref rid="B43-molecules-25-04796" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In brief, 20 µL of 5 mg/mL MTT was added to each well and the cells were incubated at 37 °C in the dark. After 4 h, the supernatant was removed. Then, the formazan crystals were dissolved in 100 µL of DMSO, after which the absorbance was measured at 490 nm.
