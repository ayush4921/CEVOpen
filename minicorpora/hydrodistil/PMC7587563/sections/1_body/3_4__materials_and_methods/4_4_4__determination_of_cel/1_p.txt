0: BV2 microglial cells (5.0  10 3 cells/well) were incubated in a 96-well plate for 24 h and then treated with EO at different concentrations.
1: After 48 h, cell viability was measured by MTT assay as described in previously reported protocol with a little bit adjustment [ 42, 43].
2: In brief, 20 L of 5 mg/mL MTT was added to each well and the cells were incubated at 37 C in the dark.
3: After 4 h, the supernatant was removed.
4: Then, the formazan crystals were dissolved in 100 L of DMSO, after which the absorbance was measured at 490 nm.
