<p>BV2 microglial cells (5.5 Ã— 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well) were incubated in a 96-well plate for 24 h and then treated with EO at different concentrations in the absence or presence of LPS (25 ng/mL). The cells treated with LPS alone were set as the model group, and those treated with neither EO nor LPS were set as the control group. After 24 h, NO production was determined by measuring the amount of nitrite in cell culture supernatants using the nitric oxide assay kit.
