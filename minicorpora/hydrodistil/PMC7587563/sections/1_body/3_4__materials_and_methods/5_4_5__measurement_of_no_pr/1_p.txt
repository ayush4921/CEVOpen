0: BV2 microglial cells (5.5  10 4 cells/well) were incubated in a 96-well plate for 24 h and then treated with EO at different concentrations in the absence or presence of LPS (25 ng/mL).
1: The cells treated with LPS alone were set as the model group, and those treated with neither EO nor LPS were set as the control group.
2: After 24 h, NO production was determined by measuring the amount of nitrite in cell culture supernatants using the nitric oxide assay kit.
