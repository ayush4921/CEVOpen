<p>Recent studies have shown that pro-inflammatory responses of microglia are driven by glycolysis, which is associated with high level of glucose uptake, revealing the crucial function of glycolysis in inflammation responses [

The experimental results showed that EO inhibits LPS-induced increase of glucose consumption and lactate production, suggesting that EO might inhibit the glycolytic ability in LPS-induced BV2 microglia cells. Growing evidence indicates that glycolysis is closely linked with several key enzymes, which are crucial for the regulation of glycolysis, including PFK and PK [

 <xref rid="B41-molecules-25-04796" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Similarly, our results verified that cells treated with EO suffered a decrease in the activities of PK and PFK and disrupted glycolysis. Glycolysis converts glucose into pyruvate, which is subsequently converted into lactate, and secreted, or gets into the TCA cycle, which pointed out the importance of glycolysis. Therefore, further study about the factors affecting glycolysis can be the direction of our research.
