<p>Inflammation, an important protective response of organism, aims to eliminate or scavenge harmful stimuli, including damaged cells and pathogens, so as to restore normal tissue structure and function. A wild inflammation causes harmful effects to tissues and microcirculatory systems, and leads to severe complications [

NO plays an important role in the immune system and the maintenance of body quiescence, but excessive NO causes a variety of inflammatory related diseases. In addition, the upregulation of inflammatory factors persisting at an inflammatory site is important, such as IL-6, IL-18, IL-1β, and TNF-α. Overproduction of these mediators recruits downstream effector cells (such as neutrophils), and directs the natural evolution of the inflammatory response [

 <xref rid="B35-molecules-25-04796" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Kim et al. found that ginsenosides exert anti-inflammatory activities by suppressing the inflammatory enzymes, such as iNOS and COX-2, as well as the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, in LPS-stimulated macrophages and microglial cells [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-25-04796" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Currently, EO was found to inhibit LPS-induced NO production via suppression of iNOS expression at the mRNA level. In addition, the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-18, IL-1β, and TNF-α) was significantly reduced by EO in BV2 microglial cells. These results showed that EO notably inhibits the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators, suggesting that it could inhibit the occurrence of inflammatory responses or reduce the aggravation of inflammatory mediators.
