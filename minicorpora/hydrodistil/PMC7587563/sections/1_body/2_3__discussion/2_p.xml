<p>Recent findings suggested that inflammation is closely related to metabolic disorders [

 <xref rid="B39-molecules-25-04796" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]; thus, the metabolites of biological organisms can be used as important indicators to reflect the inhibition or activation of related metabolic pathways under inflammation. The significantly different metabolites can be witnessed by metabolomics profiling analysis [

Therefore, this study applied metabolomics to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanism of EO in LPS-induced BV2 microglial cells. A previous study showed that the changes in the metabolite levels were related to the anti-inflammatory effects of volatile oils from

Similarly, the relative concentrations of metabolites between the model group and the EO group further demonstrated that physiological metabolism of LPS-induced BV2 microglial cells was restored after EO treatment. According to the metabolomics analysis, most were amino acids among the 39 significantly different metabolites, which play essential roles in an organism. Further enrichment analysis and pathway analysis pointed mainly to the involvement of amino acid, glucose metabolism, and fatty acid metabolism. Based on metabolic pathway analysis, the TCA cycle plays the most important role in the amino acid metabolism, and the major metabolic part of galactose metabolism is glycolysis [
