   <bold>A</bold>) Enriched pathways in the presence of the EO significantly enriched pathways were plotted. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Heat map of the average levels of differential metabolites in the five enriched pathways shared by the two groups. Red and green, respectively, indicate increase and decrease in the metabolites scaled to mean and standard deviation of row metabolite level (see the color scale).
