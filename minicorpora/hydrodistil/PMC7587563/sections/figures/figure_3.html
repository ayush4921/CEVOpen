 <caption> ( A) Principal Component Analysis (PCA) analysis of three groups. Each dot represents the technological replicate analysis of samples. ( B) S-plot generated from orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). Dot represents metabolites, which are p [ 1] &lt; −0.05 or &gt; 0.05 and p (corr) [ 1] &lt; −0.5 or &gt; 0.5 and marked in red dot. ( C) Scatter diagram of five biomarkers, each dot shows a technical replicate. n = 6. *** p &lt; 0.001 vs. model group. </caption>
