<p>However, a study by Rangel 
 <italic>et al.</italic>[
 <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] showed the presence of ergosterol in the case of 
 <italic>Candida tropicalis</italic> species; the EOC has a weak activity on the permeability of the cell membrane. This effect was not found in the 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> strains because the presence of ergosterol was not associated with the increase in the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Also, the essential oil extracted from the leaves of 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic> Blume had eugenol as a component, which gave him his antifungal action on 
 <italic>Candida spp.</italic>, although the performance of phase I and II clinical trials should be tested on oral fungi so scientifically conclude. The study highlighted the anti-candida potency of the essential oil of 
 <italic>Thymus capitatus</italic> against 
 <italic>Candida</italic> species sensitive to fluconazole.
