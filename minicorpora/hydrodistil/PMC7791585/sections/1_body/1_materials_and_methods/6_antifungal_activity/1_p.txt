0: Direct observation was made, and the measurement of the inhibitory halo (KirbyBauer method)[ 68910] of four concentrations at 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% of the EOC and nystatin on strains of  Candida albicans ATCC 10231 was taken; the data obtained was recorded in a data collection sheet where the inhibition halos measurements in millimeters, formed in each of the discs embedded with the EOC.
1: In the period of 24 and 48h of having made the sowing, the readings and filling of the collection sheet were made, taking into account the identification of the sample, identification of the concentration used, and the measurement in millimeters of the halo of inhibition formed [ Figure 2].
