0: Subsequently, from the result of the extraction of the essential oil, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% dilutions were prepared, placed in different bottles and properly labeled.
1: The sowings were carried out in Saboraud dextrose agar for the cultivation of fungi (yeasts and dermatophytes).
2: Once the cultures were done, they were stored in the incubator at 37C for a period of 24 hours.
3: After having achieved the growth of bacterial colonies, sensitivity tests were carried out.
4: The petri dishes were conditioned with the Mueller Hinton agar, in which each plate was seeded with  C. albicans ATCC 10231.
5: Next, five wells were made in each petri dish: four wells for the four concentrations of the EOC and the last one for the nystatin.
6: Finally, the inhibition halos were measured with a Mitutoyo calibrator, at 24- and 48-h intervals.
