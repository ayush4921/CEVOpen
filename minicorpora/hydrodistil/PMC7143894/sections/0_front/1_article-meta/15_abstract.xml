 <p>Volatile metabolites from 
  <italic>Frullania brasiliensis</italic> Raddi, 
  <italic>Herbertus juniperoideus</italic> (Sw.) Grolle, 
  <italic>Leptoscyphus hexagonus</italic> (Nees) Grolle, and 
  <italic>Syzygiella anomala</italic> (Lindenb. &amp; Gottsche) Steph collected in the south of Ecuador were investigated. Volatile secondary metabolites were extracted by hydrodistillation and analyzed by gas chromatography/flame ionization detector (GC/FID) and Gas chromatography/Mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Sixty-seven volatile compounds were identified in the four species, which represent between 80.12–90.17% of the total chemical composition. The major components were τ-muurolol (32.14%) and Germacrene-D (11.98%) in the essential oil of 
  <italic>F. brasiliensis</italic>, bicyclogermacrene (18.23%), and Caryophyllene oxide (15.29%) in the oil of 
  <italic>H. juniperoideus</italic>, Cabreuva oxide D (33.77%) and Elemol (18.55%) in the oil of 
  <italic>Leptoscyphus hexagonus</italic>, and Silphiperfola-5,7(14)-diene (25.22%) and Caryophyllene oxide (8.98%) in the oil of 
  <italic>Syzygiella anomala</italic>. This is the first report on volatile compounds for the species 
  <italic>Herbertus juniperoideus</italic>, 
  <italic>Leptoscyphus hexagonus</italic>, and 
  <italic>Syzygiella anomala</italic>.
