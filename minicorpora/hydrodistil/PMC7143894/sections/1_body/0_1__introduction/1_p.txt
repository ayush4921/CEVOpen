0: The Ecuador has a very rich liverworts flora over 770 species [ 1, 2, 3].
1: Liverworts produce secondary metabolites in abundance [ 4] with more than 1500 terpenoids and 350 aromatic compounds flavonoids [ 5, 6, 7].
2: In this context, liverworts produce terpenoids and aromatic compounds, many of which exhibit diverse, interesting biological properties related to antitumor, antimicrobial, antifungal, antioxidative, and insecticidal activities; cytotoxic and insect antifeedant [ 5].
3: Several studies have shown abundant secondary metabolites in foliose liverworts.
4: For example, Asakawa et al.
5: [ 8] studied by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC/MS) the volatile components of 25 taxa of the liverwort family Frullaniaceae from New Zealand, Australia and South America.
