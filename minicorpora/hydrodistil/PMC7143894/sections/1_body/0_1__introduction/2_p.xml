<p>In addition, chemical constituents of 
 <italic>Frullania serrata</italic> were isolated, and their structure was elucidated by nuclear magnetic resonance (1D- and 2D-NMR), high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HR-ESI-MS) and infrared spectroscopy (IR) [
 <xref rid="B9-metabolites-10-00092" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The chemical composition of 
 <italic>Frullania tamarisci</italic> essential oil was investigated using gas chromatography coupled to flame ionization detection (GC/FID), GC/MS, and NMR analyses [
 <xref rid="B10-metabolites-10-00092" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Compounds of 
 <italic>Frullania hamatiloba</italic> have been isolated and their structures were determined by a combination of the 
 <sup>1</sup>H- and 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR, MS, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV), IR, and X-ray crystallographic (X-ray) analysis [
 <xref rid="B11-metabolites-10-00092" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In another species of this genus, the 
 <italic>F. brasiliensis</italic> two eremophilanolides were established by NMR and X-ray analysis [
