 <xref rid="B7-metabolites-10-00092" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In this context, liverworts produce terpenoids and aromatic compounds, many of which exhibit diverse, interesting biological properties related to antitumor, antimicrobial, antifungal, antioxidative, and insecticidal activities; cytotoxic and insect antifeedant [
