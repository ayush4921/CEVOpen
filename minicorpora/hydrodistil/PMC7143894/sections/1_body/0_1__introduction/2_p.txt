0: In addition, chemical constituents of  Frullania serrata were isolated, and their structure was elucidated by nuclear magnetic resonance (1D- and 2D-NMR), high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HR-ESI-MS) and infrared spectroscopy (IR) [ 9].
1: The chemical composition of  Frullania tamarisci essential oil was investigated using gas chromatography coupled to flame ionization detection (GC/FID), GC/MS, and NMR analyses [ 10].
2: Compounds of  Frullania hamatiloba have been isolated and their structures were determined by a combination of the  1H- and  13C-NMR, MS, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV), IR, and X-ray crystallographic (X-ray) analysis [ 11].
3: In another species of this genus, the  F. brasiliensis two eremophilanolides were established by NMR and X-ray analysis [ 12].
