<p>Volatile metabolites of 
 <italic>Herbertus juniperoideus</italic> (Sw.) Grolle, 
 <italic>Leptoscyphus hexagonus</italic> (Nees) Grolle, and 
 <italic>Syzygiella anomala</italic> (Lindenb. &amp; Gottsche) Steph were qualitatively and quantitatively characterized for the first time, in addition to these three species of liverworts, volatile secondary metabolites of 
 <italic>Frullania brasiliensis</italic> Raddi were studied. A total of sixty-seven compounds were identified, which were mainly grouped into sesquiterpene hydrocarbons and oxygenated sesquiterpenes. The major components were Ï„-muurolol in 
 <italic>F. brasiliensis</italic>, bicyclogermacrene in 
 <italic>H. juniperoideus</italic>, Cabreuva oxide D in 
 <italic>L. hexagonus</italic> and silphiperfola-5,7(14)-diene in 
 <italic>S. anomala</italic>.
