<p>Many liverworts are endemic to the southern hemisphere, including Oceania and South America [
 <xref rid="B7-metabolites-10-00092" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In the Ecuador (South America), there are around 770 species of liverworts [
 <xref rid="B1-metabolites-10-00092" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B2-metabolites-10-00092" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-metabolites-10-00092" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], of which about eleven species have been previously studied. Liverworts (Hepaticae) are a rich source of terpenoids and aromatic compounds [
 <xref rid="B7-metabolites-10-00092" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In this research, chemical constituents of studied species of liverworts were mainly grouped into sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (SH) and oxygenated sesquiterpenes (OS). Only one monoterpene hydrocarbon (MH) (β-phellandrene) with RI 1023 was determined; below RI 1000, no compound was identified in any of the four species studied. However, in 
 <italic>Frullania tamarisci</italic> of France [
 <xref rid="B10-metabolites-10-00092" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], three compounds (α-pinene, 1-Octen-3-ol, and β-pinene) with RI below 1000 were identified, which would indicate that it is possible to isolate this type (MH) of compounds from liverworts.
