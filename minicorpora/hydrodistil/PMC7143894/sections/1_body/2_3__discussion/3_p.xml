<p>Between 2006 and 2001 Bard√≥n et al. [
 <xref rid="B12-metabolites-10-00092" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] studied the nonvolatile compounds from 
 <italic>Frullania brasiliensis</italic> of Argentina, achieving isolate and identify two eremophilanolides, 5-epidilatanolides A and B, as well as a new natural bibenzyl. In this same study, also were identified the nonvolatile compounds eudesmane-type sesquiterpene lactones nepalensolide A, nepalensolide B, (+)-frullanolide, and (+)-dihydrofrullanolide, hopanoid zeorin, four sterols stigmasta-4,22-dien-3,6-dione, stigmasta-4,22-dien-3-one, stigmasterol, and sitosterol, and a trace amount of atraric acid.
