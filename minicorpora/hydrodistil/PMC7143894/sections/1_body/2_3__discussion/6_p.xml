<p>In the Ecuadorian species, 
 <italic>Noteroclada confluens</italic> Taylor Ludwiczuk et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-metabolites-10-00092" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] determined that the major component with 49% is an unknown sesquiterpene alcohol (molecular ion M
 <sup>+</sup> 222), and that species also produced a large amount of bicyclogermacrene and an unidentified bibenzyl derivative (molecular ion M
 <sup>+</sup> 344]. According to Ludwiczuk et al. the main compounds occurring in 
 <italic>Symphyogyna brasiliensis</italic> Nees from Ecuador are Dihydroagarofurane (36.3%) and δ-selinene (20.6%), these species also produced cascarilladiene, selina-4,7-diene, eudesma-5,7(11)-diene, Bicyclogermacrene, thujopsene, calarene, γ- and δ-cuprenene, β-cubebene, bourbon-7(11)-ene and trans-dauca-4(11),7-diene [

 <xref rid="B17-metabolites-10-00092" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] determined that chemical profiles of lipophilic extracts of 
 <italic>Syzygiella rubricaulis</italic> (Nees) Stephani are rich in sesquiterpenes. Regarding the species 
 <italic>Leptoscyphus hexagonus</italic> and 
 <italic>Syzygiella anomala</italic>, no previous studies have been carried out.
