<p>Around the year 1991, Nagashima et al. [
 <xref rid="B13-metabolites-10-00092" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] investigated terpenoids and aromatic compounds of seven Ecuadorian liverworts. In the spieces 
 <italic>Frullania brasiliensis</italic> found in total two compounds, the sesquiterpenoids Arbusculin B and α-Bisabolol, the relative abundance percentages are not mentioned. In our study, for species 
 <italic>Frullania brasiliensis</italic> twenty-five compounds were identified, the main compound identified for this species was τ-muurolol (32.14%), that like the α-Bisabolol is an oxygenated sesquiterpenes of formula C
