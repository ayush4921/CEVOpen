<p>The GC/MS analyses were performed using an Agilent chromatograph coupled to a mass spectrometer (quadrupole) detector (model Agilent series 5973 inert). The spectrometer was operated at 70 eV, electron multiplier 1600 eV, scan rate: 2 scan/s, and mass range: 40–350

The identification of the oil components was based on a comparison of both mass spectrum data and relative retention indices with the published literature [
