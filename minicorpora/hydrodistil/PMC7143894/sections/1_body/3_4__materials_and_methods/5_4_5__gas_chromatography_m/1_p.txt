0: The GC/MS analyses were performed using an Agilent chromatograph coupled to a mass spectrometer (quadrupole) detector (model Agilent series 5973 inert).
1: The spectrometer was operated at 70 eV, electron multiplier 1600 eV, scan rate: 2 scan/s, and mass range: 40350  m/ z.
2: It was provided with a computerized system MSD-Chemstation D.01.00 SP1.
3: The same columns described in GC/FID section were used.
4: The ion source temperature was set at 250 C. The identification of the oil components was based on a comparison of both mass spectrum data and relative retention indices with the published literature [ 21, 22, 23].
5: The relative amounts of individual components were calculated based on the GC peak area (FID response) without using a correction factor.
