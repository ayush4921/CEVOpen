0: The volatile compounds isolation was realized from 1500 g of vegetal material of  Frullania brasiliensis, 4029 g of  Herbertus juniperoideus, 6045 g of  Leptoscyphus hexagonus and 4874 g of  Syzygiella anomala.
1: The material was processed fresh, immediately after arriving at the laboratory, between 8 and 12 h after being collected.
2: The plant material of each species was hydrodistilled for four hours using a Clevenger-type apparatus.
3: Subsequently, each extract sample (essential oil) was dried over sodium sulfate anhydrous and was stored in sealed vials, protecting them from light at 4 C until being used in the analysis [ 20].
