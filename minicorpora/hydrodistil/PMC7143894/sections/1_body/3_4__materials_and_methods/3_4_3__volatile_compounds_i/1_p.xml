<p>The volatile compounds isolation was realized from 1500 g of vegetal material of 
 <italic>Frullania brasiliensis</italic>, 4029 g of 
 <italic>Herbertus juniperoideus</italic>, 6045 g of 
 <italic>Leptoscyphus hexagonus</italic> and 4874 g of 
 <italic>Syzygiella anomala</italic>. The material was processed fresh, immediately after arriving at the laboratory, between 8 and 12 h after being collected. The plant material of each species was hydrodistilled for four hours using a Clevenger-type apparatus. Subsequently, each extract sample (essential oil) was dried over sodium sulfate anhydrous and was stored in sealed vials, protecting them from light at 4 Â°C until being used in the analysis [
