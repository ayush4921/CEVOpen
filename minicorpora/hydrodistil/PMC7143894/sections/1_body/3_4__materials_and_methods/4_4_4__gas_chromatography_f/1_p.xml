<p>The analyses of the chemical composition of the essential oils were performed on an Agilent gas chromatograph (model 6890N series) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID). A nonpolar column DB-5ms (5%-phenyl-methylpolyxilosane) 30 m × 0.25 mm, thickness 0.25 µm was used. An automatic injector (series 7683) in split mode was used. The samples, 1 µL of solution (1/100,

 <italic>v</italic>, essential oil/dichloromethane), were injected with a split ratio of 1:50. Helium was used as a carrier gas at 0.9 mL/min in constant flow mode. The initial oven temperature was held at 50 °C for 3 min, and then it was heated to 210 °C with a ramp of 2.5 °C/min, and the temperature was maintained for 3 min until the end. The injector and detector temperatures were of 210 °C and 250 °C, respectively. The retention index (IR) of the compounds was determined based on the standard of aliphatic hydrocarbons, which were injected after the oils at the same conditions.
