0: The analyses of the chemical composition of the essential oils were performed on an Agilent gas chromatograph (model 6890N series) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID).
1: A nonpolar column DB-5ms (5%-phenyl-methylpolyxilosane) 30 m  0.25 mm, thickness 0.25 m was used.
2: An automatic injector (series 7683) in split mode was used.
3: The samples, 1 L of solution (1/100,  v/ v, essential oil/dichloromethane), were injected with a split ratio of 1:50.
4: Helium was used as a carrier gas at 0.9 mL/min in constant flow mode.
5: The initial oven temperature was held at 50 C for 3 min, and then it was heated to 210 C with a ramp of 2.5 C/min, and the temperature was maintained for 3 min until the end.
6: The injector and detector temperatures were of 210 C and 250 C, respectively.
7: The retention index (IR) of the compounds was determined based on the standard of aliphatic hydrocarbons, which were injected after the oils at the same conditions.
