<p>The identification of volatile compounds present in liverworts of Ecuador was carried out by means of gas chromatography equipped with a flame ionization detector (GC/FID) and gas chromatography coupled to a mass spectrometer detector (GC/MS) using capillary nonpolar column DB-5ms. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the chemical composition of volatile compounds from 
 <italic>Herbertus juniperinus</italic>, 
 <italic>Leptoscyphus hexagonus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Syzygiella anomala</italic> (
 <xref rid="metabolites-10-00092-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In total, sixty-seven chemical constituents were identified in essential oil samples, representing 80.12–90.17% of the total composition. These constituents were grouped into monoterpene hydrocarbons (0.14%), oxygenated monoterpenes (0.79–1.16%), sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (19.61–65.39%), oxygenated sesquiterpenes (23.48–66.24%), diterpene hydrocarbons (0.23–0.87%), and other compounds (0.76–1.16%).
