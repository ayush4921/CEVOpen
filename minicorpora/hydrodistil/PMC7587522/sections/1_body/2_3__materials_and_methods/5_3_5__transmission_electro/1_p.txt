0: Transmission electron microscopy (JED 1230, JEOL Ltd., and Tokyo, Japan) was employed to characterize nanoemulsions.
1: Twenty microliters of diluted samples were placed on a film-coated 200-mesh copper specimen grid for 10 min, and the excess fluid was eliminated using a filter paper.
2: The grids were then stained with one drop of 3% phosphotungstic acid and allowed to dry for 3 min.
3: The coated grids were dried and examined under the TEM microscope.
4: The samples were also observed by operating at 160 kV, while the average particle size was calculated from TEM images using the ImageJ program [ 32].
