<p>Transmission electron microscopy (JED 1230, JEOL Ltd., and Tokyo, Japan) was employed to characterize nanoemulsions. Twenty microliters of diluted samples were placed on a film-coated 200-mesh copper specimen grid for 10 min, and the excess fluid was eliminated using a filter paper. The grids were then stained with one drop of 3% phosphotungstic acid and allowed to dry for 3 min. The coated grids were dried and examined under the TEM microscope. The samples were also observed by operating at 160 kV, while the average particle size was calculated from TEM images using the ImageJ program [
