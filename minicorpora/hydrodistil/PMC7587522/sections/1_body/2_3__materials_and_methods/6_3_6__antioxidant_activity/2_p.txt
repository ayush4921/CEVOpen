0: Cupric reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC) assay:CUPRAC was determined according to Bouratoua et al.
1: [ 34].
2: The method includes mixing of 40 L of sample solution with 50 L of a copper(II) chloride solution, 50 L of neocuproine alcoholic solution, and 60 L of ammonium acetate aqueous buffer at pH 7.
3: After 30 min, the absorbance was read at 450 nm.Results were recorded as absorbance compared with the absorbance of TROLOX and ascorbic acid, which were used as antioxidant standards.
