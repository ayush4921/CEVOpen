0: Estimation of flavonoids content: The flavonoid content in essential oils and nanoemulsions was determined by the measurement of absorbance at 430 nm.
1: Absorbance values depend on complex flavonoidaluminum formation.
2: Rutin was used to make the calibration curve, and then 1 mL of diluted samples was separately mixed with 1 mL of a 2% aluminum chloride methanolic solution.
3: After incubation at room temperature for 15 min, the absorbance of the reaction mixture was measured at 430 nm, and the flavonoid content was expressed in mg per g of rutin equivalent (RE) [ 36].
