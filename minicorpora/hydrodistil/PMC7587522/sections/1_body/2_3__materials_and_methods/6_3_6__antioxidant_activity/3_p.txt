0: The ABTS free radicalscavenging assay: The antioxidant activity of the HD oil and its nanoemulsion was determined by their ability to decolorize the radical cation (ABTS +) as previously detailed [ 34].
1: The method comprises the addition of 180 L of ABTS solution to 20 L of sample solution in methanol at different concentrations.
2: After 10 min, the percentage inhibition at 734 nm was calculated for each concentration relative to a blank absorbance (methanol).
3: The scavenging capability of ABTS was calculated using the following equation:
