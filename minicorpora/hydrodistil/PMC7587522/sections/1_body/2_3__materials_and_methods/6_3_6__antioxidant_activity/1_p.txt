0: DPPH radicalscavenging assay:In this spectrophotometric method, DPPH was used as a reagent to measure the DPPH free radicalscavenging activity of the hydrodistilled (HD) and nanoemulsions of the  S. satureioides essential oil in comparison with TROLOX and ascorbic acid.
1: The absorbance was measured at 517 nm using a spectrophotometer (Cecil 2010, Cecil Instr.
2: Ltd., Cambridge, UK) [ 33].
3: All tests were repeated three times, and the results were averaged.
