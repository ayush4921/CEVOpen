0: The analysis of volatile constituents from the HD and nanoemulsions of  S. satureioides essential oil was performed using a GCMS apparatus.
1: A trace GC ultra-chromatography system equipped with an ISQ-mass spectrometer and a 60 m  0.25 mm  0.25 m-thick TG-5MS capillary column (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was programmed from 50 C with a holding time of 3 min, and then the temperature was increased at a rate of 4 C per min to 140 C with a holding time of 5 min.
2: Consequently, the temperature was increased at a rate of 6 C per minute to 260 C for a 5-min isothermal holding time.
3: The injector temperature was 180 C, the ion source temperature was 200 C, and the transition line temperature was 250 C. The carrier gas was helium with a constant flow rate of 1.0 mL min 1.
4: The mass spectrometer had a scan range from m/z 40450, and the ionization energy was set at 70 Ev.
5: The identification of compounds was based on matching with the MS computer library (NIST library, 2005 version) and comparison with those of authentic compounds and published data [ 3, 4, 5, 10, 16].
6: The relative percentage of the identified constituents was calculated from the GC peak areas, and Kovats index was calculated for each compound using the retention times of a homologous series of C 6C 26 n-alkanes and by matching with the literature [ 16].
