0: Hep G2 and THLE2 were cultured at a density of 1  10 4 cells/well (100L) in a culture medium (DMEM) supplemented with antibiotics (10,000 U of penicillin and 10 mg of streptomycin in 0.9% saline) and 10% serum (FBS) and then incubated for 24 h at 37 C and 5% CO 2.
1: After attachment for 24 h, a serially diluted essential oil and its nanoemulsions were applied at concentrations ranging from 1000 to 6.25 g/mL for THLE2 and from 200 to 6.25g/mL for HepG2 cells.
2: A positive control (5-FU) at concentrations ranging from 400 to 5 g/mL was applied in parallel.
3: Subsequently, 10 L of a 12-mM MTT stock solution (5 mg/mL MTT in sterile PBS) was added to each well.
4: After incubation for 4 h at 37 C, the MTT solution was eliminated, and the precipitated purple formazan crystal was dissolved in DMSO for 20 min.
5: A negative control of 10 L of the MTT stock solution was added to 100 L of the uncultured medium.
6: With an ELISA reader, the absorbance was measured at 570 nm.
7: The curve was illustrated on the basis of the variation of the proportions of surviving cells [(OD of sample  OD of blank)/(OD of control  OD of blank)  100%] according to concentrations, and IC 50 was calculated using the sigmoidal curve obtained [ 26].
