<p>The cytotoxic effect of hemp EOs (derived from male and female inflorescences of cv CS) was evaluated in HaCaT (human keratinocytes) and NHF A12 fibroblasts cell lines by MTT assay (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03451-f004">Figure 4</xref>). Cells were treated with different dilutions, from pure (1040 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) to 0.163 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>, for 24 h. EO from male CS inflorescence showed higher cytotoxicity than EO from female CS. However, NHF A12 were more resistant (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03451-f004">Figure 4</xref>). The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values for the EO from male CS inflorescence were 2.23 ± 0.09 and 3.71 ± 0.1 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>, on HaCaT and NHF A12 cells, respectively, while for the EO from female CS inflorescence, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were higher than 5.2 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>. To further evaluate the potential anti-inflammatory effects of hemp EOs, we firstly tested the ones obtained from male and female inflorescences of cv CS in both cell lines, at 0.65 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>.
