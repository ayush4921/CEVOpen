<p>Through the analysis of cytokine gene expression profiles, we evaluated the modulation of the main proinflammatory genes in HaCaT and NHF A12 cell lines treated with the two EOs from male inflorescences of cv CS and their combination with ETO, at 24 h post-treatment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03451-f006">Figure 6</xref>). ETO, at low doses, stimulated an inflammatory effect. The results showed that the EOs did not modulate the basal levels of the cytokines analyzed and the transcription factor STAT-3. However, both EOs were effective in reducing the ETO-induced inflammatory pathways.
