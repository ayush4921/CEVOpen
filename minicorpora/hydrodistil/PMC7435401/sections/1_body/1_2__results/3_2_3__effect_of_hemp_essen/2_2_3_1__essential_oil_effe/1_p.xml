<p>In order to evaluate the potential cytotoxic effects, the EOs from male and female inflorescences of cv CS were tested on HaCaT and NHF A12 cell lines. The results showed that the two EOs did not display cellular damage and DNA fragmentation at 0.65 mg mL
 <sup>âˆ’1</sup>. Instead, ETO, used at a cytotoxic dose, evidenced cell damage and DNA fragmentation. Therefore, the EOs at the appropriate dilution did not cause any damage to either cell line (
