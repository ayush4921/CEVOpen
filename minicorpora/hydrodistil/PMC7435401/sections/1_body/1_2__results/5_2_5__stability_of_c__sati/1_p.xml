<p>Sample A10 and A21 showed optimal stability at room temperature, evaluated at different time points, for a total storage period of six months. As reported in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03451-f008">Figure 8</xref>, the size of the oil droplets remained almost unchanged, confirming the thermodynamic stability of these systems. In particular, S10 has Z-average and PDI values of 177.9 nm and 0.173, respectively, while S21 has Z-average and PDI values of of 138.4 nm and 0.245, respectively.
