<p>A doseâ€“response effect was observed in the insecticidal activity of the three EOs in both 
 <italic>An. stephensi</italic> and 
 <italic>An. gambiae</italic>. In 
 <italic>An. stephensi</italic>, mortality caused by hemp EO at 100 ppm was 82.7% and 100% (Felina 32), 90.2% and 94.2% (CS female), and 89.8% and 90.5% (CS male) on larvae and pupae, respectively. At the same concentration (100 ppm), the mortality produced on 
 <italic>An. gambiae</italic> was 91.1% and 84.9% (Felina 32), 91.6% and 79.6% (CS female), and 89.8% and 79.7% (CS male) on larvae and pupae, respectively. Mortality of 100% was observed when the mosquitoes (L3 and pupae) were exposed at the maximus dilution of the three EOs.
