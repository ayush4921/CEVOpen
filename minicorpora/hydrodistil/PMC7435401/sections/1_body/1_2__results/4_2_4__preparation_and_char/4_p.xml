<p>Then, we decided to add ethyl oleate, commonly used as an oily phase in such systems, to overcome instability issues related to the physicochemical properties of the EO. In fact, ethyl oleate showed good solvent properties, making the oil phase more homogeneous by allowing a better dispersion and encapsulation of active ingredients. The minimum EOâ€“ethyl oleate ratio allowing a good dispersion of the EO in the oil phase was fixed at 1:1. Thus, keeping the amount of oil phase constant at 6% (
