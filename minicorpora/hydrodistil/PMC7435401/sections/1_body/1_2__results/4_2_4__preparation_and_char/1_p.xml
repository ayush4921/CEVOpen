<p>NEs are colloidal systems that offer the great advantage of being able to encapsulate a higher amount of oil phase compared to similar nanosystems, i.e., microemulsions. Moreover, they require a very low amount of surfactant with a SOR (surfactantâ€“oil ratio) recorded between 1 and 2, compared to that of microemulsions, which is generally higher than 2 (SOR &gt; 2). However, NEs are energetically disadvantaged nanosystems; thus, an external energetic input is required for their formation. In this respect, for the achievement of EO NEs, samples were subjected to a pressure of 130 MPa, selected after the evaluation of different operating pressure, from 50 to 150 MPa.</p>
