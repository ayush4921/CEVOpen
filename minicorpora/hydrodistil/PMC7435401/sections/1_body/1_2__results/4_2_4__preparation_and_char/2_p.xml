<p>After a preliminary screening using a model oil phase, the quantitative composition of the NEs has been selected as follows: 6% (

However, this composition was not suitable for the encapsulation of the EO from female inflorescences of cv CS; in fact, formulations A8 and A9 recorded a high PDI (polydispersity index) value at t0, indicating the polydispersity of the size distribution, with a particle population with a mean diameter higher than 500 nm. Moreover, after 1 month of storage, instability phenomena, i.e., creaming and phase separation, occurred in such samples (
