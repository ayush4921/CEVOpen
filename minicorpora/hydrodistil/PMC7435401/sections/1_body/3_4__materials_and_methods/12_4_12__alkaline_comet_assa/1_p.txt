0: Cells were plated in six-well plates (3  10 4 cells well 1) one day before treatment exposure.
1: Semiconfluent cultures were treated for 24 h with hemp EOs from CS male and female inflorescences (0.65 mg mL 1) and 10 M of ETO.
2: Cells treated with vehicle were included in all series.
3: The Comet assay was performed under alkaline conditions following the ABCAM protocol.
4: Briefly, after exposure to treatments, the cells were resuspended in 1 PBS and added to 75 L of molten (37 C) 0.5% low-melting-point agarose gel to achieve a cell concentration of 1  10 5 cells mL 1.
5: The agarose was pipetted onto the Comet slides.
6: Slides were stored in the dark at 4 C for 10 min before adding prechilled lysis buffer for 45 min at 4 C in the dark.
7: The slides were immersed in freshly prepared alkaline solution (0.25 M NaOH containing 0.1 M EDTA, pH 12.6) for 30 min at the same conditions.
8: Slides were then removed and washed twice with TBE buffer for 5 min.
9: Gel electrophoresis was performed at 1 V cm 1 for 20 min (running amperage 35 mA with the distance between the two electrodes of 25 cm).
10: The Comet slides were washed with 70% ethanol for 5 min and air-dried for 1 h at room temperature.
11: A total of 100 L of diluted SYBR Green solution was placed onto each dried agarose circle.
12: The slides were then read with a fluorescence microscope (LEIKA).
