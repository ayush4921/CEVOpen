<p>Cells were plated in six-well plates (3 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells well
 <sup>−1</sup>) one day before treatment exposure. Semiconfluent cultures were treated for 24 h with hemp EOs from CS male and female inflorescences (0.65 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) and 10 µM of ETO. Cells treated with vehicle were included in all series. The Comet assay was performed under alkaline conditions following the ABCAM protocol. Briefly, after exposure to treatments, the cells were resuspended in 1× PBS and added to 75 µL of molten (37 °C) 0.5% low-melting-point agarose gel to achieve a cell concentration of 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells mL
 <sup>−1</sup>. The agarose was pipetted onto the Comet slides. Slides were stored in the dark at 4 °C for 10 min before adding prechilled lysis buffer for 45 min at 4 °C in the dark. The slides were immersed in freshly prepared alkaline solution (0.25 M NaOH containing 0.1 µM EDTA, pH 12.6) for 30 min at the same conditions. Slides were then removed and washed twice with TBE buffer for 5 min. Gel electrophoresis was performed at 1 V cm
 <sup>−1</sup> for 20 min (running amperage 3–5 mA with the distance between the two electrodes of 25 cm). The Comet slides were washed with 70% ethanol for 5 min and air-dried for 1 h at room temperature. A total of 100 µL of diluted SYBR Green solution was placed onto each dried agarose circle. The slides were then read with a fluorescence microscope (LEIKA).
