 <sub>50</sub> values were obtained by nonlinear regression using GraphPad Prism version 5.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). The graphs related to the mortality effect of the EOs on larvae and pupae of 
 <italic>An. stephensi</italic> and 
 <italic>An. gambiae</italic>. Data were plotted using STATISTICA software version 6.0. The correlation between the mortality and the EOs doses was assessed using linear regression analysis (Fisher–Snedecor test) using GraphPad Prism version 8.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). For MTT, RT-PCR, and Elisa assay, the data presented represent the mean and standard deviation of at least two independent experiments. The statistical significance was determined by Student’s 
 <italic>t</italic>-test and by one-way ANOVA; *, # 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 or 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 (as described in the figure’s legends). The statistical analysis was performed using Prism 5.0a (Graph Pad).
