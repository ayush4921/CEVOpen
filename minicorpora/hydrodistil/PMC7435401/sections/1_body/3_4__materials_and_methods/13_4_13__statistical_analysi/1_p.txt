0: LC 50 values were obtained by nonlinear regression using GraphPad Prism version 5.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).
1: The graphs related to the mortality effect of the EOs on larvae and pupae of  An.
2: stephensi and  An.
3: gambiae.
4: Data were plotted using STATISTICA software version 6.0.
5: The correlation between the mortality and the EOs doses was assessed using linear regression analysis (FisherSnedecor test) using GraphPad Prism version 8.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).
6: For MTT, RT-PCR, and Elisa assay, the data presented represent the mean and standard deviation of at least two independent experiments.
7: The statistical significance was determined by Students  t-test and by one-way ANOVA; *, #  p< 0.01 or  p< 0.05 (as described in the figures legends).
8: The statistical analysis was performed using Prism 5.0a (Graph Pad).
