0: NEs were obtained through a high-energy method, by using a high-pressure homogenizer.
1: Briefly, different percentages (6%, 4%  w/ w) of CS female inflorescence EO or a 6% ( w/ w) of a binary mixture of EO and ethyl oleate (1:1 ratio) were added dropwise to a 4% ( w/ w1) of surfactant (Tween 80) aqueous solution under high-speed stirring (Ultraturrax T25 basic, IKA  Werke GmbH & Co.KG, Staufen, Germany) for 5 min at 9500 rpm.
2: The obtained emulsions were then subjected to the homogenization process by means of French Pressure Cell Press (American Instrument Company, AMINCO, MY, USA) for four cycles at the pressure of 130 MPa.
