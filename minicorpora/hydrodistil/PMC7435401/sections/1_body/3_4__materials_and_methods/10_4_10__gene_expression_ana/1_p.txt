0: Total RNA was extracted with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), and cDNA was synthesized using the High-Capacity cDNA Archive Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) according to the manufacturers instructions.
1: Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions (qRT-PCR) were performed with TaqMan Array (Thermo Fisher) using the iQ5 Multicolor Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).
2: The PCR parameters were 10 min at 95 C followed by 40 cycles at 95 C for 15 s and 60 C for 40 s. The relative amount of target mRNA was calculated by the 2 Ct method, using GAPDH as a housekeeping gene.
3: All samples were assayed in triplicates on the same plate.
4: Measurement of GAPDH levels was used to normalize mRNA contents, and target gene levels were calculated by the 2 Ct method.
5: The gene list is presented in  Figure 6.
