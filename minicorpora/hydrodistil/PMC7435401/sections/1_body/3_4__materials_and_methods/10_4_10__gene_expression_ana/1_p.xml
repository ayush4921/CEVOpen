<p>Total RNA was extracted with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), and cDNA was synthesized using the High-Capacity cDNA Archive Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions (qRT-PCR) were performed with TaqMan Array (Thermo Fisher) using the iQ5 Multicolor Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The PCR parameters were 10 min at 95 °C followed by 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 40 s. The relative amount of target mRNA was calculated by the 2
 <sup>−ΔΔCt</sup> method, using GAPDH as a housekeeping gene. All samples were assayed in triplicates on the same plate. Measurement of GAPDH levels was used to normalize mRNA contents, and target gene levels were calculated by the 2
 <sup>−ΔΔCt</sup> method. The gene list is presented in
