0: Three thousand cells per well were seeded in 96-well plates.
1: After one day of incubation, hemp EOs (from male and female inflorescence of CS) and vehicles were added, and six replicates were used for each treatment.
2: At the indicated time point, 24 h, cell viability was investigated by adding 0.8 mg mL 1 of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5 diphenil tethrazolium bromide MTT (Sigma Aldrich) to the media.
3: The reaction was given by mitochondrial reductase which changed MTT (tetrazolium salt) colour from yellow to purple, forming formazan crystal.
4: After 3 h, plates were centrifuged, the supernatant was removed, and the pellet of salt crystals was solubilised with 100 L well 1 of DMSO.
5: The absorbance of the sample against a background control (medium alone) was measured at 570 nm using an ELISA reader microliter plate (BioTek Instruments, Winooski, VT, USA).
