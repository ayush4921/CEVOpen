<p>Hydrodistillation (HD) was performed for dried samples of cv Felina 32 monoecious inflorescences and cv CS female inflorescences. In both cases, we used 2000 g of plant material soaked in a 20 L glass flask filled with 11 L of water that was heated by a mantle system Falc MA (Falc Instruments, Treviglio, Italy) for 4 h. The EOs were recovered by a glass Clevenger-type apparatus. In this case, the obtained EOs were kept in the dark glass vials in the fridge before chemical characterization and biological assays. The EO yield was calculated on a dry weight basis.</p>
