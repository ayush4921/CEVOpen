0: Visual inspection of formulations was done by a polarizing optical microscope (MT9000, Meiji Techno Co Ltd., Chikumazawa, Miyoshi machi, Iruma-gun, Saitama 354-0043, Japan) equipped with a 3 megapixel CMOS camera (Invenio 3S, DeltaPix, Denmark).
1: Particle size measurements were performed through dynamic light scattering (DLS) technique.
2: DLS analyses were carried out using a Zetasizer nanoS (Malvern Instruments, Worcestershire, UK) equipped with backscattered light detector working at 173.
3: Samples (1 mL) were inserted into disposable cuvettes and analyzed at 25 C, following a temperature equilibration time (180 s).
4: The analysis was performed at different time points: 0 day (t0), 1 month (t1), 3 months (t3), and 6 months (t6).
