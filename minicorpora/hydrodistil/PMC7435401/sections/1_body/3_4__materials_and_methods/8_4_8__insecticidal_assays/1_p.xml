<p>The larvicidal effect of the EOs was evaluated according to standard procedures established by the WHO [
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-25-03451" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Three different hemp EOs were analyzed: (i) Felina 32 dioecious inflorescence, (ii) CS female inflorescence, (iii) CS male inflorescence. For the treatment of mosquitoes, the EOs were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) 1:10. Twenty-five larvae L3 (third instar stage) and twenty-five pupae were placed in plastic cups containing water. Treatment was carried out using different dilutions of the three essential oils preparations: 50, 75, 100, and 125 ppm. Control groups were prepared adding pure breeding water or DMSO (200 ÂµL). Mortality of larvae and pupae was observed after 24 h. Three independent experiments were performed.
