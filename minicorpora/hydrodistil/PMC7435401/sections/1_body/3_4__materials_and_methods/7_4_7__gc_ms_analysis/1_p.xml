<p>The chemical composition of hemp EOs was analyzed through an Agilent 6890N GC-MS system coupled to a 5973N single quadrupole detector mass spectrometer. Separation was provided by a HP-5MS capillary column (5% phenylmethylpolysiloxane, 30 mL × 0.25 mm i.d., 0.1 µm f.t., Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The temperature program was as follows: 60 °C for 5 min, then 4 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup> up to 220 °C, finally 11 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup> to 280 °C, maintained for 15 min, for a total run time of 65 min. The temperature of the injector and detector was 280 °C. Helium (He) was the carrier gas, with a flow rate of 1 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup> and a 1:50 split ratio. The chromatograms were acquired in full scan in the range 29.0–400.0 uma, using electron-impact (EI, 70 eV) mode. Dilution 1:100 of essential oils in 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane was injected (2 µL) into the GC-MS system. The MSD ChemStation (Agilent, Version G1701DA D.01.00) and the NIST Mass Spectral Search Program were employed for the data analysis. The identification of the principal compounds was achieved by the correspondence of retention indices and mass spectra to those of ADAMS, NIST 17, FFNSC2, and WILEY 275 libraries. Furthermore, the analytical standards available in the laboratory (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy) were used for further confirmation. The relative peak area percentages were obtained by area normalization without using correction factors [
