0: The chemical composition of hemp EOs was analyzed through an Agilent 6890N GC-MS system coupled to a 5973N single quadrupole detector mass spectrometer.
1: Separation was provided by a HP-5MS capillary column (5% phenylmethylpolysiloxane, 30 mL  0.25 mm i.d., 0.1 m f.t., Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA).
2: The temperature program was as follows: 60 C for 5 min, then 4 C min 1 up to 220 C, finally 11 C min 1 to 280 C, maintained for 15 min, for a total run time of 65 min.
3: The temperature of the injector and detector was 280 C. Helium (He) was the carrier gas, with a flow rate of 1 mL min 1 and a 1:50 split ratio.
4: The chromatograms were acquired in full scan in the range 29.0400.0 uma, using electron-impact (EI, 70 eV) mode.
5: Dilution 1:100 of essential oils in  n-hexane was injected (2 L) into the GC-MS system.
6: The MSD ChemStation (Agilent, Version G1701DA D.01.00) and the NIST Mass Spectral Search Program were employed for the data analysis.
7: The identification of the principal compounds was achieved by the correspondence of retention indices and mass spectra to those of ADAMS, NIST 17, FFNSC2, and WILEY 275 libraries.
8: Furthermore, the analytical standards available in the laboratory (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy) were used for further confirmation.
9: The relative peak area percentages were obtained by area normalization without using correction factors [ 49].
