<p>In our EO samples, cannabidiol was detected in poor amounts in Felina 32 and CS female dry inflorescences (0.1 and 0.2%, respectively). In many other works, such as that by Novak et al. [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-25-03451" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], relatively consistent rates of cannabidiol (9.8â€“10.9%) were found in 
 <italic>C. sativa</italic> EOs. Other differences were noticed in the balance between the two main hemp volatile fractions, namely, monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, with the former being dominant in the EO chemical profiles obtained from female inflorescences of cv CS, and the latter representing the main fraction of the ones obtained from monoecious Felina 32 and CS male inflorescences.
