<p>Based on these results, we conclude that the type of cultivar (e.g., monoecious vs. dioecious), the status of the plant material (e.g., fresh vs. dry) and extraction technique (e.g., steam distillation vs. hydrodistillation) are key factors influencing the chemical profile of hemp EO. On this basis, we evaluated the biological potential, namely mosquitocidal, toxicological, and immunomodulatory effects of these EOs.</p>
