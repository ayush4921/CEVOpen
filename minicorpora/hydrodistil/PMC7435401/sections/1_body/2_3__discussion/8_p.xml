<p>The mortality of mosquitoes may be caused mainly by α-pinene, myrcene, terpinolene, (

 <italic>C. sativa</italic> EO studied by Bedini et al. [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-25-03451" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], which were revealed to be effective against the Asian tiger mosquito

 <xref rid="B3-molecules-25-03451" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], the toxicity of hemp EOs on 
 <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> was linked to the presence of α-pinene, myrcene, (
 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene, and terpinolene as the major compounds. (
 <italic>E</italic>)-Caryophyllene and α-humulene, the main sesquiterpenes of hemp EO, have shown notable mosquitocidal and acaricidal properties [
