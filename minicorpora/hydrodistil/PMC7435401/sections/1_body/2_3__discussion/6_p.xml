<p>Innovative methods to control the mosquito vector populations are strongly required [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-25-03451" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Larvae and pupae represent attractive targets for pesticides because these developmental stages are aquatic and breed in water. The employment of chemical compounds in the water sources (including drinking water), however, causes many risks to people and the environment, whereas natural and eco-friendly pesticides, especially those obtained from plants, are extremely promising [
