<p>As for Felina 32 EO, a previous work by Fiorini et al. [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-25-03451" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] confirmed that sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, followed by monoterpene hydrocarbons, were the main volatile groups characterizing this variety. Consistently, the EO obtained from the fresh inflorescences of cv Felina 32, which was characterized by Tabari et al. [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-25-03451" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], showed (
 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene and Î±-pinene as the predominant components.
