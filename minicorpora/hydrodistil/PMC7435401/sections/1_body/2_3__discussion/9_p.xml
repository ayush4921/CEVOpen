<p>To our knowledge, information on the anti-inflammatory effect of hemp EOs is very limited. On the other hand, some authors [

However, in this study, we demonstrated that the CBD-free hemp EOs did not induce an inflammatory condition, but, additionally, were able to revert an inflammatory condition, reducing the release of the cytokine induced by ETO, on skin cell lines, suggesting that they could be safely used by operators. Among the various hemp EO constituents detected, (
