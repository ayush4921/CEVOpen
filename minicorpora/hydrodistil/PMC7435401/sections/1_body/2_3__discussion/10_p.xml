<p>Despite hemp EOs showed potential as ingredients of botanical insecticides, their widespread use should be restricted due to the poor physicochemical properties of EOs in general. In fact, they show several limitations, i.e., high volatility, thermal decomposition, low water solubility, and stability issues [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-25-03451" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In this respect, nanotechnology could support the exploitation of EOs through their encapsulation into stable formulations, i.e., NEs, overcoming such limitations [
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-25-03451" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Moreover, being biphasic colloidal systems, NEs allow the dispersity of the EOs into an aqueous medium, a very important property for a pesticide. Thus, hemp EOs based NEs were prepared. At the end of screening on the quali/quantitive composition of the system, 3% of hemp EO was encapsulated into a nanoemulsified system to assure its stability over time. Although several studies reported an increased bioavailability of EOs encapsulated into nanoformulations, further investigations about the insecticidal effectiveness of hemp EO-based NEs are required.
