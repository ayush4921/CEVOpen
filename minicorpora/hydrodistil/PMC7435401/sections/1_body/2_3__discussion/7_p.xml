<p>The EOs from hemp cultivars have been studied as potential biopesticides in crop protection or for the control of mosquito and fly vectors [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-25-03451" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In previous studies, hemp EOs have shown toxicity against mosquitoes and snails [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-25-03451" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-25-03451" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,

 <xref rid="B41-molecules-25-03451" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Our studies demonstrated the strong toxicity of three EOs of hemp (CS and Felina varieties) against larvae and pupae of the main malaria vectors 
 <italic>An. stephensi</italic> and 
 <italic>An. gambiae</italic>, in Asia and Africa, respectively. The lower LC
 <sub>50</sub> of pupae compared to larvae could be due to the different metabolic traits of these developmental stages of the mosquitoes. Our results demonstrated that the analyzed hemp EOs are highly active against both preadult stages, with LC
 <sub>50</sub> values lower than 80 ppm. This value represents an important threshold to consider a natural product as a valuable ingredient for the formulation of botanical insecticides [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-25-03451" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The LC
 <sub>50</sub> values found in this study are lower than the average of those of many EOs extracted from plants [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-25-03451" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], with the advantage of using an industrial waste product.
