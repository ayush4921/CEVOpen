<p>In the present work, we investigated the potential application of the EOs obtained from industrial hemp as mosquitocidal agents. The three EOs tested, coming from different cultivars and plant parts, showed efficacy in killing the two malaria vectors, 
 <italic>An. gambiae</italic> and 
 <italic>An. stephensi</italic>. The LC
 <sub>50</sub> values found in this study are, on average, lower than those of many plant EOs, with the advantage of using an industrial waste product. Notably, this work highlighted that the male inflorescence, which is usually discarded during the industrial hemp processing, may be a sustainable source of larvicidal compounds. The bioactivity observed in the larvicidal assays may be entirely attributed to the terpenoid fraction of the EOs since the cannabinoid one was almost absent. Moreover, the toxicological assays and Comet assays put in evidence the safety of the hemp EOs at certain doses on human cell lines, whereas the gene expression analysis, together with the ELISA, showed, for the first time, their anti-inflammatory potential and safety profile. This result may open new avenues of use for hemp EOs in pharmaceuticals and cosmeceuticals. For this reason, stable nanoemulsions were developed to guarantee better water dispersity and chemical stability over time, while reducing the high volatility of EOs, making them ready-to-use products to be further investigated as larvicidal and anti-inflammatory agents.
