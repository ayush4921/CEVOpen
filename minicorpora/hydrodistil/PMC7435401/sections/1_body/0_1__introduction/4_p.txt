0: The need for sustainability of malaria control strategies and growing insecticide-resistance are inducing the exploration of new natural pesticides.
1: In this context, plant EOs and their bioactive molecules can constitute a potential weapon against insect vectors and are considered as effective larvicides with fewer mosquito resistance issues [ 15, 16].
2: Moreover, they are biodegradable and low-cost products that could be used in malaria control programs [ 17].
3: Among various crops available as industrial sources of EO, hemp,  Cannabis sativa L. (Cannabaceae), has recently received growing interest for its potential use as a botanical insecticide.
4: Indeed, the plant inflorescences have developed as a natural weapon against phytophagous insects, secreting essential secondary metabolites such as cannabinoids and volatile terpenes [ 18, 19].
5: In previous reports,  C. sativa EO proved to be effective against aphids, houseflies, and ticks [ 2, 3, 20].
6: Moreover, this EO proved to be eco-friendly since no toxicity was detected on non-target organisms such as earthworms and ladybirds [ 3].
7: Notably, the possible development of hemp EO-based insecticides would enjoy the following advantages: (i) lack of similar products on the market; (ii) low cost of raw material (frequently as a byproduct); (iii) availability of agricultural land for plant cultivation over the world; (iv) increasing demand for eco-friendly and safe products; (v) possibility to split the end products into other fields, such as cosmetics and pharmaceuticals [ 1].
