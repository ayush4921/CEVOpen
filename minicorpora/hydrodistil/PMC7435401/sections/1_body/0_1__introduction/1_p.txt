0: The cultivation of hemp ( Cannabis sativa L.) in the European Union is steadily increasing, thanks to the community policies aimed at improving low-impact agricultural techniques and at valorizing the agricultural and quality productions.
1: Notably, in Italy, around 4000 ha are cultivated with hemp by farms, for an estimated income of about 40 million euros.
2: In this scenario, it is very important to develop innovative products from this multipurpose crop.
3: In this regard, the hemp essential oil (EO), which is a mixture of volatile compounds produced in the bract glandular hairs of the plant inflorescences, is a niche product that is gaining interest by companies for its possible application in different fields, such as organic agriculture, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and botanical insecticides [ 1].
4: Hemp EO is mostly made up by monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, with a lower contribution of the cannabinoid fraction [ 2, 3].
5: Overall, plant EOs have shown potential to be used for their antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, insecticidal, and parasiticidal properties [ 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].
6: In this respect, hemp EO has hitherto received little attention.
