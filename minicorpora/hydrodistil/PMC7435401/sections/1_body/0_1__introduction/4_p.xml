<p>The need for sustainability of malaria control strategies and growing insecticide-resistance are inducing the exploration of new natural pesticides. In this context, plant EOs and their bioactive molecules can constitute a potential weapon against insect vectors and are considered as effective larvicides with fewer mosquito resistance issues [

 <xref rid="B16-molecules-25-03451" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Moreover, they are biodegradable and low-cost products that could be used in malaria control programs [

 <italic>Cannabis sativa</italic> L. (Cannabaceae), has recently received growing interest for its potential use as a botanical insecticide. Indeed, the plant inflorescences have developed as a natural weapon against phytophagous insects, secreting essential secondary metabolites such as cannabinoids and volatile terpenes [

 <xref rid="B19-molecules-25-03451" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In previous reports, 
 <italic>C. sativa</italic> EO proved to be effective against aphids, houseflies, and ticks [

 <xref rid="B20-molecules-25-03451" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Moreover, this EO proved to be eco-friendly since no toxicity was detected on non-target organisms such as earthworms and ladybirds [

Notably, the possible development of hemp EO-based insecticides would enjoy the following advantages: (i) lack of similar products on the market; (ii) low cost of raw material (frequently as a byproduct); (iii) availability of agricultural land for plant cultivation over the world; (iv) increasing demand for eco-friendly and safe products; (v) possibility to split the end products into other fields, such as cosmetics and pharmaceuticals [
