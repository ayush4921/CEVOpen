0: The preclinical cell model for assessing safety and toxicity of the chemical and plant-derived topical insect repellents and insecticides have been applied using human keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts.
1: The skin responds to a variety of physical stimuli through modulation of specific pathways.
2: The epidermis is mainly constituted of keratinocytes, which represent 95% of the epidermal cells and are involved in the initiation and perpetuation of skin inflammatory and immunological responses [ 21, 22].
3: Moreover, fibroblasts strictly interact with keratinocytes and are involved in wound healing [ 23].
4: Keratinocytes, as well as fibroblasts, release several proinflammatory mediators, including interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha), under inflammation stimuli, and several studies have indicated that etoposide (ETO) triggers cytokine production in human cell lines in vitro [ 24, 25].
