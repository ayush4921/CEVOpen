0: On this basis, the main objective of this study was to verify if the EOs obtained from inflorescences of hemp may be of interest for the manufacturing of botanical insecticides, as well as their safety profile for operators.
1: For the purpose, we selected two different hemp varieties, namely, Felina 32 and Carmagnola CS, and distilled the EOs from fresh and dry material and from monoecious, male, and female inflorescences using two different extraction techniquessteam distillation (SD) and hydrodistillation (HD)in order to verify whether the variability of the chemical profiles may impact on the biological activities.
2: The potential toxic effects of the selected hemp EOs were assessed on larvae and pupae of  An.
3: stephensi and  An.
4: gambiae mosquitoes.
5: Secondly, we investigated the potential pro- or anti-inflammatory effect of hemp EOs, in order to evaluate their safe use for operators, by analyzing the proinflammatory cytokines release in ETO-treated human keratinocytes and fibroblasts.
6: Finally, in order to reach a real-world application of hemp EOs, a preliminary evaluation of their encapsulation into nanoemulsions (NEs) has been performed.
7: Nanoencapsulation helps to overcome the poor physicochemical stability, limited water solubility, high volatility, and thermal decomposition that usually characterize EOs [ 26].
8: Thus, the possibility to encapsulate EOs and plant extracts inside NEs ensures stability and protection of components, an increase of biological activity, and an improved solubility.
9: For these reasons, the hemp EO NEs have been successfully developed, characterized, and their stability over time evaluated.
