<p>The preclinical cell model for assessing safety and toxicity of the chemical and plant-derived topical insect repellents and insecticides have been applied using human keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts. The skin responds to a variety of physical stimuli through modulation of specific pathways. The epidermis is mainly constituted of keratinocytes, which represent 95% of the epidermal cells and are involved in the initiation and perpetuation of skin inflammatory and immunological responses [

Keratinocytes, as well as fibroblasts, release several proinflammatory mediators, including interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha), under inflammation stimuli, and several studies have indicated that etoposide (ETO) triggers cytokine production in human cell lines in vitro [
