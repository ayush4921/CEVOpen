<p>The cultivation of hemp (
 <italic>Cannabis sativa</italic> L.) in the European Union is steadily increasing, thanks to the community policies aimed at improving low-impact agricultural techniques and at valorizing the agricultural and quality productions. Notably, in Italy, around 4000 ha are cultivated with hemp by farms, for an estimated income of about 40 million euros. In this scenario, it is very important to develop innovative products from this multipurpose crop. In this regard, the hemp essential oil (EO), which is a mixture of volatile compounds produced in the bract glandular hairs of the plant inflorescences, is a niche product that is gaining interest by companies for its possible application in different fields, such as organic agriculture, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and botanical insecticides [
