  <p>Doseâ€“response curve of insecticidal activity of 
   <italic>C. sativa</italic> essential oils (EOs) on 
   <italic>An. gambiae</italic> preadults. Larvae (
   <bold>A</bold>) and pupae (
   <bold>B</bold>) were exposed for 24 h to different dilutions of EOs (50, 75, 100, and 125 ppm). The level of susceptibility of both larvae and pupae to the EOs was found to be statistically significant (as reported in figure). EO samples, Felina 32 inflorescence; CS female inflorescence; CS male inflorescence.
