 <caption> Transcriptional modulation of cytokines genes in HaCaT ( A) and NHF A12 ( B) cell lines. Cell lines treated with hemp EOs from female and male inflorescences of cv CS (0.65 mg mL âˆ’1) alone or in combination with ETO (0.01 mM). Gene expression was represented as relative expression compared to GAPDH. * p &lt; 0.05 vs vehicle, # p &lt; 0.05 vs ETO. </caption>
