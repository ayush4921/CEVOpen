<p>The main components of the essential oils isolated from chamomile grown alone and infested with field dodder are presented in 
 <xref rid="plants-09-01286-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. Chromatograms are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-09-01286">Supplementary Materials (Figures S3 and S4)</xref>. Twenty-three components were identified in both essential oils, and they accounted for 99.91 and 99.90% (

 <italic>w</italic>) of total oil obtained from noninfested and infested plants, respectively. Considering oil density (0.91 g/mL for both oil) and yields (%,

 <xref rid="plants-09-01286-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), the identified compounds made up 0.45 and 0.18% (
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic>) of noninfested and infested chamomile biomass used for essential oil isolation, respectively. With an exception of (
 <italic>E</italic>)-dendrolasin, which was detected only in noninfested chamomile essential oil, and 1,4-dimethyl-7-(1-methylethyl)-azulen-2-ol found only in oil extracted from infested chamomile, all other components were identified in both oils tested. These results indicate that chamomile plants metabolize some different components, depending on field dodder infestation. In this regard, literature data on the chemical composition of chamomile essential oils originating from Serbia vary considerably, as well as in comparison with our present findings. For example, chamomile oils have been reported to be mainly rich in (
 <italic>E</italic>)-β-farnesene [

 <xref rid="B53-plants-09-01286" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], and α-bisabolene oxide A and (
 <italic>Z</italic>)-en-yn-dicycloether [
 <xref rid="B54-plants-09-01286" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Differences are probably due to different geo-climatic conditions in those studies. Šalamon et al. [
 <xref rid="B12-plants-09-01286" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] analyzed essential oils from chamomile originating from various parts of Iran and found that the plants were grown under conditions of mild winters, very humid and hot summers and produced oil rich in α-bisabolol, while those grown under conditions of arid weather had a high content of α-bisabolol oxide A.
