<p>Field dodder affects the growth and reproduction of its hosts more or less severely, depending on the infested plant species. Stressed plants may be surprisingly good hosts, even when they are small, because they have metabolite reserves that are more concentrated and not allocated to growth, and also due to their accumulation of additional carbon- and nitrogen-containing compounds [

The changeable yield and main components of essential oils from infested peppermint and chamomile plants, compared to noninfested, may therefore be considered as the host response to parasitism, which mostly leads to the accumulation of nutrients as heightened metabolism creates a defense mechanism in the host.
