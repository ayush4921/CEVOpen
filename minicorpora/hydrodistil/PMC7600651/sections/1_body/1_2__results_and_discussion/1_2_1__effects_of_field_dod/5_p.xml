<p>A comparison of composition data for peppermint essential oils obtained from previous reports in Serbia and our present findings revealed a fairly good consistency. Menthone and menthol were generally found to be the main components of peppermint essential oils [

 <xref rid="B40-plants-09-01286" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], while the peppermint oils were also rich in menthyl acetate in previous experiments in Serbia [

 <xref rid="B34-plants-09-01286" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="B41-plants-09-01286" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], but were not abundant in the plants of our present research regardless their field dodder infestation status. Field dodder infestation affected the content of other minor oil constituents, reducing the content of pulegone by 67%. Contrary to our findings, Santoro et al. [
 <xref rid="B13-plants-09-01286" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] revealed that pulegone was 30% higher in the essential oil of peppermint plants exposed to volatile organic compounds from 
 <italic>P. fluorescens</italic>. Furthermore, these authors found that menthofuran was reduced to 0.8%, as compared to 1.16% in controls, while in the present study, the content of this compound increased by 5% in the oil extracted from field dodder-infested peppermint plants. Guo et al. [
 <xref rid="B14-plants-09-01286" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] showed that colonization of 
 <italic>Trichoderma viride</italic> fungi in peppermint roots had an impact on the composition of essential oil, increasing the percentage of menthol, menthone, and pulegone, and decreasing menthofuran compared to control plants. Sharma et al. [
 <xref rid="B42-plants-09-01286" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] revealed alterations in the lipid composition in host plants (
 <italic>Medicago sativa</italic> L., 
 <italic>Helianthus annuus</italic> L., 
 <italic>Pisum sativum</italic> L. and 
 <italic>Lantana camara</italic> L.) upon infestation by 
 <italic>Cuscuta reflexa</italic>. Dodder infestation significantly increased the total lipid level of the hosts and the increase was mainly due to enhancement in the neutral lipid fraction, while the total phospholipid levels were not affected as a result of the infestation by this parasitic weed. In addition, Mishra and Sanwal [
 <xref rid="B43-plants-09-01286" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] revealed changes in the lipid composition of susceptible varieties of 
 <italic>Brassica juncea</italic> seed oil upon infection by 
 <italic>C. reflexa</italic>. The infestation by dodder resulted in a decrease in oil content and the composition of the oil of susceptible mustard varieties became poorer. A significant increase in free fatty acids and free sterols and decrease in total neutral glycerides of oil were observed. Sarić-Krsmanović et al. [
 <xref rid="B32-plants-09-01286" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] showed that field dodder infestation affected the main components of the essential oil isolated from fennel plants by reducing the content of trans-anethole by 67.0% and increasing the content of fenchone by 26.5%, and methyl chavicol by 19.6%.
