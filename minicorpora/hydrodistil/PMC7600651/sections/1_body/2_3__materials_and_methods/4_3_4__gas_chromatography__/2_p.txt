0: To determine the retention indices (RI), a mixture of n-alkanes (C6-C28) was analyzed by the GCMS under identical conditions as the essential oils.
1: Identification of the essential oil components was performed using both the Wiley 7.0 mass spectral library and the obtained RI data, while quantitative data were expressed as area percent obtained by the GCMS analysis.
2: The obtained RI data were compared to those in available literature [ 38].
3: The data were used as an additional tool to confirm MS findings.
