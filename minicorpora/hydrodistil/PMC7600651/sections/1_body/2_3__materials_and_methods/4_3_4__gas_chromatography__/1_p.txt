0: Chemical composition of the tested essential oils was analyzed by a Varian CP-3800 gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a split/splitless injector, DB-5MS column (30 m, 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 m film thickness), and Saturn 2200 mass spectrometer (MS) as a detection device.
1: Injector temperatures were set to 250 C, and the ion trap and transfer line temperatures were set to 250 and 280 C, respectively.
2: Helium was used as the carrier gas and its flow rate was 1 mL/min.
3: The column temperature was linearly programmed to rise from 50 to 250 C at a 4 C/min rate before holding for 15 min.
4: The mass detector was operated in the electron impact (EI) mode (70 eV; 40600  m/ z range).
5: The essential oil solutions in n-hexane (1%) were injected in the split mode (1:20).
