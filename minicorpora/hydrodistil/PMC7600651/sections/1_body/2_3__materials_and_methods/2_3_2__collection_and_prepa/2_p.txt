0: The samples of aromatic plants were collected at the flowering stages as follows: chamomile at the fully flowering stage (65 BBCH, 4th week of May 2017) while field dodder was at the vegetative growing stage; peppermint in the early flowering stage (6061 BBCH, 3rd week of July 2017) while field dodder was at the flowering stage.
1: The density of peppermint was 45 plants per quadrat frame.
2: The density of chamomile was 2528 plants per quadrat frame.
3: Field dodder was widespread in small oases and aggregated on stems and leaves of peppermint plants, and on stems and leaf petioles of chamomile plants, forming a cover over the aromatic plants.
4: Measurements relating to parasitization percentage of field dodder were carried out in the field plots.
5: Based on visual assessment (percentage of area in trial covered by field dodder), the infestation was moderate, in chamomile plots by 40%, while peppermint plots were infested by 55%.
