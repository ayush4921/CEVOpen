0: Plants from each quadrat were cut out just above the ground and samples were brought to the laboratory.
1: In the next step, field dodder plants were manually and completely removed from the stems and leaves of infested plants.
2: Fresh plant material was placed in thin layers in the shade of a draughty place, for the material to dry at the temperature of 2022 C for 30 days until reaching humidity levels of 1012%.
3: After being dried, each individual biomass of infested and noninfested plants was measured, and expressed as means in g/plant.
4: Dry plant material was packed in paper bags and kept in a dry and cool place.
5: After field dodder was separated from the stems and leaves of infested plants, the samples were placed in a drying oven at 60 C for 72 h until a constant weight was reached.
6: The dry weight of plant biomass was measured and expressed as means in g/m 2.
