0: The main weed species in the peppermint field were the annuals  Artemisia vulgaris L.,  Chenopodium album L.,  Consolida regalis S.F.Gray,  Hibiscus trionum L.,  Senecio vernalis W. et K.,  Veronica hederifolia L. and  Veronica persica Poir.
1: and perennials  Convolvulus arvensis L. and  Sorghum halepense (L.) Pers.
2: The most abundant species was  C. album with more than 8 plants/m 2.
3: The other weeds were counted in fewer than 5 plants/m 2.
4: In the chamomile field, the main weed species were the annuals  Anthemis arvensis L.,  Chenopodium album L.,  Consolida regalis S.F.Gray,  Fumaria officinalis L.,  Galium aparine L.,  Senecio vernalis W. et K. and  Veronica persica Poir., and the perennials  Agropyrum repens (L.) Beauv.,  Cirsium arvense (L.) Scop.
5: and  Sorghum halepense (L.) Pers.
6: The most abundant species was  A. arvensis with more than 12 plants/m 2.
7: The other weeds were counted in fewer than 4 plants/m 2.
8: In the spring of 2017, the spontaneous appearance of field dodder seedlings was also noted in both fields.
9: Additional tests (seedling emergence) revealed that field dodder seeds were introduced into the fields with compost.
10: Over the next few weeks, field dodder infestation was monitored.
11: The autotrophic weeds, in stage from cotyledons to 24 true leaves, were manually removed from all plots in the peppermint and chamomile fields.
12: Weed management is important because weeds and crops grow under competition for light, space, soil moisture and nutrients.
13: In addition, the presence of autotrophic weeds in crops infested with field dodder can increase the degree of infestation with this parasitic plant, playing the role of intermediated host.
14: Therefore, manual weeding was extended until the end of the experiment.
