 <p>Edible films, as novel degradable materials in food packaging, play an important role in removing consumers' concerns about environmental pollution and food contaminations. Carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC)–gelatin (G) edible films with the ratio 4 to 1 was selected as the optimal film based on physical, mechanical, and physicochemical findings. Then, the effects of 0, 300, 450, and 600 ppm 
  <italic>Dianthus barbatus</italic> essential oil (DbE) on water vapor permeability, tensile strength, elongation at break, water solubility, glass transition temperature, color, oxygen permeability, and antimicrobial activities on the optimal film were investigated. CMC: G (4:1) containing 600 ppm DbE as the antibacterial–antioxidant film was the best formulae (

  <italic>A. flavus</italic> (PTCC‐5004), 
  <italic>A. parasiticus</italic> (PTCC‐5286), and 
  <italic>A. parasiticus</italic> (PTCC‐5018) on pistachios for 6 months.
