 <p>Edible films, as novel degradable materials in food packaging, play an important role to removing consumers' concerns about environmental pollution and food contaminations. Carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC)–gelatin (G) edible films with the ratio 4 to 1 containing 600 ppm Dianthus barbatus essential oil as antibacterial‐antioxidant film was the best formulae (

The developed edible film can be used as a biodegradable, low‐cost and high‐performance packaging in the food industry to improve the quality, shelf life, safety, and reduce waste and lost from food.
