<p>The data presented in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn31413-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref> showed that b* value increased significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) with increasing the DbE concentration. So, the F9 and F6 had the highest and lowest b* value, respectively. b* value indicates a yellow‐blue color and a positive b* value indicated that the formulae had a yellow tint. By increasing the concentration of DbE, the brightness and redness of the developed films decreased and their yellowness increased due to the yellow nature of the DbE. Also, a* and L* values of the developed films decreased significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05).
