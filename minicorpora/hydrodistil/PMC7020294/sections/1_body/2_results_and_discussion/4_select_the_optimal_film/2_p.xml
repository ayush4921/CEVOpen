<p>The optimally developed film was selected using Design‐Expert software version 7 (DX7) (Stat‐Ease Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) and a D‐Optimal design. Coefficients between − 2 and + 2 were given to the physical properties, WVP, and mechanical variables based on their importance. Nieto (Nieto, 
 <xref rid="fsn31413-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>) reported that selecting the best formulae depends on the purposes such as good mechanical strength to prevent tensions during transport, properties of inhibitory to gases and moisture, high flexibility, adaptation to the shape of foodstuff without fracture, and easily used as a coating. The obtained results showed that the film formulated with CMC and G in the ratio 4 to 1 (F4) was the most significantly appropriate (
