<p>As shown in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn31413-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>, the increase of DbE concentration resulted in a significant decrease in TS and an increase in the ELB (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) (Aguirre, Borneo, &amp; Leon, 
 <xref rid="fsn31413-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Sánchez‐González et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31413-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). F6 showed the highest TS and the lowest ELB and F9 showed the lowest TS and the highest ELB, which is in agreement with the findings of Aguirre et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31413-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). The addition of essential oils changed mechanical properties of developed films by the degradation of the film matrix due to changes in the molecular level (Chen &amp; Lai, 
 <xref rid="fsn31413-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>), their oily nature (Sánchez‐González et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31413-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>) or as a polymer emollient (Aguirre et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31413-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). The essential oils weaken the film's inner bonds and increase the flexibility and mobility of polymer chains (Aguirre et al.,
