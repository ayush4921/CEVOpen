<p>According to the results shown in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn31413-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>, the WVP decreased with increasing the concentration of DbE in formulae (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Film‐free DbE (F6) and the film containing 600 ppm of DbE (F9) had the highest and the lowest permeability, respectively (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), which is consistent with the findings of Sánchez‐González, Vargas, Gonzalez‐Martinez, Chiralt, and Chafer (
 <xref rid="fsn31413-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>) and Pérez‐Gago and Rhim (
 <xref rid="fsn31413-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). Sánchez‐González, Chiralt, Gonzalez‐Martinez, and Cháfer (
 <xref rid="fsn31413-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>) reported that adding 3% of bergamot essential oil to chitosan film resulted in a 50% reduction in WVP, due to the increased hydrophobicity of the film containing essential oil.
