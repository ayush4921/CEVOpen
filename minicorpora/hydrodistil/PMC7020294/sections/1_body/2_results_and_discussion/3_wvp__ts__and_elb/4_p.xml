<p>The interaction between molecular chains of G is high and leads to high TS. The effect of G on TS was also reported by Park (
 <xref rid="fsn31413-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">1999</xref>), who investigated on methylcellulose and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose films. Mohanty et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31413-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>) and Chen and Lai (
 <xref rid="fsn31413-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>) reported that films developed from CMC had a high TS and G yielded ELB reduction significantly (
