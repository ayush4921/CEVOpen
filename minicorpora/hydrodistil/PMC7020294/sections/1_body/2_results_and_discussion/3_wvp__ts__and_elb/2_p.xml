<p>Films used for food packaging should have low WVP to prevent the exchange of moisture between the food product and the environment. Biodegradable films have poor resistance to moisture due to their hydrophilic properties. WVP decreased when G was combined with the CMC due to their interaction, which leads to an unstable spiral and a more compact structure of the produced film. As shown in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn31413-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>, an increase in the level of CMC significantly yielded a WVP reduction (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). F1 (CMC: G (0:5)) had the highest WVP because of the highest level of G compared with the other formulae (
