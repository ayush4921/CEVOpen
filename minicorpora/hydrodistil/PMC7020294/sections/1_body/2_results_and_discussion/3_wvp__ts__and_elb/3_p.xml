<p>The addition of CMC decreased TS significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) and subsequently increased flexibility, because of the formation of strong hydrogen bonds between the CMC chains. The mechanical properties of films depend on the distribution, density of intermolecular, and interactions in the film network. Films of flexibility are required to withstand tensions and strains applied in various applications. Mohanty et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31413-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>) found that films produced from CMC are highly flexible and robust.
