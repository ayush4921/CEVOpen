<p>The amount of oxidation during 6 months was lower in coated pistachios, which means that the developed films could reduce the oxidation of pistachios to lower than the allowed threshold (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Oxidation rate in coated pistachios was lower during the time which means that developed films were able to reduce the oxidation rate of pistachio. Increasing the concentration of DbE in developed films yielded a slight slope in pistachio oxidation during storage. Bonilla, Atares, Vargas, and Chiralt (
 <xref rid="fsn31413-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>)) reported that G edible coating effectively influenced the oxidation rate, due to the good inhibitory effect of protein coatings such as G against oxygen penetration. The findings of Vanaei, Sedaghat, Abbaspour, Kaviani, and Azarbad (
 <xref rid="fsn31413-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>) showed that the use of aloe vera alone is not a good coating for pistachio conservation, but the film containing chitosan 0.5% is more suitable for pistachio conservation against oxygen penetration.
