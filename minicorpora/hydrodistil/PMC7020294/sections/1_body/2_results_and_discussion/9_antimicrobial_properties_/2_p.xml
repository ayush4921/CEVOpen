<p>The inhibitory activity of developed films was measured based on measurements of composed halo diameter around the disk‐shaped film. As shown in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn31413-tbl-0005" ref-type="table">5</xref>, the diameter of the inhibition zone of F6 was zero which showed no antimicrobial activity. According to the diameter of the inhibitory zone, the highest and the lowest antimicrobial activity of the DbE were against 
 <italic>A. parasiticus</italic> (PTCC‐5286) and 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> (PTCC‐5004), respectively.
