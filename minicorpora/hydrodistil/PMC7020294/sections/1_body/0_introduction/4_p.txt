0: Carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) is used in the packaging industry as a viscosity enhancer and bonding agent.
1: CMC feature for film creation in the food industry is due to its transparency solute, water binding, and viscosity properties (Tongdeesoontorn, Mauer, Wongruong, Sriburi, & Rachtanapun,  2011).
2: Prepared films with this polymer are usually good barrier against gases with intermediate to good mechanical properties but are vulnerable to moisture (Biswal & Singh,  2004; Jahit, Nazmi, Isa, & Sarbon,  2016).
3: Despite the availability and low cost of CMC, the main problem of CMC coatings is its relatively weak inhibition against water vapor (Yoo & Krochta,  2011).
4: The presence of essential oil in formulations of edible films is caused stabilization of phenolic componds and has reduced surface contamination of food through the gradual release of antimicrobial componds (Buonocore et al.,  2003).
5: Chouhan, Sharma, and Sanjay Guleria ( 2017) reported that extract penetrates into lipid membranes and mitochondrial structure of bacteria and mold caused disruption in cellular lipid and subsequently leakage of critical molecules and ions from their cells and impaired electron motor pump.
