<p>Carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) is used in the packaging industry as a viscosity enhancer and bonding agent. CMC feature for film creation in the food industry is due to its transparency solute, water binding, and viscosity properties (Tongdeesoontorn, Mauer, Wongruong, Sriburi, &amp; Rachtanapun, 
 <xref rid="fsn31413-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). Prepared films with this polymer are usually good barrier against gases with intermediate to good mechanical properties but are vulnerable to moisture (Biswal &amp; Singh,

 <xref rid="fsn31413-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Despite the availability and low cost of CMC, the main problem of CMC coatings is its relatively weak inhibition against water vapor (Yoo &amp; Krochta,

 <xref rid="fsn31413-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>) reported that extract penetrates into lipid membranes and mitochondrial structure of bacteria and mold caused disruption in cellular lipid and subsequently leakage of critical molecules and ions from their cells and impaired electron motor pump.
