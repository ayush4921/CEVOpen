0: Mechanical properties of the developed films, including tensile strength also called as tensile stress (TS) expressed in MPa and elongation at break also as called strain (ELB) reported as a percentage relative to comparison flexibility of films (Tabari,  2018), were determined according to Dashipour et al.
1: ( 2015) with some adjustments using an Instron Universal Testing Machine (model Zwick) according to the ASTMD8822002.
2: The developed films were cut in 2  7 cm pieces and equilibrated at 25C and 50% RH, and then fixed between the two jaws with an initial distance of 40 mm, and the crosshead speed was set at 10 mm/min and 500 N load cell.
