<p>Mechanical properties of the developed films, including tensile strength also called as tensile stress (TS) expressed in MPa and elongation at break also as called strain (ELB) reported as a percentage relative to comparison flexibility of films (Tabari, 
 <xref rid="fsn31413-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>), were determined according to Dashipour et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31413-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>) with some adjustments using an Instron Universal Testing Machine (model Zwick) according to the ASTM‐D882‐2002. The developed films were cut in 2 × 7 cm pieces and equilibrated at 25°C and 50% RH, and then fixed between the two jaws with an initial distance of 40 mm, and the crosshead speed was set at 10 mm/min and 500 N load cell.
