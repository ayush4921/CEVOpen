<p>Δm: weight loss per cup (g); X: film thickness (mm); A: area of exposure to the cup (7.06 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> m
 <sup>2</sup>); Δt: time (s); Δp: the partial pressure difference was 100% (kPa), the RH inside the cup was 100% and the outside of the cup was 0%, which caused a slight partial pressure of 3,179 Pa between the outside and inside of the cup.
