<p>WVP was determined using the standard ASTM‐E0096‐005 method. Circular cups with an average diameter of 3 cm and depth of 3.5 cm containing 8 ml of distilled water were sealed by the developed films with rubber gaskets, clips, and grease. Each cup was placed inside a desiccator with silica gel and was weighed every 12 hr (using a digital scale with a precision of 0.0001), and water vapor transport was determined by the weight gain of the cup.</p>
