0: m: weight loss per cup (g); X: film thickness (mm); A: area of exposure to the cup (7.06  10 4 m 2); t: time (s); p: the partial pressure difference was 100% (kPa), the RH inside the cup was 100% and the outside of the cup was 0%, which caused a slight partial pressure of 3,179 Pa between the outside and inside of the cup.
