<p>Oxygen permeability was measured by the indirect method (Ou, Wang, Tang, Huang, &amp; Jackson, 
 <xref rid="fsn31413-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>). Fresh and antioxidant‐free sunflower oil was used as a control, and its peroxide value was measured. Wineglasses were filled with sunflower oil, covered with developed film, and stored at 25 ± 2°C and 75% relative humidity for 15 days. The peroxide value (PV) of the pistachios uncoated and coated with edible films formulated containing different concentrations of DbE during 6 months of storage was determined by sodium thiosulfate titration and was calculated using the following equation:
