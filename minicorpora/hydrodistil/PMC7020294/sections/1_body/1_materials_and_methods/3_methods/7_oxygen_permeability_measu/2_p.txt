0: Oxygen permeability was measured by the indirect method (Ou, Wang, Tang, Huang, & Jackson,  2005).
1: Fresh and antioxidantfree sunflower oil was used as a control, and its peroxide value was measured.
2: Wineglasses were filled with sunflower oil, covered with developed film, and stored at 25  2C and 75% relative humidity for 15 days.
3: The peroxide value (PV) of the pistachios uncoated and coated with edible films formulated containing different concentrations of DbE during 6 months of storage was determined by sodium thiosulfate titration and was calculated using the following equation: (6)Peroxide Valuemeq O2kg-1=VNM1000
