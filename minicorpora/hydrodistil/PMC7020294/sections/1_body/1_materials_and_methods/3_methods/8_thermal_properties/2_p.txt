0: Glass transition temperature (Tg) measurement was performed using Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC60, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) according to Coronado Jorge et al.
1: ( 2015) and Bonilla, Bittante, and Sobral ( 2017) with some adjustments.
2: About 2 mg of developed films were placed in hermetically sealed aluminum pans and heated from  100 C to + 200C at a heating rate of 10C/min, after cooling with liquid nitrogen as a cryogenic.
3: Tg was obtained from the temperature fluctuation point of the temperature.
