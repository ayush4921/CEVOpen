 <xref rid="fsn31413-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>) with some adjustments. About 2 mg of developed films were placed in hermetically sealed aluminum pans and heated from − 100 C to + 200°C at a heating rate of 10°C/min, after cooling with liquid nitrogen as a cryogenic. Tg was obtained from the temperature fluctuation point of the temperature.
