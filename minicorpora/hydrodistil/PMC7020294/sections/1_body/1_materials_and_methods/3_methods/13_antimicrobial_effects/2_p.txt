0: Antimicrobial activity of developed films was assessed using the agar diffusion method (Dashipour et al.,  2015; Sayanjali et al.,  2011).
1: The inhibition zone test on PDA was used to determine the antimicrobial activity of developed films containing CMC: G (4:1) with different concentrations of DbE (F6F9) (Table  1).
2: About 0.1 ml of each mold spore suspension of 10 4 spores/ml was cultured on PDA.
3: Disk form films of 10 mm diameter were placed in sterile conditions at the center of petri dishes containing a medium.
4: The petri dishes were incubated in the oven at 25C for 48 hr.
5: Then, the diameter of the inhibitory zone surrounding film disks was measured using a caliper with 0.01 mm precision.
6: Inhibitory zone diameter was considered as an index of antimicrobial activity of films (Sayanjali et al.,  2011).
