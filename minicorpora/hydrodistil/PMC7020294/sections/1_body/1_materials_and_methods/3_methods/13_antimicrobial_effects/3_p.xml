<p>In cases that inhibition zone was not formed means, there was no antimicrobial activity. So, instead of reporting 10 mm (primary diameter of the disk), its equivalent size was considered zero. While the antimicrobial activity was observed, the composed inhibition zone diameter always was more than 10 mm. To ensure the steady growth of mold on the surface of a petri dish, a cultured petri dish without film was used as control. Also, a petri dish lacking mold was used to ensure that no mold contamination there is.</p>
