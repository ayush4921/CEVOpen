<p>Antimicrobial activity of developed films was assessed using the agar diffusion method (Dashipour et al.,

 <xref rid="fsn31413-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). The inhibition zone test on PDA was used to determine the antimicrobial activity of developed films containing CMC: G (4:1) with different concentrations of DbE (F6–F9) (Table 
 <xref rid="fsn31413-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). About 0.1 ml of each mold spore suspension of 10
 <sup>4</sup> spores/ml was cultured on PDA. Disk form films of 10 mm diameter were placed in sterile conditions at the center of petri dishes containing a medium. The petri dishes were incubated in the oven at 25°C for 48 hr. Then, the diameter of the inhibitory zone surrounding film disks was measured using a caliper with 0.01 mm precision. Inhibitory zone diameter was considered as an index of antimicrobial activity of films (Sayanjali et al.,
