0: The color values of developed films in terms of L*, a*, and b* were measured using a colorimeter (Minolta, Tokyo, Japan).
1: Films were placed in desiccators at 25C and 53% RH prior to optical measurements (Sothornvit et al.,  2009).
2: A white reflector standard plate was used as background.
3: Triplicate measurements of color were conducted for each film.
4: Total color difference (E) was calculated by the following equations: (7)E=l2+a2+b2L = (L*  L 0*); a = (a*  a 0*); b = (b*  b 0*); a 0*, b 0*, L 0*: standard color parameter values; a*, b*, L*: film color parameter values; l*: brightness, which has a range of 0 (darkness) to 100 (brightness); a*: from  a*: greenness to + a*: redness; b*: from  b*: blueness to + b* yellowness.
