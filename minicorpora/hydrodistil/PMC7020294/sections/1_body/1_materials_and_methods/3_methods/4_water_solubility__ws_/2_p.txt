0: Solubility in water was determined based on the method of Dashipour et al.
1: ( 2015) with some modifications.
2: The films were cut into 2  2 cm; then, the pieces of films were heated in an oven at 100C for 24 hr to constant weight (Wo).
3: Then, the pieces of films were immersed in containers containing 50 ml of distilled water for 24 hr at room temperature (25C) on a magnetic stirrer.
4: The films were then filtered by filter paper to obtain undissolved films and dried at 100C to reach a constant weight to obtain the final dry weight of the film (Wf).
5: The WS was calculated according to the following equation: (2)Water solubility%=Wo-WfWo100
