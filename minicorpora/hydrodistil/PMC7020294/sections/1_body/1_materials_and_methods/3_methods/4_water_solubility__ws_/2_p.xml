<p>Solubility in water was determined based on the method of Dashipour et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31413-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>) with some modifications. The films were cut into 2 × 2 cm; then, the pieces of films were heated in an oven at 100°C for 24 hr to constant weight (Wo). Then, the pieces of films were immersed in containers containing 50 ml of distilled water for 24 hr at room temperature (25°C) on a magnetic stirrer. The films were then filtered by filter paper to obtain undissolved films and dried at 100°C to reach a constant weight to obtain the final dry weight of the film (Wf). The WS was calculated according to the following equation:
