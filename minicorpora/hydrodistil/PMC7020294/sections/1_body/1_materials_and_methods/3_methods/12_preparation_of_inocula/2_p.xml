 <xref rid="fsn31413-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>) with some adjustments. The fungal cultures were cultivated on PDA slants for 7 days at 20–25ºC. About 10 ml of this solution was vigorously stirred with crystal balls for several minutes. This allows spores were plucked from colony surface and enter into the solution; then, the solution was passed through No. 1 filter paper in sterile conditions and mold mycelium and plucked particles remained on filter paper. The spores were collected under the filter paper. At this stage, the collected solution was diluted with a solution of Tween 80 (0.1%) and its light absorption was measured using UV‐Vis Spectrophotometer (U‐2000, Hitachi, Japan) at the wavelength of 360 nm to obtain a suspension of 10
 <sup>4</sup> spores/ml (Fan &amp; Chen,
