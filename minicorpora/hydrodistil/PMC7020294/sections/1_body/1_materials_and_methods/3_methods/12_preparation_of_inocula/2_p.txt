0: Inocula were prepared as described by Sayanjali et al .
1: ( 2011) with some adjustments.
2: The fungal cultures were cultivated on PDA slants for 7 days at 2025oC.
3: About 10 ml of this solution was vigorously stirred with crystal balls for several minutes.
4: This allows spores were plucked from colony surface and enter into the solution; then, the solution was passed through No.
5: 1 filter paper in sterile conditions and mold mycelium and plucked particles remained on filter paper.
6: The spores were collected under the filter paper.
7: At this stage, the collected solution was diluted with a solution of Tween 80 (0.1%) and its light absorption was measured using UVVis Spectrophotometer (U2000, Hitachi, Japan) at the wavelength of 360 nm to obtain a suspension of 10 4 spores/ml (Fan & Chen,  1999).
