0: 5% suspension of CMC: G with ratios of 0:5, 1:4, 2.5:2.5, 4:1, and 5:0 were prepared, and after the addition of glycerol 40% (w/w of CMCG) as a plasticizer per each gram mixture of CMCG and 1% Tween 80 as emulsifier, the mixture was heated for 30 min at 8090C, on a hot plate that equipped with a magnetic stirrer with speed of 1,200 rpm, until a clear solution being achieved (F1F5) (Table  1).
