0: Film thickness was measured in mm with a digital micrometer (Mitutoyo 29334030, Tokyo, Japan) with a sensitivity of 0.001 mm to determine the water vapor permeability (WVP) and tensile strength (TS).
1: Results were reported as an average of at least five random locations for each film sheet (Coronado Jorge, Alexandre, Caicedo Flaker, & Bittante,  2015).
