0: The films were cut into 3  2 cm pieces, and then, the pieces of films were placed inside the UVVis Spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan).
1: The transparency was determined by measuring the percent light absorption (%T) at 600 nm (Sothornvit, Rhim, & Hong,  2009).
2: The following equation was used to calculate the transparency (T 600): (1)T600=Log%T100dwhere d is the film thickness (mm).
