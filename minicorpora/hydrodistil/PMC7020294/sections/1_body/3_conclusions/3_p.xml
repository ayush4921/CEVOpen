<p>The addition of 3 mentioned concentrations of DbE to the optimal film could show an antimicrobial effect against 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> (PTCC‐5004), 
 <italic>A. parasiticus</italic> (PTCC‐5286), and 
 <italic>A. parasiticus</italic> (PTCC‐5018) at the end of 6 months of storage. In terms of antioxidant and antimicrobial properties, the most appropriate and most affordable concentration that has the more inhibitor effect of DbE was 600 ppm. So, F9 was selected as the best formulae for pistachio protection against aflatoxin‐producing molds. Thus, F9 can be used as a biodegradable, low‐cost, and high‐performance packaging in the food industry to improve the quality, shelf life, safety, and reduce waste and loss of food.
