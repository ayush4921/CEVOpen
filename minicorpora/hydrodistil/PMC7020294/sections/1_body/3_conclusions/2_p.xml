<p>The results showed that changes in CMC‐G ratios in formulated edible films had a significant effect on its mechanical and physical–chemical properties. As a result of increasing the amount of CMC, the film's characteristics improved. Among the developed formulae, the optimal film was the film formulated with CMC and G in the ratio 4 to 1 (F4). In order to evaluate the mechanical, physicochemical, antioxidant, and antimicrobial properties of the optimal film, 300, 450, and 600 ppm of DbE was added.</p>
