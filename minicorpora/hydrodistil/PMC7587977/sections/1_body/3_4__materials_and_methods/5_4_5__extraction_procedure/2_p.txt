0: For each protocol, 20 g of milled plant material was mixed with 250 mL MiliQ water.
1: For HD-RE, this mixture was subjected to reflux extraction at 40 C for 1 h under stirring conditions.
2: For enzyme-assisted pretreatments, we have followed previously described protocols [ 2, 19] with slight modifications.
3: Namely, the plant material in MiliQ water was subjected to reflux extraction at 40 C for 1 h under stirring conditions in the presence of 10 mg pectinase, cellulase, or xylanase, that is, 0.5 mg of enzyme per g of dried plant material, or their combination (5 mg of each enzyme, i.e., 0.75 mg of total enzymes per g of dried plant material).
4: For HD-U, the plant material in MiliQ water was treated with a 14 mm diameter ultrasonic probe (ultrasonic device UP200Ht, Hielscher, Teltow, Germany), at 30% of the maximal ultrasonic power for 10 min.
5: Before the ultrasound extraction, optimal duration, and amplitude were determined ( Table 1).
