<p>In this study, we have obtained similar volatile profiles of sage, rosemary, and bay laurel essential oils as reported elsewhere [

 <xref rid="B39-molecules-25-04818" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Also, the essential oil composition obtained after different pretreatments was comparable to the essential oils obtained by direct hydrodistillation. Other studies had also shown that enzymatic and ultrasonic pretreatments did not affect the overall composition of the oil [

 <xref rid="B26-molecules-25-04818" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], although some authors reported that the quantities of individual major components varied significantly in relation to the extraction technique used [

 <xref rid="B19-molecules-25-04818" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] reported that enzyme pretreatment of bay laurel leaves resulted in increased concentration of oxygenated monoterpenes, and explained such effect by a possible increase in oxidation after cell wall disruption or the presence of oxidases in the enzyme preparation. Also, cellulase pretreatment reportedly increased the amount of cis-verbenol and camphor and decreased the amounts of 1,8-cineol, α-pinene, fenchene, and terpinen-4-ol in rosemary essential oil [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-25-04818" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. We have also observed that the ratios of some components varied among different pretreatments. For example, in sage essential oil, the amount of almost all monoterpene hydrocarbons increased after HD-REPCX. On the other hand, HD-US resulted in a higher amount of major oxygenated monoterpenes (1,8–cineole, α-thujone, camphor). In bay laurel essential oil, all pretreatments, except HD-REX, resulted in an increase of 1,8-cineole, which is in line with the findings of Boulila et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-25-04818" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In rosemary essential oil, an increase of monoterpene hydrocarbons was noticeable after HD-US, while HD-RE resulted in an increase of 1,8-cineole and linalool, as well as phenylpropane derivatives eugenol and methyleugenol. However, such slight changes in the quantity of individual components observed after different pretreatments were not significant and did not change the overall oil quality, as confirmed by the statistical analysis of GC-MS results.
