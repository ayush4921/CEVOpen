<p>Seventy-one components were identified in the sage essential oils by GC-MS, representing up to 97% of total GC peak areas (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-04818">Table S1</xref>). Sage essential oils were richest in oxygenated monoterpenes, such as α- and β–thujone (up to 23% and 10%, respectively), camphor (up to 17%), borneol (up to 8%), and 1,8-cineole (up to 8%). Additionally, some sesquiterpenes were present in significant quantities, such as manool and veridiflorol (up to 14% each). Among other compounds, phenylpropane derivates, eugenol (up to 3%), and methyleugenol (up to 2%) were detected with significant percentages, although much lower than monoterpene and sesquiterpene major compounds.
