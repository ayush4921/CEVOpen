0: Further, enzyme-assisted extraction has been intensively studied in the last decade, since the plant cell wall, as a structure composed mainly of resistant polymers like cellulose, xylan, lignin, and pectin, can reduce the extraction efficiency.
1: Enzymes, like cellulase, xylanase, and pectinase, can degrade or disrupt cell wall components, thus enabling better release and more efficient extraction of bioactive compounds from plants and improving the bioactive content of essential oils and extracts [ 2, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22].
2: However, while some authors reported that enzyme-assisted extraction enhanced essential oil yield and improved their chemical composition [ 2, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26], others did not demonstrate such effect [ 1], indicating that further research of enzyme application in plant extractions is necessary.
