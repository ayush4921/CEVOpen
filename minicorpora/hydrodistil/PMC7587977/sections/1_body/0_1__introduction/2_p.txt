0: Essential oils are usually isolated by steam- or hydrodistillation.
1: Although these methods have been successfully used for years, novel extraction procedures are being developed in recent decades, with the aim to increase the yield of essential oils and/or improve their chemical composition, while shortening the extraction time [ 9].
2: To get closer to that ideal goal, novel production procedures, like ultrasound or enzymatic degradation of the cell wall, are being applied as pretreatments to distillation.
3: Benefits of ultrasound application in solidliquid extraction are the intensification of mass transfer, improved solvent penetration into the plant tissue, and capillary effects.
4: The collapse of cavitation bubbles near the cell walls is assumed to cause the cell disruption and at the same time a good penetration of the solvent into the cells through the ultrasonic jet [ 10].
5: Several studies have reported that the addition of ultrasonic pretreatment before hydrodistillation leads to a shortening of the extraction time [ 11, 12, 13, 14], sometimes also accompanied by yield increase [ 12, 13, 15, 16, 17] and improvement in oil chemical composition [ 9, 12, 13, 14].
