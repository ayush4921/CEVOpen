 <caption> Overview of the chemical composition of sage ( A), bay laurel ( B), and rosemary ( C) essential oils after different hydrodistillation pretreatments, as determined by GC-MS. Hydrodistillation without pretreatment (negative control)—HD; hydrodistillation with reflux extraction pretreatment—HD-RE; hydrodistillation with reflux extraction pretreatment assisted with enzymes: xylanase—HD-REX; cellulase—HD-REC; pectinase—HD-REP; pectinase + cellulase + xylanase—HD-REPCX; hydrodistillation with ultrasonic pretreatment—HD-US. </caption>
