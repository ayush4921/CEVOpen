0: The determination of the ferric reducing antioxidant power or the ferric reducing capacity (FRAP test) was carried out as described by Parra et al.
1: [ 47], with some modifications.
2: The FRAP reagent was prepared by mixing 25 mL of acetate buffer (300 mmol/L, pH 3.6), 2.5 mL of TPTZ solution (10 mmol/L) in hydrochloric acid (40 mmol/L), and 2.5 mL of FeCl 36H 2O (20 mmol/L).
3: For measurement, 25 L of diluted extract (0.5 g/L) was mixed with 175 L of FRAP reagent in a 96-well microplate.
4: The mixture was incubated for 40 min at 25 C, and then absorption was recorded at 593 nm in a Synergy TM HTX multimodal microplate reader (BioTek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT, USA).
5: To quantify each solutions antioxidant capacity, Trolox was used as standard and ethanol 80%  v/v as blank.
