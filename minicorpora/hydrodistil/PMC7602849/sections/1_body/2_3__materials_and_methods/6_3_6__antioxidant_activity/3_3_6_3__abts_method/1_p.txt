0: The ABTS assay was performed by bleaching the cationic radical ABTS + as described by Soto et al.
1: [ 48].
2: For the preparation of the radical ABTS +, 2.5 mL of the 7 mM ABTS solution was mixed with 2.5 mL of 2.45 M sodium persulfate for 12 h in the dark at 4 C. Then, the resulting solution was diluted with absolute ethanol until an initial absorbance of approximately 0.70  0.03 was obtained at 734 nm.
3: The radical discoloration was initiated by adding 50 L of the extract to 150 L of the ABTS + solution.
4: After 15 min of incubation at 25 C, the absorbance was measured at 734 nm and compared with a calibration curve using Trolox as standard and ethanol as blank.
5: Results were expressed as millimoles of Trolox equivalents per gram of dry sample (mmol TE/g).
