0: The radical DPPH methodology was used with some modifications [ 38].
1: In an analytical balance, 0.0197 g of material was ground and brought to a final volume of 50 mL in 80% ethanol.
2: A 100 L aliquot of 1 mM DPPH was then mixed with 100 L of gallic acid standard (15120 ppm) and solution of essential oil from 2 g/L to 50 g/L.
3: The absorbance was fixed at 517 nm, with shaking for 5 min and incubation for 30 min at 36 C. The percentage of radical inhibition DPPH was calculated according to the following formula: (2)% = (Abscontrol  Abssample)Abscontrol  100
