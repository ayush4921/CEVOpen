0: The antibacterial activity of oregano oil was determined by the method described by Klancnik et al., with modifications [ 49].
1: A stock solution of 10% ( v/v) oregano oil in ethanol was prepared.
2: An aliquot of 15 L of the stock solution was impregnated on 5 mm sterile cellulose filter paper disks.
3: The same procedure was repeated with disks impregnated only with ethanol, which were used as a negative control.
4: The impregnated disks were dried under the biosafety chamber flow to evaporate ethanol and avoid its antimicrobial effect.
5: Disks containing 50 g kanamycin were used as a positive control of bacterial inhibition.
6: Fresh inocula of each bacterial species were prepared as previously described, diluted to 0.5 of McFarland standard, and inoculated uniformly on plates containing nutrient broth supplemented with 12 g/L of agar.
7: The dried and impregnated disks were arranged equidistant from each other.
8: The plates were incubated for 24 h at 25 C or 35 C, as appropriate.
9: Bacterial growth inhibition diameter was recorded after the incubation step, which is observed as a transparent halo without growth around each disk.
10: The tests were carried out in triplicate.
