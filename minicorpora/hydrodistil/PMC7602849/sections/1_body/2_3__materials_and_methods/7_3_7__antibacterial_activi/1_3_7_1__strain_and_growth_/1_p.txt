0: Oregano oil was used to determine antibacterial activity against the human pathogenic bacteria  Escherichia coli (ATCC 23716),  Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 19429),  Salmonella enterica (ATCC 13311),  Bacillus subtilis (ATCC 6051), and  Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29737); and the phytopathogenic bacteria  Erwinia rhapontici (MK883065),  Pseudomonas syringae (MF547632),  Pantoea agglomerans (MK883087),  Agrobacterium tumefaciens (ATCC 19358), and  Xanthomonas campestris (MH885473).
1: Bacteria were inoculated into nutrient broth containing 5.0 g/L peptone and 3.0 g/L meat extract and incubated at 25 C (plant pathogens) or 35 C (human pathogens) for 18 h at 150 rpm using an incubator with orbital shaking LOM-80 (MRC Lab, London, UK).
