0: The bactericidal capacity of oregano oil was determined from the last three wells that showed no bacterial growth in the MIC assay, as described by Taylor et al.
1: [ 51].
2: For this, 100 L of these cultures were taken and plated in nutrient broth plates supplemented with agar.
3: As a growth control, a culture that did show microbial growth in the MIC test was used.
4: The plates were incubated for 24 h at the corresponding temperature, after which the concentration of oregano oil where no growth was observed (MBC) was determined for each microorganism.
