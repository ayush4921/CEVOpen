0: The minimum concentration of oregano oil necessary to inhibit bacterial growth was carried out using the method described by Andrews [ 50].
1: The final oregano oil concentrations used were 0 to 10% ( v/v).
2: The final working volume for each concentration was 200 L. Each dilution was inoculated with the different bacteria to be tested in 96-well plates at 25 C or 35 C, as appropriate.
3: As controls, nutrient broth without compound inoculated with each bacterium (growth control), and nutrient broth with 010% ( v/v) of oregano oil without bacterial inoculation (negative control of growth and sterility of the compound) were used.
4: An assay using 090% ethanol was performed to estimate the ethanol MIC of each bacterium.
5: Concentrations higher than 20% ethanol were shown to be inhibitory for all bacteria.
6: For this reason, a 40% ( v/v) oregano oil was prepared as a stock solution to avoid the inhibitory effect of ethanol during MIC assays.
7: After 24 h of incubation, we determined the lowest concentration of compound at which no bacterial growth was observed.
