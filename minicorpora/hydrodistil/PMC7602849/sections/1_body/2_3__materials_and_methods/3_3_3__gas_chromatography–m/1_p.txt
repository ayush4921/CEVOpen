0: GC-MS analysis was carried out as described by Teixeira et al., with some modifications [ 24].
1: The essential oil was analyzed using an Agilent 5975 gas chromatograph coupled to an Agilent 5973N mass-selective detector (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA., USA).
2: It was fitted with an HP-5MS capillary column (30 m length  0.32 mm internal diameter  0.25 m film thickness).
3: The oven temperature was programmed at 45 C for 1 min, raised to 250 C at 5 C min 1, and maintained at 250 C for 5 min.
4: Helium was used as carrier gas at 30 cm s 1, and the injection volume was 1 L. The identity of each compound was assigned by comparing their retention index relative to a standard mixture of  n-alkanes, as well as by comparison with the mass spectra characteristic features obtained from the Wiley data bank (Wiley 7N Edition [Agilent Part No.
5: G1035B]: Wiley Registry of Mass Spectral Data, 7th Edition), whenever possible, co-injections with authentic samples.
