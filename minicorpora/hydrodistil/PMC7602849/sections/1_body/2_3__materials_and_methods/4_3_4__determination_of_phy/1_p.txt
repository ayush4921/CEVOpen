0: Physicochemical characteristics were evaluated as described by Tellez-Monzon et al.
1: [ 21], with some modifications.
2: The fresh essential oils specific density was measured using a 10 mL pycnometer at 20 C. The weight of the empty pycnometer was recorded.
3: The pycnometer was filled with the essential oil and weighed again.
4: The experiment was carried out in triplicate.
5: The density of the essential oils at room temperature was calculated using the formula: (1)Density = massvolume
