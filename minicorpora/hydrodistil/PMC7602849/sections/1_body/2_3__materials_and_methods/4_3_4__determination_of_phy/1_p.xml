<p>Physicochemical characteristics were evaluated as described by Tellez-Monzón et al. [
 <xref rid="B21-metabolites-10-00414" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], with some modifications. The fresh essential oil’s specific density was measured using a 10 mL pycnometer at 20 °C. The weight of the empty pycnometer was recorded. The pycnometer was filled with the essential oil and weighed again. The experiment was carried out in triplicate. The density of the essential oils at room temperature was calculated using the formula:
