0: Total polyphenol content was determined using the Folin-Ciocalteu method, with some modifications [ 38].
1: From the 50 g/L solution, one was prepared at 0.5 g/L, where an aliquot of the solution (1000 L) was mixed with 500 L of Folin-Ciocalteu reagent (50%  v/v) and 5000 L of ethanol at 80%  v/v.
2: After 5 min of reaction, 250 L of 5%  w/v Na 2CO 3 was added and brought to a final volume of 8000 L with 80%  v/v ethanol.
3: This was then allowed to incubate for 30 min at room temperature.
4: Each sample was measured at 760 nm and compared to a calibration curve using gallic acid as the standard.
