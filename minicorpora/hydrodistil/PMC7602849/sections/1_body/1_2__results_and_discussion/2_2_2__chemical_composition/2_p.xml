<p>In most cases, carvacrol constituted the major component (12.6–88.7%) of the oil, while the sum of the two phenolic monoterpenes (carvacrol and thymol) and their biosynthetic precursors

One of the arid Andean region’s main environmental characteristics is its high radiation levels, which would favor the concentration of some phenolic monoterpenes in the essential oil, as reported by Naghdi Badi [
