<p>The 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> essential oil composition was analyzed by GC-MS. The compound identification was carried out by comparing the relative retention times and the mass spectra of oil components with authentic samples and mass spectra from the data library. In total, fifty compounds were identified in 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> essential oil, accounting for 99.2% of the whole composition, and they are mostly monoterpene hydrocarbons (38.7%), oxygenated monoterpenes (38.0%), and phenolic monoterpenes (19.0%). Within the monoterpene hydrocarbons, Î´-terpinene (10.6%), 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (8.6%), and sabinene (6.5%) were the major compounds detected, while 
 <italic>Z</italic>-sabinene hydrate (13.4%), linalyl acetate (7.2%), and carvacrol methyl ether (5.6%) were the most abundant oxygenated monoterpenes detected (

 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> essential oil. Carvacrol was also identified, but in a lower concentration (3.1%). The phytochemical contents of oregano oil from the arid region, especially the phenolic monoterpenes, curiously exhibited a great difference compared to what was reported by other authors [
