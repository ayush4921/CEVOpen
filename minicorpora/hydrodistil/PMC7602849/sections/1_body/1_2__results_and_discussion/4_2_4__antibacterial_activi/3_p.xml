<p>The high sensitivity of all of the tested strains to the essential oil of 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> is of particular interest. This antimicrobial effect could be attributed to an alteration in the lipidic components of the bacterial plasma membrane, resulting in the leakage of intracellular contents [
 <xref rid="B44-metabolites-10-00414" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Furthermore, 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> essential oil’s higher antimicrobial activity could be explained by the amount of phenolic oxygenated monoterpenes—especially thymol, 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene, and carvacrol, which were found in the ratio of 27.6% and they could show a synergistic effect causing membrane destabilization. Some studies ensure that the combination of carvacrol and thymol at low concentrations could be used as a reference to apply this combination in foods to control 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, to maintain the organoleptic properties, and to extend the shelf-life of them [

 <xref rid="B18-metabolites-10-00414" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], beef meatballs [
 <xref rid="B46-metabolites-10-00414" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], fish and meat products [
 <xref rid="B19-metabolites-10-00414" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In this context, the activity found in essential oil from the arid Andean region revealed its potential as a food additive to combat common foodborne pathogens.
