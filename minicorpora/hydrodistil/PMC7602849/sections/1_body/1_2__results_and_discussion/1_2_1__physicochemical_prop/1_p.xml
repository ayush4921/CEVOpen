 <xref rid="metabolites-10-00414-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the conditions, yields, and physical properties of the essential oil of oregano obtained by hydro-distillation. The density was 0.913 g/mL, and the refractive index was 1.4775; these values are similar to those reported previously for the same spice [

 <xref rid="B22-metabolites-10-00414" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. According to some research, the refractive index and density are proportionally related to the amount of phenols present [
 <xref rid="B23-metabolites-10-00414" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The acidity index was 0.8345 mg of KOH/g of sample, equivalent to 0.419 g of oleic acid/100 g of oil.
