<p>The NMR spectra were obtained on a Bruker Avance III at an operating frequency of 400.0 MHz for 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR and 100.6 MHz for 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR, using the solvent peak as internal reference at 25 °C. All chemical shifts are given in ppm using 
 <italic>δ</italic> Me
 <sub>4</sub>Si = 0 ppm as reference, and 
 <italic>J</italic> values are given in hertz. Assignments were made by a comparison of chemical shifts, peak multiplicities, and 
 <italic>J</italic> values, and were supported by spin decoupling–double resonance and bidimensional heteronuclear correlation techniques. High-resolution mass spectrometry analyses were performed at the CACTUS, Unidade de Masas e Proteómica, at the University of Santiago de Compostela, Spain.
