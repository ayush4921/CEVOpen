0: The NMR spectra were obtained on a Bruker Avance III at an operating frequency of 400.0 MHz for  1H NMR and 100.6 MHz for  13C NMR, using the solvent peak as internal reference at 25 C. All chemical shifts are given in ppm using   Me 4Si = 0 ppm as reference, and  J values are given in hertz.
1: Assignments were made by a comparison of chemical shifts, peak multiplicities, and  J values, and were supported by spin decouplingdouble resonance and bidimensional heteronuclear correlation techniques.
2: High-resolution mass spectrometry analyses were performed at the CACTUS, Unidade de Masas e Proteomica, at the University of Santiago de Compostela, Spain.
