<p>For the assessment of viability, a resazurin-based method was used. 
 <italic>Sf9</italic> and HaCaT cells were plated at a density of 3.0 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> and 1.5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well, respectively, incubated for 24 h, and then exposed to the molecules under study for 24 h. After this period, a commercial solution of resazurin was added (1:10), and the kinetic reaction of fluorescence increase monitored at 560/590 nm. For HaCaT and 
 <italic>Sf9</italic> cells, 30 and 60 min of incubation were used, respectively.
