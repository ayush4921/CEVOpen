0: For the assessment of viability, a resazurin-based method was used.
1: Sf9 and HaCaT cells were plated at a density of 3.0  10 4 and 1.5  10 4 cells/well, respectively, incubated for 24 h, and then exposed to the molecules under study for 24 h. After this period, a commercial solution of resazurin was added (1:10), and the kinetic reaction of fluorescence increase monitored at 560/590 nm.
2: For HaCaT and  Sf9 cells, 30 and 60 min of incubation were used, respectively.
