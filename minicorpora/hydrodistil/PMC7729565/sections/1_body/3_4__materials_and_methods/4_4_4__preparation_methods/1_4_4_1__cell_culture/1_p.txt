0: Sf9 ( Spodoptera frugiperda) cells were maintained as a suspension culture and cultivated in Graces medium with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin, at 28 C. Cells were used in experiments while in the exponential phase of growth.
1: On the other hand, HaCaT (human keratinocyte) cells were cultured in Dulbeccos modified eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 C, in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2.
