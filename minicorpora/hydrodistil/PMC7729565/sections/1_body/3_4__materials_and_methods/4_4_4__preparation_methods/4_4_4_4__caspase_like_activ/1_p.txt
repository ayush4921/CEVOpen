0: Sf9 cells were plated at the same density described for viability studies and exposed to the molecules under study for the designated time.
1: Generally, the same method described by the authors previously for mammalian cells [ 39] was used; however, it was adapted for insect cells.
2: After the incubation period, caspase-3/7 substrate was added to wells and cells incubated for 20 min at 22 C. The luminescent signal was measured in a microplate reader (Cytation 3, BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA), and was performed in duplicate in three independent experiments.
