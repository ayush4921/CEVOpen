 <italic>Sf9</italic> cells were plated at the same density described for viability studies and exposed to the molecules under study for the designated time. Generally, the same method described by the authors previously for mammalian cells [
 <xref rid="B39-ijms-21-09257" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] was used; however, it was adapted for insect cells. After the incubation period, caspase-3/7 substrate was added to wells and cells incubated for 20 min at 22 Â°C. The luminescent signal was measured in a microplate reader (Cytation 3, BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA), and was performed in duplicate in three independent experiments.
