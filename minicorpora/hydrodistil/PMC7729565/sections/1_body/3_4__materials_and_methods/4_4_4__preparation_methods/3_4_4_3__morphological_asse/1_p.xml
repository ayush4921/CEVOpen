<p>For morphological studies, 
 <italic>Sf9</italic> cells were cultured in 96-well plates at the same density used for viability experiments, in the presence of the molecules under study. After incubation, cells were washed with Hanks’ balanced salt solution (HBSS) and fixed in 10% formalin solution for 30 min, at room temperature. CF543 (5 U/mL) and DAPI (0.25 µg/mL) were added, and cells were stained for 25 min at room temperature and washed with HBSS.
