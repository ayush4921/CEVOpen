<p>To a solution of 4-allyl-2-methoxyphenol 
 <bold>1</bold> (1 equiv) in acetonitrile (5 mL), the corresponding alkyl halide (1.1 equiv) and cesium carbonate (5 equiv) were added, and the resulting mixture was heated at 60 Â°C for 2 h 30 min. The progress of the reaction was monitored by TLC (ethyl acetate/light petroleum = 1:10). The excess of base was filtered, the solvent was evaporated, and the crude mixture was purified by column chromatography on silica gel using ethyl acetate/light petroleum (1:10) as the eluent.
