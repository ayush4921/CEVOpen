<p>The extraction of 4-allyl-2-methoxyphenol, eugenol 
 <bold>1</bold>, was made from 
 <italic>Syzygium aromaticum</italic> (cloves) in a round-bottom flask containing distilled water (200 mL) and the cloves (21.415 g). Hydrodistillation assembly was performed, and the mixture was refluxed during 2 h. The distillate was extracted with dichloromethane (3 Ã— 150 mL), the organic phase was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulphate, and solvent evaporation under vacuum yielded 4-allyl-2-methoxyphenol, eugenol (
