0: The respective precursor (1 equiv)  2ae (4 mL) dissolved in dichloromethane was added dropwise to a solution of  m-chloroperbenzoic acid (1 equiv) in dichloromethane (6 mL) at 0 C. After stirring for 1 h,  m-chloroperbenzoic acid was again added (1 equiv), and the reaction mixture was stirred for more 12 h. A 10% aqueous solution of sodium sulfate (10 mL) was added, and the resulting solution was washed with 5% aqueous solution of sodium hydrogen carbonate (2  10 mL).
1: The organic phase was dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and the solvent was evaporated.
