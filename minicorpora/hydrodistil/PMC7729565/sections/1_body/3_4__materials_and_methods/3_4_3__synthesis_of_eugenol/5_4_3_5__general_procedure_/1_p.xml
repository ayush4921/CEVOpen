<p>The respective precursor (1 equiv) 
 <bold>2a–e</bold> (4 mL) dissolved in dichloromethane was added dropwise to a solution of 
 <italic>m-</italic>chloroperbenzoic acid (1 equiv) in dichloromethane (6 mL) at 0 °C. After stirring for 1 h, 
 <italic>m</italic>-chloroperbenzoic acid was again added (1 equiv), and the reaction mixture was stirred for more 12 h. A 10% aqueous solution of sodium sulfate (10 mL) was added, and the resulting solution was washed with 5% aqueous solution of sodium hydrogen carbonate (2 × 10 mL). The organic phase was dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and the solvent was evaporated.
