<p>Eugenol 
 <bold>1</bold> is easily obtained by hydrodistillation from clove, and is known for its various biological activities, as mentioned above, namely insecticidal. As an attempt to find semisynthetic alternatives with improved insecticidal activity, eugenol derivatives 
 <bold>2a–f</bold> and 
 <bold>3a–e</bold> were prepared; two of these have been shown to be highly and selectively toxic to insects, but not to human cells.
