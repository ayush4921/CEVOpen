<p>Bearing in mind the importance of developing new and more potent insecticides that have a safe toxicological profile towards mammalian organisms, the impact of 
 <bold>3b</bold> and 
 <bold>3e</bold> in human cells has been evaluated. Considering the usual routes of poisoning, specifically skin, human keratinocytes, were chosen. As it can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-09257-f003">Figure 3</xref>B, 
 <bold>3b</bold> caused around 40% loss of cell viability (equivalent to the commercial insecticide chlorpyrifos), which is still less pronounced than the effect elicited in insect cells. In the case of 
 <bold>3e</bold>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-09257-f003">Figure 3</xref>B shows that it had no effect in human cells at the same concentration in which it caused around 50% of cell viability loss in insect cells, thus displaying a selective effect towards the latter.
