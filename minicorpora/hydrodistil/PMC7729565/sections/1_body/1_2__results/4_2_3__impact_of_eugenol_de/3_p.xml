<p>When examining the 4’, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) channel (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-09257-f002">Figure 2</xref>), it was clear that the 
 <bold>3b</bold>- and 
 <bold>3e</bold>-treated cells exhibited chromatin changes, karyorrhexis (nuclear fragmentation; yellow arrows), and pyknosis (chromatin condensation; green arrows). We have quantified this effect (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-09257">Supplementary Table S1</xref>), results, showing that incubation with 
 <bold>3b</bold> resulted in an increase of fragmented and condensed chromatin to 34.8 ± 0.3% and 12.6 ± 4.2%, respectively, while 
 <bold>3e</bold> elicited 21.2 ± 0.8% and 5.8 ± 0.5%, respectively.
