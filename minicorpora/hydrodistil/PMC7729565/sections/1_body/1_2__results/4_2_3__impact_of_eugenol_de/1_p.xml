<p>We were interested in assessing the impact that 
 <bold>3b</bold> and 
 <bold>3e</bold> had in the morphology of the insect cells under study. For this reason, treated cells were imaged to evaluate chromatin status and overall cell morphology. We used both molecules at the same concentration that had been assessed for viability studies (100 µg/mL); however, the effect of 
 <bold>3e</bold> was so pronounced that no cells remained. For this reason, in the specific case of this molecule, the concentration of 50 µg/mL was used.
