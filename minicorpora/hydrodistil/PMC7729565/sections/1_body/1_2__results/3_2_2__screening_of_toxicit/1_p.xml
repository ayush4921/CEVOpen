<p>As a model for insecticide activity, two-dimensional (2D) cultures of 
 <italic>Sf9</italic> cells, which derive from the ovary cells of 
 <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic> (a common pest) were used. All molecules were assayed at the same concentration (100 µg/mL) in order to allow direct comparison of their potency. The starting material, eugenol 
 <bold>1</bold>, was nearly devoid of any toxicity, causing a marginal decrease of viability (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-09257-f001">Figure 1</xref>). All eugenol derivatives arising from alkylation reactions of the hydroxyl group, and possessing a propyl chain with hydrogen, hydroxyl, ester, chlorine, and carboxylic acid as terminals (
 <bold>2a–f</bold>) displayed higher toxicity than the starting eugenol 
 <bold>1</bold>, with cells showing around 55–65% of viability (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-09257-f001">Figure 1</xref>). When analyzing the results of the oxiranes 
 <bold>3a–e</bold> series, which results from the epoxidation of the compound 
 <bold>2</bold> series, a distinct trend was found. In a general way, all members of the 3 series displayed enhanced toxicity when compared to 1. Among all derivatives, 
 <bold>3b</bold> and 
 <bold>3e</bold> were clearly the most potent, with the latter eliciting ca. 50% viability loss, while the former reached nearly 60% viability loss, nearly double the effect of the commercial insecticide chlorpyrifos (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-09257-f001">Figure 1</xref>). For this reason, these two molecules were further characterized for their effect.
