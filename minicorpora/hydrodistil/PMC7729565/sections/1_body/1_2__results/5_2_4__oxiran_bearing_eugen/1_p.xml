<p>Considering the lack of commercial options for the assessment of insect counterparts of mammalian caspases, it was hypothesized that the degree of homology described between insect and mammalian caspases [
 <xref rid="B36-ijms-21-09257" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] should be high enough for substrate cross-reactivity. For this reason, a substrate for mammalian executor caspase isoforms 3/7 has been used. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-09257-f003">Figure 3</xref>A, incubation of cells with 
 <bold>3b</bold> resulted in an about three-fold increase in caspase-like activity, reaching over six-fold in the case of 
 <bold>3e</bold>. For benchmarking purposes, the commercial insecticide chlorpyrifos was also evaluated, and its effect was not statistically different from control cells.
