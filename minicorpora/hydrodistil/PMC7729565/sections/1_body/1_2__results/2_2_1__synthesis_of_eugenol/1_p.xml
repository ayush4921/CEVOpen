<p>4-Allyl-2-methoxyphenol, eugenol 
 <bold>1</bold> was obtained by hydrodistillation from clove to a high degree of purity (≥95%), as confirmed by its 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum, and used in the synthesis of six 
 <italic>O</italic>-alkylated derivatives (
 <bold>2a–f</bold>) and five oxiranes (
 <bold>3a–e</bold>), as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="ijms-21-09257-sch001">Scheme 1</xref>. The structures of all the compounds were confirmed by 
 <sup>1</sup>H and 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectroscopy and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), and the corresponding analytical data are shown below.
