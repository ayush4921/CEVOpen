0: The intensive use of synthetic pesticides has resulted in damage to the environment, health hazards, and loss of biodiversity [ 4, 5], so it is necessary to adopt less harmful strategies that can include the use of natural-based pesticides, which will result in a healthy environment and sustainable agriculture [ 6, 7].
1: The concomitant use of natural pesticides/semisynthetic pesticides and synthetic pesticides could also take place as a changeover alternative to circumvent several negative effects of the exclusive use of synthetic compounds [ 8, 9, 10].
2: Owing to the structural diversity and biological activities of natural products, they could be rich sources of inspiration for the design optimization of active principles in formulation development [ 11, 12].
