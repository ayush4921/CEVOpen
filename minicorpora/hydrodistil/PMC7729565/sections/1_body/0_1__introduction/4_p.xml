<p>In fact, EOs extracted by steam distillation of many aromatic plants have recently received a lot of attention due to their broad spectrum of action. These natural ingredients, composed of complex mixtures of monoterpenes, biogenetically related phenols, and sesquiterpenes [

EOs are typically characterized by a low melting point; most of them are liquid at room temperature, and their application in plant protection has some limitations, due to their poor solubility in water and high volatility. However, they display efficacy, biodegradability, various modes of action, and low toxicity, as well as an availability of source materials [
