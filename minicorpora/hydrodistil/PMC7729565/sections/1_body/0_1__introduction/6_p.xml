<p>Considering all the above facts, in the present work semisynthetic eugenol derivatives—namely, 
 <italic>O</italic>-alkylated bearing the propyl chain with hydrogen, hydroxyl, ester, chlorine and carboxylic acid as terminals, as well as the corresponding 
 <italic>O</italic>-alkylated oxiranes—were synthesized. The main objective behind obtaining these eugenol derivatives was their evaluation as possible semisynthetic insecticides. Therefore, the biological activity of all compounds compared to a commercial synthetic insecticide was tested against 
 <italic>Sf9</italic> (
 <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic>) insect cell line. The results turned out to be very promising for future applications as active ingredients in formulations, with structural changes eliciting marked effects in terms of potency and, equally important, low toxicity towards human cells.
