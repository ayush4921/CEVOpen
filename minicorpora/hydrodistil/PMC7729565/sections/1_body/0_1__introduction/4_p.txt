0: In fact, EOs extracted by steam distillation of many aromatic plants have recently received a lot of attention due to their broad spectrum of action.
1: These natural ingredients, composed of complex mixtures of monoterpenes, biogenetically related phenols, and sesquiterpenes [ 17, 18, 19], display antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal activities, in addition to insecticide properties, as already mentioned [ 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24].
2: Owing to their wide spectrum of activity, these compounds are nowadays considered as an alternative to chemicals in many applications, such as food preservation, pharmaceuticals, alternative medicine, and natural therapies [ 25, 26, 27].
3: EOs are typically characterized by a low melting point; most of them are liquid at room temperature, and their application in plant protection has some limitations, due to their poor solubility in water and high volatility.
4: However, they display efficacy, biodegradability, various modes of action, and low toxicity, as well as an availability of source materials [ 6].
