<p>Structural modifications in the hydroxyl group and double bond of 4-allyl-2-methoxyphenol, eugenol 
 <bold>1</bold>, obtained by hydrodistillation of clove, were carried out. Alkylation of the hydroxyl group of 4-allyl-2-methoxyphenol 
 <bold>1</bold> with 1-bromopropane,1-bromo-3-chloropropane, 3-bromopropan-1-ol, and ethyl 4-bromobutanoate, using cesium carbonate as a base and by heating at 65 Â°C in acetonitrile, gave 4-allyl-2-methoxy-1-propoxybenzene 
 <bold>2a</bold>, 4-allyl-1-(3-chloropropoxy)-2-methoxybenzene 
 <bold>2b</bold>, 3-(4-allyl-2-methoxyphenoxy)propan-1-ol 
 <bold>2c</bold>, and ethyl 4-(4-allyl-2-methoxyphenoxy)butanoate 
 <bold>2e</bold>, respectively.
