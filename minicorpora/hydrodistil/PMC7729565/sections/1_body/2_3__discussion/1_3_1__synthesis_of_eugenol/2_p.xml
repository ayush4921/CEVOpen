<p>Compound 
 <bold>2c</bold> was further reacted with acetic anhydride by heating at 65 °C to obtain 3-(4-allyl-2-methoxyphenoxy)propyl acetate 
 <bold>2d</bold>. In addition, compound 
 <bold>2e</bold> was subjected to hydrolysis with aqueous 1M NaOH in 1,4-dioxane at room temperature to give 4-(4-allyl-2-methoxyphenoxy)butanoic acid 
 <bold>2f</bold>. Compounds 
 <bold>2a</bold>–
 <bold>e</bold> were obtained as oils or a solid material (
 <bold>2f</bold>) in 53% to 88% yields, and were fully characterized by 
 <sup>1</sup>H and 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectroscopy, as well as HRMS. The 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra of compounds 
 <bold>2a</bold>–
 <bold>f</bold> showed the different characteristic signals for the aliphatic protons of methylene and methyl groups (
 <italic>δ =</italic> 1.03–4.30 ppm), as well as the expected protons for the eugenol’s double bond as multiplets, CH
 <sub>2</sub> (
 <italic>δ</italic> = 5.01–5.14 ppm) and CH (
 <italic>δ</italic> = 5.90–6.04 ppm). 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra of all compounds showed signals of the aliphatic carbons from the methylene and methyl groups (
 <italic>δ</italic> = 10.23–70.44 ppm), and for compounds 
 <bold>2d</bold>, 
 <bold>2e</bold>, and 
 <bold>2f</bold> was visible the presence of signals for the carbonyl groups (
 <italic>δ</italic> = 170.76–179.15 ppm).
