<p>To perform epoxidation of the double bond of eugenol derivatives, compounds 
 <bold>2a</bold>–
 <bold>e</bold> reacted with 
 <italic>m</italic>-chloroperbenzoic acid in dichloromethane at room temperature, and the respective derivatives, namely 2-(3-methoxy-4-propoxybenzyl)oxirane 
 <bold>3a</bold>, 2-(4-(3-chloropropoxy)-3-methoxybenzyl)oxirane 
 <bold>3b</bold>, 3-(2-methoxy-4-(oxiran-2-ylmethyl)phenoxy)propan-1-ol 
 <bold>3c</bold>, 3-(2-methoxy-4-(oxiran-2-ylmethyl)phenoxy)propyl acetate 
 <bold>3d</bold>, and ethyl 4-(2-methoxy-4-(oxiran-2-ylmethyl)phenoxy)butanoate 
 <bold>3e</bold> were obtained. These compounds 
 <bold>3a</bold>–
 <bold>e</bold> were isolated as yellow oils in yields up to 67%, and were fully characterized by the usual analytical techniques. It stands out that epoxidation of compounds 
 <bold>2a</bold>–
 <bold>e</bold> was verified by the presence of the protons signals related the oxirane ring (
 <italic>δ</italic> = 2.52–3.17 ppm) and the absence of the signals of protons for the double bond of eugenol skeleton. The presence of carbon signals relative to oxirane ring, CH
 <sub>2</sub> (
 <italic>δ</italic> = 46.76–46.78 ppm, and CH = (
 <italic>δ</italic> 52.53–52.57 ppm) also confirmed the structure of expected eugenol derivatives 
 <bold>3a–e</bold>.
