<p>When evaluating the impact of all molecules obtained, a clear trend could be established. All derivatives arising from alkylation reactions of the hydroxyl group and possessing a propyl chain with hydrogen, hydroxyl, ester, chlorine, and carboxylic acid as terminals (
 <bold>2aâ€“f</bold>) displayed higher toxicity than the starting molecule 
 <bold>1</bold> (

 <bold>3b</bold> and 
 <bold>3e</bold> were clearly the most potent, eliciting a degree of viability loss higher than the commercial insecticide chlorpyrifos (
