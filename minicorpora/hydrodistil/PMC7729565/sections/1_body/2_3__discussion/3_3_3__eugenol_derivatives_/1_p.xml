<p>The results from morphological assessment showed the advent of chromatin changes, such as karyorrhexis and pyknosis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-09257-f002">Figure 2</xref>). This result, although not conclusive per se, was compatible with a process of programmed cell death. For this reason, we decided to assess the activity of caspase homologues, given the role and relevance of these serine proteases in several types of programmed cell deaths. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-09257-f003">Figure 3</xref>A, incubation of cells with 
 <bold>3b</bold> resulted in an about three-fold increase in caspase-like activity; this value increased to over six-fold in the case of 
 <bold>3e</bold>. For benchmarking purposes, the commercial insecticide chlorpyrifos was also evaluated, and its effect was not statistically different from control cells. This result is not completely unexpected, considering that chlorpyrifos belongs to the class of organophosphates pesticides, thus exerting its toxicity by disrupting the nervous system of the target organisms, specifically by irreversibly inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, leading to the build-up of acetylcholine levels [
 <xref rid="B37-ijms-21-09257" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Although death can ultimately occur in vivo, apoptosis is not the primary result of its effect. The fact that the eugenol derivatives described herein exert their effect via a distinct mechanism than organophosphates, which are known for their toxicity, is promising. Furthermore, in view of the chemical structures of the molecules presented here, eugenol derivatives are unlikely to inhibit acetylcholinesterase, which suggests that they may act through distinct mechanisms.
