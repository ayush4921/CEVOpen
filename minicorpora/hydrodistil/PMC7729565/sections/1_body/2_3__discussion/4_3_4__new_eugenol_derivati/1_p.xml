<p>Finally, the effect of the most promising molecules, 
 <bold>3b</bold> and 
 <bold>3e</bold>, was evaluated towards human cells. Considering the most frequent routes of contact with pesticides, we have chosen keratinocytes as a model, given their pivotal role in skin anatomy. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-09257-f003">Figure 3</xref>B, very distinct selectivity was found. Compound 
 <bold>3b</bold> caused around 40% loss of cell viability, which is still less than the effect elicited in insect cells. In the case of 
 <bold>3e</bold>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-09257-f003">Figure 3</xref>B shows that it had no effect in human cells at the same concentration in which it caused around 50% of cell viability loss, thus displaying a selective effect towards insect cells. Even more interesting is that this selective effect outperforms that of the commercial insecticide chlorpyrifos, which was highly toxic to keratinocytes and caused over 40% of viability loss.
