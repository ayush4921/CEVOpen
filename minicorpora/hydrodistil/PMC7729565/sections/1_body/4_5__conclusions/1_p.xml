<p>Overall, with the present work it was demonstrated that medicinal chemistry approaches are valid strategies for obtaining new semisynthetic derivatives of a natural essential oil, which can act as promising alternatives to the available synthetic insecticides. Having started with a natural molecule devoid of activity, eugenol 
 <bold>1</bold>, it was possible to obtain several molecules with enhanced activity, some of them highly potent at concentrations as low as 100 Î¼g/mL. The most potent molecules were shown to elicit morphological changes compatible with some processes of programmed cell death, being also capable of increasing the activity of serine proteases pivotal to some of these death pathways, notably caspases.
