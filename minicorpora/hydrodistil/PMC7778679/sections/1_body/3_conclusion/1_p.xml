<p>The main compounds of the EO of 
 <italic>C. nardus</italic> were found to be the oxygen-containing monoterpenes, citronellal, geranial, geraniol, citronellol, and neral. The ME+EO showed adequate technological properties, providing stability of the system and improvement of solubilization of the EO for incorporation in the ME. The EO and ME+EO exhibited effective in vitro and in vivo antifungal activity against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> and demonstrated possible actions on the ionic permeability of the fungal cell membrane. Moreover, the use of nanotechnology significantly improved the antifungal action of the EO, especially in an in vivo model of VVC, in which the ME+EO promoted the eradication of the fungal vaginal infection on the third day of treatment. These encouraging results suggest that the incorporation of the essential oil of 
 <italic>C. nardus</italic> in an ME can considerably enhance the antifungal action of the EO against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Additionally, EO extraction complies with the principles of green chemistry, being a viable process that facilitates the development and industrial-scale production of antifungal herbal medicines, based on citronella EO.
