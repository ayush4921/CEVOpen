<p>Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is the second most common cause of vaginitis after bacterial vaginosis, which highlights it as an important womenâ€™s health issue.
 <xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> According to Denning et al, 2018, 75% of women have had VVC at least once during their lives and recurrent episodes may occur, leading to recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC). Although VVC is not a lethal disease, quality of life is drastically affected, both socially and economically, especially in cases of RVVC, which is considered the chronic phase of the disease.
