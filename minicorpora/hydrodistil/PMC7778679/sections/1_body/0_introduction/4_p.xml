<p>Plants are an important therapeutic possibility for treating fungal infections. The essential oil (EO) of the leaves of 
 <italic>Cymbopogon nardus</italic> (L.) Rendle (citronella) is applied in cosmetic and perfumery industries and is used as an insect repellent. Geraniol, citral, citronellal and citronellol, the main chemical compounds from this EO, have various biological activities.
 <xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7â€“9</xref> Toledo et al (2016) reported the antifungal activity of the EO of 
 <italic>C. nardus</italic> against standard and clinical strains of 
 <italic>C. albicans, C. krusei, C. glabrata, C. tropicalis</italic>, and 
 <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic>. Moreover, the EO was able to inhibit the main virulence factors, such as hyphal formation, of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> and the mature biofilm of 
 <italic>Candida</italic> species. The advantages presented by plant extracts have stimulated research on the application of alternative methods to improve the antifungal activity of plant derivatives, such as the use of nanotechnology, which allows the enhancement of biological activity, the control of drug release, and a reduction of side effects.
