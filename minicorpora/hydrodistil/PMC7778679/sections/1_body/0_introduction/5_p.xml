<p>Microemulsions (MEs) are potential nanostructured drug delivery systems. MEs present characteristics such as transparent emulsions, in which an oil is dispersed in an aqueous medium (or vice versa), containing a surfactant associated with an appropriate co-surfactant. The system is a thermodynamically stable system and shows internal phase with droplets of nanometer order, thus improving drug solubilization.
