0: The different experimental groups are listed in  Table 1.
1: C. albicans ATCC 10231 was used in this study.
2: Initially, the pseudoestrus hormonal phase was induced in mice by subcutaneous administration (0.1 mL) of estradiol (Sigma-Aldrich) at a concentration of 2 mg/mL, at 6 and 3 days prior to infection (initial day).
3: On the initial day, 20 L of a  C. albicans suspension containing 2.5  10 8 cells/mL was inoculated into the vaginal environment.
4: At day 1, treatments (20 L administered/animal) were initialized (once/day) and additional treatments were administered on days 3, 5, and 7.
5: On days 2, 4, and 6, estradiol administration was continued to maintain the pseudoestrous phase.
6: On days 2, 4, 6, and 8, vaginal lavages were performed with PBS.
7: 15, 31 The infection was monitored by individual vaginal lavage of the mice (70 L of sterile PBS), with repeated aspiration, shaking, and subsequent plating on Sabouraud agar + chloramphenicol (Acumedia, Lansing, MI, USA) to determine the number CFUs.
8: After 48 h of incubation of the agar plates at 37C, the colonies were counted.
9: Colony counts are expressed as log CFU/mL.
10: 15, 31 The animals were euthanized in a CO 2 chamber.
