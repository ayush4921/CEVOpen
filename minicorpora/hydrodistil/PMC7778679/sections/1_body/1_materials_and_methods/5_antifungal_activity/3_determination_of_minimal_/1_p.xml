<p>To determine the minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC), an aliquot from each well that showed antifungal activity was plated on a Petri dish containing Sabouraud dextrose agar (DIFCO; BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). The tests were carried out in triplicate. MFC was defined as the lowest concentration of EO and ME+EO that prevented visible growth on the solid medium.
