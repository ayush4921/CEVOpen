0: The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of EO and ME+EO were determined using a microplate dilution technique, according to protocol M27-A3, 26 with some modifications.
1: Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium (0.1 mL) was added to a 96-well microplate and was inoculated with 0.1 mL of a fungal suspension containing 2.5  10 3 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL.
2: EO and ME+EO were tested at concentrations ranging from 7.8 to 500 g/mL.
3: Amphotericin B (AmB, Sigma-Aldrich) and fluconazole (Sigma-Aldrich) were used as positive controls.
4: Culture medium, yeast growth, EO, ME+EO, ME, and solvent were used as additional (sterility) controls.
5: Microplates were incubated at 37C for 48 h. After incubation, 20 L of an aqueous solution of 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride was added and the plates were incubated at 37C for 2 h. 27 All tests were performed in triplicate.
