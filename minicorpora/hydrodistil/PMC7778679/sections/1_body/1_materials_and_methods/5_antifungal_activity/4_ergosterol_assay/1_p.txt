0: The binding of EO and ME+EO to membrane ergosterol in  C. albicans was evaluated according to the method described by Peixoto et al 28 (2017).
1: Microplates were prepared according to protocol M27-A3, 26 with some modifications.
2: EO and ME+EO were evaluated at concentrations ranging from 5000 g/mL to 2.44 g/mL.
3: C. albicans (ATCC 102331 and CAV) suspensions (10 3 cells/mL) were prepared (100 L) in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 200 g/mL exogenous ergosterol.
4: Medium without exogenous ergosterol was used as a control.
5: Microplates were incubated at 35C and readings were performed after 2 d.
