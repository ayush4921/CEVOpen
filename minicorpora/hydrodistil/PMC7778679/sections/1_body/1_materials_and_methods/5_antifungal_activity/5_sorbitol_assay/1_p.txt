0: To evaluate the interactions of EO and ME+EO with the fungal cell wall, microplates were prepared as described in the MIC determination experiments, according to protocol M27-A3, 26 with some modifications.
1: EO and ME-EO were added to microplates at concentrations ranging from 1,000 g/mL to 0.48 g/mL.
2: One hundred microliters of  C. albicans (ATCC 102331 and CAV) suspensions (10 3 cells/mL), prepared in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 0.8 M sorbitol, were added.
3: Medium without sorbitol was used as a control.
4: Microplates were incubated at 35C and readings were performed after 2 and 7 d. 28
