0: Chemical analysis of EO from  C. nardus was performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), using a Shimadzu  GCMS-QP2010S gas chromatograph (mass detector: electron impact ionization; mass quadrupole analyzer), fitted with an Rtx-5ms capillary column (30 m x 0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 m; Shimadzu , Kyoto, Japan).
1: Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.00 mL/min (58.8 kPa) and a linear velocity of 36.8 cm/s.
2: The oven temperature program was 60246oC at 3oC/min for 62 min, the injector temperature was 240oC, the injection volume was 1 L, the splitting ratio was 1:20, the ionization energy was 50 eV (280oC), and the transfer line temperature was 250oC.
3: The EO was solubilized in hexane (chromatographic grade) at a ratio of 1:100 (v/v) and standard solutions were injected at concentrations of 5.0, 4.0, 3.0, 2.0, 1.0, 0.5, and 0.25 mg/mL.
4: EO compounds were identified by comparing acquired mass spectra (from chromatogram peaks) with reference spectra of the National Institute of Standards and Technology mass-spectral library version 2.0 (2012) and data from the literature.
5: Arithmetic retention indices 20 were calculated as previously described (Adams, 2007), by linear interpolation relative to the retention times ( tR) of a series of  n-alkanes (C8C20).
6: These values were compared with a published retention indices.
7: 21 Relative amounts of EO components were calculated using the chromatogram peak area normalization method.
8: The quantification of major EO compounds was performed using an analytical curve (external standard method), considering the commercial purity of each of the following standards (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA): citronellal (95.0%), citronellol (95.0%), and geraniol (95.0%).
