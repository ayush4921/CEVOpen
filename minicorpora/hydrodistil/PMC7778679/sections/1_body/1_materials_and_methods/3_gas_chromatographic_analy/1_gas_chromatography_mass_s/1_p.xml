<p>Chemical analysis of EO from 
 <italic>C. nardus</italic> was performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), using a Shimadzu
 <sup>®</sup> GCMS-QP2010S gas chromatograph (mass detector: electron impact ionization; mass quadrupole analyzer), fitted with an Rtx-5ms capillary column (30 m x 0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 µm; Shimadzu
 <sup>®</sup>, Kyoto, Japan). Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.00 mL/min (58.8 kPa) and a linear velocity of 36.8 cm/s. The oven temperature program was 60–246ºC at 3ºC/min for 62 min, the injector temperature was 240ºC, the injection volume was 1 µL, the splitting ratio was 1:20, the ionization energy was 50 eV (280ºC), and the transfer line temperature was 250ºC. The EO was solubilized in hexane (chromatographic grade) at a ratio of 1:100 (v/v) and standard solutions were injected at concentrations of 5.0, 4.0, 3.0, 2.0, 1.0, 0.5, and 0.25 mg/mL. EO compounds were identified by comparing acquired mass spectra (from chromatogram peaks) with reference spectra of the National Institute of Standards and Technology mass-spectral library version 2.0 (2012) and data from the literature. Arithmetic retention indices

 <italic>t</italic>
 <sub>R</sub>) of a series of 
 <italic>n</italic>-alkanes (C8–C20). These values were compared with a published retention indices.
 <xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Relative amounts of EO components were calculated using the chromatogram peak area normalization method. The quantification of major EO compounds was performed using an analytical curve (external standard method), considering the commercial purity of each of the following standards (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA): citronellal (95.0%), citronellol (95.0%), and geraniol (95.0%).
