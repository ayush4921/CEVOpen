0: The phase diagram development generated 36 formulations, mixing different concentrations of the constituents, but maintaining constant oil phase and surfactant proportions.
1: The mixtures were sonicated (Q500; QSonica, Newtown, CT, USA) with a potency of 500 watts and a 20% amplitude, in discontinuous mode for 7 min, with an interval of 30 s in an ice bath every 59 s. The EO (2000 g/mL) was loaded to the ME (ME+EO) by sonication for 30 s.
