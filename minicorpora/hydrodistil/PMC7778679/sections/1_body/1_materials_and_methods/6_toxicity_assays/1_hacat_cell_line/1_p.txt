0: Cytotoxicity assays were performed in the HaCat human keratinocyte cell line obtained from Banco de celulas do Rio de Janeiro (BCRJ: 0341), according to a previously described protocol 29 using the resazurin reduction method.
1: Cells (2.5  10 4 cells/mL) were added to a 96-well microplate (Costar, Cambridge, MA, USA) for 24 h. After this process, cells were treated with EO (from 7.8 to 1000 g/mL) or ME+EO (from 0.1 to 30 g/mL).
2: After 24 h of incubation, the medium was removed and 50 mL of resazurin, diluted to 0.01% in DMEM, was added.
3: The microplates were then incubated at 37C for 3 h. Fluorescence was measured using a Synergy H1 microplate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA) using an excitation wavelength of 530 nm and an emission wavelength of 590 nm.
4: Untreated cells (viable cells) were used as negative controls, cells treated with 5 g/mL doxorubicin (Sigma-Aldrich) were used as positive controls (dead cells), and 1% DMSO was used as the vehicle control.
5: Assays were performed in triplicate.
6: IC 50 values, which represent the concentrations required to inhibit 50% of cells, were calculated by regression analysis from a calibration curve.
