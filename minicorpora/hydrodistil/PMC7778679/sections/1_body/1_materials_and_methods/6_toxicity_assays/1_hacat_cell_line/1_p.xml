<p>Cytotoxicity assays were performed in the HaCat human keratinocyte cell line obtained from Banco de células do Rio de Janeiro (BCRJ: 0341), according to a previously described protocol
 <xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> using the resazurin reduction method. Cells (2.5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/mL) were added to a 96-well microplate (Costar, Cambridge, MA, USA) for 24 h. After this process, cells were treated with EO (from 7.8 to 1000 μg/mL) or ME+EO (from 0.1 to 30 μg/mL). After 24 h of incubation, the medium was removed and 50 mL of resazurin, diluted to 0.01% in DMEM, was added. The microplates were then incubated at 37°C for 3 h. Fluorescence was measured using a Synergy H1 microplate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA) using an excitation wavelength of 530 nm and an emission wavelength of 590 nm. Untreated cells (viable cells) were used as negative controls, cells treated with 5 µg/mL doxorubicin (Sigma-Aldrich) were used as positive controls (dead cells), and 1% DMSO was used as the vehicle control. Assays were performed in triplicate. IC
 <sub>50</sub> values, which represent the concentrations required to inhibit 50% of cells, were calculated by regression analysis from a calibration curve.
