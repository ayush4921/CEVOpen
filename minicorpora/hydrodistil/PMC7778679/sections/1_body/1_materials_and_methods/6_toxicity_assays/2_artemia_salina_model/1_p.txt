0: Brine shrimp cysts of  Artemia salina, for use in the conventional Artemia test, were acquired from  Artemia salina of RN, Natal, Brazil, produced by Flagner Sores de Souza.
1: In vitro toxicity was assessed using an  Artemia salina (brine shrimp) model, according to a previously described method (Parra et al 30, 2001), with some modifications.
2: Briefly, 25 mg of  A. salina cysts was incubated for 24 h in artificial saline water consisting of 23 g of NaCl, 11 g of MgCl 2.6H 2O, 4 g of Na 2SO 4, 1.3 g of CaCl 2.H 2O, and 0.7 g of KCl dissolved in 1000 mL of distilled water.
3: An oxygen pump was placed in the saline water and a light was coupled on top of the container to keep the temperature at 25C during the experiment.
4: After 24 h of incubation, the nauplii were fed with 0.6 g of  Saccharomyces cerevisiae and incubated for another 24 h.
