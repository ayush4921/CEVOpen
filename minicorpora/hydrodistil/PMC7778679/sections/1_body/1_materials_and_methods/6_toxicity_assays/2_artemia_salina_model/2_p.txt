0: The next day, a suspension of nauplii (1015 organisms/well) in a volume of 100 L of saline water was added to a 96-well microplate.
1: In a separate microplate, a serial dilution of the compounds was prepared with concentrations of EO and ME+EO ranging from 0.2 to 1000 g/mL.
2: The controls consisted of untreated nauplii (negative control), 2% DMSO (vehicle control), and potassium dichromate (positive control).
3: After 24 h of treatment, the plate was examined under a binocular stereoscopic microscope and the number of dead nauplii in each well was counted to calculate the median lethal concentration (LC 50).
4: Larvae were considered dead if they did not exhibit any internal or external movement during several seconds of observation.
