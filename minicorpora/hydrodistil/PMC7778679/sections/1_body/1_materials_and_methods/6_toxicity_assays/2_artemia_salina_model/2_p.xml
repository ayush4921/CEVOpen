<p>The next day, a suspension of nauplii (10–15 organisms/well) in a volume of 100 μL of saline water was added to a 96-well microplate. In a separate microplate, a serial dilution of the compounds was prepared with concentrations of EO and ME+EO ranging from 0.2 to 1000 µg/mL. The controls consisted of untreated nauplii (negative control), 2% DMSO (vehicle control), and potassium dichromate (positive control). After 24 h of treatment, the plate was examined under a binocular stereoscopic microscope and the number of dead nauplii in each well was counted to calculate the median lethal concentration (LC
 <sub>50</sub>). Larvae were considered dead if they did not exhibit any internal or external movement during several seconds of observation.
