0: Oscillatory rheometry was performed using the same parameters (rheometer, geometries, and temperature, 37.0  0.1C, to simulate the in vivo environment) as described for continuous shear rheometry.
1: To establish the viscoelastic region of the formulations, a stress scan was performed, resulting in an ideal frequency condition ranging from 1 to 10 Hz.
2: To perform a quantitative analysis of the dependence of G on the frequency, the exponent  n and  S were calculated using  eq 3, which indicates the structure of the systems obtained.
