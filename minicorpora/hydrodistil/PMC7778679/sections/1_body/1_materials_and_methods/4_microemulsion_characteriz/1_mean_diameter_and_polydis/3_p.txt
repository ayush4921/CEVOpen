0: The ME (without EO) and ME+EO were analyzed in the analysis chamber with a laser beam crossing throughout the dispersion.
1: The system was maintained at 25C, with a laser wavelength of 532 nm and the refractive index for each sample was analyzed according to the index observed.
2: Ten determinations of the mean diameter and the polydispersity index (PDI) of droplets of each sample were performed (n = 3).
3: This assay was performed after 24 h (T0) and 3 months (T3) of samples preparation in order to verify stability of formulations and possible alterations in particle diameter.
