0: An AR2000 pressure-controlled rheometer (TA Instruments, New Castle, DE, USA) was used for rheometry assays.
1: Analyses were performed in triplicate, using cone/plate (40 mm diameter at a 52 m gap) and plate/plate (40 mm diameter at a 200 m gap) geometry at 37.0  0.1C.
2: A controlled shear rate was used, ranging from 0 to 100 s 1, during 120 s (each step) with 10 s interval between curves.
3: The shear was minimal and equilibrated 1 min prior to each analysis and the formulations were applied to the bottom plate.
4: The consistency index and the flow index were determined using  eq 2 for a quantitative analysis of flow behavior.
