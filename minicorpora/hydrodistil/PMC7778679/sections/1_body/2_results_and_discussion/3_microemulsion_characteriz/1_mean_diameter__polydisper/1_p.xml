<p>The mean values and standard deviation of particle size and PDI for the ME and ME+EO are demonstrated in 
 <xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. According to Formariz et al
 <xref rid="cit0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> (2010) the particle size of MEs range from 10 to 250 nm. The results obtained in this study corroborate these data, since the particles sizes were 55.23 and 70.14 nm for the ME and ME+EO, respectively. Small differences in particle diameter size were observed between the ME and ME+EO, which suggested the incorporation of the EO in the ME. PDI is an index that evaluates the relative homogeneity of the particle sizes distributed in the sample.

 <xref rid="cit0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> Therefore, these results demonstrated that the ME and ME+EO were homogeneous. These data confirmed the results of a previous study of an ME containing orange oil, with varying oil concentrations of 20%, 25%, and 30%, which exhibited a particle size of 70 nm and an IPD of 0.22 nm.
