<p>An analysis of the ZP of the ME and ME+EO showed a negative charge, which is likely due to the presence of soy phosphatidylcholine in the system that may favor the negative potential because of free esters present in the lipid structure.
 <xref rid="cit0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> However, phosphatidylcholine provides a phosphate group (negative charge) and a choline group (positive charge), which can cancel out each other, generating a zero charge at neutral pH. Thus, the hydration layers, lipid headgroups, and water polarization are factors that can be considered as the cause of the negative ZP.
