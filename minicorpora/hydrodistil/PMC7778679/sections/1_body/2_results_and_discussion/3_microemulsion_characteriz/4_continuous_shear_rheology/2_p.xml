<p>These results are in agreement with the work of Ramos et al
 <xref rid="cit0024">24</xref> (2019), who showed that a methanolic extract of 
 <italic>Syngonanthus nitens</italic> loaded in a nanoemulsion showed pseudoplastic behavior and allowed effective application for vulvovaginal candidiasis treatment. Another study demonstrated the pseudoplastic behavior of multiple emulsions loaded with clotrimazole as an adequate topical (vaginal) delivery system, showing effective antifungal activity when compared to clotrimazole, a commercial antimycotic drug.
