<p>Continuous shear rheology data for the ME and ME+EO are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">Figure 4</xref>. The ascending (filled symbol) and descending curves (empty symbol) indicate the flow behavior of the formulations. 
 <xref rid="t0004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> shows the properties related to flow behavior (
 <italic>n</italic>) and consistency of the formulations (
 <italic>k</italic>). The ME and ME+EO demonstrated non-Newtonian characteristics, with pseudoplastic behavior (
 <italic>n</italic> &lt; 1). This result is relevant for the appropriate application of pseudoplastic formulations in the vaginal environment, since an increase in viscosity occurs under the application of shear stress; however, when the force is removed, the system structure returns to its initial properties.
