<p>The peaks of mucoadhesion of the ME and ME+EO are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Figure 5</xref>. There was no significant difference (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05) in mucoadhesion between the ME and ME+EO, indicating that, after incorporation of the EO in the ME, mucoadhesion remained stable. The formulations showed adequate mucoadhesion for use in an in vivo VVC assay, which was in agreement with the results of studies by Bonif√°cio et al
 <xref rid="cit0022">22</xref> (2015) and Ramos et al
 <xref rid="cit0024">24</xref> (2019), in which the mucoadhesivity of loaded vegetal extracts in nanoemulsioned formulations were suitable for application in in vivo vulvovaginal candidiasis studies.
