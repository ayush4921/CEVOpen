 <xref rid="t0009" ref-type="table">Table 9</xref> shows the results of fungal burden (CFU) from vaginal lavages collected at days 2, 4, 6, and 8. The EO of 
 <italic>C. nardus</italic> was found to have significant therapeutic activity against VVC caused by 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> in mice. All animals treated with ME+EO were cured on the third day of treatment (experimental day 5). Moreover, incorporation of the EO into an ME enhanced the antifungal action of the EO (free), which was able to eradicate fungal infection in 50% of the animals. In the positive infection, solvent, and ME control experimental groups, the infection remained constant on all days of treatment, with a high fungal load present in 100% of the animals.
