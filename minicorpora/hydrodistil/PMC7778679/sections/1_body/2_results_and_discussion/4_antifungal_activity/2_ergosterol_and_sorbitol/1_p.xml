 <xref rid="t0006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref> shows MIC values for EO, ME+EO, and AmB, in the absence and presence of exogenous ergosterol, against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> ATCC 10231 and CAV. The MIC values of EO and ME+EO increased 5-fold and 20-fold, respectively, in the presence of exogenous ergosterol. These results suggested that EO and ME+EO bound to ergosterol in the fungal membrane, which required higher concentrations of EO and ME+EO to promote fungal cell death, demonstrating action on the ionic permeability of the fungal cell membrane. The positive control (AmB) showed the same mode of action. The antifungal activities of EO and ME+EO are not related to the biosynthetic pathways of the cell wall, since the MIC values were maintained in the presence of sorbitol.
