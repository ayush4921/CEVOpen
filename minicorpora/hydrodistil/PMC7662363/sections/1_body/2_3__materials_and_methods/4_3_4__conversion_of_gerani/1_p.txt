0: One gram (1 g) of geraniol (98%, Sigma-Aldrich) was subjected to hydrodistillation in a Clevenger-type apparatus for 3 h using a 500 mL flask and approximately 250 mL of distilled water.
1: After this time, hydrolate was subjected to extraction with ethyl acetate (3  50 mL) and the organic phase was dried with anhydrous Na 2SO 4, concentrated under reduced pressure in a rotary evaporator (Buchi, Flawil, Switzerland), transferred to an amber glass bottle, carefully concentrated in nitrogen and stored in freezer (Electrolux, Curitiba, Brazil) until analysis by GC/MS.
2: To prove the conversion of geraniol to linalool, 7 mg of linalool (97%, Sigma-Aldrich, Sao Paulo, Brazil) was added to 3.33 mg/mL hydrolate solution (geraniol hydrodistillation solution, after conversion) and after GC/MS analysis was observed if peak of linalool increased.
