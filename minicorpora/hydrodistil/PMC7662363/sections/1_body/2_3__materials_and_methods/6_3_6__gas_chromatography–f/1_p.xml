<p>Semiquantitative analysis of the chemical constituents was performed by flame ionization gas chromatography (FID), using a Shimadzu GC-17A (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) equipment, under the following operational conditions: capillary ZB-5MS column (5% phenyl-arylene-95%-dimethylpolysiloxane) fused silica capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d. × 0.25 μm film thickness) from Phenomenex (Torrance, CA, USA), under the same conditions GC/MS. Quantification of each constituent was estimated by area normalization (%). Concentrations of compounds were calculated from the GC peak areas and they were arranged in order of GC elution.</p>
