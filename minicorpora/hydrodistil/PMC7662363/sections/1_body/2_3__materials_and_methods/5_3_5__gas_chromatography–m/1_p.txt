0: Essential oil analysis was performed on a Shimadzu QP5050A (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) mass spectrometry system interfaced to gas chromatograph 17A instrument (GC/MS), employing the following conditions: column J&W Scientific DB-5MS (Folsom, CA, USA) fused silica capillary column (30 cm  0.25 mm i.d.
1: 0.25 m film thickness) composed of (5%-phenyl)-methylpolysiloxane, operating in electron impact mode at 70 eV; helium (99.999%) was used as carrier gas at a constant flow of 1.2 mL min 1 and an injection volume of 1.0 L was employed (split ratio of 1:83) injector temperature 250 C; interface temperature 280 C. The oven temperature was programmed from 50 C (isothermal for 2 min), with an increase of 4 C/min, to 200 C, then 10 C/min to 300 C, ending with a 10 min isothermal at 300 C. Mass spectra were taken at 70 eV; a scan interval of 0.5 s and fragments from 40 to 550 Da.
