0: Identification of individual constituents was performed by computerized matching of the acquired mass spectra with those stored in NIST21 and NIST107 mass spectral library of the GC/MS data system.
1: A linear hydrocarbon mixture of hydrocarbons (C 9H 20C 19H 40) was injected under these same conditions and identification of constituents was then performed by comparing the spectra obtained with those of the equipment data bank and by retention indices (RI) for all compounds which were obtained with an equation proposed by Van den Dool and Kratz (1963) [ 26] for each constituent, as previously described [ 27].
