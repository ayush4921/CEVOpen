<p>Sixty grams (60 g) of fresh leaves were transferred to volumetric flask. The flask was connected to Porapak Q trap, which was connected in turn to air pump (

 <xref rid="B9-molecules-25-04923" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The traps were prepared by packing Porapak Q (ca. 40 mg, 80–100 mesh Supelco) between silanized glass wool plugs in the glass tube which was packaged passing 6 mL MeOH (HPL grade) and 6 mL hexane (HPLC grade). A flow of air (ca. 0.5 L.min
 <sup>−1</sup>) was passed through the flasks containing the samples. Trapped volatiles were desorbed by solvent extraction (performed in triplicate) using hexane (1 mL, HPLC grade) by preliminary tests and applied a tone end of the column, and the solvent containing the eluted volatiles was forced to the other end of the column. The solvent volume was reduced carefully to approximately 200 µL in flow of nitrogen and an aliquot (1 µL) was immediately injected into the GC/MS and GC/FID.
