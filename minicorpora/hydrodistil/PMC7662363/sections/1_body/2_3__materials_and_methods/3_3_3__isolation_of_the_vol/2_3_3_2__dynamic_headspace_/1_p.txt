0: Sixty grams (60 g) of fresh leaves were transferred to volumetric flask.
1: The flask was connected to Porapak Q trap, which was connected in turn to air pump ( Figure 5) [ 9].
2: The traps were prepared by packing Porapak Q (ca.
3: 40 mg, 80100 mesh Supelco) between silanized glass wool plugs in the glass tube which was packaged passing 6 mL MeOH (HPL grade) and 6 mL hexane (HPLC grade).
4: A flow of air (ca.
5: 0.5 L.min 1) was passed through the flasks containing the samples.
6: Trapped volatiles were desorbed by solvent extraction (performed in triplicate) using hexane (1 mL, HPLC grade) by preliminary tests and applied a tone end of the column, and the solvent containing the eluted volatiles was forced to the other end of the column.
7: The solvent volume was reduced carefully to approximately 200 L in flow of nitrogen and an aliquot (1 L) was immediately injected into the GC/MS and GC/FID.
