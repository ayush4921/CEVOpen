<p>The relative extraction efficiencies with four preliminary solvents methylene chloride, methanol, ethyl acetate and n-hexane were investigated. The extraction of VOCs (performed in triplicate) by the technique of dynamic headspace were based on the solubility of peat in these solvents, and solutions were prepared separately in 80 mg of peat dissolved in 10 mL in the respective solvents. Only the n-hexane did not break the peat. Thus, this solvent was used for desorption of volatiles.</p>
