0: To our knowledge there are no reports on the extraction of volatile compounds from geranium by dynamic headspace using Porapak Q and in natura peat as adsorbents.
1: Therefore, the aim of the research was determining the chemical composition of volatiles from fresh leaves of geranium ( P. graveolens) by HSD-T and HSD-P as the adsorbent material and compare it with those obtained by hydrodistillation (HD).
