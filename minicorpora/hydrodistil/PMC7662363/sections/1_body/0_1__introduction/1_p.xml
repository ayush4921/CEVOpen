 <italic>Pelargonium</italic> is one of the five genera of the Geraniaceae family and contains about 280 species that are particularly rich in volatile oils, perennial aromatic crops of South African origin. A number of 
 <italic>Pelargonium</italic> species (i.e., 
 <italic>P. graveolens, P. capitatum, P. zonale, P. roseum, P. odoratissimum</italic>, and related hybrids) provide a highly marketed rose-scented essential oil, rich in citronellol and geraniol, obtained by steam distillation from fresh leaves and branches. The essential oil is mainly known under the generic name of “Geranium oil” even if obtained from distinct
