<p>In HSD analysis, the sample is confined in an entrainment chamber and a carrier gas is passed over the sample. The VOCs released by the sample are carried by the gas to a solid trap, usually a porous organic polymer adsorbent such as Porapak Q (ethylvinylbenzene-divinylbenzene), where the analytes are adsorbed and preconcentrated. Trapped VOCs can be eluted from the adsorbing matrix into glass vials with thermal desorption, pure solvents or mixtures of low-boiling-point organic solvents. The merits of techniques for sampling the headspace for recovery of volatile compounds associated with the aroma has been known for some time and become a preferred method for capturing volatile [
