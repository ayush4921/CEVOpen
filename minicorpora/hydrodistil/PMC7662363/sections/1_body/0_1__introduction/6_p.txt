0: During recent years, research on new materials for extraction, purification and separation processes of organic compounds in a wide polarity range has also been proposed by the growing interest for environmental preservation and human health protection.
1: In view of this, peat is a sedentarily accumulated material consisting of dead organic matter in the waterlogged environment.
2: Due to their high content of humic substances, natural peat exhibits favorable physicochemical properties enabling the application in various technical areas, for instance wastewater treatment, pollution monitoring, fuel production, soil fertilizing, and veterinary and human medicine [ 16, 17].
3: Peat, as an adsorbent, is a porous material which can adsorb large quantities of metals, dyes and other organic molecules, whose adsorption capacity is comparable to conventional extracting phase like activated carbon, silica or alumina [ 18, 19].
4: According to Mohan and Pittman [ 20], the price of peat is USD 0.09 kg 1, while the commercial price of Porapak Q is USD 4.56 g 1 [ 21].
5: Thus, peat is more economically viable if used for both analytical and industrial purposes.
