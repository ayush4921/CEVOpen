0: In HSD analysis, the sample is confined in an entrainment chamber and a carrier gas is passed over the sample.
1: The VOCs released by the sample are carried by the gas to a solid trap, usually a porous organic polymer adsorbent such as Porapak Q (ethylvinylbenzene-divinylbenzene), where the analytes are adsorbed and preconcentrated.
2: Trapped VOCs can be eluted from the adsorbing matrix into glass vials with thermal desorption, pure solvents or mixtures of low-boiling-point organic solvents.
3: The merits of techniques for sampling the headspace for recovery of volatile compounds associated with the aroma has been known for some time and become a preferred method for capturing volatile [ 7, 8].
4: Volatiles extracted are identified by gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GC/MS) and can be semiquantificated by gas chromatographyflame ionization (GC/FID) [ 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15].
