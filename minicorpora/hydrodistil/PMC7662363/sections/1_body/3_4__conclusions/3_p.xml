<p>Identification and quantification of the volatile composition of 
 <italic>P. graveolens</italic> by dynamic headspace, using peat as an adsorbent, were never carried out previously. Finally, considering that one of the objectives of this work was studying the scientific feasibility of alternative materials in the extraction of volatile plants, we emphasize that the peat can be used for the extraction of volatile compounds from leaves of geranium.
