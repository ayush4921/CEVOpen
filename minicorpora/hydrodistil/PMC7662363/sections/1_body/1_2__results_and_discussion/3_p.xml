<p>VOCs were obtained by HD from fresh leaves of 
 <italic>P. graveolens</italic>, which gave an oil in 0.15% yield based on fresh weight. Comparative total ion chromatogram (TIC) of the components identified at the three different extraction methods, HD, HSD-P and HSD-T, showed differences in volatile composition. Gas chromatographyâ€“flame ionization (GC/FID) normalized peak areas of the components identified are shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04923-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. These VOCs can be classified into several chemical groups: monoterpenes hydrocarbons, oxygenated monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes hydrocarbons and esters. Oxygenated monoterpenes were present in the highest percentage in the three methods (65.50% in HD, 66.32% in HSD-T and 38.69% in HSD-P), while monoterpenes hydrocarbons were the minority (2.72% in HSD-T and 5.92% in HSD-P, respectively). Esters were the majority groups by HD and sesquiterpenes hydrocarbons (37.95%) by HSD-P. According to the literature, citronellol, geraniol, linalool and citronellyl formate are the main components present in the essential oil from fresh leaves of geranium obtained by HD [

Linalool (11.19%) and citronellyl formate (9.41%) had highest percentage by HD compared to HSD-T (not detected linalool and 1.92% citronellyl formate) and HSD-P (0.68% and 6.95%, respectively),
