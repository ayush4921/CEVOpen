 <xref rid="B25-molecules-25-04923" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] analyzed volatile compounds from the leaves of six species of 
 <italic>Juglans</italic> and 
 <italic>Carya</italic> by headspace dynamic using Tenax as adsorbent and hexane as eluting solvent and they found quantitative and qualitative differences among species. According to them, sesquiterpenes were the majority in all species studied and monoterpenes were detected at high levels in three from the six species under study, however, no work was performed using dynamic headspace and Porapak Q as an adsorbent for the extraction of volatile geranium. Peat also had never been used as an adsorbent for the extraction of plant volatiles.
