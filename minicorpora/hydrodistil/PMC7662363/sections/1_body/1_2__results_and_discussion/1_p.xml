<p>Previous work [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-25-04923" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] shows that peat from Santo Amaro das Brotas municipality, Sergipe state, northeastern Brazil, is rich in C (53.1%), H (6.0%), O (31.5%) and dry ash (9.4%). Typical compositions of peat are in the range 40–60% C and 4–6% H
 <sub>2</sub>O. The elemental ratios H/C (1.3) and O/C (0.4) are indicators for the percentage saturation of the C atoms within the organic molecule and of the carbohydrate content, respectively [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-25-04923" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Lower H/C ratios indicate higher aromaticity in the samples. The lowest O/C ratio of the peat sample indicates the lowest carbohydrate level and/or the highest organic content of that peat sample. The estimated value of the organic matter was 96% for the peat sample [
