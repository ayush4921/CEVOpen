<p>Gomes et al. [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-25-04923" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] applied the method of supercritical fluid extraction (EFS), a clean technology for the extraction of essential oil of geranium, and compared it with the extract obtained by HD, achieving low relative concentration of linalool by EFS in relation to the extraction by HD. The authors attributed this difference to linalool being formed through the geraniol when subjected to high temperatures in the presence of water vapor. This hypothesis was proven for the extraction methods used in this work, according

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04923-f004">Figure 4</xref>. Proposed mechanism for conversion of geraniol to linalool is initiated by the capture of proton of the hydronium ion. Then, water is eliminated as a leaving group, generating the geranyl cation that isomerizes to form a tertiary carbocation. In the next steps, the formation of a C–O bond occurs by the nucleophilic attack of the water, deprotonation and rotation of the C–C sigma bond to form linalool (
