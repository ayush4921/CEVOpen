<p>Comparison of in natura pea as an adsorbent with Porapak Q available commercially showed that peat has a similar extracting power for 
 <italic>γ</italic>-muurolene, and is better for geraniol, geranyl tiglate and limonene (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Dry ash, when used as an adsorbent, was unsatisfactory (data not shown). This fact shows that organic fraction is responsible for adsorption of the VOCs. In earlier work undertaken using the same peat that was employed in the present study, Romão et al. [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-25-04923" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] demonstrated the presence of large quantities of aliphatic compounds. The interactions of organic compounds on material surfaces are not fully understood, it is generally acknowledged that the aromatic and aliphatic fractions of these adsorbents accumulate non-polar organic compounds, which are adsorbed by nonspecific attraction such as hydrophobic interactions [
