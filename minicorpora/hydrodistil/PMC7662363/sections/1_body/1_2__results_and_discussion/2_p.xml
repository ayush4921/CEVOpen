<p>Detailed examination of the mineralogy of peat sample using X-ray diffraction (XRD) shows that it is characteristic of amorphous matter with a hump between 18° and 32° [

 <xref rid="B23-molecules-25-04923" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] analyzing the processes involved in peat formation, recognized an anaerobic thick structural layer, which is formed of residual material from the original plant structure, decay products and new substances produced mainly by bacteria. At this level, peat would be amorphous and highly humified. However, only the XRD of dry ash or residue of that sample revealed mineral characteristics with presence of quartz mineral and some clay material. The combination of the elemental analyses and XRD indicates that the peat studied is highly humified and rich in organic compounds.
