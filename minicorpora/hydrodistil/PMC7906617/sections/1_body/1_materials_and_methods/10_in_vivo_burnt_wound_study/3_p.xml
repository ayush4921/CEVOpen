<p>The animals were maintained under a standard laboratory-controlled environment with free access to food and water and kept in the same conditions for at least three days before the experiment. The hot water method was used to produce burn injury (Chang et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). A total of 15 rats were divided into five groups with three rats in each group. Group 1 received no treatment (negative control), group 2 received cinnamon oil dispersed in inert carrier olive oil, group 3 received NLC-cinnamon colloid, group 4 received NLC blank gel, and group 5 received NLC-cinnamon oil gel. The dorsal hairs of all rats were shaved by clipping and disinfected the shaved area with 70% alcohol one day before the experiment. Animals were weighed and anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine before the burning procedure. A rubber sheet with a 2 cm circle opening was covered on the shaved dorsal skin. Rats were carried with the dorsal side down and immersed the exposed circular skin part into boiling water underneath for 10 s to induce a third-degree burn (Selcuk et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Thereafter, a suspension containing approximately 7.5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> colony forming units/ml (CFU/ml) 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> was inoculated through an injection under the wound area. Animals were kept individually in separate cages and fed with a standard rat diet and water for two days before starting the treatment.
