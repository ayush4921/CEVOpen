0: The animals were maintained under a standard laboratory-controlled environment with free access to food and water and kept in the same conditions for at least three days before the experiment.
1: The hot water method was used to produce burn injury (Chang et al.,  2020).
2: A total of 15 rats were divided into five groups with three rats in each group.
3: Group 1 received no treatment (negative control), group 2 received cinnamon oil dispersed in inert carrier olive oil, group 3 received NLC-cinnamon colloid, group 4 received NLC blank gel, and group 5 received NLC-cinnamon oil gel.
4: The dorsal hairs of all rats were shaved by clipping and disinfected the shaved area with 70% alcohol one day before the experiment.
5: Animals were weighed and anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine before the burning procedure.
6: A rubber sheet with a 2 cm circle opening was covered on the shaved dorsal skin.
7: Rats were carried with the dorsal side down and immersed the exposed circular skin part into boiling water underneath for 10 s to induce a third-degree burn (Selcuk et al.,  2012).
8: Thereafter, a suspension containing approximately 7.5  10 5 colony forming units/ml (CFU/ml)  P. aeruginosa was inoculated through an injection under the wound area.
9: Animals were kept individually in separate cages and fed with a standard rat diet and water for two days before starting the treatment.
