<p>Two novel excipients Precirol ATO 5 and Labrafac™ lipophile WL 1349 were used to advance the formulation carrier. Labrafac is a mixture of medium-chain triglyceride and it is derived from vegetal origin and liquid at room temperature (Nanoscale, 2018). NSC-cinnamon oil was prepared according to the method described by Teng et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) with modification of temperature being 60 °C for both lipid and aqueous phases which were then stirred vigorously with a high-speed homogenizer (IKA T25, Digital ULTRA TURRAX
 <sup>®</sup>, Königswinter, Germany) at 20,000 rpm for 10 min and followed by sonification in a water bath sonicator for 5 min at 1500 W (Shyam Industries, Ahmedabad, India). The prepared NSCs were further continuously stirred at 100 rpm overnight at room temperature. The formulation compositions were presented in
