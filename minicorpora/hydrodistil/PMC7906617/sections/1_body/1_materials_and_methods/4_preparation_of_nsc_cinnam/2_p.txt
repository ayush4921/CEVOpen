0: Two novel excipients Precirol ATO 5 and LabrafacTM lipophile WL 1349 were used to advance the formulation carrier.
1: Labrafac is a mixture of medium-chain triglyceride and it is derived from vegetal origin and liquid at room temperature (Nanoscale, 2018).
2: NSC-cinnamon oil was prepared according to the method described by Teng et al.
3: ( 2019) with modification of temperature being 60 C for both lipid and aqueous phases which were then stirred vigorously with a high-speed homogenizer (IKA T25, Digital ULTRA TURRAX , Konigswinter, Germany) at 20,000 rpm for 10 min and followed by sonification in a water bath sonicator for 5 min at 1500 W (Shyam Industries, Ahmedabad, India).
4: The prepared NSCs were further continuously stirred at 100 rpm overnight at room temperature.
5: The formulation compositions were presented in  Table 1.
