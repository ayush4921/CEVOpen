0: The experimental burn skin area of each rat was dissected immediately after sacrifice.
1: The specimens of the cutaneous tissues including epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous portions, from all groups, were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin, dehydrated with an ascending ethanol gradient, cleared using xylol, and embedded in paraffin to form formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded blocks (FFPE).
2: The blocks were cut into 5 m sections then stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E).
3: The sections were examined using different magnifications of the light microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) and photographed (Wen et al.,  2014).
