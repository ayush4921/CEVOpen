0: The entrapment efficiency (EE%) of the cinnamon oil in NLC was determined indirectly by measuring the concentration of free cinnamon oil in the NLC-cinnamon oil colloid using a Spin-pure filter (MWCO 10 kDa, Sera Care, Portland, ME).
1: Accurately measured 100 l NLC was diluted with 400 l distilled water to remove unentrapped drugs that were deposited on the NLC surface.
2: A total of 500 l of this diluted sample mixture was transferred to the upper chamber of the filter tube which was then placed in a rotor and spun under ultracentrifugation at 20,000 rpm for 45 min at 4 C. The filtrate collected in the bottom chamber was analyzed by UV-VIS spectrophotometry (Shimadzu UV-1800, Kyoto, Japan) to determine the unentrapped drug concentration.
3: The detection wavelength was 293 nm.
4: The EE% was calculated using the following equation.
5: EE (%) = (total amount of drug in NLC  free drug/total amount of drug in NLC)  100.
6: All measurements were performed in triplicate.
