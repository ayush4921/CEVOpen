<p>The entrapment efficiency (EE%) of the cinnamon oil in NLC was determined indirectly by measuring the concentration of free cinnamon oil in the NLC-cinnamon oil colloid using a Spin-pure filter (MWCO 10 kDa, Sera Care, Portland, ME). Accurately measured 100 µl NLC was diluted with 400 µl distilled water to remove unentrapped drugs that were deposited on the NLC surface. A total of 500 µl of this diluted sample mixture was transferred to the upper chamber of the filter tube which was then placed in a rotor and spun under ultracentrifugation at 20,000 rpm for 45 min at 4 °C. The filtrate collected in the bottom chamber was analyzed by UV-VIS spectrophotometry (Shimadzu UV-1800, Kyoto, Japan) to determine the unentrapped drug concentration. The detection wavelength was 293 nm. The EE% was calculated using the following equation. EE (%) = (total amount of drug in NLC – free drug/total amount of drug in NLC) × 100. All measurements were performed in triplicate.</p>
