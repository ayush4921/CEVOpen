0: Envisioning of the nanoparticle shape and surface characteristics of the prepared NLCs were performed using TEM (Joel JEM 1230, Tokyo, Japan).
1: The diluted dispersion is negatively stained using a saturated solution of uranyl acetate for 5 min, followed by loading the stained formulation on a copper grid.
2: A drying step of the copper grid lasted for 10 min at 25 C followed by examination under the transmission electron microscope.
