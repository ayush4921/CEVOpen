<p>The release study was carried out using a shaking incubator (WiseCube
 <sup>®</sup> WIS Precise Shaking Incubator, Wertheim, Germany) adjusted at 50 rpm (35 ± 0.5 °C) for five days. Each formulation (2 ml) was loaded into a dialysis membrane bag (MWCO 12–14 kDa, Spectra/por
 <sup>®</sup> Spectrum Laboratories Inc., Rancho Dominguez, CA) with both ends closed by a thread and hanged on a beaker containing 400 ml release media of phosphate buffer pH 7.4 in which 30% absolute ethanol was added to ensure the sink condition for drug release. All membrane bags were immersed in the release media. The prepared beakers were positioned in the holders and gently shaken at a set speed in the incubator. One ml of released sample was withdrawn at the predetermined time intervals and replaced immediately by an equal volume of fresh, pre-warmed medium to maintain a constant receptor volume. Samples were suitably diluted and analyzed for the drug concentration by UV–Vis spectrophotometry at a wavelength of 293 nm. The amount of drug released was calculated according to the calibration curve equation (
