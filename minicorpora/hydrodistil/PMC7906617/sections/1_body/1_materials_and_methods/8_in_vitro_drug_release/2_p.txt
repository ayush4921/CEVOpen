0: The release study was carried out using a shaking incubator (WiseCube  WIS Precise Shaking Incubator, Wertheim, Germany) adjusted at 50 rpm (35  0.5 C) for five days.
1: Each formulation (2 ml) was loaded into a dialysis membrane bag (MWCO 1214 kDa, Spectra/por  Spectrum Laboratories Inc., Rancho Dominguez, CA) with both ends closed by a thread and hanged on a beaker containing 400 ml release media of phosphate buffer pH 7.4 in which 30% absolute ethanol was added to ensure the sink condition for drug release.
2: All membrane bags were immersed in the release media.
3: The prepared beakers were positioned in the holders and gently shaken at a set speed in the incubator.
4: One ml of released sample was withdrawn at the predetermined time intervals and replaced immediately by an equal volume of fresh, pre-warmed medium to maintain a constant receptor volume.
5: Samples were suitably diluted and analyzed for the drug concentration by UVVis spectrophotometry at a wavelength of 293 nm.
6: The amount of drug released was calculated according to the calibration curve equation ( Y = 0.087 X + 0.0234,  R2 = 0.9907).
7: The dilution caused by the replenish media of each sample was corrected using a relevant equation.
8: Triplicate data were collected and their means were plotted against time (Raafat & El-Zahaby,  2020).
