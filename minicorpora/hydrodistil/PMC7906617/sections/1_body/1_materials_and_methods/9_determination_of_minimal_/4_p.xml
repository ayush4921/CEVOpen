<p>Broth microdilution method under standardized 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions was used to measure the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the formulations using a 96-well microdilution tray (Grianer, Pleidelsheim, Germany) with twofold drug-dilution steps. The growth of bacteria was visually evaluated according to the clearness of the solution (Abozahra et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The pure cinnamon oil, pure gel, NLC blank gel, NLC-cinnamon colloid, and NLC-cinnamon oil gel, 2.5 mg/ml of each was twofold serially diluted with sterile nutrient broth, and then, 200 µl of each sample was transferred to the well of the microtiter tray. Ten µl of diluted broth cultures of 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> adjusted the bacterial suspension turbidity reaching a final inoculum of 0.5 McFarland turbidity standard which was transferred into each well. The microtiter tray was then incubated in the darkness at 37 °C for 24 hours, followed by visual inspection for bacterial growth by turbidity. Inoculated and uninoculated wells containing samples free of nutrient broth were used as controls to check the effect of the broth on the growth of the organism and the sterility. MIC value is the lowest concentration of each tested sample that inhibits the visible growth of 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (Jorgensen &amp; Ferraro, 
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Limbago, 
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). These tests were performed in all five strains of clinical isolates.
