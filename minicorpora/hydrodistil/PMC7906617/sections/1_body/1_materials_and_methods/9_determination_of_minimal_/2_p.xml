The isolation was approved by the ethical committee at the High Institute of Public Health, Alexandria University. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using the disc diffusion method, antibiotic discs tested were Meropenem (MEM, 10 μg), Ampicillin/sulbactam (SAM, 10/10 μg), Amoxicillin/Clavulanate (AMC, 10/10 μg), Ciprofloxacin (CIP, 5 μg), Cefepime (FEP, 30 μg), Cefoperazone (CFP, 75 μg), Cefotaxime (CTX, 30 μg), Ceftriaxone (CRO, 30 μg), Piperacillin (PIP, 100 μg), Imipenem (IPM, 10 μg), Gentamicin (CN, 10 μg), Tetracycline (TE, 30 μg), Levofloxacin (LEV, 5 μg), Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX, 1.25/23.75 μg), Chloramphenicol (C, 30 μg), Amikacin (AMK, 30 μg), Aztreonam (ATM, 30 μg), Ceftazidime (CAZ, 30 μg) (Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK), and Colistin (CL, 10 μg) (Himedia, Mumbai, India) to all isolates. Obtained values were interpreted according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute into sensitive, intermediate, and resistant categories.
