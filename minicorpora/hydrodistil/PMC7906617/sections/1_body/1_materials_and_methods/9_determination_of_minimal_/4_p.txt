0: Broth microdilution method under standardized  in vitro conditions was used to measure the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the formulations using a 96-well microdilution tray (Grianer, Pleidelsheim, Germany) with twofold drug-dilution steps.
1: The growth of bacteria was visually evaluated according to the clearness of the solution (Abozahra et al.,  2020).
2: The pure cinnamon oil, pure gel, NLC blank gel, NLC-cinnamon colloid, and NLC-cinnamon oil gel, 2.5 mg/ml of each was twofold serially diluted with sterile nutrient broth, and then, 200 l of each sample was transferred to the well of the microtiter tray.
3: Ten l of diluted broth cultures of  Pseudomonas aeruginosa adjusted the bacterial suspension turbidity reaching a final inoculum of 0.5 McFarland turbidity standard which was transferred into each well.
4: The microtiter tray was then incubated in the darkness at 37 C for 24 hours, followed by visual inspection for bacterial growth by turbidity.
5: Inoculated and uninoculated wells containing samples free of nutrient broth were used as controls to check the effect of the broth on the growth of the organism and the sterility.
6: MIC value is the lowest concentration of each tested sample that inhibits the visible growth of  P. aeruginosa (Jorgensen & Ferraro,  2009; Limbago,  2019).
7: These tests were performed in all five strains of clinical isolates.
