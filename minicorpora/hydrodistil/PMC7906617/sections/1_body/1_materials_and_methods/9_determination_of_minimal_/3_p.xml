<p>The antibiotic susceptibility profile for all strains is shown in 
 <xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. All 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> isolates were resistant with varied resistance degrees for the tested antibiotics. The five isolated strains selected were multidrug-resistant and inoculated into the Luria-Bertani broth media with 30% glycerol and stored at −80 °C for later analysis.
