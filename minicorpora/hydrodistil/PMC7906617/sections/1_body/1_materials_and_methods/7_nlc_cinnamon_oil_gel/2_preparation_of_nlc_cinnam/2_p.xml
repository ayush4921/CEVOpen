<p>NLC-cinnamon oil gel was prepared by a ‘cold’ method using thermosensitive Poloxamer 407 as a gelling agent (Wen et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). A concentration of 20% w/w NLC gel was selected according to a preliminary study of the gel concentration and desired formulation viscosity (data not shown). To prepare 20% w/w control and formulation gels, 10 g of Poloxamer 407 was dispersed in 50 g deionized water or NLC colloid and mechanical, slowly stirred at 100 rpm for two hours at room temperature until a homogeneous dispersion was obtained. The mixture was stored in the refrigerator at 4 °C for 24 hours to ensure complete dissolution due to its characteristic gelation phenomenon which is dependent on the sol–gel transition temperature (Tsol–gel). Below Tsol–gel, Poloxamer 407 aqueous solution is in solution form and turns into gel above this temperature (Dumortier et al.,
