0: NLC-cinnamon oil gel was prepared by a cold method using thermosensitive Poloxamer 407 as a gelling agent (Wen et al.,  2012).
1: A concentration of 20% w/w NLC gel was selected according to a preliminary study of the gel concentration and desired formulation viscosity (data not shown).
2: To prepare 20% w/w control and formulation gels, 10 g of Poloxamer 407 was dispersed in 50 g deionized water or NLC colloid and mechanical, slowly stirred at 100 rpm for two hours at room temperature until a homogeneous dispersion was obtained.
3: The mixture was stored in the refrigerator at 4 C for 24 hours to ensure complete dissolution due to its characteristic gelation phenomenon which is dependent on the solgel transition temperature (Tsolgel).
4: Below Tsolgel, Poloxamer 407 aqueous solution is in solution form and turns into gel above this temperature (Dumortier et al.,  2006).
