0: The apparent viscosities of the formulations were evaluated at 22.2  0.5 C using a Brookfield RV DV-II + pro viscometer equipped with a small sample adaptor.
1: Each sample of 8 ml was introduced carefully into the adaptor chamber to avoid entrapping air bubbles.
2: The selected spindle (S15) was lowered into the sample and rotated at various speeds from 50 to 200 rpm for at least 2 min before each reading was taken.
3: Viscosity was calculated as a mean value of three measurements in centipoise (cP).
