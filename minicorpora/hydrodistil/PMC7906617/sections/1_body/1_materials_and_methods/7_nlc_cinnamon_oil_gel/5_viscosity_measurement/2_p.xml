<p>The apparent viscosities of the formulations were evaluated at 22.2 ± 0.5 °C using a Brookfield RV DV-II + pro viscometer equipped with a small sample adaptor. Each sample of 8 ml was introduced carefully into the adaptor chamber to avoid entrapping air bubbles. The selected spindle (S15) was lowered into the sample and rotated at various speeds from 50 to 200 rpm for at least 2 min before each reading was taken. Viscosity was calculated as a mean value of three measurements in centipoise (cP).</p>
