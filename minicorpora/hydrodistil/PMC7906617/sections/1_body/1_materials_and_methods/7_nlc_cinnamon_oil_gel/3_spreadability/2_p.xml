<p>The spreadability test was determined using the same method reported by Ibrahim et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). A glass slide was first marked with a 1 cm diameter circle. Then, 0.1 g of the tested gel was transferred to the center of the circle and covered with another glass slide. This sandwiched glass piece was warmed on a hot surface with a temperature of 32 ± 0.84 °C. A metal balance weight (500 g) was topped over the glass cover for 5 min. The expanded circle diameter was recorded. The spreadability of the gel was determined by the difference in the diameters of circles due to the spreading of the gel. All measurements were performed in triplicate.
