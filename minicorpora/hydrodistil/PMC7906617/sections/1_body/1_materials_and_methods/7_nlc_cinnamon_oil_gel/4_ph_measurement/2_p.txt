0: The pH of the pure gel, blank NLC gel, and NLC-cinnamon oil gel was measured using a digital glass electrode-based pH meter (Schott Gerate, Mainz, Germany) standardized using pH 4 and pH 7 buffers before use.
1: Each sample (0.5 g) was diluted with deionized water and dispersed uniformly before the measurement.
2: In each measurement, the electrode was immersed into the sample for 10 min to reach a steady reading.
3: The experiments were performed in triplicate at room temperature.
