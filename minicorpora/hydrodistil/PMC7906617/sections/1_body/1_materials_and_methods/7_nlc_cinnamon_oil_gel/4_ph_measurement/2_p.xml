<p>The pH of the pure gel, blank NLC gel, and NLC-cinnamon oil gel was measured using a digital glass electrode-based pH meter (Schott Geräte, Mainz, Germany) standardized using pH 4 and pH 7 buffers before use. Each sample (0.5 g) was diluted with deionized water and dispersed uniformly before the measurement. In each measurement, the electrode was immersed into the sample for 10 min to reach a steady reading. The experiments were performed in triplicate at room temperature.</p>
