<p>A 2
 <sup>4</sup> full factorial experimental design was used to investigate the main effect and the interaction between these formulation factors. The experimental condition has four independent variables (A, B, C, and D) and two dependent variables (X1 and X2) that were set to select the optimum formula by a Design-Expert software (version 8.2, Stat-Ease Inc., Minneapolis, MN). The optimized formula should have the least particle size (PS) and the highest zeta potential (ZP) as an absolute value (
