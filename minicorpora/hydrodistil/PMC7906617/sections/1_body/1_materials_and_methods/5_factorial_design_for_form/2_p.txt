0: A 2 4 full factorial experimental design was used to investigate the main effect and the interaction between these formulation factors.
1: The experimental condition has four independent variables (A, B, C, and D) and two dependent variables (X1 and X2) that were set to select the optimum formula by a Design-Expert software (version 8.2, Stat-Ease Inc., Minneapolis, MN).
2: The optimized formula should have the least particle size (PS) and the highest zeta potential (ZP) as an absolute value ( Table 2).
3: Precirol ATO-5 and stearic acid were the tested solid lipids, while Labrafac and Tween 80 were the liquid lipid and surfactant, respectively.
4: A total of 16 random runs were performed.
5: Each run was performed in triplicate.
