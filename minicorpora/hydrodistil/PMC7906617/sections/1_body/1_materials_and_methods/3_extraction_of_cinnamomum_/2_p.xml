<p>The Clevenger hydrodistillation method (Pharmac Engineers, Mumbai, India) was used to extract freshly prepared essential oil (EO) from cinnamon bark of 
 <italic>Cinnamomum zeylanicum</italic> imported from Oman. The dried bark 400 g was first grounded into powder and transferred to a round bottom flask which was connected to the condenser and then boiled with one liter of distilled water for one hour and a half. The yield EO was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and stored in a dark glass bottle at 4–8 °C to prevent oxidative degradation. The final concentration used was 2.5 mg/ml. The extracted oil was analyzed using GC/MS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Dreieich, Germany) (data not shown). The major volatile oil constituents included cinnamaldehyde, cinnamic acid, cinnamyl acetate, and eugenol.
