0: The Clevenger hydrodistillation method (Pharmac Engineers, Mumbai, India) was used to extract freshly prepared essential oil (EO) from cinnamon bark of  Cinnamomum zeylanicum imported from Oman.
1: The dried bark 400 g was first grounded into powder and transferred to a round bottom flask which was connected to the condenser and then boiled with one liter of distilled water for one hour and a half.
2: The yield EO was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and stored in a dark glass bottle at 48 C to prevent oxidative degradation.
3: The final concentration used was 2.5 mg/ml.
4: The extracted oil was analyzed using GC/MS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Dreieich, Germany) (data not shown).
5: The major volatile oil constituents included cinnamaldehyde, cinnamic acid, cinnamyl acetate, and eugenol.
