<p>A nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC) is a colloidal, nanoparticle system that composes of a mixture of solid and liquid lipids and stabilized by surfactants in an aqueous phase for drug delivery. It can entrap a large number of lipophilic agents due to the imperfect matrix arisen from the mixed lipid components which prevent homogeneous crystal formation (Beloqui et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). NLCs are highly biodegradable and biocompatible and provide better drug delivery and skin permeation compared to solid lipid nanoparticles (Garcês et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). NLCs have been demonstrated in delivering highly lipophilic drugs into targeted organs, and damaged tissues such as burn wounds (Zahir-Jouzdani et al.,
