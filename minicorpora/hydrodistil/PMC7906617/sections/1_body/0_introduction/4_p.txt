0: A nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC) is a colloidal, nanoparticle system that composes of a mixture of solid and liquid lipids and stabilized by surfactants in an aqueous phase for drug delivery.
1: It can entrap a large number of lipophilic agents due to the imperfect matrix arisen from the mixed lipid components which prevent homogeneous crystal formation (Beloqui et al.,  2016).
2: NLCs are highly biodegradable and biocompatible and provide better drug delivery and skin permeation compared to solid lipid nanoparticles (Garces et al.,  2018).
3: NLCs have been demonstrated in delivering highly lipophilic drugs into targeted organs, and damaged tissues such as burn wounds (Zahir-Jouzdani et al.,  2019).
4: This study aims to investigate nanotechnology-based topical NLC-Cinnamon oil gel as a novel application for  P. aeruginosa wound infection with better antibacterial efficacy  in vivo.
