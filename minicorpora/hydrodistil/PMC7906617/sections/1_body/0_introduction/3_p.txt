0: There is a growing interest in the clinical use of natural products against antibiotic-resistant pathogens such as  Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a biofilm-forming bacterium due to overuse of antibiotics.
1: In this concern, more attention was given to include natural products in wound management seeking reduction of side effects encountered from too much consumption of chemicals, especially that the infected patients already had a special skin situation.
2: One of these trending phyto-compounds is cinnamon bark oil which has been used in antimicrobial, antidiabetic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory applications with substantial beneficial evidence since ancient times.
3: The active constituents of cinnamon oil are cinnamaldehyde (6580%) and eugenol (510%) that have proven inhibition ability against  P. aeruginosa to form antibiotic-resistant biofilms (Utchariyakiat et al.,  2016).
4: Another important feature of cinnamon oil is its ability to advance tissue regeneration and accelerate wound healing which will help wound patients in recovering their skin integrity (Seyed Ahmadi et al.,  2019).
5: However, low solubility and instability are the major limitation factors to achieve sustained delivery of this phyto-compound for clinical use (Bilia et al.,  2014).
6: There were only a few published topical preparations aiming to deliver cinnamon oil in nanocarriers such as nano cream (Zainol et al.,  2015) and nanoemulsion (Mukerjee et al.,  2019) and yet none addressed wound infection.
7: Thus, it is essential to design a cinnamon oil delivery system to overcome these challenges to maximize its therapeutic efficiency.
