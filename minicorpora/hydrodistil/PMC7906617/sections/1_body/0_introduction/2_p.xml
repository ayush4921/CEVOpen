<p>Wound infection is the main risk factor in patients with burns, and burn wound caused by 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> is one of the most challenged wound care management in the hospitals (Jault et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Difficulties in management may arise from the severe inflammation of the tissues and untreated infections as well as the biofilms that might be formed as a result of microbial infection introducing more resistance to cure. Without proper treatment, an acute wound could develop into a chronic wound due to the presence of more virulent bacterial species which increases the mobility and economic burden of patients (Rahim et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Therefore, infection research is given as the top priority by the British Burns Association (BBA) for the patient benefit (The British Burns Association Research Special Interest Group, 
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>).
