0: Wound infection is the main risk factor in patients with burns, and burn wound caused by  Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most challenged wound care management in the hospitals (Jault et al.,  2018).
1: Difficulties in management may arise from the severe inflammation of the tissues and untreated infections as well as the biofilms that might be formed as a result of microbial infection introducing more resistance to cure.
2: Without proper treatment, an acute wound could develop into a chronic wound due to the presence of more virulent bacterial species which increases the mobility and economic burden of patients (Rahim et al.,  2017).
3: Therefore, infection research is given as the top priority by the British Burns Association (BBA) for the patient benefit (The British Burns Association Research Special Interest Group,  2018).
