<p>FTIR analysis based on molecular vibrations of band spectra is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4</xref>. The purity of the cinnamon oil from the prepared extract was confirmed with the theoretical frequency of the band (Boughendjioua et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) which showed the characteristic absorption peaks of the functional groups in chemical composition with aldehyde C=O stretching at 1743 and 1681 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and the strongest IR absorptions of carbonyl stretching at 1626 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. These peaks corresponded to high levels of cinnamaldehyde and aldehydes of the sample. There was also the presence of unsaturated C=C stretching at 1576 and 1451 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and the aromatic =C–H stretching peak at 3008 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> which was slightly higher than the –C–H stretching in alkanes at 2926 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. Compared with pure cinnamon oil, the disappearance of these characteristic absorptions in the bands of spectrum of NLC-cinnamon oil indicated that cinnamon oil is well entrapped inside the nanocarriers. Also, the characteristic C–H asymmetric stretching peak of stearic acid at 2914 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and C–H symmetric stretching at absorbance peak at 2840 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (Amanda Velinna Fernandes et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) became much weaker in the absorption bands of NLC-cinnamon oil, indicating that stearic acid was well incorporated into nanoparticles. The broad O–H band around 3364–3229 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> in NLC-cinnamon oil became shorter because the formulation was stabilized by Tween 80. The nanoformulation also showed hydrogen bond in hydrocarbon chain with bands at 2964 and 2844 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and carbonyl group at 1733 and 1675 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. C=C stretch was also observed at 1541 and 1471 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. Overall, the IR chart indicated a good formation of NLC nanoformulation which efficiently entrapped cinnamon oil with no excipient interaction.
