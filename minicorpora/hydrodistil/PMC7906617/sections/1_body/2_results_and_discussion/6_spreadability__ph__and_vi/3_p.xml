<p>The prepared NLC-cinnamon oil gel is a soft gel with milky color and pH 6.30 ± 1.02 which is suitable for topical application. 
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> shows the comparison of spreadability and viscosity of the selected formulation and the control gels which exhibits a negative relation between the spreadability and viscosity. The lipid contents in the NLC increased the gel’s apparent viscosity. The viscosity of NLC-cinnamon oil gel was increased to 977.26 ± 22.6 cP which is about double the viscosity of the pure Poloxamer 407gel of 445.38 ± 28.89 cP.
