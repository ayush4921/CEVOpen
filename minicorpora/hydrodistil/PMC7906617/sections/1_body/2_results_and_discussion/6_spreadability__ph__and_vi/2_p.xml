<p>Poloxamer 407 is a hydrophilic, nonionic copolymer with a center block of hydrophobic polypropylene oxide (PPO) and two hydrophilic polyethylene oxide (PEO) blocks on both sides. This thermosensitive hydrogel has bioadhesive properties and many applications in drug delivery showing the controllable sustained release of the drug from the formulation, such as parenteral, ophthalmic, nasal, vaginal, rectal, and topical applications (Fakhari etÂ al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). In preparation, Poloxamer 407 aqueous dispersion remains liquid under Tsol-gel due to self-assemble into micelles. Upon increasing the temperature, the polymer starts the gelling process due to the dehydration of the hydrophobic PPO blocks (Denisa Ficai,
