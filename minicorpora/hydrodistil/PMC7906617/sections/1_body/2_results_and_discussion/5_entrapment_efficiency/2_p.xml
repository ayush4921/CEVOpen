<p>Entrapment efficiency is one of the important parameters in developing nanoparticle delivery systems. High EE% indicates that the drug is successfully entrapped into the nanoparticle (Zhang et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Cinnamon oil was very well entrapped in the nanoparticles with a high EE% of 95.39 ± 0.82% which confirmed the suitability and effectiveness of formulation design using NLC as nanocarriers for cinnamon oil.
