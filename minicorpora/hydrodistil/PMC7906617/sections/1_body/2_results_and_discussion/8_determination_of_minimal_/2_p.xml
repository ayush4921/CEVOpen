<p>Cinnamon bark oil has a wide variety of antimicrobial activities due to the presence of chemical compounds as cinnamaldehyde (the main constituent), eugenol, coumarin, and O-methoxycinnamaldehyde (Utchariyakiat et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The antimicrobial effect of the cinnamon oil exerts probably through the action of these compounds. The concentration tested in this study were 0.0039%, 0.0078%, 0.0156%, 0.03125%, 0.0625%, 0.125%, 0.25%, and 0.5% w/v. 
 <xref rid="t0007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref> shows that NLC-cinnamon oil gel exhibits significant inhibitory activity against the test strain 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> compared to all other formulations, with the lowest MIC of 312.50 μg/ml (ANOVA, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). NLC-cinnamon oil colloid also showed a stronger anti-microbial effect than the cinnamon oil alone which was in agreement with the finding by Kim et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) that showed marked inhibition of biofilm formation, swarming motility, and the hemolytic activity of 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> by cinnamon bark oil. The enhanced anti-microbial activity in NLC-cinnamon oil gel may also contribute to nanoparticles with large surface area and the lipophilic nature of the NLCs which enable better bacterial cell penetration and uptake (Osman et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Both NLC-cinnamon colloid and NLC-cinnamon gel showed statistically significant MIC again 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> compared to the cinnamon oil group (post hoc Bonferroni’s test, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). The excipients of plain gel and NLC blank gel had no inhibitory effect against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> with the tested concentrations. The percentages decrease in MIC from NLC-cinnamon colloid and NLC-cinnamon gel compared to pure cinnamon oil was 75% and 87.5%, respectively.
