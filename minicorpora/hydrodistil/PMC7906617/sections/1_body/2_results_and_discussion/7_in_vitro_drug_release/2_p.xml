<p>The percent cumulative cinnamon oil released from both NLC gel and colloidal systems were compared to the gel containing only the pure cinnamon oil. The drug release profile exhibited an initial burst release in all tested formulations in the first five hours, followed by a slow, sustained release up to five days; however, the NLC-cinnamon oil gel has less burst release effect compared to the NLC-cinnamon oil colloid and cinnamon oil gel, indicating gel containing NLC effectively entrapped cinnamon oil and controlled its release from the formulation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5</xref>). Herein, more control of the drug release was observed in the case of NLC-cinnamon oil gel in which the release pattern of cinnamon oil has achieved sustained manner. This result strongly confirmed an additive contributing effect of both NLC nanoparticles and gel base as barriers to the release of entrapped cinnamon oil. The difference calculated for NLC-cinnamon gel and cinnamon oil gel was found to be 45.84, indicating that the curves were not similar. Moreover, one-way ANOVA showed significant difference between the releases of cinnamon oil from these tested formulations. Further, post hoc Tukey’s multiple comparison tests found significant differences in drug release between the NLC-cinnamon oil gel and NLC-cinnamon colloid, and NLC-cinnamon oil gel and cinnamon oil gel (

 <italic>p</italic>&gt;.05) which further implied the synergistic effect in retarding the drug release.
