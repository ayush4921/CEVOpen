<p>By the 5th day, 51.6% of cinnamon oil was released from the NLC gel compared to 63.1% from the NLC colloid and 63.7% from the gel. To further explain this result, based on Fick’s law of diffusion and the Noyes–Whitney equation theories, experimental data were appropriately fitted into the Nernst–Brunner equation d

 <italic>t</italic> = 
 <italic>DS</italic> (
 <italic>Cs</italic> – 
 <italic>C</italic>)/
 <italic>Vh</italic>, where, drug dissolution rate (d
 <italic>C</italic>/d
 <italic>t</italic>) is inversely proportional to path length (
 <italic>h</italic>). Herein, an increase in path length traversed by cinnamon oil through both NLC and gel until reaching the dissolution media will in turn decrease its release rate (Vasanth et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Furthermore, we investigated the release mechanism of cinnamon oil from different formulations using various mathematical models, including zero-order, first-order, Higuchi, and Korsmeyer–Peppas models. The model with the highest coefficient of determination (

 <sup>2</sup>) was considered to be the best fitting one. Cinnamon oil released from all test samples was found to follow the Korsmeyer–Peppas model (

 <sup>2</sup> value of 0.976, and
