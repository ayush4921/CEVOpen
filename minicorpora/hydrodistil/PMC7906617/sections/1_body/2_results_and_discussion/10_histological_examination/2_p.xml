 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0009">Figure 9</xref> shows that the skin specimen from the normal control group presented typical cellular integrity with an intact surface epithelium, normal dermis, and subcutaneous tissue lacking any inflammatory infiltrate. The skin specimens from group 1 (without any treatment) showed a third-degree burn with wide ulceration of the surface epithelium covered by fibroid inflammatory exudate. The dermis part contained an inflammatory infiltrate formed of mixed acute and chronic inflammatory cells of neutrophils, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and histiocytes. The second group treated with cinnamon oil gel showed a smaller skin ulcer, compared to the first group, covered by fibrinoid material. The dermis and subcutaneous tissue showed mixed acute and chronic inflammatory cells. Group 3 (NLC-cinnamon colloid) showed a wide area of granulation tissue and fibrosis denoting the healing process with minor inflammatory infiltrate. The fourth group (NLC blank gel) showed skin ulceration covered by the fibrinoid material. Area of granulation tissue and fibrosis appeared in the dermis and subcutaneous tissue; however, less than group 3, while the inflammatory infiltrates were more than that of group 3. The fifth group (NLC-cinnamon gel) showed the most remarkable amount of fibrosis of the dermis and subcutaneous tissue with only a few inflammatory cells toward completion of healing.
