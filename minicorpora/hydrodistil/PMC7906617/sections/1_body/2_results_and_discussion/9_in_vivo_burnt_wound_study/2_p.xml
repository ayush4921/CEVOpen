<p>Visual assessment of the wound surface and edge contraction daily (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6</xref>) showed that group 3 has similar healing progress as group 5 in the appearance of skin structure regrowth; however, group 5 presented more completed induration of firmly new skin growth and smooth wound edge with no signs of infection. The infected wound in group 1 (no treatment) appeared persistent erythematous infectious lesion during the treatment period with no improvement. Skin lesion in group 2, on the other hand, showed edematous and scarred surface with diffused wound edge which may be due to the irritation effect of the diluted cinnamon oil in the carrier oil directly applied on the open wound.
