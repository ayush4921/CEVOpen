<p>The effectiveness of the tested formulation was additionally compared with control and excipient formulations by measuring the burn area contraction of the wound healing mechanism in rats (Abdullahi et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0008">Figure 8</xref> shows that the burn contraction area was the smallest in group 5. Importantly, ANOVA (GraphPad Prism 8, La Jolla, CA) showed a significant difference between all groups (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001). Further post hoc with Bonferroni’s pairwise comparisons indicated a significant reduction of burn contraction area between the control (group 1) and tested formulation (group 5) (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), achieving the antibacterial outcome and accelerated wound healing. The rate of reduction in burn wound area was also highest in group 5 with 1.787 cm
 <sup>2</sup>/d and in the descending order of group 5 (1.787 cm
 <sup>2</sup>/d), group 3 (1.665 cm
 <sup>2</sup>/d), group 2 (1.2962 cm
 <sup>2</sup>/d), group 4 (0.8572 cm
 <sup>2</sup>/d), and group 1 (0.4548 cm
 <sup>2</sup>/d). Overall, NLC-cinnamon oil gel achieved significant completed wound healing on the burn wound infected by
