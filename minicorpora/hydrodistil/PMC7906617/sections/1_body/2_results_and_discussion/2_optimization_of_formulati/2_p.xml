<p>The formed NLC-cinnamon oil formulations were mostly white opaque colloids with various viscosities depending on the studied factors. Preliminary experimental trials were performed (data not shown) at first to select the factors as well as their levels. Full factorial design and statistical analysis were obtained using Design-Expert
 <sup>®</sup> software. The predicted

 <sup>2</sup> of 0.6998 for PS and 0.6746 for ZP, respectively. This means both

The optimized formulation generated by the program with desirability 0.892 showed the following responses: 108.48 ± 6.35 nm of PS, −37.36 ± 4.01 mV of ZP, solid:liquid lipid ratio of 4.5:1, total lipid concentration of 15.25% w/v, Tween 80 of 2.5% w/v, and stearic acid as solid lipid.
