<p>Optimizing the PS of the topically applied NLC is one of the important factors to be considered during formulation development. A nano-sized system can increase the probability of better and deeper drug penetration into skin strata (Abd-Elsalam et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). The effect of the formulation variables studied in the current research, including the type of solid lipid (A), solid:liquid lipid ratio (B), total lipid content (C), and surfactant concentration (D) on the mean NLC PS are illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>. Stearic acid generated NLC with smaller PS than Precirol. The ANOVA data obtained from Design-Expert
 <sup>®</sup> software for NLC PS statistical analysis showed that type of solid lipid (A) had a significant effect on the mean PS with stearic acid better than Precirol
 <sup>®</sup> in decreasing the PS (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Compared to Precirol
 <sup>®</sup>, stearic acid has a much shorter carbon chain length which may permit the accommodation of a greater amount of active ingredient due to more space availability as suggested by Mahant et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). On the other hand, solid:liquid lipid ratios also showed a significant effect on NLC mean PS (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), where the smallest PS was found in the 1:1 ratio. This result was in agreement with a study reported by Sathe et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) where the PS of NLC prepared using solid lipid (Precirol
 <sup>®</sup> ATO 5) and liquid lipid Labrafac
 <sup>TM</sup> PG had decreased from 321.06 ± 7.73 nm to 280 ± 15.583 nm when they used ratios of 2:1 and 1:1, respectively. Furthermore, a significant effect of total lipid concentration on NLC PS was also found (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). PS decreased upon increasing the total lipid concentration from 10 to 20%. Higher lipid amount leads to the higher viscosity of NLC surface in which Labrafac
 <sup>TM</sup> may tend to cause immense disorder in the crystal lattice due to its high HLB of 10, resulting in spontaneous emulsification in the presence of surfactant and yielding smaller PS. Our results came in agreement with those found by Gaba et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), where the PS decreased when they increased the concentration of total lipid in their NLC system. One has to consider the interactions between all factors and the materials used in the formulation. The PS of the formed NLC in this study decreased when surfactants concentration increased from 0.5 to 3%. It is also reported that NLC of lower PS can be obtained using high surfactant concentration (Pardeike et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Higher surfactant concentration means reduced surface tension and consequently smaller size particles can be formed (Uprit et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Overall, total lipid and surfactant concentrations had more profound effects on the PS reduction.
