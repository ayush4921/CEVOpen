 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2</xref> shows the effect of factors; A: type of solid lipid, B: solid:liquid lipid ratio, C: total lipid content, and D: SAA concentration on mean ZP (mV). The model generated for the ZP graphs had a 
 <italic>p</italic> value of  &lt; .0001 and an 
 <italic>F</italic>-value of 7.43 which implied the significance of the model. The predicted 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> of 0.4882 is in reasonable agreement with the adjusted 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> of 0.6746. The ZPs of all the prepared NLCs were negative and ranged from −11.30 ± 3.99 to −43.10 ± 7.06 mV. The negative charge is attributed to the presence of either stearic acid or Precirol. Most of the NLCs had ZP values high enough to ensure physical stability due to both electrostatic repulsions and steric hindrance in the presence of long chains in the SAA structure (Vasanth et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Besides, the PDI of these formulations ranged from 0.181 to 0.548 indicating homogeneity of nanoparticle size distribution.
