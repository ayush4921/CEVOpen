<p>Treatment for infected wounds should not only inhibit the causing microorganism but also promote the wound healing repairing process. The infected wound in experimental rats revealed that NLC-cinnamon oil gel significantly improved wound contraction percentage compared to the untreated and cinnamon oil groups by accelerated wound healing and antimicrobial effect. Our findings suggest that topical administration of NLC-cinnamon oil gel resulted in a significant antimicrobial activity and promotion of wound healing and skin regeneration. The studied nanoparticle-based cinnamon oil gel is a promising natural product against antibiotic-resistant strains of
