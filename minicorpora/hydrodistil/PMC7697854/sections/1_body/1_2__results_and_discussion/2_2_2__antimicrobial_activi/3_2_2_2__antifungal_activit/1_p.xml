<p>We evaluated the antifungal activities of SEO and monomers by using 
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>. 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05244-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05244-t0A3" ref-type="table">Table A3</xref> summarized MIC and MBC of SEO and monomers. The MIC of SEO results implied that SEO had the highest antifungal activities against 
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> at 3.2 mg/mL. The antifungal activities of the major monomers of SEO, namely α-pinene, α-terpineol, verbenone and terpinolene, were tested separately. The results showed that α-pinene had the highest antifungal activity against 
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (MIC = 0.8 mg/mL and MBC = 1.6 mg/mL) out of the SEO monomers. In addition, the α-pinene content of SEO was 26.00%. Previous studies also found that α-pinene had a great antifungal effect [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-25-05244" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The other three main monomers, namely verbenone, terpinolene and α-terpineol, had strong antifungal activities, showing that α-pinene, α-terpineol, terpinolene and verbenone play primary roles in the antifungal activities of SEO against 
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>.
