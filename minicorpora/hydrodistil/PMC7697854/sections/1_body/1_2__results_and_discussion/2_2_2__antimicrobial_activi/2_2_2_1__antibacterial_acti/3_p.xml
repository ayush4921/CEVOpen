<p>Essential oils from other plants, such as essential oil of 
 <italic>Mentha citrata</italic> Ehrh., 
 <italic>Artemisia annua</italic> L. and 
 <italic>Citrus medica</italic> L., were found to have antibacterial activities. Essential oil of 
 <italic>Mentha citrata</italic> Ehrh. had significant antibacterial activity at 0.5 mg/mL against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-25-05244" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The MIC of the essential oil from 
 <italic>Artemisia annua</italic> L. against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> was 10 mg/mL [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-25-05244" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The essential oil from fruits of 
 <italic>Citrus medica</italic> L. had the MIC of 1.56 mg/mL against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-25-05244" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In this work, SEO was found to have antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MIC = 0.2 mg/mL). The smaller MIC value indicates the better antibacterial activity of essential oil. The results showed that SEO had better antibacterial activities than essential oils of other plants, such as 
 <italic>Mentha citrata</italic> Ehrh., 
 <italic>Artemisia annua</italic> L. and 
 <italic>Citrus medica</italic> L.
