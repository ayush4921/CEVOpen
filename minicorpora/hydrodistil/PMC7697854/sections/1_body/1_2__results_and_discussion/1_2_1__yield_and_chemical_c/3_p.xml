However, the most of chemical components of essential oil from different sunflower parts (receptacle, capitula and pollen) were different. For example, kaur-16-ene, 16-kaur-16-ol and kauran-16-ol were unique chemical components of the sunflower receptacle. A previous study showed that kaur-16-ene strongly inhibited cancer cells [
