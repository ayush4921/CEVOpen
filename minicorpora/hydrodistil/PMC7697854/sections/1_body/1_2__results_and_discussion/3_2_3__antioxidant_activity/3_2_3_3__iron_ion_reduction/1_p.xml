<p>Iron ion reduction ability and the concentration of SEO showed an approximately linear relationship when the concentration of SEO was increased from 0.1 to 8 mg/mL (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05244-f003">Figure 3</xref>). The reducing power is related to the absorbance and increases with increasing absorbance. The results show that the iron ion reduction ability of SEO was related to the SEO concentration. The higher concentrations had better reducing abilities. When the concentration of SEO reached 8 mg/mL, the reduction ability was the greatest.
