<p>In the early stage, ABTS scavenging rate increased with the increasing concentration of SEO (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05244-f001">Figure 1</xref>). When the concentrations of SEO were 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0 mg/mL, the ABTS scavenging rates were 37%, 54%, 75%, 84%, 90% and 96%, respectively. The results of ABTS free radical scavenging showed that the free radical scavenging rate of SEO reached 96% when the concentration of SEO was 1.0 mg/mL, which implied that SEO had great free radical scavenging antioxidant activity.
