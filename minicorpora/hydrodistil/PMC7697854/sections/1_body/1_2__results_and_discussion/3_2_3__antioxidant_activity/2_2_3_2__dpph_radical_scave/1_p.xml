<p>DPPH, as a stable free radical, has been widely used as a tool to evaluate free radical scavenging antioxidant activities. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05244-f002">Figure 2</xref>, the DPPH free radical scavenging rate depended on the concentration of SEO. DPPH free radical scavenging rates were 15.90%, 22.40%, 39.01%, 65.94%, 75.25%, 92.57% and 100%, when the concentrations of SEO were 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9 and 10 mg/mL, respectively. It is significant that the DPPH free radical scavenging ability of SEO reached 100% when the concentration of SEO was 10 mg/mL, which is the same rate as that of the positive control trolox. The DPPH free radical scavenging activity results showed that SEO had good antioxidant activity. The antioxidant properties of terpenes and their derivatives were similar to those of phenolic compounds, which can scavenge free radicals by supplying hydrogen to hydrogen atoms [
