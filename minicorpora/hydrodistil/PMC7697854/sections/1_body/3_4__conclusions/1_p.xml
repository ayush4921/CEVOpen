<p>The work presented in this paper represents the first study on the chemical components and biological activities of SEO. The yield of SEO was 0.42% (

 <italic>w</italic>) by hydrodistillation. SEO contained 68 chemical compounds, as determined by GC-MS analysis. The main components were terpenoids, including α-pinene and verbenone. Through in vitro antimicrobial experiments, SEO and the monomers (α-pinene, α-terpineol, terpinolene and verbenone) were shown to have great antimicrobial effects. The antioxidative abilities (ABTS, DPPH and iron ion reduction ability) were determined in vitro, proving that SEO has strong antioxidant effects. Therefore, SEO is worthy of further exploration due to its antibacterial and antioxidant potential.
