<p>Retention indices of the separated compounds on the HP-INNOWax capillary column were determined on the basis of a homologous series of n-alkanes (C9–C30). The compounds of essential oil were identified on the basis of comparison of their retention indices and mass spectra with published data and computer matching with National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, 15.0) libraries provided with a computer controlling the GC-MS system. The relative proportions of SEO constituents were expressed as percentages obtained by peak area normalization, and all relative response factors were set as 1. Pentadecane was used as internal standard and α-pinene, verbenone, terpinolene and α-terpineol were used as external standards for GC-MS analysis.</p>
