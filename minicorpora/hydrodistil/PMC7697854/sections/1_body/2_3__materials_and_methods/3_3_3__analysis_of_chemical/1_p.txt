0: The sample of SEO (10 L) was diluted in n-hexane (10 L) and analyzed with the Agilent 5975 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA).
1: The separation was achieved using an HP-INNOWax capillary column (30 m  0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 m film thickness) (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA).
2: Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 mL/min.
3: Injector and detector temperatures were set at 250 and 280 C, respectively.
4: The oven was maintained at 60 C for 3 min and then programmed to rise to 240 C at 5 C/min and held for 15 min at 240 C. Electronic ion (EI) mode was set as 70 eV, mass spectra were recorded in the 50550 amu range and the ion source temperature was 230 C.
