<p>The sample of SEO (10 μL) was diluted in n-hexane (10 μL) and analyzed with the Agilent 5975 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The separation was achieved using an HP-INNOWax capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 µm film thickness) (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Injector and detector temperatures were set at 250 and 280 °C, respectively. The oven was maintained at 60 °C for 3 min and then programmed to rise to 240 °C at 5 °C/min and held for 15 min at 240 °C. Electronic ion (EI) mode was set as 70 eV, mass spectra were recorded in the 50–550 amu range and the ion source temperature was 230 °C.</p>
