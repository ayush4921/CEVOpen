<p>DPPH radical scavenging activity was determined according to the modified protocol from Das [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-25-05244" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Ethanol and DPPH were mixed to prepare 0.08 mmol/L DPPH solution, which was stored in the dark. Here, 1 mL sample and 3 mL DPPH solution were mixed and kept at room temperature for 30 min in the dark. The absorption value was measured at 517 nm. Anhydrous ethanol and Trolox were the negative and positive controls, respectively.
