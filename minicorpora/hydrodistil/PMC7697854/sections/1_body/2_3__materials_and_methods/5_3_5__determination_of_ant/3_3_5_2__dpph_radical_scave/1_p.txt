0: DPPH radical scavenging activity was determined according to the modified protocol from Das [ 29].
1: Ethanol and DPPH were mixed to prepare 0.08 mmol/L DPPH solution, which was stored in the dark.
2: Here, 1 mL sample and 3 mL DPPH solution were mixed and kept at room temperature for 30 min in the dark.
3: The absorption value was measured at 517 nm.
4: Anhydrous ethanol and Trolox were the negative and positive controls, respectively.
