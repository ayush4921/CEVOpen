<p>The iron ion reducing ability was determined using Congyi Biology kit (Shanghai, China), according to the method of Prussian blue [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-25-05244" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The antioxidant activity can change the ferric iron of potassium ferricyanide to ferrous ions. Which formed to Prussian blue.The material had a maximum absorption peak at 700 nm. A larger absorption value means a better antioxidant capacity of the sample.
