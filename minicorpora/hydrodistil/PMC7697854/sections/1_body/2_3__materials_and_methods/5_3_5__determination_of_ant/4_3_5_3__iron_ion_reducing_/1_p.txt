0: The iron ion reducing ability was determined using Congyi Biology kit (Shanghai, China), according to the method of Prussian blue [ 30].
1: The antioxidant activity can change the ferric iron of potassium ferricyanide to ferrous ions.
2: Which formed to Prussian blue.The material had a maximum absorption peak at 700 nm.
3: A larger absorption value means a better antioxidant capacity of the sample.
