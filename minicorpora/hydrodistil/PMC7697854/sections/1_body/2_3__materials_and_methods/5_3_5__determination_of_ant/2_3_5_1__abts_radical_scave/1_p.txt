0: ABTS radical scavenging activity was determined by the modified protocol from Kang [ 28].
1: The ABTS working solution was mixed with 2.6 mmol K 2S 2O 8 and 7.4 mmol ABTS, which was incubated for 12 h at room temperature in the dark and diluted 4045 times with ethanol.
2: We added 0.5 mL sample to 2 mL ABTS working solution and incubated for 6 min at room temperature in the dark.
3: The absorbance was measured at 734 nm.
4: Trolox was used as a positive control.
