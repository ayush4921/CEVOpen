<p>ABTS radical scavenging activity was determined by the modified protocol from Kang [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-25-05244" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The ABTS working solution was mixed with 2.6 mmol K
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>8</sub> and 7.4 mmol ABTS, which was incubated for 12 h at room temperature in the dark and diluted 40â€“45 times with ethanol. We added 0.5 mL sample to 2 mL ABTS working solution and incubated for 6 min at room temperature in the dark. The absorbance was measured at 734 nm. Trolox was used as a positive control.
