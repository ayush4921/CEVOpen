0: The MIC and MBC were measured by using a microplate reader (EL800, BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA) [ 15].
1: Each monomer of essential oil (-pinene, -terpineol, terpinolene and verbenone) in the culture medium had nine different concentrations, namely 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, 3.2, 6.4 and 12.8 mg/mL.
2: Monomer mixture (with -pinene, -terpineol, terpinolene and verbenone) and SEO in the culture medium had nine different concentrations, namely 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, 3.2, 6.4 and 12.8 mg/mL.
3: A 200 L mixed sample was added to each well of a 96-well microplate.
4: The 200 L mixed sample was mixed with 179 L culture medium, 20 L sample and 1 L 2.0  10 6 CFU/mL bacteria or 2.0  10 5 CFU/mL fungi.
5: The bacteria were cultured at 3537 C for 24 h, and the fungi were cultured at 2526 C for 48 h. The absorbance was measured by using the microplate reader at 600 nm.
6: Tetracycline hydrochloride was used as positive control for the antibacterial experiments.
7: Miconazole nitrate was used as positive control for the antifungal experiments.
8: Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 5% ( w/v) and DMSO at 1% ( w/v) were used as negative controls of antibacterial and antifungal experiments, respectively.
9: The experiments were carried out in triplicate.
