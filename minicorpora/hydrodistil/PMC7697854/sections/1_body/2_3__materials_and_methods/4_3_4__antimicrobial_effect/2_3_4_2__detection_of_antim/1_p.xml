<p>The MIC and MBC were measured by using a microplate reader (EL×800, BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA) [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-25-05244" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Each monomer of essential oil (α-pinene, α-terpineol, terpinolene and verbenone) in the culture medium had nine different concentrations, namely 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, 3.2, 6.4 and 12.8 mg/mL. Monomer mixture (with α-pinene, α-terpineol, terpinolene and verbenone) and SEO in the culture medium had nine different concentrations, namely 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, 3.2, 6.4 and 12.8 mg/mL. A 200 μL mixed sample was added to each well of a 96-well microplate. The 200 μL mixed sample was mixed with 179 μL culture medium, 20 μL sample and 1 μL 2.0 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU/mL bacteria or 2.0 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> CFU/mL fungi. The bacteria were cultured at 35–37 °C for 24 h, and the fungi were cultured at 25–26 °C for 48 h. The absorbance was measured by using the microplate reader at 600 nm. Tetracycline hydrochloride was used as positive control for the antibacterial experiments. Miconazole nitrate was used as positive control for the antifungal experiments. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 5% (
 <italic>w/v</italic>) and DMSO at 1% (
 <italic>w/v</italic>) were used as negative controls of antibacterial and antifungal experiments, respectively. The experiments were carried out in triplicate.
