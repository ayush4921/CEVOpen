    "Sunflower (<i>Helianthus annuus</i> L.) contains active ingredients, such as flavonoids, alkaloids and tannins. Nevertheless, few studies have focused on essential oil from the receptacle of sunflower (SEO). In this work, we investigated the chemical composition and antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of SEO. The yield of SEO was about 0.42% (<i>v</i>/<i>w</i>) by hydrodistillation. A total of 68 volatile components of SEO were putatively identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The main constituents of SEO were α-pinene (26.00%), verbenone (7.40%), terpinolene (1.69%) and α-terpineol (1.27%). The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of SEO against <i>P. aeruginosa</i> and <i>S. aureus</i> was 0.2 mg/mL. The MIC of SEO against <i>S. cerevisiae</i> was 3.2 mg/mL. The MIC of SEO against <i>E. coli</i> and <i>Candida albicans</i> was 6.4 mg/mL. The results showed that SEO had high antibacterial and antifungal activities. Three different analytical assays (DPPH, ABTS and iron ion reducing ability) were used to determine the antioxidant activities. The results showed that SEO had antioxidant activities. To summarize, the results in this study demonstrate the possibility for the development and application of SEO in potential natural preservatives and medicines due to its excellent antimicrobial and antioxidant activities."
