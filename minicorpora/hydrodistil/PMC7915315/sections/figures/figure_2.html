 <caption> The mean diameter of brain tissue cysts in mice of tested group. The mean diameter of tissue cysts in experimental group C2 was 57.4 ± 3.35 µm, although this value was 43.5 ± 2.96 µm in mice of experimental group Ex1 (100 mg/kg); however, the mean diameter of tissue cyst was significantly reduced in mice of experimental groups Ex2 (200 mg/kg) and Ex3 (300 mg/kg). ** p &lt; 0.001. </caption>
