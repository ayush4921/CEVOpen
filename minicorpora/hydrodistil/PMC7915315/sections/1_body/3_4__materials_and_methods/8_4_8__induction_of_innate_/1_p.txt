0: The mRNA levels of IFN-, and IL12 which are considered as key factors related to toxoplasmosis control mechanisms were measured in all tested mice using quantitative real time PCR.
1: The total brain RNA was extracted by means of the RNA-easy kits (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany); whereas all isolated RNAs were reverse-transcribed according to the manufactures protocols.
2: Consequently, the collected complementary DNA (cDNA) was applied to conventional PCR amplification or real-time PCR.
3: To perform the Real-time PCR we used the iQ5 real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).
4: All amplification products were determined by SYBR green [ 40].
5: The reaction conditions of real-time PCR were included initial denaturation at 95 C for 10 min, 40 amplification cycles [denaturation at 95 C for 10 s, annealing at 56 C for 30 s, and elongation at 72 C for 30 s], followed by one cycle at 72 C for 5 min.
6: The iQ TM5 optical system software (Bio-Rad) was used for data analysis.
7: Here, -actin which is well-known as a housekeeping gene was considered as a normalization control.
8: Oligonucleotide primers used for real-time RT-PCR analysis are shown in  Table 1.
