0: Figure 4 shows the experimental design of the present study.
1: Male BALB/c mice were divided into two main groups (control (C) and experimental group (Ex)) with six sub-groups including C1 (non-treated non infected), C2 (treated with olive oil as solvent), C3 (Infected mice treated with Atovaquone 100 mg/kg/day), Ex1 (MCEO 100 mg/kg/day), Ex2 (MCEO 200 mg/kg/day), and Ex3 (MCEO 300 mg/kg/day).
2: After 3 weeks of treatment, the mice in all groups, except the C 1 group, were infected with the Tehran strain of  T. gondii.
3: It should also be mentioned that the selection of doses of MCEO was based on the previous study conducted by the present authors which revealed that MCEO in these doses has no toxicity in mice [ 28].
