<p>Previously studied species of

 <italic>M. didyma</italic> grown in Canada had thymol, γ-terpinene, carvacrol, and β-myrcene as the main constituents, while Canadian 
 <italic>M. fistulosa</italic> essential oil contained geraniol, geranial, geranyl formate, and 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene [

 <italic>M. fistulosa</italic> cultivated in Italy was characterized by a high content of thymol (28–33%). Essential oils of 
 <italic>M. fistulosa</italic> from the Krasnodar region of Russia contained 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (32.5%), carvacrol (24.0%), thymol (12.6%), and the methyl ether of carvacrol (5.5%) [
