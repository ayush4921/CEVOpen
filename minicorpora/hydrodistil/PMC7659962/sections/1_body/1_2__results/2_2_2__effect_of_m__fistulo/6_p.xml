<p>Although we did not evaluate the cytotoxicity of the

Furthermore, the essential oils, as well as their constituent monoterpenes (see below), had no effect on the nontransfected/parental HEK 293 cell viability. Indeed, receptor-effector coupling of these cells after essential oil treatment was robust upon treatment with ATP, which induced a pronounced increase in [Ca
