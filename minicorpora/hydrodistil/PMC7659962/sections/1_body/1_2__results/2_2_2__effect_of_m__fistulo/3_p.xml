<p>To investigate whether 
 <italic>Monarda</italic> essential oils activated members of the vanilloid group of TRP channels (V1 and V4), we performed real-time calcium imaging in HEK 293 cells stably overexpressing either hTRPV1 or hTRPV4 channels. Representative traces show that 20 Âµg/mL of MEO
 <sub>Fl</sub> and MEO
 <sub>Lv</sub> failed to induce any increase in [Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>]
 <sub>i</sub> in HEK hTRPV1 and HEK hTRPV4 cells (
