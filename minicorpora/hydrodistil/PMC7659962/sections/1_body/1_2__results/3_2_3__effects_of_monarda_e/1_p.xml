<p>Since 
 <italic>Monarda</italic> essential oils activated TRPA1 channels, we next investigated the TRPA1-activating effects of their constituent monoterpenes to identify the active compounds. Sixteen commercially available compounds, including six major compounds (carvacrol, thymol, β-myrcene, α-terpinene, γ-terpinene, and 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene), were evaluated for agonist effects on [Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>]
 <sub>i</sub> in HEK rTRPA1 cells; however, only carvacrol, thymol, and β-myrcene exhibited significant agonist activity (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04873-f005">Figure 5</xref>, increasing concentrations of carvacrol (

 <sub>i</sub> via the activation of TRPA1 channels. Thus, these three compounds, representing 50.2% of MEO
 <sub>Fl</sub> and 75.6% of MEO

 <sub>i</sub> induced by these monoterpenes in HEK rTRPA1 cells are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04873-f005">Figure 5</xref>D. In contrast, α-terpinene, γ-terpinene, 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene, and ten minor constituents of the 
 <italic>Monarda</italic> essential oils did not elicit significant changes in [Ca
