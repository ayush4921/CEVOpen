<p>The major monoterpenes present in 
 <italic>M. fistulosa</italic> essential oils, including carvacrol, β-myrcene, α-terpinene, γ-terpinene, and thymol, had no effect on either the hTRPV1 or hTRPV4 channels. Carvacrol has been implicated in a myriad of biological activities, including antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory activities [
