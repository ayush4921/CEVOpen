0: Members of the calcium-permeable transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channel family respond to a wide variety of odorant phytochemicals.
1: For example, TRPA1 is activated by mustard oil or allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) from the mustard plant [ 30], TRPM8 is activated by menthol from mint [ 31, 32], and TRPV1 is activated by capsaicin from chili peppers [ 33].
2: Essential oil constituents, primarily monoterpenes, have been reported to exert beneficial physiological effects.
3: For example, TRP channels of the vanilloid (TRPV) and melastatin (TRPM) subfamily have been reported to enhance the re-epithelialization of cutaneous wounds in the presence of -caryophyllene [ 34].
4: Essential oils isolated from the genus  Hyptis have been shown to exert antinociceptive effects [ 35], and rue phytochemicals have been shown to impact gustation [ 36] via potential interaction with TRPA1, TRPV1, and TRPM8.
5: Finally, carvacrol, a monoterpene found in oregano, has been shown to be a potent vasodilator through activation of TRPV3 channels in rat smooth muscle cells [ 37].
