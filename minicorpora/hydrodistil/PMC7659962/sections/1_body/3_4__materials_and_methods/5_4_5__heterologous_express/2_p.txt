0: HEK 293 cells transfected with human TRPV4 (HEK hTRPV4) were a generous gift from Dr. Sara Baratchi (Stanford University, CA, USA).
1: Cell culture medium was comprised of Dulbeccos modified Eagles medium (DMEM) (4.5-g/L glucose) supplemented with 10% FBS, 1-mg/mL blasticidine (InvivoGen, San Diego, CA, USA), and 50-mg/mL hygromycin (InvivoGen) for the selection of stably expressing cells and maintained under 5% CO 2 at 37 C. Following the first passage, cells were induced overnight with 0.1-g/mL tetracycline for the expression of TRPV4 channels.
2: Parental HEK 293 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured according to the manufacturers instructions and were used as experimental controls.
