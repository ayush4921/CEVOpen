 <xref rid="B91-molecules-25-04873" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. An Agilent Innowax FSC column (60 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25-μm film thickness) was used with He as the carrier gas (0.8 mL/min). The GC oven temperature was kept at 60 °C for 10 min, increased to 220 °C at a rate of 4 °C /min, kept constant at 220 °C for 10 min, and then increased to 240 °C at a rate of 1 °C /min. The split ratio was adjusted to 40:1, and the injector temperature was 250 °C. MS spectra were monitored at 70 eV with a mass range of 35 to 450
