0: Essential oil samples were dehydrated using anhydrous Na 2SO 4 and then suspended in  n-hexane (10% w/v) for GC-MS analysis, which was performed with an Agilent 5975 GC-MSD system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), as reported previously [ 91].
1: An Agilent Innowax FSC column (60 m  0.25 mm, 0.25-m film thickness) was used with He as the carrier gas (0.8 mL/min).
2: The GC oven temperature was kept at 60 C for 10 min, increased to 220 C at a rate of 4 C /min, kept constant at 220 C for 10 min, and then increased to 240 C at a rate of 1 C /min.
3: The split ratio was adjusted to 40:1, and the injector temperature was 250 C. MS spectra were monitored at 70 eV with a mass range of 35 to 450  m/ z.
