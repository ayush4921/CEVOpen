0: GC analysis was performed using an Agilent 6890N GC system.
1: To obtain the same elution order as with GC-MS, the line was split for FID and MS detectors, and a single injection was performed using the same column and appropriate operational conditions.
2: Flame ionization detector (FID) temperature was 300 C. The essential oil components were identified by co-injection with standards (whenever possible), which were purchased from commercial sources or isolated from natural sources.
3: In addition, compound identities were confirmed by comparison of their mass spectra with those in the Wiley GC-MS Library (Wiley, NY, USA), MassFinder software 4.0 (Dr. Hochmuth Scientific Consulting, Hamburg, Germany), Adams Library, and National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST) Library.
4: Confirmation was also achieved using the in-house Baser Library of Essential Oil Constituents database obtained from chromatographic runs of pure compounds performed with the same equipment and conditions.
5: A C 8C 40n-alkane standard solution (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) was used to spike the samples for the determination of the relative retention indices (RRI).
6: Relative percentage amounts of the separated compounds were calculated from FID chromatograms.
