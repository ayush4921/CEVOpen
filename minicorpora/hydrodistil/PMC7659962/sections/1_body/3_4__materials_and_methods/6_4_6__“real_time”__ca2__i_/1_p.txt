0: For real-time [Ca 2+] i measurements, all cell types were grown as monolayers until 7080% confluency.
1: Cells were incubated at 37 C for 30 min with 5-M Fura 2-AM in complete medium, followed by two gentle washes.
2: De-esterification was allowed for a further 30 min, and then, the monolayers were mounted on the stage of an Olympus IX-81 inverted fluorescence microscope (Olympus America, Center Valley, PA, USA).
3: Cells were superfused continuously with HBSS (in mM: 118 NaCl, 4.8 KCl, 1.23 CaCl 2, 0.6 KH 2PO 4, 4.6 NaHCO 3, 0.6 NaH 2PO 4, and 5.5 glucose, pH 7.4) at a flow rate of 2 mL/min.
4: Cells were exposed to compounds under investigation by switching from the control medium (HBSS with Ca 2+) to the compound-containing medium (working concentrations of treatment prepared in HBSS with Ca 2+) for 30s, unless noted otherwise.
5: Control buffer and treatments were always kept in separate chambers to prevent any potential interaction between the compounds.
6: Relative [Ca 2+] i was allowed to return to baseline after a response before exposing the cells to any successive treatment.
7: Cells were pretreated with the TRPA1 antagonist HC-030031 (20 M) for 20 min to block TRPA1 activation with essential oils.
8: ATP (25 M) was routinely utilized to confirm receptor-effector coupling in control parental HEK 293 cells.
9: The [Ca 2+] i measurements were recorded in individual cells using a fluorescence imaging system (Easy Ratio Pro software, Horiba Scientific, North Edison, NJ, USA) equipped with a multi-wavelength DeltaRAM monochromator (Photon Technology International, Inc., Edison, NJ, USA) and a QuantEM 512SC electron multiplying charge-coupled device camera (Teledyne Photometrics, Tucson, AZ, USA), as previously described [ 40].
10: Images and real-time [Ca 2+] i data were acquired using an alternating excitation wavelength protocol (340 nm and 380 nm, 20 Hz) and emission wavelength of 510 nm.
11: Background fluorescence was automatically corrected for the experiments using Easy Ratio Pro software.
12: The signals obtained at 340 and 380 nm were calculated as the 340/380 ratio and used as an index to measure relative changes in [Ca 2+] i from the baseline [ 92] and expressed as mean  SEM.
