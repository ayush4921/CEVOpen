  <p>TRP agonist- and 
   <italic>Monarda</italic> essential oil-induced increases in [Ca

   <sub>i</sub> are absent in parental HEK cells. Representative trace (

   <sub>i</sub> in parental HEK 293 cells treated consecutively with 100 µM of allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) (#1), 100 nM of capsaicin (#2), 10 µM of GSK1016790A (#3), 20 µg/mL of MEO
   <sub>Fl</sub> (#5), and 20 µg/mL of MEO
   <sub>Lv</sub> (#6). Receptor-effector coupling was confirmed by treating the cells with 25 µM of ATP (#6). Summarized data comparing the effects of MEO
   <sub>Fl</sub> and MEO
   <sub>Lv</sub> on [Ca
   <sup>2+</sup>]
   <sub>i</sub> in parental HEK 293 and HEK rTRPA1 cells (
   <bold>B</bold>). The data are expressed as change in the [Ca
   <sup>2+</sup>]
   <sub>i</sub> influx from baseline to peak [Ca
   <sup>2+</sup>]
   <sub>i</sub> and plotted as the mean ± SEM. * 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001 compared to agonist-induced [Ca
   <sup>2+</sup>]
   <sub>i</sub> influx. Statistical analysis was performed using two-way analysis of variance; 
   <italic>n</italic> = 90 cells from 3 independent experiments.
