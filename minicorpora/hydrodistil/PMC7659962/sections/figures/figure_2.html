 <caption> Monarda essential oil-induced increases in [Ca 2+] i are blocked by HC-030031 in HEK rTRPA1 cells. ( A) and ( B) are representative traces showing the effects of pretreatment with the selective TRPA1 blocker HC-030031 (20 µM) on the transient increase in [Ca 2 +] i in HEK-rTRPA1 cells. Summarized data are shown in ( C) and ( D), respectively. The data are expressed as changes in the [Ca 2+] i influx from baseline to peak [Ca 2+] i and plotted as the mean ± SEM. * p &lt; 0.0001 compared to [Ca 2+] i elicited after treatment with essential oils. Statistical analysis was performed using an unpaired t-test; n = 90 cells from 3 independent experiments. </caption>
