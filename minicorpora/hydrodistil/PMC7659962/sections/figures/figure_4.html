 <caption> TRP agonist- and Monarda essential oil-induced increases in [Ca 2+] i are absent in parental HEK cells. Representative trace ( A) showing the negligible effect in baseline [Ca 2+] i in parental HEK 293 cells treated consecutively with 100 µM of allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) (#1), 100 nM of capsaicin (#2), 10 µM of GSK1016790A (#3), 20 µg/mL of MEO Fl (#5), and 20 µg/mL of MEO Lv (#6). Receptor-effector coupling was confirmed by treating the cells with 25 µM of ATP (#6). Summarized data comparing the effects of MEO Fl and MEO Lv on [Ca 2+] i in parental HEK 293 and HEK rTRPA1 cells ( B). The data are expressed as change in the [Ca 2+] i influx from baseline to peak [Ca 2+] i and plotted as the mean ± SEM. * p &lt; 0.0001 compared to agonist-induced [Ca 2+] i influx. Statistical analysis was performed using two-way analysis of variance; n = 90 cells from 3 independent experiments. </caption>
