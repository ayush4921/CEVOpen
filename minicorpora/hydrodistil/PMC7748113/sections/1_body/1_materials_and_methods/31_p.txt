0: The inhibitory effect of the extracts on -amylase activity was measured as stated earlier [22] with some modifications.
1: To do this, 50 l of different concentrations (0.048 to 0.8 mg/ml) of extracts and enzyme solutions were mixed and pre-incubated at 37 C for 15 min.
2: Afterward, the reaction was  initiated by adding 100 l of starch solution.
3: After the incubation of mixture at 37 C for 3 min, the reaction was stopped by adding 200 l of DNS and boiled for 5 min.
4: Next, the mixture was diluted with distilled water (3.6 ml), and the absorbance was recorded at  540 nm against the blank.
5: The control sample was prepared with the same procedure, adding distilled water instead of the extracts.
6: The -amylase inhibitory activity of the extracts was calculated in terms of the inhibition percentage using Eq .
7: (4).
