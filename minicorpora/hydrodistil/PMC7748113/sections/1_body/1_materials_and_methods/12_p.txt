0: The aluminum chloride colorimetric assay was used as explained before to determine TFC with minor changes [16].
1: Quercetin was employed as a standard.
2: The diluted extracts or quercetin (0.5 ml) were mixed with 2.8 ml of distilled water, followed by the addition of 100 l of 10% (w/v) aluminum chloride and 100 l of potassium acetate (1.0 M) solution.
3: After 40 min of incubation, the absorbance was read at 415 nm.
4: The standard curve of quercetin was utilized to determine the TFC expressed as mg quercetin equivalent/gDW.
