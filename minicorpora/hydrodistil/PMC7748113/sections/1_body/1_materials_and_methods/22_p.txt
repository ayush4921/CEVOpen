0: FRAP assay was carried out the same as before with some changes [19].
1: Briefly, FRAP reagent was prepared by mixing acetate buffer (300 mM, pH 3.6), TPTZ (10 mM in 40 mM HCl), and FeCl 3 (20 mM) in a ratio of 10:1:1.
2: Afterwards, 500 l of each sample was mixed with 1.5 ml of FRAP reagent.
3: The mixture was shaken vigorously and incubated in the dark at room temperature for 30 min before measuring the absorbance at 593 nm.
4: Ferrous ammonium sulfate hexahydrate was used to create the standard curve.
5: The FRAP value was expressed as mM FeSO 4 equivalents per gram of DW.
