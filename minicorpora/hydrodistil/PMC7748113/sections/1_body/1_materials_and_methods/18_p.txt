0: The scavenging ability of extracts against DPPH radical was evaluated by an earlier method with some changes [18].
1: In brief, 1 ml of various concentrations (0.25-4 mg/ml) of each extract was mixed with 1 ml of 0.1 mM DPPH solution in methanol.
2: The mixture was allowed to stand (0.5 h/in the dark), and the absorbance was measured at 517 nm against the blank (methanol).
3: Then 0.1 mM of DPPH solution was used separately as the control.
4: The inhibition percentage for scavenging DPPH radical by the extracts was calculated according to Eq.
5: (2).
