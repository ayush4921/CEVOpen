0: The inhibition effects of various extracts on AChE activity was determined as per a modified method [23].
1: At first, 200 l of DTNB (5 mM), 150 l of Tris/HCl buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4), 10 l of AChE, and 50 l of different concentrations (0.1-1.5 mg/ml) of extracts were mixed and incubated at room temperature for 10 min.
2: After incubation, the enzyme reaction was initiated by adding 100 l of acetylthiocholine chloride.
3: Control was prepared using the same procedure without any plant extracts.
4: The hydrolysis of the substrate was recorded at 410 nm.
5: AChE inhibitory activity was calculated according to Eq.
6: (5)
