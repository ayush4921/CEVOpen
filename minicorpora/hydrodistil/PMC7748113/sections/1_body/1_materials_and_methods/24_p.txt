0: The ability of different extracts for H 2O 2 scavenging was evaluated as described before [20].
1: Briefly, all extracts (1.5 ml) were mixed with 20 l of H 2O 2 solution 30%.
2: The absorbance was monitored at 530 nm at 5-min intervals until it remained constant.
3: The decrease in the absorbance was proportional to the H 2O 2 scavenging ability of extracts.
4: The percent inhibition of H 2O 2 by the extracts was calculated according to Eq.
5: (3).
