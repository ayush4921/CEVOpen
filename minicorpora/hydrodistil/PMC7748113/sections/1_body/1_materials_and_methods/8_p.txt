0: The chemical compositions of the essential oil were determined by GC-MS on a HP-6890/HP5 equipment (Agilent-7890A, Madrid, Spain).
1: The GC was equipped with a TRB-5MS column (32 m  0.25 mm  0.25 mm).
2: The carrier gas was helium, wirh the split injection of 1 ml at 1 ml/min flow rate, and the injection temperature of 60 - 220 C, with an increasing rate of 6 C/min.
3: The chemical constituents of the oil were identified by comparing their mass spectra with those available in the Wiley GC-MS library as well as by comparing them with those reported in the literature [13,14].
