 <sup>]</sup> with some modifications. To do this, 50 μl of different concentrations (0.048 to 0.8 mg/ml) of extracts and enzyme solutions were mixed and pre-incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Afterward, the reaction was 
 <italic>initiated</italic> by adding 100 μl of starch solution. After the incubation of mixture at 37 °C for 3 min, the reaction was stopped by adding 200 μl of DNS and boiled for 5 min. Next, the mixture was diluted with distilled water (3.6 ml), and the absorbance was recorded at 
 <italic>540 nm</italic> against the blank. The control sample was prepared with the same procedure, adding distilled water instead of the extracts. The α-amylase inhibitory activity of the extracts was calculated in terms of the inhibition percentage using Eq .(4).
