0: The antimicrobial activity of three extracts of  A. repens against Gram-negative ( Pseudomonas aeruginosa PTCC-1620 and  Escherichia coli PTCC-1338) and Gram-positive bacteria ( Staphylococcus aureus PTCC-1430,  Micrococcus luteus PTCC 1625, and  Bacillussubtilis PTCC-1720) was evaluated using the agar based-disk diffusion method.
1: Inoculum density of the bacteria was prepared equivalent to 0.5 McFarland standard and uniformly spread on the Luria-Bertani agar plates.
2: The sterile discs (6.0 mm) were placed over plates, and 20 l of the test sample was placed over the discs.
3: After that, the plates were kept in a refrigerator at 4 C for 60 min, followed by further incubation at 37 C for 24 h. Evaluation of antibacterial activity was performed by measuring the zones of growth inhibition around the disks.
