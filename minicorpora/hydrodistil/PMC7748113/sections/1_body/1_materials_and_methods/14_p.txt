0: TAC was determined by a previously described method [17].
1: Leaves of  A. repens were homogenized in acidified solvents (ethanol, methanol, and acetone containing 1% HCl [v/v]) and kept at 4 oC for 24 h. The extracts were later centrifuged, and the absorbance of supernatants was read at 530 and 675 nm.
2: TAC of all the extracts was calculated according to Eq.
3: (1).
