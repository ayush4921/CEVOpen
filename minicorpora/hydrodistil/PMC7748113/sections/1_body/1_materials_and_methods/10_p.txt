0: A former method was applied with some modifications to estimate the TPC of extracts [15].
1: Briefly, 100 l of standard solutions (gallic acid) or appropriately diluted extracts were mixed with 100 l of Folin-Ciocalteu reagent, 2 ml of 2% sodium carbonate, and 2.8 ml of deionized water.
2: Following the incubation of mixtures at room temperature for 30 min, the absorbance was recorded at 720 nm by a UV-Vis spectrophotometer.
3: TPC was expressed as mg of gallic acid equivalent per g DW (mg GAE/g DW).
