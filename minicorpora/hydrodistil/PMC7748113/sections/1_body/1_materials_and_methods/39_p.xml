<p>The antimicrobial activity of three extracts of 
 <italic>A. repens</italic> against Gram-negative (
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> PTCC-1620 and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> PTCC-1338) and Gram-positive bacteria (
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> PTCC-1430, 
 <italic>Micrococcus luteus</italic> PTCC 1625, and 
 <italic>Bacillus</italic>
 <italic>subtilis</italic> PTCC-1720) was evaluated using the agar based-disk diffusion method. Inoculum density of the bacteria was prepared equivalent to 0.5 McFarland standard and uniformly spread on the Luria-Bertani agar plates. The sterile discs (6.0 mm) were placed over plates, and 20 μl of the test sample was placed over the discs. After that, the plates were kept in a refrigerator at 4 °C for 60 min, followed by further incubation at 37 °C for 24 h. Evaluation of antibacterial activity was performed by measuring the zones of growth inhibition around the disks.
