0: A formerly described protocol was used to evaluate the ferric RP of the extracts [21].
1: For this purpose, 1 ml of various concentrations (0.1-1 mg/ml) of each extract was mixed with 1 ml of phosphate buffer (0.2 M, pH 6.6) and 1 ml of potassium ferricyanide (1%), followed by incubating at 50 C for 20 min.
2: Then 1 ml of trichloroacetic acid (10%) was added to the mixture and centrifuged (3000 g, 10 min, 4 C).
3: After mixing 1.5 ml of supernatant with distilled water (1.5 ml) and FeCl 3 (0.15 ml, 0.1%), the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 10 min, and the absorbance was read at 700 nm.
4: The higher the absorbance of the reaction mixture, the higher the RP of the extracts.
5: The extract concentration providing EC 50 was calculated from the graph of absorbance at 700 nm against the extract concentration.
6: Trolox under the same conditions was used as the positive control.
