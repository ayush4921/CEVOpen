<p>The evaluation of the antibacterial effect of all three extracts of 
 <italic>A. repens</italic> was screened against some Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, which are well-known foodborne pathogens. All the extracts 
 <italic>significantly inhibited </italic>the growth of Gram-positive bacteria in a dose-dependent manner (
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). However, no effect was observed against Gram-negative bacteria. The acetone extract showed its highest inhibitory effects against 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> with the inhibition zone diameter of 25.0 mm, followed by 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>M. luteus</italic> (inhibition zones of 22.0 and 18.0 mm, respectively). Following a similar trend, the methanol extracts exerted higher inhibitory activity against 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> than 
 <italic>S. </italic>
 <italic>aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>M. luteus</italic> with the inhibition zones of 22.0, 19.0, and 16.0 mm, respectively.
