0: Oxidative stress is resulted from a shift in the balance between the antioxidant defense systems and the formation of ROS, in favor of the latter.
1: ROS has critical roles in the occurrence of various diseases, including cancer, atherosclerosis, neurodegenerative disorders (Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases), and diabetes mellitus [3].
2: Phenolic compounds act as the scavengers of these harmful free radicals, thereby preventing or reversing their adverse effects [4].
3: Synthetic antioxidants such as, tertiary butyl hydroquinone, BHA, and butylated hydroxyltoluene are widely used in food industry [5].
4: Long-term consumption of synthetic antioxidants, however, is always accompanied with various risks for health [6].
5: To partly overcome the side effects of synthetic antioxidant compounds, considerable attention has been paid to the use of natural ingredients.
6: Many researchers have recently focused on plant-derived metabolites.
7: Besides the antioxidant activity, the secondary metabolites could also play other different roles, including inhibition of certain disease-associated enzymes.
8: For instance, voglibose, galantamine, and kojic acid are currently used as pharmaceuticals to reduce the actions of -amylase, cholinesterase, and tyrosinase, respectively [7].
9: Nonetheless, due to their side effects, many attempts have been made to find more efficient and safe alternatives, notably from natural sources [8].
