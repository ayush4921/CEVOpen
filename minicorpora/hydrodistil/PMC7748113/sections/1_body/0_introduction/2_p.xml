<p>Oxidative stress is resulted from a shift in the balance between the antioxidant defense systems and the formation of ROS, in favor of the latter. ROS has critical roles in the occurrence of various diseases, including cancer, atherosclerosis, neurodegenerative disorders (Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases), and diabetes mellitus

Many researchers have recently focused on plant-derived metabolites. Besides the antioxidant activity, the secondary metabolites could also play other different roles, including inhibition of certain disease-associated enzymes. For instance, voglibose, galantamine, and kojic acid are currently used as pharmaceuticals to reduce the actions of Î±-amylase, cholinesterase, and tyrosinase, respectively
