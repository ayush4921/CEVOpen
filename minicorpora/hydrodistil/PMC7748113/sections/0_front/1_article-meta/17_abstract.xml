  <title>Background:</title>
  <p>This study was devoted to assessing the inhibitory potential of acetone, methanol, and ethanol extracts of 
   <italic>Acroptilon repens</italic> against disease-associated enzymes, as well as their antioxidant/antibacterial activity and phytochemical composition. 
  </p>

 <sec>
  <title>Methods:</title>
  <p>Comparative assessment using various antioxidant evaluation methods, including FRAP, scavenging ability on DPPH radical and hydrogen peroxide, and RP, indicated that the acetone extract presented the highest antioxidant activity, due to its highest total antioxidant content. </p>

  <title>Results:</title>
  <p>The TPC and TFC of these extracts were 3.44 ± 0.32 mg GAE/g DW and 2.09 ± 0.2 mg QE/g DW, respectively. The hydrodistillation essential oil from 
   <italic>A. repens</italic> was analyzed by GC/MS, and 17 compounds were identified. All extracts showed good inhibitory activities against disease-related enzyme acetylcholinesterase and α-amylase, with the lowest IC
   <sub>50</sub> for acetonic extract. Extracts of 
   <italic>A. repens</italic> exhibited inhibiting activities against the Gram-positive bacteria, with the most effect of acetone extract.

  <title>Conclusion:</title>
  <p>Our findings suggest 
   <italic>A. repens</italic> as a promising source of natural antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-cholinesterase and anti-amylase agents for the management of oxidative damage, and pharmaceutical, food, and cosmeceutical purposes.
