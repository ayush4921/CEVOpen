<p>The results showed that neural network with 10 neurons in hidden layer had the lowest mean squared error (
 <italic>MSE</italic>) and mean absolute error (
 <italic>MAE</italic>) and the highest correlation coefficient (
 <italic>r</italic>) for predicting the quality and microbial properties of coated meat during storage time. The efficiency of the optimal ANN in predicting the qualitative and microbial properties of the coated meat is shown in FigureÂ 
 <xref rid="fsn31940-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>. In this figure, the actual values of the values obtained from the experiments are shown against the values predicted by the model. High correlation coefficients indicated high performance of ANN in predicting quality and microbial properties of coated meats.
