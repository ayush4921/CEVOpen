<p>The optimal structure of the artificial neural network (ANN) was obtained to model the ostrich meat coating process during trial and error. The best artificial ANN structure and related parameters are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn31940-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>. The Levenberg–Marquardt (LM) algorithm, one of the most commonly used training algorithms, was used to update ANN weights. This algorithm performs very fast network training and minimizes the level of error. In fact, this algorithm was designed to speed up network learning.
