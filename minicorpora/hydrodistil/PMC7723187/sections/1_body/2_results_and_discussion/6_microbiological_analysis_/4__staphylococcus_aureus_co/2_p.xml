<p>The results of variance of all treatment data showed that the 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> count increased significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ .05) during storage time (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31940-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). The increase in microbial load in the samples containing the coating increased with a slower gradient. Djenane et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31940-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>) investigated the effects of lavender and peppermint essential oil on 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> count in minced beef. Their results showed that both essential oils were able to prevent the growth of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> in minced meat samples compared to the control sample.
