<p>Van et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31940-bib-0063" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>) reported that increasing pH in ostrich meat darkens the meat color. Vital et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31940-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>) investigated the effect of active edible alginate coating with rosemary and oregano essential oils on beef. The results of these researchers are consistent with the present study. These researchers attributed the decrease in factor 
 <italic>L</italic>* during storage to changes in protein structure due to oxidation that may increase light scattering, and in the samples containing the coating, the reduction was less due to partial inhibition of oxygen exchange. Adding essential oils to the samples due to their antimicrobial properties slowed down the microbial activity, resulting in lower protein degradation rate and lower brightness than the control and QSSM samples.
