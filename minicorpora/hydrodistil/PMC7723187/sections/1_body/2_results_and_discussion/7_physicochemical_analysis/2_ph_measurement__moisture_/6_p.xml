<p>The results of this study were in line with the findings of Rahnemoon et al. (

These researchers investigated the effect of alginate coating containing pomegranate peel extract on shelf life, texture, and color characteristics of chicken breast meat. The researchers attributed the decrease in hardness of the samples to the destruction of the meat tissue by microorganisms. On the other hand, with decreasing water‐holding capacity due to lower pH in the QSSM and LO samples, the hardness of the samples increased and then decreased. Lowering the pH reduces water storage capacity. Therefore, the hardness was increased on day 3. On day 6, due to tissue damage by microorganisms, the hardness decreased despite lower pH. On day 9, due to increases in pH and tissue destruction by microorganisms, the rate of hardness decreased (Lawrie &amp; Ledward,
