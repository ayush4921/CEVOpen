<p>The results of pH changes of ostrich meat samples stored at 4°C are shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31940-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>. The initial pH of the samples was 5.97. Results of analysis of variance showed that pH of control sample increased during the storage. The reason for the increase in pH is the destruction of the tissue of the meat sample by microorganisms, which causes the breakdown of protein constituents and the production of nitrogenous compounds and ultimately increases the pH. In the QSSM‐coated samples and the QSSM + LO‐coated samples, due to the positive effects of the coating on microbial growth, the pH of the samples decreased at days 3 and 6 and then increased at day 9. Various studies have shown that microbial activity causes carbon dioxide production; some of the essential oils and extracts in film and edible coatings can reduce or increase the permeability to carbon dioxide (Bifani et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31940-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>). It seems that the LO in the QSSM has reduced permeability, resulting in increased carbon dioxide content in the coating, and ultimately increased carbon dioxide, reducing the pH of the samples. On the other hand, increased carbon dioxide can also reduce microbial growth. In the QSSM‐coated samples, due to the absence of essential oil, the permeability was higher than that of the QSSM + LO‐coated samples, which resulted in lower pH on days 3 and 6 and a higher pH on day 9 as compared to the QSSM + LO samples. Generally, during the storage time, the pH decreased on days 3 and 6 in the coated samples with increasing essential oil content. Significant difference (
