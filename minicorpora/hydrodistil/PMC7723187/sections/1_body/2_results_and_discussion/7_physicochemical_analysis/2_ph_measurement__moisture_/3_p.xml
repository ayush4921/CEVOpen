The results showed that the pH of the control samples increased during shelf life, but the pH of the coated samples without essential oils and coated samples containing rosemary and oregano essential oils decreased and then increased. Alizadeh Behbahani and Imani Fooladi (
 <xref rid="fsn31940-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2018b</xref>) investigated the effect of edible coating of Balangu seed mucilage and Feverfew essential oil on the shelf life of beef slices during refrigerated storage. The results showed that the pH of the control samples increased during storage due to microbial activity and production of nitrogen compounds, but the pH of the coated samples without essential oils and coated samples containing chamomile essential oil decreased during the storage period due to a decrease in carbon dioxide permeability.
