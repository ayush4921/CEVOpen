<p>The general chemical compositions of QSSM were measured, and the mean values were recorded as follows: moisture (4.5 ± 0.1), protein (3.5 ± 0.05), fat (2.8 ± 0.01), ash (5.3 ± 0.02), and carbohydrate (83.9 ± 0.03). According to results obtained by Anvari et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31940-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>), the extracted mucilage is mostly comprised of carbohydrates (61.0 ± 0.6%) and proteins (17.91.0%). The difference in results is probably due to different plant growth conditions or different extraction methods.
