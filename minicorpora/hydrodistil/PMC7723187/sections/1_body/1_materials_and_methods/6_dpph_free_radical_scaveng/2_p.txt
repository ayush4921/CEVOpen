0: Scavenging activity was performed according to Kiarsi et al.
1: ( 2020) method.
2: For this purpose, 25 mg of LO was dissolved in 5 ml of distilled water; then, 0.1 ml of this solution was mixed with 3.9 ml of methanol DPPH solution (0.1 M methanol DPPH solution).
3: The samples were then incubated for 60 min in a dark place at room temperature; the absorbance of the samples was measured by spectrophotometer against pure methanol at 517 nm.
4: Pure methanol was used to zero the device.
5: Free radical scavenging activity of the samples was calculated as percentage of inhibition (RSA) using Equation ( 1):  (1)InhibitionofDDPH(%)=100(A1A0)/A0
