0: Hydrodistillation method using a Clevengertype apparatus (power: 335 W; duration: 3 hr) was utilized to extract the essential oil from lavender.
1: Quantification of LO components was performed using a Beifen 3420A gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies 7890 A) equipped with a split injector, a flame ionization detector, and a DB5 capillary column (30 m  0.25 mm, 0.25 m stationary phase thickness).
2: To identify the LO constituents, the obtained retention profile was compared with that of known samples already analyzed by a gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890A) coupled to a mass spectrometer (Agilent 5975C) with similar column and operating conditions (Alizadeh Behbahani & Imani Fooladi,  2018b; Kiarsi et al.,  2020).
