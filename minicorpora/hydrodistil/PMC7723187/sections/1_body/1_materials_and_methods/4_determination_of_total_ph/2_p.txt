0: In this experiment, 20 l of LO at a concentration of 10 g/L was mixed with 2 ml of distilled water and 100 l of folic acid reagent.
1: After 3 min, 300 l of sodium carbonate (Na 2Co3) solution was added to them, and the solution was stirred for 2 hr, and finally, the absorbance of the solution was measured at 765 nm by spectrophotometer.
2: The amount of the total phenolic content was determined as mg of gallic acid equivalent (GAE) by means of gallic acid calibration curve.
3: Total phenolic content was reported as mg of gallic acid per gram (Alizadeh Behbahani et al.,  2019a,  2019b).
