<p>Hardness of samples was measured based on Akwetey and Knipe (
 <xref rid="fsn31940-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>) method. The test was carried out by a computer‐connected probe, TA. XT plus, made by the UK's Stable Micro System. A probe with a diameter of 36 mm (36 p/36) was used for the experiment. In this test, compression force by a 10 kg weight was applied to the specimens (2 × 2 × 2 cm) up to 50% of its initial height at a constant velocity of 5 mm/s. The test was performed on days 0, 3, 6, and 9, and the samples were evaluated for tissue hardness parameter.
