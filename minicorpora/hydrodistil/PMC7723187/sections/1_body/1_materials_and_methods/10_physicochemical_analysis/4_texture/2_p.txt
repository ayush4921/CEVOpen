0: Hardness of samples was measured based on Akwetey and Knipe ( 2012) method.
1: The test was carried out by a computerconnected probe, TA.
2: XT plus, made by the UK's Stable Micro System.
3: A probe with a diameter of 36 mm (36 p/36) was used for the experiment.
4: In this test, compression force by a 10 kg weight was applied to the specimens (2  2  2 cm) up to 50% of its initial height at a constant velocity of 5 mm/s.
5: The test was performed on days 0, 3, 6, and 9, and the samples were evaluated for tissue hardness parameter.
