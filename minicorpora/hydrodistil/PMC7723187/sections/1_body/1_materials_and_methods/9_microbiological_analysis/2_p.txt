0: Ostrich meat samples were taken for microbial analysis on days 0 (after dipping treatment), 3, 6, and 9 days of refrigerated storage.
1: Microbial culture was performed according to Alizadeh Behbahani and Imani Fooladi ( 2018b).
2: For this purpose, each of the uncoated (control), QSSM, and QSSM + LO samples containing 0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, and 2% essential oil was thoroughly beaten by sterile Chinese mortar.
3: Then, 5 g of the samples was removed and mixed with 45 ml of sterile physiological serum.
4: The solutions were thoroughly mixed with vertex for 5 min and diluted to 10 1.
5: Then, 1 ml of the solution was removed and mixed with 9 ml of sterile physiological serum and diluted to 10 2.
6: Next, subsequent dilutions (10 1 to 10 9) were prepared in the test tubes.
7: Dilutions were obtained for each sample separately.
8: Then, 100 l dilutions were removed and microbial counts were investigated by microbial culture according to the following methods:  Total viable count bacteria count in PCA (incubation at 37C for 24 hr).Psychrotrophic count in PCA (incubation at 20C for 24 hr).Mold and yeast count in SDA (incubation at 27C for 72 hr).Escherichia coli count in EMB (incubation at 37C for 24 hr).
9: Staphylococcus aureus count in MSA (incubation at 37C for 24 hr)   Coliform count in VRBA (incubation at 37C for 24 hr).
