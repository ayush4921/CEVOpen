0: The 9point hedonic method was used to evaluate the organoleptic properties of ostrich meat samples.
1: For this purpose, the samples were evaluated in terms of color, aroma, and overall acceptability (1: dislike extremely to 9: like extremely) by 15 semitrained panelists.
2: Six samples/treatments of ostrich meat were given to each panelist separately in small porcelain dishes.
3: The panelists were not aware of the experimental approach, and the samples were blindcoded.
4: Samples that scored more than 4 were considered as valid samples (Alizadeh Behbahani et al.,  2020; Nisar et al.,  2019).
