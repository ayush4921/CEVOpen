<p>Aluminum chloride colorimetric method was used to determine the number of flavonoids. LO in 0.5 ml (1:10 g/ml) and 1.5 ml methanol, 0.1 ml aluminum chloride (10% methanol), and 0.1 ml potassium acetate with 2.8 ml water distillate was combined. The solution was then incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The absorbance of each reaction compound was measured at 415 nm with a spectrophotometer (Alizadeh Behbahani et al.,
