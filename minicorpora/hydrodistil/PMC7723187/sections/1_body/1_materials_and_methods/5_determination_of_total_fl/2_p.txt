0: Aluminum chloride colorimetric method was used to determine the number of flavonoids.
1: LO in 0.5 ml (1:10 g/ml) and 1.5 ml methanol, 0.1 ml aluminum chloride (10% methanol), and 0.1 ml potassium acetate with 2.8 ml water distillate was combined.
2: The solution was then incubated at room temperature for 30 min.
3: The absorbance of each reaction compound was measured at 415 nm with a spectrophotometer (Alizadeh Behbahani et al.,  2019a; Noshad et al.,  2018).
4: The total flavonoid content was expressed as mg quercetin equivalents (QE).
