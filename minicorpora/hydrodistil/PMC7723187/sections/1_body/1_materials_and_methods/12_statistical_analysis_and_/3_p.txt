0: An artificial neural network (ANN) consisting of a set of interconnected neurons is able to estimate outputs based on input and data.
1: The designed lattice type was multilayer perceptron (MLP) in which the input layer consisted of 2 neurons (LO concentration and shelf life) and the output layer contained 5 neurons (moisture content, color index, total microbial load, hardness, and pH).
2: LevenbergMarquardt (LM) training algorithms were used to update the ANN weights.
3: This algorithm is one of the most commonly used algorithms because it makes network training very fast and minimizes the level of error.
4: In fact, this algorithm is designed to increase network learning speed based on the Hessen matrix (Salehi & Razavi,  2012).
