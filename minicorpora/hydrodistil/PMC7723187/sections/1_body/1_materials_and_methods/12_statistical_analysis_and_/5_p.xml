<p>The number of neurons in the hidden layer was optimized by genetic algorithm method. The initial population was assumed to be 100 generations and maximum 5 generations. The probability of fusion and mutation was 0.9 and 0.01, and the number of neurons to optimize was 1 to 20, respectively. In order to predict the performance of the obtained networks, the parameters of mean squared error (
 <italic>MSE</italic>), mean absolute error (
 <italic>MAE</italic>), and correlation coefficient (
 <italic>r</italic>) were used to predict the investigated parameter. In order to investigate the relative importance of each network input in modifying the output factors of the model, the relative sensitivity of the output factors to the network input parameters was also evaluated.
