0: Chemical composition and applications of watersoluble gums, also called hydrocolloids, used in foods have been well documented.
1: Most hydrocolloids are polysaccharides (gum Arabic, guar gum, carboxymethylcellulose, carrageenan, starch, and pectin) or proteins (such as gelatin).
2: Hydrocolloids are widely used in the food industry in food systems for a variety of purposes, for example, as gelling agents, stabilizers, texture modifiers, and thickeners (Koochaki et al.,  2008).
3: Furthermore, numerous studies have shown that plant polysaccharides comprise biological features such as free radical scavenging and antivirus capabilities (Jooyandeh et al.,  2018).
