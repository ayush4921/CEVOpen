<p>Edible coatings are edible films made on the exterior surfaces of a food or material (Jooyandeh, 
 <xref rid="fsn31940-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). In fact, edible coatings form a thin layer on fresh foods such as fruits, vegetables, and meat, thereby maintaining postharvest quality and increasing crop shelf life. The use of food coatings is a relatively simple, environmentally friendly, and inexpensive technology to reduce the spoilage of fruits and vegetables, and therefore has been relatively more accepted by consumers as compared to other storage methods such as the use of chemical preservatives or radiation (Saha et al.,
