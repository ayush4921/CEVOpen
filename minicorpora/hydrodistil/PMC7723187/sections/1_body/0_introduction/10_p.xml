<p>Qodume Shirazi (
 <italic>Alyssum homolocarpum</italic>) seed mucilage (QSSM) has a great potential to be used as a new source of biodegradable film due to its suitable thickening/gelling action. The majority of QSSM is carbohydrate (85.33%) with small amount of uronic acid (5.63%). QSSM has low molecular weight (3.66 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> Da) with relatively flexible chain and medium intrinsic viscosity (18.34 dl/g) at 25°C. The major sugar compositions of QSSM are galactose (82.97%), glucose (5.7%), rhamnose (5.04%), xylose (2.72%), mannose (3.04%), and arabinose (0.53%), and it is likely a galactan‐type polysaccharide. QSSM behaves like a typical polyelectrolyte because of the presence of carboxyl and hydroxyl groups. Mucilage extracted from Qodume Shirazi seed can be used as thickening, fat replacer, and stabilizer agent (Monjazeb Marvdashti et al.,
