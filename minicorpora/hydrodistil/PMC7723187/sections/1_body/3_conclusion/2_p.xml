<p>The incorporation of LO to a natural hydrocolloid, QSSM, fabricated an active edible coating for possible food packaging applications. The lightness (
 <italic>L</italic>* value) and hardness of all the ostrich meat samples were reduced during storage. From a microbiological point of view, the cold storage time for control sample and sample coated without essential oil was 3 days, and for 0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, and 2% essential oils, it was 3, 3, 6, and 9 days, respectively. The coating containing 2% LO conferred good quality characteristics to the ostrich meat and expanded its refrigeration shelf life. The results showed that neural network with 10 neurons in hidden layer had the lowest mean squared error (
 <italic>MSE</italic>) and mean absolute error (
 <italic>MAE</italic>) and the highest correlation coefficient (
 <italic>r</italic>) for predicting the quality and microbial properties of coated meat during storage time.
