<p>In the literature, there are not many studies on essential oil against 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> of this plant species. However, its insecticidal effect is confirmed in the literature through the extracts of the species, where it is documented the potential larvicidal activity against 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic>. Sakthivadivel and Daniel [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] reported in their study that the crude petroleum extract of 
 <italic>T. procumbens</italic> has larvicidal activity against 
 <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> with LC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 200 ppm and median mortality against 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Anopheles stephensi</italic>.
