0: The quantification of the antioxidant activity performed by the DPPH assay was based on the methodology proposed by Sousa et al.
1: [ 9], Lopes-Lutz et al.
2: [ 10], and Andrade et al.
3: [ 11] with some adaptations to laboratory conditions.
4: Initially, a methanolic solution of DPPH (stock solution) was prepared at a concentration of 40  g mL 1, which was kept under the light.
5: After that, six concentrations (7.81, 15.62, 31.25, 62.5, 125, and 250  g mL 1) of EO and of the positive control (ascorbic acid and gallic acid) were prepared.
6: For the evaluation, 2.7 mL of DPPH stock solution was added to a test tube, followed by the addition of 0.3 mL of the EO solution in different concentrations.
7: Then, the white solution was prepared, this being a mixture of 2.7 mL of methanol and 0.3 mL of a methanol solution of each EO concentration evaluated.
8: After 30 minutes, spectrophotometer readings (Biospectro SP-22) were taken at 517 nm wavelength [ 12].
9: The assay was performed in triplicate, and the percentage of antioxidant activity (%AA) was calculated with the following equation [ 9]:  (1)%AA=100AbsampleAbswhite100Abscontrol,where Abs sample is the sample absorbance, Abs white is the white absorbance, and Abs control is the absorbance control.
