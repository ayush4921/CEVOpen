0: The cytotoxicity of the oil was evaluated against larvae of  Artemia salina Leach, with adaptations [ 13].
1: A solution of 250 mL of synthetic sea salt at 35 g.L 1 was prepared.
2: In this, 25 mg of  A. salina eggs were incubated and exposed in artificial lighting within 24 hours for the larvae hatching (nauplii stage).
3: The nauplii were then separated and placed in a dark environment at room temperature for another 24 hours to reach methanuplion stages.
4: The stock solution was prepared to contain 0.06 g of the essential oil and 28.5 mL of the solution of synthetic sea salt, and 1.5 mL of Tween 80 were added to facilitate solubilization.
5: For the negative control, Tween 80 with solution saline (5%) was used, and potassium dichromate (K 2Cr 2O 7) (1%) was used as the positive control.
6: Subsequently, at the end of the dark period, they were selected and divided into 7 groups with 10 methanuplia in each test tube.
7: In each group were added aliquots of the stock solution (100, 75, 50, 25, and 2.5  L), and the volume was supplemented to 5 mL with a solution of synthetic sea salt, obtaining solutions with final concentrations of 40, 30, 20, 10, and 1  g mL 1, in triplicates.
8: In the end, the number of nonsurvivors for LC 50 determination was counted using the SPSS software probit analysis.
