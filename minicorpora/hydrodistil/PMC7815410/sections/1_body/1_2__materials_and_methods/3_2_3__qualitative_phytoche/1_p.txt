0: The phytochemical evaluation of the essential oil was determined by gas chromatography coupled to the mass spectrometer (GC-MS) in equipment of the Shimadzu brand, model GCMS-QP 5050A, in a DB-5HT column of the J&W Scientific brand, with a length of 30 m, a diameter of 0.32 mm, a film thickness of 0.10  m, and nitrogen as a carrier gas.
1: Thus, the operating conditions of the gas chromatograph were as follows: internal pressure of the column, 56.7 kPa; split ratio, 1 : 20; the gas flow in the column, 1.0 mL.min 1 (210C); the temperature in the injector, 220C; temperature in the detector or in the interface (GC-MS), 240C.
2: The initial column temperature was 60C, followed by an increase of 3C min 1 up to 240C; it is held constant for 30 min.
3: The mass spectrometer was programmed to perform readings in a range of 29 to 400 Da, at intervals of 0.5 s, with ionization energy of 70 eV.
