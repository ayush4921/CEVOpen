0: For each repetition of treatment, 25 larvae were used, pipetted to a 100 mL beaker containing distilled water.
1: Then, the larvae were removed from the beaker into the test vessel, thus minimizing the time between the preparation of the first and last samples.
2: The safety of the solvent in the employed concentration was verified, being also present in the replicates of the control.
3: During the experiment, the average water temperature was 25C.
4: After 24 and 48 hours, the dead larvae were counted, being considered as all those that cannot reach the surface.
