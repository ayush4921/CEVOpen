<p>In recent decades, due to the ever-growing occurrence of resistant strains of pathogens, limitations and abuse problems of antibiotics and chemical drugs have been profoundly recognized. The use of plant essential oils as complementary and alternative therapies against pathogenic microbes has attracted increasing attention.

 <xref rid="cit0045" ref-type="bibr">45â€“47</xref> reported that essential oils from 
 <italic>Hornstedtia bella</italic>, lavender and North Sardinia plants showed inhibitive activity on methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, multidrug-resistant 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>Candida</italic> spp. Coumarins have been indicated as possible sources for the discovery and development of antimicrobial agents, and their activities are related to the substitution structures. For example, the hydroxyl-substituted congeners exhibit better antifungal activity against human pathogenic fungi than those lacking hydroxylation; substitution at the C-8 position of 7-hydroxycoumarins has been reported to have strong inhibitory activity.
