<p>The results of FRAP, DPPH and PTIO assays showed the same order of antioxidant capacity, CPEO&gt;DEO&gt;D-limonene. The multiple higher effects of cold pressed oil beyond distilled oil should be mainly attributed to the nonvolatiles. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1</xref>, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid and naringin, the most common phytochemical antioxidants were only detected in trace amounts in CPEO. They were more hydrophilic and hardly soluble in the terpene matrices of essential oil due to the multiple hydroxyl groups. Therefore, OHCs were the most likely contributor to the additional antioxidant activity. Similarly, Naseri et al
 <xref rid="cit0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> reported that six furanocoumarins and coumarins extracted from Apiaceae roots were moderate DPPH scavengers.
