<p>Active hydrogens such as phenolic hydroxy- and mercapto-H are considered to mediate fast scavenging reactions. However, compounds with these functional groups were only detected at trace concentrations. The slow antiradical behavior of CPEO is mainly based on other structures in the OHCs. We propose that the most abundant epoxy moiety is a probable scavenger based on previous reports. De Almeida et al
 <xref rid="cit0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> reported the quenching abilities of (+)-limonene epoxide against hydroxyl radical and thiobarbituric acid reactive species. They proposed a sequential mechanism comprising the epoxy-ring opening and the formation of a multimembered-radical transient state. Gurak et al
 <xref rid="cit0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> found that β-carotene epoxides had a higher ability to scavenge ABTS radicals and singlet oxygen than (all-E)-β-carotene. In addition, comparatively active hydrogens such as the vicinal diol in the side chain of meranzin hydrate and 6ʹ,7ʹ-DHB, and allyl alcohol in the side-chain of auraptenol, could offer extra scavenging ability. Stobiecka
 <xref rid="cit0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> studied the scavenging mechanism of ABTS and DPPH by geraniol, a volatile compound in citrus essential oils. They found that the presence of an allylic hydrogen atom close to the hydroxyl group was essential in the reaction. Nevertheless, they were probable minor contributors due to their low concentrations in CPEO.
