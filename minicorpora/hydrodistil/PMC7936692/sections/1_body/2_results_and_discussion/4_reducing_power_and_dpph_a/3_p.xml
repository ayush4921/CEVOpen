<p>PTIO is a stable ROS and can be directly determined using spectrophotometry.
 <xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> To find the best reaction time of essential oils with PTIO, we determined the absorbance decay of the mixture at 586 nm as a function of time. The evolution of A
 <sub>586 nm</sub> within 12 h when reacted with low (10%, v/v) and high (50%, v/v) levels of CPEO and DEO is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">Figure 4A</xref>. The fact that all absorbance curves were hyperbolic-like, reaching a stable minimum at approximately 4–6 h, indicated that scavenging of PTIO by essential oils followed a slow kinetic pattern. A six-hours reaction was chosen, and the results of the effect-dose relations are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0004">Figure 4B</xref>. All the samples showed higher scavenging effects on PTIO than on DPPH. The ED50 values of ascorbic acid, CPEO and DEO were 0.24 µmol, 0.28 mL and 0.72 mL, respectively, per µmol of PTIO. ARP value of CPEO was 2.6 times higher than that of DEO (
