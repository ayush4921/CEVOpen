<p>The results of the DPPH scavenging effect as a function of sample amount are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3</xref>. The top scales indicate the consumed sample volume per μmol of DPPH; the bottom scales indicate the molar ratios of ascorbic acid to DPPH. As seen in the figure, D-limonene exhibited weak scavenging activity and could not reach a 50% clearance of DPPH. An early study of citrus essential oils and their major volatiles showed similar results in which approximately 85% of DPPH was retained after reaction with D-limonene for 30 min.
 <xref rid="cit0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Ascorbic acid, CPEO and DEO of Liangping pomelo exhibited significant scavenging effects in a dose dependent manner. Their ED50 values, as indicated with drop lines, were 0.28 µmol, 0.46 mL and 1.07 mL per µmol of DPPH. The anti-radical power (ARP) of the essential oils was calculated and shown as the equivalent amount of ascorbic acid (
