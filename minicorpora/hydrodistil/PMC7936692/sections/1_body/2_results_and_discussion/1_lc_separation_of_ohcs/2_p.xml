<p>The optimized separation of OHCs, the internal standard (IS) and a few other nonvolatile components in the CPEO of Liangping pomelo is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1</xref>. Both chromatograms of UV absorbance monitored at 325 nm and fluorescence (FL) emission monitored at 395 nm are presented. The FL emission response was inverted for a better comparison with the UV response, and large FL peaks were truncated so that small peaks were clearly shown. The retention times of FL peaks are slightly later than the corresponding UV peaks because of the series connection of PDA and FLD. As seen in the figure, from meranzin hydrate to auraptene, sixteen OHCs, including three polymethoxyflavones, ie nobiletin, heptamethoxyflavone and tangeretin which were not detected in the essential oil sample, were chromatographically resolved.
