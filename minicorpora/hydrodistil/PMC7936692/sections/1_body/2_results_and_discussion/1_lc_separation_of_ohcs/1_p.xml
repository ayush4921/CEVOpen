<p>The structural similarity of these oxygenated heterocyclic compounds made it impractical to chromatographically separate all of them under isocratic solvent conditions. Moreover, isomers such as auraptenol, meranzin and isomeranzin eluted at almost the same time in a water-methanol or water-acetonitrile gradient. Therefore, an additional organic phase, tetrahydrofuran, was introduced, and a quaternary solvent gradient was developed.</p>
