<p>Pomelo peel has been shown to contain flavanones, flavones, flavanols, coumarins and furanocoumarins, in both the free and glycosidic forms.

By using the above described tools together, we identified six furanocoumarins namely oxypeucedanin, 6ʹ,7ʹ-dihydroxybergamottin (6ʹ,7ʹ-DHB), imperatorin, isoimperatorin, epoxybergamottin and 8-geranyloxypsoralen (8-GOP), and seven coumarins namely meranzin hydrate, auraptenol, meranzin, isomeranzin, 6ʹ,7ʹ-epoxyauraptene, osthole and auraptene in the CPEO sample (

 <xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> this is the first report of auraptenol, 6ʹ,7ʹ-DHB, isoimperatorin, imperatorin and 8-GOP in pomelo CPEO. In addition, two peaks at retention times of 17.6 min and 32.9 min were tentatively identified as coumarins according to their UV and FL spectra. Therefore, the nonvolatile constituents in Liangping pomelo CPEO were mainly composed of furanocoumarins and coumarins. Two phenolic acids (p-coumaric and ferulic acids) and a flavanone glycoside (naringin) were detected in trace amounts.
