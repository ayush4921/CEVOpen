<p>To identify sample OHCs in the presence of other nonvolatiles using less selective detectors such as PDA and FLD, it is necessary to check their full spectra of both UV absorbance and FL emission and compare them to those of standards.
 <xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> UV and FL full spectra of the sixteen OHC standards were collected and are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2</xref>. All Spectra are categorized in five groups (A-E). Compounds within a group have similar spectra and substitution patterns. For instance, the five 7,8-disubstituted coumarins all have UV maxima at 322~325 nm and a small shoulder peak at 245~255 nm, and their FL maxima are approximately 394~400 nm (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2A</xref>). By checking either the UV or FL spectrum of a sample peak, it might not be able to make a correct identification from the five candidates; however, when the two spectra are used together as a double insurance, the possibility of erroneous identification will be minimized. In addition, the chromatographic retention time was always another independent measurement to confirm identification.
