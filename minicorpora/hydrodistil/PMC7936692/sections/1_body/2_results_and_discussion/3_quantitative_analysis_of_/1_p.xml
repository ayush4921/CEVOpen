<p>Quantitation wavelengths of the OHCs were set at or near their spectral maxima (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0002">Figure 2</xref>). The linear range, CF, LOD and LOQ of UV and fluorescence responses of each standard compound were determined and are shown in 
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Except for tangeretin which does not fluoresce, all the other OHCs showed commensurate results (relative error&lt;5%) when quantitated using UV and FL signals within the overlapping linear ranges.
