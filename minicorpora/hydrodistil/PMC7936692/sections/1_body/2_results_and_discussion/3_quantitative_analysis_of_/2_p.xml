<p>The total amount and molar concentrations of each coumarin and furanocoumarin in cold-pressed and distilled essential oils of Liangping pomelo are shown in 
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. To the best of our knowledge, this table shows the most comprehensive qualitative and quantitative information of the major oxygenated heterocyclic components in pomelo essential oils. The most abundant compounds in CPEO are meranzin and isoimperatorin (2.0 mmol L
 <sup>−1</sup> and 1.3 mmol L
 <sup>−1</sup>), followed by 6ʹ,7ʹ-epoxyauraptene (0.62 mmol L
 <sup>−1</sup>) and auraptene (0.51 mmol L
 <sup>−1</sup>). Only seven OHCs were detected at very low concentrations in DEO. The accuracy of quantitation was verified by a standard spiking recovery test, and the results are shown in
