<p>Furanocoumarins appear to be responsible for the majority of phototoxic reactions in humans caused by plants. The phototoxic action of these compounds is due to their ability to react with nucleobases of DNA under UVA irradiation, giving rise to cross-links in DNA strands.
 <xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> The confirmed phototoxic and photomutagenic compounds include bergapten (5-methoxypsoralen, 5-MOP), psoralen and xanthotoxin (8-methoxypsoralen).
 <xref rid="cit0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> In the current study we did not find these compounds in the CPEO or DEO of the pomelo. Other potential congeners, ie isoimperatorin, oxypeucedanin and epoxybergamottin, whose contents were approximately 350, 110 and 85 mg/L (ppm) respectively, were the most abundant furanocoumarins in the CPEO sample. However, isoimperatorin was reported to be phototoxic to rabbits at a threshold of 5000 ppm, and oxypeucedanin had a threshold of 250 ppm to Guinea pigs and rabbits.
 <xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> A recent cohort study found no significant association between the risks of melanoma or squamous cell carcinoma and dietary intake of furanocoumarins (including epoxybergamottin).
 <xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Although there is still not enough information to identify human safety thresholds of essential oils that contain various furanocoumarins, current data suggest that safety issues should not be of major concern when pomelo essential oils are topically applied.
