<p>Pomelo CPEO is characterized by high contents of coumarin and furanocoumarin epoxides. Meranzin, oxypeucedanin, 6สน,7สน-epoxyauraptene and epoxybergamottin collectively accounted for more than half (58%) of the total OHCs (mol/mol). The OHC profile in CPEO of other commercially important citrus species was summarized by Dugo and Russo.
 <xref rid="cit0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Sweet orange (
 <italic>Citrus sinensis</italic>) or mandarin (
 <italic>C. reticulata</italic>) CPEO contains no epoxides. Bergamot (
 <italic>C. bergamia</italic>), lime (
 <italic>C. aurantifolia</italic>) and lemon (
 <italic>C. limon</italic>) oils contain low proportions of epoxides (0.3%~8.3%, 3.3%~7.8% and 7.8%~41.8% respectively). OHCs of bitter orange (
 <italic>C. aurantium</italic>) and grapefruit (
 <italic>C. paradisi</italic>) CPEOs contain comparable amounts (29.9%~66.5% and 38.3%~64.8%) of total epoxides as pomelo oil; however, these two oils lack oxypeucedanin. Therefore, the qualitative and quantitative composition of OHCs can be used as a criterion to discriminate pomelo CPEO from the other citrus oils.
