0: A Thermo Accucore PFP column (i.d.
1: 4.6150 mm, 2.6 m) attached to an Agilent EC-C18 guard column (i.d.
2: 4.65 mm, 2.7 m) was used with an Agilent 1260 liquid chromatography system equipped with a photodiode array (PDA) detector and a fluorescence detector (FLD) in series.
3: The mobile phase consisted of 0.025% phosphoric acid aqueous solution (A), methanol (B), acetonitrile (C) and a mixture of water/acetonitrile/tetrahydrofuran (volume ratio 55/20/25, D) at 1 mL/min flow rate.
4: Column temperature was maintained at 30C.
5: The LC program to separate the nonvolatile components of pomelo essential oils consisted of the following linear gradients: 07 min, 33% B and 4% C; 720 min, 330% B, 434% C and 025% D; 2025 min, 3440% C and 25% D; 2530 min, 4075% C and 250% D; 3035 min, 75100% C; and 3540 min, 100% C; after 40 min, the initial conditions were reestablished.
6: Solvent A was used to make up the unlisted percentage in the gradient.
7: Detectors were set following our previous work with minor modifications.
8: 25 PDA was set to scan 210400 nm.
9: FLD was set to excite at 330 nm and scan the emission wavelengths 340560 nm.
10: Essential oil samples were diluted in hexane at proper volume ratios prior to HPLC analysis.
