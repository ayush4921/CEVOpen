<p>A Thermo Accucore PFP column (i.d. 4.6×150 mm, 2.6 μm) attached to an Agilent EC-C18 guard column (i.d. 4.6×5 mm, 2.7 μm) was used with an Agilent 1260 liquid chromatography system equipped with a photodiode array (PDA) detector and a fluorescence detector (FLD) in series. The mobile phase consisted of 0.025% phosphoric acid aqueous solution (A), methanol (B), acetonitrile (C) and a mixture of water/acetonitrile/tetrahydrofuran (volume ratio 55/20/25, D) at 1 mL/min flow rate. Column temperature was maintained at 30°C. The LC program to separate the nonvolatile components of pomelo essential oils consisted of the following linear gradients: 0–7 min, 33% B and 4% C; 7–20 min, 33–0% B, 4–34% C and 0–25% D; 20–25 min, 34–40% C and 25% D; 25–30 min, 40–75% C and 25–0% D; 30–35 min, 75–100% C; and 35–40 min, 100% C; after 40 min, the initial conditions were reestablished. Solvent A was used to make up the unlisted percentage in the gradient. Detectors were set following our previous work with minor modifications.
 <xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> PDA was set to scan 210–400 nm. FLD was set to excite at 330 nm and scan the emission wavelengths 340–560 nm. Essential oil samples were diluted in hexane at proper volume ratios prior to HPLC analysis.
