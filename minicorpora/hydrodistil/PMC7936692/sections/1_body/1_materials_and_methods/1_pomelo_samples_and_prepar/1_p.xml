<p>Fresh mature fruits of Liangping pomelo were obtained from an orchard of the National Citrus Germplasm Repository (106°43ʹ E, 29°83ʹ N; altitude 241 m). Cold-pressed essential oil (CPEO) was obtained by using a method as described in our previous study.
 <xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Briefly, the fruit flavedo layer was manually peeled and extracted using a household squeezer. The aqueous peel oil emulsion was collected and quickly centrifuged at 12,000 rpm at 4°C for 10 min. The upper-most oil layer was then collected. Distilled essential oil (DEO) was obtained by using an improved Clevenger apparatus with a second condenser as described by Chen et al.
 <xref rid="cit0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> One hundred grams of pomelo flavedo was distilled with 0.4 L of water until no more essential oil was obtained. The collected CPEO and DEO were dried using anhydrous sodium sulfate and stored at −80°C for two weeks to remove any sediment.
