0: Fresh mature fruits of Liangping pomelo were obtained from an orchard of the National Citrus Germplasm Repository (10643 E, 2983 N; altitude 241 m).
1: Cold-pressed essential oil (CPEO) was obtained by using a method as described in our previous study.
2: 23 Briefly, the fruit flavedo layer was manually peeled and extracted using a household squeezer.
3: The aqueous peel oil emulsion was collected and quickly centrifuged at 12,000 rpm at 4C for 10 min.
4: The upper-most oil layer was then collected.
5: Distilled essential oil (DEO) was obtained by using an improved Clevenger apparatus with a second condenser as described by Chen et al.
6: 24 One hundred grams of pomelo flavedo was distilled with 0.4 L of water until no more essential oil was obtained.
7: The collected CPEO and DEO were dried using anhydrous sodium sulfate and stored at 80C for two weeks to remove any sediment.
