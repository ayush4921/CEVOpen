<p>A combination of spectral and chromatographic retention information was used for the identification of sample peaks. The UV spectrum and fluorescence (FL) emission spectrum of all standard compounds were scanned and composed a homemade library. The identity of a sample peak was preliminarily confirmed by evaluating the matching degree of UV and FL spectra compared to standards using an OpenLab CDS ChemStation software (Agilent, USA). Identification was further confirmed by checking the consistency of retention time.</p>
