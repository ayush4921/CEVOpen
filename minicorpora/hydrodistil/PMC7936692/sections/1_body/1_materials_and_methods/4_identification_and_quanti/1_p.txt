0: A combination of spectral and chromatographic retention information was used for the identification of sample peaks.
1: The UV spectrum and fluorescence (FL) emission spectrum of all standard compounds were scanned and composed a homemade library.
2: The identity of a sample peak was preliminarily confirmed by evaluating the matching degree of UV and FL spectra compared to standards using an OpenLab CDS ChemStation software (Agilent, USA).
3: Identification was further confirmed by checking the consistency of retention time.
