0: where A  reaction mixture is the absorbance of sample and DPPH mixture after the reaction; DPPH solution was replaced with absolute methanol and A  sample is the absorbance of the sample and methanol mixture; essential oil sample was replaced by the acetone/methanol solvent and A  blank was the absorbance of the solvent and DPPH mixture.
1: Ascorbic acid and D-limonene were used as the positive and negative controls, respectively.
2: The amount of antioxidant necessary to decrease the initial DPPH concentration by half, 50% efficient dose (ED50), was calculated.
3: Scavenging capability was expressed as anti-radical power (ARP), which is equal to 1/ED50.
