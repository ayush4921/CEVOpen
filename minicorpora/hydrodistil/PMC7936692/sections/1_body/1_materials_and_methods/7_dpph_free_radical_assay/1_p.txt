0: The DPPH assay was carried out following the procedure described by Brand-Williams et al 28 with minor modifications.
1: Then, 0.1 mL of essential oil dilution at different concentrations as described in FRAP analysis was added to 0.7 mL of 63.4 mol L 1 DPPH methanol solution.
2: The mixture was vortexed vigorously in the dark for 120 min to ensure a thorough reaction as reported by Du et al.
3: 29 Absorbances were measured at 517 nm.
4: The scavenging effect was calculated using the following equation:  \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage[substack]{amsmath} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage[mathscr]{eucal} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \DeclareFontFamily{T1}{linotext}{} \DeclareFontShape{T1}{linotext}{m}{n} {linotext }{} \DeclareSymbolFont{linotext}{T1}{linotext}{m}{n} \DeclareSymbolFontAlphabet{\mathLINOTEXT}{linotext} \begin{document} $${\rm Scavenging{\rm{\,}}effect{\rm{\,}}\left(\% \right)} = (1 - {\rm{ }}{{{A_{{\rm{reaction\,mixture}}}}-{A_{{\rm{sample}}}}} \over {{A_{blank}}}}) \times 100$$ \end{document}
