<p>where A 
 <sub>reaction mixture</sub> is the absorbance of sample and DPPH mixture after the reaction; DPPH solution was replaced with absolute methanol and A 
 <sub>sample</sub> is the absorbance of the sample and methanol mixture; essential oil sample was replaced by the acetone/methanol solvent and A 
 <sub>blank</sub> was the absorbance of the solvent and DPPH mixture. Ascorbic acid and D-limonene were used as the positive and negative controls, respectively. The amount of antioxidant necessary to decrease the initial DPPH concentration by half, 50% efficient dose (ED50), was calculated. Scavenging capability was expressed as anti-radical power (ARP), which is equal to 1/ED50.
