<p>The FRAP analysis was conducted spectrophotometrically as suggested by Benzie and Strain
 <xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> with a few modifications. Briefly, 300 mmol L
 <sup>−1</sup> acetate buffer adjusted to pH 3.6, 10 mmol L
 <sup>−1</sup> TPTZ dissolved in 40 mmol L
 <sup>−1</sup> HCl and 20 mmol L
 <sup>−1</sup> FeCl
 <sub>3</sub>·6H
 <sub>2</sub>O were mixed at a ratio of 10:1:1 to form the working solution. The essential oils and the negative control, D-limonene, were diluted in a mixture of acetone and methanol (50:50, v/v) to form a series of dilutions at 10% (v/v) intervals. The positive control, ascorbic acid, was dissolved in the same mixed solvent at a concentration of 227.1 µmol L
 <sup>−1</sup>. Fifty microliters of each solution were vortexed vigorously with 950 µL of the TPTZ working solution for 6 min in the dark. The absorbance at 593 nm was recorded using a Varioskan LUX microplate reader (Thermo Scientific, USA). The FRAP value was determined using ascorbic acid calibration and expressed as micromoles of ascorbate equivalent antioxidant capacity (AEAC) per liter of essential oil.
