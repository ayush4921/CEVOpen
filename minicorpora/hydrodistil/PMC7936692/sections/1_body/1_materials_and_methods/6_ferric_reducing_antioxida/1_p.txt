0: The FRAP analysis was conducted spectrophotometrically as suggested by Benzie and Strain 27 with a few modifications.
1: Briefly, 300 mmol L 1 acetate buffer adjusted to pH 3.6, 10 mmol L 1 TPTZ dissolved in 40 mmol L 1 HCl and 20 mmol L 1 FeCl 36H 2O were mixed at a ratio of 10:1:1 to form the working solution.
2: The essential oils and the negative control, D-limonene, were diluted in a mixture of acetone and methanol (50:50, v/v) to form a series of dilutions at 10% (v/v) intervals.
3: The positive control, ascorbic acid, was dissolved in the same mixed solvent at a concentration of 227.1 mol L 1.
4: Fifty microliters of each solution were vortexed vigorously with 950 L of the TPTZ working solution for 6 min in the dark.
5: The absorbance at 593 nm was recorded using a Varioskan LUX microplate reader (Thermo Scientific, USA).
6: The FRAP value was determined using ascorbic acid calibration and expressed as micromoles of ascorbate equivalent antioxidant capacity (AEAC) per liter of essential oil.
