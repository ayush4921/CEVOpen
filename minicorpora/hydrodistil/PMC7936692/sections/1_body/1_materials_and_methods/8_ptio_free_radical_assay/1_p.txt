0: A PTIO radical scavenging assay was conducted following the protocol described by Li 30 with modification.
1: PTIO was dissolved in methanol at 214.3 mol L 1.
2: Exactly 0.2 mL essential oil dilution at different concentrations was separately added to 0.4 mL of the PTIO methanol solution, and the mixture was vortexed at 37C for 6 h. Absorbance was measured at 586 nm.
3: The PTIO scavenging effect was calculated using the same equation as for DPPH.
4: Again, ascorbic acid and D-limonene were used as the positive and negative controls, respectively.
