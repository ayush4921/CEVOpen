<p>A PTIO radical scavenging assay was conducted following the protocol described by Li
 <xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> with modification. PTIO was dissolved in methanol at 214.3 µmol L
 <sup>−1</sup>. Exactly 0.2 mL essential oil dilution at different concentrations was separately added to 0.4 mL of the PTIO methanol solution, and the mixture was vortexed at 37°C for 6 h. Absorbance was measured at 586 nm. The PTIO scavenging effect was calculated using the same equation as for DPPH. Again, ascorbic acid and D-limonene were used as the positive and negative controls, respectively.
