<p>Volatiles in both kinds of pomelo essential oils have been intensively studied, and they are mainly composed of mono- and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons and their oxygenated derivatives as well as linear hydrocarbons, alcohols, aldehydes and esters.

 <xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> It is known that the nonvolatiles in CPEO of other citrus species such as orange, mandarin, grapefruit, lemon and bergamot, are mainly composed of polymethoxyflavones, furanocoumarins and coumarins.
 <xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> These three families of compounds all possess a benzo oxygen-containing ring and are collectively called oxygenated heterocyclic compounds (OHCs). An important role in the characterization of citrus essential oils has been attributed to these components.
