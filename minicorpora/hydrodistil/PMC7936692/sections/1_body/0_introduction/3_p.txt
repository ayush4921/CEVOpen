0: Volatiles in both kinds of pomelo essential oils have been intensively studied, and they are mainly composed of mono- and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons and their oxygenated derivatives as well as linear hydrocarbons, alcohols, aldehydes and esters.
1: 2, 911 However, only two studies have analyzed a few nonvolatile components of pomelo CPEO.
2: 12, 13 It is known that the nonvolatiles in CPEO of other citrus species such as orange, mandarin, grapefruit, lemon and bergamot, are mainly composed of polymethoxyflavones, furanocoumarins and coumarins.
3: 14 These three families of compounds all possess a benzo oxygen-containing ring and are collectively called oxygenated heterocyclic compounds (OHCs).
4: An important role in the characterization of citrus essential oils has been attributed to these components.
