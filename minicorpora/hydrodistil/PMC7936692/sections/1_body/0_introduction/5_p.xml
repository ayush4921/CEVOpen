 <xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> This study aimed to provide preliminary evidence for the potential antioxidant therapy using pomelo essential oil and/or its major bioactive components. The first objective was to characterize the profile of nonvolatile OHCs in cold-pressed and distilled essential oils of Liangping pomelo. The second objective was to evaluate the in vitro antioxidant activities of the essential oils and determine the contribution of nonvolatiles to the activity of CPEO.
