<p>The long unnoticed nonvolatiles of pomelo essential oil were comprehensively analyzed for their composition profile and antioxidant potential. OHCs, which are mainly composed of coumarins and furanocoumarins, were found to be the major constituents of the nonvolatiles. The cold-pressed essential oil of pomelo showed a significant in vitro antioxidant potency and a long-acting radical scavenging activity. OHCs were the major active compounds contributing to the antioxidant effects. The results obtained will provide preliminary information for the further development of pomelo essential oils for the treatment of oxidation-related diseases.</p>
