 <sup>−1</sup> and an extraction time of 20 min, the influence of microwave power on yield was investigated. The results are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. As the microwave power increases, the yield gradually increases and reaches a maximum at 400 W. At a power greater than 400 W, the yield decreases slightly. A microwave extracts essential oils by desorption. With an increase in microwave power, the heating rate increases; the cell wall quickly ruptures; and a large amount of essential oils dissolves. However, when the microwave power is too high, the heat-sensitive compounds in the essential oil will oxidize and decompose, which causes a decrease in yield. The experimental results of this study are consistent with the viewpoint of Routray and Valérie

 </sup>. Usually, the microwave extraction yield will increase with the temperature, and after a certain optimum temperature is reached, further heating will not increase the yield. This result may be due to the increase in molecular migration and solute dissolution rate during the heating process. However, if the temperature is too high, the energy consumption will increase, and the extraction yield will not increase significantly. Therefore, the optimum microwave power is 400 W.
