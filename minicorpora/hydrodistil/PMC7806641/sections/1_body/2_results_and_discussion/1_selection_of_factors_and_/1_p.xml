<p id="Par13">With an extraction time of 20 min and a microwave power of 400 W, the influence of the liquid–solid ratio on yield was investigated; the results are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. As the amount of solvent increases, the yield of sweet cherry flower essential oil increases and then becomes stable. When the liquid–solid ratio is 60 mL g
 <sup>−1</sup>, the yield approaches the maximum, perhaps because as the amount of solvent increases, the contact area between the solvent and the raw material increases, and the essential oil can be fully dissolved. However, when the amount of solvent is too high, the solvent absorbs more microwave energy, and the absorption of microwave energy by the raw material decreases, which causes a decrease in the ability of the microwave to damage raw material cells, and the yield of essential oils only slightly changes
