 <sup>−1</sup> and microwave power of 400 W, the effect of extraction time on the yield of essential oils was investigated. It can be seen from Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> that with an extension of extraction time, the yield increases and then gradually becomes stable with minimal change after 20 min. In a certain period, with an extended microwave treatment time, the raw material absorbs more microwave energy; the cell rupture is more sufficient; and the essential oil dissolves more. Thus, the yield continues to rise. However, as the microwave treatment time continues to increase, the essential oil inside the raw material is completely extracted, and further increases in the extraction time have a minimal effect on the yield
