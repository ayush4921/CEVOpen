<p id="Par20">The VOCs possessed by plant flowers are secondary metabolites, which have a vital role in the pollination process of plants. Lilac alcohol, dimethyl sulfide, acetaldehyde, 3-methyl-1-butanol, 3-methyl butanal, (
 <italic>E</italic>)-2-hexenal, benzaldehyde, etc. in the VOCs of sweet cherry flowers can be employed in natural floral flavors. Among them, lilac alcohol has a lilac fragrance. Dimethyl sulfide is one of the key odorants in the production of corn, tomato, potatoes, dairy product, and pineapple

 </sup>. In addition, 3-methylbutanal is mainly employed to formulate various fruit flavors. Ethanol, linalool, 4-methoxy-benzaldehyde and lilac aldehyde have been shown to have certain pharmacological effects

 </sup>. A large amount of ethanol is observed in the flowers of sweet cherry during the full bloom period, which is caused by the change in carbon metabolism during the glycolysis of flowers. As the flower matures, respiration increases, and pyruvate, which is the intermediate product of glycolysis, enters the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The remaining part is converted to ethanol, which causes an accumulation of ethanol. The large amount of ethanol not only harms the flowers but also weakens the tolerance and disease resistance of the plant and increases the occurrence of decay. Linalool has many pharmacological activities, such as analgesic, sedative hypnosis, antianxiety and antitumor activities

 </sup>. Moreover, 4-methoxy-benzaldehyde is employed in medicine as an intermediate for antihistamine drugs, such as the antibiotic hydroxyaminobenzyl penicillin. The types, contents and proportions of VOCs of sweet cherry flowers have a strong influence in attracting pollinators to forage (e.g., the noctuid moth 
 <italic>Hadena bicruris</italic> relies on lilac aldehyde to find its host plant)
