<p id="Par17">A variance analysis was performed using the regression model equation, and a significance analysis was performed using the model coefficients. As shown in the Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref> model variance analysis results, the Model P-value of 0.0025 implies that the model is significant. The probability of this large “Model F-Value” is due to noise. Values of “Prob &gt; F” less than 0.05 indicate that the model terms are significant. R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.9318 and Adj R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.8442 are near 1, which means that a 93.18% variation in the yield (w/w) of sweet cherry flower essential oil can be explained by the model. The quadratic polynomial regression model employed in the experiment shows a high degree of significance, which indicates that the experimental data fit the regression mathematical model and can better predict the actual values of various indicators
