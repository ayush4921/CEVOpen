0: Many plants and flowers in nature emit aromas, and many aroma components are mixed to form a floral fragrance; different aroma components and their content differences provide their unique characteristics 15.
1: Floral fragrance is one of the important traits that are considered in evaluating ornamental plants.
2: The fragrances of plant flowers are derived from various volatiles released from petals or flowers.
3: Studies have shown that aroma is derived from the secondary metabolites of flowers, and major components are volatile small molecule compounds, such as terpenes, phenylpropionic acids and fatty acid derivatives 16,  17.
4: During the flowering process, the types, contents and proportions of aroma components have a strong influence in attracting pollinators to forage.
5: By volatilization, the smell of some flowers not only generates a signal to stimulate the immune response to self-heal but also has an important role in plant resistance to various stresses 18.
6: The VOCs of many plants possess obvious aromatic effects and medicinal value.
7: The research focus on floral fragrance gives attention to the aroma of flowers with metabolomics and genomics 19,  20 and focuses on the relationship between aroma components and regulatory mechanisms 21,  22.
