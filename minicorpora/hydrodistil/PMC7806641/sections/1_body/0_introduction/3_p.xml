 </sup>. In southern China, the introduction and cultivation of sweet cherries has experienced problems, such as a low rate of fruit set, serious fruit drop, unstable yield and fruit malformation, which have seriously affected the development of the sweet cherry industry in the region. Some scholars have explained the effect of temperature on the flowering and fruiting of sweet cherry introduced in the southern region from the aspects of cold demand, flower bud differentiation process and rate, embryo development, and quality and fruit setting

 </sup> investigated the bioactive and volatile compounds in sweet cherry fruits. However, related research on the VOCs of sweet cherry flowers is lacking. The aroma of sweet cherry flowers is mainly derived from its essential oil. In this experiment, sweet cherry flowers from four cultivars were utilized as the research object; their essential oils were extracted, which provide a reference for the utilization of the essential oil of sweet cherry flowers. The identification of their VOCs will provide a scientific basis for elucidating the floral fragrance formation mechanism, metabolism and regulation.
