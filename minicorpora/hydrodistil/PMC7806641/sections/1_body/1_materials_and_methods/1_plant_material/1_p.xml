<p id="Par5">The samples (blooming flowers were gathered in early April) of the sweet cherry cultivars Brooks, Black Pearl, Tieton and Summit were collected in 2020 from the Baiyi fruit tree experimental base of Guiyang Wudang at the Guizhou Institute of Fruit Tree Science (27°03′3.89″N and 106°25′47.23″E). The trees were 5 years old, and they were grafted onto “Gisela 6” root stock and planted under rain-shelter conditions in March 2015. All trees were managed with the same practical techniques. Identification of plant material was initially performed using morphological features and then confirmed by Prof. Xiang Wang at the Kaili University. A voucher specimen (No. 1033) has been deposited in the herbarium of our laboratory. The samples (well-developed flowers from the base of the shoots) from the same location were harvested from each tree. After they were washed with distilled water, the fresh samples were immediately loaded into a sampling bottle with a 50 mL-vial volume, in which the flower sample was placed. The fresh samples were tested two hours after they were transported to a laboratory.</p>
