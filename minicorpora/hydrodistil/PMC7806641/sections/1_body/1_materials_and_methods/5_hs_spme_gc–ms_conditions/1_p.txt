0: According to the best process parameters obtained by optimizing the extraction of Brooks flower essential oil, Black Pearl, Tieton and Summit flower essential oils were extracted.
1: After sampling, the 1 mL samples were immediately submitted to the HS-SPME/GCMS system.
2: Volatiles were isolated by SPME (50 C), which included oscillation for 15 min and extraction for 30 min (250 RPM) using the CTC triad automatic sampler (Extractor head: 50/30 m DVB/CAR on PDMS).
3: Gas chromatography was performed on a DBwax (30 m  0.25 mm  0.25 m) to separate the volatile compounds at a constant flow of 1 mL min 1 helium.
4: The injection temperature was 260 C. The temperatures of the column and ion source were 40 C and 230 C, respectively.
5: The temperature-rise program was followed by an initial temperature of 5 C for 5 min, 20 C min 1 with a maximum rate of 250 C and then held constant for 2.5 min.
6: Mass spectrometry (EI +, 70 eV) was determined by a full-scan method with a range from 200 to 400 (m z 1).
7: The classification was referred from NIST 2014 28  30.
