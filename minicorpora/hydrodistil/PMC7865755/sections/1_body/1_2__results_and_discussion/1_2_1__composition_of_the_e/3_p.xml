<p>A comparison of our data with those reported in the literature (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00643-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) shows some very interesting points. For our comparison and further statistical analysis, we reported all the papers related only to essential oils achieved by hydrodistillation and only obtained from aerial parts. With the exception of the populations of Corsica (France) [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-26-00643" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], Tuscany (Italy) and Liguria (Italy) [
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-26-00643" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], all the other accessions indicate sesquiterpene hydrocarbons as the main class of the oils. Among these ones, the plants collected in Montenegro [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-26-00643" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] showed a very similar profile with respect to (
 <bold>
  <italic>O</italic>
 </bold>(
 <bold>
  <italic>f</italic>
 </bold>)). In fact, in this oil, the main sesquiterpene components were 
 <italic>β</italic>-bisabolene (35.0%) and 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene (5.4%) and among the monoterpene hydrocarbons, as for (
 <bold>
  <italic>O</italic>
 </bold>(
 <bold>
  <italic>f</italic>
 </bold>)), the principal metabolites were 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene (17.5%), 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene (11.5%) and limonene (6.4%). A study on the different vegetative parts of a Sicilian population of 
 <italic>T. flavum</italic> has been published some years ago [
 <xref rid="B51-molecules-26-00643" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] but the results were not inserted in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00643-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> since the oils were obtained with a different method (microwave-assisted hydrodistillation). By the way, also in this case, the main component of all the investigated parts was 
 <italic>β</italic>-bisabolene, although, the second more abundant compound, germacrene D, was totally absent in (
 <bold>
  <italic>O</italic>
 </bold>(
 <bold>
  <italic>f</italic>
 </bold>)).
