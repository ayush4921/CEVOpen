<p>The oil of 
 <italic>T. capitatum</italic> (
 <bold>
  <italic>V</italic>
 </bold>(
 <bold>
  <italic>c</italic>
 </bold>)) (twenty-five compounds) was characterized by a huge amount of monoterpene hydrocarbons (72.7%), with 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene (27.6%), 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene (19.9%), sylvestrene (16.6%) and myrcene (8.6%) as main components. Oxygenated monoterpenes were present in a lower amount (12.2%) with 
 <italic>trans</italic>-pinocarveol (3.1%) and terpinen-4-ol (2.7%) being the principal constituents of the class whereas sesquiterpene derivatives accounted only for 5.1%. Comparison with the data reported in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00643-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> showed a good similarity with the population collected in Bulgaria [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-26-00643" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]: 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene (26.8%), 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene (9.3%), although germacrene D, occurring in a good amount (17.7%) in this accession, was totally absent in (
 <bold>
  <italic>V</italic>
 </bold>(
 <bold>
  <italic>c</italic>
 </bold>)). Moreover, the population collected in Corsica [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-26-00643" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-26-00643" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-26-00643" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] showed a high amount of pinene derivatives, although the ratio between 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene and 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene was reversed with respect to (
 <bold>
  <italic>V</italic>
 </bold>(
 <bold>
  <italic>c</italic>
 </bold>)). The absence is noteworthy in all the other oils of 
 <italic>T. capitatum</italic>, studied so far, of sylvestrene.
