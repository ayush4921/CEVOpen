<p>Hydrodistillation of the aerial parts of 
 <italic>T. flavum</italic> (
 <bold>
  <italic>O</italic>(
  <italic>f</italic>)
 </bold>) gave a pale-yellow oil. Overall, forty-one compounds were identified, representing 91.2% of the total compositions. The components are listed in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00643-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> according to their retention indices on a DB-5 column and are classified on the basis of their chemical structures into five classes. This essential oil was rich in sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (48.3%). 
 <italic>β</italic>-Bisabolene (26.8%) was, by far, the main components of this class as well as of the oil, followed by 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene (6.6%), 
 <italic>γ</italic>-cadinene (5.5%) and 
 <italic>α</italic>-caryophyllene (3.1%). Oxygenated sesquiterpenes were present in a lower amount (11.0%) with caryophyllene oxide (3.1%) as the main compound of the class whereas oxygenated monoterpenes were practically absent. Monoterpene hydrocarbons accounted for 27.0%, limonene (12.7%) being the main product, followed by 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene and 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene (7.0% and 5.4%, respectively).
