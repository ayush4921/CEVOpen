 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00643-f003">Figure 3</xref>), belonging to section 
 <italic>Chamaedrys</italic>, presented a total variance of 90.2% of the original data. The most of samples showed a cluster formation in this model, affirming a similarity in the chemical composition of these essential oils. The PCA horizontal axis explained 55.3% of the total variance while the vertical axis a further 34.9%. HCA based on the Euclidean distance between groups indicated a solution with three clusters (A’, B’ and C’), with a dissimilarity &lt;2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00643-f004">Figure 4</xref>) which was mainly due to the variation along the major axis in PCA analysis. These clusters formed separate groups in the PCA biplot (
