<p>A first Group A, in HCA analysis, the samples of

 </bold>(

 </bold>)), Serbia, whose oxygenated sesquiterpene compounds content (24.1–33.4%) differentiated them from the other oils were included. This cluster was characterized by the highest content of germacrene D (15.0%) and a relatively high content of 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene (5.1–6.9%), 
 <italic>δ</italic>-cadinene (3.6–4.5%) and 
 <italic>γ</italic>-cadinene (3.6–4.1%). A definite Group B containing the samples collected in Croatia (

 </bold>(
 <bold>
  <italic>m</italic>
 </bold>)) and Turkey (
 <bold>
  <italic>B</italic>
 </bold>(
 <bold>
  <italic>m</italic>
 </bold>)), was characterized by oils with a large percentage of monoterpene and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons; the difference between the two oils was mainly due to the O class (8.8–22.5%), which was the majority in Croatian EO.
