<p>With a dissimilarity &lt;1, group C’ was divided in two subgroups (C’1 and C’2) in both HCA and PCA analysis, and was affected essentially by the variation along the vertical axis. Subgroup C’1 was represented by Greece EOs (

  <italic>f</italic>
 </bold>); 
 <bold>
  <italic>L</italic>
 </bold>(

 </bold>)), containing a relatively high content of caryophyllene (12.2–13.5%), caryophyllene oxide (7.9–8.5%) and 
 <italic>α</italic>-humulene (5.0–6.0%). Marche (

 <bold>
  <italic>G</italic>
 </bold>(

 <italic>E</italic>)-
 <italic>α</italic>-farnesene (14.9–11.5%) and (
 <italic>E</italic>)-
 <italic>β</italic>-farnesene (5.7–7.3%) and a lower 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene content (5.1–5.7%) than the B’1 subgroup.
