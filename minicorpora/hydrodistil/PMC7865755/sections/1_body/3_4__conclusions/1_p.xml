<p>Chemical and statistical analyses (PCA and HCA) carried out on three Sicilian taxa (
 <italic>T. flavum</italic>, 
 <italic>T. montanum</italic> and 
 <italic>T. capitatum</italic>) belonging to the genus 
 <italic>Teucrium</italic>, can provide chemotaxonomic information on the taxa investigated. All EOs were analyzed by GC-MS. 
 <italic>T. flavum</italic> is mainly represented by sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (48.3%), the main class also found in most of all accessions already investigated. Sicilian 
 <italic>T. capitatum</italic> essentially consisted of monoterpenes such as 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene (19.9%), 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene (27.6%) and sylvestrene (16.6%), finding a high similarity with the population collected in Bulgaria. 
 <italic>T. montanum</italic>, on the other hand, showed a high abundance in both hydrocarbon and oxygenated sesquiterpenes (94.3%). The PCA analyses, and the subsequent analyses of the Clusters, based on the different chemical classes, represent a useful tool towards a complete taxonomic investigation, also leading to an understanding of the diversification of the genus 
 <italic>Teucrium.</italic>
