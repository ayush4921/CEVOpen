<p>The essential-oil contents that exceeded 3.0% of the total oil composition in at least one species were considered as original variables and subjected, after normalization, to cluster analysis (CA) and to Principal component analysis (PCA). The statistical analyses were performed using PRIMER 6 (Massey University Eastbourne, Albany, New Zealand) with two principal components (PC) variables and the number of clusters were determined by using the rescaled distances in the dendrogram, using a cut-off point (Euclidean distance = 2) that allows the attainment of consistent clusters. The Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and the Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) were used to comprehend the similarity among the essential oils in relation to the contents of their chemical constituents. We tested two different cut-off similarity levels (cut-off level 1 and cut-off level 2), chosen on the basis of the mean distance between clusters measure and based on the similaritiesâ€“differences between the samples belonging to the same cluster. Since the HCA analysis is a function of variables and observations, the highest correspondence between PCA and HCA resulted when we applied a cut-off of 2. A cut-off of 1 greatly increases the diversity between the analyzed theses and would lead to an incorrect clustering. The statistical analysis of the absence/presence was carried out using the cluster method of the PRIMER 6 software (Massey University Eastbourne, Albany, New Zealand) [
