0: The essential-oil contents that exceeded 3.0% of the total oil composition in at least one species were considered as original variables and subjected, after normalization, to cluster analysis (CA) and to Principal component analysis (PCA).
1: The statistical analyses were performed using PRIMER 6 (Massey University Eastbourne, Albany, New Zealand) with two principal components (PC) variables and the number of clusters were determined by using the rescaled distances in the dendrogram, using a cut-off point (Euclidean distance = 2) that allows the attainment of consistent clusters.
2: The Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and the Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) were used to comprehend the similarity among the essential oils in relation to the contents of their chemical constituents.
3: We tested two different cut-off similarity levels (cut-off level 1 and cut-off level 2), chosen on the basis of the mean distance between clusters measure and based on the similaritiesdifferences between the samples belonging to the same cluster.
4: Since the HCA analysis is a function of variables and observations, the highest correspondence between PCA and HCA resulted when we applied a cut-off of 2.
5: A cut-off of 1 greatly increases the diversity between the analyzed theses and would lead to an incorrect clustering.
6: The statistical analysis of the absence/presence was carried out using the cluster method of the PRIMER 6 software (Massey University Eastbourne, Albany, New Zealand) [ 53].
