<p>Analysis of essential oil was performed according to the procedure reported by Rigano et al. [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-26-00643" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. EO analysis was performed using an Agilent 7000C GC (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) system, fitted with a fused silica Agilent DB-5 capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d.; 0.25 μm film thickness), coupled to an Agilent triple quadrupole Mass Selective Detector MSD 5973 (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA); ionization voltage 70 eV; electron multiplier energy 2000 V; transfer line temperature, 295 °C. Solvent Delay: 4 min. The other GC analysis was performed with a Shimadzu QP 2010 plus equipped with an AOC-20i autoinjector (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) gas chromatograph equipped with a Flame Ionization Detector (FID), a capillary column (HP-Innowax) 30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., film thickness 0.25 μm and a data processor. The oven program was as follows: temperature increase at 40 °C for 5 min, at a rate of 2 °C/min up to 260 °C, then isothermal for 20 min. Helium was used as the carrier gas (1 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup>). The injector and detector temperatures were set at 250 °C and 290 °C, respectively. An amount of 1 μL of each oil solution (3% EO/Hexane

 <italic>n</italic>-alkanes (C
 <sub>8</sub>-C
 <sub>40</sub>) and the peaks were identified by comparison with mass spectra and by comparison of their relative retention indices with WILEY275 (Wiley), NIST 17 (NIST, The National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD, USA), ADAMS (Allured Business Media, Carol Stream, IL, USA) and FFNSC2 (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) libraries.
