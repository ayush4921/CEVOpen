<p>According to The Plant List [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-26-00643" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] more than nine hundred and fifty scientific plant names of species rank for the genus 
 <italic>Teucrium</italic> are present. Of these, more than three hundred are accepted names, including species, subspecies, varieties, forms and hybrids. The southern, south-western and south-eastern parts of Europe are considered as the main center of differentiation of the genus although a significant number of these species grow also in Central Asia, south-western Asia, north-western Africa, southern North America, south-western South America and Australia [
