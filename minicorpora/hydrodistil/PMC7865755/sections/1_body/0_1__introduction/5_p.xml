 <xref rid="B19-molecules-26-00643" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], belongs to fruticose chamaephytes with erect and very branchy woody stems, often with a violet–purple color, covered by a thick patented or slightly reflected hairiness, of 0.5 mm. The leaves are velvety and on the upper side glossy, dark green in color. The flowers are hermaphroditic on about 1-cm peduncles with 10 ribs and 5 teeth halfway along the tube. It is a typical species of the Mediterranean Region (Steno-Medit.), quite widespread in Sicily and it is found commonly from sea level up to over 1000 m of altitude. It participates in the constitution of low garrigues and Mediterranean shrubs on rocky substrates, rubble, debris fans and stony slopes, preferably of a carbonate nature. The analyzed samples were collected, at about 380 m of altitude, within an area of about 1000 square meters of discontinuous shrub vegetation, with evident signs of previous fires, physiognomized by
