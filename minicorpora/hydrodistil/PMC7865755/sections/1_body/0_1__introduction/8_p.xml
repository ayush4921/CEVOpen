<p>The chemical compositions of the essential oils of three Sicilian accessions 
 <italic>Teucrium</italic>, namely 
 <italic>T. siculum</italic>, 
 <italic>T. fruticans</italic>, and 
 <italic>T. scordium</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>scordioides</italic> have been recently published [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-26-00643" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Consequently, in the frame of our ongoing research on Sicilian plants [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-26-00643" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-26-00643" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-26-00643" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-26-00643" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and in order to improve the knowledge on genus 
 <italic>Teucrium</italic>, we decided to investigate the chemical compositions of the other three Sicilian taxa of 
 <italic>Teucrium</italic>, which have never been analyzed: 
 <italic>T. flavum</italic>, belonging to Section 
 <italic>Chamaedrys</italic>, and 
 <italic>T. montanum</italic> and 
 <italic>T. capitatum</italic>, belonging to Section 
 <italic>Polium</italic>. We also screened the reported literature in order to find data concerning the chemical composition of their essential oils and we performed Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) and Principal Component Analyses (PCA) in order to find a similarity among the Sicilian accessions and the other taxa belonging the same species studied so far.
