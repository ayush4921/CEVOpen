0: The chemical compositions of the essential oils of three Sicilian accessions  Teucrium, namely  T. siculum,  T. fruticans, and  T. scordium subsp.
1: scordioides have been recently published [ 20].
2: Consequently, in the frame of our ongoing research on Sicilian plants [ 21, 22, 23, 24], and in order to improve the knowledge on genus  Teucrium, we decided to investigate the chemical compositions of the other three Sicilian taxa of  Teucrium, which have never been analyzed:  T. flavum, belonging to Section  Chamaedrys, and  T. montanum and  T. capitatum, belonging to Section  Polium.
3: We also screened the reported literature in order to find data concerning the chemical composition of their essential oils and we performed Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) and Principal Component Analyses (PCA) in order to find a similarity among the Sicilian accessions and the other taxa belonging the same species studied so far.
