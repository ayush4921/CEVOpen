 <p>The chemical composition and the qualitative and quantitative variability of the essential oils of three taxa belonging to the 
  <italic>Teucrium</italic> genus were studied. The investigated taxa, that grow wild in Sicily, were 
  <italic>Teucrium flavum</italic> L. (section 
  <italic>Chamaedrys</italic> (Mill.) Scheb.), 
  <italic>Teucrium montanum</italic> and 
  <italic>Teucrium capitatum</italic> L. of section 
  <italic>Polium</italic> (Mill.) Scheb. Essential oils were extracted by hydrodistillation and analyzed by GC-MS. In total, 74 compounds were identified. Sesquiterpene hydrocarbons were found to be the main group for 
  <italic>T. flavum</italic> (48.3%). 
  <italic>T. capitatum</italic> consisted essentially of monoterpene hydrocarbons (72.7%), with 
  <italic>α</italic>-pinene (19.9%), 
  <italic>β</italic>-pinene (27.6%) and sylvestrene (16.6%) as the most abundant compounds whereas ledene oxide (12.1%), epiglobulol (13.5%) and longifolenaldehyde (14.5%) were identified as the main constituents among the oxygenated sesquiterpenes (63.5%) of 
  <italic>T. montanum</italic>. Furthermore, a complete literature review on the composition of the essential oils of all the other accessions of these 
  <italic>Teucrium</italic> taxa, studied so far, was performed. Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) and Principal Component Analyses (PCA) were used in order to demonstrate geographical variations in the composition of the essential oils.
