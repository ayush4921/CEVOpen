 <caption> Detection of early and late apoptosis in A2780 cells (72 h) treated with A. membranacea essential oil ( A, B), and 1,8-cineole ( C, D). Dot histograms ( A, C): x-axis: annexin V, y-axis: propidium iodide. C1: necrotic cells, C2: late apoptotic cells, C3: live cells, C4: early apoptotic cells. Data shown are % mean ± SD ( n = 3). All experiments were performed three times. Statistical differences, compared to untreated control cells, were assessed by a one-way ANOVA with the Tukey’s post-hoc multiple comparison test. p &lt; 0.05 (*), p &lt; 0.01 (**) and p &lt; 0.001 (***) were taken as significant. </caption>
