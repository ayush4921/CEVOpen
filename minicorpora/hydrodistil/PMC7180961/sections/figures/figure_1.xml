  <p>Detection of early and late apoptosis in A2780 cells (72 h) treated with 
   <italic>A. membranacea</italic> essential oil (
   <bold>A</bold>,
   <bold>B</bold>), and 1,8-cineole (
   <bold>C</bold>,
   <bold>D</bold>). Dot histograms (
   <bold>A</bold>,
   <bold>C</bold>): x-axis: annexin V, y-axis: propidium iodide. C1: necrotic cells, C2: late apoptotic cells, C3: live cells, C4: early apoptotic cells. Data shown are % mean ± SD (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3). All experiments were performed three times. Statistical differences, compared to untreated control cells, were assessed by a one-way ANOVA with the Tukey’s post-hoc multiple comparison test. 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 (*), 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 (**) and 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 (***) were taken as significant.
