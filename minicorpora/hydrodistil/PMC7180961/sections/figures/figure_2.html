 <caption> Flow cytometry showing the effect of A. membranacea EO ( A, B) and 1,8-cineole ( C, D) on cell cycle distribution after 72 h treatment in A2780 cells. A, C: X-axis: DNA content of 20,000 events, y axis: % cell number ( n = 3, experiments were repeated 3×). Statistical differences, compared to untreated control cells, were assessed by a one-way ANOVA with the Tukey’s post-hoc multiple comparison test. p &lt; 0.05 (*), p &lt; 0.01 (**) and p &lt; 0.001 (***) were taken as significant. </caption>
