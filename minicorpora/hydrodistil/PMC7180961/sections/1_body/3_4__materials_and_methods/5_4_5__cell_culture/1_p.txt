0: Three human cancerous (MCF7, A2780 and HT29) and one fibroblast (MRC5) cell lines were used in this study.
1: Cancer cells were maintained in RPMI-1640, and MRC5 cells were maintained in EMEM media.
2: All media were supplemented with FBS (10%), sodium pyruvate (1 mM), L-glutamine (2 mM) and penicillin/streptomycin (1%).
3: Cell cultures were kept on 5% CO 2 in humidified incubator at 37 C.
