<p>Three human cancerous (MCF7, A2780 and HT29) and one fibroblast (MRC5) cell lines were used in this study. Cancer cells were maintained in RPMI-1640, and MRC5 cells were maintained in EMEM media. All media were supplemented with FBS (10%), sodium pyruvate (1 mM), L-glutamine (2 mM) and penicillin/streptomycin (1%). Cell cultures were kept on 5% CO
