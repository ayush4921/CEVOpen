<p>Cells were seeded in 96-well plates and exposed to the essential oil of 
 <italic>A. membranacea</italic> at concentrations up to 100 μg/mL for 72 h. 1,8-cineole and doxorubicin concentrations were made up to 50 µM also for 72 h. MTT assay was then performed as previously reported [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-25-01582" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Absorbances were measured using a multi-plate reader at a wavelength 550 nm. IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were determined by calculated the oil concentration-induced 50% reduction in the absorbance compared to untreated control.
