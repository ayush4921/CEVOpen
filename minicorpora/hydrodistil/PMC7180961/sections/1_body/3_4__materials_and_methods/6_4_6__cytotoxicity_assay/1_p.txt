0: Cells were seeded in 96-well plates and exposed to the essential oil of  A. membranacea at concentrations up to 100 g/mL for 72 h. 1,8-cineole and doxorubicin concentrations were made up to 50 M also for 72 h. MTT assay was then performed as previously reported [ 43].
1: Absorbances were measured using a multi-plate reader at a wavelength 550 nm.
2: IC 50 values were determined by calculated the oil concentration-induced 50% reduction in the absorbance compared to untreated control.
