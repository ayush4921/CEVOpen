0: A2780 cells were seeded at 1  10 5 cells/well in 6-wellplate overnight before being treated with either  A. membranacea or 1,8-cineole essential oils at four concentrations ranged from 0 to 50 g/mL, or 0 to 1 M, respectively.
1: Cells were then suspended by trypsin-EDTA and spun at 200  g for 5 min.
2: Collected cell pellets were washed in ice-cold PBS before they were fixed in 70% ice-cold ethanol overnight.
3: The cell cycle analysis was then performed and analyzed for 20,000 events per sample, using flow cytometry (FC500, BC, USA), following the protocol described elsewhere [ 45, 46].
