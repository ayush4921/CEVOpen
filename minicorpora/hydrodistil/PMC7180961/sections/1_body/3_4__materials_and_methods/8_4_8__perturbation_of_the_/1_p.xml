 <italic>A. membranacea</italic> or 1,8-cineole essential oils at four concentrations ranged from 0 to 50 μg/mL, or 0 to 1 µM, respectively. Cells were then suspended by trypsin-EDTA and spun at 200×

The cell cycle analysis was then performed and analyzed for 20,000 events per sample, using flow cytometry (FC500, BC, USA), following the protocol described elsewhere [
