<p>The induction of apoptosis activity of 
 <italic>A. membranacea</italic> EO and 1,8-cineole was investigated by annexin V FITC/Propidium iodide protocol as described in the literature [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-25-01582" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Briefly, A2780 cells were seeded at 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well in 6-well plate overnight before treatment with either 
 <italic>A. membranacea</italic> EO or 1,8-cineole at four concentrations, ranging from 0 to 50 μg/mL, or 0–1 µM, respectively (representing IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 0, ×1, ×2 and ×4). Following treatment, cells were collected (including the supernatant), washed with ice-cold PBS and then incubated for 2 min in binding buffer (100 µL) and annexin V FITC (10 μL), at room temperature in the dark. Additional 400 μL of binding buffer and 10 μL PI were then added. The early apoptotic, late apoptotic, and necrotic cell populations were analyzed by flow cytometry (FC500, Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA), based on 20,000 events per sample.
