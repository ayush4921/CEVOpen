0: The induction of apoptosis activity of  A. membranacea EO and 1,8-cineole was investigated by annexin V FITC/Propidium iodide protocol as described in the literature [ 44].
1: Briefly, A2780 cells were seeded at 1  10 5 cells/well in 6-well plate overnight before treatment with either  A. membranacea EO or 1,8-cineole at four concentrations, ranging from 0 to 50 g/mL, or 01 M, respectively (representing IC 50: 0, 1, 2 and 4).
2: Following treatment, cells were collected (including the supernatant), washed with ice-cold PBS and then incubated for 2 min in binding buffer (100 L) and annexin V FITC (10 L), at room temperature in the dark.
3: Additional 400 L of binding buffer and 10 L PI were then added.
4: The early apoptotic, late apoptotic, and necrotic cell populations were analyzed by flow cytometry (FC500, Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA), based on 20,000 events per sample.
