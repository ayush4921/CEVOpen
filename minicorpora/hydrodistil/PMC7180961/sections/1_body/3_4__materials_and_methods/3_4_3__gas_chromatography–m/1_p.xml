<p>The hydrodistilled EO of 
 <italic>A. membranacea</italic> was diluted to 5% in HPLC-grade 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane and then injected into a Varian CP-3800 GC-MS apparatus (GC-EI-MS, Varian, Inc. Palo Alto, CA, USA) equipped with a DB-5 capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm; coating thickness 0.25 μm) and a Varian Saturn 2000 ion trap mass detector (Varian, Inc. Palo Alto, CA, USA). Analytical conditions were as previously reported [

 <italic>n</italic>-hydrocarbons, commercial libraries such as NIST 14 and ADAMS and a homemade mass-spectral library of pure compounds were used to compare the mass spectra [
