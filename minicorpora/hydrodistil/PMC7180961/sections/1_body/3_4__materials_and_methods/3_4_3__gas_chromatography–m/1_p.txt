0: The hydrodistilled EO of  A. membranacea was diluted to 5% in HPLC-grade  n-hexane and then injected into a Varian CP-3800 GC-MS apparatus (GC-EI-MS, Varian, Inc. Palo Alto, CA, USA) equipped with a DB-5 capillary column (30 m  0.25 mm; coating thickness 0.25 m) and a Varian Saturn 2000 ion trap mass detector (Varian, Inc. Palo Alto, CA, USA).
1: Analytical conditions were as previously reported [ 40].
2: The identification of the constituents was based on the comparison of the retention times with those of authentic samples, comparing their linear retention indices relative to the series of  n-hydrocarbons, commercial libraries such as NIST 14 and ADAMS and a homemade mass-spectral library of pure compounds were used to compare the mass spectra [ 41, 42].
