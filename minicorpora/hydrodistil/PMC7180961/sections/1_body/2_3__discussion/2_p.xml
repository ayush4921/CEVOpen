<p>In a previous published study, we reported the marginal cytotoxic effect of the methanol extract of the aerial parts of 
 <italic>A. membranacea</italic> on Jukart cells, with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 60 ± 5.1 μg/mL [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-25-01582" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. That extract, however, did not exert any cytotoxic effect on MCF7 or A2780 cancer cell lines (IC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 200 μg/mL) [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-25-01582" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The growth of A2780 cells in this study was, however, significantly inhibited (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 12.99 μg/mL) by 
 <italic>A. membranacea</italic> EO, since the natural product components are generally considered cytotoxic when their IC
 <sub>50</sub> is ≤ 20 μg/mL [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-25-01582" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The tested EO resulted in the cytotoxicity of the A2780 cell line, while its effect on MCF7was negligible (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 50.86 μg/mL). In this study, both the EO and 1,8-cineole induced apoptosis in A2780 cells; but 1,8-cineole induced more early apoptosis with minimal late apoptosis and necrosis, compared to a major induction of late apoptosis by the EO at the same time point. The EO also caused 4%–20% necrotic events in A2780 cells compared to control cells, indicating the possible effect of other components. The improved cytotoxic and apoptotic activities of 1,8-cineole compared to 
 <italic>A. membranacea</italic> indicates the possible involvement of one major mechanism of action in 
 <italic>A. membranacea</italic> EO
 <italic>,</italic> while the substantial difference between the activities of the EO and the methanol extract of the aerial parts could be due to the difference in the constituents of each extract.
