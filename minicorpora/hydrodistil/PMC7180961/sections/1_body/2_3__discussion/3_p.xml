<p>Furthermore, the cell cycle perturbation results of the present work were similar to those observed in a previous study conducted on wild-type p53 H460 cells (but not mutant p53 H460 cells) after the treatment with 
 <italic>Achillea millefolium</italic> hydroalcoholic extract [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-25-01582" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Pereira et al. (2018) demonstrated the induction of apoptosis and S-phase arrest, with an increased level of p53 and p21 indicating the different mechanisms involved in the 
 <italic>Achillea millefolium</italic> extract-induced growth arrest. Likewise, a previous study reported that casticin, a flavonoid extracted from 
 <italic>Achillea millefolium</italic>, caused G
 <sub>2</sub>/M arrest in HCT116 colon cancer cells, which was confirmed by the induction of p21 and down-regulation of CDK1[
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-25-01582" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, 1,8 cineole was reported to induce cell cycle arrest in the G
 <sub>2</sub>/M phase in the HCT116 cell line [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-25-01582" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], while the studied 
 <italic>A. membranacea</italic> EO and 1,8 cineole induced preG
 <sub>1</sub> increase, which indicate DNA fragmentation and confirm the pro-apoptotic effect in A2780 cells. Further mechanistic studies of the activities of 
 <italic>A. membranacea</italic> components and 1,8 cineole against an array of cancer cell lines are worthwhile, as well as 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies, which will provide more support for their application.
