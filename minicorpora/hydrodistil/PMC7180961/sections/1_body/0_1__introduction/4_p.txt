0: The EO of many  Achillea species possesses several biological and pharmacological activities.
1: It is antimicrobial, antimalarial, insecticidal, phytotoxic, anti-inflammatory and antihemorrhoidal [ 16, 17, 18, 19, 20].
2: Anticancer and cytotoxic effects were reported for the extracts of some  Achillea species, including  A. clavennae L. and  A. millefolium L., the iso-seco-guaianolide, which was isolated from  A. clavennae L., exhibited potent antiproliferative and apoptotic effects on U251 and glioma cell lines, with a potency comparable to that of cisplatin [ 21], mediated by its oxidative and mitotic activities.
3: Another compound, casticin, showed multiple antitumor activities.
4: Casticin, which was isolated from  A. millefolium L. through HPLC, showed cytotoxic, early apoptosis, G 2/M cell cycle arrest and consequently disruption of the mitotic spindle in two MCF7 sublines [ 22].
5: In a previous study, the methanol extract of  A. membranacea exerted a moderate cytotoxic effect upon Jurkat cells (T-cell leukemia) using the MTT assay [ 23].
