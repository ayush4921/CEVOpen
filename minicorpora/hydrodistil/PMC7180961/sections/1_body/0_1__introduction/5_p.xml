<p>As a part of an ongoing research program on the Middle Eastern plants bioactivity [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-25-01582" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], we have selected 
 <italic>A. membranacea</italic> for this study with the aim to analyze the composition of the EO of 
 <italic>A. membranacea</italic> collected in Jordan and to evaluate its cytotoxic activity against breast (MCF7), ovary (A2780) and colon (HT29) cancer cell lines, and non-tumorigenic human fetal lung fibroblasts (MRC5 cells). Moreover, its effects on apoptosis and cell cycle effect of the EO on A2780 cells were investigated. Beside the EO, we have tested the cytotoxicity, induction of apoptosis and cell cycle effect of its major constituent, 1,8-cineole, against A2780 cell line, disclosing the possible action mechanism of the EO and its major constituent.
