<p>The EO of many 
 <italic>Achillea</italic> species possesses several biological and pharmacological activities. It is antimicrobial, antimalarial, insecticidal, phytotoxic, anti-inflammatory and antihemorrhoidal [

 <italic>Achillea</italic> species, including 
 <italic>A. clavennae</italic> L. and 
 <italic>A. millefolium</italic> L., the iso-seco-guaianolide, which was isolated from 
 <italic>A. clavennae</italic> L., exhibited potent antiproliferative and apoptotic effects on U251 and glioma cell lines, with a potency comparable to that of cisplatin [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-25-01582" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], mediated by its oxidative and mitotic activities. Another compound, casticin, showed multiple antitumor activities. Casticin, which was isolated from 
 <italic>A. millefolium</italic> L. through HPLC, showed cytotoxic, early apoptosis, G
 <sub>2</sub>/M cell cycle arrest and consequently disruption of the mitotic spindle in two MCF7 sublines [

 <italic>A. membranacea</italic> exerted a moderate cytotoxic effect upon Jurkat cells (T-cell leukemia) using the MTT assay [
