<p>In order to explore the mechanism of action, the induction of apoptosis by 
 <italic>A. membranacea</italic> EO on A2780 cells was investigated at the same time-point of testing the cytotoxicity (72 h) to confirm its apoptotic 
 <italic>vs</italic> necrotic properties. The EO showed a dose-dependent increase of combined early and late apoptosis in A2780 cells, although its effect at the 25 and 50 µg/mL was close. The EO caused mainly a late apoptosis compared to early apoptosis in A2780 cells. There was also an increase in the necrotic events from 4% to 20% at the three doses (

The situation was inverted when 1,8-cineole was used alone in A2780 cells at the same time-point, as it caused a dose-dependent increase in early apoptosis up to 37% at 1 µM, with only 2% late apoptosis and negligible necrotic effect (
