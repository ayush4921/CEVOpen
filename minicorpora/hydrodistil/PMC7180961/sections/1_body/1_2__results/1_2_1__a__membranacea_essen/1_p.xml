<p>The complete composition of the essential oil (EO) hydrodistilled from 
 <italic>A. membranacea</italic> aerial parts is reported in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-01582-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. A total of 96 compounds were identified, accounting for 92.0% of the total composition, which was chiefly made up of monoterpenes. In particular, over 45% of the total was constituted by oxygenated monoterpenes, of which 1,8-cineole was the most represented: exhibiting a relative abundance of 21.7%, it was also the most abundant compound in the EO. Other quantitatively relevant compounds of this chemical class were borneol and 
 <italic>trans</italic>-pinocarveol, whose relative concentrations were 4.3% and 3.1%, respectively. Non-terpene derivatives accounted for up to 22.4%, making them the second most abundant detected chemical class of compounds in the EO. Among them, aldehydes prevailed (12.7%), with decanal and (
 <italic>Z</italic>)-4-decenal being the most abundant; hydrocarbons followed, accounting for up to 5.0%. Sesquiterpenes were almost equally represented by their hydrocarbon and oxygenated forms (6.7% and 6.9%, respectively). Among the former, Î±-cadinene was the most represented, while spathulenol was the most abundant of the latter class. Apocarotenes and phenylpropanoids followed, with relative concentrations of 4.2% and 3.9%, respectively.
