<p>The cytotoxic activity of 
 <italic>A. membranacea</italic> EO against the tested cell lines is reported in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-01582-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. It induced significant growth inhibition in ovarian (A2780) and colorectal (HT29) cells (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 12.99 and 14.02 μg/mL, respectively). Negligible toxicity was noticed, however, in treated breast cancer (MCF7) and human fetal lung fibroblast (MRC5) cells (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 50.86 μg/mL and IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 49.25 μg/mL, respectively). The EO was four times more selective for A2780 and HT29 cell lines compared to MRC5 cells (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 49.25 μg/mL). The major component, 1,8-cineole, was selected for further cytotoxicity assessments. 1,8-Cineole showed remarkable cytotoxicity compared to 
 <italic>A. membranacea</italic> EO in A2780 cells (0.26 μM); its selectivity was 42 times higher for A2780 compared to MRC5 cells (10.5 μM). Using the same cell lines, the selectivity profile of 1,8-cineole was better compared to doxorubicin, as the latter showed only a twofold improvement in selectivity (
