<p>The cell-cycle analysis on 
 <italic>A. membranacea</italic> EO treated A2780 cells was performed (72 h), showing a non-dose dependent slight S arrest at 12.5 and 50 μg/mL. Moreover, the EO caused a 10% increase in the preG1 at the expense of G
 <sub>1</sub> and G
 <sub>2</sub>/M decreased events (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-01582-f002">Figure 2</xref>A,B). 1,8-Cineole also caused S phase arrest only at 12.5 μg/mL, but it induced a 15-20-fold sharp dose dependent increase in the preG
 <sub>1</sub> apoptotic events in A2780 cells (
