 <caption> Inhibition of biofilm formation by nanostructured bioactive coating surfaces. ( A) The uncoated surface allows the adherence of planktonic cells (cells in suspension) with the subsequent production of exopolysaccharides (or glycocalyx) (I) that enclose the sessile cells (adherent cells), forming a mature biofilm (II) and at a later stage can detach from the aggregate and initiate a new cycle of colonization of the same or new surfaces (III). ( B) A bioactive coating allows the inhibition of the first stage of the biofilm formation: the bacterial adherence and the production of glycocalyx (I). Sessile cells are not able to multiplicate inside the aggregate and the layer of glycocalyx is thinner (II), resulting in a deficient mature biofilm that will collapses (III). </caption>
