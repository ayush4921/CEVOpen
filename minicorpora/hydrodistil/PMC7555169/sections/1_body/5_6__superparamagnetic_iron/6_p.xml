<p>Iron oxide nanoparticles functionalized with patchouli essential oil, with unknown chemical composition, were used to develop a biocompatible coating for wound dressings using the coprecipitation of a precursor in an alkaline solution of patchouli oil [

 <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCC 25923) activity after 24 and 48 h, but after 72 h, its anti-biofilm action reduced markedly in contrast with that previous reported for magnetite nanoparticles functionalized with poly lactic acid/chitosan polymers and the essential oil isolated from 
 <italic>Melissa officinalis</italic>, according to the study of Grumezescu et al. [
 <xref rid="B165-ijms-21-06633" ref-type="bibr">165</xref>]. In this case, and in order to test the anti-biofilm properties of the nanoparticles, they were distrubuted on wells of a 6-well microplate, and the bacterial suspension was added and its viability was determined over 72 h. The authors observed that throughout this time interval, the biofilms formed on the nanomodified coating was significantly lower (&lt;3 times) in comparison with biofilms established on uncoated surfaces, evidencing the advantage of using natural bioactive compounds that can be useful to combat resistant forms of bacterial pathogens. The method of Matrix-Assisted Pulsed Laser Evaporation (MAPLE) was used to produce the bioactive film containing magnetite nanoparticles and the 
 <italic>Melissa</italic> essential oil that was mainly constituted by 28% limonene, 31% β-citronellal, 15% β-citral, 9% α-citral, and 8% caryophyllene. In this experiment, the biological activity extends over a longer period of time than that previously reported [
