 <italic>Candida</italic> species can be a problem in prosthetic device-related infections; also, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> are a concern in wound infections. Anghel et al. [
 <xref rid="B146-ijms-21-06633" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>] studied the antimicrobial capacity of magnetite-based nanostructures obtained by wet chemical precipitation using sodium palmitate as surfactant and functionalized with some volatiles (eugenol or limonene). They also studied their anti-adherence properties in order to evaluate the anti-biofilm formation by those microorganisms on a cotton-based material generally used for covering infected wounds. This approach had also the capacity of stabilizing and controlling the release of the volatiles that under the free form would volatilize and would be no more present after some hours of application on the cotton surface. Those authors [
 <xref rid="B146-ijms-21-06633" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>] showed that nanofluid coating containing limonene affected both the initial stage of biofilm formation and its development after 1, 2, or 3 days on coated textile materials for 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>; nevertheless, the effect of nanofluid coating containing eugenol was more pronounced on adherence and initial biofilm formation in comparison with the limonene-based one for 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. These results proved that the functionalized textile material cumulated the anti-adherence ability of magnetite nanoparticles with the antimicrobial activity of eugenol and limonene against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, which were frequently detected in cutaneous wound infections, without their release by volatilization, [

 <xref rid="B161-ijms-21-06633" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>] but replacing limonene and eugenol by carvone against the growth of 
 <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> strains and in the inhibition of biofilm formation on the traditional cotton wound dressing, which is used for covering infected wounds. The authors [
 <xref rid="B161-ijms-21-06633" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>] found that the functionalized magnetite nanoparticles/stearic acid with carvone applied on the cotton surface acted in the initial steps of biofilm formation (adherence and micro-colonies forming) as well as in the development of mature biofilms (activity checked after 3 days). Anghel et al. [
 <xref rid="B162-ijms-21-06633" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>] found that the 
 <italic>Satureja hortensis</italic> essential oil, mainly constituted by carvacrol and Î³-terpinene, when associated with functionalized magnetite nanoparticles/oleic acid also inhibited not only the adherence of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> on the cotton wound dressing but also the development of biofilm.
