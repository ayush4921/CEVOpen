<p>Iordache et al. [

 <xref rid="B165-ijms-21-06633" ref-type="bibr">165</xref>], but instead of the essential oil of 
 <italic>M. officinalis</italic>, they used the essential oil of 
 <italic>Cinnamomi aetheroleum</italic> in the functionalization of the bioactive thin film constituted by poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid/chitosan microsphere coatings containing essential oil. The authors observed that the biofilm formed by 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCC 25923 was inhibited in the coated surfaces with the funtionalized magnetite nanoparticles over 72 h in comparison with uncoated surfaces. Together, the studies performed by Grumezescu et al. [

 <xref rid="B166-ijms-21-06633" ref-type="bibr">166</xref>] demonstrated that the MAPLE method of formulation for nanostructured bioactive surfaces can afford an efficient way to deliver antimicrobial molecules in a controlled mode inhibiting the ability of bacterial pathogens to form biofilm.
