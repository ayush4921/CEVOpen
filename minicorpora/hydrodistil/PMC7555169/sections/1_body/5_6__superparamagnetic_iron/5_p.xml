In previous studies and as aforementioned, magnetite nanoparticles with adequate surfactants (oleic acid, sodium palmitate) associated with other essential oils with unknown chemical composition showed to be able to inhibit the adherence of clinical yeasts strains and as well Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria or their biofilm formation not only on cotton wound dressing but also on catheter surfaces [
