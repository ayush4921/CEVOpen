<p>The capacity of magnetite/oleic acid nanoparticles functionalized with essential oils (
 <italic>Eugenia caryophyllata</italic> or 
 <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic>), obtained by a precipitation method under microwave condition, was able to inhibit the adherence and fungal biofilm development on functionalized catheter samples [
 <xref rid="B129-ijms-21-06633" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>,
 <xref rid="B160-ijms-21-06633" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>]. The chemical composition of both essential oils was different; whereas the main components of 
 <italic>E. caryophyllata</italic> were eugenol and α-caryophyllene, 
 <italic>R. officinalis</italic> oil was predominantly constituted by 1,8-cineole, α-pinene, camphor, and caryophyllene. The magnetite/oleic acid nanoparticles functionalized with 
 <italic>E. caryophyllata</italic> oil strongly inhibited the adherence of diverse 
 <italic>Candida</italic> clinical species (
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, 
 <italic>C. tropicalis</italic>, 
 <italic>C. krusei</italic>, and 
 <italic>C. glabrata</italic>) on catheter surface devices and, consequently, prevented the biofilm formation [
 <xref rid="B160-ijms-21-06633" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>]. 
 <italic>R. officinalis</italic> essential oil-coated nanoparticles also strongly inhibited the formation of biofilm of the clinical 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> strains on catheter surfaces observed through confocal laser scanning microscopy and viable cell counts [
