<p>Chelating agents, peptide antibiotics, lantibiotics, synthetic chemical compounds, and herbal active compounds are some examples of compounds that have been tested [

 <xref rid="B146-ijms-21-06633" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>]. Within the plant-origin compounds, EOs were proved to be able to prevent the formation of biofilms [

 <xref rid="B148-ijms-21-06633" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>,
 <xref rid="B149-ijms-21-06633" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>]. The ability of EOs to inhibit microbial adherence and further biofilm development is associated by their capacity to disrupt the quorum sensing system (QS) [

 <xref rid="B150-ijms-21-06633" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>,

 <xref rid="B153-ijms-21-06633" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>]. QS is a largely distributed cellâ€“cell communication process that has been identified not only in bacteria, but also in fungi, protozoa, and recently in bacteriophages [

 <xref rid="B155-ijms-21-06633" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>,

 <xref rid="B158-ijms-21-06633" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>]. An extensive number of physiological functions, including biofilm formation, the expression of virulence factors, conjugation, and competence are regulated by QS through a very finely tuned system of production, secretion, sensing, and DNA interaction of particular molecules that are designated by autoinducers [
 <xref rid="B159-ijms-21-06633" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>]. Since these natural compounds may act as an anti-biofilm, the conjugation of magnetite nanoparticles and natural compounds could be an interesting approach to combat the adherence and biofilm formation.
