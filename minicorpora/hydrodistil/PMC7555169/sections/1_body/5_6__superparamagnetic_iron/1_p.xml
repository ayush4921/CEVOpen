<p>The major concern in the infectious processes is the formation of biofilms by pathogenic microorganisms, which after adherence to surfaces exhibit increasing antibiotic resistance by around 1000-folds [

The utilization of medical devices, such as catheters, cardiac pacemakers, joint prosthesis, prosthetic heart valves, contact lenses, or implants, among other medical components, are responsible for at least 50% of the nosocomial infections [

At least two strategies can be adopted for avoiding the formation of biofilms, such as interference with bacterial adherence through direct blockage of their surface receptors or the utilization of compounds with anti-adherence properties.
