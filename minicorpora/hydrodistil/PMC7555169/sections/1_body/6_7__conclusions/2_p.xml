<p>The nanobiosystems tested using magnetite nanoparticles with different surfactants and associated with diverse essential oils were able not only to inhibit the adherence process but also the formation of biofilm in different microbial cells. Nevertheless, the utilization of essential oils with complex chemical composition, with dozens of compounds, makes it difficult to attrribute the antimicrobial and/or anti-adherence properties to some of those compounds. Moreover, the chemical composition of some essential oils was not provided. In addition, the diverse techniques used not only for the production of SPIONs, but also for their functionalization with diverse types of polymers without any apparent connection among them make it difficult to compare results and draw conclusions. In addition, there was a limitation of the majority of the studies, which was the use of a sole approach on the evaluation of the formation of biofilm that was mainly comprised by the determination of the microbial cells viability, and other aspects, such as the inhibition of exopolyssacharide production, inhibition of the cellâ€“cell communication, and virulence potential were not covered. It is recognized that all these features can have a tremendous impact on the infection process starting from the release of the surface colonization. Considering this, it is important that future studies include the exploitation of these aspects in order to have a more complete picture about the impact of the nanobiosystems on the associated physiological and virulence potential linked with biofilm.</p>
