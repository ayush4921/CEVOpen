<p>Diverse methods have been developed for producing magnetite nanoparticles with adequate size, shape, size distribution, surface, and magnetic properties. These methodologies almost always integrate functionalization with inorganic or organic molecules for stabilizating the magnetic nanoparticles as a magnetic colloidal suspension, which is particularly important if the medical application is envisaged. Essential oils have been used for the production of magnetite nanoparticles by the solâ€“gel method combined with autoignition, for modifying the surface magnetite nanoparticles for improving their stabilization and, particularly, to prevent the microbial growth.</p>
