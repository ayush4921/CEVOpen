<p>The extraction of essential oils is made by steam distillation or hydrodistillation with the exception of those extracted from the epicarp of 
 <italic>Citrus</italic> sp. Those procedures are time consuming; some compounds cannot be extracted, and other ones can undergo degradation reactions. Other classical and conventional methods have also been used for extracting the volatile fraction of aromatic plants such as solvent extraction, enfleurage, or hydrodiffusion, all of them with advantages and disadvantages. Other innovative extraction methods have been developed in order to minimize some disadvantages of those procedures, such as supercritical fluid extraction, subcritical fluid extraction, instantaneous controlled pressure drop process, microwave-assisted extractions, and ultrasound-assisted extraction; all of these methods have been reviewed recently [
