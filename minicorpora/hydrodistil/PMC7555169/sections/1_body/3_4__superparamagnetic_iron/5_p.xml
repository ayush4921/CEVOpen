<p>The essential oils obtained from 
 <italic>Syzygium aromaticum</italic> (clove) or 
 <italic>Cinnamomum</italic> sp. were used for producing magnetite particles by the sol–gel method combined with autoignition. In this procedure, nitrates are used as oxidants, and organic molecules (glycine, citric acid, or urea) are used as fuels but with the disadvantage of lacking antioxidant attributes. For this reason, Ben-Arfa et al. [
 <xref rid="B105-ijms-21-06633" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>] used cinnamom and clove oils as fuels and antioxidants for preserving the magnetic phases during subsequent heating of the production, which means that H

 <sub>2</sub> or argon gases were not required during the heat stabilization process. The samples were stabilized in air at 550 °C. The magnetic crystalline phase was mostly maghemite (γFe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub>) rather than magnetite (Fe
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>), but with identical magnetic properties. However, clove oil produced magnetic iron oxide particles more susceptible to undergoing thermally induced oxidation upon heating in air, and cinnamon possessed stronger anti-oxidative resistance [
