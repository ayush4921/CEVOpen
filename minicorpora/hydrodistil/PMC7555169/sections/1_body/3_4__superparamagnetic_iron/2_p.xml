<p>According to the review made by Mejri et al. [
 <xref rid="B95-ijms-21-06633" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>], microwave-assisted extractions include diverse techniques, such as microwave-assisted ionic liquids treatment followed by hydrodistillation, microwave-assisted solvent extraction, compressed air microwave distillation, vacuum microwave hydrodistillation, microwave-accelerated steam distillation, microwave hydrodiffusion, and gravity and solvent-free microwave extraction. Sometimes, it is possible to couple microwave distillation extraction with separation and identification techniques—for example, head space/solid phase microextraction (HS/SPME), as performed by Ye and Zheng [
 <xref rid="B96-ijms-21-06633" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. According to these authors, the extraction of the volatile fraction from dried aromatic plants with little moisture makes the extraction by microwave method complicated, owing to the little amount of water to absorb microwave energy. For this reason, the addition of magnetite materials, which are good absorbers of microwave radiation, was a way to solve the problem. The authors [
 <xref rid="B96-ijms-21-06633" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>] used amine-functionalized magnetite nanoparticles as a microwave absorption solid medium for extracting the volatile fraction of 
 <italic>Perilla frutescens</italic> (L.), which was followed by the identification and quantification of the compounds by HS/SPME. The same approach was also performed by Hashemi-Moghaddam [
 <xref rid="B97-ijms-21-06633" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>], who compared the microwave-assisted hydrodistillation using amine-functionalized magnetite nanoparticles with the classical hydrosdistillation method for extracting the essential oil of the hulls of 
 <italic>Pistacia vera</italic> L. The presence of amine-functionalized magnetite nanoparticles increased the oil yield, and more compounds were possible to be extracted, although the main components (α-pinene, α-terpinolene, myrcene, pinocarvone and camphene) did not alter.
