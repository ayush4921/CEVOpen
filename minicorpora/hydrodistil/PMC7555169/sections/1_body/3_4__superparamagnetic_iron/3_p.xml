<p>Beyond magnetite nanoparticles being used for extracting essential oils, essential oils can be added themselves to magnetite nanoparticles for enhancing the colloidal stability of the manufactured magnetic fluid sample through innovative extraction methods. These studies have been particularly developed by several authors [

 <italic>Copaifera Langsdorffii</italic> Desf.) oil, and the nanoparticles were obtained by coprecipitation in alkaline medium using a mixture of aqueous solution containing ferrous chloride and ferric chloride. They reported differences of MÃ¶ssbauer parameters for iron oxide nanoparticles as prepared and dispersed in copaiba oil. According to the authors, these differences could be attributed to the interactions of polar molecules of copaiba oil with Fe

 <italic>Carapa guianensis</italic> species) oils, always preserving the superparamagnetic behavior but with low saturation magnetization. However, it is important to stress that the chemical composition of both oils is particularly different. Whereas copaiba oil is an oleoresin mainly constituted by diterpenes and sesquiterpenes (volatile compounds), andiroba oil is mainly constituted by triacyglycerols composed by palmitic, oleic, and linoleic acids [
