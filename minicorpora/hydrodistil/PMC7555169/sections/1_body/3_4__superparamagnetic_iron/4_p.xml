<p>Still from Amazonian origin, the essential oil of

 <xref rid="B104-ijms-21-06633" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>] during the oleic acid-coated magnetic nanoparticles synthesis, by the thermal decomposition method; these authors studied whether the essential oil could constitute a second surface layer on the oleic acid-coated magnetic nanoparticles. The authors reported that the bilayer-coated magnetic nanoparticles with 
 <italic>C. cajucara</italic> oil were successfully produced, and their structural and morphological characterizations were performed through several techniques (X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and magnetic measurements). In addition, the authors also verified that the double-layer (oleic acid plus essential oil) coating of the magnetite nanoparticles noticeably quenches the particle–particle interaction originating a superparamagnetic-like behavior [

 <xref rid="B103-ijms-21-06633" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>] found, by thermogravimetric analysis, that the release of the essential oil occurred at approximately 50 °C, whereas the oleic acid was released only above approximately 380 °C. According to the authors [
 <xref rid="B103-ijms-21-06633" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>], the combination of the improved magnetic properties due to the double layer (oleic acid plus essential oil) coating of the magnetite nanoparticles which quenches the particle–particle interaction along with the detachment of essential oil at approximately 50 °C, keeping always stable the oleic acid coating, could render these double-layer magnetite nanoparticles candidates for site-delivering essential oils for targets to treat specific diseases.
