<p>All the synthesis methods described above take into consideration at least the aggregation issue and make use of additives to prevent this occurrence, such as citric or oleic acids. Nevertheless, in most of the cases, the methods used to prepare monodisperse nanoparticles with high crystallinity use hydrophobic surfactants to cover the particles surface, which makes them insoluble in water. A direct medical or biological application of such nanoparticles is not usually possible, and surface modification is required in order to obtain water-dispersible and chemically stable biocompatible magnetic materials. This surface modification may either be in situ or post synthetic. The most common strategies to fulfill these requirements involve the formation of coreâ€“shell structures where the surface of the magnetic nanoparticles is modified with surfactant micelles, bi-functional ligands, polymeric ligands, or silica (
