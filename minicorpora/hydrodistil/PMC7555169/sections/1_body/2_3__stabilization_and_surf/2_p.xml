<p>The iron atoms in the particle surface act as Lewis acids and therefore may coordinate with atoms of molecules that can donate a pair of electrons. In aqueous solutions, water coordinates with Fe easily dissociate, giving rise to a hydroxyl-functionalized surface. The hydroxyl groups are amphoteric, and the surface of the nanoparticles may be positive or negative depending on the pH of the solution.</p>
