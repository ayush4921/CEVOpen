<p>The stabilization of the magnetic nanoparticles as a magnetic colloidal suspension is a central issue that has to be considered in any subsequent application [

On the other hand, the chemical stability, namely that of the magnetic nanoparticles, has to be assured since the easily oxidation of the iron atoms in the magnetite structure causes changes in the magnetic properties. Finally, a surface coating of the nanoparticles with appropriate molecules becomes a necessity if a medical application is envisaged.
