<p>However, the magnetism of SPIONs can be hampered due to possible agglomeration and the risk of oxidation by air exposure; therefore, coating these nanoparticles is necessary, and this is usually carried out during and post synthesis with diverse non-degrading and nontoxic materials, including polymers such as starch and dextran, chitosan, carboxymethylcelulose, proteins (albumin), Arg–Gly–Asp (RGD) peptides, and lipids (fatty acids and their esters), and synthetic polymers, such as polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl alcohol, poly (acrylic acid) are only some examples [

These coatings not only stabilize the nanoparticles and assist in their dispersion but also may have a role in the disease therapy after functionalization with drugs for delivering them on the target. They may also improve the pharmacokinetic properties of drugs [

The utilization of polyethylene glycol is generally used for inhibiting phagocytosis by the reticuloendothelial system, improving the half-life of SPIONs in blood circulation and simultaneously promoting the enhanced permeability and retention effect in vivo [
