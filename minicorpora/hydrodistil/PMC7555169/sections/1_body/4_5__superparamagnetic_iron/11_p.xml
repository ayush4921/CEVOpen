In the same study, the authors found that magnetite and maghemite nanoparticles had the capacity for inhibiting the growth of 
 <italic>Staphyloccocus sureus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B139-ijms-21-06633" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>]. Magnetite nanoparticles were also able to inhibit the growth of planktonic cells of 
 <italic>Sacharomyces cerevisiae</italic> yeast but also the biofilm development on glass coverslips, as determined by a microtiter method and the biofilm architecture examined by inverted microscopy and confocal laser microscopy scanning [
 <xref rid="B140-ijms-21-06633" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>]. Later on, Darwish et al. [
 <xref rid="B141-ijms-21-06633" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>], after synthesizing magnetite nanoparticles by coprecipitation and coating them with three functional layers (oleic acid, polyethyleneimine, and polyethyleneimine-methyl cellulose), reported that they were able to prevent the growth of 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, particularly those coated with polyethyleneimine-methyl cellulose, and they also inhibited the formation of biofilms of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. All of them were effective for heat generation in alternating magnetic fields, whereby these nanoparticles had self-heating action and antibacterial effects.
