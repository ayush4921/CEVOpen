<p>SPIONs having sizes between 5 and 10 nm are better for treatments needing slow drug release; however, these sizes may contribute to a capillary blockage because they can be retained in the blood circulation for longer periods. In addition, these size ranges can easily enter into the cell nucleus, inducing DNA damage (Suciu et al., 2020). Nevertheless, there are reports considering that these very small sizes are a good characteristic of SPIONs, particularly for gene therapy [

In spite of those drawbacks, 5 to 15 nm SPIONs are presently approved and used for human medical applications, such as MRI (Suciu et al., 2020). Particles with sizes higher than 200 nm become concentrated in the spleen or are taken up by phagocytic cells, leading to low plasma concentrations (Nguyen et al., 2016).
