<p>Polyvinylpyrrolidone-coated SPIONs, at concentrations ranging from 10 to 100 μg/mL, and for up to three days, promoted the proliferation of human breast cancer BT-474 cell line. This behavior was not observed when the concentration of SPIONs were higher than 200 μg/mL or when the coating was dextran. For higher concentrations, polyvinylpyrrolidone-coated SPIONs were toxic to these cancer cells, as desired, and dextran-coated SPIONs, at concentrations lower than 200 μg/mL, were toxic for the same cancer lines after 48 h of exposition [
