<p>Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) measures and maps the concentration of SPIONs over a spatial position. In magnetic particle spectroscopy (MPS), sinusoidal magnetic fields are applied to periodically magnetize SPIONs; then, the dynamic magnetic responses of SPIONs, which contain unique higher odd harmonics, are harvested by a pair of pick-up coils [

The H1N1 nucleoprotein, which hosts multiple different epitopes for these IgG polyclonal antibodies, are able to cross-link between SPIONs (IgG from the particle surface) and H1N1 nucleoproteins, forming different degrees of SPIONs clusters, depending on the number/concentration of H1N1 nucleoprotein molecules in the magnetic nanoparticle ferrofluid. When these ferrofluid samples are subjected to external oscillating magnetic fields, significant changes in the macroscopic magnetic responses of magnetic nanoparticles occur, which are detected by the MPS system. According to the authors (Wu et al., 2020), this approach was able to detect concentrations in the range of hundreds of pmole of H1N1 nucleoprotein. The method was also rapid (results provided in 10 s), needing only non-technicians with minimum technical training. This method shows some importance to be improved for several reasons; for example, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), influenza viruses, responsible for seasonal epidemics of acute respiratory illness known as influenza or flu, are responsible for 250,000 to 500,000 deaths annually [

In this review article, the authors consider that this approach must be explored for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, since current diagnostic tests are based on real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) that requires 48 h for having a result, expensive equipment, and trained technicians, and there have been many global deaths. At the end of August 2020, 8 months after the first notifications of atypical pneumonia in the Hospital of Wuhan, China, more than 840,000 of deaths were registered due to the SARS-CoV-2 (
