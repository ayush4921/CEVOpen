<p>The functionalization of the magnetite nanoparticles with antibiotics has been performed with the objective of increasing the molecule activity. For example, functionalized magnetite nanostructures with amoxicilline showed activity against both the Gram-positive 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and the Gram-negative 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, reducing significantly the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the antibiotic. This result may mean that the therapeutic dose of amoxicillin can be reduced if under functionalized magnetite nanostructures [

 <xref rid="B126-ijms-21-06633" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>] also reported a prolonged anti-biofilm activity against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> in the presence of magnetite nanoparticles stabilized by sodium lauryl sulfate and coated with cefotaxime and cefrom antibiotics.
