<p>Cell surfaces generally have a negatively charged outer layer; therefore, positively charged particles tend to attach to the cell surfaces, which may become toxic to these cells. Positively charged polyethyleneimine–Fe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub>–NPs (PEI-NPs) were toxic in utero of mice exposed to these nanoparticles, whereas negatively charged poly(acrylic acid)–Fe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub>–NPs (PAA-NPs) only induced mild toxicity [
