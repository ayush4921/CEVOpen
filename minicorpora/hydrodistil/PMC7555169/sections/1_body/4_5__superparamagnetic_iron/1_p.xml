 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles are the mostly utilized iron oxide nanoparticles because of their superparamagnetism, biocompatibility, and lower toxicity [

The superparamagnetic characteristic of these nanoparticles means that in the absence of an external magnetic field, they lose magnetic momentum, becoming non-magnetic, but a mean magnetic momentum appears if an external field is applied. These properties make these superparamagnetic nanoparticles interesting for carrying drugs to the specific target sites at relative high levels because they are guided to those target sites through an external magnetic field or receptor targeting. This behavior reduces substantially the adverse and toxic effects in other parts of the organism [
