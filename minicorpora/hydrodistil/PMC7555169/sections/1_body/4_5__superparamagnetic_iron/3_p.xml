<p>It is predicted that most nanoparticles can accumulate much better within cancer cells, due to their poorer lymphatic drainage, compared to normal cells, and therefore, there is an enhanced permeability and retention effect [

However, there is always heterogeneous behavior, since tumors are heterogeneous by nature (diverse tumor types of the same origin, tumors at different locations in the same patient, and even at different stages of the same tumor during its development). In addition, within a tumor, there are variations in the thickness and density of the extracellular matrix, irregular blood flow distribution, and unequal vessel permeability [
