<p>Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles are constituted by small (&lt;10 nm) synthetic Î³Fe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> (maghemite) or Fe
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> (magnetite) particles. They can be coated by organic or inorganic compounds. They also do not possess magnetic moments in the absence of an external magnetic field; nevertheless, when they are submitted to an external magnetic field, they become magnetized. Due to these superparamagnetic properties of nanoparticles, they do not agglomerate and can travel through blood vessels, being manipulated toward a specific body area and/or a target through an external stimulus [

Therefore, the superparamagnetic properties of iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs), along with the ability to control their biocompatibility and reduce toxicity, has led to their numerous biomedical applications: drug delivery, hyperthermia for cancer therapy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic particle imaging, magnetic biosensor systems, separation immunoassays, parasite diagnostic assays, nanobridges substances for surgery and wound healing, and cell labeling [
