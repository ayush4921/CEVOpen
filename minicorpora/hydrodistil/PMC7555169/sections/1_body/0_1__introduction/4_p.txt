0: However, those SPIONs must present chemical and colloidal stability, minimum or absent nonspecific interactions, desired pharmacokinetics, an increased efficiency of internalization by target cells, extended blood circulation time, and slow clearance by the reticuloendothelial system, among other properties for being used in treatment and diagnosis.
1: In fact, the use of these materials can lead to some toxicity issues that need to be considered, being the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which causes oxidative stress-mediated responses, which are the main cause of toxicity [ 24, 25].
2: It is accepted that the production of those ROS results from the leaching of iron ions from the surface or the core of the nanoparticle due to enzymatic activity.
3: The accumulation in different tissues of the body and the characteristics of surface coating of the nanoparticle may also play an important role in the leaching and/or accumulation of iron ions that subsequently could lead to homeostasis imbalance and aberrant cellular responses such as oxidative stress, cytotoxicity, epigenetic events, DNA damages, and inflammatory processes [ 25].
4: Therefore, a proper surface coating/functionalization of these nanoparticles is of paramount importance to achieve these attributes [ 26, 27].
