Essential oils constituted by dozens or hundreds of compounds can easily undergo degradation reactions (isomerization, polymerization, oxidation, and rearrangements) in the presence of light, oxygen, or moderately high temperatures, leading to the loss or reduction of oil quality. In addition, the intense flavor and aroma may render it difficult to use the essential oils in diverse applications. For these reasons, scientists have developed ways to hide these undesirable characteristics of essential oils and simultaneously enhance their biological properties. Nanotechnology has explored formulations for better using essential oils in diverse fields from the agri-food industry to the pharmaceutical industry [
