0: Infections caused by microorganisms are a concern for human health.
1: Generally, antibiotics are used for the treatment of bacterial infections, but antibiotic resistance arises and spreads rapidly due to multifactorial causes, such as the natural process of horizontal transference of genes (conjugation, transformation, and transduction) facilitating the spread of antibiotic resistance that can cross several bacterial species mostly associated to an inappropriate use of antibiotics [ 1].
2: Virulence factors (such as toxins, enzymes, structural elements, such as flagella, pilli, capsule, etc.)
3: promote disease by either damaging the host or tricking the host immune system, and they need to be neutralized or suppressed for combating bacterial pathogenicity.
4: This is another way to combat those microorganisms with much less possibility to develop bacterial resistance to antibiotics [ 2].
