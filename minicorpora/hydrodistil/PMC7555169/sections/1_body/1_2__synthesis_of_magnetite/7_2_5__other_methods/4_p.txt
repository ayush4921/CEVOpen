0: Spray pyrolysis and related methods, examples of aerosol technologies for the synthesis of magnetic nanoparticles, are continuous chemical processes that allow a high rate of production.
1: Spray pyrolysis consists in the spraying of a solution of ferric salts and a reducing agent in organic solvent into a series of reactors, where the aerosol solute condenses, the solvent evaporates, and a pyrolysis reaction takes place (usually at temperatures above 500 C).
2: The resulting dried residue consists of particles whose size depends upon the initial size and size distribution of the original droplets [ 28, 36].
3: This particular method shows many advantages in the synthesis of pure magnetic nanoparticles and magnetic nanoparticles-containing composites as it is a continous flow process, where the nanoparticles are synthetised in a sigle step with lower costs than other processes.
4: The method is easy to implement and exhibits a high chemical flexibility that allows the preparation of particles of different materials with different compositions [ 80, 81, 82].
5: Several variations of this method have been described in recent years.
6: Examples of these are the use of ultrasounds for dispersing the precursor solution into droplets (ultrasound spray pyrolysis), as reported by Peter Majeric et al.
7: [ 83] in the preparation of maghemite nanoparticles (260390 nm) decorated with Au nanoparticles (2467 nm), the spraying of aqueous metal solutions directly into a flame (flame spray pyrolysis) used by Reto Strobel and Sotiris E. Pratsinis [ 84] to prepare maghemite, magnetite, and wustite nanoparticles, or the use of a laser beam to promote the pyrolysis of iron precursors as repoted by Sabino Veintemillas-Verdaguer et al.
