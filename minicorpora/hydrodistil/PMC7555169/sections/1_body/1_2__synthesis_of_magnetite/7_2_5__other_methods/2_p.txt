0: The polyol method comprises a polyol as solvent where an iron precursor is suspended.
1: The mixture is stirred and heated at a given temperature that is limited by the boiling point of the polyol used.
2: When compared with the solgel method, this approach makes use of a reduction reaction of the iron precursor instead of the oxidation that occurs in the solgel process.
3: This is the reason why this method is also called an inversed solgel method.
4: Polyols, such as ethyleneglycol or triethylene glycol, may dissolve inorganic compounds due to their high dielectric constants and may offer a wide range of working temperatures due to the relatively high boiling points.
5: In this process, polyols also serve as reducing agents and stabilizers that prevent particle aggregation [ 28, 36].
