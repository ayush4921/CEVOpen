<p>Spray pyrolysis and related methods, examples of aerosol technologies for the synthesis of magnetic nanoparticles, are continuous chemical processes that allow a high rate of production. Spray pyrolysis consists in the spraying of a solution of ferric salts and a reducing agent in organic solvent into a series of reactors, where the aerosol solute condenses, the solvent evaporates, and a pyrolysis reaction takes place (usually at temperatures above 500 °C). The resulting dried residue consists of particles whose size depends upon the initial size and size distribution of the original droplets [

 <xref rid="B36-ijms-21-06633" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This particular method shows many advantages in the synthesis of pure magnetic nanoparticles and magnetic nanoparticles-containing composites as it is a continous flow process, where the nanoparticles are synthetised in a sigle step with lower costs than other processes. The method is easy to implement and exhibits a high chemical flexibility that allows the preparation of particles of different materials with different compositions [
