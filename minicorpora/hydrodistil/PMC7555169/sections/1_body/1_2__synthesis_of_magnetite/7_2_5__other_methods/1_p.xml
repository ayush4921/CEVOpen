<p>Numerous other methods have been used for the preparation of magnetic nanoparticles or magnetic nanoparticles containing composites; these include polyol synthesis, microwave-assisted synthesis, sonolysis, flow injection synthesis, electrochemical methods, aerosol/vapor methods, and biosynthesis. Some of these methods can be understood as improvements of one of the above-described methods. For example, heating under microwave radiation can significantly reduce processing time and energy cost due to the very fast heating of the synthesis mixture resulting from the strong agitation of the reorientation of the molecules in phase with the electrical field excitation [

 <xref rid="B75-ijms-21-06633" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] have used microwave radiation (80 °C and 8–15 min irradiation time) to promote the formation of magnetite by coprecipitation. Under this procedure, the authors obtained both naked and surface-modified magnetite with oleic and mercaptopropionic acids and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide. Very high-temperature hot spots can be generated by the use of ultrasound. These hot spots result from the rapid collapse of ultrasonic-generated cavities and may be used to prepare magnetic nanoparticle by the decomposition of iron precursors as shown by Abu Mukh-Qasem [
