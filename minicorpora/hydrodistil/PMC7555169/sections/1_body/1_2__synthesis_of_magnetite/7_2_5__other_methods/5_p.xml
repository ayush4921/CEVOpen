<p>All the methods described above present advantages and drawbacks in terms of the simplicity and control of the shape, size, and size distribution of the nanoparticles. When choosing a synthesis method, the requirements of final application in terms of amount, size, shape, size distribution, surface properties, and magnetic properties of the nanoparticles have to be considered. 
 <xref rid="ijms-21-06633-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> summarizes some general trends observed in representative methods.
