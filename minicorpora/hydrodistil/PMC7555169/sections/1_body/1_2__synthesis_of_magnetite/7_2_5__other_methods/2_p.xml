<p>The polyol method comprises a polyol as solvent where an iron precursor is suspended. The mixture is stirred and heated at a given temperature that is limited by the boiling point of the polyol used. When compared with the sol–gel method, this approach makes use of a reduction reaction of the iron precursor instead of the oxidation that occurs in the sol–gel process. This is the reason why this method is also called an inversed sol–gel method. Polyols, such as ethyleneglycol or triethylene glycol, may dissolve inorganic compounds due to their high dielectric constants and may offer a wide range of working temperatures due to the relatively high boiling points. In this process, polyols also serve as reducing agents and stabilizers that prevent particle aggregation [
