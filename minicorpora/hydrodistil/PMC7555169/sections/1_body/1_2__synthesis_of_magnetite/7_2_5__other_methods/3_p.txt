0: Flow injection methods consist of the continuous or segmented mixing of reagents under a laminar flow regime in a capillary reactor.
1: These methods are in fact modified coprecipitation methods but exhibit properties such as high reproducibility, high mixing homogeneity, and an opportunity for a precise external control of the process [ 28, 36].
2: Electrochemical methods may also present some advantages over other synthesis methods, namely the high purity of the product and the possibility of controlling the particle size by the adjustment of the current or potential applied to the system [ 78, 79].
