<p>Different strategies for the synthesis of magnetic nanoparticles, involving high temperature, have also been successfully developed. These high-temperature methods that include hydrothermal, solvothermal, and thermal decomposition usually require the synthesis mixture to be placed into a sealed autoclave and heated at temperatures well above the boiling point of the solvent and sometimes even at temperatures above its critical temperature. Variations of this method may include the use of a continuous system involving a counter-current flow reactor [
