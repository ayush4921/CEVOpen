<p>The scope of hydrothermal and solvothermal approaches has been expanded; one the main targets today is the preparation of magnetic nanoparticles with unusual morphologies. The works, among many others, of Wan et al. [

 <xref rid="B57-ijms-21-06633" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] are examples of the potential exhibited by these methods, where mesoporous nanocrystals, particle aggregates with a flower-shape structure, and well-faceted single crystals were obtained, respectively.
