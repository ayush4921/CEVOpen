<p>Magnetic nanoparticles can be prepared in different ways involving the oxidation, reduction, or coprecipitation of iron precursors. Ge and co-workers [
 <xref rid="B53-ijms-21-06633" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] have shown that magnetite nanoparticles with different particle sizes can be prepared from FeCl
 <sub>2</sub> and ammonia through a hydrothermal or solvothermal treatment, changing the reaction conditions. Here, air is used before and during the thermal treatment to promote the oxidation of Fe(II) to Fe(III). Tian et al. [
 <xref rid="B54-ijms-21-06633" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] used Fe(acac)
 <sub>3</sub> (iron(III) (acethylacetonate)) as an iron source, 
 <italic>n</italic>-octylamine as a reductant, and 
 <italic>n</italic>-octanol as a solvent to prepare ultrasmall monodisperse magnetite nanoparticles. By varying the composition of the synthesis mixture, namely the volumes of 
 <italic>n</italic>-octanol and 
 <italic>n</italic>-octylamine, monodisperse nanoparticles with sizes of 1, 4, 5, and 6 nm could be obtained. A coprecipitation of FeCl
 <sub>2</sub> and FeCl
 <sub>3</sub> at 70 °C followed by a hydrothermal treatment at 250 °C was the method followed by T.G. Daou et al. [
 <xref rid="B55-ijms-21-06633" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] to prepare magnetite nanoparticles with an average size of 39 nm with good monodispersivity. To prevent oxidation, argon was used during the whole process.
