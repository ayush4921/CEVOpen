<p>A usual procedure involves the preparation of an ironâ€“oleate complex that is subsequently heated at high temperature in the presence of oleic acid in a high-boiling point solvent as described by Park [

 <xref rid="B60-ijms-21-06633" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. In this approach, the operational temperature depends on the choice of the solvent. By a similar procedure Patsula [

 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> nanoparticles via the thermal decomposition of a Fe(III)-glucuronate complex synthetized in a previous step. Fe(acac)
 <sub>3</sub> is another widely used iron precursor that allows a simple implementation of the method [
