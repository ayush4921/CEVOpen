<p>The thermal decomposition of iron precursors can also be accomplished in solventless conditions as shown by Asuha et al. [

 <xref rid="B68-ijms-21-06633" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Using this procedure, the size of the nanocrystals is dependent on the temperature of decomposition. Urea, one of the products of the thermal decomposition of the initial complex, seems to play a key role in the formation of magnetite by the partial reduction of the F
 <sup>3+</sup> ions.
