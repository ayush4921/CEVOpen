<p>High-temperature methods are well suited for the control of the particle size, since the crystal growth is mainly achieved at the high-temperature stage. Consequently, the crystal growth can be easily stopped by a quick decrease of the reaction temperature. Other parameters, such as the Fe/oleic acid ratio, the solvent used, and the addition of sodium oleate have also a direct influence on the particle shape and particle size [
