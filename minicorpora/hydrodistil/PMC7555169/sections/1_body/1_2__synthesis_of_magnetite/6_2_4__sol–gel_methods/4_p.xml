<p>Less conventional sol–gel procedures were also adopted by different authors to prepare magnetic nanoparticles. For instance, Lemine et al. [
 <xref rid="B73-ijms-21-06633" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] synthetized magnetite nanoparticles with an average size around 8 nm using the modified sol–gel method under supercritical conditions of ethyl alcohol, and Sciancalepore et al. [
 <xref rid="B74-ijms-21-06633" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] prepared monocrystalline magnetite particles with a size ranging from 4 to 8 nm using a microwave-assisted non-hydrolitic sol–gel synthesis route.
