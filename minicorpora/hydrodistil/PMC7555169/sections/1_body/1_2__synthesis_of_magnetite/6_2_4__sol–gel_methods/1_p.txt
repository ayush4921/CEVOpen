0: The solgel method, another class of synthesis procedures, is based on the hydrolysis and condensation reactions of metallic precursors in solution, in such conditions where a sol of nanometric particles is achieved.
1: Further condensation and polymerization reactions give rise to a three-dimensional network of either discrete particles or network polymers, which are usually known as wet gel.
2: Usually, these reactions are performed at low temperature; thus, further treatments at higher temperature may be needed to obtain the final structure.
