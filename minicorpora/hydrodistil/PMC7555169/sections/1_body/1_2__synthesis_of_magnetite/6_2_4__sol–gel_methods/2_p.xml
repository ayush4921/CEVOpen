<p>Magnetite nanoparticles have been prepared though this approach and, in a similar way to that found for other type of nanoparticles, the structure and properties of the gel are influenced by the solvent, temperature, nature, concentration of the salt precursors employed, pH, and agitation [

The most used precursors for the synthesis of magnetic nanoparticles are iron alkoxides and iron salts (such as chlorides, nitrates, and acetates), which undergo various forms of hydrolysis and polycondensation reactions in acidic or alkaline conditions.
