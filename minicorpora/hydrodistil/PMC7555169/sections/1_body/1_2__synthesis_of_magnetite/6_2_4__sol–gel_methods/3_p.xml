<p>Through this method, it is possible to obtain materials with a predetermined structure according to the experimental conditions, with good control of the particle size and homogeneity of the reaction products [

The possibility to embed molecules, which maintain their stability and properties within the sol–gel matrix, makes this method particularly suited for the preparation of core–shell nanoparticles and organic–inorganic composites involving magnetic oxides. For instance, Hasanpour et al. [
 <xref rid="B70-ijms-21-06633" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] prepared magnetite nanoparticles with an average size of 10 nm starting from ferric nitrate nonahydrate and ethylene glycol. The sol was obtained at 40 °C, under stirring for 2 h, and the gel was obtained at 80 °C; a subsequent drying was performed at 150 °C for 20 h, and the annealing was done at different temperatures (350–650 °C) for a further 2 h. The annealing temperature plays an important role in the process, because it induces different types of crystallinity, size, and also magnetic properties of the particles. The authors have shown that this synthesis route can be also used for the “one-pot synthesis” of Fe

 <sub>4</sub>/ZnO nanocomposite materials. FexOy–SiO
 <sub>2</sub> composites have been widely prepared by procedures that involve a sol–gel step as shown by Raileanu et al. [

 <sub>2</sub> nanoparticles by a two-step method: Fe
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> nanoparticles were prepared by a solvothermal method, and in the second step, the Fe
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> nanoparticles were coated with SiO
 <sub>2</sub> formed through the hydrolyzation of tetraethyl orthosilicate.
