0: Less conventional solgel procedures were also adopted by different authors to prepare magnetic nanoparticles.
1: For instance, Lemine et al.
2: [ 73] synthetized magnetite nanoparticles with an average size around 8 nm using the modified solgel method under supercritical conditions of ethyl alcohol, and Sciancalepore et al.
3: [ 74] prepared monocrystalline magnetite particles with a size ranging from 4 to 8 nm using a microwave-assisted non-hydrolitic solgel synthesis route.
