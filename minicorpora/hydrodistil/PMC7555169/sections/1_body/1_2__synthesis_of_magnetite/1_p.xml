<p>Different methods have been developed along the past decades aiming at the preparation of magnetite nanoparticles. Nevertheless, there is still room for improvement because if the synthesis of a pure magnetite phase is relatively easy to perform, obtaining magnetite nanoparticles with a desired particle size and acceptable size distribution is a more challenging task. Detailed reviews that include a variety of synthesis strategies of these materials can be found in the literature [
