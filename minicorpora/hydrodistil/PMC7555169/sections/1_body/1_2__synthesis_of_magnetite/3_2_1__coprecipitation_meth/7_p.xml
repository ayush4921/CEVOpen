<p>Since the size and size distribution of the nanoparticles are of paramount importance in the majority of applications, some strategies have been developed in order to achieve, at least, a partial control over these parameters. The key idea is to cover the nanoparticles with an organic moiety (polymeric or quelating organic anions) during the synthesis process in order to prevent further growth.</p>
