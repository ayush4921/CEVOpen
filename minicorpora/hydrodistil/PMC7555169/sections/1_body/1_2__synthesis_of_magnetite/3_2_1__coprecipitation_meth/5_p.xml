<p>Magnetite does not show a high stability in aqueous environments and may be subjected to oxidation to maghemite (Î³Fe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub>) in the presence of oxygen. Thus, in order to prevent the oxidation of Fe(II) ions, it is usual to carry out the synthesis process under an inert gas.
