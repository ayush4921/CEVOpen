<p>Different variations of the classical coprecipitation method have been described in the literature [
 <xref rid="B36-ijms-21-06633" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Among those, the use of Na
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>3</sub> seems to favor the reaction control in what concerns the oxidation of ferrous ions, avoiding the use of a protective gas (usually nitrogen). In this case, the ferrous ions are not added to the synthesis mixture but instead are generated in situ by the partial reduction of ferric ions with Na
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>3</sub> [
 <xref rid="B38-ijms-21-06633" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The formation of complexes of ferric ions with SO
 <sub>3</sub>
