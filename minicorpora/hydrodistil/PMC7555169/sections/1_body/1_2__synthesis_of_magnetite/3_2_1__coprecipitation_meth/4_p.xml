<p>The formation of the nanoparticles follows the usual mechanism of the nucleation and growth of crystals. In this case, a large number of nuclei are formed simultaneously from the homogeneous solution in a process called “burst nucleation” as the species reach a critical supersaturation, which is followed by a stage where a slow growth of the crystals occurs. In order to control the particle size distribution, the nuclei formation must be avoided during this second stage of crystal growth according to the LaMer model [
