<p>The synthesis procedure involving water–oil emulsions is another method that has been used to prepare magnetite nanoparticles for decades. A particularly interesting type of emulsion is the water-in-oil microemulsion (reverse microemulsion), where the aqueous phase is dispersed as microdroplets (typically 1–50 nm in diameter) in a non-polar phase. In this method, the aqueous droplets are stabilized by a thin layer of a surfactant. Each stabilized droplet is a confined environment that can impose kinetic and thermodynamic constraints to chemical reactions involved in the nanoparticles formation and can thus act as a nanoreactor. The size of the reverse micelles can be controlled by varying the water/surfactant ratio, and consequently, this offers a way to control the size and size distribution of the synthetized magnetite nanoparticles. Under stirring, the reverse micelles continuously collide, giving rise to fusions and breakups that make the different precursors present in individual droplets eventually mix and initiate the reaction [

After completion of the reaction, the product may be recovered after adding different solvents, such as methanol or acetone, in order to break up the micelles. A large variety of surfactants such as cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (NaDBS), Igepal CO-520, Triton-X 100 sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS), polyoxyethylene (Brij30), dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (DTAB), dodecyltriethylammonium bromide (DEAB), dodecyltributylammonium bromide (DBAB), dimethylene-1,2-
