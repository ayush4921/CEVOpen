<p>The method has been shown to be adequate to prepare both pure magnetite nanoparticles and magnetite core–shell structures with different organic and inorganic compounds. It was first described for the synthesis of magnetite sols by Gobe et al. [
 <xref rid="B41-ijms-21-06633" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] that used microemulsions of water/isooctane and water/cyclohexane with Aerosol OT (dioctyl sulfosuccinate) and hexaoxy–ethylene nonylphenyl ether as surfactants. Since then, a large diversity of nanoparticles has been prepared using the reverse micelles method ranging from metallic or intermetallic materials to quaternary metal oxides.
