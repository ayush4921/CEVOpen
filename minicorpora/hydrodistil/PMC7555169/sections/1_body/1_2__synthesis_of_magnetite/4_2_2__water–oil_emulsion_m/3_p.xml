<p>In what concerns the synthesis of magnetite nanoparticles, this approach has several advantages such as the low temperature of operation, usually 20–70 °C; the reaction time, which typically is in the range of minutes to just a few hours; the good control of the shape and size of the particles; and a narrow size distribution. Several reports have shown the versatility of the microemulsion method, either alone or included into a more complex procedure. For instance, Vidal-Vidal et al. [
 <xref rid="B44-ijms-21-06633" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] reported the preparation of monodispersed magnetic nanoparticles coated with oleylamine obtained in a water-in-oil emulsion (cyclohexane/Brij-97/aqueous phase). Shen et al. [
