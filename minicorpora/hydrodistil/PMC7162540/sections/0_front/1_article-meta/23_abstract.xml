  <title>Background</title>
  <p>Essential oils may represent an alternative strategy for controlling scabies, a neglected tropical disease caused by the infestation of mite from the species 
   <italic>Sarcoptes scabiei</italic>. Lemongrass (
   <italic>Cymbopogen citratus</italic>) oil is reported to possess pharmacological properties including antiparasitc, antioxidant, antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory. The aim of the present study was to assess the potential efficacy of lemongrass oil against the mites and eggs of 
   <italic>Sarcoptes scabiei</italic>.

  <title>Methodology/Principal findings</title>
  <p>Mass spectrometry analysis confirmed that the main component presented in lemongrass oil was citral. Lemongrass oil at concentrations of 10% and 5% killed all 
   <italic>Sarcoptes</italic> mites within 10 and 25 min, respectively. The median lethal concentration value was 1.37%, 1.08%, 0.91%, 0.64%, and 0.48% at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h, respectively. Lemongrass oil at all concentrations (10%, 5%, 1%, 0.5%, 0.1%) was able to significantly decrease the hatching rate of 
   <italic>Sarcoptes</italic> eggs.

  <title>Conclusions/Significance</title>
  <p>Lemongrass oil should be considered as a promising miticidal and ovicidal agent for scabies control.</p>
