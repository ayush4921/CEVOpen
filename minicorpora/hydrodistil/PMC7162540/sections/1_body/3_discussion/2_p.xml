<p>Paraffin oil is considered to be a satisfactory solvent for dissolving essential oils in bioassay. In the current study, all 
 <italic>Sarcoptes</italic> mites were live after 24 h immersed in paraffin oil and all eggs hatched when only treated with paraffin oil. In a study of monoterpenes against ear mite (
 <italic>Otodectes cynotis</italic>), Olivier [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008225.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] tested three solvents (acetone, paraffin oil and 20% glycerol), demonstrating that paraffin oil not only exhibited good solubilization capability, good viscosity and volatility properties, but also induced the longest mean survival time of mites.
