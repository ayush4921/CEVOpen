<p>Currently, topical permethrin and oral ivermectin are the two most commonly used treatments for scabies [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008225.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, both drugs are only available for scabies in a limited number of countries over the world, and both drugs are expensive [

In conjunction with education about its limitations and possible side effects, lemongrass oil, which extracted from a plant widely grown in tropical regions, should be considered a promising miticide against scabies, considering that it possesses significant activity against both 
 <italic>Sarcoptes</italic> mites and eggs. Further studies should consider testing the efficacy of isolated main components against 
 <italic>Sarcoptes</italic> mites and eggs to identify active compounds. The mechanism of action of active compounds is also worth investigating. Moreover, 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies are necessary to confirm the efficacy and safety of lemongrass oil which could accelerate its use in scabies management.
