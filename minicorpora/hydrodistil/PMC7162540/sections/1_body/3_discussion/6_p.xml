<p>A limitation is that all the tests in the present study were performed using 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>scabies</italic> var. 
 <italic>cuniculi</italic> instead of var. 
 <italic>hominis</italic>. However, obtaining enough mites from patients with common scabies to perform

 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>scabiei</italic> infests different mammalian hosts in 17 families and 7 orders including humans and rabbits. Mites from different hosts may exhibit little differences regarding their morphology and host preference but they share the same biology [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008225.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. From previous studies, it can be postulated that there was no difference in the survival rate of mites from rabbits and humans under the condition tested.
