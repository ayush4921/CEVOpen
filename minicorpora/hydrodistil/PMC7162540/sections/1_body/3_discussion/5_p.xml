<p>When used as a topical treatment, potential side effects of essential oils should also be considered. A review on patch tests demonstrated that 1.8% of the participants had positive allergic reactions to 2% of lemongrass oil [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008225.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), no study has clearly showed which compounds are responsible for the allergic reactions. Compounds such as geraniol and citronellol have been identified as potential skin sensitizers. However, both geraniol and citronellol were considered as less important or weak sensitizer in terms of frequency of sensitization [

According to the results of our study, lemongrass oil at the concentration of 5% is effective against both mites and eggs. A comprehensive review showed that the threshold for citral (a major component accounting for 69.37% in the present study) to induce dermal sensitization in human is 1.4 mg/cm
