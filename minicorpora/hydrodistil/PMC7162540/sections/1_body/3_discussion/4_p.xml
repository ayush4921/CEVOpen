<p>There was a significant decrease in hatching rate of 
 <italic>Sarcoptes</italic> eggs exposed to all concentrations of lemongrass oil. The ovicidal activity of different essential oils has been demonstrated against the eggs of head lice (
 <italic>Pediculus humanus capitis</italic>) [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008225.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and poultry red mite (
 <italic>Dermanyssus gallinae</italic>) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008225.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. A study evaluated the ovicidal activity of lemongrass oil against 
 <italic>Haemonchus contortus</italic> (a nematode parasite of ruminants) eggs, resulting in a EC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.14 mg/mL [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008225.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. To the authorsâ€™ knowledge, the present study is the first to report the investigation of the ovicidal activity of an essential oil against 
 <italic>Sarcoptes</italic> eggs. Since few available miticides possess ovicidal efficacy against 
 <italic>Sarcoptes</italic> mites [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008225.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], lemongrass oil could be particularly beneficial in the control of scabies as it would reduce the need for multiple treatments to kill newly hatched larvae.
