<p>The chemical profile of lemongrass oil analysis in this study was comparable with that described previously from plants collected in Cameroon [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008225.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The results revealed a large proportion of citral, which is a natural mixture of two isomeric aldehydes, geranial (trans-citral, citral A) and neral (cis-citral, citral B) [

 <italic>Leishmania amazonensis</italic> [

 <italic>Tetranycchus urticae</italic>, the two-spotted spider mite, compared to 33 commercial essential oils and compounds [
