0: Control of scabies is predominantly performed by the use of synthetic miticides with topical agents (e.g.
1: permethrin, benzyl benzoate, malathion and crotamiton) and oral ivermectin.
2: Unfortunately, most chemical miticides are suboptimal, as they are either associated with moderate to severe side effects and/or require multiple treatments due to limited ovicidal activity [ 4, 5].
3: In addition, resistance to the mostly used miticides has emerged [ 6].
4: Novel drug with new modes of action could slow down the emergence of resistance if used alternated with existing drugs [ 7].
5: Studies have shown that essential oils such as clove, tea tree and palmorosa are effective against the motile stages of  Sarcoptes mites [ 8 10].
6: As a topical therapy, 5% tea tree oil has been proposed for scabies treatment in Australia [ 11].
7: However, none of these studies have tested the ovicidal activity of these oils.
