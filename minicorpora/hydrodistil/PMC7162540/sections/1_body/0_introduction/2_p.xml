<p>Control of scabies is predominantly performed by the use of synthetic miticides with topical agents (e.g. permethrin, benzyl benzoate, malathion and crotamiton) and oral ivermectin. Unfortunately, most chemical miticides are suboptimal, as they are either associated with moderate to severe side effects and/or require multiple treatments due to limited ovicidal activity [
