 <italic>Cymbopogon citratus</italic> (DC.) Stapf 1906, is a plant widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions. The essential oil from 
 <italic>C. citratus</italic> is known as lemongrass oil, with citral as the major component [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008225.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Lemongrass oil is reported to possess a variety of pharmacological properties including antiparasitic [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008225.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], antioxidant [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008225.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], antimicrobial [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008225.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and anti-inflammatory [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008225.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Lemongrass oil was also reported to show miticididal effect against a plant pathogen (
 <italic>Tetranycchus urticae</italic>) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008225.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and house dust mites [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008225.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, its activity against 
 <italic>S. scabiei</italic> has not been described so far. In this study, we extracted and analyzed the essential oil of 
 <italic>Cymbopogon citratus</italic> collected in Southern China and further assessed its miticidal and ovicidal efficacy against 
 <italic>S. scabiei</italic> from rabbits.
