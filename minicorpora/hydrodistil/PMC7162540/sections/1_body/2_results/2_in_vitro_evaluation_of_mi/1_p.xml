<p>Compared to paraffin oil (negative control), lemongrass oil showed a significant effect against 
 <italic>Sarcoptes</italic> mites, in a dose- and time-dependent manner. At the concentration of 10% and 5%, lemongrass oil killed all the mites within 10 and 25 min, respectively. The miticidal efficacy was significantly better than the positive control of 25% benzyl benzoate which with a mean mortality rate of 66 min. The mean mortalities at 24 h of 1%, 0.5% and 0.1% were 100%, 48.3% and 12%, respectively (

 <sub>50</sub> value of lemongrass oil at 1 h, 3 h, 6 h, 12 h and 24 h was 1.37%, 1.08%, 0.91%, 0.64% and 0.48%, respectively (
