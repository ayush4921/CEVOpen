<p>All 
 <italic>Sarcoptes</italic> eggs in negative control groups hatched. The hatching rate of positive control groups was 8.3% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008225.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The hatching rate of 
 <italic>Sarcoptes</italic> eggs exposed to lemongrass oil at the concentration of 10%, 5%, 1%, 0.5%, and 0.1% was 5%, 20%, 23.3%, 55%, and 60%, respectively. Lemongrass oil at all concentrations led to significant decrease in 
 <italic>Sarcoptes</italic> egg hatching compared to the negative control (P&lt;0.01). There is no significant difference between the positive control and the lemongrass oil at concentrations of 10% (p = 0.719), 5% (p = 0.220) and 1% (p = 0.121).
