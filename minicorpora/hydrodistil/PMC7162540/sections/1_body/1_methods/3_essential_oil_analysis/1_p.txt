0: The components of lemongrass oil were analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) using an Agilent 5977A Series GC/MSD System.
1: Analytes were separated with a HP-5MS quartz capillary column (30 m x 0.25mm x 0.25m).
2: The analysis was performed using the following temperature program: initial temperature at 60C, held for 2 min; and increased at the rate of 5C /min to 90C, held for 2 min; and increased at the rate of 5C /min to 130C; then increased at the rate of 10C /min to 150C, held for 1 min; and increased at the rate of 10C /min to 200C, held for 2 min; finally increased at the rate of 10C /min to 240C.
3: Helium was used as the carrier gas (1 mL/min) at a split ratio of 200:1.
4: The ion source temperature was 250C, and mass spectra were obtained in EI-scan mode at 70 eV electron energy.
5: The sector mass analyzer was set to scan from 35 to 500 amu.
6: Identification of compounds was based on a comparison of mass spectra of each peak with those of authentic samples in a mass spectrum library.
7: The percentages of compounds were calculated by the area normalization method.
