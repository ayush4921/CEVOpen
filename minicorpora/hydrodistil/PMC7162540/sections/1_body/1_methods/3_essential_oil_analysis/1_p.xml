<p>The components of lemongrass oil were analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) using an Agilent 5977A Series GC/MSD System. Analytes were separated with a HP-5MS quartz capillary column (30 m x 0.25mm x 0.25μm). The analysis was performed using the following temperature program: initial temperature at 60°C, held for 2 min; and increased at the rate of 5°C /min to 90°C, held for 2 min; and increased at the rate of 5°C /min to 130°C; then increased at the rate of 10°C /min to 150°C, held for 1 min; and increased at the rate of 10°C /min to 200°C, held for 2 min; finally increased at the rate of 10°C /min to 240°C. Helium was used as the carrier gas (1 mL/min) at a split ratio of 200:1. The ion source temperature was 250°C, and mass spectra were obtained in EI-scan mode at 70 eV electron energy. The sector mass analyzer was set to scan from 35 to 500 amu. Identification of compounds was based on a comparison of mass spectra of each peak with those of authentic samples in a mass spectrum library. The percentages of compounds were calculated by the area normalization method.</p>
