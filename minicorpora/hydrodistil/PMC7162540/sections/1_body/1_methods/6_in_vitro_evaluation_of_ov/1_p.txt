0: Lemongrass oil was used in five concentrations (10%, 5%, 1%, 0.5%, and 0.1%) to test the activity against  Sarcoptes eggs.
1: A filter paper was placed at the bottom of a Petri dish and impregnated with each solution (0.3 mL).
2: Negative control filter papers were treated with 0.3 mL paraffin oil, and positive control filter papers were treated with 0.3mL of 25% benzyl benzoate (Aladdin, China).
3: After they were dried in a fume hood for 10 min, 20 eggs at early stages of development were placed on the filter paper.
4: All Petri dishes were placed in a humidity chamber (70% relative humidity) at 35C.
5: For each concentration of lemongrass oil, as well as negative and positive controls, a total of three replicates were performed.
6: The hatchability of eggs was determined under a stereomicroscope 5 days after the treatments [ 5].
7: Eggs were considered dead if they failed to hatch after 5 days.
