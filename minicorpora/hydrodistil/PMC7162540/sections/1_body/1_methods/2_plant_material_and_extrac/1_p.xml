 <italic>Cymbopogon citratus</italic> plants were collected from Tianlin County of Guangxi province, China. The lemongrass oil was obtained by hydrodistillation of fresh leaves from the plant, and was dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate. For hydrodistillation, 250g of fresh lemongrass leaves were cut into small pieces and placed in a 1L flask containing 400mL of distilled water. They were hydrodistilled for 5 h using a Clevenger-type apparatus according to the method described by Guenther (1950)[

The yield of essential oil was calculated using the following formula: Essential oils yield (%) = net weight of oils (g) / total weight of fresh leaves (g) × 100. The extraction yield was 0.4%. The oil was stored in dark glass bottles and kept at 4°C until use.
