 <italic>Sarcoptes scabiei</italic> mites and eggs were collected from the crusts of naturally infested New Zealand white rabbits in a rabbit farm in Nanning, Guangxi Province, China. The crusts were placed in Petri dishes and transported to the laboratory within 1 hour. Living mites of all stages (adults, nymphs and larvae) and eggs were isolated one by one with a needle for test under a stereomicroscope.
