0: The lemongrass oil was diluted to five concentrations (10%, 5%, 1%, 0.5%, and 0.1%) with paraffin oil.
1: A contact bioassay was performed according to a previously described method [ 10].
2: Twenty mites of all motile stages (adults, nymphs and larvae) were placed into a plastic sterile Petri dish (3 cm in diameter).
3: Then, 0.5 mL of each solution was added to the Petri dishes.
4: Negative control dishes were treated with 0.5mL paraffin oil and positive control dishes were treated with 0.5mL 25% benzyl benzoate (Aladdin, China).
5: All Petri dishes were maintained at room temperature (25C) and 70% relative humidity.
6: For each concentration of lemongrass oil, as well as negative and positive controls, a total of five replicates were performed.
7: Mite mortality was monitored and evaluated under a stereomicroscope every ten minutes for 1 h, and then after 3 h, 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h of exposure to treatment.
8: Mites showing persistent immobility, even after repeated agitation with a needle, were considered dead.
