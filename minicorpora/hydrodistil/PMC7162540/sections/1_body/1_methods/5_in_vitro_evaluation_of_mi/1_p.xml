<p>The lemongrass oil was diluted to five concentrations (10%, 5%, 1%, 0.5%, and 0.1%) with paraffin oil. A contact bioassay was performed according to a previously described method [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008225.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Twenty mites of all motile stages (adults, nymphs and larvae) were placed into a plastic sterile Petri dish (3 cm in diameter). Then, 0.5 mL of each solution was added to the Petri dishes. Negative control dishes were treated with 0.5mL paraffin oil and positive control dishes were treated with 0.5mL 25% benzyl benzoate (Aladdin, China). All Petri dishes were maintained at room temperature (25Â°C) and 70% relative humidity. For each concentration of lemongrass oil, as well as negative and positive controls, a total of five replicates were performed. Mite mortality was monitored and evaluated under a stereomicroscope every ten minutes for 1 h, and then after 3 h, 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h of exposure to treatment. Mites showing persistent immobility, even after repeated agitation with a needle, were considered dead.
