<p>The genus 
 <italic>Clinopodium</italic> (Lamiaceae family) consists of 135 perennial herbs, most of them being rich sources of essential oils, distributed widely in Southern Europe, western Asia and all around the Mediterranean area [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-25-02137" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Many preclinical studies have demonstrated the inhibitory effects of 
 <italic>Clinopodium</italic> essential oils towards various bacterial and fungal strains. Their insecticidal properties have also been reported [

 <italic>Clinopodium</italic> species, 
 <italic>Clinopodium nepeta</italic> L. Kuntze (Syn. 
 <italic>Calamintha nepeta</italic> L. Kuntze) is apolymorphic and a fragrant plant that has been used traditionally around the world as an important antispasmodic, diaphoretic, stimulant, and tonic medicinal herb; it is also considered as a mint-like spice and is used in various culinary recipes [

 <xref rid="B19-molecules-25-02137" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. A literature survey of the chemical investigation of essential oils produced by 
 <italic>C. nepeta</italic> revealed the high content in oxygenated monoterpenes. Most of the phytochemical and biological studies on 
 <italic>C. nepeta</italic> did not concern the level of subspecies [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-25-02137" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, some authors take this parameter into consideration during analysis. As a consequence, the presence of remarkable variations among the major constituents of various subspecies was distinguished [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-25-02137" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Their biological features have also been well-confirmed [

 <xref rid="B23-molecules-25-02137" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Thus, antimicrobial, anti-
 <italic>Candida</italic>, antioxidant and insecticidal activities of 
 <italic>C. nepeta</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>glandulosum</italic> (Req.) Govaerts essential oils from Montenegro, Turkey, Italy, and Croatia have been reported [
