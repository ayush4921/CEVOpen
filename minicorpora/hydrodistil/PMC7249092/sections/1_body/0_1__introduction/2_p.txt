6: Most of the phytochemical and biological studies on  C. nepeta did not concern the level of subspecies [ 20].
7: However, some authors take this parameter into consideration during analysis.
8: As a consequence, the presence of remarkable variations among the major constituents of various subspecies was distinguished [ 21].
9: Their biological features have also been well-confirmed [ 22, 23].
