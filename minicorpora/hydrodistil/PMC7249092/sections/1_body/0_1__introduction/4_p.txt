0: The aim of this paper was to compare the phytochemical profile and to test the biological efficiency of the essential oils extracted from  C. nepeta subsp.
1: nepeta and  C. nepeta subsp.
2: glandulosum growing in different localities in North and North-western Tunisia ( Table 1).
3: A comprehensive evaluation of the antifungal and insecticidal activities was investigated considering the chemical variability depending on the subspecies and the geographical origin.
4: The main objective of this study was to search for environmentally friendly insecticides and antifungals that are readily biodegradable, with minimal toxic effects on health and environment and which can be marketed at premium prices.
