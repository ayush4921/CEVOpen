0: The repellency test against  T. confusum and  S. zeamais beetle adults was assessed following McDonald et al.
1: [ 53] method.
2: Briefly, 200 L of each essential oil solution, adjusted at a concentration of 2.0%, were applied to a half Whatman filter paper (No.1) disc of 9 cm diameter.
3: The other half, used as a control, was steeped with 200 L of pure acetone.
4: After air-drying for 10 min, treated and untreated halves were attached together.
5: Then, 20 adult insects of both species were released separately at the center of the filter paper disc then placed into Petri dishes.
6: After 15, 30, 60, and 120 min from the beginning of the assay the numbers of insects present on the control (Nc) and on the treated (Nt) areas were registered.
7: Each experiment was performed in four repetitions.
8: The repellency percentage values (PR) were computed as follows:  PR=[(NcNt)/(Nc+Nt)]100
