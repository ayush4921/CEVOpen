 <italic>C. nepeta</italic> subspecies essential oils were tested against

 <italic>S. zeamais</italic> following the method of Liu and Ho [
 <xref rid="B54-molecules-25-02137" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Aliquots of 1 µL from each sample at 5% concentration (10 μL of each EO dissolved in acetone) were topically applied on the thorax of insect adults using a micropipette. Insect controls were treated only with acetone. After evaporating the solvent, groups of 10 adults were introduced on glass Petri dishes (9 cm diameter). Four repetitions were carried out for each experiment. Petri dishes were kept under the same rearing conditions described above and insects mortality was recorded after 24 h of treatment (until the number of dead insects stabilized). Insects that did not record any movements were considered as dead. Abbott’s formula [
 <xref rid="B55-molecules-25-02137" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] was used to correct the mortality rate:
