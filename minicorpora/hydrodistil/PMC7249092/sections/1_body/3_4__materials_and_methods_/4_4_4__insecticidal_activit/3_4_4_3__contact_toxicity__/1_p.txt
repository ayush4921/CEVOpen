0: C. nepeta subspecies essential oils were tested against  T. confusum and  S. zeamais following the method of Liu and Ho [ 54].
1: Aliquots of 1 L from each sample at 5% concentration (10 L of each EO dissolved in acetone) were topically applied on the thorax of insect adults using a micropipette.
2: Insect controls were treated only with acetone.
3: After evaporating the solvent, groups of 10 adults were introduced on glass Petri dishes (9 cm diameter).
4: Four repetitions were carried out for each experiment.
5: Petri dishes were kept under the same rearing conditions described above and insects mortality was recorded after 24 h of treatment (until the number of dead insects stabilized).
6: Insects that did not record any movements were considered as dead.
7: Abbotts formula [ 55] was used to correct the mortality rate: %Mc=[(M0Mt)/(100Mt)]100 where Mc: Corrected mortality rate; and M 0 and Mt: Mortality rate of treated and control insects, respectively.
