<p>Analyses of essential oil chemical compositions were performed using an Agilent 7890B gas chromatograph equipped with an auto sampler (PAL RSI 85) and coupled to a 5977B single quadrupole mass analyzer (Santa Clara, Californy, USA). Injection of 1 μL of the diluted sample (1:2000 dilution) in 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane (Carlo Erba, Milan, Italy) in the front inlet set at 280 °C was performed in split mode (1:100) with a split flow of 120 mL/min using an Agilent 5190-3983 liner (800 μL). Separation was performed using a 30 m × 0.25 mm i.d. × 0.25 μm film thickness, 5% phenylmethylpolysiloxane, HP-5MS capillary column (Agilent, Folsom, CA, USA) and helium (99.99%) was the carrier gas flown at 1.2 mL/min. The following oven temperature program was used: 60 °C for 5 min, then 4 °C/min up to 160 °C, then 11 °C/min up to 280 °C with a hold time of 15 min, and finally 15 °C/min until 300 °C for a total run time of 57.74 min. MSD transfer line temperature was set at 300 °C. Analysis was made in electron impact (EI) mode (internal ionization source; 70 eV) with a scan range from 29 to 400 m/z, after a solvent delay of 2.5 min. The compounds were identified by two approaches: (i) correspondence of retention indices (RIs) reported in libraries [
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-25-02137" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] (NIST 17, 2017; FFNSC 2, 2012) with the ones calculated using a mixture of n-alkanes (C
 <sub>8</sub>–C
 <sub>30</sub>, Supelco, Bellefonte, CA, USA); (ii) comparison of the obtained mass spectra with those stored in libraries (WILEY275, ADAMS, NIST 17 and FFNSC 2); (iii) co-injection with available analytical standards. The chromatograms have been integrated and the relative abundance (%) of each compound was obtained (% = 100 ×

The coefficient of variation obtained ranged from 0.3% to 5.8%. The inter-day repeatability of the GC/MS method was determined by 3-day replicate analyses of volatiles, evaluated on the same aliquot of sample stored in the refrigerator, CV% ranged from 0.1% to 3.9%, accounting for very high constant results.
