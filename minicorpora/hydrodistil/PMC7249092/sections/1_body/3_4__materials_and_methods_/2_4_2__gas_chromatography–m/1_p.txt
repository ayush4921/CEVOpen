0: Analyses of essential oil chemical compositions were performed using an Agilent 7890B gas chromatograph equipped with an auto sampler (PAL RSI 85) and coupled to a 5977B single quadrupole mass analyzer (Santa Clara, Californy, USA).
1: Injection of 1 L of the diluted sample (1:2000 dilution) in  n-hexane (Carlo Erba, Milan, Italy) in the front inlet set at 280 C was performed in split mode (1:100) with a split flow of 120 mL/min using an Agilent 5190-3983 liner (800 L).
2: Separation was performed using a 30 m  0.25 mm i.d.
3: 0.25 m film thickness, 5% phenylmethylpolysiloxane, HP-5MS capillary column (Agilent, Folsom, CA, USA) and helium (99.99%) was the carrier gas flown at 1.2 mL/min.
4: The following oven temperature program was used: 60 C for 5 min, then 4 C/min up to 160 C, then 11 C/min up to 280 C with a hold time of 15 min, and finally 15 C/min until 300 C for a total run time of 57.74 min.
5: MSD transfer line temperature was set at 300 C. Analysis was made in electron impact (EI) mode (internal ionization source; 70 eV) with a scan range from 29 to 400 m/z, after a solvent delay of 2.5 min.
6: The compounds were identified by two approaches: (i) correspondence of retention indices (RIs) reported in libraries [ 50] (NIST 17, 2017; FFNSC 2, 2012) with the ones calculated using a mixture of n-alkanes (C 8C 30, Supelco, Bellefonte, CA, USA); (ii) comparison of the obtained mass spectra with those stored in libraries (WILEY275, ADAMS, NIST 17 and FFNSC 2); (iii) co-injection with available analytical standards.
7: The chromatograms have been integrated and the relative abundance (%) of each compound was obtained (% = 100   peakarea/totalpeakarea).
8: The repeatability is expressed by coefficient of variation (CV)% obtained performing the GC/MS analyses in triplicate of the different samples.
9: The coefficient of variation obtained ranged from 0.3% to 5.8%.
10: The inter-day repeatability of the GC/MS method was determined by 3-day replicate analyses of volatiles, evaluated on the same aliquot of sample stored in the refrigerator, CV% ranged from 0.1% to 3.9%, accounting for very high constant results.
