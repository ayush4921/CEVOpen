<p>Actually, the antifungal, repellent and insecticidal assays put in evidence that CNG
 <sub>1</sub> essential oil was the most active one. This oil was characterized by the highest percentages of piperitenone oxide (39.3 vs. 23.4 and 27.8% of CNN and CNG
 <sub>2,</sub> respectively). This monoterpenoid, endowed with an epoxide group, is typical of several 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> L. essential oils, for instance 
 <italic>M. longifolia</italic> L., 
 <italic>M. suaveolens</italic> Ehrh. and 
 <italic>M. microphylla</italic> K. Koch, which have demonstrated significant toxicity against stored product insects and fungal species [

 <xref rid="B47-molecules-25-02137" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Its biological power is given by the epoxide ring, which is interacting with proteins, neurotransmitters and nucleic acids [

 <italic>C. nepeta</italic> subspecies oils showed differences in the activity against 
 <italic>T. confusum</italic> and 
 <italic>S. zeamais</italic>. Thus, repellent and toxic effects of the tested essential oils depend on the chemical composition variability as well as the insect susceptibility.
