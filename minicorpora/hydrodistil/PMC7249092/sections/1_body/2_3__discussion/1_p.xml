<p>The main purpose of this study was to investigate for the first time the phytochemical variability in Tunisian 
 <italic>C. nepeta</italic> essential oils taking into consideration the subspecies 
 <italic>nepeta</italic> and 
 <italic>glandulosum</italic> and their environmental origin (Béni-M’tir and Bizerta), and consequently its effect on the biological properties. As shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-02137-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, 
 <italic>C. nepeta</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>nepeta</italic> and subsp. 
 <italic>glandulosum</italic> essential oils were mostly characterized by high contents of piperitone oxide and piperitenone oxide. Though the type oil resemblance between the subspecies, some quantitative and qualitative differences have been highlighted. Importantly, piperitone oxide which ranks first in CNN essential oil (51.7%), was identified as the second most abundant phytochemical (23.5%) in CNG
 <sub>1</sub> after piperitenone oxide (39.3%). Nonetheless, the monoterpene piperitone ranks second in frequency in CNG
 <sub>2</sub> population (19.5%) and was totally absent in the remaining analyzed samples. Some reports stated a strong relationship between the variability of 
 <italic>C. nepeta</italic> essential oil chemical compositions and the geographical origin, environmental conditions and the vegetative state of the plants [
