 <p>The present investigation was focused on the study of the chemical composition variability and biological activities of the essential oils from 
  <italic>Clinopodium nepeta</italic> subsp. 
  <italic>nepeta</italic> and subsp. 
  <italic>glandulosum</italic>. Essential oils extraction was performed using hydrodistillation and the separation of the constituents was carried out by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Antifungal activities were tested against 
  <italic>Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus terreus</italic>, 
  <italic>Microsporum canis</italic>, 
  <italic>Microsporum gypseum</italic>, 
  <italic>Trichophyton mentagrophytes,</italic> and 
  <italic>Candida albicans</italic>. Toxicity and repellency were evaluated against the stored product pests 
  <italic>Tribolium confusum</italic> and 
  <italic>Sitophilus zeamais</italic>. Both essential oils were characterized by a high content of oxygenated monoterpenes. Piperitone ranks first in the subspecies 
  <italic>nepeta</italic> and piperitenone oxide is the dominant constituent in the subspecies 
  <italic>glandulosum</italic>. All tested samples displayed noteworthy antifungal properties, with the highest activity observed for the essential oil of 
  <italic>C. nepeta</italic> subsp. 
  <italic>glandulosum</italic>, collected in Béni-M’tir, against 
  <italic>T. mentagrophytes</italic> (MIC = 40 µg/mL). The essential oil samples of 
  <italic>C. nepeta</italic> subsp. 
  <italic>glandulosum</italic> were strongly repellent to the insect species (PR &gt; 80%, after 2h) and highly toxic to 
  <italic>S. zeamais</italic> reaching 97.5%–100% mortality after 24 h of exposure. In conclusion, this study showed considerable intra-specific changes in the quality of 
  <italic>C. nepeta</italic> essential oils, which is reflected in different rates of antifungal and insecticidal activity.
