<p id="Par22">Antioxidant activities of hydrodistilled nanocapsules and nanoemulsion samples of 
 <italic>O. glandulosum</italic> Desf. oil were evaluated using DPPH radical scavenging assay. Results are summarized in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. The hydrodistilled oil of 
 <italic>O. glandulosum</italic> Desf. had the lowest IC
 <sub>50</sub> (4.22 mg/mL) which indicates a higher antioxidant activity, followed by nanocapsules of the oil (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 57.51 mg/mL) and the nanoemulsions of the oil (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 78.50 mg/mL). These values can be further explained by analyzing the total content of phenolics and flavonoids present in the samples and the differences in volatile compounds identified among the samples. Hydrodistilled oil, with the highest phenolic and flavonoid contents, was the most effective radical scavenger in comparison to synthetic antioxidant TBHQ, whereas nanoemulsions of the oil was the least effective (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Many effective phenolic components were detected in both hydrodistilled oil and its nanocapsules but very low amounts of phenolics, especially thymol and carvacrol, were present in oil nanoemulsions (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Naturally occurring phenolic compounds have been reported to be more effective as antioxidants with higher activities than synthetic ones

 </sup>. However, the synergistic interaction between the phenolic content and the other components in the essential oil is also responsible for the high antioxidant activity

 </sup>. The above results are consistent with the previous reports published by Sari 
 <italic>et al</italic>.

 </sup> who studied the antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>O. glandulosum</italic> Desf. oil but not its encapsulated forms. Therefore, the results presented in this study suggests that the essential oil of 
 <italic>O. glandulosum</italic> Desf. as well as its nanocapsules and nanoemulsions offer a cost-effective source of biological ingredients which can be used as antioxidants in food and pharmaceutical formulae instead of synthetic antioxidants.
