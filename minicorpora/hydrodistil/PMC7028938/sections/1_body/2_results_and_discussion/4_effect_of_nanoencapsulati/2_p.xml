<p id="Par25">Many bioactive compounds that are well–known as anticancer agents, including borneol, p-cymene, γ-terpinene, α-terpineol, caryophyllene, thymol, and carvacrol, were identified as major constituents in 
 <italic>O. glandulosum</italic> Desf. oil as well as its nanoemulsions and nanocapsules

 </sup>. However, quantitative differences exist in the volatile constituents detected (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). This might be contributing to considerable differences in the anticancer and cytotoxic activities between 
 <italic>O. glandulosum</italic> Desf. oil and its nanoparticles. According to Ozcan and Erdogan

 </sup>, the essential oil of 
 <italic>Origanum onites</italic> L. was found to be less toxic than its major components, thymol and carvacrol. Both phenols were the predominant components of nanocapsules of 
 <italic>O. glandulosum</italic> Desf. oil (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Therefore, it can be concluded that the higher cytotoxicity of the nanocapsules can come from its phenolic components thymol and carvacrol regardless the total phenolic and flavonoid contents. The expected cytotoxicity mechanism of carvacrol, thymol and/or oregano essential oils, might be due to the induction of Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) which plays a major role in detoxifying carcinogens

 </sup>. These findings suggest that, further studies will be necessary in order to reveal the correlation between antioxidant and anticancer activities along with the synergetic and/or antagonistic among constituents of botanical extracts.
