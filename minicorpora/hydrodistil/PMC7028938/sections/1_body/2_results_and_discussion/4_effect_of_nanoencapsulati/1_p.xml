<p id="Par24">The presumed cytotoxic effects of 
 <italic>O. glandulosum</italic> Desf. Oil nanoemulsions and nanocapsules against Hep G-2 and THLE2 were investigated in this study, using MTT viability assay. 5-flurouracil was used as a reference drug. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> shows a reduction in cell viability percentage of liver cancer cell line (Hep G-2) after treatment with 
 <italic>O. glandulosum</italic> Desf. Oil nanoemulsions and nanocapsules, as compared to treated THLE2 cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Nanocapsules of the oil exhibited the highest growth inhibitory activity against Hep G-2 cell line with the lowest IC
 <sub>50</sub> (54.93 μg/mL) compared to 5-Fu (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 40.95), followed by the hydrodistilled oil (73.13 μg/mL) whereas the nanoemulsions of the oil showed the least inhibition with IC
 <sub>50</sub> (131.6 μg/mL). The lower IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of Hep G-2 cells in comparison to THLE2 cells, showing the selectivity of the studied 
 <italic>O. glandulosum</italic> Desf. oil as well as its nanoemulsions and nanocapsules.
