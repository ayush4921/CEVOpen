<p id="Par23">Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) was used to investigate the morphology of the nanoparticles. Nanoemulsion particles appear dark and spherical in shape with an average diameter of 26.8 ± 0.11 nm (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>). On the other hand, the size of nanocapsules was slightly bigger (34.65 ± 0.76 nm in diameter) due to the incorporation of oil droplets inside the sodium alginate wall (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). This is in agreement with the results published by Sotelo-Boyas 
 <italic>et al</italic>.

 </sup> where they showed that the increase in nanocapsule size is related to encapsulation of the oil. The morphology of the outer surface of the capsule show the presence of the carrier agents with spherical shapes and smooth surfaces. The TEM image do not show any cracks or pores in the nanocapsules. As the bioactive constituents of 
 <italic>O. glandulosum</italic> Desf. oil used in this work are highly volatile, the absence of cracks or pores on the surface of the nanocapsules represents a key feature, suggesting that it could protect volatiles against release, degradation or interaction with environmental factors.
