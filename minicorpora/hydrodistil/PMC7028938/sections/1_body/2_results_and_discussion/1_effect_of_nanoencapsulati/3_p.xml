<p id="Par20">As shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>, the nanocapsules of the essential oil of 
 <italic>O. glandulosum</italic> Desf. are characterized by the presence of 17 volatile constituents representing 98.50% of the total oil. Thymol (31.81%), carvacrol (28.45%), γ-Terpinene (15.26%) and p-cymene (9.09%) were the main constituents identified among the volatiles. These constituents are similar to those detected in hydrodistilled essential oil (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). A significant quantitative difference was observed in the level of montoterpenes between hydrodistilled oil and nanocapsuled essential oil. Additionally, the majority of sesqueterpenes were not detected in the nanocapsules extract. This is obviously due to the processing technique which depends on homogenization at approximately 18000 rpm. However, it is less intense than the preparation of nanoemulsion. Hence, the volatiles profile of oil nanocapsules is still similar to that of the hydrodistilled oil and belongs to the thymol and / or carvacrol chemotype.
