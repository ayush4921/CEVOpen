<p id="Par19">The volatiles composition of the oil nanoemulsion was found to be dramatically different from that of the hydrodistilled oil. In the oil nanoemulsion, α-terpineol (35.68%), borneol (34.29%) and Thymol (13.47%) were identified as the major constituents (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). Only thirteen compounds were detected in oil nanoemulsion which accounts for 98.69% of the volatile material. Carvacrol, γ-terpinene, p-cymene and many sesquiterpenes were found in very low amounts or not detected at all. Several recent studies have investigated the formulation of nanoemulsion of essential oils and their biological activities. However, very few studies have evaluated how the encapsulation changes the essential oil constituents and consequently the biological activities of the essential oils. Jumaa

 </sup> reported a reduction in antimicrobial activity of nanoemulsions in comparison to uncapsulated active ingredients. Inappropriate formulation may lead to flocculation, Ostwald ripening or coalescence of the emulsion leading to a reduction in its stability and biological efficiency

 </sup> reported that high pressure homogenization as well as high shear homogenization results in decomposition of active constituents of essential oils particularly p-cymene, terpinenes, carveol, carvacrol and others. Interestingly, they reported a significant decrease in the amount of carvacrol as the process intensity increased from high shear homogenization to high pressure homogenization. This is in agreement with our GC-MS data which shows a large decrease in carvacrol upon nanoemulsion formation (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).
