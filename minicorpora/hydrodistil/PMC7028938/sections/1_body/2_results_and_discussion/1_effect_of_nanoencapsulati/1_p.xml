<p id="Par18">The dried aerial parts of 
 <italic>O. glandulosum</italic> Desf. when subjected to hydrodistillation, produced yellowish oil with a yield 1.73 ± 0.06%. These numbers were in agreement with the findings of Belhattab 
 <italic>et al</italic>.

 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>). The predominant compounds in the hydrodistilled oil were carvacrol (26.29%), γ-Terpinene (23.43%), Thymol (19.52%), p-cymene (11.67%) and α-Terpinene (3.02%). These findings suggest that the oil belongs to the thymol and /or carvacrol chemotype which is consistent with the findings from previous studies by Sari 
 <italic>et al</italic>.
