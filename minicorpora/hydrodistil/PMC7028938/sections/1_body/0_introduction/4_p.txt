0: Nanoemulsion is one of the nanostructures which can be formulated within the droplet size range of 20200 nm and has with a higher kinetic stability suggesting that it will exhibit stability during storage.
1: Nanoemulsion, a step towards nanoencapsulation, is formulated through emulsification of oily and aqueous phases using an emulsifier coating molecule 11.
2: Nanocapsules have been formulated using biodegradable polymers as wall materials, including whey protein 12, sodium caseinate 13 and modified starch or maltodextrin 14.
