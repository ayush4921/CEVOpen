0: The above information provides the rationale behind this study that aimed to formulate nanocapsules and nanoemulsion containing  O. glandulosum Desf.
1: oil.
2: The effects of different nanoencapsulation forms of the essential oil on the volatile constituents, antioxidant activity as well as the cytotoxic effect on liver cancer cell line Hep-G2 were evaluated.
3: Healthy human hepatic cells THLE2 were used as a control to test the putative selectivity of the oil and its nanoparticles.
4: The present study therefore opens perspectives for safer solutions employing compounds of botanical origin associated with nanotechnology for application in both food industry and cancer treatment.
