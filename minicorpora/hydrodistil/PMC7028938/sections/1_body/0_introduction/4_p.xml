<p id="Par5">Nanoemulsion is one of the nanostructures which can be formulated within the droplet size range of 20–200 nm and has with a higher kinetic stability suggesting that it will exhibit stability during storage. Nanoemulsion, a step towards nanoencapsulation, is formulated through emulsification of oily and aqueous phases using an emulsifier coating molecule
