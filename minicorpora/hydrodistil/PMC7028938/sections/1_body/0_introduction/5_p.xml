<p id="Par6">The above information provides the rationale behind this study that aimed to formulate nanocapsules and nanoemulsion containing 
 <italic>O. glandulosum</italic> Desf. oil. The effects of different nanoencapsulation forms of the essential oil on the volatile constituents, antioxidant activity as well as the cytotoxic effect on liver cancer cell line Hep-G2 were evaluated. Healthy human hepatic cells THLE2 were used as a control to test the putative selectivity of the oil and its nanoparticles. The present study therefore opens perspectives for safer solutions employing compounds of botanical origin associated with nanotechnology for application in both food industry and cancer treatment.
