 <italic>O. glandulosum</italic> Desf. essential oil-in-water nanoemulsions were prepared using a High-Pressure Homogenization (HPH) technique. Primary emulsions were obtained by mixing a solution consisting of 1 g oil and 1% of Tween 20 in 100 mL of deionized water using an Ultra Turrax T25 (IKA Labortechnik, Germany) at 24000 rpm for 10 min. The primary emulsions were then subjected to HPH in a Nano DeBEE Electric Bench-top Laboratory homogenizer (BEE International, USA) at 350 MPa; the procedure was repeated ten times. Crystallization of the lipid droplets was attained by rapid cooling of the hot nanoemulsions in an ice bath at the end of the HPH processing
