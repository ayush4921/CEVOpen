0: Nanoencapsulation of  O. glandulosum Desf.
1: essential oil was performed using the homogenization technique (Homogenizer PRO 400 PC, SN: 04-01198, U.S.A.) as previously described by Hussein  et al.
2: 16 with some modifications.
3: Briefly, sodium alginate was dissolved in distilled water at a concentration of 3 g/100 mL.
4: The solution was left standing for 24 h to disengage bubble before use.
5: One gram of oil and 1% of Tween 20 was added to 100 mL of the polymer solution.
6: The emulsion was created by mixing the solution in a high-speed homogenizer at 18.000 rpm for 20 min.
7: The temperature was maintained at 25 C. After preparation, samples were stored at 4 C until use.
