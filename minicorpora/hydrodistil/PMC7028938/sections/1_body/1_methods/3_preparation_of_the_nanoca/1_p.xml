 </sup> with some modifications. Briefly, sodium alginate was dissolved in distilled water at a concentration of 3 g/100 mL. The solution was left standing for 24 h to disengage bubble before use. One gram of oil and 1% of Tween 20 was added to 100 mL of the polymer solution. The emulsion was created by mixing the solution in a high-speed homogenizer at 18.000 rpm for 20 min. The temperature was maintained at 25 °C. After preparation, samples were stored at 4 °C until use.
