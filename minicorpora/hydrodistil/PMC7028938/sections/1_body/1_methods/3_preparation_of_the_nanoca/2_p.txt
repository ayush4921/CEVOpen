0: The  O. glandulosum Desf.
1: essential oil-in-water nanoemulsions were prepared using a High-Pressure Homogenization (HPH) technique.
2: Primary emulsions were obtained by mixing a solution consisting of 1 g oil and 1% of Tween 20 in 100 mL of deionized water using an Ultra Turrax T25 (IKA Labortechnik, Germany) at 24000 rpm for 10 min.
3: The primary emulsions were then subjected to HPH in a Nano DeBEE Electric Bench-top Laboratory homogenizer (BEE International, USA) at 350 MPa; the procedure was repeated ten times.
4: Crystallization of the lipid droplets was attained by rapid cooling of the hot nanoemulsions in an ice bath at the end of the HPH processing 17.
