<p id="Par11">The components of the essential oil obtained using HD and the volatile compounds extracted from nanocapsules and nanoemulsion were analyzed using a GC–MS apparatus. Separation was performed on a Trace GC Ultra Chromatography system (Thermo Scientific, USA) equipped with an ISQ-mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, USA) with a 60 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm-thick TG-5MS capillary column (Thermo Scientific, USA). The column separation was programmed at 50 °C with a holding time of 3 min, and then the temperature was increased at a rate of 4 °C per min to 140 °C with a holding time of 5 min. Thereafter, the temperature was increased at a rate of 6 °C per minute to 260 °C for a 5-minisothermal holding time. The injector temperature was 180 °C, the ion source temperature was 200 °C, and the transition line temperature was 250 °C. The carrier gas was helium with a constant flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The mass spectrometer had a scan range from m/z 40–450, and the ionization energy was set at 70 Ev. The identification of compounds was based on matching profiles with the MS computer library (NIST library, 2005 version) and comparison with authentic compounds and published data
