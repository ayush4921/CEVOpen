0: The components of the essential oil obtained using HD and the volatile compounds extracted from nanocapsules and nanoemulsion were analyzed using a GCMS apparatus.
1: Separation was performed on a Trace GC Ultra Chromatography system (Thermo Scientific, USA) equipped with an ISQ-mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, USA) with a 60 m  0.25 mm  0.25 m-thick TG-5MS capillary column (Thermo Scientific, USA).
2: The column separation was programmed at 50 C with a holding time of 3 min, and then the temperature was increased at a rate of 4 C per min to 140 C with a holding time of 5 min.
3: Thereafter, the temperature was increased at a rate of 6 C per minute to 260 C for a 5-minisothermal holding time.
4: The injector temperature was 180 C, the ion source temperature was 200 C, and the transition line temperature was 250 C. The carrier gas was helium with a constant flow rate of 1.0 mL/min.
5: The mass spectrometer had a scan range from m/z 40450, and the ionization energy was set at 70 Ev.
6: The identification of compounds was based on matching profiles with the MS computer library (NIST library, 2005 version) and comparison with authentic compounds and published data 28.
7: The relative percentage of the identified constituents was calculated from the GC peak areas.
8: Kovats index was calculated for each compound, using the retention times of a homologous series of C 6C 26 n-alkanes and by matching with the values reported in literature 5,  18,  28.
