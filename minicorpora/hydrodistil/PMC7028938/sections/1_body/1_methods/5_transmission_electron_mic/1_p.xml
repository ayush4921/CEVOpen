<p id="Par12">The morphology of nanocapsules and naoemulsions was obtained using transmission electron microscopy (JED 1230, JEOL Ltd., and Tokyo, Japan). Twenty microliters of the diluted sample was placed on a film-coated with 200-mesh copper specimen grid for 10 min and the excess fluid was removed by blotting with filter paper. The grids were then stained with one drop of 3% phosphotungstic acid and allowed to dry for 3 min. The coated grids were dried and examined under the TEM microscope. The samples were observed by operating at 160 kV. The average particle size was calculated from TEM images using the ImageJ software
