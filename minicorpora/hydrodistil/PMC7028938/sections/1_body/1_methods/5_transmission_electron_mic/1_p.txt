0: The morphology of nanocapsules and naoemulsions was obtained using transmission electron microscopy (JED 1230, JEOL Ltd., and Tokyo, Japan).
1: Twenty microliters of the diluted sample was placed on a film-coated with 200-mesh copper specimen grid for 10 min and the excess fluid was removed by blotting with filter paper.
2: The grids were then stained with one drop of 3% phosphotungstic acid and allowed to dry for 3 min.
3: The coated grids were dried and examined under the TEM microscope.
4: The samples were observed by operating at 160 kV.
5: The average particle size was calculated from TEM images using the ImageJ software 19.
