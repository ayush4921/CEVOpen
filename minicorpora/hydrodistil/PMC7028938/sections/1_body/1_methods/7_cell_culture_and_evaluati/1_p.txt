0: Both HepG2 and THLE2 cells were seeded at a density of 1  10 4 cells/well (100 l/well) in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) FCS and 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin solution and incubated at 37 C and 5% CO 2 for 24 hr to obtain 7080% confluent cultures.
1: The oil and its nanoparticles were applied separately at different concentrations to the wells to achieve final concentrations ranging from 200 to 6.25 g/ml for HepG2 cells and from 600 to 6.25 g/ml for THLE2.
2: The positive control wells were supplemented with different concentrations (5400 g/mL) of 5-FU.
3: At the end of incubation, 10 l of 12 mM MTT stock solution (5 mg/ml MTT in sterile PBS) was added to each well.
4: The plate was then incubated for 4 hr at 37 C. MTT solution was removed and the purple formazan crystal formed at the bottom of the wells was dissolved with 100 l DMSO for 20 min.
5: A negative control of 10 l of MTT stock solution was added to 100 l of medium alone.
6: The absorbance at  max 570 nm was read on an ELISA reader.
7: The proportion of surviving cells was calculated as (OD of sample  OD of blank)/(OD of control  OD of blank)  100%.
8: Sigmoidal and dose dependent curves were constructed to plot the results of the experiment.
9: Assays were performed in triplicate.
10: The concentration of the compounds inhibiting 50% of cells (IC 50) was calculated using the sigmoidal curve 23.
