<p id="Par16">Both HepG2 and THLE2 cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well (100 μl/well) in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) FCS and 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin solution and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 24 hr to obtain 70–80% confluent cultures. The oil and its nanoparticles were applied separately at different concentrations to the wells to achieve final concentrations ranging from 200 to 6.25 μg/ml for HepG2 cells and from 600 to 6.25 μg/ml for THLE2. The positive control wells were supplemented with different concentrations (5–400 µg/mL) of 5-FU. At the end of incubation, 10 μl of 12 mM MTT stock solution (5 mg/ml MTT in sterile PBS) was added to each well. The plate was then incubated for 4 hr at 37 °C. MTT solution was removed and the purple formazan crystal formed at the bottom of the wells was dissolved with 100 μl DMSO for 20 min. A negative control of 10 μl of MTT stock solution was added to 100 μl of medium alone. The absorbance at λ max 570 nm was read on an ELISA reader. The proportion of surviving cells was calculated as (OD of sample − OD of blank)/(OD of control − OD of blank) × 100%. Sigmoidal and dose dependent curves were constructed to plot the results of the experiment. Assays were performed in triplicate. The concentration of the compounds inhibiting 50% of cells (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) was calculated using the sigmoidal curve
