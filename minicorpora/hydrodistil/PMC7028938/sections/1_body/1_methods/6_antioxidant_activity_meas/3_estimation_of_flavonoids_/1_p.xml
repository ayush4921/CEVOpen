<p id="Par15">The flavonoid content in samples was determined spectrophotometrically using a method based on the formation of a complex flavonoid–aluminium, having maximum absorptivity at 430 nm. Rutin was used to make the calibration curve. Thereafter, 1 mL of diluted samples were separately mixed with 1 mL of 2% aluminum chloride methanolic solution. After incubation at room temperature for 15 min, the absorbance of the reaction mixture was measured at 430 nm and the flavonoids content was expressed in mg per g of rutin equivalent (RE)
