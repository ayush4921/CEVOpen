0: The flavonoid content in samples was determined spectrophotometrically using a method based on the formation of a complex flavonoidaluminium, having maximum absorptivity at 430 nm.
1: Rutin was used to make the calibration curve.
2: Thereafter, 1 mL of diluted samples were separately mixed with 1 mL of 2% aluminum chloride methanolic solution.
3: After incubation at room temperature for 15 min, the absorbance of the reaction mixture was measured at 430 nm and the flavonoids content was expressed in mg per g of rutin equivalent (RE) 22.
