<p id="Par26">The effect of nanometric delivery systems of 
 <italic>O. glandulosum</italic> Desf. oil on antioxidant and anticancer activities as well as volatile constituents was investigated as a method to employ compounds of botanical origin for application in both food industry and cancer treatment. Using of high - speed and high - pressure homogenization techniques during encapsulation affected dramatically the volatile constituents of delivery systems in comparison to the original oil and therefore the biological activities. Further studies are necessary in order to explain the behavior of chemical constituents during different encapsulation processes and thereby evaluate the compatibility of the different encapsulation techniques for a set of natural oils and flavors.
