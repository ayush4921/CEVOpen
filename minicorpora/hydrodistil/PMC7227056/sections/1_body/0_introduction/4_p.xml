<p>Several methods, such as hydrodistillation, solvent extraction, simultaneous distillationâ€“extraction, and solid-phase microextraction have been used for essential oil production.

 </sup> Hydrodistillation is the most widely used method, although some water-soluble compounds are not obtained and thermolabile compounds can be degraded in the process.

 </sup> Hydrodistillation can be divided into water distillation and steam distillation. Steam distillation differs from water distillation so that the steam is passed through the raw material and the oil evaporates, whereas in the case of water distillation, the plant material and water are put to the same vessel and allowed to boil. Direct solvent extraction is an alternative method used. This method is dependent on the solubility of compounds and the extracts are usually mixtures of volatile and nonvolatile constituents. Hexane, toluene, or other nonpolar solvents are often used. In this method, resin acids, fats, waxes, and pigments are often extracted, too.
