 </sup> Bioactive compounds are also the main constituents of essential oils, which are obtained via steam distillation or solvent extraction of plant materials, and have a characteristic aroma or fragrance. Essential oils are complex chemical mixtures of volatile and nonvolatile constituents (e.g., terpene hydrocarbons, acids, esters, and phenolic compounds). These secondary metabolites are important for plants’ defense mechanisms against biotic and abiotic stresses.
