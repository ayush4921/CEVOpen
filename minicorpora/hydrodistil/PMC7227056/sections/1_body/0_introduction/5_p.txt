0: Chemical compositions of essential oils and solvent extracts obtained from conifer trees have been extensively studied by gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GCMS).
1: 9,  16,  20,  22,  23 The compositions of lipophilic extracts of different pine species have also been characterized.
2: 30,  31 Even though many compounds can be derivatized prior to the GCMS measurement (in order to improve thermal stability and enhance volatility) and more polar columns can be used, 32 GCMS is still limited to the most volatile compound fractions.
3: As an alternative strategy, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to MS has also been used to determine the flavonoid content in buds and young needles of  Pinus peuce( 33) and  P. abies and some other  Pinus species.
4: 34 Other analytical techniques that have been used in the analysis of essential oils include ultraviolet (UV), Fourier transform infrared, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopies, 35  37 but each of these techniques have their own intrinsic limitations and they do not provide very detailed information on the complex chemical composition.
