0: Conifers are a group of cone-bearing gymnosperms, found in most terrestrial habitats.
1: They are seed plants and woody plants that are mostly trees, though a few are shrubs.
2: 10 Their ability to habituate in extreme environments and a strong defense system have contributed to their successful colonization of the northern hemisphere.
3: 11 They also contribute significantly to the terrestrial photosynthesis and biomass production.
4: Conifers are dominant forest tree species in Finland, with Scots pine ( Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce ( Picea abies) being the most abundant, occupying ca.
5: 66 and 24% of the forested areas, respectively.
6: 12,  13 Conifers have complex secondary metabolite profiles, consisting of volatile and nonvolatile compounds.
7: 14 They are widely distributed worldwide, comprising seven families with a total of 600630 species.
8: Conifer trees are an important resource as solid fuel (wood or charcoal) and a source of other plant-derived products (e.g., resins, essential oils, and ornaments).
