 </sup> Their ability to habituate in extreme environments and a strong defense system have contributed to their successful colonization of the northern hemisphere.

 </sup> They also contribute significantly to the terrestrial photosynthesis and biomass production. Conifers are dominant forest tree species in Finland, with Scots pine (
 <italic>Pinus sylvestris</italic> L.) and Norway spruce (
 <italic>Picea abies</italic>) being the most abundant, occupying ca. 66 and 24% of the forested areas, respectively.

 </sup> Conifers have complex secondary metabolite profiles, consisting of volatile and nonvolatile compounds.
 <sup>

 </sup> They are widely distributed worldwide, comprising seven families with a total of 600â€“630 species. Conifer trees are an important resource as solid fuel (wood or charcoal) and a source of other plant-derived products (e.g., resins, essential oils, and ornaments).
