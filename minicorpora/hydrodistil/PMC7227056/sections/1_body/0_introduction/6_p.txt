0: In this work, we used ultrahigh-resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) MS for direct chemical fingerprinting of essential oils and solvent extracts obtained from the needles of four conifer tree species, namely Scots pine ( P. sylvestris), common juniper ( Juniperus communis), Norway spruce ( P. abies), and European larch ( Larix decidua).
1: Two different ionization techniques, negative-ion electrospray ionization, ()ESI, and positive-ion atmospheric-pressure photoionization, (+)APPI, were employed to target both polar and nonpolar constituents in the oil samples.
2: Based on the results, conifer needle essential oils possess a rich chemistry, which offer a considerable potential for a variety of biotechnological and medicinal applications.
