<p>In this work, we used ultrahigh-resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) MS for direct chemical fingerprinting of essential oils and solvent extracts obtained from the needles of four conifer tree species, namely Scots pine (
 <italic>P. sylvestris</italic>), common juniper (
 <italic>Juniperus communis</italic>), Norway spruce (
 <italic>P. abies</italic>), and European larch (
 <italic>Larix decidua</italic>). Two different ionization techniques, negative-ion electrospray ionization, (âˆ’)ESI, and positive-ion atmospheric-pressure photoionization, (+)APPI, were employed to target both polar and nonpolar constituents in the oil samples. Based on the results, conifer needle essential oils possess a rich chemistry, which offer a considerable potential for a variety of biotechnological and medicinal applications.
