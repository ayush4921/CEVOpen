0: Plants serve as important raw materials in food and nonfood industrial products.
1: They are rich sources of nonstructural compounds, which find use in pharmaceutical, cosmetics, agricultural, food, and other related industries.
2: 1,  2 These bioactive plant compounds (phytochemicals) are known for their pronounced antioxidant, antifungal, antibacterial, insecticidal, and herbicidal character.
3: 3,  4 Bioactive compounds are also the main constituents of essential oils, which are obtained via steam distillation or solvent extraction of plant materials, and have a characteristic aroma or fragrance.
4: Essential oils are complex chemical mixtures of volatile and nonvolatile constituents (e.g., terpene hydrocarbons, acids, esters, and phenolic compounds).
5: These secondary metabolites are important for plants defense mechanisms against biotic and abiotic stresses.
6: 5  8 Essential oils are a great reservoir of bioactive compounds, hence an increased interest in them.
