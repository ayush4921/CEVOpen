<p>Chemical compositions of essential oils and solvent extracts obtained from conifer trees have been extensively studied by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS).

 </sup> Even though many compounds can be derivatized prior to the GC–MS measurement (in order to improve thermal stability and enhance volatility) and more polar columns can be used,

 </sup> GC–MS is still limited to the most volatile compound fractions. As an alternative strategy, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to MS has also been used to determine the flavonoid content in buds and young needles of
