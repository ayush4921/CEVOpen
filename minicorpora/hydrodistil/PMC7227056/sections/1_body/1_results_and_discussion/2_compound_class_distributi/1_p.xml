<p>A total of 12 different O

 </sub> classes (i.e., compounds containing 
 <italic>x</italic> oxygen atoms and variable amounts of C and H atoms) were detected for the essential oils and solvent extracts (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.0c00901/suppl_file/ao0c00901_si_001.pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Figures S1 and S2</ext-link>). The O

  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> classes of O
 <sub>2</sub>–O
 <sub>12</sub> were generally observed with (−)ESI; the most abundant O
 <sub>
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> classes for all the samples were O
 <sub>2</sub> and O
 <sub>4</sub>. For the solvent extracts, O
 <sub>6</sub> (for hexane extract) and O
 <sub>8</sub> (for toluene extract) were also abundant. The classes O
 <sub>11</sub> and O
 <sub>12</sub> were observed only for the solvent extracts except for a small amount of O
 <sub>11</sub> for the pine essential oil. With (+)APPI, both the hydrocarbon class (HC) and the oxygen atom classes (O
 <sub>x</sub>) were observed. A total of seven different O
 <sub>
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> class were observed (O
 <sub>1</sub>–O
 <sub>7</sub>) with (+)APPI. Unlike (−)ESI, (+)APPI also efficiently ionized compounds belonging to the O
 <sub>1</sub> class. For the essential oils, HC was the most abundant class (ca. 55–90%), whereas for the solvent extracts, O
 <sub>2</sub> was the major one. The classes O
 <sub>3</sub> and O
 <sub>4</sub> were also more abundant for the solvent extracts. Again, the highest O
 <sub>
  <italic>x</italic>
 </sub> classes (O
 <sub>5</sub>–O
 <sub>7</sub>) were only observed for the solvent extracts. For most compounds, (+)APPI produced both protonated molecules and radical cations, not evenly distributed among different compound classes observed. In some instances, these two ion types can be used to distinguish between alicyclic and aromatic compounds.

 </sup> The compound class distributions show that ESI generally ionizes more polar compounds, and does not ionize hydrocarbons or lowly oxidized nonpolar species (O
 <sub>1</sub> class); on the other hand, (+)APPI ionizes nonpolar aromatic compounds, including hydrocarbons. Thus, the use of both ESI and APPI provides complementary compositional information on the oil constituents.
