<p>In the (−)ESI FT-ICR mass spectra of conifer needle essential oils (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>
 </xref>), the peaks appeared at 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 150–600, whereas for the toluene and hexane extracts, the most abundant peaks appeared at 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 300–450, representing mostly a few resin acids as well as some other diterpenoids. For both solvent extracts, the most abundant ion was observed at 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 349.238413 and was tentatively identified as pinifolic acid methyl ester (see, discussion below). In the (−)ESI mass spectra, some nonspecific cluster ions (acid dimers) also appeared at a high 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> range. After deisotoping, declustering, and formula assignment, the number of unique monoisotopic peaks detected (at a signal-to-noise ratio of S/N ≥ 5) ranged between 1200 and 1600 in all the samples (

 </xref>). In contrast, the mass spectra measured with (+)APPI appeared less complex, with the most abundant ions mainly representing monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and other hydrocarbons (

 </xref>). As compared to (−)ESI, both odd- and even-electron ions (radical cations, M
 <sup>+•</sup>, and protonated molecules, [M + H]
 <sup>+</sup>) were generated by (+)APPI. The ion observed at 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 204.187801 was the most abundant in all the oil samples, representing different isomeric sesquiterpenes. This ion also appeared in the mass spectra of the solvent extracts but at much lower abundance. For both solvent extracts, the ion observed at 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 302.224580, tentatively identified as abietic acid, was the most abundant.
