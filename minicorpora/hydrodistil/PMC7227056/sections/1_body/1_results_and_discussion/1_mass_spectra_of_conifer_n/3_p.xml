<p>The Venn diagrams in

  <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>
 </xref> display the number of compounds present in the essential oil and solvent extracts of pine. The Venn diagrams show the number of compounds unique to each extract and the number of compounds found in all extracts, providing a visual means for sample composition differentiation. With (−)ESI, about 24% (588 molecular formulae) of the total assigned formulae were common to all, whereas with (+)APPI, 28 and 17% (249 and 98 formulae), with respect to the protonated molecules and radical cations, respectively, were common to all. More compounds were detected from the solvent extracts as compared to the essential oil. The number of compounds detected by (+)APPI was much less than the number of compounds detected by (−)ESI, except for the pine toluene extract.
