<p>Diterpene hydrocarbons, such as abietatriene, norabietatriene, and norabietatetraene, were also detected. Resin acids are used in various pharmaceutical applications to produce microcapsules and nanoparticles because of their extremely good film-forming and coating properties, whereas their parent hydrocarbons are frequently used to modify the concept of skin adhesion.

 </sup> Sesquiterpenes were present in the extracts in moderate amounts but their oxygenated derivatives were present only in minor quantities. Monoterpene hydrocarbons and their oxygenated compounds were present at low abundance as compared to the other types of terpenoids present in both samples, possibly because of their high volatility.
