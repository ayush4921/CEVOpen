 </xref>), was the most abundant acid present in both solvent extracts. Pinifolic acid and its methyl ester were also present in significant amounts. Other resin acids that were efficiently ionized by (+)APPI include dehydroabietic acid, dehydropinifolic acid, isocupressic acid, and anticopalic acid. Diterpene hydrocarbons and diterpenoids were also found in the solvent extracts. Isoabienol, a labdane alcohol (a main diterpene alcohol present in Scots pine needles
