<p>APPI ionizes both polar and nonpolar compounds and is less sensitive to ion suppression effects than ESI; thus, it is less selective toward certain compound types, for example, acids. Therefore, the combination of both ionization methods provides complementary data on essential oils and plant extracts. In this work, (+)APPI analysis targeted nonpolar species and it preferentially ionized terpene hydrocarbons and their derivatives. For all the essential oils (

 <italic>z</italic> 205.195077, representing different sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (C

 <italic>Pinus canariensis</italic> and 
 <italic>Pinus pinaster</italic>, and the second most abundant to monoterpenes.

 </sup> A peak representing monoterpenes (
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 137.132464) was also observed in the (+)APPI spectra of all the essential oils. A variability of terpene hydrocarbons may be attributed to many factors, including climate, geographical location, harvesting season, genotype, and also the extraction technique used.
