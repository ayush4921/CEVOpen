 <sub>1</sub> (either borneol, citronellal, eucalyptol, linalool, caraneol, or a mixture of those) was distinct to the juniper and spruce oils. Oxygenated compounds, such as pinocarvone, thymol and its methyl ether, carvacrol, verbenone, thujone, and piperitone, have been reported to occur in conifer species.

 </sup> Oxygenated sesquiterpenes were more abundant than the oxygenated monoterpenes. The reports have shown that caryophyllene oxide, germacrene-4-ol, nootkatone, nerolidol, farnesol, nerolidol, and levomenol are among the most abundant sesquiterpernoids in conifer needle essential oils.

 </sup> Sesquiterpenoids showed higher abundance in spruce oil as compared to the other oils, and were less abundant in the solvent extracts. The amount of diterpenoids was exiguous as compared to monoterpene and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons in all the four samples. These results agree well with the previous reports.

 </sup> Cembrene, abietal, abietadiene, abietatriene, ferruginol, isopimarol, and dehydroabietal are common diterpenoids in essential oils.

 </sup> Phenylpropanoids were present at low abundance among all the compounds. Esters, except sesquiterpenoid esters, were present also at low abundance. The complete list of the compounds detected in the essential oils with (+)APPI is given in
