<p>Unlike by (−)ESI, hydrocarbons were efficiently ionized by (+)APPI (

 </xref>). The most abundant species in the essential oils are mono- and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons. They can be seen at O/C = 0 and H/C ≥ 0.5 in the VK diagrams. In addition, many species could be seen around O/C ≈ 0.05–0.1 and H/C ≥ 1, which likely represent different terpenoids. Some resin and fatty acids were also present in the region O/C ≈ 0.1–0.3 and H/C ≈ 1.3–2.3 but there were only a few compounds with high intensity in this region. For all the essential oils, esters were present at low relative intensity, around O/C ≈ 0.1–0.2 and H/C ≈ 1.3–1.5. Diterpenoids (resin acids and their derivatives) were the most dominant compounds in both solvent extracts. The next most abundant were terpene hydrocarbons and then oxygenated terpenes.
