<p>A van Krevelen (VK) diagram is a plot of the atomic H/C versus X/C ratio (where X is a heteroatom, e.g., oxygen) for each detected compound and, thus, a straightforward means for the visualization of complex mass spectrometric data. One can use VK diagrams to have an overall view on the chemical composition of a given sample and to compare different samples. In the VK diagrams of the (−)ESI FT-ICR spectra of the essential oils (

 </xref>), the O/C ratio varied between 0 and 0.7, whereas the solvent extracts had a slightly wider range of O/C ≈ 0–1. The most abundant species were centered around O/C ≈ 0.1–0.3 and H/C ≥ 1.5. This is a typical region for lipids (fatty acids, resin acids, diterpenoids). There were no considerable differences between the four essential oil samples. In contrast, the both solvent extracts had generally more condensed (lower H/C) and more oxygenated (higher O/C) species, consistent with compound class distributions (

The pine hexane extract also had a few highly abundant species at high O/C ratios (O/C ≈ 0.6–1.0) and H/C ≥ 1.3, representing carbohydrates, whereas the toluene extract had only a few of these compounds at low intensities. Flavonoids were also present around O/C ≈ 0.3–0.5 and H/C ≈ 0.6–1.2 at low intensities in both solvent extracts.
