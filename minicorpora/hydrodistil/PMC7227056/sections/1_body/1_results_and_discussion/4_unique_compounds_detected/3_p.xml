<p>Citronellic acid, palmitic acid, oleic acid, and stearic acid were the most abundant fatty acids present in the essential oil samples. In addition, resin acids were detected as well. Abietane-type resin acids were more abundant than the labdane-type resin acids except in the juniper oil. Some of the resin acids tentatively identified were abietic acid, pinifolic acid and its monomethyl ester, isocupressic acid, and anticopalic acid. To the best of our knowledge, these compounds have not been reported in the literature to be present in the essential oils of these plant species, albeit in their organic solvent extracts. Some acidic compounds were unique to certain samples; coumaric acid was present only in pine and spruce. An earlier study reported the presence of this compound in the callus resins of pine and spruce.

 </sup> In addition, 3-methylbutanoic acid was only detected in the pine oil. The ion with the molecular formula of C
 <sub>10</sub>H
 <sub>16</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> was most likely geranic acid (3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienoic acid), a polyunsaturated fatty acid that has been reported to be a tyrosinase inhibitor.

 </sup> This monoterpenoid was detected at high abundance for all the samples except for the larch oil. Another class of compounds, which was present in all the samples, were phenylpropanoids, which are known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities.

 </sup> They were present at low abundance in all the samples. Eugenol, methyl eugenol, and safrole are the examples of phenylpropanoids that are present in conifer species.
