<p>The major compounds detected in the essential oil samples with (−)ESI were different acids, esters, and alcohols. Many acidic compounds present in all the four samples have not been reported earlier. The complete list of the putative compounds and their elemental formulae are given in 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.0c00901/suppl_file/ao0c00901_si_001.pdf" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Table S1</ext-link>. As (−)ESI preferentially ionizes polar (acidic) compounds, terpenes or terpenoids present in the oil samples were not efficiently ionized or were detected at very low abundance.
