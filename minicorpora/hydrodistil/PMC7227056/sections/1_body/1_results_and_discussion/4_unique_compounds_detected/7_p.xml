<p>Phenolic compounds such as phenolic acids, flavonoids, and lignins were also tentatively identified. Phenolics are a class of secondary metabolites with a different chemical nature. Phenolic acids identified in the extracts were quinic acid, benzoic acid, salicylic acid, and ferulic acid (present only in the toluene extract). An earlier study identified quinic acid in Scots pine needles.
