<p>A few flavonols (quercetin, isorhamnetin, kaempferol, taxifolin) were present at very low abundance in the toluene extract but were absent in the hexane extract. A study by Oleszek et al. identified quercetin and taxifolin in the needles of Scots pine from Brazil.

 </sup> Lignins, which are phenolic compounds that contain dimers of phenylpropane, were present only in the toluene extract. Hydroxymatairesinol, matairesinol, and nortrachelogenin were tentatively identified; these compounds have been previously reported in the knot and stem wood of Scots pine.

 <italic>z</italic> 371.119456 and

 <italic>z</italic> 513.269973, respectively) but these compounds were detected at low abundance in the toluene extract only. Low-molecular-weight carbohydrates, such as arabinose, glucose, rhamnose, raffinose, and pinitol, were also present in the extracts. These compounds were first isolated from Scots pine needles by Assarsson et al.
