<p>A homologous series of long-chain fatty acids, ranging from C
 <sub>12</sub> to C
 <sub>32</sub>, were also tentatively identified in the extracts. Both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids were observed. In the hexane extract, the most abundant homolog of these fatty acids was Î±-linolenic acid, which agrees with the results reported by Makarenko et al.

 </sup> In contrast, the most abundant fatty acid in the toluene extract was palmitic acid; this is in line with the fatty acid composition of 137 gymnosperm species reported by Mongrand et al.

 </sup> Other fatty acids identified in the extracts were oleic acid, linoleic acid, tridecanoic acid, and myristic acid. A few hydroxy fatty acids were also detected at very low abundance with 16-hydroxypalmitic acid (juniperic acid) as the most abundant compound in this group. A homologous series of monoglycerides were also identified in the extracts. These monoglycerides have been reported in common juniper.
