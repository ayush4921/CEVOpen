Given the nonpolarity of the solvents used, the extracts were dominated by lipophilic compounds, for example, resin acids, free fatty acids, diterpenyl alcohols, diterpenyl aldehydes, sitosterols, and phenolic compounds. The major constituents in both toluene and hexane extracts were resin acids and the most abundant compounds were the labdane-type secondary metabolites. The compounds found in these two extracts were quite similar. The most abundant compound in both was methyl pinifolate (C

 <italic>z</italic> 349.238396), a monomethyl ester of pinifolic acid (13

 </sup> Pinifolic acid was reported as early as 1962 by Enzell and Theander
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref100">100</xref>
 </sup> and was shown to be highly enriched in pine needles (âˆ¼65% of the acid fraction of the needle acetone extract). A major portion of pinifolic acid has been reported to exist as its monomethyl ester.

 <italic>z</italic> 319.227841. Another labdane-type acid, imbricatolic acid (also known as dihydroisocupressic acid), was present at moderate intensity. This compound was first reported as a natural compound in 
 <italic>Pinus elliottii</italic>(
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref>) and it has since then been reported in several conifer species. Basas-Jaumandreu et al. reported it as the most abundant compound found in the extract of
