<p>The other classes of resin acids present in the solvent extracts were abietane and the pimarane-type resin acids. As these two types of acids are structural isomers, their differentiation is impossible without chromatographic separation. However, some studies have shown that abietic-type diterpenoids are more dominant in Pinaceae species
