<p>The compounds were tentatively identified by comparing their assigned molecular formulae with the compounds already identified by using other conventional methods. Furthermore, public databases (ChemSpider, ChEBI, PubChem, etc.) were searched to find putative candidates. Only naturally occurring compounds were considered and the original articles were inspected for previously reported structures. As no mass spectrometer can differentiate between isomeric compounds of the same chemical formula, unless hyphenated with chromatographic (GC, LC) or ion mobility separation or by the use of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), the analysis is typically limited to the compound class level, unless a very specific elemental formula arises. In many cases, however, some unique compounds are highly enriched over the other (isomeric) constituents, allowing more confirmatory assignments without chromatographic separation. Structures of some selected compounds detected in the essential oil samples by both (âˆ’)ESI and (+)APPI are shown in
