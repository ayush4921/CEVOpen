<p>All essential oil samples were analyzed on a 12-T Bruker solariX XR FT-ICR mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, Germany), equipped with a dynamically harmonized ICR cell (Paracell) and an Apollo-II atmospheric pressure ion source (serving both ESI and APPI). For the (−)ESI measurements, 10 μL of each sample was diluted with 190 μL of methanol. The samples were directly infused into the ion source at a flow rate of 2 μL/min using a syringe pump. For the (+)APPI measurements, 10 μL of each sample was diluted with 90 μL methanol and 10 μL toluene (serving as a dopant). For the APPI measurements, the flow rate was increased to 4 μL/min. Dry nitrogen was used as the drying (4.0 L/min, 220 °C) and nebulizing gas (0.8 bar). The mass spectra were first calibrated externally by using either sodium trifluoroacetate clusters

 </sup> (for ESI) or APCI-L Tuning Mix (part no. G1969-85010; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) (for APPI). Compass ftmsControl software was used for the data acquisition and the mass spectra were further processed and analyzed with DataAnalysis 5.0 software (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, Germany). A total of 300 time-domain transients (8 Mword each) were co-added and zero-filled once prior to full-sine apodization, fast Fourier transform, and magnitude calculation. For the peak picking, the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio was set at 5.0 and the relative intensity threshold was 0.01%. For the molecular formula assignment, the parameters were as follows: DBE, 0–80; mass error, ≤1 ppm; maximum number of formulae, 50; elemental formula,
