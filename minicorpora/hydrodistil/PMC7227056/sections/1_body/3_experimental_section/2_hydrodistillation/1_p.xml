<p>The hydrodistillation device was assembled using a Clevenger apparatus and a condenser. Briefly, 100 g of needles was placed into a 500 mL round-bottom flask with 150 mL of distilled water and subjected to hydrodistillation for 3 h. The separated essential oil was then stored in the refrigerator for further analysis. For simplicity, the obtained essential oils are referred to as “pine oil”, “spruce oil”, “larch oil”, and “juniper oil”.</p>
