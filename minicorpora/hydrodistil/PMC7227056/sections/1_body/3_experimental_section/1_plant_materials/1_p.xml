<p>Branches of pine (
 <italic>P. sylvestris</italic>) and spruce (
 <italic>P. abies</italic>) were collected in April, and the branches of juniper (
 <italic>J. communis)</italic> and larch (
 <italic>L. decidua</italic>) were collected in June from the Ylä-Valtimo region, Eastern Finland, and stored in a cold room (at 4 °C) to avoid the loss of volatile components. The needles were picked out of the branches and cut into pieces for hydrodistillation or solvent extraction. All the solvents used were obtained from VWR Chemicals (Darmstadt, Germany) and they were of HPLC grade.
