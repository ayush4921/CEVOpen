<p>Solvent extraction of pine needles was carried out with a Buchi extraction system B-811 (BÃœCHI Labortechnik AG, Flawil, Switzerland). Hexane and toluene were used for the extraction. For each extraction experiment, 20 g of pine needles were cut and placed into the small sample tube, screwed onto the condenser tube. Of the solvent, 100 mL was poured into the solvent cup. During the heating of the solvent, a lower temperature was used for hexane as compared to toluene because of the higher boiling point of toluene. The solvent was then evaporated to dryness. The extraction time was 2 h 30 min for both solvents.</p>
