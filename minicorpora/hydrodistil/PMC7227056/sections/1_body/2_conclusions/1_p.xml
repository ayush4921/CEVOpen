<p>In this work, high-resolution FT-ICR mass spectrometry, combined with (−)ESI and (+)APPI was successfully used for direct chemical fingerprinting of essential oils and solvent extracts obtained from four conifer tree species. Based on the results, conifer needles possess a rich chemistry which differs considerably from that of the sap/heart wood. Some compounds are only found in the needles and may be present in high quantities (e.g., pinifolic acid and its derivatives). Whereas (−)ESI targeted mainly both the polar constituents of the oils, including different acids, esters, alcohols, and phenolic compounds, (+)APPI targeted more preferentially the nonpolar compounds, especially terpene hydrocarbons. The hydrodistillation process resulted in the extraction of most volatile constituents, whereas organic solvents extracted the more resinous part of the plant. All the main compounds identified were predominant in all the four essential oil samples although their relative abundances varied considerably. Resin acids were dominated by labdane- and abietane-types of compounds. Other detected compounds included different carbohydrates, flavanols, and lignans. Some of the detected compounds possess considerable bioactivity and may serve as potential ingredients in different nutritional or health products. In conclusion, a direct-infusion ultrahigh-resolution FT-ICR MS serves as a powerful technique for nontargeted analysis of complex organic mixtures, like plant extracts and essential oils, capable of detecting even thousands of compounds in a single run without chromatographic separation.</p>
