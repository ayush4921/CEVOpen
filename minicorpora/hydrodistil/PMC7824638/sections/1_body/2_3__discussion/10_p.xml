<p>The search for new therapeutic drugs requires conditions that simulate the environment found by the parasiteâ€“cell interaction, therefore, the assay against intracellular amastigote forms of tripanosomatids may represent ideal conditions, with macrophages playing an important role in the evaluation of drug-mediated toxicity [
 <xref rid="B34-antibiotics-10-00024" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Thus, it was evaluated whether 
 <italic>A. rosaeodora</italic> essential oil and linalool could inhibit 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> intracellular amastigote. However, the inhibitory effect was observed only when infected cells were treated with linalool although in high concentration, while 
 <italic>A. rosaeodora</italic> essential oil presented activity at an even higher concentration.
