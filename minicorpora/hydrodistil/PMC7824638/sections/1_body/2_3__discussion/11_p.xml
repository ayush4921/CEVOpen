 <italic>Piper aduncum</italic> essential oil (PaEO), with nerolidol (25.22%) and linalool (13.42%) as main constituents, effectively inhibits the intracellular survival/replication of T. cruzi amastigotes. PaEO at a concentration of 12.5 µg/mL decreased the rate of T. cruzi amastigote infection by 71.5%, with an IC
 <sub>50</sub>/24 h of 9 µg/mL. As linalool showed trypanocidal activity, with IC
 <sub>50</sub>/24 h of 306 ng/mL against trypomastigotes [

 <italic>Croton cajucara</italic> essential oil, the number of parasites internalized in the macrophages decreased (treated before and after the interaction). On the other hand, no cytotoxic effects of essential oil and linalool were observed in peritoneal macrophages of Swiss mice and Vero cells [

 <italic>A. rosaeodora</italic> essential oil and linalool not exhibited cytotoxicity against peritoneal macrophages in the concentration range under analysis. As a result, linalool showed a select activity to the parasites when compared to mammalian cells [
