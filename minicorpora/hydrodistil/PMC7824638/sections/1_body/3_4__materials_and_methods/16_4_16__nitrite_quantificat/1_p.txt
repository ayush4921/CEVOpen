0: BALB/c peritoneal macrophages (5  10 6 cells/mL) was treated with  A. rosaeodora essential oil (500 g/mL) or linalool (250 g/mL), and either stimulated or not stimulated with  T. cruzi trypomastigotes (5  10 7 parasites/mL) for 48 h. Nitrite quantification of the supernatant of the cells was performed with Griess reagent.
1: Briefly, 50 L of culture supernatant and 50 L of Griess reagent (25 L of sulfanilamide 1% in 2.5% H 3PO 4 solution and 25 L of N-(1-naphthyl)-ethylenediamine 0.1% solution) were added in 96-well plates.
2: After incubation in a dark environment for 10 min, absorbance was obtained at 570 nm on the spectrophotometer.
3: The nitrite values were obtained from the standard curve of sodium nitrite (1001.5 M) [ 51].
