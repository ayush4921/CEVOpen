0: Antioxidant activity was assessed using a reaction mixture of 2,2-azinobis- (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) at 3840 g/mL with 88 L of 37,840 g/mL potassium persulfate solution left in the dark at room temperature for 16 h giving rise to the ABTS radical which was diluted in ethanol to obtain an absorbance of 0.7 to 734 nm.
1: The results were obtained in a dark environment, in which 30 L of each concentration of essential oil (200 to 15 g/mL) and eugenol (90 to 5 g/mL) was transferred in test tubes containing 3.0 mL of the cation radical ABTS and homogenized on a tube shaker, and after 6 min the absorbance of the reaction mixture was read on a spectrophotometer at a length of 734 nm [ 43].
2: The analyses were carried out in triplicates and the determination of the activity was demonstrated as percentage of inhibition (% I) of the ABTS radical cation according to the equation: % inhibition = (absorbance of the solution of the radical ABTSabsorbance of the sample)/(solution of ABTS absorbance radical)  100 [ 44].
3: We also verified the efficient concentration or EC50% that represents the concentration necessary to sequester 50% of the ABTS root.
4: The essential oil will be considered active when it has an EC50< 500 g/mL [ 45].
