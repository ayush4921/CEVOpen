0: Parasite cultures employed in this study were  Trypanosoma cruzi (SC2005 strain).
1: Trypomastigote forms were obtained from Vero cells infected and used to infect the macrophages.
2: Epimatigote forms were originated from the suspension of cell culture trypomastigotes in 3 mL of liver infusion tryptose (LIT) medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/mL of penicillin and 100 g/mL of streptomycin), and incubated in an oven at 28 C until complete differentiation of parasites.
