0: BALB/c peritoneal macrophages cultured in 24-well plates (5  10 5 cells/well), with coverslips, were infected with trypomastigote forms of  T. cruzi, obtained from cultured Vero cells, using the ratio of parasite/cell 10:1, at 37 C and 5% CO 2 for 6 h. After incubation, well plates were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2) to remove the non-internalized parasites.
1: The infected cells were treated with different concentrations of  A. rosaeodora essential oil or linalool (100031.25 g/mL), or benzonidazole (1006.25 g/mL) for 24 h. The amastigotes couting by analysis of light microscopy were carried out to determine the IC 50 calculation.
2: Selectivity index were obtained from the relationship of macrophage cytotoxicity and antiamastigote activity.
3: Parameters of infection analysis were performed according to Teles et al.
4: [ 50].
