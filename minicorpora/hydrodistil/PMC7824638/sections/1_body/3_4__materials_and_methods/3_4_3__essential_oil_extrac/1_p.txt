0: The extraction of the essential oil of  A. rosaeodora was carried out with 100 g of dried leaves from thin branches diluted in water in the proportion of 1:10 by hydrodistillation using the Clevenger system for 3 h at 100 C. The essential oil collected were dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate (Na 2SO 4) and the final volume found was used to determine the yield through the mass/volume ratio by measuring the density.
1: Mass/volume ratios were calculated from the mass (g) of the initial vegetal material and the volume (mL) of essential oil obtained after extraction.
2: The essential oil samples were kept at 25 C and then weighed.
3: For the verification of biological activity in vitro, the essential oil and the reference drugs were diluted in DMSO and subsequently made serial dilutions in an appropriate culture medium until reaching a final concentration below 1% DMSO.
