0: Peritoneal macrophages (5  10 5 cells/mL) were cultured in 96-well plates with different concentrations, obtained by serial dilutions (1:2), of  A. rosaeodora essential oil or linalool (10007.8 g/mL) or benznidazole (2000.78 g/mL) up to a final volume of 100 L per well.
1: The controls were categorized as blanks (wells with culture medium without cells), untreated control (cells and DMSO 1%) and reference drug (benznidazole).
2: After 72 h, the cell viability was analyzed by the MTT colorimetric method [ 48].
3: Absorbance was measured in a spectrophotometer at 540 nm wavelength.
4: The concentration inhibiting 50% of cell growth (CC 50) was calculated following the formula: CC 50 = (sample absorbance-blank absorbance)/(control absorbance-blank absorbance)  100 [ 49].
