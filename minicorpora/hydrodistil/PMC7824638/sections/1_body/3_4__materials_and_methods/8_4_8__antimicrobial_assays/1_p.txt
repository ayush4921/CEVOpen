0: During the preliminary test of diffusion in solid medium, 100 L of inoculum of each bacterium sown on MuellerHinton agar plates were used, and on the agar surface, a paper disc impregnated with 50 L of essential oil of  A. rosaeodora, standard linalool or reference drugs were added; then the plates were incubated at 35 C and after 24 h the inhibition zone was measured with a millimeter rule [ 42].
1: The MIC was also performed according to the broth dilution methodology performed in triplicate with the same bacteria used in the diffusion tests in solid medium [ 41].
2: Initially, serial dilutions were performed resulting in concentrations of 51000 g/mL of  A. rosaeodora essential oil, linalool or reference drugs and transferred to a test tube containing Mueller-Hinton broth.
3: To each concentration, 100 L of the microbial suspension containing 1.5  10 8 CFU/mL were added and subsequently incubated at 35 C for 24 h. It was also reserved control of broth sterility and bacterial growth.
4: After the incubation period, the MIC was determined, being defined as the lowest concentration that visibly inhibited bacterial growth (absence of visible turbidity).
5: To confirm growth inhibition, the broth was subjected to the microbial seeding test of the inoculum on the surface of the plate-count agar.
