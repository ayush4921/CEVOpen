0: Epimastigote forms of  T. cruzi, from a 2- to 4-day-old culture were incubated for 24 h in the absence or in the presence of different concentrations (100015.625 g/mL) of  A. rosaeodora essential oil or linalool, obtained by serial dilutions (1:2), at a final volume of 100 L per well.
1: The controls were identified as blank (wells without parasites), untreated control (parasites and DMSO 1%) and reference drug (benznidazole).
2: Incubation took place in a 96-wells plate, in a BOD incubator at 28 C in LIT medium using a parasite concentration of 10 6 promastigotes/mL.
3: After 24 h, with the aid of the Neubauer chamber and light microscopy [ 46], viability was evaluated by counting parasites and the results were used to calculate the IC 50 (50% inhibition of parasite growth) following the formula: IC 50 = (sample counting)/(control counting) 100 [ 47].
