<p>The nitrite quantification in the supernatant of BALB/c peritoneal macrophages showed low nitrite levels in cells treated with 
 <italic>A. rosaeodora</italic> essential oil (0.150 ± 0.220 μM NaNO
 <sub>2</sub>, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0259) and linalool (0.175 ± 0.146 μM NaNO
 <sub>2</sub>, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0490) when compared to untreated-unstimulated cells (1.129 ± 0.501 μM NaNO
 <sub>2</sub>). In 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic>-stimulated cells, although nitrite levels after treatment with 
 <italic>A. rosaeodora</italic> essential oil (0.952 ± 0.779 μM NaNO
 <sub>2</sub>) and linalool (1.047 ± 0.702 μM NaNO
 <sub>2</sub>) were lower than stimulated-untreated cells (1.347 ± 0.416 μM NaNO
 <sub>2</sub>), the difference was not statistically significant for both compounds (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.945 and
