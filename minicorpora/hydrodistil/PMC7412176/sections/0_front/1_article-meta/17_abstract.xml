 <p>Essential oil (EO) and hydrosol (HL) isolated from an indigenous plant species 
  <italic>Satureja hellenica</italic> were evaluated against 
  <italic>Meloidogyne incognita</italic> and 
  <italic>M. javanica</italic>. Particularly, the activity of extracts on a second stage juvenile’s (J2s) motility, the hatching of J2s from eggs, egg differentiation and the effect on J2s in soil were tested. A paralysis of 100% of the J2s of both species was recorded after 96 h of immersion in the essential oil, at a dose of 2000 μL/L. At the same dose, the percentage of paralyzed J2s after 48 h of immersion was more than 80%, for both 
  <italic>Meloidogyne</italic> species. The use of hydrosol has shown encouraging results only in the dilution of 50%, where for both 
  <italic>Meloidogyne</italic> species tested, the percentage of paralyzed J2s was more than 70% after 48 h of immersion, while the percentage was increased to 90% after 96 h of immersion. Egg differentiation was ceased after immersion, either in EO or HL. However, this decrease in egg differentiation was evident only at higher concentrations of EO and at the highest HL dilution (0.5 
  <italic>v</italic>/
  <italic>v</italic>). The hatching of 
  <italic>M. incognita</italic> J2s was decreasing as the dose was increasing. The lowest numbers of hatched J2s were recorded at the doses of 2000 and 4000 μL/L. A clear reduction in 
  <italic>M. javanica</italic> J2s hatching was observed as the dose was increased to 250 μL/L, a fact constantly observed as the dose was increasing up to 4000 μL/L. Lower numbers of nematodes were recorded in roots grown in infested soil after the application of EO or HL at the highest doses. The EO of 
  <italic>S. hellenica</italic> is characterized by the presence of 
  <italic>p</italic>-cymene (27.46%) and carvacrol (23.25%), and in a lesser extent of other constituents, such as borneol (6.79%), carvacrol methylether (6.77%), 
  <italic>γ</italic>-terpinene (4.63%) and 4-terpineol (3.65%). Carvacrol was the major constituent found in the HL (50.12%), followed by borneol and 4-terpineol (20.42 and 6.72%, respectively).
