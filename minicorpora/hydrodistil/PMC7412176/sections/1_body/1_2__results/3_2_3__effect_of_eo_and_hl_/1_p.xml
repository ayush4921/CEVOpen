<p>The results of the effect of the essential oil on egg differentiation, as means of the two experiments, are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00856-f001">Figure 1</xref> for both species. No significant differences were recorded among the different concentrations of the EO for 
 <italic>M. incognita</italic>. However, by increasing the concentration to 250 μL/L, a significant reduction of the differentiated eggs was observed compared to the control. A different pattern was observed when 
 <italic>M. javanica</italic> was used. The essential oil substantially inhibited eggs differentiation when tested at doses of 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 μL/L. Egg differentiation was also inhibited when undifferentiated eggs were treated with lower doses of EO (125 and 250 μL/L).
