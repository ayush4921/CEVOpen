<p>The results of the effect of the essential oil on hatching inhibition, as means of the two experiments, are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00856-f003">Figure 3</xref>. The effect of the essential oil on hatching of J2s was related to different doses after 35 days exposure for both species. The hatching of 
 <italic>M. incognita</italic> J2s was decreasing as the dose was increasing. The lowest numbers of hatched J2s were recorded at the doses of 2000 and 4000 μL/L. A clear reduction in 
 <italic>M. javanica</italic> juveniles hatching was observed, as the dose was increased to 250 μL/L, a fact constantly observed as the dose was increasing up to 4000 μL/L.
