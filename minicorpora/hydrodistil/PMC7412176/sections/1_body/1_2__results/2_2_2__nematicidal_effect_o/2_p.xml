<p>The percentage of dead 
 <italic>M. incognita</italic> and 
 <italic>M. javanica</italic> J2s, as affected by the different dilutions of the hydrosol (HL), is presented in 
 <xref rid="plants-09-00856-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="plants-09-00856-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>, respectively. The hydrosol gave encouraging results only in the dilution of 0.5 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>, where for both species, the percentage of dead J2s was more than 70% after 48 h of immersion. At the same dilution, the percentage was more than 90% after 96 h of immersion for both 
 <italic>Meloidogyne</italic> species. In both nematode species, lower HL concentrations of 
 <italic>S. hellenica</italic> did not affect the motility of juveniles after immersion, either for 24 or 48 h. However, a decrease of J2s motility was observed after 96 h immersion amongst the low concentrations of the HL and the control for both 
 <italic>Meloidogyne</italic> species.
