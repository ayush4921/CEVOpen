<p>The numbers of dead 
 <italic>M. incognita</italic> and 
 <italic>M. javanica</italic> second stage juveniles (J2s), as affected by the different doses of the essential oil, are presented in 
 <xref rid="plants-09-00856-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="plants-09-00856-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, respectively. The percentage of dead J2s increased as the exposure time increased. The essential oil killed 100% of the J2s of both species after 96 h of immersion at a dose of 2000 Î¼L/L. At the same dose, the percentage of dead J2s after 48 h of immersion was more than 80%, for both 
 <italic>Meloidogyne</italic> species.
