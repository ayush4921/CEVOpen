 <xref rid="plants-09-00856-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> show the identified compounds in order of their elution from the TR-5MS capillary column, the relative retention indices (RRI), and the compounds’ relative percentages in the total composition of the EO and hydrosol. Thirty-two constituents were identified from the EO, while 18 constituents were recorded in the hydrosol. The EO is characterized by the presence of 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (27.46%) and carvacrol (23.25%), and in a lesser extent of other constituents such as borneol (6.79%), carvacrol methylether (6.77%), 
 <italic>γ</italic>-terpinene (4.63%) and 4-terpineol (3.65%). Carvacrol was the major constituent found in the hydrosol (50.12%) followed by borneol and 4-terpineol (20.42 and 6.72%, respectively).
