0: Plant parasitic nematodes are the most destructive group of plant pathogens worldwide, and their control is extremely challenging [ 1].
1: Many crops all over the world can be infested by nematodes, creating yield losses of over a billion Euros annually [ 2].
2: In the recent past years, a lot of nematicides have been widely used to suppress the root-knot nematodes (RKN) populations in vegetable production.
3: However, some nematicides, such as methyl bromide, have been banned, due to their adverse effect on the environment.
4: Nematodes management is based on cultural practices, crop rotation, resistant cultivars or root stocks and the use of a limited number of synthetic chemical nematicides.
5: However, for the ones that are still used, their repetitive application reduced their persistence and efficacy due to enhanced degradation [ 3, 4].
6: A lot of research has been undertaken to find new molecules which are effective against plant parasitic nematodes [ 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].
7: Plant derived phytochemicals can be used as pesticides themselves, or they can serve as model compounds for the agrochemical industry [ 6].
8: Towards this, plant essential oils (EOs) and their components have been repeatedly tested against sedentary and migratory endoparasitic nematodes [ 6].
9: Plants produce a set of volatile organic compounds as a defense mechanism against damage by pests and pathogens.
10: EOs are natural volatile substances extracted from a wide range of plants belonging to different botanical families.
11: Essential oils consist of a mixture of terpenoids [ 11].
12: Their chemical composition is not stable amongst the plant species and varieties, or even amongst the phenological stages of the plant.
13: Although EOs have long been investigated, not much attention has been paid to hydrosols, which are by-products derived during hydrodistillation.
14: Hydrosols derived from three Lamiaceae species showed an important adverse effect on the settling behavior of  Myzus persicae [ 12].
15: Traka et al.
16: [ 13] reported that hydrosols derived from  Ocinum basilicum and  Ruta chalepensis presented an important effect on the mortality of  Aphis gossypii and  Tetranychus urticae.
17: Terpenes constituent of EOs are responsible for the characteristic aroma and odor of each plant, because of the volatile compounds that they contain.
18: The presence of volatile terpenes provides EOs with antimicrobial, antifungal [ 14], antioxidant [ 15], insecticidal [ 16, 17] and nematicidal properties [ 18].
19: A large number of EOs and their components have been found to have nematicidal activity against pinewood ( Bursaphelenchus xylophilus) and root-knot nematodes ( Meloidogyne spp.)
20: [ 6, 19, 20].
