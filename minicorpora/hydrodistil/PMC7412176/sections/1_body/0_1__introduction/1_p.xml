<p>Plant parasitic nematodes are the most destructive group of plant pathogens worldwide, and their control is extremely challenging [
 <xref rid="B1-plants-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Many crops all over the world can be infested by nematodes, creating yield losses of over a billion Euros annually [
 <xref rid="B2-plants-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In the recent past years, a lot of nematicides have been widely used to suppress the root-knot nematodes (RKN) populations in vegetable production. However, some nematicides, such as methyl bromide, have been banned, due to their adverse effect on the environment. Nematodes management is based on cultural practices, crop rotation, resistant cultivars or root stocks and the use of a limited number of synthetic chemical nematicides. However, for the ones that are still used, their repetitive application reduced their persistence and efficacy due to enhanced degradation [

 <xref rid="B4-plants-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. A lot of research has been undertaken to find new molecules which are effective against plant parasitic nematodes [

 <xref rid="B6-plants-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Towards this, plant essential oils (EOs) and their components have been repeatedly tested against sedentary and migratory endoparasitic nematodes [
 <xref rid="B6-plants-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Plants produce a set of volatile organic compounds as a defense mechanism against damage by pests and pathogens. EOs are natural volatile substances extracted from a wide range of plants belonging to different botanical families. Essential oils consist of a mixture of terpenoids [
 <xref rid="B11-plants-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Their chemical composition is not stable amongst the plant species and varieties, or even amongst the phenological stages of the plant. Although EOs have long been investigated, not much attention has been paid to hydrosols, which are by-products derived during hydrodistillation. Hydrosols derived from three Lamiaceae species showed an important adverse effect on the settling behavior of 
 <italic>Myzus persicae</italic> [
 <xref rid="B12-plants-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Traka et al. [
 <xref rid="B13-plants-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] reported that hydrosols derived from 
 <italic>Ocinum basilicum</italic> and 
 <italic>Ruta chalepensis</italic> presented an important effect on the mortality of 
 <italic>Aphis gossypii</italic> and 
 <italic>Tetranychus urticae</italic>. Terpenes constituent of EOs are responsible for the characteristic aroma and odor of each plant, because of the volatile compounds that they contain. The presence of volatile terpenes provides EOs with antimicrobial, antifungal [

 <xref rid="B18-plants-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. A large number of EOs and their components have been found to have nematicidal activity against pinewood (
