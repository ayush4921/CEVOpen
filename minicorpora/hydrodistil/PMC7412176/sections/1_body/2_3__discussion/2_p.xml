 <italic>Satureja hellenica</italic> essential oil significantly inhibited egg differentiation. This was noticeable, even at the dose of 250 μL/L, but there was not any further increase of inhibition of 
 <italic>M. incognita</italic> eggs as the dose was increasing. When 
 <italic>M. javanica</italic> eggs were exposed to EO, a high percentage of eggs remained undifferentiated at doses of 500 to 4000 μL/L. Moreover, lower doses of EO (125 and 250 μL/L) have shown a negative effect on egg differentiation. In contrast, the use of 
 <italic>S. hellenica</italic> hydrosol was not that effective in decreasing egg differentiation, for both species. When hydrosol was tested on the differentiation of eggs, a significant decrease was observed only after increasing the dose to 0.5 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>. However, at the doses of 0.2 and 0.5 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic> in hydrosol, there was a non-significant decrease in the hatching of J2s after immersion for 28 days.
