<p>Our results show that EO at the two higher doses tested was effective in controlling J2s in soil. Additionally, the hydrosol at the dose of 0.5 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic> was effective in reducing the numbers of females in roots almost 50% compared to the untreated control. However, in field soil infested by root-knot nematodes, there is a reservoir of inoculum remaining from season to season consisted of either J2s or/and eggs free in soil, or protected inside the gelatinous matrix of the egg sac. It has been reported that nematodes’ eggs consist of three layers, which act as a barrier against nematicides penetration [

 <xref rid="B20-plants-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In our experiments, the essential oil inhibited about 85 and 59% of the juveniles from hatching, for 
 <italic>M. incognita</italic> and 
 <italic>M. javanica</italic>, respectively. Our results on hatching inhibition are in agreement with those reported by Barros et al. [
 <xref rid="B22-plants-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], who worked with EO isolated from 
 <italic>Dysphania ambrosioides</italic> having, as a constituent, 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene. Additionally, EOs from other plant species, containing 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene and carvacrol as major constituents, have been shown to inhibit nematode hatching [

 <xref rid="B24-plants-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. When hydrosol was used, the level of juveniles hatched from egg masses (58 and 49% for 
 <italic>M. incognita</italic> and 
 <italic>M. javanica</italic>, respectively) was lower than that observed in EO. The egg hatch inhibition could be due to the ability of either EO’s or HL’s to penetrate egg mass and act on nematode eggs [
