<p>It is obvious from the results of the present study that there are differences in the ratio of terpenes between the EO and the hydrosol. This could explain the differences of activity between the EO and hydrosol extracted from the same plant species. The essential oil of 
 <italic>S. hellenica</italic> is characterized by both the high presence of monoterpene hydrocarbons (MH) and oxygenated monoterpenes (OM), due mainly to the presence of 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene, and carvacrol, respectively. The group of MH did not detect the 
 <italic>S. hellenica</italic> hydrosol, while the OM occupied 93.7% of the total composition. The OM exhibited a better extraction to 
 <italic>S. hellenica</italic> hydrosol than the HM, which is explained by the hydrophobicity of the latter. The highest component in the EO is 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene, which is not present in the hydrosol. On the other hand, the highest constituent of the hydrosol is carvacrol, which is present in EO, but almost 50% lower than that in the hydrosol. Another terpene, borneol, is present in the hydrosol, almost four times more than in EO. Thymol, which is present in EO but not in hydrosol, has been reported in the literature to be active against root-knot nematodes [

 <italic>S. hellenica</italic>, either in EO or in hydrosol, are reported to have nematicidal properties, either as constituents of aromatic plant species or as isolated terpenes [

 <xref rid="B26-plants-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, based on our results, it seems that the ratio of each constituent is very important as far as nematicidal effect is concerned. Our results are in agreement with those from Ntalli et al. [
 <xref rid="B27-plants-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. They reported that the EO obtained from 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> and 
 <italic>O. dictamus</italic> contained 68.5 and 44.3% carvacrol respectively, and had a high nematicidal activity against J2s of 
 <italic>M. incognita</italic>. Laquale et al. [
 <xref rid="B28-plants-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] reported a strong action of EOs isolated from two Italian ecotypes of Monarda species. Those essential oils had as constituents, among others, 
 <italic>Î³</italic>-terpinene and 0-cymene, which are also present in 
 <italic>S. hellenica</italic>. It seems that the presence of carvacrol and 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene as components of EOs are crucial for their nematicidal activity. However, other substances, even in a lesser quantity, might act synergistically, a fact which should be tested.
