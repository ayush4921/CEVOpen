<p>This is the first study to show the toxic effect of 
 <italic>Satureja hellenica</italic> extracts against 
 <italic>Meloidogyne incognita</italic> and 
 <italic>M. javanica</italic>. The essential oil caused a strong effect against the different biological stages of either 
 <italic>M. incognita</italic> or 
 <italic>M. javanica</italic>. This study underlines the high nematicidal activity of 
 <italic>S. hellenica</italic> EO against both species tested. A high percentage of paralyzed J2s was recorded after incubating juveniles for 24, 48 and 96 h. The extracts of 
 <italic>Satureja hellenica</italic> seem to have a remarkable nematicidal activity against 
 <italic>Meloidogyne incognita</italic> and 
 <italic>M. javanica</italic>. The percentages over 80% of paralyzed J2s, either at the dose of 2000 μL/L in EO, or the dilution of 0.5 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic> in hydrosol, after exposure for 48 h suggested potential efficacy from a control point of view. Increased paralyzed J2s were recorded by increasing either the time of exposure (from 24 to 96 h) or the dose of EO. Low doses up to 250 μL/L of EO did not show substantial activity against J2s. However, as the dose was increasing, there was a constant increase in the number of J2s with paralysis. The hydrosol of 
 <italic>S. hellenica</italic> showed lower activity, and J2s paralysis was always inferior to that observed using EO. Substantial paralysis was only recorded after the immersion of J2s in 0.5 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic> dilution for 48 and 96 h.
