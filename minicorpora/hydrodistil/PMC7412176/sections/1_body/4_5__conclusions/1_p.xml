<p>In conclusion, our work showed that 
 <italic>S. hellenica</italic> extracts can control 
 <italic>M. incognita</italic> and 
 <italic>M. javanica</italic>. Our results underlined the paralysis activity against J2s, along with the inhibition of egg differentiation and hatching. However, further experimentation is necessary for the determination of the most efficient rate and dose of these extracts.
