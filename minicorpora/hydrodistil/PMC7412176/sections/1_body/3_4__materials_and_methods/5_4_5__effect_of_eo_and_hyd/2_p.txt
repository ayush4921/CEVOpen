0: Essential oil solutions, at the doses of 62.5, 125, 250, 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 L/L, and hydrosol dilutions (in distilled water, ethanol and Tween-20) at the concentrations of 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.5  v/ v, were tested on the development of eggs.
1: The solutions were prepared as previously described.
2: Distilled water was used as the control.
3: Approximately 50 eggs per well, of which 90% were undifferentiated, were exposed to either EO or HL solutions and incubated at 26  1 C. Egg suspension (0.5 mL) was pipette into each well, with equal volume of either EO or HL suspension.
4: All plates were covered with aluminum foil to avoid evaporation.
5: For monitoring egg differentiation, eggs were observed on day 0 and day 28, with the aid of an inverted microscope (Zeiss, Germany) at 100 magnification.
6: Eggs were categorized either as differentiated (fully developed juvenile) or undifferentiated (containing only cells).
7: The experiment was conducted twice and each treatment was replicated five times.
