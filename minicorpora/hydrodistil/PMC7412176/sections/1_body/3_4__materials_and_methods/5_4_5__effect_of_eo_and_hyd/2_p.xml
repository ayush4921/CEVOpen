<p>Essential oil solutions, at the doses of 62.5, 125, 250, 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 μL/L, and hydrosol dilutions (in distilled water, ethanol and Tween-20) at the concentrations of 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.5

Approximately 50 eggs per well, of which 90% were undifferentiated, were exposed to either EO or HL solutions and incubated at 26 ± 1 °C. Egg suspension (0.5 mL) was pipette into each well, with equal volume of either EO or HL suspension. All plates were covered with aluminum foil to avoid evaporation. For monitoring egg differentiation, eggs were observed on day 0 and day 28, with the aid of an inverted microscope (Zeiss, Germany) at 100× magnification. Eggs were categorized either as differentiated (fully developed juvenile) or undifferentiated (containing only cells). The experiment was conducted twice and each treatment was replicated five times.
