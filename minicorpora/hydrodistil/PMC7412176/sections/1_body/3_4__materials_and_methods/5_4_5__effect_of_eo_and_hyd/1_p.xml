<p>Eggs of the two species of nematodes were extracted from tomato (
 <italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic> cv. Belladona) roots, using the hypochlorite method [
 <xref rid="B29-plants-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The suspension of eggs was placed on a 38 μm sieve, thoroughly rinsed with tap water and collected into a 100 mL beaker. The quantification of eggs suspension was done using an inverted microscope (100×), and the adjusted suspension was used directly in the bioassays.
