0: Mature egg masses of  Meloidogyne incognita and  M. javanica were handpicked using sterilized forceps from roots free of soil.
1: Egg masses were placed in small plastic extraction trays made by six cm petri dishes.
2: Solutions of  S. hellenica essential oil (62.5, 125, 250, 500, 1000 and 2000 L/L) or hydrosol (0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.5  v/ v), initially dissolved in ethanol and brought to volume using Tween-20 in water, were added to each extracting tray to cover egg masses.
3: Egg masses were maintained for seven days, and then test solutions were removed by washing them with tap water, and placed in new extracting trays filled with clean water.
4: Extracting trays were covered with aluminum foil to avoid evaporation and placed in an incubator at 26  1 C. Hatched J2s were counted every seven days, they were discarded, and the water was substituted with fresh one.
5: The experiment was terminated when J2s did not emerge any longer, 35 days later.
6: Then, the egg masses were picked from Petri dishes, placed in a drop of water on a glass microscope slide, gently squashed between the slide and coverslip, and the number of unhatched eggs per egg mass was counted under an inverted microscope.
7: The experiment was conducted twice and each treatment was replicated five times.
