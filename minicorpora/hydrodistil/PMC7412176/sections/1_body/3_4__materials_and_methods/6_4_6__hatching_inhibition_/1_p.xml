<p>Mature egg masses of 
 <italic>Meloidogyne incognita</italic> and 
 <italic>M. javanica</italic> were handpicked using sterilized forceps from roots free of soil. Egg masses were placed in small plastic extraction trays made by six cm petri dishes. Solutions of 
 <italic>S. hellenica</italic> essential oil (62.5, 125, 250, 500, 1000 and 2000 μL/L) or hydrosol (0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.5 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>), initially dissolved in ethanol and brought to volume using Tween-20 in water, were added to each extracting tray to cover egg masses. Egg masses were maintained for seven days, and then test solutions were removed by washing them with tap water, and placed in new extracting trays filled with clean water. Extracting trays were covered with aluminum foil to avoid evaporation and placed in an incubator at 26 ± 1 °C. Hatched J2s were counted every seven days, they were discarded, and the water was substituted with fresh one. The experiment was terminated when J2s did not emerge any longer, 35 days later. Then, the egg masses were picked from Petri dishes, placed in a drop of water on a glass microscope slide, gently squashed between the slide and coverslip, and the number of unhatched eggs per egg mass was counted under an inverted microscope. The experiment was conducted twice and each treatment was replicated five times.
