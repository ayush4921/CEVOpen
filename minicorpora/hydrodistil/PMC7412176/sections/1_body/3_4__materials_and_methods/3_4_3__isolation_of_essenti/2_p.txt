0: The determination of the chemical composition of the plant isolates was achieved by gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GC-MS) technique [ 31], using a trace ultra-gas chromatographer coupled with a DSQ II Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Scientific), fitted with a TR-5MS (30 m  0.25 mm  0.25 m) capillary column (Thermo Scientific).
1: The injector and MS transfer line temperatures were set at 220 and 250 C, respectively.
2: Experimental conditions induced an oven temperature GC programmed from 60 to 250 C at a rate of 3 C/min.
3: Helium was used as the carrier gas at a 1 mL/min flow rate.
4: A quantity of 1.0 L of the diluted samples in the case of EO (1/1000 in acetone,  v/ v), or of the organic phase, were injected manually in splitless mode.
5: The MS was operating in EI mode at 70 eV; the ion source temperature was 240 C, whereas mass spectra were acquired in the scan mode for mass range 35400.
6: Tentative identification of the compounds based on the comparison of their relative retention indices and mass spectra with corresponding data was reported in the literatures and instruments databases [ 31].
7: The relative retention indices (RRI) of compounds were determined with reference to the retention times of (C 8-C 24)  n-alkanes.
8: Relative % percentages of the compounds were obtained electronically from area percentage data.
