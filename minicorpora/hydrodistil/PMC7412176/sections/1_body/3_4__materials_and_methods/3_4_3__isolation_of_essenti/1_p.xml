<p>The essential oil was isolated from air-dried leaves and flowers (in the dark, at room temperature) with hydrodistillation (HD), for 3 h in a 5 L Clevenger-type apparatus. The essential oil was dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO
 <sub>4</sub>). The hydrosol was collected in a separate glass bottle. A part of it was extracted by diethyl ether in order to isolate the volatile compounds. The organic phase was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and reduced to a final volume. Both essential oil and organic phase were stored in −18° until their analysis.
