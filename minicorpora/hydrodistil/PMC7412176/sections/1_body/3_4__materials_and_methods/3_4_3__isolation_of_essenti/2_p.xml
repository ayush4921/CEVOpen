<p>The determination of the chemical composition of the plant isolates was achieved by gas chromatography—mass spectrometry (GC-MS) technique [
 <xref rid="B31-plants-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], using a trace ultra-gas chromatographer coupled with a DSQ II Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Scientific), fitted with a TR-5MS (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) capillary column (Thermo Scientific). The injector and MS transfer line temperatures were set at 220 and 250 °C, respectively. Experimental conditions induced an oven temperature GC programmed from 60 to 250 °C at a rate of 3 °C/min. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a 1 mL/min flow rate. A quantity of 1.0 μL of the diluted samples in the case of EO (1/1000 in acetone,

The MS was operating in EI mode at 70 eV; the ion source temperature was 240 °C, whereas mass spectra were acquired in the scan mode for mass range 35–400. Tentative identification of the compounds based on the comparison of their relative retention indices and mass spectra with corresponding data was reported in the literature’s and instrument’s databases [
 <xref rid="B31-plants-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The relative retention indices (RRI) of compounds were determined with reference to the retention times of (C
