<p>The populations of 
 <italic>Meloidogyne incognita</italic> and 
 <italic>M. javanica</italic> were collected from infested tomato greenhouses in Heraklion, Crete, and subsequently reared on tomato seedlings (
 <italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic> L.) cv. Belladona in a glasshouse in Agricultural University of Athens, Greece. All the seedlings were maintained in plastic pots in controlled conditions (25 ± 2 °C, 16 h light and 8 h dark). The infestation of the seedlings took place when the plants were 6 weeks old, at the four-leaf stage. After 40 days, roots were collected from plants and washed free of soil. Eggs of 
 <italic>Meloidogyne</italic> populations were extracted using 1% sodium hypochlorite solution [
 <xref rid="B29-plants-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Second stage juveniles (J2s) were hatched in a modified Baremann funnel, where eggs were placed. The J2s used in all tests were less than 2 days old.
