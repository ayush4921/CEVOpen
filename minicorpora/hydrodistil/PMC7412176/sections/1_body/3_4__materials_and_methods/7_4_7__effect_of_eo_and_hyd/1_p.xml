<p>The efficacy of 
 <italic>S. hellenica</italic> EO and HL against 
 <italic>M. javanica</italic> were evaluated using tomato seedlings, cv Belladonna. Seedlings at the four-leaf stage grown in soil were collected from a greenhouse at Gargaliani village, Peloponnese. Soil was autoclaved to kill any plant parasitic nematodes. Essential oil solutions, at the doses of 62.5, 500, 1000, and 4000 μL/L, and hydrosol dilutions (in distilled water) at the concentration of 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.5

 <italic>v</italic>, were tested on J2s in soil. Five plastic pots were filled with the treated soil, and 1 mL of a suspension containing 500 J2s was used for inoculation. Pots were covered with aluminum foil to avoid water evaporation and maintained at 25 ± 1 °C for 24 h to make sure that juveniles came into contact with the chemicals. Then, a tomato seedling (cv Belladonna) at the four-leaf stage was transplanted in the center of each pot. All plants were placed in a growth room at 25 ± 1 °C and 28 days later were uprooted, stems were removed, and roots were gently washed free of soil. Roots were stained using acid fuchsin, as described in Byrd et al. [
 <xref rid="B32-plants-09-00856" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] Roots were then washed in water and placed in vials containing equal volumes of glycerol and distilled water. Female nematodes were counted in the whole root system of each plant using a stereoscopic microscope at 12.5× magnification. All treatments were replicated five times, while the experiment was conducted twice.
