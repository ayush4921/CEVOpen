0: The efficacy of  S. hellenica EO and HL against  M. javanica were evaluated using tomato seedlings, cv Belladonna.
1: Seedlings at the four-leaf stage grown in soil were collected from a greenhouse at Gargaliani village, Peloponnese.
2: Soil was autoclaved to kill any plant parasitic nematodes.
3: Essential oil solutions, at the doses of 62.5, 500, 1000, and 4000 L/L, and hydrosol dilutions (in distilled water) at the concentration of 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.5  v/ v, were tested on J2s in soil.
4: Five plastic pots were filled with the treated soil, and 1 mL of a suspension containing 500 J2s was used for inoculation.
5: Pots were covered with aluminum foil to avoid water evaporation and maintained at 25  1 C for 24 h to make sure that juveniles came into contact with the chemicals.
6: Then, a tomato seedling (cv Belladonna) at the four-leaf stage was transplanted in the center of each pot.
7: All plants were placed in a growth room at 25  1 C and 28 days later were uprooted, stems were removed, and roots were gently washed free of soil.
8: Roots were stained using acid fuchsin, as described in Byrd et al.
9: [ 32] Roots were then washed in water and placed in vials containing equal volumes of glycerol and distilled water.
10: Female nematodes were counted in the whole root system of each plant using a stereoscopic microscope at 12.5 magnification.
11: All treatments were replicated five times, while the experiment was conducted twice.
