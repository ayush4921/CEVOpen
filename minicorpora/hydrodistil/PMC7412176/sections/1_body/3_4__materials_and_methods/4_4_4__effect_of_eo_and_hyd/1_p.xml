<p>Cellstar flat bottom 24-well plates were used for all in vitro tests. Solutions of 
 <italic>S. hellenica</italic> essential oil were tested for J2 motility at the doses of 62.5, 125, 250, 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 μL/L. The essential oil was dissolved in ethanol (Sigma-Aldrich; Italy) and serially diluted in distilled water containing Tween-20, to produce test solutions of the above doses. The ethanol and Tween-20 concentrations (1 and 0.3%, respectively) were tested in preliminary tests, which showed no effect on nematodes. The hydrosol dilutions (in distilled water) tested for J2s motility were 1% (0.01), 2% (0.02), 5% (0.05), 10% (0.1) 20% (0.2) and 50% (0.5) (

Juveniles’ suspension (0.5 mL) and an equal volume of either EO or HL suspension were pipette into each well. All plates were covered with aluminum foil and incubated at 26 ± 1 °C. J2s observation was conducted using an inverted microscope (100×), after 24, 48 and 96 h incubation time. The juveniles were scored as motile or dead after 10 s observation and robbing their body with a needle. If there was a lack of movement, the J2s were considered to be paralyzed. Each experiment was conducted twice, and every treatment was replicated five times.
