0: Cellstar flat bottom 24-well plates were used for all in vitro tests.
1: Solutions of  S. hellenica essential oil were tested for J2 motility at the doses of 62.5, 125, 250, 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 L/L.
2: The essential oil was dissolved in ethanol (Sigma-Aldrich; Italy) and serially diluted in distilled water containing Tween-20, to produce test solutions of the above doses.
3: The ethanol and Tween-20 concentrations (1 and 0.3%, respectively) were tested in preliminary tests, which showed no effect on nematodes.
4: The hydrosol dilutions (in distilled water) tested for J2s motility were 1% (0.01), 2% (0.02), 5% (0.05), 10% (0.1) 20% (0.2) and 50% (0.5) ( v/ v).
5: Distilled water was used as a control.
6: Approximately 35 J2s were used per treatment well in the plates.
7: Juveniles suspension (0.5 mL) and an equal volume of either EO or HL suspension were pipette into each well.
8: All plates were covered with aluminum foil and incubated at 26  1 C. J2s observation was conducted using an inverted microscope (100), after 24, 48 and 96 h incubation time.
9: The juveniles were scored as motile or dead after 10 s observation and robbing their body with a needle.
10: If there was a lack of movement, the J2s were considered to be paralyzed.
11: Each experiment was conducted twice, and every treatment was replicated five times.
