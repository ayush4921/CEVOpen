 <p>Small hive beetle (
  <italic>Aethina tumida</italic> Murray), indigenous to Africa, has spread to other parts of the world where has become a threat to the honeybee industry. In the present study, insecticidal properties (contact, fumigant, and repellent toxicities) of three main constituents derived from 
  <italic>Trachyspermum ammi</italic> (L.) Sprague ex Turrill fruits essential oil were evaluated against adult small hive beetles under laboratory conditions. The Hydrodistillation of 
  <italic>T. ammi</italic> fruits, grown in Ethiopia, yielded a pale yellow essential oil (3.5% 
  <italic>v</italic>/
  <italic>w</italic>) with a strong aromatic odor. Analyses by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry identified twenty-two compounds that accounted for 98.68% of the total essential oil. The essential oil was dominated by monoterpenoids, comprising γ-terpinene (32.72%), 
  <italic>p</italic>-cymene (27.92%), and thymol (24.36%). The essential oil showed strong contact and fumigation toxicities against the small hive beetle adults, with a LD
  <sub>50</sub> value of 66.64 µg/adult and a LC
  <sub>50</sub> value of 89.03 mg/L air, respectively. Among the main constituents, thymol was the most toxic component found in both contact (LD
  <sub>50</sub> = 41.79 µg/adult) and fumigation (LC
  <sub>50</sub> = 52.66 mg/L air) toxicities. The other two components, γ-terpinene and 
  <italic>p</italic>-cymene, were less effective in both contact and fumigant toxicities testing. The results showed that 
  <italic>T. ammi</italic> essential oil and thymol could serve as potential alternatives to synthetic insecticides for the control of small hive beetle adults.
