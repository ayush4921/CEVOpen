0: Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of the essential oil was performed on an Agilent 7890B Gas Chromatography system (Agilent Technologies, USA) coupled to an Agilent 5977A Mass Spectrometer Detector system (Agilent Technologies).
1: The HP5-MS type capillary column (a non-polar column; 30 m x 0.25 mm id and 0.25 m film thickness, Agilent Technologies) was employed to separate and analyze individual constituents.
2: Then, 1 l of diluted sample (1/100;  v/v, essential oil in acetone) was injected into the split mode with a 1:20 split ratio.
3: The gas chromatographic conditions were carrier gas helium (1.0 mL/min), initial oven temperature 40 C for 3 min isothermal, 40 to 150 C at a rate of 6 C/min, and 150 to 320 C at a rate of 10 C/min, and then held for 3 min.
4: The injector temperature was set to 270 C. Mass spectra were scanned in the range 40 to 500 amu with EI mode (70 eV) in full scan mode.
5: The percentage composition of essential oil was calculated using the peak normalization method.
6: The essential oil constituents were identified by comparing their retention indices (RI), mass spectra with NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology), Adams library spectra, Wiley 7 n.1 mass computer library, and in published literature [ 30, 31].
