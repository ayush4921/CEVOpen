<p>Small hive beetles (
 <italic>Aethina tumida</italic>) were reared in acrylic cages (38 × 38 × 34 cm) in the insectaria at the Insect Ecology Laboratory, Andong National University (ANU). The colony was maintained at 25 ± 2 °C, 60% ± 10% RH, and 12 L:12 D photoperiod on pollen dough. On preliminary testing, no significant differences between male and female responses of SHB were found with test samples (
