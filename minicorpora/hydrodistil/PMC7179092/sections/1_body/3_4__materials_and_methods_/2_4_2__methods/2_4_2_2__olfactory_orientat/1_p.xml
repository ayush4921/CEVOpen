<p>A Y-tube olfactometer system, previously described by Li et al. [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-25-01100" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], was used to test the orientation responses of SHB towards test samples (essential oil, γ-terpinene, 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene, and thymol, each 1.25 ppm in acetone, separately) and control (acetone). The Y-tube olfactometer (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-01100">Figure S3</xref>) was comprised of a central tube and two lateral arms (each 8 cm long and 18 mm internal diameter). Each arm was connected to an odor chamber (cryogenic vial, 4.3 cm in height and 3.0 cm inner diameter, 20 mL) holding the test sample. Each odor chamber had inlets for the incoming air and outlets for odors to exit the Y-tube. A charcoal-filtered and humidified air stream was passed into each arm at a flow rate of 250 mL/min (DK-800 air pump) to allow experimental odors to move towards the decision-making area. A mesh screen was placed at each of the endpoints of the olfactometer to prevent SHBs from escaping or coming in direct contact with the test samples. Small hive beetles, of either sex, were starved for over 2 h, before being tested. The test samples were separately applied to pieces of cotton. A 10 µl aliquot of each test samples was dripped onto a piece of cotton that had been placed inside one arm, and another piece of cotton permeated with 10 µl of acetone was placed in the other arm of the Y-section as a control. To prevent any positional bias in the behavior of the SHB, the relative position of the tested stimulus and its corresponding control were alternated between replicates. A clean Y-tube was used for each test in order to avoid carryover of odors. The Y-tube was illuminated with red light by means of an incandescent light bulb to preclude their use of visual cues during the experiments. One SHB at a time was introduced into the Y-tube after the airflow had been initiated. It was assumed to have made a choice when the SHB walked more than 2/3 the length of the treated source or control arm and stayed there for approximately 1 min or when it frequently visited the arm. A ‘‘no choice’’ decision was recorded if the SHB had not moved after 5 min. Each treated or control cotton was used only once and, then, was replaced with a fresh cotton for the next individual, and each individual SHB was used only once in the experiment. A total of 50 SHB were used for individual test samples. Response rate (%) and repulsion rate (%) of test samples on SHB in the Y-tube olfactometer were computed using a formula reported by Li et al.
