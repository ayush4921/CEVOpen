0: Contact toxicity of the essential oil from  T. ammi fruits and its three main constituents (-terpinene,  p-cymene, and thymol) were evaluated against the small hive beetle adults by topical application method, as described by Park et al.
1: [ 49] with a few modifications ( Figure S3).
2: Preliminary studies were carried out to determine the appropriate test range concentrations.
3: After SHB adults were cold anesthetized, aliquots of 1 l of the test samples (20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 g/SHB) were applied topically to the ventral abdomen of adult beetle using a microsyringe with repeating dispenser (Hamilton, Reno, NV, USA).
4: Acetone (1 l) was used as a control.
5: After topical application of test samples, adult SHB were placed in a plastic Petri dish (1.5 cm in height and 5 cm diameter) with a piece of cotton containing honey solutions (ca.
6: 0.5 mL of 5% ( v/v) honey solution) and covered with a lid which had mesh-hole (1.4 cm diameter), thereby preventing fumigant effect of the tested samples.
7: A total of 300 SHBs were used for each concentration with 5 adult SHBs per treatment in 10 replications.
8: After 24 h treatment, mortality was checked.
9: The LD 50 values were calculated by using Probit analysis.
