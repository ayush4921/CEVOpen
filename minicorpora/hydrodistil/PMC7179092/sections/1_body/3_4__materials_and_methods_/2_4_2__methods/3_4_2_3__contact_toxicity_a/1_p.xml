<p>Contact toxicity of the essential oil from 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic> fruits and its three main constituents (γ-terpinene, 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene, and thymol) were evaluated against the small hive beetle adults by topical application method, as described by Park et al. [
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-25-01100" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] with a few modifications (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-01100">Figure S3</xref>). Preliminary studies were carried out to determine the appropriate test range concentrations. After SHB adults were cold anesthetized, aliquots of 1 µl of the test samples (20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 µg/SHB) were applied topically to the ventral abdomen of adult beetle using a microsyringe with repeating dispenser (Hamilton, Reno, NV, USA). Acetone (1 µl) was used as a control. After topical application of test samples, adult SHB were placed in a plastic Petri dish (1.5 cm in height and 5 cm diameter) with a piece of cotton containing honey solutions (ca. 0.5 mL of 5% (
 <italic>v/v</italic>) honey solution) and covered with a lid which had mesh-hole (1.4 cm diameter), thereby preventing fumigant effect of the tested samples. A total of 300 SHBs were used for each concentration with 5 adult SHBs per treatment in 10 replications. After 24 h treatment, mortality was checked. The LD
 <sub>50</sub> values were calculated by using Probit analysis.
