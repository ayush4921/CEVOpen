<p>Fumigant toxicity of the essential oil and its three main constituents were also evaluated according to Park et al. [
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-25-01100" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] with a few modifications. The test was carried out using a plastic cylinder (6.5 cm in height and 3.5 cm inner diameter, 65 mL) containing a cryogenic vial (4.3 cm in height and 3.0 cm inner diameter, 20 mL) with mesh-holes at the bottom, and fitted approximately 2 cm above the bottom of the plastic cylinder (

A paper disk (8 mm, Advantech) was impregnated with 10 µL of test sample solution. Disks were left to dry for 10 min to allow for acetone evaporation prior to being placed in the bottom lid of the cylinder. As a negative control, acetone (10 µL) only was applied. The top and bottom lids were sealed using parafilm to prevent leaking. Five adults per treatment were placed in a sieve with pollen dough (ca. 11 g), thereby preventing their direct contact with the test plant oils and compounds. The insects were maintained at 25 ± 1 °C and 80% relative humidity. After 24 h treatment, the insects and the pollen dough were moved to a new plastic Petri dish (4 cm in height a nd 9.6 cm diameter) and covered with a lid which had mesh-hole (4 cm diameter) for 10 min. The adult beetles were considered dead if their appendages did not move after air blown using an aspirator (Bug-Vac, Rose Entomology, AZ, USA). All treatments were replicated 5 times.
