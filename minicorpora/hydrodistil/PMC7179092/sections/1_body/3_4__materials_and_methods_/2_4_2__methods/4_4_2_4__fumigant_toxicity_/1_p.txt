0: Fumigant toxicity of the essential oil and its three main constituents were also evaluated according to Park et al.
1: [ 49] with a few modifications.
2: The test was carried out using a plastic cylinder (6.5 cm in height and 3.5 cm inner diameter, 65 mL) containing a cryogenic vial (4.3 cm in height and 3.0 cm inner diameter, 20 mL) with mesh-holes at the bottom, and fitted approximately 2 cm above the bottom of the plastic cylinder ( Figure S3).
3: All test samples solutions were prepared in acetone at a concentration Ranging from 20 to 100 mg/L air.
4: A paper disk (8 mm, Advantech) was impregnated with 10 L of test sample solution.
5: Disks were left to dry for 10 min to allow for acetone evaporation prior to being placed in the bottom lid of the cylinder.
6: As a negative control, acetone (10 L) only was applied.
7: The top and bottom lids were sealed using parafilm to prevent leaking.
8: Five adults per treatment were placed in a sieve with pollen dough (ca.
9: 11 g), thereby preventing their direct contact with the test plant oils and compounds.
10: The insects were maintained at 25  1 C and 80% relative humidity.
11: After 24 h treatment, the insects and the pollen dough were moved to a new plastic Petri dish (4 cm in height a nd 9.6 cm diameter) and covered with a lid which had mesh-hole (4 cm diameter) for 10 min.
12: The adult beetles were considered dead if their appendages did not move after air blown using an aspirator (Bug-Vac, Rose Entomology, AZ, USA).
13: All treatments were replicated 5 times.
