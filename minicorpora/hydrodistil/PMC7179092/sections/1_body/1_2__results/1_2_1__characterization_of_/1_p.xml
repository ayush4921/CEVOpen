<p>Hydrodistillation of the fruits of 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic> grown in Ethiopia gave a pale yellow essential oil, which was characterized by a strong aromatic odor with percentage yield of 3.5% (
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic>, on a dry basis). The essential oil yield harvested in Ethiopia was consistent with the oil yield (2.0% to 4.4%) reported elsewhere [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-25-01100" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The GC–MS analysis of the essential oil resulted in the identification of twenty-two compounds, representing 98.68% of the total essential oils (

 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (27.92%), and thymol (24.36%) (

 <italic>T. ammi</italic> essential oil from Ethiopia was characterized by a high level of γ-terpinene (γ-terpinene chemotype). However, the Indian 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic> essential oil was dominated by relative high amounts of thymol (39.1%) (thymol-chemotype), followed by 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (30.8%), and γ-terpinene (23.2%) [
