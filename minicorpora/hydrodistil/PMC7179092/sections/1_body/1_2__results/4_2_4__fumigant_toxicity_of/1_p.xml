<p>A similar profile of fumigant toxicity, such as contact toxicity, was observed when the essential oil of 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic> was subjected to fumigant activity against SHBs, with a LC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 89.03 mg/L air (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-01100-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-01100-f003">Figure 3</xref>). It is noteworthy that thymol, among the main constituents, exhibited a strong fumigant activity against SHBs with a LC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 52.66 mg/L air, followed by Î³-terpinene (522.11 mg/L air). 
 <italic>p</italic>-Cymene was found to be the least toxic compound to SHBs, with a LC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 1027.69 mg/L air. Therefore, the fumigant activity of 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic> essential oil (EO) has been attributed to the thymol compound present in the essential oil.
