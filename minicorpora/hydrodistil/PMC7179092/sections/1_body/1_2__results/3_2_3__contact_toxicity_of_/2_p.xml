<p>Among the main components, thymol proved to be the most effective in its contact toxicity activity, with a LD
 <sub>50</sub> value of 41.79 µg/adult. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-01100-f002">Figure 2</xref>, thymol had a positive dose-contact mortality response to SHBs with concentration. However, the other two, γ-terpinene and 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene, were less effective and achieved only LD
 <sub>50</sub> values of 424.02 and 1208.71 µg/adult, respectively.
