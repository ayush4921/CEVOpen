<p>The results of contact mortality assays are presented in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-01100-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The results showed that the contact toxicity of 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic> essential oil and its major components, γ-terpinene, 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene, and thymol against SHB adults varied. The essential oil showed a dose-dependent contact mortality, achieving 72% at the highest tested dose (100 µg/adult) (

 <sub>50</sub> = 66.64 µg/adult), the main constituents of the essential oil were investigated for their contact toxicity.
