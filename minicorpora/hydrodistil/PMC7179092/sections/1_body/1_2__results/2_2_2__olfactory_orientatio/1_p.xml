<p>Olfactory orientation assays of SHBs were conducted on odors of test samples in a dual-choice test using Y-tube, with a design similar to that reported by Li et al. [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-25-01100" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Under red light, when SHBs were presented as a choice between 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic> essential oil (treated arm) and acetone (control), they walked quickly back and forth between the arms, until the majority of SHB settled down at the far end of the control arm of the Y-tube. Individual SHB made a choice within the first minute. There was a significant difference in response of the repulsion of SHB when they were exposed to a choice between the odor of 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic> essential oil and the control (
 <italic>X</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 13.863, df = 3, and 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.003). Indeed, 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic> essential oil had a repulsion rate of 74% Â± 2.45% (
