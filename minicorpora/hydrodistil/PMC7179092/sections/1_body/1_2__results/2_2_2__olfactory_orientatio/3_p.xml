<p>No significant repulsion response of SHBs was observed when SHB were presented a choice between Î³-terpinene and the control in a dual Y-tube olfactory assay (

 <sup>2</sup> = 3.452, df = 4, and 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.485) (

 <italic>p</italic>-cymene and the control (

 <sup>2</sup> = 0.680, df = 2, and 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.712) (

 <italic>T. ammi</italic> essential oil was a repellent to the SHBs, only due to the presence of thymol in the essential oil.
