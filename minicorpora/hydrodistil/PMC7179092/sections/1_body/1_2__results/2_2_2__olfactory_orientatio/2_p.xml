<p>Following the repulsive response of 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic> essential oil, the three main constituents were tested for their response toward SHBs. Thymol, one of the main components of 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic> essential oil, showed a strong repulsion response (78% ± 3.74%) toward SHBs as compared with the control (
 <italic>X</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 13.863, df = 5, and 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.017). It was also interesting to note that there was no significant difference in the repulsion rate of SHBs when they were presented with the odor of 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic> essential oil and thymol (
 <italic>X</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 3.314, df = 2, and 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.191). However, arithmetically, SHB’s repulsion rate to thymol tended to be higher than the 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic> essential oil.
