<p>From the present study, the insecticidal toxicities of 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic> essential oil seem to be mainly attributed to the presence of thymol. Owing to the fact that 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic> can be easily cultivated, has high essential oil yield, and the other two major compounds (Î³-terpinene and 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene) can be chemically converted into thymol via aromatization and hydroxylation reactions, respectively, this would make 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic> essential oil a suitable candidate for the commercial development of a plant-derived insecticide.
