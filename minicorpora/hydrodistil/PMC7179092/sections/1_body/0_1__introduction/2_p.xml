<p>The small hive beetle, 
 <italic>A. tumida</italic> (Coleoptera: Nitidulidae), indigenous to Africa, has spread to other parts of the world where it has become a serious pest of honeybee colonies [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-25-01100" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Adults and larvae of the small hive beetle primarily feed on brood, honey, and pollen, but can also cause fermentation and spoiling of the honey [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-25-01100" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. It is now understood that small hive beetles utilize volatiles emanating from the fermented pollen or honey, from adult worker bees (
 <italic>Apis mellifera</italic> Linnaeus), or other hive materials that allow them to locate honeybee colonies [
