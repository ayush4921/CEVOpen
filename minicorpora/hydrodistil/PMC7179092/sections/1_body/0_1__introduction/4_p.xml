<p>Essential oils are well documented to show a broad spectrum of activity against pest insects, ranging from insecticidal, antifeedant, repellent, oviposition deterrent, growth regulatory, and antivector activities [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-25-01100" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. One plant essential oil that falls under this category is from 
 <italic>Trachyspermum ammi</italic> (Bishopâ€™s weed). The essential oil of 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic> was reported to be one of the most effective plant extracts commonly used for control against 
 <italic>Zabrotes subfasciatus</italic> (Mexican bean weevil) [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-25-01100" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], 
 <italic>Sitophilus zeamais</italic> (maize weevil) [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-25-01100" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and 
 <italic>Bactrocera oleae</italic> (olive fruit fly) [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-25-01100" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Indeed, these insecticidal activities of the essential oil were mainly attributed to the presence of thymol. Thymol is also a major constituent of some essential oils from 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-25-01100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], 
 <italic>Carum copticum</italic> [

 <italic>Satureja</italic> spp. [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-25-01100" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and other medicinal plants. In fact, thymol is known to possess various biological activities including antibacterial and antifungal activities [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-25-01100" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], acaricidal properties [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-25-01100" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], nematicidal activity [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-25-01100" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and insecticidal [
