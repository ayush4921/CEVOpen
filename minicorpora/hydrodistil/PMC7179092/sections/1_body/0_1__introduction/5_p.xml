<p>To our knowledge, few studies on insecticidal activity of plant extracts against the small hive beetles (SHBs) have been reported. In addition, the essential oil of 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic> fruits and its main constituent have not been evaluated against small hive beetles. In the present investigation, we characterized the chemical composition of essential oil extracts from 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic> fruit, and evaluated the insecticidal properties (contact, fumigant, and repellent toxicities) of its three main constituents against the small hive beetle, 
 <italic>Aethina tumida</italic>.
