0: The small hive beetle,  A. tumida (Coleoptera: Nitidulidae), indigenous to Africa, has spread to other parts of the world where it has become a serious pest of honeybee colonies [ 4].
1: Adults and larvae of the small hive beetle primarily feed on brood, honey, and pollen, but can also cause fermentation and spoiling of the honey [ 5].
2: It is now understood that small hive beetles utilize volatiles emanating from the fermented pollen or honey, from adult worker bees ( Apis mellifera Linnaeus), or other hive materials that allow them to locate honeybee colonies [ 6, 7].
