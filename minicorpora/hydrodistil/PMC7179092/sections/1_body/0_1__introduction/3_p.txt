0: The small hive beetle was first detected in Miryang-si South Korea, in 2016 [ 8].
1: However, SHBs invasion pathway to Korea was not clear until 2019.
2: Recently, the origin of the SHB population in Korean has been linked to southeast USA [ 9].
3: Two control measures are commonly used for SHB in the United States, i.e., coumaphos strips that are placed inside the hive [ 10, 11, 12] and an insecticide soil drench that is applied to the soil surrounding the outside of the hive [ 12, 13].
4: However, the use of these types of non-selective synthetic pesticides have been shown to have adverse effects on living organisms and the environment [ 14, 15].
5: Thus, alternatives to traditional chemical treatments, such as botanical pesticides including essential oils that have lower mammalian and environmental toxicity, are being evaluated.
