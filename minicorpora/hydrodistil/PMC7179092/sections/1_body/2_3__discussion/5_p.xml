<p>The percentage composition of the main constituents of the essential oil from 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic> grown in Ethiopia varied from those growing elsewhere. It was characterized by a high content of γ-terpinene of Ethiopian origin (Trachyspermum ammi ct. γ-terpinene), while it was dominated by thymol in India (
 <italic>Trachyspermum ammi</italic> ct. thymol) [

 <italic>T. ammi</italic> is grown in Ethiopia at 1700 to 2200 m altitude, whereas, it grows on the hills of Southeast Asia, at 750 m altitude [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-25-01100" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In fact, the present study demonstrated that thymol is still one of the major constituents of 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic> essential oil grown in Ethiopia, which accounts for 24.36% of the total essential oil.
