<p>Dahlgren et al. [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-25-01100" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] showed that twenty-four hours after exposure, honeybees (both queens and workers) were more tolerant of thymol than conventional pesticides, with LD
 <sub>50</sub> values of 3240 μg/g (583.2 μg/queen bee, queens) and 524 μg/g (56.6 μg/worker bee, workers). While taking this data into consideration [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-25-01100" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], honeybee queens and workers were found to be 14-fold and 1.4-fold more tolerant of thymol, respectively, than SHBs as compared with per adults. Moreover, several thymol-based formulations have been used to control varroa mite and well tolerated by the bees [

 <xref rid="B42-molecules-25-01100" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] demonstrated that the small hive beetle (SHB) was selectively susceptible to several classes of insecticides when subjected to the glass-vial bioassays. Coumaphos (LC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.61 μg/vial), which is currently used for control of SHB populations, was found to be less toxic to adult SHBs than fenitrothion (LC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.53 μg/vial), chlorpyrifos (LC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.53 μg/vial), and methomyl (LC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.54 μg/vial) [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-25-01100" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In a previous report [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-25-01100" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], thymol was found to be very effective in control of mites (
 <italic>Varroa jacobsoni</italic>) at a concentration between 5 and 15 μg/L air. Therefore, thymol can be considered as an agent worthy of being used in control of both mites and adult SHBs.
