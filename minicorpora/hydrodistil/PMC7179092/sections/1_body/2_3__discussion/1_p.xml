 <italic>Trachyspermum ammi</italic> fruits are traditionally used, in Ethiopia, to control pests. The insecticidal toxicities of 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic> essential oil appear to be linked to its chemical constituents. The toxicity studies which are described here provide strong evidence that the insecticidal property of 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic> essential oil to SHBs is attributed to the presence of thymol, which accounts for approximately 24.36% of the total essential oil (contact mortality LD
 <sub>50</sub> = 41.79 μg thymol/adult and fumigant toxicity LC
 <sub>50</sub> = 52.66 mg thymol/L air). It is interesting to note that thymol has also been reported to be toxic to several pests, effective to 
 <italic>Musca domestica</italic> (housefly) and 
 <italic>Spodoptera litura</italic> (tobacco cutworm) (LD
 <sub>50</sub> = 25.4–29.0 μg/insect) [

 <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (common fruit fly) and northern house mosquito,

 <italic>T. ammi</italic> and thymol dosages (100 mg/L air) resulted in significantly higher numbers of dead wandering larvae of SHBs in fumigation toxicity as compared with their controls. Therefore, we have ruled out thymol as an agent to control SHB’s larvae.
