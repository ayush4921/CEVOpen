0: Analyses were performed using a HP 6890 gas chromatograph coupled with a HP 5973 mass spectrometer detector.
1: An autosampler unit (HP 7673100 positions) was used to perform the 1 L injections.
2: Separation was accomplished with a HP-5MS column (30 m by 0.25 mm, i.d., 0.25 m phase thickness).
3: Operating conditions were as follows: injector: split ratio 25:1; temperature: 250 C; carrier gas: helium, 1.0 mL/min, constant flow; column temperature, 60 C (no hold), 5 C per minute then @ 280 C hold for 4 min.
4: MS was acquired at 70 eV using a mass scan range of 45300  m/ z. Quantification was based on the peak areas on the chromatogram generated by MS data (total ion chromatogram).
5: Integration parameters were set to exclude peak areas less than 0.5%.
