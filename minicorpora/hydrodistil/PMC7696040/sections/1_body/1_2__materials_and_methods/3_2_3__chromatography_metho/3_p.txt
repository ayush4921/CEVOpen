0: Most identification of essential oil components was performed by comparison of mass spectra with the NIST electronic library database [ 15] and confirmed using calculated retention indices relative to n-alkanes, then compared to published values.
1: A second library in the form of a book by Adams [ 16] was used to resolve any further discrepancies with identification.
2: Most samples were injected once only, accept in cases of unusual or unexpected chemical profiles.
3: These samples with repeats include the ROA replicates, the LAIA repeats, OVA, BEM, COA, CAA and ULN.
4: Some of the components were identified by isolation (10% ethyl acetate, 90% hexane, normal phase column chromatography using silica gel) and comparison of respective  13C NMR spectra to published values, using a 500 MHz Bruker Avance (Germany) spectrometer in  d-chloroform.
5: These were; prostantherol, ledol, cis-dihydroagarofuran, maaliol, globulol, epiglobulol and kessane, which were also authenticated in previous studies by matching  13C NMR spectra to published values [ 17, 18, 19, 20, 21].
6: A snapshot of the  13C NMR spectrum for each of these sesquiterpenes is provided as  Figures S1S8 in Supplementary Files.
