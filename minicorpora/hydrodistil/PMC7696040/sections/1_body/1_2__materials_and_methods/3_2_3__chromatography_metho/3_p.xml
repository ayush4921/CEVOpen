<p>Most identification of essential oil components was performed by comparison of mass spectra with the NIST electronic library database [
 <xref rid="B15-plants-09-01570" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and confirmed using calculated retention indices relative to n-alkanes, then compared to published values. A second library in the form of a book by Adams [
 <xref rid="B16-plants-09-01570" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] was used to resolve any further discrepancies with identification. Most samples were injected once only, accept in cases of unusual or unexpected chemical profiles. These samples with repeats include the ROA replicates, the LAIA repeats, OVA, BEM, COA, CAA and ULN. Some of the components were identified by isolation (10% ethyl acetate, 90% hexane, normal phase column chromatography using silica gel) and comparison of respective 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra to published values, using a 500 MHz Bruker Avance (Germany) spectrometer in 
 <italic>d</italic>-chloroform. These were; prostantherol, ledol, cis-dihydroagarofuran, maaliol, globulol, epiglobulol and kessane, which were also authenticated in previous studies by matching 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra to published values [
