<p>Analyses were performed using a HP 6890 gas chromatograph coupled with a HP 5973 mass spectrometer detector. An autosampler unit (HP 7673–100 positions) was used to perform the 1 μL injections. Separation was accomplished with a HP-5MS column (30 m by 0.25 mm, i.d., 0.25 μm phase thickness). Operating conditions were as follows: injector: split ratio 25:1; temperature: 250 °C; carrier gas: helium, 1.0 mL/min, constant flow; column temperature, 60 °C (no hold), 5 °C per minute then @ 280 °C hold for 4 min. MS was acquired at 70 eV using a mass scan range of 45–300
