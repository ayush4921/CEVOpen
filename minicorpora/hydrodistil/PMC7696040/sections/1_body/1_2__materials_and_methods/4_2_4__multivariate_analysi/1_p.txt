0: Percentage compositions of the essential oil components were used as input data to perform a hierarchical clustering analysis (HCAbp) with bootstrap resampling in the software R 3.4.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria), using the pvclust [ 22] package, the wards clustering algorithm and Euclidean distance.
1: Prior to multivariate analyses, raw data were scaled by the arcsine method in accordance with previous reports for data expressed as percentages [ 23, 24].
2: Two types of support values were plotted in the HCAbp using 10,000 replicates: traditional bootstrapping (bp) and approximately unbiased (au)  p-values.
