<p>Essential oils were produced using hydrodistillation. Approximately 600 g of fresh leaf was removed from the twig then cut into 0.5 mm fragments and placed into a 5 L round bottom flask with 2.5 L of deionised distilled water (ddH
 <sub>2</sub>O). Leaves were heated for 3–4 h using continuous cohobation of hydrosol. Afterwards the steam/oil mix was collected from the 1000 mL separating funnel after separating from the hydrosol. Essential oils were stored away from light at 4 °C until used.
