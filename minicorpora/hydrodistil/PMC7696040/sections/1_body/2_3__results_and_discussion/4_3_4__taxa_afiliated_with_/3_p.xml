<p>The dataset also conveys some degree of geographical chemical convergence of species that are clearly distinct taxa according to morphology. This has also been observed in South American taxa [
 <xref rid="B40-plants-09-01570" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. For example, the closest chemical relative to ULN-1, according to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01570-f003">Figure 3</xref> branch D2, is COA-1, which were collected &lt;150 km apart. While COA-1 has a published and accepted name (i.e., 
 <italic>P. cotinifolia</italic>), ULN-1 was recognised by Althofer but a revision was never published.
