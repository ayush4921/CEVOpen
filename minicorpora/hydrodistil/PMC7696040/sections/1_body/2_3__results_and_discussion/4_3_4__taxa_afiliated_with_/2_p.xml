<p>The current study constitutes the first chemical analysis of essential oil from 
 <italic>P.</italic> sp. Blue Mountains (BEM), 
 <italic>P.</italic> sp. Barren Mountain (BNM, above) and 
 <italic>P. cotinifolia</italic> (
 <xref rid="plants-09-01570-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Despite the strong morphological similarity of BNM and BEM the chemical character of essential oils displays minimal overlap of major components, with only 1,8-cineole in common. As previously mentioned, the prostantheral + ledol composition of BNM makes it comparable to 
 <italic>P. petraea</italic> (
 <xref rid="plants-09-01570-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01570-f006">Figure 6</xref>), which contrasts with BEM that is comprised by nearly 50% of 
 <italic>Z</italic>-dihydroagarofuran. The globulol-rich essential oil of 
 <italic>P. cotinifolia</italic> was the most like the actual 
 <italic>P. rotundifolia</italic>, but the comparison is still poor. This is because variation within 
 <italic>P. rotundifolia</italic> was pronounced, i.e., kessane was present in two specimens only, epiglobulol in one specimen that also had nearly 30% globulol, compared to traces in the other two. Furthermore, ledol was the dominant sesquiterpene in one and prostantherol another. This pronounced chemical variation of hydroazulenic and hydronapthalenic scaffolds was realised by Southwell and Tucker (globulol vs. viridiflorol) during the course of their study of 
 <italic>P. lanceolata</italic> [
 <xref rid="B17-plants-09-01570" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This pronounced chemical variation is also evident in the dendrograms of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01570-f002">Figure 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01570-f003">Figure 3</xref>. However, what is surprising is that the cluster that includes many representatives of the 
 <italic>P. rotundifolia</italic> aggregate in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01570-f003">Figure 3</xref> (branch D2), including ROA-1, -2a, and -2b; LAIA-1 and -2; ULN-1; and the 
 <italic>P. cineolifera</italic> specimens.
