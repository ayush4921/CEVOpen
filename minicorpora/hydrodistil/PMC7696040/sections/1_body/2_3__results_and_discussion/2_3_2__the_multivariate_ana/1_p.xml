<p>The dendrogram provided as 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01570-f002">Figure 2</xref> conveys a high degree of taxonomic agreement, but it is evident that chemical variability within taxa is sometimes greater than variability across taxa, creating overlap. The chemotypes and plasticity in the 
 <italic>P. lasianthos</italic> heterogeneous aggregate were explained in a previous study [
 <xref rid="B8-plants-09-01570" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], which are thought to relate to soil type and/or drainage vs. moisture retention. Similar plasticity is evident for the specimens of the current study.
