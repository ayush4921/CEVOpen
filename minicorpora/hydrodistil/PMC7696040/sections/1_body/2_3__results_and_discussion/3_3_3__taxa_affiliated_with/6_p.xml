<p>A comparison of the chemical character of 
 <italic>P. lanceolata</italic> essential oil with that of the actual 
 <italic>P. ovalifolia</italic> (OVA-1) conveys a noteworthy difference. Surprisingly, 
 <italic>P. ovalifolia</italic> expresses an essential oil that is moderately sesquiterpene deficient (
 <xref rid="plants-09-01570-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Furthermore, the presence of borneol, bornanone (camphor) and bornyl acetate makes it relatively unique, comparable only to 
 <italic>P. latifolia</italic> (LAIA-1a and -1b), which is another of the forgotten species. The convergence of their chemical profiles is evident in the dendrograms of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01570-f002">Figure 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01570-f003">Figure 3</xref>. The earlier botanist George Bentham (1800–1884) regarded 
 <italic>P. latifolia</italic> (Benth.) Domin as a variety of 
 <italic>P. ovalifolia</italic> (i.e., 
 <italic>P. ovalifolia</italic> var. 
 <italic>latifolia</italic> Benth.) but its status at species rank is obvious in the light of modern taxonomy. Nevertheless, the close chemical relationship echoes Bentham’s observation of a close morphological relationship.
