<p>The two sesquiterpene oxides kessane and 
 <italic>Z</italic>-dihydroagarofuran were distilled from 
 <italic>P. lanceolata</italic> and chemically assigned in the 1990s, but the species was identified as affiliated with 
 <italic>P. ovalifolia</italic> and determined as 
 <italic>P.</italic> sp. aff. 
 <italic>ovalifolia</italic> [
 <xref rid="B17-plants-09-01570" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Those authors observed the same variation as in the current study and proposed that different daytime temperatures may be responsible. With a greater geographic range of sampling in the current study, it is clear that geography or climate may be significant as proposed previously.
