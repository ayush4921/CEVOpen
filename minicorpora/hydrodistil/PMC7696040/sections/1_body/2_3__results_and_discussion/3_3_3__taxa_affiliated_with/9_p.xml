<p>The etymology of 
 <italic>P. cineolifera</italic> is evidently related to the cineole content. As previously mentioned, chemistry of 
 <italic>P. cineolifera</italic> was the first of the 
 <italic>Prostanthera</italic> to be published [
 <xref rid="B30-plants-09-01570" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], which was more than a 100 years ago, but not the first to be studied. As mentioned by the author of that earlier study, Bosisto had examined 
 <italic>P. lasianthos</italic> and 
 <italic>P. rotundifolia</italic> but saw no commercial potential. Due to the taxonomic revisions since that time it is impossible to know of the actual identities of the specimens examined by Bosisto but our data (
 <xref rid="plants-09-01570-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) include a specimen of 
 <italic>P. rotundifolia</italic> (ROA-2a) that is chemically very similar to 
 <italic>Eucalyptus globulus</italic> Labill. [
 <xref rid="B33-plants-09-01570" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], which was something that Bosisto had plenty of already.
