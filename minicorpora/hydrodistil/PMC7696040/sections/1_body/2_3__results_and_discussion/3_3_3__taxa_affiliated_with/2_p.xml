 <italic>Prostanthera</italic> [
 <xref rid="B29-plants-09-01570" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], the highly aromatic foliage of 
 <italic>P. lanceolata</italic> (LAA) expresses a significant amount of essential oil, with yields ranging from 0.5 to 2.0% g/g fresh leaves (
 <xref rid="plants-09-01570-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). This species was the most represented out of the species of the current study, which was sampled 13 times. With four replicates of LAA-12, this gives 16 total specimens with characterised essential oils (
 <xref rid="plants-09-01570-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Unsurprisingly, even with multiple replicates from the one location (LAA-12: New England NP) a degree of chemical variation is evident between individuals. As previously mentioned, the intra-specific chemical variability within 
 <italic>P. lanceolata</italic> is characterised by the profiles of kessane and 
 <italic>Z</italic>-dihydroagarofuran (
