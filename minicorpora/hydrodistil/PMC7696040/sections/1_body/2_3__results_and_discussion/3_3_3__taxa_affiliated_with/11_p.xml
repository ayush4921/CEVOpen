<p>The final species that is conditionally mistaken for 
 <italic>P. ovalifolia</italic> is 
 <italic>P. prunelloides</italic> R.Br., but it is not considered affiliated as strongly as other taxa. This is another species that displays strong variation in leaf shape. A specimen found growing on Mt Dangar of the Hunter Valley region (PRS-1, Sandy Hollow) was misidentified as 
 <italic>P. ovalifolia</italic> and when we resampled it the reasoning became clear. In higher altitudes the leaves become narrow and elongate but maintain the undulation of leaf margins characteristic of the typical specimen. This contrasts with the spherical shape of leaves on specimens in the surrounding plains. Similar to the effects observed on 
 <italic>P. lanceolata</italic> (LAA), morpohological variation may be related to root anchoring. Mature specimens of 
 <italic>P. prunelloides</italic> in the lowlands are found adjacent to sandstone boulders that serve as ‘root runners’ for the species, conserving moisture and insulating against the hot sun to conserve the shallow root systems of the species. These same specimens were those sampled by Penfold almost a hundred years earlier.
