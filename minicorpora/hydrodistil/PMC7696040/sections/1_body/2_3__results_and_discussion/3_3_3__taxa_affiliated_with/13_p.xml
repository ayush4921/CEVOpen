<p>During field work in 2012 to collect samples for the current study, the Mt Dangar specimen of 
 <italic>P. prunelloides</italic> was found growing adjacent to 
 <italic>E. myoporoides</italic> (
 <italic>P. myoporoides</italic>). Similarly, 
 <italic>P. cineolifera</italic> (CIA-2) was also found growing with 
 <italic>E. myoporoides</italic> at Wingen Maide NR. On both occasions, we sampled 
 <italic>E. myoporoides</italic> to isolate the maaliol reported by Hellyer [
 <xref rid="B33-plants-09-01570" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], but failed to detect any after both attempts. Hence, the most probable explanation is that Hellyer had incorrectly identified Penfoldâ€™s collection. This was one of two errors in that paper, which will be explained in the next section.
