<p>Nevertheless, the study of 
 <italic>P. cineolifera</italic> was possibly motivated by its widespread use as a fly repellent. At the time, it did not have a taxonomic rank, so the authors characterised the species and the essential oil in the same study, but did not describe any fly repellent compounds. However, in the current study, chemical analysis of three specimens (CIA-1–CIA-3) identified moderate amounts of β-caryophyllene oxide (2.4–7.3%; 
 <xref rid="plants-09-01570-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), which is a potent mosquito repellent [
 <xref rid="B34-plants-09-01570" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and may also be a fly repellent. Due to the high yield of volatiles of this species, a moderate relative percentage of β-caryophyllene oxide effectively gives a high net yield, making this observation plausible. However, the combination of β-caryophyllene oxide and prostantherol in the profile serves as a useful diagnostic chemical criterion for this taxon, which is supported by the separate clade branching in
