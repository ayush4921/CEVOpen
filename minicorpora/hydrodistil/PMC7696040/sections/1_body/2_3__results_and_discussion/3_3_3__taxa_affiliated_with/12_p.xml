<p>Penfold did not publish anything specifically on 
 <italic>Prostanthera</italic> but instead he distilled essential oil from 
 <italic>P. prunelloides</italic>, kept it in his laboratory and decided not to study it any further, probably because of challenges in identifying maaliol, which was not a well-known compound at the time. In 1962, Hellyer mistook this essential oil as derived from 
 <italic>Eriostemon myoporoides</italic> DC (now 
 <italic>Philotheca myoporoides</italic> (DC) Bayly.) and claimed that, after many years of standing on a shelf in Penfoldâ€™s laboratory, the essential oil started to grow crystals that Penfold believed to be ledol, due to the similarity in shape and appearance, but they were in fact made from maaliol [

 <italic>E. myoporoides</italic> (
 <italic>P. myoporoides</italic>) much earlier, in which he correctly described the essential oil composition, declaring no traces of maaliol [
