<p>Initially, it was a challenge for us to identify 
 <italic>P. latifolia</italic> because there were two similar species within proximity to its type locality. However, after chemical characterization, we were compelled to make a closer examination of the morphology and realised that one of the taxa constitutes a new species, which we have ascribed the phrase name 
 <italic>P.</italic> sp. Barren Mountain (BNM-1, -2 and -3). This latter taxon produced an essential oil comprised by 65â€“80% of prostantherol + ledol, which is very similar to that produced by 
 <italic>P. petraea</italic> B.J.Conn. (
 <xref rid="plants-09-01570-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). Alternatively, 
 <italic>P. latifolia</italic> expresses an essential oil that includes borneol, bornanone (camphor) and bornyl acetate as previously mentioned.
