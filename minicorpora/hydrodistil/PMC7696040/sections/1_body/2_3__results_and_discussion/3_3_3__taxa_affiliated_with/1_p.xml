 <italic>Prostanthera lanceolata</italic> was first named in 1928 (Domin. Bibliotheca Botanica. Kassel: 89: 568, 1928), nearly 100 years ago, but the species has been continuously misidentified as 
 <italic>P. ovalifolia</italic>. As far as is known its distribution spans from central coast NSW, inland toward the higher altitudes of the New England region, and northwards to the coastal mountains comprising the eastern side of the NSW-Qld border; going from arid sub-zero winter climates (New England NP) to warmer humid climates, respectively. The taxonomic confusion and continuous mis-determinations may be related to the high morphological variability from juvenile to adult specimens, where the strongly incised margins of juvenile leaves can be preserved into maturity, due to the process of stunting growth caused by rocky cliffs with poor rooting support.
