<p>Nevertheless, maaliol was first identified in 1908 by an anonymous author [
 <xref rid="B36-plants-09-01570" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] in the resinous exudate of a Samoan medicinal species 
 <italic>Canarium samoense</italic> Engl., then soon after in 
 <italic>Valeriana officinalis</italic> L., but the etymology of this sesquiterpene is unclear. It was for some time believed to be synonymous with ledol and this was possibility the thinking of Penfold when he observed it in the 
 <italic>P. prunelloides</italic> essential oil. Maaliol and kessane rich essential oils are produced from the Indian ayurvedic plant 
 <italic>Valeriana jatamansi</italic> Jones ex Roxb. [

 <italic>Valeriana walichii</italic> DC also expresses a significant amount of maaliol, and specifically the maaliol content was demonstrated to contribute to antinociceptic activity by inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis [

 <italic>Prostanthera</italic>, although some amounts were identified in 
 <italic>Phebalium squamulosum</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>angustifolium</italic> Paul G. Wilson [
