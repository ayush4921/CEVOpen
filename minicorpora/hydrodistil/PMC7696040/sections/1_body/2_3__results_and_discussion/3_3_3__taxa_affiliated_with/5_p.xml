<p>In the first instance, the most southernly specimens express lower relative amounts of the two oxide sesquiterpenes, kessane and 
 <italic>Z</italic>-dihydroagarofuran. Southwell and Tucker proposed a hypothesis that the higher day time temperatures of the northern specimens favour the parallel twist conformation of 
 <italic>Z</italic>-dihydroagarofuran in the course of its biosynthesis [
 <xref rid="B17-plants-09-01570" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. They also observed differences in the expression of sesquiterpene alcohols. Our observation is that hydronapthalenic 
 <italic>Z</italic>-dihydroagarofuran and hydroazulenic kessane possibly modulate between hydronapthalenic prostantherol and hydroazulenic globulol, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01570-f001">Figure 1</xref>). However, the exact reason for this is not immediately obvious. Nevertheless, since prostantherol was only described [
 <xref rid="B18-plants-09-01570" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] a year after Southwell and Tuckerâ€™s study [
 <xref rid="B17-plants-09-01570" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] it is possible that they overlooked this.
