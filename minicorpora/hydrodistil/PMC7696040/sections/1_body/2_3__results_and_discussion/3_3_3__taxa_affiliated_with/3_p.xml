<p>By examining the comparison of closely allied species in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01570-f003">Figure 3</xref>, a distinct splitting of 
 <italic>P. lanceolata</italic> Domin is evident. One group recognises kessane as the dominant sesquiterpene oxide and globulol (branch C; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01570-f003">Figure 3</xref>) as the dominant sesquiterpene alcohol. The other group is the converse of this (branch B; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01570-f003">Figure 3</xref>). In this regard, the phrase named 
 <italic>P. sp.</italic> Blue Mountains (
 <italic>P.</italic> sp. aff. 
 <italic>rotundifolia</italic>) was placed in the high 
 <italic>Z</italic>-dihydroagarofuran branch (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01570-f003">Figure 3</xref>).
