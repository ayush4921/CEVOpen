<p>The chemical relationships of taxa in the 
 <italic>P. ovalifolia</italic> complex was re-examined using principle component analysis (PCA) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01570-f004">Figure 4</xref>), focusing on the four species. PCA clearly demonstrated a difference between 
 <italic>P. cineolifera</italic> and 
 <italic>P. ovalifolia</italic>, but also reiterates the close chemical relatedness of 
 <italic>P. ovalifolia</italic> and 
 <italic>P. latifolia</italic>. The loadings plot (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01570-f004">Figure 4</xref>B) conveys that the strongest chemical discriminators are 
 <italic>Z-</italic>dihydroagarofuran and kessane as previously discussed.
