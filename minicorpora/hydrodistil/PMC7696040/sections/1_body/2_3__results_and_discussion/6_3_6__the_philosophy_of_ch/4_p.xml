<p>Chemotypes can be created by the phenomenon of phenotypic plasticity [
 <xref rid="B8-plants-09-01570" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], where expression patterns and levels of volatiles are influenced by several environmental factors, including aridity or moisture retention in soils, the frequency of ephemeralism (short vs. long wet and dry cycles) and so forth. However, usually the identity and pattern of phenoplastic volatiles is shared with other specimens of the same species within the immediate vegetative population (except in the case of random emergent chemotypes [
 <xref rid="B44-plants-09-01570" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]). As previously mentioned, phenoplasticity was observed in populations of species allied to 
 <italic>P. lasianthos</italic> [
 <xref rid="B8-plants-09-01570" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], which created distinct chemotypes. However, flamboyant expression patterns appear to characterise 
 <italic>P. rotundifolia</italic> profiles in the current study, from the Tasmanian population (ROA-2a and -2b). Hence, since phenoplasticity is active in 
 <italic>Prostanthera</italic> it makes sense to elucidate this phenomenon to create a clear picture of variation due to taxa verses variation due to plasticity.
