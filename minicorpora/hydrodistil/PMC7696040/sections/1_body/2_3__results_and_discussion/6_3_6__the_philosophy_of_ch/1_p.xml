<p>During the paradigm of chemotaxonomy, when chemical profiles were considered as an absolute taxonomic criterion, phenoplasticity would have seemed like a contradiction. During that era, many scholars were proposing mechanisms to control this variability and ensure reproducibility of chemical profiles, which involved controlling for sampling time of the day to eliminate diurnal effects, season to eliminate influences of temperature and rainfall, and storage methods to eliminate artefacts of postharvest processing. However, efforts to control the factors that created variability were defeated by expansion of study into other taxa, and over time the school of chemotaxonomy was quashed by irreproducibility in some groups, including
