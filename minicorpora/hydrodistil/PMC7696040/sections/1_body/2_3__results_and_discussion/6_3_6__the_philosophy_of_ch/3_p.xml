<p>Chemophenetic studies are often complemented by observed morphological, geographical, or molecular patterns. As a complement to other lines of evidence in defining a species [
 <xref rid="B43-plants-09-01570" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], chemical data must be identified as representing four possible scenarios: (1) INTRA-specific variability-A. Distinct chemical clusters within a single taxon that are denoted as chemotypes; (2) INTRA-specific variability-B. Nonclustering variability within a single taxon that is denoted as flamboyant inter-specimen chemical expression differences; (3) INTER-specific variability. Distinct chemical clusters across taxa that characterises species distinctness; and (4) INTER-specific convergence. Distinct chemical convergent clusters that comprise two or more taxa, which may be a consequence of conservative chemical expression in related taxa, or convergence of distantly related or unrelated taxa.
