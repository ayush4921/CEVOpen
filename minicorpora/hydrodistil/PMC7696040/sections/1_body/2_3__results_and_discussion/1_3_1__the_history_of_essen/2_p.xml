<p>Earlier studies on the chemistry of 
 <italic>Prostanthera</italic> need to be revisited with consideration to the numerous unidentified components, and the new taxonomic insights that have been realised over the last 40 or so years [

 <xref rid="B29-plants-09-01570" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The earliest chemical study published on a species of 
 <italic>Prostanthera</italic> was by R.T. Baker and H.G. Smith in 1912 [
 <xref rid="B30-plants-09-01570" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. They chemically characterised an essential oil from a new species which they named 
 <italic>P. cineolifera</italic> R.T.Baker and H.G.Sm in the same study. In their paper, they mention that essential oils from 
 <italic>Prostanthera</italic> were of interest to Joseph Bosisto (1827–1898), a chemist and politician who founded the country’s biggest Eucalyptus oil company “Bosisto’s”. Allegedly in 1862 Bosisto distilled leaves from 
 <italic>P. lasianthos</italic> and 
 <italic>P. rotundifolia</italic> but lost interest in the former due to a low yield, and the latter (0.75% yield 
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic> fresh leaves) due to a strong similarity to Eucalyptus oil.
