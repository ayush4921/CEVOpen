<p>In 1980, the late Erich V. Lassak (1934–2015) published his work on the chemical character of the essential oils from over 40 of those species in Althofer’s living collection at Burrrendong Botanic Garden and Arboretum [

 <italic>Prostanthera</italic>, as proposed by Bentham, correlated significantly to essential oil yield and chemistry. This observation was corroborated by Barry Conn when he distilled 44 specimens of 
 <italic>P. aspalathoides</italic> A.Cunn. ex Benth. ranging from South Australia into Victoria and New South Wales, as a follow up to Lassak’s work [
