<p>In the time since Lassak published his paper on 
 <italic>Prostanthera</italic> [
 <xref rid="B25-plants-09-01570" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], many of the unknown sesquiterpenes have been assigned. Nearly 30 years ago, Southwell and Tucker [
 <xref rid="B17-plants-09-01570" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] identified kessane and assigned 
 <italic>Z</italic>-dihydroagarofuran (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01570-f001">Figure 1</xref>) by spectroscopic methods from essential oil of 
 <italic>P</italic>. sp. aff. 
 <italic>ovalifolia</italic> (
 <italic>P. lanceolata</italic> Domin.), then prostantherol was assigned a year later after it was isolated from the two species 
 <italic>P.</italic> sp. aff. 
 <italic>melissifolia</italic> and 
 <italic>P. rotundifolia,</italic> growing at the Royal Botanic Gardens in Edinburgh, Scotland [
 <xref rid="B18-plants-09-01570" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Prostantherol is now known as the main component of 
 <italic>P. centralis</italic> B.J.Conn. essential oil [
