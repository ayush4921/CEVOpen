<p>A second PCA analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01570-f005">Figure 5</xref>) for species outside of the 
 <italic>P. ovalifolia</italic> complex (including the ambiguously placed 
 <italic>P. prunelloides</italic>) created four chemical groups that efficiently represent the chemical diversity of 
 <italic>Prostanthera</italic>. As can be seen in the loading plot (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01570-f005">Figure 5</xref>B) group 1 is characterised by high yields of prostantherol, group 2 by a predominantly monoterpenoid composition, including components such as α-terpinyl acetate, sabinene and α-phellandrene, group 3 by high maaliol content and group 4 by globulol, ledol and 1,8-cineole. The asterisk ‘*’ represents 
 <italic>P.</italic> sp. Blue Mountains (BEM) and 
 <italic>P. aspalathoides</italic> (ASS), which are two species that include Z-dihydroagarofuran and represent a fifth category, which correlates to group C in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01570-f004">Figure 4</xref> or Branch B in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01570-f003">Figure 3</xref>. Thus, the fifth category is the kessane and 
 <italic>Z</italic>-dihydroagarofuran yielding species that are expressed abundantly from 
 <italic>P. lanceolata</italic>. Since 
 <italic>Z</italic>-dihydroagarofuran was first described nearly a decade after the study of Conn [
 <xref rid="B27-plants-09-01570" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] it was not reported in his wide geographic study of 
 <italic>P. aspalathoides</italic> and so is reported here for the first time. One other species expressed 
 <italic>Z</italic>-dihydroagarofuran, which is a new species that we have phrase named 
 <italic>P. sp</italic>. Gibraltar Range.
