 <italic>P. incisa</italic> (branch C), respectively. In the current study, 
 <italic>P. incisa</italic> (INA-1a to -1e and -2) was the next species after 
 <italic>P. lanceolata</italic> with high sampling numbers, with six replicates. The strongly incised juvenile leaves of 
 <italic>P. lanceolata</italic> resemble those from 
 <italic>P. incisa</italic> to an extent.
