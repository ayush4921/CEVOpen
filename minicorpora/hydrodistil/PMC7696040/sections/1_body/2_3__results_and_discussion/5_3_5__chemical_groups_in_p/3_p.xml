<p>Australian botanists generally regard 
 <italic>P. incisa</italic> to be synonymous with 
 <italic>P. sieberi</italic> but it is regarded as an accepted name on the plant list [
 <xref rid="B11-plants-09-01570" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Hellyer also studied 
 <italic>P. sieberi</italic> Benth. [
 <xref rid="B33-plants-09-01570" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], which he authenticated by comparison to essential oil of 
 <italic>Eucalyptus globulus</italic>. Hellyer’s globulol-rich chemical profile of 
 <italic>P. sieberi</italic> [
 <xref rid="B33-plants-09-01570" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] markedly differs from the profile of 
 <italic>P. incisa</italic> of the current study (INA, 
 <xref rid="plants-09-01570-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01570-f005">Figure 5</xref>), which yielded a predominantly monoterpenoid essential oil comprised by 1,8-cineole, α-phellandrene, α-terpineol acetate and the sesquiterpene cadinol isomers, but no globulol. Unlike the 
 <italic>P. rotundifolia</italic> group, the chemical profile of 
 <italic>P. incisa</italic> remained relatively consistent. While the rank of 
 <italic>P. sieberi</italic> remains controversial, the current analysis questions the proposed synonymity. However, Hellyer also studied 
 <italic>P. rotundifolia</italic> from Tasmania and reported a high yield of globulol, giving a chemical profile suspiciously similar to the description he gave for 
 <italic>P. sieberi</italic>. Thus, Hellyer’s joint study of Tasmanian 
 <italic>P. rotundifolia</italic> with 
 <italic>P. sieberi</italic> and the coincidental similarity of their essential oil profiles [
 <xref rid="B33-plants-09-01570" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] beckons for a second analysis.
