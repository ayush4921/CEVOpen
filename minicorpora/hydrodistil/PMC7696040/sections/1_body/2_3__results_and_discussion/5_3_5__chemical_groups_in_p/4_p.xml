<p>All other species are outside of these clusters. Briefly, 
 <italic>P. suborbicularis</italic> C.T.White and W.D.Francis (SUS-1) and 
 <italic>P. striatiflora</italic> (STA-1) are similar, expressing high relative amounts of spathulenol, globulol and α-copaene. The two phrase named specimens of 
 <italic>P. sp.</italic> Baking Board (BGB-1 and -2) and 
 <italic>P. caerulea</italic> R.Br. (CAA-1) are predominantly monoterpenoid with &gt;83% of 1,8-cineole + β-pinene. The phrase named new species 
 <italic>P.</italic> sp. Minyon Falls (MNF-1: J.B.Williams NE61356) expressed a high amount of caryophyllene and caryophyllene oxide, potentially making it an insect repellent like 
 <italic>P. cineolifera</italic>. The phrase-named 
 <italic>P.</italic> sp. Thredbo River (TOR-1) produced an essential oil characteristic of the 
 <italic>P. lasianthos</italic> group [
 <xref rid="B8-plants-09-01570" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], which includes 1,8-cineole, linalool and linalyl acetate. A new species affiliated with 
 <italic>P. melissifolia</italic> F.Muell, known under the phrase name 
 <italic>P. sp.</italic> Dandahra Creek, produced an essential oil very similar to that of 
 <italic>Eucalyptus globulus</italic> and one of the chemical variants of 
 <italic>P. rotundifolia</italic> observed in the current study. Lastly, the three phrase-named specimens of 
 <italic>P</italic>. sp. Olney State Forest (OSF-1, -2 and -3, 
 <xref rid="plants-09-01570-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>) are potentially representative of two distinct taxa, which will require reassessment of morphology for confirmation. This is evident from the pronounced difference in essential oil yield (0.1 vs. 0.5–0.9%) and chemical character, wherein OSF-3 demonstrates 0.1% yield of essential oil with a predominantly sesquiterpeneoid character. In this last example, the signs of phenoplasticity of volatiles are not hitherto evident, which conveys that this difference may not be an environmentally affected chemotype.
