<p>The Royal Botanic Gardens Kew (London) describes the genus 
 <italic>Prostanthera</italic> as having high horticultural value. Hence, in modern times, Australian home gardens are seeing a steady increase in species of 
 <italic>Prostanthera</italic> under the common name ‘Australian mint bush’, which is partly due to the efforts of Althofer and modern indigenous plant nurseries. Species that are available commercially are often marketed as ‘culinary herbs for seasoning and flavouring’ [

 <italic>P. rotundifolia</italic> R.Br., and 
 <italic>P. incisa</italic> R.Br., which add a eucalyptus flavour to jellies and chutneys. Some species are also known for medicinal effects in the treatment of topical afflictions, such as 
 <italic>P. rotundifolia</italic>, which is made into ointments for sores and infections [
 <xref rid="B3-plants-09-01570" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], or 
 <italic>P. striatiflora</italic> F.Muell., which is used in fumigation modalities for lung afflictions [
