0: Fortunately, the widespread inclusion of species of  Prostanthera in the marketplace has aided in the conservation of rare and endangered genotypes, but it has also exacerbated the miscarriage of species identification.
1: This confusion is echoed in the numbers of mis-determinations made on vouchers lodged at herbariums or in field surveys.
2: Another layer of complexity is from the phenotypic plasticity of chemistry and morphology in relation to soil and climate.
3: Thus, due to the waxing importance of the mint bushes in horticulture and the challenges faced in taxonomy at large, a chemophenetic study is timely.
4: The current study is focused on high essential oil yielding taxa, with other low yielding specimens included for comparison purposes.
5: The main objective is to explore the phenetic relationships among taxa of  Prostanthera using only the chemistry and yield of volatiles, giving comparison to morphology and taxa where appropriate, and to highlight the true diversity within the genus.
