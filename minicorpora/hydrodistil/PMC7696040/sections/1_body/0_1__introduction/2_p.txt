0: The Royal Botanic Gardens Kew (London) describes the genus  Prostanthera as having high horticultural value.
1: Hence, in modern times, Australian home gardens are seeing a steady increase in species of  Prostanthera under the common name Australian mint bush, which is partly due to the efforts of Althofer and modern indigenous plant nurseries.
2: Species that are available commercially are often marketed as culinary herbs for seasoning and flavouring [ 2].
3: This includes  P. rotundifolia R.Br., and  P. incisa R.Br., which add a eucalyptus flavour to jellies and chutneys.
4: Some species are also known for medicinal effects in the treatment of topical afflictions, such as  P. rotundifolia, which is made into ointments for sores and infections [ 3], or  P. striatiflora F.Muell., which is used in fumigation modalities for lung afflictions [ 4, 5, 6].
