<p>In 1978, the late Australian botanist, George William Francis Althofer (1903–1993), released his book ‘
 <italic>Cradle of Incense: The story of Australian Prostanthera</italic>’ [
 <xref rid="B1-plants-09-01570" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Althofer procured a vast collection of species of 
 <italic>Prostanthera</italic> Labill. for cultivation at Burrrendong Botanic Garden and Arboretum, which he founded outside of Wellington (NSW, Australia) in 1964. Through his collection, Althofer became aware of the true diversity within the genus and recognised new species, but some were never published, such as 
 <italic>Prostanthera</italic> species Ulan (
 <italic>P.</italic> sp. Ulan; currently circumscribed as 
 <italic>P. rotundifolia</italic> R.Br.).
