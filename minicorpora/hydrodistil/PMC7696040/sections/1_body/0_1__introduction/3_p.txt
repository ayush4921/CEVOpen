0: The essential oils from species in  Prostanthera are generally rich in 1,8-cineole and key sesquiterpenes ( Figure 1).
1: However, taxa in the  P. lasianthos Labill.
2: heterogeneous species aggregate are atypical and were published earlier [ 7, 8, 9, 10].
3: Over the course of multiple studies, it was realised that the two most prominent factors affecting the yield and chemical character of volatiles from  P. lasianthos and closely allied species are (1) taxa and (2) soil or microclimate.
4: It was hypothesised that drained soils influenced lower yields of volatiles that produced less 1,8-cineole and display a higher relative abundance of the other components, such as linalyl acetate, caryophyllene or -selinene.
5: However, even after acknowledging this phenotypic plasticity, a taxonomic agreement could also be demonstrated, giving intra-specific and inter-specific chemotypes [ 8].
