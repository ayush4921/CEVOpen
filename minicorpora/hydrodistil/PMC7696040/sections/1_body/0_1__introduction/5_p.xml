<p>There are currently 137 species of 
 <italic>Prostanthera</italic> recognised on The Plant List [
 <xref rid="B11-plants-09-01570" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]; however, the actual number of species is much higher, since there are many that are hitherto unrecognised. As demonstrated in previous studies, there are at least seven new taxa in the 
 <italic>P. lasianthos</italic> heterogeneous aggregate [
 <xref rid="B8-plants-09-01570" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and more that are incorrectly circumscribed or affiliated with another taxon. For example, the Australasian Virtual Herbarium catalogues multiple 
 <italic>Prostanthera</italic> with only phrase names [
 <xref rid="B12-plants-09-01570" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Most of the taxa included in the current study are commonly identified incorrectly as 
 <italic>P. ovalifolia</italic> R.Br. or 
 <italic>P. rotundifolia</italic> and their correct names have remained unused and forgotten. Other taxa have been given only tentative names by affiliation but require a published morphological characterisation and incorporation into the taxonomic key.
