0: There are currently 137 species of  Prostanthera recognised on The Plant List [ 11]; however, the actual number of species is much higher, since there are many that are hitherto unrecognised.
1: As demonstrated in previous studies, there are at least seven new taxa in the  P. lasianthos heterogeneous aggregate [ 8] and more that are incorrectly circumscribed or affiliated with another taxon.
2: For example, the Australasian Virtual Herbarium catalogues multiple  Prostanthera with only phrase names [ 12].
3: Most of the taxa included in the current study are commonly identified incorrectly as  P. ovalifolia R.Br.
4: or  P. rotundifolia and their correct names have remained unused and forgotten.
5: Other taxa have been given only tentative names by affiliation but require a published morphological characterisation and incorporation into the taxonomic key.
