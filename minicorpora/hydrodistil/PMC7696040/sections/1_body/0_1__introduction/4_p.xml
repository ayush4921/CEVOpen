<p>In the 
 <italic>P. lasianthos</italic> heterogeneous aggregate, chemical variability within a single taxon conformed to a continuum between two extreme chemical profiles, i.e., from 0 to &gt;80% of 1,8-cineole, corroborating phenotypic plasticity. While this was evident from the study of 
 <italic>P.</italic> sp. Wollomombi Gorge (J.B.Williams NE73839) [
 <xref rid="B8-plants-09-01570" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], preliminary data on other taxa conveyed a general trend toward a similar conclusion. Hence, the chemical profile of volatile organic compounds can be diagnostic of single taxa, provided that the identities and patterns of phenoplastic volatile organic compounds within single taxa are understood. Examples of phenoplastic compounds are 1,8-cineole (
 <italic>P. sp.</italic> Wollomombi Gorge), Î±-pinene (
 <italic>P. eungella</italic> B.J.Conn and K.M.Proft), linalyl acetate (
 <italic>P. sp.</italic> Wollomombi Gorge), just to name a few [
