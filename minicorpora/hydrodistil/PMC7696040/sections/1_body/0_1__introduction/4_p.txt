0: In the  P. lasianthos heterogeneous aggregate, chemical variability within a single taxon conformed to a continuum between two extreme chemical profiles, i.e., from 0 to >80% of 1,8-cineole, corroborating phenotypic plasticity.
1: While this was evident from the study of  P. sp.
2: Wollomombi Gorge (J.B.Williams NE73839) [ 8], preliminary data on other taxa conveyed a general trend toward a similar conclusion.
3: Hence, the chemical profile of volatile organic compounds can be diagnostic of single taxa, provided that the identities and patterns of phenoplastic volatile organic compounds within single taxa are understood.
4: Examples of phenoplastic compounds are 1,8-cineole ( P. sp.
5: Wollomombi Gorge), -pinene ( P. eungella B.J.Conn and K.M.Proft), linalyl acetate ( P. sp.
6: Wollomombi Gorge), just to name a few [ 8].
