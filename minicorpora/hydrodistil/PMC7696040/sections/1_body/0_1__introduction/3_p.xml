<p>The essential oils from species in 
 <italic>Prostanthera</italic> are generally rich in 1,8-cineole and key sesquiterpenes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01570-f001">Figure 1</xref>). However, taxa in the 
 <italic>P. lasianthos</italic> Labill. heterogeneous species aggregate are atypical and were published earlier [
 <xref rid="B7-plants-09-01570" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-plants-09-01570" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-plants-09-01570" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-plants-09-01570" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Over the course of multiple studies, it was realised that the two most prominent factors affecting the yield and chemical character of volatiles from 
 <italic>P. lasianthos</italic> and closely allied species are (1) taxa and (2) soil or microclimate. It was hypothesised that drained soils influenced lower yields of volatiles that produced less 1,8-cineole and display a higher relative abundance of the other components, such as linalyl acetate, caryophyllene or Î²-selinene. However, even after acknowledging this phenotypic plasticity, a taxonomic agreement could also be demonstrated, giving intra-specific and inter-specific chemotypes [
