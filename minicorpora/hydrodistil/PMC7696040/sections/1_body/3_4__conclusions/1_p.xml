<p>While chemophenetics can reveal previously unknown relationships within heterogeneous species aggregates or reiterate observations made in current or earlier times, the flamboyant expression of phenoplastic compounds in some species means that patterns are not easily perceptible to scientists from other disciplines, or the general community. Nevertheless, to a phytochemist, the patterns are clear. The data show that some species are related by the presence of sesquiterpene ethers, 
 <italic>Z</italic>-dihydroagarofuran and kessane. Some are related by decahydroazulenic compounds, such as globulol, ledol or epiglobulol. Some are related by decahydronapthalenic compounds, such as prostantherol or maaliol.
