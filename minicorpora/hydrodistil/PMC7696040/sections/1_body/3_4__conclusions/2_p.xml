<p>The currently assigned heterogeneous species aggregates 
 <italic>P.</italic> sp. aff. 
 <italic>ovalifolia</italic> and 
 <italic>P.</italic> sp. aff. 
 <italic>rotundifolia</italic> are not segregated according to their phytochemistry. Rather, individual taxa are demonstrated to generally stand-alone according to individual essential oil chemical profiles. For example, 
 <italic>Z</italic>-dihydroagarofuran is expressed in 
 <italic>P. lanceolata</italic> (LAA: affiliated with 
 <italic>P. ovalifolia</italic>) and in 
 <italic>P.</italic> sp. Blue Mountains (BEM: affiliated with 
 <italic>P. rotundifolia</italic>). However, both are segregated by multivariate analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01570-f003">Figure 3</xref>), except for the one specimen LAA-1 that expressed a low amount of p-cymene (
 <xref rid="plants-09-01570-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Nevertheless, by far the prevailing chemical phenotypes do not overlap.
