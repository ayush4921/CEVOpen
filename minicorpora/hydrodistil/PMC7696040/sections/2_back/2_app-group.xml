Species, reference and code corresponding to essential oil chemical profiles taken from published data. To see the chemical profiles of these species see cited literature [supplementary: 1,2]. Figure S1: 
   <sup>13</sup>C NMR of kessane isolated from the variagated ‘Prostanthera ovalifolia’ from a cultivated specimen. Processing software is Spinworks™. Figure S2: 
   <sup>13</sup>C NMR of pure prostantherol isolated from Prostanthera petraea. Processing software is Spinworks™. Figure S3: 
   <sup>13</sup>C NMR of near pure maaliol in whole essential oil from Prostanthera lithospermoides. Processing software is Spinworks™. Figure S4: 
   <sup>13</sup>C NMR of globulol in enriched fraction of the essential oil from Prostanthera aspalathoides (collection from condenser by hexane gave globulol and Z-dihydroagarofuran). Processing software is Spinworks™. Figure S5: 
   <sup>13</sup>C NMR of epiglobulol as a major component of the whole essential oil of Tasmanian Prostanthera rotundifolia. The selected shifts (ppm) are from the epiglobulol. Processing software is Spinworks™. Figure S6: 
   <sup>13</sup>C NMR of ledol in whole essential oil from Tasmanian Prostanthera rotundifolia. The selected shifts (ppm) are for the ledol. Processing software is Spinworks™. Figure S7: 
   <sup>13</sup>C of Z-dihydroagarofuran in enriched fraction of essential oil from Prostanthera aspalathoides (collection from the condenser by hexane gave this enriched fraction). Processing software is Spinworks™. Figure S8: 
   <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra of globulol isolated from Prostanthera sp. Piliga. Processing software is Spinworks™.
