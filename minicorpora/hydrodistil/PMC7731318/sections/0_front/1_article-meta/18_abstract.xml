 <p>This study aimed to investigate the chemical composition of the leaf essential oil from Ivoirian 
  <italic>Isolona dewevrei</italic>. A combination of chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques (GC(RI), GC-MS and 
  <sup>13</sup>C-NMR) was used to analyze two oil samples (S1 and S2). Detailed analysis by repetitive column chromatography (CC) of essential oil sample S2 was performed, leading to the isolation of four compounds. Their structures were elucidated by QTOF-MS, 1D and 2D-NMR as (10βH)-1β,8β-oxido-cadin-4-ene (
  <bold>38</bold>), 4-methylene-(7αH)-germacra-1(10),5-dien-8β-ol (
  <italic>cis</italic>-germacrene D-8-ol) (
  <bold>52</bold>), 4-methylene-(7αH)-germacra-1(10),5-dien-8α-ol (
  <italic>trans</italic>-germacrene D-8-ol) (
  <bold>53</bold>) and cadina-1(10),4-dien-8β-ol (
  <bold>56</bold>). Compounds 
  <bold>38</bold>, 
  <bold>52</bold> and 
  <bold>53</bold> are new, whereas NMR data of 
  <bold>56</bold> are reported for the first time. Lastly, 57 constituents accounting for 95.5% (S1) and 97.1% (S2) of the whole compositions were identified. Samples S1 and S2 were dominated by germacrene D (23.6 and 20.5%, respectively), followed by germacrene D-8-one (8.9 and 8.7%), (10βH)-1β,8β-oxido-cadin-4-ene (7.3 and 8.7), 4-methylene-(7αH)-germacra-1(10),5-dien-8β-ol (7.8 and 7.4%) and cadina-1(10),4-dien-8β-ol (7.6 and 7.2%). Leaves from 
  <italic>I. dewevrei</italic> produced sesquiterpene-rich essential oil with an original chemical composition, involving various compounds reported for the first time among the main components. Integrated analysis by GC(RI), GC-MS and 
  <sup>13</sup>C-NMR appeared fruitful for the knowledge of such a complex essential oil.
