<p>Although various constituents were identified by the mean of the three techniques, several others, some of which were present at appreciable amounts, remained unidentified. Special attention was paid to four of them that belong to the oxygenated sesquiterpene family, according to their apolar and polar retention indices: compounds 
 <bold>38</bold> (retention indices measured on apolar and polar capillary column, respectively (RIa/RIp) = 1534/1853; 7.3 and 8.7%), 
 <bold>52</bold> and 
 <bold>53</bold> (RIa/RIp = 1657/2355; 10.4 and 9.9%) and 
 <bold>56</bold> (RIa/RIp = 1676/2276; 7.6 and 7.2%). Therefore, essential oil sample S2, which had a higher amount (2.9 g) and contained the four unidentified compounds, was subjected to repetitive column chromatography (CC) in order to perform structural elucidation. In parallel, analysis of CC fractions by GC(RI), GC-MS and 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR led to the identification of several minor components.
