<p>The chemical composition of two essential oil samples (S1, S2) from wild 
 <italic>I. dewevrei</italic> was determined by a combination of repetitive column chromatography (CC), GC(RI), GC-MS and 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR. In total, fifty-seven components accounting for 95.5 and 97.1% of the composition of the whole oil sample were identified. Compounds 
 <bold>38</bold>, 
 <bold>52</bold> and 
 <bold>53</bold> are reported for the first time, whereas NMR data of 
 <bold>56</bold> are described for the first time. The composition of the two leaf oil samples (S1 and S2) was largely dominated by oxygenated sesquiterpenes (44.1 and 44.9%, respectively) and hydrocarbon sesquiterpenes (41.2 and 40.2%, respectively), the sesquiterpene fraction accounting for 85.3 and 85.1%, respectively (
