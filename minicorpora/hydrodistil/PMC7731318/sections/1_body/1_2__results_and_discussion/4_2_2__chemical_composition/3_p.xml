<p>Investigations carried out on 
 <italic>I. dewevrei</italic> leaf essential oil, using a combination of chromatographic (CC, GC(RI)) and spectroscopic techniques (GC-MS, 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR), led to the identification of fifty-seven constituents accounting for 95.51 and 97.1% of the whole oil samples’ compositions. The two samples were characterized by a similar chemical composition dominated by germacrene D (23.6 and 20.5%, respectively), followed by germacrene 
 <sc>d</sc>-8-one (8.9 and 8.7%), (10βH)-1β,8β-epoxy-cadina-4-ene (
 <bold>38</bold>) (7.3 and 8.7%), (7αH)-germacrene 
 <sc>d</sc>-8β-ol (
 <bold>52</bold>) (7.8 and 7.4%) and cadina-1(10),4-dien-8β-ol (
 <bold>56</bold>) (7.6 and 7.2%). Compounds 
 <bold>38</bold>, 
 <bold>52</bold> as well as (7αH)-germacrene D-8α-ol 
 <bold>53</bold> are new natural sesquiterpenes, isolated from sample S2 and fully characterized by QTOF-MS, 1D and 2D-NMR. In addition, cadina-1(10),4-dien-8β-ol (
 <bold>56</bold>) was also isolated from this oil sample and its NMR data are reported for the first time.
