<p>Leaves from 
 <italic>I. dewevrei</italic> produced a sesquiterpene-rich essential oil with an original chemical composition, displaying various compounds that are reported for the first time. The previously reported chemical composition of leaf oil from this species was dominated by germacrene B, (5αH,10βMe)-6,12-oxido-elema-1,3,6,11(12)-tetraene, germacrene D, (
 <italic>Z</italic>)-β-ocimene, γ-elemene and (
 <italic>E</italic>)-β-caryophyllene [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-25-05613" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Thus, qualitative and quantitative differences appeared between the compositions of the previous and the present study. Hence, the chemical variability of the leaf essential oil of 
 <italic>I. dewevrei</italic> should be evaluated by investigating a larger number of oil samples.
