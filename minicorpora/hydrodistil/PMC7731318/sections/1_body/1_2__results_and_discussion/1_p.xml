<p>Two leaf essential oil samples (S1 and S2) from 
 <italic>I. dewevrei</italic> growing wild in Côte d’Ivoire were obtained by hydrodistillation of fresh leaves and the yields calculated on a weight basis (
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic>) were 0.105 and 0.121%, respectively. The oil samples were first analyzed by a combination of GC(RI), GC-MS and 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR, following a computerized method developed at the University of Corsica. This method allowed identification of components present at a content as low as 0.4–0.5% and compiled in our laboratory-made
