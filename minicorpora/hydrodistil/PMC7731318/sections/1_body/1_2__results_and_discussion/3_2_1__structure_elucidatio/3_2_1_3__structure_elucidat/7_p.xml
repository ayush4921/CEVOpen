<p>-In the first one, a compound has been identified in the aerial parts of 
 <italic>Ferula flabelliloba</italic> on the basis of its mass spectrum as being cadina-1(10),4-dien-8β-ol [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-25-05613" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, the structure represented by the authors, drawing a 
 <italic>cis</italic> stereochemistry of H6 (hydrogen of the ring junction) and the isopropyl group and a 
 <italic>trans</italic> stereochemistry of the isopropyl and hydroxyl groups, was rather that of the 8α isomer (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05613-f003">Figure 3</xref>). Moreover, it could be pointed out that the measured retention index (RI) (CP Sil 5 CB) = 1678 [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-25-05613" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] fitted with RI (CP Sil 5 CB) = 1680 measured for the 8α isomer [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-25-05613" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and RI (DB1) measured for the 8β isomer (1676; this work).
