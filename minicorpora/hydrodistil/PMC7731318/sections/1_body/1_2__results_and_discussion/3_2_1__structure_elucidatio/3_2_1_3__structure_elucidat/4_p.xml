<p>The relative stereochemistry of substituents of compound 
 <bold>56</bold> was established through NOESY spatial correlations. Protons H6, H11, H12 and H13 correlated together indicating a 
 <italic>cis</italic> stereochemistry of H6 and the isopropyl group. Similarly, H7 correlated with H8 leading to the 
 <italic>cis</italic> stereochemistry of the isopropyl group and the hydroxyl function. Coupling constants of H6 (11.0 Hz) and H7 (11.0 and 4.3 Hz) are in agreement with NOESY correlations. Therefore, compound 
 <bold>56</bold> is cadina-1(10),4-dien-8Î²-ol (
