<p>The measured exact mass was 220.1823 g/mol, corresponding to C
 <sub>15</sub>H
 <sub>24</sub>O formula (calculated mass = 220.1822 g/mol). The 
 <sup>1</sup>H-NMR, 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR and DEPT spectra were in agreement with this formula, which involved four unsaturation degrees. These spectra also confirmed the presence of an alcohol function (C8, 65.54 ppm) (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-05613">Supplementary Materials, Figures S18â€“S26</xref>). Four sp
 <sup>2</sup> carbon signals including three quaternary carbons, involved in two C=C double bonds, were observed. Taking into account the four unsaturation degrees, compound 
 <bold>57</bold> obviously bears a bicyclic structure. The 
 <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectrum evidenced an isopropyl group: H11 (1.45 ppm, dsept: 9.3, 6.7 Hz), H12 (0.94 ppm, d: 6.7 Hz) and H13 (0.87 ppm, d: 6.7 Hz); confirmed by the COSY spectrum and two methyl groups linked to sp
 <sup>2</sup> quaternary carbons (H14, 1.67 ppm, broad s; H15, 1.69 ppm, broad s). COSY correlations also evidenced two other hydrogen groups formed by the sequences H2-H3 and H5-H6-H7-H8-H9 and they indicated that the isopropyl group was linked to C7.
