<p>This compound is an epimer of cadina-1(10),4-dien-8α-ol isolated by Weyerstahl et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-25-05613" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] from the essential oil of Iranian 
 <italic>Pulicaria gnaphalodes</italic> (Vent.) Boiss. Differences in chemical shifts of both isomers agree with the axial/equatorial stereochemistry of the hydroxyl group, particularly the shielding of C6 due to the γ steric effect of the hydroxyl group.
