<p>Sub-fraction F5.3.1 (19 mg) contained compound 
 <bold>56</bold> (98.3%), with RIs apol/pol = 1676/2276, suggesting an oxygenated sesquiterpene. The electron ionization (EI)-mass spectrum of compound

 <italic>z</italic> = 202), characteristic of a sesquiterpene alcohol. However, no structure proposal emerged from GC-MS analysis with an acceptable fit (commercial MS libraries and home-made MS library). Therefore, structural elucidation was undertaken.
