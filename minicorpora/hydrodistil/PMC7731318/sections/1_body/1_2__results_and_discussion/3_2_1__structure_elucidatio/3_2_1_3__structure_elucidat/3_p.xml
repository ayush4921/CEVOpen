<p>Correlation plots in the HMBC spectrum allowed the construction of the bicyclic skeleton. For instance, proton H8 geminated to the hydroxyl function correlates with C6, C7, C9 and the ethylenic quaternary carbon C10. Proton H6, located at the ring junction, correlates with C1, C2 and C10 on the one hand and with C4, C5 and C7 on the other hand. Otherwise, protons H14 and H15 correlated with sp
 <sup>2</sup> quaternary carbons C10 and C4. Thus, the C14 and C15 methyl groups were linked to C10 and C4, respectively. It is possible to determine the structure of compound 
 <bold>56</bold> as cadina-1(10),4-dien-8-ol.
