<p>Starting from the methine linked to the oxygen atom (CH, 81.75 ppm, 4.27 ppm, d, 5.2 Hz) the HMBC correlations evidenced the oxa-bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane (oxa norbornane) substructure bearing the isopropyl group on C7 and the methyl group on C10. Correlation plots observed on the COSY spectrum between H7 and H11 on the one hand and between H10 and H14 on the other hand confirmed the position of both substituents on the oxa-norbornane framework. The last four carbons, including two sp
 <sup>2</sup> carbons and two sp
 <sup>3</sup> carbons, constituted the third cycle, obviously cyclohexenic. HMBC correlation plots allowed the positioning of the cyclohexene sub-structure vs. the oxa-norbornane moiety as well as the position of the methyl group on the double bond.
