<p>Therefore, the molecule under investigation possesses a bicyclo[4.4.0]decane skeleton with an oxide function between C1 and C8, drawing an oxa-norbornane sub-structure that bears a methyl on C10 and an isopropyl group on C7. The second cycle is a cyclohexene with a vinylic methyl on C4. Therefore, this molecule may be considered as a 1,8-oxido-cadin-4-ene. </p>
