 <sup>1</sup>H, 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR and DEPT spectra indicated the occurrence of a tri-substituted double bond (C4, 133.78 ppm and C5, 122.89 ppm) and two carbons bearing the oxygen atom (C, 86.26 ppm and CH, 81.09 ppm), belonging to an oxide sub-structure. Taking into account the four unsaturation degrees and this double bond, compound 
 <bold>38</bold> bears a tricyclic structure.
