<p>Eight stereoisomers may be drawn, four of these display a 
 <italic>cis</italic> stereochemistry of the bicyclo[4.4.0]decane ring junction, the last four display a 
 <italic>trans</italic> stereochemistry of the ring junction. The relative configurations of the ring junction and those of carbons bearing the methyl and isopropyl groups were determined through NOESY correlations. Indeed, the observed correlation between H7 and H14 located the isopropyl group in the exo position vs. the oxa-norbornane sub-structure as well as the methyl 14 in the endo position. In parallel, the NOESY correlation between H6, H11 and H13 corroborated a 
 <italic>cis</italic> junction of the bicyclo[4.4.0]decane framework.
