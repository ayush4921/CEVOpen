<p>Similarly, all correlations observed on HMBC and COSY spectra for the minor component 
 <bold>53</bold> led to the same structure of germacrene D-8-ol. The E stereochemistry of the intracyclic double bonds is evidenced similarly to 
 <bold>52</bold>. Thus, compounds 
 <bold>52</bold> and 
 <bold>53</bold> are epimers. Unfortunately, signals of H7 and H8 appeared as multiplets and therefore they were not useful for stereochemical investigation. Moreover, the NOESY spectrum was not very informative. However, two points may be highlighted; (i) the occurrence of a correlation plot between H8 and H11 (absent in the spectrum of 
 <bold>52</bold>) and (ii) the lack of correlation plot between H7 and H8, which are located in a 
 <italic>trans</italic> antiperiplanar conformation, this plot being observed in the spectrum of 
 <bold>52</bold>. Lastly, considering that the cyclodecadiene moiety adopts a chair-boat-chair conformation, the deshielding (3.5 ppm) of C8 in 
 <bold>53</bold> vs. 
 <bold>52</bold> is in agreement with the axial/equatorial stereochemistry of the hydroxyl group (compared with menthol/neo-menthol, for instance). Compound 
 <bold>53</bold> is named 4-methylene-(7αH)-germacra-1(10),5-dien-8α-ol or (7αH)-germacrene d-8α-ol or 
 <italic>trans</italic>-germacrene 
 <sc>d</sc>-8-ol.
