<p>Sub-fraction F5.3.3 (26 mg) exhibited a single chromatographic peak—(99.4% on GC apolar and polar columns). In contrast, the 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectrum of this sub-fraction displayed two series of 15 carbon signals easily distinguishable by their relative intensities (compounds 
 <bold>52</bold> + 
 <bold>53</bold>). The ratio calculated by the mean of protonated carbons’ relative intensities was 7/3 (compounds 
 <bold>52</bold>/
 <bold>53</bold>).
