<p>The (E) stereochemistry of the intracyclic double bonds was evidenced by the value of the coupling constant (16.1 Hz) for C5=C6 and by the occurrence of a correlation plot between H1 and H9 in the NOESY spectrum for C1=C10. The relative stereochemistry of the isopropyl and hydroxyl groups was determined through (i) the values of coupling constants of signals of geminated hydrogens; (ii) NOE spatial correlations observed between various protons. Indeed, H6 appears as a dd (J
 <sub>H5-H6</sub> = 16.1 Hz, and J
 <sub>H6-H7</sub> = 9.8 Hz). In turn, the signal of H7 is a dt (J
 <sub>H6-H7</sub> = 9.8 Hz, J
 <sub>H7-H11</sub> = 2.5 Hz and J
 <sub>H7-H8</sub> = 2.5 Hz). Assuming that the isopropyl group adopts an equatorial position, H7 is axial and the coupling constant value J
 <sub>H7-H8</sub> = 2.5Hz locates H8 in equatorial position. Therefore, H7 and H8 display a 
 <italic>cis</italic> stereochemistry as well as the isopropyl and hydroxyl groups and 
 <bold>52</bold> is 
 <italic>cis</italic>-germacrene D-8-ol. This point is corroborated by the observation in the NOESY spectrum of a correlation plot between H7 and H8, confirming that both protons are in the same side of the molecule. The structure of 
 <bold>52</bold> is elucidated as 4-methylene-(7αH)-germacra-1(10)
 <italic>E</italic>,5
 <italic>E</italic>-dien-8β-ol or germacrene-
 <sc>d</sc>-8β-ol or 
 <italic>cis</italic>-germacrene-
 <sc>d</sc>-8-ol (
