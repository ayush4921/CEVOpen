<p>Compounds 
 <bold>52</bold> and 
 <bold>53,</bold> which co-eluted on apolar and polar columns, look uneasily separable by chromatographic techniques at our disposal. Therefore, the NMR extraction technique was used on the sub-fraction that contained only the two compounds (99.4%, ratio 7/3) for their structural elucidation [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-25-05613" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-25-05613" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This technique consisted of first assigning the 
 <sup>1</sup>H and 
 <sup>13</sup>C chemical shifts of each compound, taking into account the relative intensities of their signals and using the HSQC spectrum. Then, the specific correlations of each isomer were plotted on the other 2D-NMR spectra, i.e., COSY, NOESY, HMBC. Lastly, the determination of their respective structure was achieved by using the specific correlations belonging to each compound.
