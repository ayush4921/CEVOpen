<p>The scanning of the chromatographic peak afforded super imposable mass spectra and the exact mass measured was 220.1823 g/mol, corresponding to C
 <sub>15</sub>H
 <sub>24</sub>O formula (calculated mass = 220.1822 g/mol). In addition, the two series of 
 <sup>13</sup>C chemical shifts corresponding to these compounds were very similar. Indeed, each compound displayed six sp
 <sup>2</sup> carbon signals, which consisted of two quaternary carbons, three methines and an ethylenic methylene (109.34 and 112.25 ppm, respectively; 
 <bold>52</bold> and 
 <bold>53</bold>). The nine other signals belonged to sp
 <sup>3</sup> carbons and each structure of compound was constituted of three methines, of which one carbon linked to an oxygen atom (69.57 and 73.13 ppm, respectively; 
 <bold>52</bold> and 
 <bold>53</bold>), three methylenes and three methyl groups (

 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR and DEPT spectra corroborated the C
 <sub>15</sub>H
 <sub>24</sub>O formula, which involved four unsaturation degrees. Each compound exhibited six sp
 <sup>2</sup> carbons that belonged to three double bonds, which were obviously monocyclic; therefore, they may be considered more precisely as methylene cyclodecadienols and the various observations suggested the presence of two epimers.
