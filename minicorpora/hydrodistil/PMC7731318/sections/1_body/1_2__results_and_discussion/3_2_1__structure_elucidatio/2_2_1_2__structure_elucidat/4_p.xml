<p>Concerning the major compound 
 <bold>52</bold>, NMR spectra evidenced an isopropyl group: H11 (1.69 ppm, m), H12 (0.97 ppm, d: 6.7 Hz) and H13 (0.87 ppm, d: 6.7 Hz); as well as a methyl group linked to a sp
 <sup>2</sup> quaternary carbon (H14, 1.71 ppm, broad s) and an exocyclic methylene (H15, 4.78 and 4.82, br d: 2.3Hz). Therefore, the molecule contained the cyclodecadiene structure, substituted by a hydroxyl group. In addition, two deshielded methine signals (C8, 69.57 and C7, 57.56 ppm) suggested a first carbon linked to the hydroxyl group and a carbon in Î± of the previous carbon, probably deshielded by the isopropyl group. This was confirmed by correlations observed on the HMBC spectrum, which evidenced that the isopropyl group was linked to C7. Multiplicity of vinylic proton signals (H5: 5.79 ppm, d, 16.1 Hz; H6: 5.56 ppm, dd, 16.1, 9.8 Hz) demonstrated a CH=CH double bond. According to the correlations observed on the HMBC spectrum, this double bond was located between C7 and the quaternary carbon (C4, 148.76 ppm) of the exocyclic C=CH
 <sub>2</sub>. This was confirmed by correlation plots observed on the COSY, which also showed two proton groups formed by the sequences H1-H2-H3 and H5-H6-H7-H8-H9. The HMBC correlations of the hydrogens H1, H3 and H9 completed the structure of compound 
 <bold>52</bold> as 4-methylene-germacra-1(10),5-dien-8-ol.
