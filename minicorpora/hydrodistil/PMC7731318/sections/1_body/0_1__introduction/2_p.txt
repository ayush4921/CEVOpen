0: Reported studies carried out on solvent extracts of  I. campanulata and  I. cooperi have led to the isolation and identification of various alkaloids, sterols and sesquiterpenes [ 3, 4, 5].
1: Concerning the volatile constituents of  Isolona species, the chemical compositions of essential oils from  I. cooperi and  I. campanulata were determined.
2: The main constituents of leaf and stem bark oils from  I. cooperi were ( Z)--ocimene and -terpinene, while the composition of root bark oil was dominated by 5-isopentenylindole and ( E)--caryophyllene [ 6].
3: The leaf oil from  I. campanulata was rich in sesquiterpenes and its composition was dominated either by eudesm-5-en-11-ol or by ( E)--caryophyllene and -humulene [ 7].
4: In previous works, we investigated and reported for the first time the chemical compositions of leaf, root and stem bark essential oils from  I. dewevrei, dominated by germacrene B/germacrene D and by cyperene, respectively.
5: From the leaf oil, four new compounds were isolated and characterized as 6,12-oxido-germacra-1(10),4,6,11(12)-tetraene, (5H,10Me)-6,12-oxido-elema-1,3,6,11(12)-tetraene, germacra-1(10),4,7(11)-trien-6,12--lactone and (1H,5H)-6,12-oxido-guaia-6,10(14),11(12)-trien-4-ol [ 8].
6: The structure of germacrene D-8-one, another new natural compound, was also elucidated after isolation from the stem bark essential oil of the plant [ 9].
