<p>Reported studies carried out on solvent extracts of 
 <italic>I. campanulata</italic> and 
 <italic>I. cooperi</italic> have led to the isolation and identification of various alkaloids, sterols and sesquiterpenes [

 <xref rid="B4-molecules-25-05613" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-25-05613" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Concerning the volatile constituents of 
 <italic>Isolona</italic> species, the chemical compositions of essential oils from 
 <italic>I. cooperi</italic> and 
 <italic>I. campanulata</italic> were determined. The main constituents of leaf and stem bark oils from 
 <italic>I. cooperi</italic> were (
 <italic>Z</italic>)-β-ocimene and γ-terpinene, while the composition of root bark oil was dominated by 5-isopentenylindole and (
 <italic>E</italic>)-β-caryophyllene [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-25-05613" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The leaf oil from 
 <italic>I. campanulata</italic> was rich in sesquiterpenes and its composition was dominated either by eudesm-5-en-11-ol or by (
 <italic>E</italic>)-β-caryophyllene and α-humulene [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-25-05613" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In previous works, we investigated and reported for the first time the chemical compositions of leaf, root and stem bark essential oils from 
 <italic>I. dewevrei</italic>, dominated by germacrene B/germacrene D and by cyperene, respectively. From the leaf oil, four new compounds were isolated and characterized as 6,12-oxido-germacra-1(10),4,6,11(12)-tetraene, (5αH,10βMe)-6,12-oxido-elema-1,3,6,11(12)-tetraene, germacra-1(10),4,7(11)-trien-6,12-γ-lactone and (1βH,5βH)-6,12-oxido-guaia-6,10(14),11(12)-trien-4α-ol [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-25-05613" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The structure of germacrene D-8-one, another new natural compound, was also elucidated after isolation from the stem bark essential oil of the plant [
