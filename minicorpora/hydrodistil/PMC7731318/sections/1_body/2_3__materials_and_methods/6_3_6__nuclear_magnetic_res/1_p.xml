<p>All nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE 400 Fourier transform spectrometer (Bruker, Wissembourg, France) operating at 400.132 MHz for 
 <sup>1</sup>H and 100.623 MHz for 
 <sup>13</sup>C, equipped with a 5 mm probe, in CDCl
 <sub>3</sub>, with all shifts referred to internal TMS. The 
 <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectra were recorded with the following parameters: pulse width (PW), 4.3 μs; relaxation delay 1 s and acquisition time 2.6 s for 32 K data table with a spectral width (SW) of 6000 Hz. 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectra of the oil samples and fractions of CC were recorded with the following parameters: pulse width = 4 µs (flip angle 45°); acquisition time = 2.7 s for 128 K data table with a spectral width of 25,000 Hz (250 ppm); CPD mode decoupling; digital resolution = 0.183 Hz/pt. Standard pulse sequences from Bruker Topspin
 <sup>TM</sup> (Bruker, Wissembourg, France) library were used for two-dimensional spectra. Gradient-enhanced sequences were used for the heteronuclear two-dimensional experiments. Spectra were processed via Mestrelab MestreNOVA software (version 12.0.0-20080).
