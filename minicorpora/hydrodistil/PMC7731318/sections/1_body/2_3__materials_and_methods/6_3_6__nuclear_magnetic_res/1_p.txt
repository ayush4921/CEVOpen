0: All nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE 400 Fourier transform spectrometer (Bruker, Wissembourg, France) operating at 400.132 MHz for  1H and 100.623 MHz for  13C, equipped with a 5 mm probe, in CDCl 3, with all shifts referred to internal TMS.
1: The  1H-NMR spectra were recorded with the following parameters: pulse width (PW), 4.3 s; relaxation delay 1 s and acquisition time 2.6 s for 32 K data table with a spectral width (SW) of 6000 Hz.
2: 13C-NMR spectra of the oil samples and fractions of CC were recorded with the following parameters: pulse width = 4 s (flip angle 45); acquisition time = 2.7 s for 128 K data table with a spectral width of 25,000 Hz (250 ppm); CPD mode decoupling; digital resolution = 0.183 Hz/pt.
3: Standard pulse sequences from Bruker Topspin TM (Bruker, Wissembourg, France) library were used for two-dimensional spectra.
4: Gradient-enhanced sequences were used for the heteronuclear two-dimensional experiments.
5: Spectra were processed via Mestrelab MestreNOVA software (version 12.0.0-20080).
