0: The essential oil samples (S1 and S2) were obtained by hydrodistillation of fresh leaves for 3 h using a Clevenger-type apparatus.
1: Yields were calculated from fresh material ( w/ w).
2: The oil sample S2 (2.9 g) was repeatedly fractionated by column chromatography (CC) as shown on  Scheme 1, using a gradient of solvents,  n-pentane: diethyl ether of increasing polarity.
3: Silica gel (200500 m, 90 g) was used to afford the first eight fractions.
4: Fractions F4 and F5 were again fractionated with silica gel (60200 m, 20 g each).
5: Sub-fractions F4.2, F4.3 and F5.2 were then fractionated with silica gel (3570 m, 10, 6 and 10 g, respectively).
6: Lastly, sub-fraction F5.3 was submitted to a Sephadex LH-20 column (3.0 g) using chloroform.
7: Compound  38 (98.7%) was the main constituent of sub-fraction F4.3.1.
8: Sub-fraction F5.3.1 contained compound  56 (98.3%) and sub-fraction F5.3.3 contained compounds  52 and  53, both accounting for 99.4% (ratio 7/3).
