<p>The essential oil samples (S1 and S2) were obtained by hydrodistillation of fresh leaves for 3 h using a Clevenger-type apparatus. Yields were calculated from fresh material (
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic>). The oil sample S2 (2.9 g) was repeatedly fractionated by column chromatography (CC) as shown on 
 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="molecules-25-05613-sch001">Scheme 1</xref>, using a gradient of solvents, 
 <italic>n</italic>-pentane: diethyl ether of increasing polarity. Silica gel (200–500 μm, 90 g) was used to afford the first eight fractions. Fractions F4 and F5 were again fractionated with silica gel (60–200 μm, 20 g each). Sub-fractions F4.2, F4.3 and F5.2 were then fractionated with silica gel (35–70 μm, 10, 6 and 10 g, respectively). Lastly, sub-fraction F5.3 was submitted to a Sephadex LH-20 column (3.0 g) using chloroform. Compound 
 <bold>38</bold> (98.7%) was the main constituent of sub-fraction F4.3.1. Sub-fraction F5.3.1 contained compound 
 <bold>56</bold> (98.3%) and sub-fraction F5.3.3 contained compounds 
 <bold>52</bold> and 
 <bold>53</bold>, both accounting for 99.4% (ratio 7/3).
