0: Identification of individual components was carried out: (i) by comparison of their GC retention indices (RI) on polar and apolar columns with those of reference compounds [ 24, 25]; (ii) on computer matching against commercial mass spectral libraries [ 26, 27]; (iii) on comparison of the signals in the  13C-NMR spectra of the mixtures with those of reference spectra compiled in the laboratory spectral library, with the help of laboratory-made software [ 15, 16].
1: This method allowed the identification of individual components of the essential oil at content as low as 0.40.5%.
