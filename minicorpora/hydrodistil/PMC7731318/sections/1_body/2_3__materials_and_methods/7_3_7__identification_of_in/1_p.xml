<p>Identification of individual components was carried out: (i) by comparison of their GC retention indices (RI) on polar and apolar columns with those of reference compounds [

 <xref rid="B25-molecules-25-05613" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]; (ii) on computer matching against commercial mass spectral libraries [

 <xref rid="B27-molecules-25-05613" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]; (iii) on comparison of the signals in the 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectra of the mixtures with those of reference spectra compiled in the laboratory spectral library, with the help of laboratory-made software [
