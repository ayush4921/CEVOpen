<p>The essential oil samples and all fractions of chromatography were analyzed with a PerkinElmer TurboMass detector (quadrupole), directly coupled with a PerkinElmer Autosystem XL (PerkinElmer, Courtaboeuf, France), equipped with a Rtx-1 (polydimethylsiloxane) fused-silica capillary column (60 m × 0.22 mm i.d., film thickness 0.25 µm). The oven temperature was programmed from 60 to 230 °C at 2°/min and then held isothermal for 45 min; injector temperature, 250 °C; ion-source temperature, 250 °C; carrier gas, He (1 mL/min); split ratio, 1:80; injection volume, 0.2 µL; ionization energy, 70 eV. The electron ionization (EI) mass spectra were acquired over the mass range 35–350 Da.</p>
