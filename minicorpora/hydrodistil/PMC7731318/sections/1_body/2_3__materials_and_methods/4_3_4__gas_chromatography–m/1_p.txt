0: The essential oil samples and all fractions of chromatography were analyzed with a PerkinElmer TurboMass detector (quadrupole), directly coupled with a PerkinElmer Autosystem XL (PerkinElmer, Courtaboeuf, France), equipped with a Rtx-1 (polydimethylsiloxane) fused-silica capillary column (60 m  0.22 mm i.d., film thickness 0.25 m).
1: The oven temperature was programmed from 60 to 230 C at 2/min and then held isothermal for 45 min; injector temperature, 250 C; ion-source temperature, 250 C; carrier gas, He (1 mL/min); split ratio, 1:80; injection volume, 0.2 L; ionization energy, 70 eV.
2: The electron ionization (EI) mass spectra were acquired over the mass range 35350 Da.
