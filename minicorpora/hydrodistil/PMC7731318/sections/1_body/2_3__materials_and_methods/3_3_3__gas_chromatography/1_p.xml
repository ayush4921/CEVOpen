<p>Analyses were performed on a Clarus 500 PerkinElmer Chromatograph (PerkinElmer, Courtaboeuf, France), equipped with flame ionization detector (FID) and two fused-silica capillary columns (50 m × 0.22 mm, film thickness 0.25 µm), BP-1 (polydimethylsiloxane) and BP-20 (polyethylene glycol). The oven temperature was programmed from 60 °C to 220 °C at 2 °C/min and then held isothermal at 220 °C for 20 min; injector temperature: 250 °C; detector temperature: 250 °C; carrier gas: helium (0.8 mL/min); split: 1/60; injected volume: 0.5 µL. Retention indices (RI) were determined relative to the retention times of a series of

The relative response factor (RFF) of each compound was calculated according to the IOFI recommended practice for the use of predicted relative response factors for the rapid quantification of volatile flavoring compounds by GC(FID) [
