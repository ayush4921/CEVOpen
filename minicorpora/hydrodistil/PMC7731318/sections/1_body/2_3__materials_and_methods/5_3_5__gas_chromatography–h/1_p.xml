<p>High-resolution EI-mass spectra were recorded using an Agilent 7200 GC-QTOF system (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with an Agilent J&amp;W, VF-waxMS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm; 0.25 μm film thickness). The mass spectrometer was operating at 70 eV with an acquisition rate of 2 GHz over a 35−450 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> range, affording a resolution of ∼8000. Injection volume 1 μL; split ratio 1:20; inlet temperature 250 °C, detector temperature 230 °C; column flow (He) 1.2 mL/min; temperature program for oven 60 °C (5 min isotherm) to 240 °C at 5 °C/min, then 10 min isotherm at 240 °C.
