0: High-resolution EI-mass spectra were recorded using an Agilent 7200 GC-QTOF system (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with an Agilent J&W, VF-waxMS capillary column (30 m  0.25 mm; 0.25 m film thickness).
1: The mass spectrometer was operating at 70 eV with an acquisition rate of 2 GHz over a 35450  m/ z range, affording a resolution of 8000.
2: Injection volume 1 L; split ratio 1:20; inlet temperature 250 C, detector temperature 230 C; column flow (He) 1.2 mL/min; temperature program for oven 60 C (5 min isotherm) to 240 C at 5 C/min, then 10 min isotherm at 240 C.
