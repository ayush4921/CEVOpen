0: Free radicals of oxygen and nitrogen are continuously produced during metabolism in animal and human bodies.
1: They are very reactive, however, human body can efficiently detoxify them within seconds.
2: Sometime reactive oxygen species are produced in larg quantities that harms the biologically important molecules leading to pathological conditions like stroke, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, inflammation, aging, cancer, and neurological disorders [ 4].
3: Any substance that can scavenge the reactive oxygen species is known as antioxidant.
4: Due to resonance stabilization effect in benzene rings, phenolic compounds can effectively scavenge the free radicals [ 5].
5: Literature studies have revealed that the use of polyphenolic compounds present in fruits, tea, and vegetables can effectively minimize the risk of the mentioned diseases [ 6].
6: The most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder is Alzheimer s disease (AD) characterized by low level of cholinergic transmission, deposition of -amyloid, and increased oxidative stress [ 7].
7: This cholinergic deficit is due to degradation of neurotransmitters acetylcholine (ACh) by two enzymes acetyl cholinesterase (AChE) and butyryl cholinesterase (BChE).
8: Inhibition of these two enzymes are used as strategy to maintain the level of ACh in body which would consequently relieve the symptoms associated with AD, Dementia and Parkinson s disease [ 8].
9: The consumption of edible plants/vegetables throughout the world has enormously increased as they are chief sources of phenolic compounds and even out of the five recommended drugs used for the treatment of AD, two are plant phytochemicals [ 9].
