0: The -glucosidase inhibition potential of essential oil of  E. umbellata were evaluated according to the reported assay [ 26] with some modifications.
1: The reaction mixture was formulated by adding 100 L of -glucosidase (0.5 unit/mL), 600 L of phosphate buffer (0.1 M; pH 6.9) and 50 L of essential oil dilutions (31.05, 62.5, 125, 250, 500 and 1000 g/mL).
2: To initiate the reaction 100 L  p-nitro-phenyl--D-glucopyranoside (5 mM) solution was added into each reaction mixture.
3: The resulting mixtures were incubated at 37 C for 15 min.
4: Then the reaction was stopped by the addition of 400 L sodium carbonate (0.2 M) solution and the absorbance of mixture was recorded at 405 nm.
5: Acarbose (2100 g/mL) was used as positive control.
6: The reaction mixture with no essential oil was used as a negative control while the blank solution was prepared without -glucosidase.
7: The IC 50 values of essential oil sample were calculated by plotting % -glucosidase inhibition as a function of concentration.
8: The % -glucosidase inhibition potential was calculated using following equation.
