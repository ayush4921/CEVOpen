0: Anticholinesterase inhibition potential of essential oil of  E. umbellata were determined spectrophotometrically using the reported standard Ellman assay [ 25].
1: Acetyl choline iodide and butyrylcholine iodide were used as substrates.
2: About 205 L of essential oil having concentration in the range of 31.051000 g/mL were added to a cuvette containing 5 L of AChE (0.03 U/mL) and BChE (0.01 U/mL), through micropipette.
3: Then 5 L of DTNB was added to mixture kept in a water bath at 30 C. After incubation for 15 min, 5 L of substrates (acetylthiocholine iodide or butyrylthiocholine iodide) were added to the mixtures that resulted in yellow coloration (5-Thio-2-nitro benzoate anion color).
4: Then the absorbance was recorded at 412 nm using double beam spectrophotometer (Thermo electron corporation, USA).
5: A blank solution was prepared containing only essential oil but no enzyme.
6: Galantamine was used as a positive control for which same procedure mentioned above was used.
7: The absorption of each sample was recorded for 4 min.
8: Percent enzyme activity and percent inhibition was calculated using the following equations:  3(a)\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$ V=\Delta Abs/\Delta t. $$\end{document}V=Abs/t.3(b)\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$ \% enzyme\ activity=\frac{V}{Vmax}\times 100.
