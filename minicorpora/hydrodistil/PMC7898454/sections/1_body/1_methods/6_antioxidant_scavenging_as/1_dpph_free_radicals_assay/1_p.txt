0: Brand-Williams assay [ 22] was used with some modification to check the scavenging potential of essential oil of  E. umbellata against DPPH (2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) free radical.
1: To prepare DPPH solution, 24 mg of it were dissolved in 100 mL methanol.
2: Approximately, 1 mg/mL stock solution of essential oil was also prepared in methanol and serially diluted to obtain the dilution having concentrations; 1000, 500, 250, 125, 62.5 and 31.05 g/mL.
3: Subsequently 0.1 mL of each dilution was mixed with 3 mL of DPPH solution.
4: The mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 25 C. Absorbance was measured at wave length 517 nm through UV spectrophotometer (Thermo Electron Corporation; USA) and ascorbic acid was used as a positive control.
5: All the samples were analysed in triplicates and the results are presented as Mean  SEM.
6: Percent DPPH scavenging potential was calculated using the following equation:  2\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$ Percent\ Scavenging\ potential=\frac{\boldsymbol{Blank}\ \boldsymbol{sample}\ \boldsymbol{absorbance}-\boldsymbol{sampleabsorbance}}{\boldsymbol{Blank}\ \boldsymbol{sample}\ \boldsymbol{absorbance}}\times 100 $$\end{document}Percent Scavenging potential=Blank sample absorbancesampleabsorbanceBlank sample absorbance100
