0: The -amylase inhibition potential was determined using 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNSA) assay [ 27].
1: About 1 mg/mL stock solution of essential oil of  E. umbellata was dissolved in 10% DMSO, 0.02 M Na 2HPO 4/NaH 2PO 4 buffer and 0.006 M NaCl at pH 6.9.
2: The stock solution of essential oil was serially diluted in the range of 31.051000 g/mL.
3: Then 200 L of -amylase (2 units/mL) solution was mixed with 200 L essential oil and incubated at 30 C for 10 min.
4: Subsequently 200 L starch (1% in water; w/v) solution was added to each dilution following incubation for 3 min.
5: The reaction was stopped by adding 200 L sodium potassium tartrate tetrahydrate dissolved in 8 mL NaOH (2 M) and 20 mL 3, 5 dinitrosalicylicacid (96 mM).
6: The mixture was boiled for 10 min in a water bath at 8590 C. After cooling the mixture was diluted with 5 mL distilled water.
7: The absorbance was recorded at 540 nm using UV-visible spectrophotometer.
8: A blank solution was prepared containing only essential oil but no enzyme.
9: Standard acarbose (2100 g/mL) was used as positive control.
10: The same procedure mentioned above was used to prepare reaction mixture of positive control and absorbance was measured at 540 nm.
11: The IC 50 values of essential oil sample were calculated by plotting % -amylase inhibition as a function of concentration.
12: The -amylase enzyme inhibition potential was calculated using the eq.
13: 4.
