0: The identification of major constituents of essential oil was done by comparison of their retention times and retention indices with those of authentic compounds reported in the literature.
1: The essential oil components were identified by comparing their retention indices and mass spectral fragmentation patterns the compounds present with those reported in the Wiley and NIST libraries, mass spectral library, and also with mass spectral data reported in the literature [ 20,  21].
2: Kovats retention indices were also determined using formula:  1\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$ RIx=100n+100\left( tx- tn\right)/\left( tn+1- tn\right) $$\end{document}RIx=100n+100txtn/tn+1-tn
