0: Essential oil of  E. umbellata were analysed by means of an Agilent USB-393752 gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA).
1: The instrument have the arrangement to effectively vaporizes the sample (the gas phase) and separates its various components using HP-5MS 5% phenyl methyl siloxane capillary column (30 m  0.25 mm  0.25 m film thickness; Restek, Bellefonte, PA) and was equipped with an FID detector for phytoconstituents identification.
2: The oven temperature was set first at 70 C for 1 min, and then increased to 180 C at the rate of 6 C/min for 5 min and lastly to 280 C for 20 min at the rate of 5 C/min.
3: Injector temperature was set at 220 C while detector temperatures was set at 290 C. The diluted samples (1/1000 in  n-pentane, v/v) having volume 1 L were injected manually in the split-less mode.
4: Helium (49.6 psi) was used as carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 mL/min which propelled the compounds and also act as reagent gas that causes charge-exchange chemical ionization of the analytes which are then separated on the basis of mass-to-charge ( m/z) ratios.
5: These components are then identified through comparison with known standards in literature [ 20].
