0: All the experiments were performed in three replicates.
1: Two way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni Post-test (to determine the values of P) were applied to establish the statistical differences between standard drug and test samples using Graph Pad Prism software.
2: The results were represented as Mean  SEM.
3: The results for which  P < 0.05 were considered as significant.
4: The medium inhibitory concentration (IC 50) of DPPH, ABTS, AChE, BChE, -glucosidase, and -amylase enzyme were determined using linear regression analysis using MS Excel program 2007.
5: R 2 values that were used to establish correlation between the biological potentials (antioxidant and inhibition of AChE, BChE, -glucosidase, and -amylase) of essential oil samples and the respective standards used in the study, were calculated using Excel 2007.
