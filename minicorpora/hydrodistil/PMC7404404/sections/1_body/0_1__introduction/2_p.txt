3: Lactuca taraxacifolia (Willd.)
4: Schumach, wild lettuce) is a leafy vegetable plant belonging to the Asteraceae (Compositae).
5: The family consists of roughly 1100 genera, and 20,000 species distributed across several countries including Mexico, West Indies, Central and South America, Europe, North Africa, and tropical West African countries like Ghana, Senegal, Benin, and Nigeria [ 18].
6: L. taraxacifolia is a wild erect perennial herb that grows up to 13 m in height with 35 pinnately lobed leaves at the base of the stem in a rosette form.
7: The plant is found singly or in clusters of rocky soil, but it is also cultivated in small open gardens near homes for family consumption.
8: The leaves are eaten fresh as a salad or cooked as sauces [ 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24].
9: The plant is known as efo yanrin among the Yorubas of the southwestern part of Nigeria, ugu among the Ibos of the eastern part of Nigeria, and nonon barya among the Hausas of the northern part of Nigeria.
10: Minerals, proteins, flavonoids, fatty acids, and vitamins have been reported to be found in the leaves of  L. taraxacifolia [ 25, 26].
11: The nutritional aspects of  L. taraxacifolia have been reviewed [ 27, 28].
12: The antioxidant and antiviral activities as well as the use of  L. taraxacifolia leaves in treatment and control of blood cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and diabetes have been reported [ 29, 30].
13: Phytochemical studies of  L. taraxacifolia revealed that the plant possesses chemical classes such as phenolic glycosides, flavonoids, saponins and triterpenoids, which are known to have phytotherapeutic value for humans [ 25, 31, 32, 33, 34].
14: To the best of our knowledge, there is little or no information on the composition of the essential oil or the insecticidal activity of  L. taraxacifolia.
15: Therefore, the present research was undertaken with the aim of investigating the essential oil composition and evaluating the insecticidal potential of  L. taraxacifolia leaves from southwestern Nigeria.
