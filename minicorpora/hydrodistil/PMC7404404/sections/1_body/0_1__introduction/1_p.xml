<p>Insects such as

 <italic>S. zeamais</italic> (Motsch.) (maize weevil), and 
 <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> (Herbst) (red flour beetle), are important pests that attack stored grains, causing widespread economic losses [

 <xref rid="B3-foods-09-00914" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The long-term use of synthetic insecticides to control these pests has become problematic, however. Compounds such as chlorinated hydrocarbons, organophosphates, carbamates, etc., tend to be toxic to non-target organisms such as mammals, birds, and fish [

Essential oils have emerged as viable alternatives to synthetic pesticides for control of stored-grain insect pests; they are generally non-toxic to mammals, birds, fish, or humans, have limited persistence, are readily biodegradable, and are renewable resources [
