<p>The essential oil was screened for insecticidal activity based on the method of Ilboudo and co-workers [

 <italic>Sitophilus oryzae</italic> (L.) (rice weevil) were reared on whole rice (10:1 w/w). Adult insects, 1–7 days old, were used for contact toxicity tests. The insects were cultured in a dark growth chamber at a temperature of 27 ± 1 °C with relative humidity of 65 ± 5%. The insecticidal activity of 
 <italic>L. taraxacifolia</italic> oil against 
 <italic>S. oryzae</italic> (rice weevil) was evaluated by treatment of Whatman No. 1 filter paper discs with the essential oil diluted in ethanol. The required quantities of oil (0.10, 0.20, 0.30, and 0.40 µL) were diluted to 1 mL with ethanol and applied to filter paper discs, respectively. Permethrin (0.6% w/w) and ethanol were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. The solvent was allowed to evaporate from the filter paper, which was then placed into polyethylene cups (80 mm diameter). Ten well-fed mixed sex adult 
 <italic>S. oryzae</italic> were introduced into the polyethylene cups, containing 20 g uninfected rice grains, and covered with a muslin cloth, held in place with rubber bands. Each treatment was replicated four times. Control experiments were set up as described as above without the essential oil. The experiment was arranged in a complete randomized design on a laboratory bench. The insect was considered dead when the legs or antennae were observed to be immobile. Insect mortalities were investigated by observing the recovery of immobilized insects after 24 h intervals for 120 h and the percentage of insect mortality was corrected using the Abbott formula [

 <xref rid="B42-foods-09-00914" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] using XLSTAT version 2018.1.1.60987 (Addinsoft™, Paris, France) was used to estimate median lethal concentration (LC
 <sub>50</sub>) values and insect toxicity data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA Tukey’s honestly significant difference test.
