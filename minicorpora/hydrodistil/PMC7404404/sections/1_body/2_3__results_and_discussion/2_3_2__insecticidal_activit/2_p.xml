<p>Median lethal concentration (LC
 <sub>50</sub>) values at 95% confidence limits over exposure of 
 <italic>L. taraxacifolia</italic> essential oil were assessed and are shown in 
 <xref rid="foods-09-00914-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. After 120 h of exposure with an increase in concentration at regular intervals of 24 h, the LC
 <sub>50</sub> values were 54.38, 31.64, 21.48, 16.38, and 10.10 ÂµL/mL, respectively. In this study, the essential oil of 
 <italic>L. taraxacifolia</italic> demonstrated contact toxicity to 
 <italic>S. oryzae</italic>, since it had higher insecticidal activity with increasing essential oil concentration and exposure time. This result showed 
 <italic>L. taraxacifolia</italic> essential oil to have promising insecticidal activity against 
 <italic>S. oryzae</italic> and therefore may be considered as a useful, environmentally benign alternative to synthetic insecticides.
