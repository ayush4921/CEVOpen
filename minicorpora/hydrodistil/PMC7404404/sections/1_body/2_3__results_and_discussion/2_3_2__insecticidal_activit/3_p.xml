<p>To best of our knowledge, there have been no previous literature reports on the insecticidal activity of 
 <italic>L. taraxacifolia</italic> essential oil against 
 <italic>S. oryzae</italic> insect pest. However, contact toxicity of both limonene and sabinene, the major chemical components in this present study, have shown insecticidal activity against 
 <italic>S. oryzae</italic> [
 <xref rid="B44-foods-09-00914" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Limonene has been previously reported to have a moderate contact effect against 
 <italic>S. zeamais</italic> (LD
 <sub>50</sub> values of 198.66 μg/cm
 <sup>2</sup>) and 
 <italic>S. oryzae</italic> (with LD
 <sub>50</sub> of 260.18 μg/cm
 <sup>2</sup>) [
 <xref rid="B45-foods-09-00914" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] as well as fumigant toxicity against 
 <italic>S. oryzae</italic> (24-h LC
 <sub>50</sub> 61.5 μL/L) [
 <xref rid="B46-foods-09-00914" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Garcia et al. reported that limonene showed contact toxicity against 
 <italic>T. castaneum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B47-foods-09-00914" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Sabinene, on the other hand, demonstrated weaker insecticidal activity against 
 <italic>S. oryzae</italic> (24-h LC
 <sub>50</sub> 463 μL/L) [
 <xref rid="B44-foods-09-00914" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Interestingly, the 
 <italic>S. oryzae</italic> fumigant insecticidal activities of limonene and sabinene parallel the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activities; AChE IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 9.57 μL/mL and 85.03 μL/mL, respectively, for limonene and sabinene [
 <xref rid="B48-foods-09-00914" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Furthermore, the binary combination of limonene + sabinene showed synergistic AChE inhibition [
 <xref rid="B48-foods-09-00914" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The insecticidal activity of the 
 <italic>L. taraxacifolia</italic> essential oil could be attributed to those known major components and the resulting synergistic action of the monoterpene hydrocarbons limonene (48.8%) and sabinene (18.8%).
