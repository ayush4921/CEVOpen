    "This study was done to evaluate the effects of different concentrations of <i>Ziziphora clinopodioides</i> essential oil (ZCEO) (0, 0.1, and 0.3%) and lysozyme (0 and 400 µg/g) on control of <i>Listeria</i> (L.) <i>monocytogenes</i> and also microbial, chemical, and organoleptic properties of Balkan type fresh sausage under modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) during 13-day storage at refrigerated condition. Results revealed that treated sausages had a slower rate of increase in microbial count than control and sausages containing ZCEO (0.3%) and lysozyme (400 µg/g) possess the lowest microbial count at the end of the storage period. A reduction between 0.90 and 2.05 log CFU/g in <i>L. monocytogenes</i> was recorded for the treated sausage samples in comparison with control samples after 13 days of storage. Based on chemical findings, at the end of the storage, TVB-<i>N</i> value in the control sample gradually increased to 34.30 mg/100 g, whereas TVB-N values of the treated samples with each of the lysozyme and ZCEO alone or in combination were below 25 mg/100 g during the entire storage period. The final TBARS value for the control sample was 0.58 mg malondialdehyde/kg, while the TBARS values for the treated samples remained lower as 0.46 mg malondialdehyde/kg. Regarding sensory attributes, adding ZCEO results in insignificant lower scores in odor and taste than control in the early days of the study (<i>p</i> > .05). It can be argued that ZCEO alone or in combination with lysozyme showed good antimicrobial and antioxidant activities and may have this potential to be used as a preservative in fresh sausage without any significant adverse sensory effects (<i>p</i> > .05)."
