<p>The major constitutes of used ZCEO in the current study were geraniol (20.62%), carvacrol (18.17%), alpha‐terpineol (7.49%), 4‐terpineol (6.83%) and borneol (3.67%), and gamma‐terpinene (3.53%). The amount of carvacrol and thymol in used essential oil is in accordance with previous studies which showed that carvacrol and thymol are the major components of ZCEO (Aghajani et al.,
