<p>It was documented that in vacuum and MAP condition, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are among the most common microorganisms associated with spoilage of meat and fresh sausage (Carballo et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32141-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>; Pothakos et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32141-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Metabolizing of amino acids by LAB and producing organic acids, ammonia, and biogenic amines result in off
 <italic>‐</italic>flavor such as sour or putrid flavor in fresh sausage (Carballo et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32141-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). In our study, the initial count of LAB in fresh sausage sample was 3.05 log CFU/g and its final population decreased significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) in samples containing ZCEO alone or in combination with lysozyme compared with control sample (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32141-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). With regard to the use of MAP and antimicrobial compounds in fresh sausage, present results are in general agreement with those of Mastromatteo et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn32141-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>), who reported a significant reduction in LAB of Salsiccia, a type of fresh Italian sausage, after adding of thymol and the packaging with MAP (20% CO
 <sub>2</sub>, 5% O
 <sub>2</sub>, 75% N
 <sub>2</sub>) (Mastromatteo et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32141-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). Similar results were noted by Da Silveira et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn32141-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>) who found that adding bay leaf EO (0.05 and 0.1%) to fresh Tuscan sausage led to a significant decrease in LAB till day 6 of storage (da Silveira et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32141-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). Conversely, Carballo et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn32141-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>) reported that LAB count in fresh Balkan sausage treated with 0.1% 
 <italic>Zataria multiflora</italic> EO did not show any significant decrease versus. control samples (Carballo et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32141-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). The possible reasons for the observed differences in LAB count can be attributed to the differences in used meat since in the current study the meat composed of equal content of beef and lamb meat whereas in Carballo et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn32141-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>) only lamb meat was used and higher amount of fat in lamb than beef results in protecting bacteria against EO (Perricone et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32141-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>; Smith‐Palmer et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32141-bib-0056" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>).
