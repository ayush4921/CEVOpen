<p>The effect of ZCEO and lysozyme on the growth of 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> in fresh sausage during storage time is given in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32141-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>. It is shown that 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> count in samples containing different concentrations of ZCEO and lysozyme was reduced significantly (0.9–2.05 log CFU/g) in comparison with the control after 13 days of storage. In a related study, Mastromatteo et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn32141-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>) reported a significant reduction in 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> count by adding a combination of lysozyme (250 ppm), nisin (250 ppm), and disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (20 mM) in ostrich patties stored at 4°C for 8 days (Mastromatteo et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32141-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). However, contradictory findings were reported by Hughey et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn32141-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">1989</xref>) who found out adding 100 µg/ml of lysozyme to fresh sausages (bratwurst) inoculated with 3.60 log CFU/g of 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> did not show any significant differences in comparison with control (Hughey et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32141-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">1989</xref>). The possible reason for the observed difference in 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> count with our study is due to the concentration of used lysozyme.
