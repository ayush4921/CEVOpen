<p>It can be argued that the reasons for the higher count of TMC, PSB, LAB, and 
 <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> in this study with regard to using MAP in comparison with some studies may be due to the procedure of preparation of Balkan‐style fresh sausage that minced meat was refrigerated for 24 hr after grinding and this can make an appropriate condition for microorganisms to grow. Besides, in the formulation of this sausage, adding 3% water leads to an increase in a
 <sub>w</sub> of sausage. Furthermore, it was documented that MAP packaging composed of 20% CO
 <sub>2</sub> and 80% N
 <sub>2</sub> and absence of oxygen leads to an inhibitory effect on obligate aerobic microorganisms, as well as dissolving CO
 <sub>2</sub> in water composition of meat and producing carbonic acid alters the interior pH of bacterial cells and suppress the growth of them. In the process of sausage production in the current study, bicarbonate sodium was added based on the recipe and this compound has buffering activity; thus, the intracellular pH does not change.
