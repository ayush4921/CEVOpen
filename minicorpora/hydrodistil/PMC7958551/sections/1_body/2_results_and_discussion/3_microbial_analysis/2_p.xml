<p>Changes in total mesophilic counts (TMC) of fresh sausage samples during refrigerated storage under MAP condition are illustrated in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32141-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. The initial TMC of the fresh sausage sample was 4.08 log CFU/g and gradually increased to 8.32 log CFU/g at the end of storage. It was mentioned that TMCs of sampled fresh breakfast‐type sausages in Canada varied between 3.18 and 8.32 logs CFU/g with a mean of 5.65 log CFU/g depending on the formulation (Farber et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32141-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">1988</xref>). Overall, there was a significant decrease in TMCs of sausage samples containing lysozyme alone comparing with control (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), except for days 2 and 9. TMCs of the samples enriched with the ZCEO and lysozyme alone or in combination reduced significantly in comparison with control (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Also, adding ZCEO at a concentration of 0.3% alone or at concentrations of 0.1 and 0.3% combined with lysozyme into fresh sausage resulted in TMC below 7 log CFU/g until the thirteenth day. Similar results were reported by Da Silveira et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn32141-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>) who noted TMCs of fresh Tuscan sausage were significantly lower (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) in the treated samples with 0.1% concentration of 
 <italic>Laurus nobilis</italic> than in the control (da Silveira et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32141-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). With regard to the use of EOs in fresh sausage, the results of the current study are also in general agreement with those of Sojic et al. (2018), who reported that the addition of 
 <italic>Salvia officinalis</italic> L. EO and 
 <italic>Salvia officinalis</italic> L. extract significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) reduced TMC (Šojić et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32141-bib-0057" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). A similar finding was found by Zhang et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn32141-bib-0062" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>), who noted that TMCs were lower at 0.1% and 0.5% CinnamonEO treatment in comparison with control (Zhang et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32141-bib-0062" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). Gammariello et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn32141-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>) reported shelf life (according to TMC) about 18 days for fresh sausage by combining the dipping of meat first in sodium lactate solution (60%), then in optimal concentrations of EOs (1.25% fennel and 2.5% black pepper; 2.5% bay and 1.25% nutmeg), and packaging with MAP (30% CO
 <sub>2</sub> and 70% N
 <sub>2</sub>) (Gammariello et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32141-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>).
