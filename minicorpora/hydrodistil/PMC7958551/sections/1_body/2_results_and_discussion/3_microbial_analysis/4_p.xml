<p>The growth of psychrotrophic bacteria (PSB) under low temperature has a key role in reducing the shelf life of proteinaceous products (Shavisi et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32141-bib-0053" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). In the current study, the initial count of PSB in the fresh sausage was 3.28 log CFU/g and its final population decreased significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) (approximately 1.1–1.98 log CFU/g) in treated samples compared with the control sample (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32141-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Nattress et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn32141-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>) evaluated the effect of lysozyme on two major spoilage psychrotrophic bacteria (
 <italic>Brochotrix thermosphacta</italic> B2 and 
 <italic>Carnobacterium</italic> sp. 845), and their results revealed that lysozyme at a concentration of 500 μg/ml is able to inhibit 
 <italic>Brochotrix thermosphacta</italic> B2 in pork juice whereas it showed no antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic>Carnobacterium</italic> sp. 845 at concentrations of 1,000 μg/ml (Nattress et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32141-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>). Therefore, it can be argued that lysozyme is capable to affect the growth of some psychrotrophic bacteria. Regarding the use of ZCEO, the results of the present study were in line with Sirocchi et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn32141-bib-0055" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>), who noted that the PSB count of beef decreased as 1.6 log CFU/g by the combination of MAP (50% O
 <sub>2</sub> + 30% CO
 <sub>2</sub> + 20% N
 <sub>2</sub>) plus 
 <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> L. EO in comparison with control (Sirocchi et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32141-bib-0055" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Da Silveira et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn32141-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>) also reported that PSB populations were significantly lower (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) in the treated fresh sausage samples with bay leaf EO than in the control, except for days 0 and 4 (da Silveira et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32141-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). However, the contradictory finding was declared by Araújo et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn32141-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>), who reported that treating fresh sausage with a combination of garlic EO (0.0125 μl/ml), nisin (0.24 mg/ml), and allyl isothiocyanate (0.0125 μl/ml) had no significant effect on PSB population compared with control (Araújo et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32141-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). These differences can be related to the variation between the antimicrobial activity of various essential oils, the concentration of used essential oil, and initial PSB population.
