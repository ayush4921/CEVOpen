<p>The spoilage and health hazards related to the growth of 
 <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> in meat and meat products such as fresh sausages under MAP condition should be considered (Al‐Mutairi, 
 <xref rid="fsn32141-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>; Ercolini et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32141-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>). Based on our findings, the initial 
 <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> count was 2.35 log CFU/g and reached 5.19 log CFU/g, and a significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) reduction in the final population of 
 <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> by adding ZCEO and lysozyme alone or in combination was observed (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32141-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Present results on 
 <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> evolution, regarding the use of essential oil, are in excellent agreement with those of Zhang et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn32141-bib-0062" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>) who mentioned that the addition of 0.1% or 0.5% cinnamon essential oil significantly decreased the counts of 
 <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> during 10‐day storage and also increasing EO concentration led to more reduction effect on 
 <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> count (Zhang et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32141-bib-0062" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). In the study carried out by Karabagias et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn32141-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>), it was illustrated that on day 9 of storage of lamb meat, 
 <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> reached 6 log CFU/g in control samples whereas in the presence of 0.1% thyme essential oil and MAP (80% CO
 <sub>2</sub>/20% N
 <sub>2</sub>), their population was reduced by 2.8 and 4.1 log CFU/g, respectively, as compared to controls (Karabagias et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32141-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). Del Nobile et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn32141-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>) declared that a significant decrease in 
 <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> count was observed in samples by the integration of thymol at concentration 500 and 750 ppm combined with MAP (40% O
 <sub>2</sub>, 15% CO
 <sub>2</sub>, and 45% N2) versus control samples in aerobic condition (Del Nobile et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32141-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>).
