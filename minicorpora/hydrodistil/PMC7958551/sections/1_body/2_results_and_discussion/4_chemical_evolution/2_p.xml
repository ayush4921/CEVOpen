<p>The mean protein and fat content of fresh sausages were 16.92% and 8.21%, respectively. It is proven that the TVB‐N index is a quantitative parameter that can be used to determine the freshness of meat and meat products (Zhang et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32141-bib-0062" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). The effect of ZCEO and lysozyme on the evolution of TVB‐N of fresh Balkan‐style sausage during the 13‐day storage at refrigerated temperature is shown in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn32141-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>. As it is illustrated, TVB‐
 <italic>N</italic> values enhanced in both control and treated samples during storage time; however, the values were significantly lower in the treated samples in comparison with control (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). The initial TVB‐N in the control sample was 10.21 mg/100 g which is in agreement with the previously reported results (Zhang et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32141-bib-0062" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>), and after 9 days of storage, it reached to 27.49 mg/100 g and gradually increased to 34.30 mg/100 g at the end of storage. TVB‐N of the treated samples with each of the lysozyme and ZCEO alone or in combination were below 25 mg/100 g during the entire storage period. Our finding was comparably well in line with other researches focused on the impact of herbal essential oils in the reduction of TVB‐N in fresh sausage (Zhang et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32141-bib-0062" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). The lower TVB‐N values in treated samples may be due to the antibacterial activates of examined preservative agents in retarding bacterial growth followed by a decrease in the amount of nonprotein nitrogen compounds such as ammonia, primary, secondary, and tertiary amines (Shavisi et al.,
