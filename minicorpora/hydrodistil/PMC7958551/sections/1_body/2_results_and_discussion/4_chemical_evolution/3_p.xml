<p>The second most known spoilage factor of fresh meat and fresh meat products is lipid oxidation or oxidative rancidity (Hugo &amp; Hugo, 
 <xref rid="fsn32141-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>; Wenjiao et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32141-bib-0061" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). It is documented that factors such as light, oxygen presence, chemical characteristics of the meat, storage temperature, and technological processes affect lipid oxidation (Hugo &amp; Hugo, 
 <xref rid="fsn32141-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Oxidation of fresh sausage lipids results in a decrease in its quality during the storage. The changes in TBARS values are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn32141-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>. The TBARS of the control treatment at the beginning of the study was 0.08 mg malondialdehyde/kg. In the control samples, the TBARS value reached to 0.58 mg malondialdehyde/kg, whereas the values for the treated samples remained lower as 0.46 mg malondialdehyde/kg. The results of this study revealed that under MAP condition during the entire storage period, the TBARS values of all samples did not exceed the reported threshold values for rancidity in meat products (Georgantelis et al.,

 <xref rid="fsn32141-bib-0057" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). The results of the current study were in line with the findings of Sharma et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn32141-bib-0051" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>) who noted that adding clove oil (0.25%), holy basil oil (0.125%), cassia oil (0.25%), and thyme oil (0.125%) to fresh chicken sausage led to a significant effect on TBARS values (Sharma et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32141-bib-0051" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>).
