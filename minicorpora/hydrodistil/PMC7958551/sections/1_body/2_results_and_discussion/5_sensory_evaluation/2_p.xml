<p>The results of the sensory analysis of fresh sausage samples are shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32141-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6a–c</xref>. Regarding organoleptic attributes, adding ZCEO results in insignificant lower scores in odor and taste than control in the early days of study (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05). But this early negative influence of the ZCEO on taste and odor parameters of the treated sausages diminished during the storage period. Also, by increasing microbial and chemical values of sausage, the scores given by panelists to odor, taste, and color of samples were declined during the study period. The reason for this phenomenon can be attributed to the inhibitory activity of the ZCEO and lysozyme on microbial growth during refrigeration condition. The growth of 
 <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>, homofermentative LAB, and 
 <italic>Brochothrix thermosphacta</italic> result in generation of some off‐flavor compounds such as acetoindiacetyl and 3‐methylbutanol. Also, LAB, 
 <italic>Enterobacteriaceae,</italic> and 
 <italic>Brochotrix thermosphacta</italic> are able to produce biogenic from enzymatic decarboxylation of free amino acids. These compounds lead to an unpleasant odor and taste. In addition, chemical compounds such as ketones and aldehydes resulted from lipid oxidation could be responsible for off‐flavors in stored sausages (Barbieri et al.,
