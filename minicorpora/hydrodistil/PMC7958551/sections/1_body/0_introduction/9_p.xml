<p>There are little, if any, published data on the use of 
 <italic>Ziziphora clinopodioides</italic> essential oil (ZCEO) and lysozyme for enhancing the safety and shelf life of fresh sausages. This study was done in order to investigate (i) the effects of ZCEO and lysozyme for the control of 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> inoculated (≃3 log CFU/g) in fresh sausage during a 13‐day storage period and (ii) the possibility of shelf life extension of fresh sausage using the above combination.
