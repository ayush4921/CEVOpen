<p>The fresh sausage was cooked by an electric grill in order to its core temperature reached 71°C. Random three‐digit blinded code samples (rectangular pieces approximately 2 cm × 1.5 cm with 1cm thickness were cut from the center of sausage samples) were evaluated by a 9‐member trained panel under similar location, light, and dish conditions. The order of sample presentation was randomized for each panelist and three replicates of all treatments were evaluated by them during the storage period. Palate cleansers, room temperature distilled water and unsalted crackers, were provided between samples (Araújo et al.,
