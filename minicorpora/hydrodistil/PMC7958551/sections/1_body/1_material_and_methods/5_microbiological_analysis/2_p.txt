0: Sausage samples (10  g) were homogenized with 90 ml of 0.1% sterile solution of peptone water for 2 min, using a stomacher (Interscience) at 6 intervals during storage time (0, 2, 4, 6, 9, and 13 days).
1: Afterward, appropriate decimal dilutions of each sample were prepared and cultivated in duplicate on the selected media and incubated, according to the procedure described by the culture media manufacturer, as follows: plate count agar (PCA) incubated at 30C for 72 hr for the enumeration of total mesophilic bacteria and incubated at 7C for 10 days for the enumeration of psychrotrophic bacteria; De Man, Rogosa and Sharpe agar (MRS agar) for lactic acid bacteria at 30C for 72 hr; Violet red bile glucose agar (VRBGA) for  Enterobactriacea at 37C for 24 hr; and Palcam agar for  L. monocytogenes at 30C for 48 hr (Carballo et al.,  2019; Esmaeili et al.,  2020; Rezaeigolestani et al.,  2017).
