<p>Sausage samples (10 
 <italic>g</italic>) were homogenized with 90 ml of 0.1% sterile solution of peptone water for 2 min, using a stomacher (Interscience) at 6 intervals during storage time (0, 2, 4, 6, 9, and 13 days). Afterward, appropriate decimal dilutions of each sample were prepared and cultivated in duplicate on the selected media and incubated, according to the procedure described by the culture media manufacturer, as follows: plate count agar (PCA) incubated at 30°C for 72 hr for the enumeration of total mesophilic bacteria and incubated at 7°C for 10 days for the enumeration of psychrotrophic bacteria; De Man, Rogosa and Sharpe agar (MRS agar) for lactic acid bacteria at 30°C for 72 hr; Violet red bile glucose agar (VRBGA) for
