<p>The total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB‐N) content of the sausage samples was assessed as previously described by Zhang et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn32141-bib-0062" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>) as follows: sausage sample (10 g) was transferred into Erlenmeyer flask, containing 100 ml distilled water, and was shook for 30 min, and then, the solution was centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 10 min. After that, the solution was filtered through the filter paper, and 5 ml of filtrate was mixed with 5 ml of 10 g/L magnesium oxide. Steam distillation was performed using a Kjeldahl distillation unit for about 5 min. The distillate was absorbed by 10 ml of 20 g/L boric acid and then titrated with 0.01 mol/L HCl (Zhang et al.,
