0: The thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) according to the method described by Nam and Ahn ( 2003) were as follows: Fresh sausage samples were transferred to 50ml test tubes containing 15 ml deionized distilled water (DDW) and homogenized for 15 s. After that, 1 ml of homogenized samples was transferred to disposable test tubes (13  100 mm) and then butylated hydroxytoluene (7.2% in ethanol, v/v, 50 ml) and thiobarbituric acid/trichloroacetic acid (20 mM TBA/15% TCA, w/v, 2 ml) solutions were added.
1: Next, the mixture for each sample was vortexed and placed in a 90C water bath for 15 min to develop color.
2: After cooling for 10 min in cold water, each sample was vortexed and centrifuged at 3,000  g for 15 min at 5C.
3: Finally, the absorbance of the resulting upper layer was read at 531 nm against a blank (1 ml DDW and 2 ml TBA/TCA solution).
4: The amounts of TBARS were expressed as mg of malondialdehyde (MDA) per kg sausage (Nam & Ahn,  2003).
