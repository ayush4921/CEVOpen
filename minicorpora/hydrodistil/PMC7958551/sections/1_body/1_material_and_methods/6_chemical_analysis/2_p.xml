<p>The thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) according to the method described by Nam and Ahn (
 <xref rid="fsn32141-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>) were as follows: Fresh sausage samples were transferred to 50‐ml test tubes containing 15 ml deionized distilled water (DDW) and homogenized for 15 s. After that, 1 ml of homogenized samples was transferred to disposable test tubes (13 × 100 mm) and then butylated hydroxytoluene (7.2% in ethanol, v/v, 50 ml) and thiobarbituric acid/trichloroacetic acid (20 mM TBA/15% TCA, w/v, 2 ml) solutions were added. Next, the mixture for each sample was vortexed and placed in a 90°C water bath for 15 min to develop color. After cooling for 10 min in cold water, each sample was vortexed and centrifuged at 3,000
