<p>The preparation of sausage was done based on the method described by Carballo et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn32141-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>) which was modified in the following way. To prepare each treatment, 500 g beef and 500 g lamb meat was minced by a meat grinder machine equipped with a 5‐mm‐diameter sieve. Then, both minced types of meats were mixed together and sodium chloride salt (20 g) was added and mixed again for 10 min, and then, it was placed into a bowl covered with cling film and stored under refrigeration condition for 24 hr. On the same day, a mixture of 10 g finely cut fresh garlic and 1g pepper was boiled in 30 ml water for 2 min, then filtered, and cooled at refrigeration condition for 24 hr. At the following day, the minced meat was mixed with spice solution and 3 g sodium bicarbonate and different concentrations of ZCEO (0, 0.1, and 0.3%) and lysozyme (0 and 400 µg/g) for 10 min. After mixing, each batch was stuffed into lamb casings (inoculation for 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> in selected batches was done before stuffing) and drained for 3 hr at 12°C. The sausages were divided into 100 g (for microbiological analysis) and 10 g portions (for 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> growth analysis), which were individually packaged in bags (150‐µm‐thickness plastic film, having an oxygen permeability of 30 cm
 <sup>3</sup>/24 hr m
 <sup>2</sup> bar at 23°C and 0% relative humidity) with modified atmosphere including 20% CO
 <sub>2</sub> and 80% N
 <sub>2</sub> and afterward stored at refrigeration condition (Carballo et al.,
