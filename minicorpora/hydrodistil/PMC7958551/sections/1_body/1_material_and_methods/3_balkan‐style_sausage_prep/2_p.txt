1: ( 2019) which was modified in the following way.
2: To prepare each treatment, 500 g beef and 500 g lamb meat was minced by a meat grinder machine equipped with a 5mmdiameter sieve.
3: Then, both minced types of meats were mixed together and sodium chloride salt (20 g) was added and mixed again for 10 min, and then, it was placed into a bowl covered with cling film and stored under refrigeration condition for 24 hr.
4: On the same day, a mixture of 10 g finely cut fresh garlic and 1g pepper was boiled in 30 ml water for 2 min, then filtered, and cooled at refrigeration condition for 24 hr.
5: At the following day, the minced meat was mixed with spice solution and 3 g sodium bicarbonate and different concentrations of ZCEO (0, 0.1, and 0.3%) and lysozyme (0 and 400 g/g) for 10 min.
6: After mixing, each batch was stuffed into lamb casings (inoculation for  L. monocytogenes in selected batches was done before stuffing) and drained for 3 hr at 12C.
7: The sausages were divided into 100 g (for microbiological analysis) and 10 g portions (for  L. monocytogenes growth analysis), which were individually packaged in bags (150mthickness plastic film, having an oxygen permeability of 30 cm 3/24 hr m 2 bar at 23C and 0% relative humidity) with modified atmosphere including 20% CO 2 and 80% N 2 and afterward stored at refrigeration condition (Carballo et al.,  2019).
