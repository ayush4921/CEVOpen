0: Listeria monocytogenes, American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) 19117, was refreshed according to the method described by Khanjari et al.
1: ( 2019) as follows: The lyophilized culture was transferred into tubes containing 10 ml of brainheart infusion (BHI) broth medium and incubated twice for 18 hr at 35C.
2: Preparation of inoculation dose was performed by adjusting optical density (OD) (absorbance) of second BHI broth culture of  L. monocytogenes to 0.1 at 600 nm longwave, using a Spectronic spectrophotometer (Jenway 6100, England).
3: After that, decimal diluting of the resulting culture (OD 600 nm = 0.1) by 9 ml of 0.1% sterile peptone water was done to obtain viable cell counts of approximately 5 log CFU/ml.
4: Finally, 100 l of suspension was inoculated in tenpoint of sausage ingredient (10 g) (Khanjari et al.,  2019).
