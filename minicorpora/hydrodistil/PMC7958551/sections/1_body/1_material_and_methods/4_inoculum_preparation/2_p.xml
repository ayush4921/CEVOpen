 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) 19117, was refreshed according to the method described by Khanjari et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn32141-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>) as follows: The lyophilized culture was transferred into tubes containing 10 ml of brain–heart infusion (BHI) broth medium and incubated twice for 18 hr at 35°C. Preparation of inoculation dose was performed by adjusting optical density (OD) (absorbance) of second BHI broth culture of 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> to 0.1 at 600 nm long‐wave, using a Spectronic spectrophotometer (Jenway 6100, England). After that, decimal diluting of the resulting culture (OD 600 nm = 0.1) by 9 ml of 0.1% sterile peptone water was done to obtain viable cell counts of approximately 5 log CFU/ml. Finally, 100 µl of suspension was inoculated in ten‐point of sausage ingredient (10 g) (Khanjari et al.,
