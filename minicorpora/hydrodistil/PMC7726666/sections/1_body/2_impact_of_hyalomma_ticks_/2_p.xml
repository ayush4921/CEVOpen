 <italic>Hyalomma</italic> ticks are medium to large in size and have long mouthparts through which the species cause tissue damage and predispose conditions for myiasis and tick pyaemia. Though 
 <italic>Hyalomma</italic> may cause significant impact through its painful bite, sucking of the large volume of blood leading to anaemia, tick worry and annoyance affecting the productivity of the animals but these parameters are rarely quantified. According to 
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Balashov (1972)</xref>, 
 <italic>H. asiaticium</italic> may take about 8.856 ml of blood for repletion. 
 <xref rid="bib191" ref-type="bibr">Sajid et al. (2007)</xref> assessed the direct effect of 
 <italic>Hyalomma</italic> ticks on animal productivity and reported an average daily increase of 1.15 L in milk yield per animal with 1.31 % more fat in acaricide-treated animals compared to 
 <italic>Hyalomma</italic> infested animals. Moreover, the salivary toxin may cause dermatitis, paralysis and lameness viz., bites of 
 <italic>H. asiaticum</italic> and 
 <italic>H. truncatum</italic> cause lameness to lambs (
