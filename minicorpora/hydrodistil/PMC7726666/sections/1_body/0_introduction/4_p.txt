0: Repeated applications of chemical acaricides are the backbone of tick management having limited efficacy ( Chema, 1990;  Pegram et al., 1991,  1993;  Meneghi et al., 2016).
1: The approach based on acaricide application suffers from many drawbacks such as repetition of applications, environmental pollution, acaricide residues in livestock products, selection of resistant ticks, non-availability of new generation acaricides in near future and high cost of development of new generation acaricides ( de la Fuente and Kocan, 2006).
2: It has been estimated that the cost of discovering and developing a novel product is around the US $ 100 million, with an average time requirement is 10 years ( Graf et al., 2004).
3: These issues enforced the scientific community to develop and introduce alternatives to acaricides that are consistent with the principles of sustainable TTBDs management ( Willadsen, 2006;  de la Fuente and Kocan, 2006;  Merino et al., 2011;  Ghosh et al., 2013).
4: The alternative approaches are strategic use of effective acaricides; adoption of the resistance monitoring system for identification of zone-specific effective acaricides; biological control; use of phytoformulation; vaccines.
5: The present review is focussed on direct and indirect impact  Hyalomma ticks and its possible management strategies.
