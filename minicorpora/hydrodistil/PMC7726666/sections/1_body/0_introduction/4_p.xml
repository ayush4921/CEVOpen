The approach based on acaricide application suffers from many drawbacks such as repetition of applications, environmental pollution, acaricide residues in livestock products, selection of resistant ticks, non-availability of new generation acaricides in near future and high cost of development of new generation acaricides (
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">de la Fuente and Kocan, 2006</xref>). It has been estimated that the cost of discovering and developing a novel product is around the US $ 100 million, with an average time requirement is 10 years (

The alternative approaches are strategic use of effective acaricides; adoption of the resistance monitoring system for identification of zone-specific effective acaricides; biological control; use of phytoformulation; vaccines. The present review is focussed on direct and indirect impact
