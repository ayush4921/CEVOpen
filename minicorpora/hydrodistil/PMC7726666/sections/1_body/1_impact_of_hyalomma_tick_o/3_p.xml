<p id="p0030">After mosquitoes, ticks are considered as the second most important arthropod vector in the transmission of pathogenic agents. In human, 
 <italic>Hyalomma</italic> ticks act as vector of CCHF virus (
 <xref rid="bib217" ref-type="bibr">Turell, 2007</xref>). Worldwide, 
 <italic>CCHFV</italic> has been reported in 15 species of 
 <italic>Hyalomma</italic> viz., 
 <italic>H. aegyptium, H. anatolicum, H. asiaticum, H. dromedarii, H. excavatum, H. impeltatum, H. impressum, H. lusitanicum, H. marginatum, H. nitidum, H. rufipes, H. schulzei, H. scupense, H. truncatum</italic> and 
 <italic>H. turanicum</italic> along with other ticks species through PCR/RT-PCR identification and/or by inoculation tick extract in mice (
 <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">Gargili et al., 2017</xref>). At least eight species of 
 <italic>Hyalomma</italic> such as 
 <italic>H. marginatum, H. dromedarii, H. rufipes, H. anatolicum, H. asiaticum, H. truncatum, H. turanicum</italic> and 
 <italic>H. impeltatum</italic> were recognized as potential vector competence for acquiring, maintenance and transmission of 
 <italic>CCHFV</italic> (

 <xref rid="bib150" ref-type="bibr">Mourya et al., 2012</xref>;

 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Deka, 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib212" ref-type="bibr">Spengler and Estrada-Peña, 2018</xref>). The CCHF is an acute, often fatal hemorrhagic fever (VHF) and the reported case fatality rate is 3 % to &gt;30% (
 <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Ergonul, 2006</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib233" ref-type="bibr">Yadav et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Al-Abri et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">Gargili et al., 2017</xref>). The disease is endemic in Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East and few sporadic outbreaks were also recorded in Kosovo, Albania, Iran, and Turkey. Recently, the westward expansion of the virus in Europe has been observed through detection of 
 <italic>CCHFV</italic> in ticks and autochthonous human cases in Spain (
 <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Estrada-Peña et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib158" ref-type="bibr">Negredo et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib163" ref-type="bibr">Oteo and Palomar, 2018</xref>). During the last one decade, most of the outbreaks were reported from Pakistan, Iran, Sudan, India and Bulgaria (
 <xref rid="bib225" ref-type="bibr">Whitehouse, 2004</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Aradaib et al., 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib170" ref-type="bibr">Patel et al., 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib145" ref-type="bibr">Messina et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Akuffo et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Al-Abri et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Dowall et al., 2017</xref>). Apart from 
 <italic>CCHFV</italic>, other zoonotic important viruses and bacteria were also recorded sporadically in 
 <italic>Hyalomma</italic> ticks in limited geographical areas (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). But, further studies are to be done to define the vector competence and relationship between the geographic distributions of these ticks and pathogens. In Saudi Arabia, 
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Al-Khalifa et al. (2007)</xref> reported various zoonotic viruses from different 
 <italic>Hyalomma</italic> species like Sindbis in 
 <italic>H. dromedarii</italic> and 
 <italic>H. impeltatum</italic>; Chick Ross in 
 <italic>H. dromedarii</italic>; Kadam in 
 <italic>H. dromedarii</italic> and 
 <italic>H. anatolicum</italic> and Dhori in 
 <italic>H. impeltatum</italic> and 
 <italic>H. schulzei</italic> but transmission potential of these species has not been confirmed. Bhanja virus, a member of family 
 <italic>Phenuiviridae</italic> (Order: 
 <italic>Bunyavirales</italic>) is transmitted to vertebrates through biting arthropods including ticks (
 <xref rid="bib142" ref-type="bibr">Matsuno et al., 2013</xref>). It was first isolated from 
 <italic>Hemaphysalis intermedia</italic> and later from different species of 
 <italic>Hyalomma</italic> (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) responsible for causing sporadic cases of febrile illness and encephalitis in humans (
 <xref rid="bib221" ref-type="bibr">Vesenjak-Hirjan et al., 1980</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib96" ref-type="bibr">Hubalek, 2009</xref>). Seroprevalence of Kadam virus in human and recognition of virus in 
 <italic>H. dromedarii</italic> may be correlated but with a precaution that both the events are reported at two different geographical locations (
 <xref rid="bib231" ref-type="bibr">Wood et al., 1982</xref>). Further, the Thogoto and Dhori viruses (family: 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae)</italic> cause severe illness and even death in humans. Primarily, it is a 'tick-borne virus' but aerosol transmission could also possible in humans (
 <xref rid="bib173" ref-type="bibr">Peng et al., 2017</xref>). Dhori viruses may cause a disease similar to avian influenza (H5N1) in humans (
 <xref rid="bib129" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2008</xref>). The West Nile virus is mainly transmitted through mosquitoes and cause mild to severe disease with the involvement of brain (encephalitis) but the virus was also isolated from tick, 
 <italic>H. marginatum</italic> collected from animals and birds (
 <xref rid="bib123" ref-type="bibr">L'Vov et al., 2002</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib161" ref-type="bibr">Oehme et al., 2017</xref>) and vector capacity of 
 <italic>H. marginatum</italic> was established experimentally (
 <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">Formosinho and Santos-Silva, 2006</xref>). Similarly, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (family: 
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic>) is responsible for causing serious disease in horses and humans. The mosquitoes are the principal vector but experimental transmission of the virus through 
 <italic>H. truncatum</italic> was also reported (
 <xref rid="bib132" ref-type="bibr">Linthicumlt and Logan, 1994</xref>).
