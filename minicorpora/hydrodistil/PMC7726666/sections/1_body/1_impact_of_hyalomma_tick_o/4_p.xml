<p id="p0035">Tick-borne rickettsioses are recognized as emerging/reemerging zoonotic infections worldwide. 
 <italic>Rickettsia aeschlimannii</italic> was first isolated from 
 <italic>H. marginatum</italic> and characterized as spotted fever group rickettsia (
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Beati et al., 1997</xref>), later, it was detected in many other 
 <italic>Hyalomma</italic> species. Other rickettsias of spotted fever group such as 
 <italic>R. sibirica, R. conorii, R. rickettsii</italic> and 
 <italic>R. africae</italic> were also isolated from various species of 
 <italic>Hyalomma</italic> but the vector capacity of these species has not been confirmed (
 <xref rid="bib159" ref-type="bibr">Nicholson et al., 2009</xref>). Similarly, 
 <italic>Coxiella burnetii, Anaplasma phagocytophilum</italic> and 
 <italic>Ehrlichia</italic> organisms were detected in 
 <italic>Hyalomma</italic> but its vector competency has not yet been established. A spirochetes bacteria, 
 <italic>Borrelia turcica</italic>, a reptile-associated borreliae, has been identified in 
 <italic>H. aegyptium</italic> and tortoise which may be zoonotic though its pathogenicity is unknown (
 <xref rid="bib106" ref-type="bibr">Kalmar et al., 2015</xref>).
