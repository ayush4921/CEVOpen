<p id="p0095">Earlier, 
 <xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr">Gill et al. (1986)</xref> reported the involvement of salivary proteins of 
 <italic>H. anatolicum</italic> in hypersensitivity reaction as an indicator of resistance against homologous challenge in rabbits. Subsequently, several workers reported comparatively higher adaptive immunity in laboratory animals than in natural hosts (
 <xref rid="bib180" ref-type="bibr">Ribeiro, 1989</xref>). 
 <xref rid="bib148" ref-type="bibr">Momin et al. (1991)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="bib209" ref-type="bibr">Singh et al. (1991)</xref> reported significantly adverse effect on ticks fed on animals repeatedly infested with 
 <italic>H. anatolicum</italic> and reconfirmed the earlier observations of 
 <xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr">Gill et al. (1986)</xref>. 
 <xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">Ghosh et al. (1998)</xref> immunized rabbits with extracts of larvae and nymphs and a significant reduction in the engorgement percentage, engorgement weight and egg masses in ticks fed on immunized animals compared to ticks fed on a control group of animals was recorded. A significant reduction of nymphs (91.3%) and adults (79.7%) fed on calves immunized with 39 kDa larval antigen (
 <xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">Ghosh et al., 1999</xref>) while, 84.2%, 61.4% and 58.7% rejection of larvae, nymphs and adults, respectively, in ticks fed on animals immunized with 39 kDa nymphal antigen (
 <xref rid="bib200" ref-type="bibr">Sharma et al., 2001</xref>) was reported. Further, the protective efficacy of cocktails of three polypeptides of 100, 59.4 and 37 kDa isolated from larvae of 
 <italic>H. anatolicum</italic> was assessed in calves and significant protection of 70.6 %, 54.5 % and 61.9 % against the homologous challenge of larvae, nymphs and adults, respectively, was recorded (
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Das et al., 2000</xref>). Subsequently, 
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Das et al. (2003)</xref> used a mixture of 106.8 and 68 kDa antigens isolated from midgut extract of 
 <italic>H. anatolicum</italic> and reported 74.4 % and 52.2 % decrease of nymphs and adults, respectively, after challenge infestations on cattle. In the same year, 
 <xref rid="bib205" ref-type="bibr">Singh and Ghosh (2003)</xref> isolated 34 and 29 kDa glycoprotein from unfed larvae of 
 <italic>H. anatolicum</italic> and 
 <italic>R. microplus</italic>, respectively, and reported the direct effect of immunization (DT %) of 69 % and 52 % against larvae and adults of 
 <italic>H. anatolicum</italic> and 60 % against 
 <italic>R. microplus</italic> adults. 
 <xref rid="bib88" ref-type="bibr">Hakim et al. (2011)</xref> evaluated three major glycoproteins (97, 66 and 40 kDa) purified from 
 <italic>H. dromedarii</italic> adults and larvae and demonstrated 63–67 % reduction in egg hatchability of ticks fed on immunized animals in comparison to ticks fed on control animals.
