 <italic>T. annulata</italic> infection in ticks fed on immunized calves compared to control groups. The results were substantiated through staining of salivary glands of challenged ticks, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of 
 <italic>T. annulata</italic> specific 721 bp gene segment (30 kDa major merozoite surface antigen gene) and
