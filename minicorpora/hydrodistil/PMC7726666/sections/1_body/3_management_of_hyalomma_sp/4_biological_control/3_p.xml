 <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">El-Sadawy and Habeeb (1998)</xref> studied the effect of five strains of entomopathogenic nematode (EPNs); 
 <italic>Steinernema</italic> spp. on 
 <italic>H. dromedarii</italic> engorged nymphs and reported strain S1 has a lethal effect after 7-day post infestation. Similarly, the lethal effect of IS-5 strain of 
 <italic>Heterorhabditis indicus</italic> was reported on both engorged nymphs and unfed adults of 
 <italic>H. excavatum</italic> at a concentration of 250 nematodes/cm

 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">El-Sadawy et al. (2008)</xref> studied two families of EPNs; Heterorhabditidae and Steinernematidae against 
 <italic>H. dromedarii</italic> and higher efficacy of 
 <italic>Heterorhabditid</italic> strains (12–92%) than 
 <italic>Steinernematid</italic> strains (4–88 %) were recorded. Although promising results were reported in 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions, the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy data is almost non-existing. There is a need to have research collaboration between laboratories involved in the exploration of biocontrol agent and tick experts to establish the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> efficacy of the biocontrol agent as a part of the integrated tick management (ITM).
