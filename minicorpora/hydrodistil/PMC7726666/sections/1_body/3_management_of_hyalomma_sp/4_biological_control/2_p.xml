<p id="p0070">Naturally, ticks have relatively few enemies, but the use of predators, parasites and pathogens viz., bacteria, fungi, spiders, ants, beetles, rodents, birds and other living organisms have been documented to limit tick populations. Amongst the 96 commercially active ingredients listed against pests based on microorganisms, 33 and 36 active ingredients are bacteria and fungi, respectively, and eight are entomopathogenic nematodes (
 <xref rid="bib194" ref-type="bibr">Samish et al., 2004</xref>). The pathogenic effect of active ingredients of bacteria against ticks has been reported. For example, 
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Brown et al. (1970)</xref> observed the pathogenic effect of 
 <italic>Proteus mirabilis</italic>, a gram-negative bacterium on 
 <italic>Dermacentor andersoni</italic>. Further, 
 <xref rid="bib93" ref-type="bibr">Hendry &amp; Rechav (1981)</xref> reported a detrimental effect of 
 <italic>R. decoloratus</italic> extracts containing bacteria (
 <italic>Proteus</italic> spp., 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas</italic> spp., 
 <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> spp.) on 
 <italic>H. marginatum</italic> and on other ticks. 
 <xref rid="bib91" ref-type="bibr">Hassanain et al. (1997)</xref> studied the efficacy of spraying three commercial varieties of 
 <italic>Bacillus thuringiensis</italic> (
 <italic>B. thuringiensis kurstaki, B. thuringiensis israelensis</italic> and 
 <italic>B. thuringiensis thuringiensis</italic>) against adults of 
 <italic>H. dromedarii.</italic> Among the three varieties, the LC50 of 
 <italic>B. thuringiensis kurstaki</italic> (1200–2344 mg/ml) was most pathogenic against 
 <italic>H. dromedarii</italic>. The eggs of both the tick species were highly susceptible to the bacterial infection. Researchers so far reported 20 natural fungal species, of which, the efficacy of 
 <italic>Beauveria</italic> and 
 <italic>Metarhizium</italic> species against ticks is well documented (
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Abdigoudarzi et al., 2009</xref>). Under the laboratory conditions, it was reported that 
 <italic>R. microplus</italic> and 
 <italic>H. excavatum</italic> larvae are more susceptible to 12 fungal strains than 
 <italic>R. sanguineus</italic> larvae. However, engorged 
 <italic>R. microplus</italic> and 
 <italic>R. sanguineus</italic> females were more susceptible to entomopathogenic fungi in comparison to 
 <italic>H. excavatum</italic> females (
 <xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr">Gindin et al., 2003</xref>). Further, 100% susceptibility of eggs to fungi were also reported (
 <xref rid="bib81" ref-type="bibr">Gorshkova, 1966</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib149" ref-type="bibr">Monteiro et al., 1998</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib105" ref-type="bibr">Kaaya, 2000</xref>). 
 <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Elham et al. (2013)</xref> studied the effect of 
 <italic>Scopulariopsis brevicaulis</italic> fungal spore suspension and culture filtrate on larvae, nymphs and adults of 
 <italic>H. anatolicum</italic> and high mortality of larvae and reduced biotic potential of the adults was reported. 
 <xref rid="bib213" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al. (2011)</xref> collected 13 species of entomopathogenic fungi from different areas in China and reported &lt;90% efficacy of 
 <italic>B. bassiana</italic> (B.bAT01, B.bAT17) and 
 <italic>M. anisopliae</italic> strains against 
 <italic>H. anatolicum.</italic>
