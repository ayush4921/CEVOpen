<p>The potential impacts of CEO on carcass traits were studied by a number of investigators and the results consisted of beneficial effects or no effect of the essential oil. The effects of CEO on abdominal fat and fatty acid compositions of liver in broilers were studied by Dalkilic et al. [
 <xref rid="B50-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] who indicated that saturated fatty acid (SFA) levels of broiler feeding on diets containing cinnamon oil at levels of 500 or 1000 ppm were lower, but polyunsaturated fatty acid, omega3 and fatty acid levels of the liver lipids were higher compared with the control (feeding basal diet) and antibiotic (avilamycin) groups. In contrast, Hernandez et al. [
 <xref rid="B49-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] suggested that broilers feeding on diets treated with 200 ppm EOE had no differences for gizzard, proventriculus, pancreas, liver and intestine weights at 14 and 21 days of age. Moreover, Tonbak and Çiftçi [
 <xref rid="B38-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] illustrated that supplementation of cinnamon oil (
 <italic>Cinnamomum zeylanicum</italic> L.) to the quail diets at concentrations of 250 and 500 mg/kg had no significant effects on carcass characteristics of quail. On the other hand, Symeon et al. [
 <xref rid="B39-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] added cinnamon oil to broiler diets at 0.5 or 1.0 mL per kg and summarized that cinnamon oil supplementation did not significantly affect the carcass traits and the internal organs weights, although cold carcass weight was the highest in the cinnamon oil-supplemented group (0.5 mL/kg). As Devi et al. [
 <xref rid="B34-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] suggested, no significant differences in broiler carcass traits were recorded as affected by the addition of cinnamon and ajwain essential oils at levels of 3 and 4 g/kg of feed, respectively. In addition, Gomathi et al. [
 <xref rid="B51-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] reported that carcass characteristics such as ready-to-cook yield, abdominal fat, eviscerated, liver, gizzard, heart and giblet weights as a percentage of live body weight were not changed by the supplementation of cinnamon oil at levels of 250 or 500 mg/kg and coated sodium butyrate at 0.09% or 0.18% in broiler diets. In addition, the special aroma of cinnamon is desirable in poultry diets, and causes the elevation of the carcass content of unsaturated fatty acids and the alleviation of its content of SFA.
