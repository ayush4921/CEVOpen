<p>Many studies were carried out to investigate the identification and quantification of the essential chemical components of volatile oils in the bark and leaf of wild and true cinnamon species. The concentration of some of the constituents identified in the cinnamon oil (leaf and bark) is presented in 
 <xref rid="antibiotics-09-00210-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The studies revealed that the chemical compositions of essential oil and oil yield were different as a result of many factors such as species, the part of the plant (leaf, bark, fruit and root) and the extraction method.
