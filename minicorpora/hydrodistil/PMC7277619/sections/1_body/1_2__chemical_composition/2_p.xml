<p>Abdelwahab et al. [
 <xref rid="B21-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] indicated that the important components of 
 <italic>Cinnamomum altissimum</italic> Kosterm bark oil were linalool (36.0%), terpinen-4-ol (6.4%), limonene (8.3%), methyl eugenol (12.8%) and α-terpineol (7.8%). The total phenolic components consisted of 50.41 μg GAE/mg of the oil. The antioxidant activity of the extract was 345.2 μM Fe
 <sup>+2</sup>/g dry mass using FRAP (ferric reducing antioxidant power) assay and with an IC50 value of 38.5 μg/mL using DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) assay. Liyanage et al. [
 <xref rid="B22-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] revealed that the highest percentage of volatile component (3.23%) was found in 
 <italic>Cinnamomum verum</italic> leaf oil. 
 <italic>Cinnamomum sinharajense</italic> recorded the highest bark oil content (3.53%), while 
 <italic>Cinnamomum rivulorum</italic> recorded the lowest stem bark oil (0.51%) and leaf oil (0.41%) contents. The essential oils of different cinnamon species contained fifteen very important volatile chemical constituents. 
 <italic>Cinnamomum verum</italic> contained the highest percentage of cinnamaldehyde (67.57%) in comparison with the other wild cinnamon species. 
 <italic>Cinnamomum sinharajense</italic> leaf recorded the highest content of euginol (87.53%). As Paranagama et al. [
 <xref rid="B23-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] analyzed, the EO of the leaf, bark, fruit and root of cinnamon showed that the largest constituents of cinnamon fruit oil (CFO) were 8-caryophyllene (5.6%), T-cadinol (7.7%), and 6- and y-cadinene (36.0%). Approximately 84% of CFO is contained in sesquiterpenes, as the other parts of cinnamon comprise less than 9% of this group of components. Additionally, the main components of cinnamon leaf and bark oils were phenyl propanoids, but monoterpenes were the largest component (95%) of the root oil. Conversely, Kasim et al. [
 <xref rid="B24-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] detected that the methodology of the extraction and the chemical components used were impacted by the cinnamon oil yield percentage. The highest oil yields were extracted by soxhlet extraction with dichloromethane (5.22%), hexane (3.84%) and petroleum ether (3.71%), respectively. However, using hydrodistillation methods recorded the lowest CEO yield extraction (only 1.82%). The results showed that nine major volatile compounds were obtained in the CEO extracted by hydrodistillation such as alcohols, ether, ester, aldehydes, ketone, alkenes and carboxylic acids. The highest percentage of trans-cinnamaldehyde 86.67%, which is considered to be the largest volatile component, was obtained by soxhlet extraction using hexane. Moreover, Atiphasaworn et al. [
 <xref rid="B25-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] identified the volatile components of the EO of 
 <italic>Cinnamomum bejolghota</italic> bark using GC-MS. Thirty six volatile components were identified with the largest constituents being borneol, γ-terpineol, terpinen-4-ol and 1,8-cineole. The EO of 
 <italic>Cinnamomum bejolghota</italic> bark were firstly examined for their antifungal and antibacterial activities against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 
 <italic>Cinnamomum bejolghota</italic> bark oil against bacteria ranged from 31.25 to 62.50 μg/mL, and the inhibition against fungal pathogens (MIC = 125–500 μg/mL) was moderate. The powerful antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic>Cinnamomum bejolghota</italic> bark oil was associated mainly with linalool, γ-terpineol, terpinen-4-ol, 1,8-cineole and borneol. Adinew [
 <xref rid="B26-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] identified six components from the EO of cinnamon bark rising in Tepi (Southwest, Ethiopia). In addition, Şimşek et al. [
 <xref rid="B27-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] analyzed the hydrodistillation of essential oil from the bark of 
 <italic>Cinnamomum zeylanicum</italic> Lauraceae using Gas chromatography (GC) and Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) systems. Twelve components comprising 99.2% of the cinnamon oil were identified. The largest components in this oil were cinnamaldehyde (88.2%), eugenol (1.0%) and benzyl alcohol (8.0%). Moreover, El-Baroty et al. [
 <xref rid="B28-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] showed that essential oil extracted from the bark of 
 <italic>Cinnamomum zeylanicum</italic> was characterized as being a unique, aromatic, monoterpene-rich natural source, with trans-cinnamaldehyde (45.62%) as the major constituent. The largest components were 3-phenyl, 2-propenal (87.013%), which comprised most of the components responsible for the therapeutic effect and cinnamon barks’ aroma.
