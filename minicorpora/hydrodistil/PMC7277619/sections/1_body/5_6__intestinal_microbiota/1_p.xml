<p>New strategies must be developed to boost poultry health [
 <xref rid="B58-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The balance of intestinal microbiota (harmful and beneficial bacteria) is essential to get a healthy gut [
 <xref rid="B59-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The potential effectiveness of CEO as a antimicrobial agent was studied by many researchers [
 <xref rid="B47-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,
 <xref rid="B53-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Most of the studies corroborated that CEO has a high level of antimicrobial activity and can be used as food biopreservative. Yang et al. [
 <xref rid="B53-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] indicated that broiler diets supplemented with CEO (100 mg/kg feed) significantly decreased cecal 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> relative multiplicity and significantly increased cecal 
 <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> and 
 <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> relative multiplicity and concluded that CEO can be used as a potent alternative to antibiotics (aureomycin) as a way of improving the broilers’ cecal microbiota. Similar actions for CEO on quails were repeated by Mehdipour and Afsharmanesh [
 <xref rid="B47-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], who showed that the ileal coliforms count was decreased and the ileal 
 <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> count was increased in quails fed cinnamon oil (200 ppm/kg diet) compared with the control, antibiotic (virginiamycin) and cinnamon powder groups. In vitro, Gupta et al. [
 <xref rid="B60-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] find that the inhibitory effect of CEO against bacteria and fungi was very alleviating and the lowest MIC was 1.25% (
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) against 
 <italic>Klebsiella sp.</italic>, 
 <italic>E.coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> and 
 <italic>Bacillus sp.</italic> and 
 <italic>Rhizomucor sp.</italic> among the fungi. The antimicrobial potent agent for cinnamon oil was higher than cinnamon extract potency. In addition, it was concluded that the minimal bactericide concentration (MBC) and MIC for CEO were between 125–250 and 25–100 µg/mL, respectively. In contrast, it made no significant difference in ileal and cecal total bacterial counts, 
 <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> and 
 <italic>E.coli</italic> as a result of supplementation of a combination of calcium formate and cinnamaldehyde (500 mg/kg feed) to the broiler diets, however a significant decrease in 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> counts was obtained [
 <xref rid="B48-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Cinnamon essential oil is mainly comprised of volatile components; the largest and most important contents are cinnamaldehyde followed by eugenol and carvacrol. These phenolic compounds manifest considerable antifungal and antimicrobial activity [
 <xref rid="B61-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. In addition, such volatile components as carvacrol manipulate the pH equilibrium of inorganic ions via their disruption of membrane integrity [
 <xref rid="B62-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. The antibacterial activity of cinnamaldehyde, eugenol and carvacrol was observed due to their preventive effects on pathogen microorganisms [
 <xref rid="B49-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. On the other hand, plant extracts and herbs disrupt the growth of numerous pathogenic bacteria and encourage the growth of beneficial bacteria in the digestive tracts of poultry [
 <xref rid="B63-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Moreover, several in vitro studies demonstrated that herbal essential oils, such as cinnamaldehyde, thymol and carvacrol, exhibited strong antimicrobial effects against pathogenic bacteria including 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> [
 <xref rid="B64-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,
 <xref rid="B65-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Chowdhury et al. [
 <xref rid="B66-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] found that a supplemental 300 mg/kg of cinnamon bark oil (containing 505–977 g of cinnamaldehyde/kg) reduced the numbers of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> in the pre-cecal contents of broiler chickens. Certain research studies also indicated that the use of thymol with cinnamaldehyde would have the potential to prevent the proliferation of pathogens and contribute to better animal gut health [
 <xref rid="B67-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,
 <xref rid="B68-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Jamroz et al. [
 <xref rid="B69-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] stated that the mixture of cinnamaldehyde, capsaicin and carvacrol decreased the count of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, and improved the count of 
 <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> in the intestinal tract of broilers. The positive effect of cinnamon oil on the population of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> might be due to the ability of this oil to disrupt the cell membranes of bacteria [
 <xref rid="B68-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. In addition, it has been reported that essential oil improves the release of mucus into the gut, which lowers the adhesion of pathogenic bacteria to the epithelium [
 <xref rid="B70-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. An in vitro study on ceacal content by Kollanoor-Johny et al. [
 <xref rid="B71-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] found that the use of 20 mM of cinnamaldehyde, eugenol, thymol or carvacrol was sufficient in significantly reducing the concentrations of 
 <italic>Campylobacter</italic> after 15 s of incubation. By 8 h of incubation, the use of 10 mM concentrations of these constituents was effective in reducing the count of 
 <italic>C. jejuni</italic> by at least 5-log CFUs/mL [
 <xref rid="B71-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Finally, the use of CEO as feed additives in poultry diets had some beneficial effects on the growth performance and lipid profile, antioxidant status, immunity and antibacterial activity of poultry as shown in
