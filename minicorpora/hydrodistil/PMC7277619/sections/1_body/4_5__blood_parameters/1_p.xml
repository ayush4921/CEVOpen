<p>Most studies which investigated the effects of CEO on blood biochemical parameters illustrated the valuable impacts of CEO on these parameters, particularly its effects on lipid profile, antioxidant activity and immunity. Al-Kassie [
 <xref rid="B29-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and Ciftci et al. [
 <xref rid="B52-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] reported that serum levels of catalase enzyme activities, glutathione peroxidase, ω-6 fatty acids, total unsaturated fatty acid ratio and blood phagocytic activity were increased significantly in broilers’ feeding diets that contained CEO. While serum malondialdehyde (MDA) level, cholesterol levels, total saturated fatty acid ratio and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity were decreased significantly in CEO groups compared to the control and antibiotic groups. Similar findings were reported by Yang et al. [
 <xref rid="B53-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], who revealed that broilers feeding on diets mixed with different levels of CEO—alone (50, 100, 200, 400, or 800 mg of CEO/kg), or combined with bamboo leaf flavonoid (BLF) (100 mg CEO and 16.7 mg BLF/kg or 200 mg CEO/kg and 33.3 mg BLF/kg)—had significant impacts on liver MDA contents at 21 days old and serum IgM contents at 42 days old. Moreover, Torki et al. [
 <xref rid="B45-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] concluded that the supplementation combination of CEO and Zn to the diets of laying hens reared under cold stress conditions significantly reduced the serum levels of triglycerides and glucose and increased the plasma content of Zn compared with those fed the control diet. Additionally, Sarica et al. [
 <xref rid="B30-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] theorized that quail diets combined with the supplementation of OEO plus CEO or mannanoligosaccharide resulted in a reduction of plasma, total cholesterol and triglycerides levels compared with the basal diet. Moreover, Abudabos et al. [
 <xref rid="B54-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] showed that plasma thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, total protein, and globulin were significantly increased in broiler chicks growing on 
 <italic>Clostridium perfringens</italic> contaminated diets and supplemented with a mixture of cinnamaldehyde, anise, carvacol, thyme, yucca extract and oregano essential oils. Conversely, a study by Lee et al. [
 <xref rid="B35-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] indicated that there was no change in plasma lipid concentrations caused by cinnamaldehyde supplementation in the feed. The reduction of cholesterol in the groups fed EO components may be due to its suppressing impact on 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase [
 <xref rid="B55-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], which is a key enzyme in the synthesis of cholesterol [
 <xref rid="B56-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. On the other hand, active principles of spices such as eugenol, linalool and cuminaldehyde were shown to inhibit lipid peroxidation [
 <xref rid="B57-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. To summarize, the possible mechanism of EO in limiting and preventing cell membrane destruction by oxidative and production of free radicals, consequently reduces MDA formation.
