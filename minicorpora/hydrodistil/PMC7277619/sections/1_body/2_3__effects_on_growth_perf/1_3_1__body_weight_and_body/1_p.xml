<p>Many trials were carried out to assess the impacts of dietary supplementation with cinnamon (powder and oil) and CEO components as growth promoter agents. Al-Kassie [
 <xref rid="B29-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] showed that broilers feeding on diet additives with CEO had a body weight gain significantly higher than the control (without CEO). In addition, Sarica et al. [
 <xref rid="B30-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] illustrated that supplementation of CEO in quail diets had the same effects of antibiotic, probiotic, enzymes, mannanoligosaccharide, oregano essential oil (OEO), OEO plus CEO on body weight gain (BWG) of quail during the growth period of 0–35 days. Toghyani et al. [
 <xref rid="B31-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] displayed that the addition of cinnamon to broiler diets by about 2 g/kg significantly improved the final body weight of the chicks. On the other hand, Mehdipour et al. [
 <xref rid="B32-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] indicated that dietary supplementation with cinnamon oil (200 mg/kg) significantly increased the BWG of quails at 21–35 days old as a comparison with cinnamon powder, antibiotic (virginiamycin) and symbiotic. Shirzadegan [
 <xref rid="B33-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] observed a significant increase in the final body weight of broiler chickens feeding on diets supplemented with different concentrations of cinnamon powder (especially at a level of 0.5%). Moreover, Devi et al. [
 <xref rid="B34-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] showed that supplementation with a combination of CEO and ajwain essential oil in broiler diets significantly increased body weight at age 42 days. However, Lee et al. [
 <xref rid="B35-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] stated that cinnamaldehyde supplementation in feed had no significant effect on female broilers’ weight gain, but water intake was decreased significantly. Muhl and Liebert [
 <xref rid="B36-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] reported that the performance of broiler chicks was not significantly affected as a result of using commercial phytogenic feed additives that contain carvacol, capsicum oleoresin, cinnamaldehyde, chelerythrin and alkaloids sanguinarin. Koochaksaraie et al. [
 <xref rid="B37-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] showed that the inclusion of cinnamon (0.5 to 2 g/kg diet) had no influence on the growth in broiler chickens. Moreover, Tonbak and Çiftçi [
 <xref rid="B38-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] concluded that supplementation of cinnamon oil (
 <italic>Cinnamomum zeylanicum</italic> L.) in the diets at concentrations of 250 and 500 mg/kg diet had no significant influence on the live weight and live weight gain of the quail. Symeon et al. [
 <xref rid="B39-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] added cinnamon oil to broiler diets at 0.5 or 1.0 mL per kg and summarized that cinnamon oil supplementation did not significantly affect broiler body weight at marketing age. In alternative strategies, emphasis was placed on preventing the spread of pathogenic bacteria and modifying the bacterial ecosystem of the intestine to improve the overall health and immune status, thereby improving productive performance. The enhancing effect of EO on the feed efficiency and growth performance was due to improving the immune system, regulating the gut micro flora, increasing endogenous digestive enzymes secretion and eliciting antioxidant, antibacterial and anti-viral properties [
