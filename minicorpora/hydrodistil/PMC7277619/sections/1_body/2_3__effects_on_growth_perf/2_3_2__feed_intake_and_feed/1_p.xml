<p>Studies related to the impact of cinnamon oil on feed intake (FI) and feed conversion rate (FCR) were contradictory, while many researchers [

 <xref rid="B44-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,
 <xref rid="B45-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] concluded that cinnamon oil has beneficial effects on FI and FCR. Al-Kassie [
 <xref rid="B29-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] clarified that the chicks fed on diets containing 200 ppm EO resulting from a combination of thyme and cinnamon achieved significant increases in feed efficiency and FI compared to the control. Similarly, Ciftci et al. [
 <xref rid="B46-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] suggested that broilers receiving a diet supplemented with 500 ppm cinnamon oil showed the best feed conversion efficiency in comparison with avilamycin (antibiotic) groups and the control. In addition, Mehdipour et al. [
 <xref rid="B32-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] found that quails’ diet supplemented with cinnamon oil (200 mg/kg) significantly improved FCR compared to the control group (0–35 days), while FI was not affected. Moreover, Şimşek et al. [
 <xref rid="B44-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] reported that the addition of cinnamon oil to the diets significantly reduced FCR. Torki et al. [
 <xref rid="B45-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] indicated that FCR was significantly lessened in laying hens housed under cold stress conditions (8.8 ± 3 °C) and fed on the diets including Zn and CEO (combined or single) compared with those fed on the control diet. In addition, Mehdipour and Afsharmanesh [
 <xref rid="B47-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] showed that the supplementation of cinnamon oil or virginiamycin to quail diets at a level of 200 mg/kg had the same significant beneficial effects on FCR compared to the control group at day 35; however, feed intake did not differ among the groups. In another study, Pathak et al. [
 <xref rid="B48-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] demonstrated that enramycin supplementation (125 mg/kg feed), or a combination of calcium formate and cinnamaldehyde (500 mg/kg diet), to broilers orally challenged with 
 <italic>E.coli</italic> (10
 <sup>8</sup> bacteria/bird) on day 14, significantly improved FCR compared with the control group, and concluded that antibiotics can be replaced with EO and organic acid. Contradictory studies were reported by Symeon et al. [
 <xref rid="B39-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], Sarica et al. [
 <xref rid="B30-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and Lee et al. [
 <xref rid="B35-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] showing that cinnamon oil or powder did not significantly affect the FI or FCR of birds. Lee et al. [
 <xref rid="B35-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] pointed out that cinnamaldehyde supplementation in feed had no significant influences on the FI and FCR of female broilers, however, water intake was significantly decreased. In addition, Hernandez et al. [
 <xref rid="B49-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] indicated that broilers feeding on diets treated with 200 ppm essential oil extract (EOE) from cinnamon, pepper and oregano had no significant alterations in FI or FCR at 14 and 21 days of age. Moreover, Tonbak and Çiftçi [
 <xref rid="B38-antibiotics-09-00210" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] reported that supplementation of cinnamon oil (
 <italic>Cinnamomum zeylanicum</italic> L.) to the diets at concentrations of 250 and 500 mg/kg had no significant impacts on FCR of quail.
