1: (syn.
2: Fagara leprieurii Engl and  Fagara Angolensis) is a plant species belonging to the Genus  Zanthoxylum of the Rutaceae family, which contains approximatively 150 Genus and 900 species.
3: Z. leprieurii is distributed in rain forests and wooded savannahs in Africa, from Senegal (Western Africa), Ethiopia (Eastern Africa), to Angola, Zimbabwe and Mozambique (Southern Africa) [ 1].
4: Known as a multipurpose species,  Z. leprieurii has a wide spectrum of applications, as leaves, trunk bark and roots are used in traditional medicine to cure rheumatism and for the treatment of tuberculosis and generalized body pains in Central and Western Africa [ 2, 3, 4].
5: Roots are used as chewing sticks to clean the mouth [ 5].
6: Moreover, this plant is also used for canoes, boxes, plywood, general carpentry, domestic utensils, beehives and water pots; the pale yellow wood is tough, medium coarse-grained and light [ 6].
7: Dried fruits of  Z. leprieurii are used as spices by local populations in many regions of Africa [ 7].
8: The plant has shown antioxidant, antimicrobial, anticancer, cytotoxic, schistosomidal and antibacterial properties [ 8, 9, 10, 11, 12].
9: From a chemical point of view, a large variety of compounds from different chemical classes were reported in  Z. leprieurii solvent extracts: acridone alkaloids, benzophenanthridine [ 13], aliphatic amide [ 14], coumarins [ 15] and kaurane diterpenes [ 11].
10: Essential oils produced from  Z. leprieurii revealed that the main constituents in fruit essential oils were ( E)--ocimene (29.40%) and -citronellol (17.37%) [ 15, 16, 17].
11: Our previous study showed the predominance of tridecan-2-one (47.50%) in leaf essential oils from Cote dIvoire [ 18].
12: Limonene (94.90%) and terpinolene (50.00%) were described as major components in essential oils from Nigeria and Cameroon, respectively [ 19, 20].
13: The composition of trunk bark essential oils was predominated by sesquiterpenoids in Nigeria and methyl ketones in Cote dIvoire [ 18, 19].
