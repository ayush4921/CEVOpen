<p>The first aim of this study was to explore climate-related variations of the composition of essential oils hydrodistillated from different 
 <italic>Z. leprieurii</italic> organs (leaves, trunk bark and fruits). The variation over time of essential oil chemical compositions was then studied at one site in Côte d’Ivoire. GC/MS was used to identify essential oil chemical profiles and statistical analyses were performed on the different chemical compositions. In addition, this study also aimed to evaluate the impact of 
 <italic>Z. leprieurii</italic> essential oil composition variations on their in vitro biological activities, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, insecticidal and anti-plasmodial activities. To our knowledge, such studies have not yet been carried out on this species in Côte d′Ivoire.
