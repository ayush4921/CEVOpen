0: The first aim of this study was to explore climate-related variations of the composition of essential oils hydrodistillated from different  Z. leprieurii organs (leaves, trunk bark and fruits).
1: The variation over time of essential oil chemical compositions was then studied at one site in Cote dIvoire.
2: GC/MS was used to identify essential oil chemical profiles and statistical analyses were performed on the different chemical compositions.
3: In addition, this study also aimed to evaluate the impact of  Z. leprieurii essential oil composition variations on their in vitro biological activities, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, insecticidal and anti-plasmodial activities.
4: To our knowledge, such studies have not yet been carried out on this species in Cote dIvoire.
