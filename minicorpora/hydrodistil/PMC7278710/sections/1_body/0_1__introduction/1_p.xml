 <italic>Fagara Angolensis</italic>) is a plant species belonging to the Genus 
 <italic>Zanthoxylum</italic> of the Rutaceae family, which contains approximatively 150 Genus and 900 species.

 <italic>Z. leprieurii</italic> are used as spices by local populations in many regions of Africa [
 <xref rid="B7-foods-09-00550" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The plant has shown antioxidant, antimicrobial, anticancer, cytotoxic, schistosomidal and antibacterial properties [

 <xref rid="B12-foods-09-00550" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. From a chemical point of view, a large variety of compounds from different chemical classes were reported in 
 <italic>Z. leprieurii</italic> solvent extracts: acridone alkaloids, benzophenanthridine [
 <xref rid="B13-foods-09-00550" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], aliphatic amide [

 <xref rid="B15-foods-09-00550" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and kaurane diterpenes [
 <xref rid="B11-foods-09-00550" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Essential oils produced from 
 <italic>Z. leprieurii</italic> revealed that the main constituents in fruit essential oils were (
 <italic>E</italic>)-β-ocimene (29.40%) and β-citronellol (17.37%) [

 <xref rid="B17-foods-09-00550" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Our previous study showed the predominance of tridecan-2-one (47.50%) in leaf essential oils from Côte d’Ivoire [
 <xref rid="B18-foods-09-00550" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Limonene (94.90%) and terpinolene (50.00%) were described as major components in essential oils from Nigeria and Cameroon, respectively [
