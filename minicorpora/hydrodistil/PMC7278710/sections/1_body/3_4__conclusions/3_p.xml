<p>Grain storage is particularly problematic, as pests cause large losses. Ivoirian essential oils from 
 <italic>Z. leprieurii</italic> demonstrated an interesting repellent effect and contact toxicity properties against 
 <italic>Sitophilus granarius</italic> with the essential oils extracted from the three organs tested (trunk bark, leaves and fruits). All these essential oils are promising candidates for developing new plant insecticides to protect stored products. Moreover, according to De Lucas and colleagues [
 <xref rid="B83-foods-09-00550" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>], parts of the plant could also be used in silos directly without the extraction step of the essential oils to control pest losses. Indeed, this practice is widely used in Africa because plant material is readily available and usable without any transformation. Moreover, it is easy to separate the plant material added to the silo from the grain for use as food or feed. It would then be interesting to study the insecticidal properties of 
 <italic>Z. leprieurii</italic> organs in that way.
