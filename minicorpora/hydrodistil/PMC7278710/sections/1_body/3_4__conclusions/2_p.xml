 <italic>Z. leprieurii</italic> is widely used in traditional medicine for the treatment of different diseases, such as rheumatism, tuberculosis, urinary infections and generalized body pains. In order to explain those uses, in-vitro biological activities of hydrodistillated essential oils were studied here. Results obtained in this study showed strong antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and moderate anti-plasmodial activities. Moreover, expected results also showed high differences in the biological activities of essential oils linked with their differences in chemical composition, which should be taken into account in future research on 
 <italic>Z. leprieurii</italic> essential oil biological activities, but also to find the proper plant harvesting moment for a use in traditional medicine. However, while those results are promising and confirm the relevance of the traditional uses of these plants, in-vitro experiments should be supported by in-vivo tests, as differences can be observed between in-vitro and in-vivo test results.
