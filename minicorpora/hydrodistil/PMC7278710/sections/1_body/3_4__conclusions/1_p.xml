<p>In this study, the variability in the chemical composition of leaf, trunk bark and fruit essential oils hydrodistillated from Ivorian 
 <italic>Z. leprieurii</italic> was studied for the first time over seven months for leaves and trunk bark, and five months for fruits. Results showed that essential oils were mainly dominated by sesquiterpenes (β-caryophyllene, dendrolasin and thymol), methylketones (tridecan-2-one and undecane-2 one) and monoterpenes (β-myrcene, (
 <italic>E</italic>)-β-ocinene and perillene) in leaf, trunk bark and fruit samples, respectively. Statistical PCA and HCA analysis showed that the variability in essential oil compositions mainly comes from the organ, as all samples were clustered in three groups, each one corresponding to one organ. However, differences in essential oil compositions inside each cluster were highlighted, showing the probable impact of the seasonal effect on essential oil compositions. Those differences in essential oil compositions may be due to different seasonal parameters, as it was shown here that the temperature, precipitations and humidity were not constant during the plant collecting period. However, it is also known that biotic factors, such as pest attacks, widely impact essential oil chemical compositions. Those were not recorded during this study, but may also be at the origin of essential oil variability. As a perspective, it would be interesting to study their impact on 
 <italic>Z. leprieurii</italic> essential oil variability. Moreover, the study was conducted with plants growing on the same site. The comparison of the present results with those of the existing literature considering 
 <italic>Z. leprieurii</italic> plants growing in other countries showed totally different essential oil compositions, showing that genetic differences might also induce dissimilar essential oil compositions, resulting in distinct essential oil chemotypes.
