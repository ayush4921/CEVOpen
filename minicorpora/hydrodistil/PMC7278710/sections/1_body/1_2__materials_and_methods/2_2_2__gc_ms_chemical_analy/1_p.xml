<p>Essential oils hydrodistillated from 
 <italic>Z. leprieurii</italic> organs were analyzed by GC/MS. An Agilent GC system 7890B (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with a split/splitless injector and an Agilent MSD 5977B detector was used. The experience was repeated three times for each essential oil. One µL of essential oil dilutions (0.01% in hexane; 
 <italic>w/v</italic>) was injected in splitless mode at 300 °C on an HP-5MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm, d
 <italic>f</italic> = 0.25µm). The temperature was maintained one min at 50 °C, and then increased at a rate of 5 °C/min until 300 °C. The final temperature was maintained for 5 min. The sources and quadrupole temperatures were fixed at 230 °C and 150 °C, respectively. The scan range was 40–400 m/z, and the carrier gas was helium at a flow rate of 1.2 mL/min. The component identification was performed on the basis of chromatographic retention indices (RI) and by comparison of the recorded spectra with a computed data library (Pal 600K

 <xref rid="B27-foods-09-00550" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. RI values were measured on an HP-5MS column (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). RI calculations were performed in temperature program mode according to a mixture of homologues n-alkanes (C7–C30), which were analyzed under the same chromatographic conditions. The main components were confirmed by comparison of their retention and MS spectrum data with co-injected pure references (Sigma, Darmstadt, Germany) when commercially available.
