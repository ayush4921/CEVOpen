0: Essential oils hydrodistillated from  Z. leprieurii organs were analyzed by GC/MS.
1: An Agilent GC system 7890B (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with a split/splitless injector and an Agilent MSD 5977B detector was used.
2: The experience was repeated three times for each essential oil.
3: One L of essential oil dilutions (0.01% in hexane;  w/v) was injected in splitless mode at 300 C on an HP-5MS capillary column (30 m  0.25 mm, d f = 0.25m).
4: The temperature was maintained one min at 50 C, and then increased at a rate of 5 C/min until 300 C. The final temperature was maintained for 5 min.
5: The sources and quadrupole temperatures were fixed at 230 C and 150 C, respectively.
6: The scan range was 40400 m/z, and the carrier gas was helium at a flow rate of 1.2 mL/min.
7: The component identification was performed on the basis of chromatographic retention indices (RI) and by comparison of the recorded spectra with a computed data library (Pal 600K ) [ 25, 26, 27].
8: RI values were measured on an HP-5MS column (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA).
9: RI calculations were performed in temperature program mode according to a mixture of homologues n-alkanes (C7C30), which were analyzed under the same chromatographic conditions.
10: The main components were confirmed by comparison of their retention and MS spectrum data with co-injected pure references (Sigma, Darmstadt, Germany) when commercially available.
