0: Z. leprieurii organs were collected at Adzope (60625 N, 35136 W), in south-eastern Cote dIvoire, between May and November 2017 for leaves and trunk bark, respectively, and between July and November 2017 for fruits.
1: At each harvest, leaf, fruit and trunk bark samples were taken from 15 randomly selected trees, in the geographical area described before, by taking the same amount of plant material from each tree and pooling it before distillation.
2: The total amount of plant material was between 700 and 1500 g. The same tree was only sampled once to prevent the previous sampling from influencing the next one (e.g., trunk injury).
3: Plants were identified by the Centre Suisse of Research (Adiopodoume, Abidjan, Cote dIvoire) and by the National Flora Center (CNF; Abidjan, Cote dIvoire).
4: The vouchers of the specimen (UCJ016132) have been deposited at the CNF Herbarium.
5: Fresh organ material was hydrodistillated for 3 h using a Clevenger-type apparatus.
6: The pale yellow essential oils were treated with anhydrous sodium sulphate (Na 2SO 4) as a drying agent, stored in sealed amber vials, and conserved at 4 C before analysis.
7: The essential oil yields ( w/w) were calculated as the rapport between the mass of essential oils obtained compared to the mass of fresh organs.
