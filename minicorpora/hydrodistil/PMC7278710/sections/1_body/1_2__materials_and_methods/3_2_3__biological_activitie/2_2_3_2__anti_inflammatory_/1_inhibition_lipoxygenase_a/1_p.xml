<p>The anti-inflammatory activities of 
 <italic>Z. leprieurii</italic> essential oils were determined by the method previously described by Nikhila [
 <xref rid="B30-foods-09-00550" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In brief, the reaction mixture containing essential oils in various concentrations (100, 75, 50 and 25 µg/mL of methanol) (in triplicate for each concentration), lipoxygenase (Sigma, Darmstadt, Germany) and 35 µL (0.1 mg/mL) of a 0.2 M borate buffer solution (pH = 9.0) was incubated for 15 min at 25 °C. The reaction was then initiated by the addition of 35 µL of a substrate solution (linoleic acid 250 µM), and the absorbance was measured at 234 nm. Quercetin (Sigma, Darmstadt, Germany) was used as a standard inhibitor at the same concentration as the essential oils. The inhibition percentage of lipoxygenase activity was calculated as follows:
 <disp-formula>Inhibition percentage % = (Abs Blank-Abs sample)/(Abs blank) × 100
  <label>(2)</label>
 </disp-formula> where Abs blank is the Absorbance (Abs) of the reaction media without the essential oil, and Absorbance sample is the Abs of the reaction media with the essential oil minus the Abs value of the diluted essential oil (to compensate for absorbance due to the essential oils themselves).
