0: This test was conducted as described by Kar [ 31] with some slight modifications.
1: The reaction mixture consisted of 1 mL essential oil samples and diclofenac (standard) at 100, 75, 50 and 25 g/mL in methanol, 0.5 mL bovine serum albumin (BSA) at 2% in water and 2.5 mL phosphate-buffered saline adjusted with hydrochloric acid (HCl) to pH 6.3.
2: The tubes were incubated for 20 min at room temperature, then heated to 70 C for 5 min and subsequently cooled for 10 min [ 32].
3: The absorbance of these solutions was determined using a spectrophotometer at 660 nm.
4: The experiment was performed in triplicate.
5: The inhibition percentage of albumin denaturation was calculated on a percentage basis relative to the control using the formula: Inhibition percentage of denaturation % = (Abs Blank-Abs sample)/(Abs blank)  100  (3) where Abs blank corresponds to the Absorbance (Abs) of the reaction media without the addition of essential oil.
6: Absorbance sample is the Abs of the reaction media with addition of essential oil, subtracted by the Abs value of the diluted essential oil (to compensate for absorbance due to the essential oils themselves).
