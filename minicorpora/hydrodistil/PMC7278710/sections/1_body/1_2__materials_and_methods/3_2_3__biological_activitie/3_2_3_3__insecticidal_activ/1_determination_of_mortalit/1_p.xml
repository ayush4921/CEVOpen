<p>Essential oil dilutions (10, 14, 18, 22, 26 and 30 µL/mL) were prepared in acetone. Talisma UL (Biosix, Hermalle-sous-Huy, Belgium), a classical chemical insecticide used for the protection of stored grains against insects, was also used at the same concentrations. For each test, 500 µL of essential oil or standard solution were homogeneously dispersed in tubes containing 20 g of organic wheat grains. The solvent was allowed to evaporate from grains for 20 min before infesting them by 12 adult insects. The granary weevil, 
 <italic>Sitophilus granarius</italic>, was chosen for this study because it is one of the most damaging cereal pests in the world. Moreover, this insect is a primary pest, which means it is able to drill holes in grains, laying its eggs inside them and allowing secondary pests to develop in the grains [

The mortality was recorded after 24 h of incubation. Results from all replicates were subjected to Probit Analysis using Python 3.7 program to determine LC
