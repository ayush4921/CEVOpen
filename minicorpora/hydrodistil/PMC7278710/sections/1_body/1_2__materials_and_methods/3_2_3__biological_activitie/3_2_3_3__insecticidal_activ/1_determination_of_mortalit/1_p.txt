0: Essential oil dilutions (10, 14, 18, 22, 26 and 30 L/mL) were prepared in acetone.
1: Talisma UL (Biosix, Hermalle-sous-Huy, Belgium), a classical chemical insecticide used for the protection of stored grains against insects, was also used at the same concentrations.
2: For each test, 500 L of essential oil or standard solution were homogeneously dispersed in tubes containing 20 g of organic wheat grains.
3: The solvent was allowed to evaporate from grains for 20 min before infesting them by 12 adult insects.
4: The granary weevil,  Sitophilus granarius, was chosen for this study because it is one of the most damaging cereal pests in the world.
5: Moreover, this insect is a primary pest, which means it is able to drill holes in grains, laying its eggs inside them and allowing secondary pests to develop in the grains [ 33, 34].
6: Acetone was used as a negative control.
7: Six replicates were created for all treatments and controls, and they were incubated at 30 C. The mortality was recorded after 24 h of incubation.
8: Results from all replicates were subjected to Probit Analysis using Python 3.7 program to determine LC 50, LC 90 and LC 95 values.
