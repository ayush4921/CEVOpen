0: This test has been conducted to evaluate the repulsive effect of essential oils against insects ( Sitophilus granarius).
1: This experiment was carried out by cutting an 8 cm diameter filter paper in half.
2: The six concentrations (10, 14, 18, 22, 26 and 30 L/mL) of essential oils were prepared in acetone.
3: Each half disk was treated with 100 L of the solution, and the other half with acetone.
4: After evaporation of acetone, the two treated parts were joined together by an adhesive tape and placed in a petri dish.
5: Ten insects were placed in the center of each petri dish and were incubated at 30 C. After two hours of incubation, the number of insects present in the part treated with essential oil and the number of insects present in the part treated only with acetone were counted, as described by Mc Donald [ 35].
