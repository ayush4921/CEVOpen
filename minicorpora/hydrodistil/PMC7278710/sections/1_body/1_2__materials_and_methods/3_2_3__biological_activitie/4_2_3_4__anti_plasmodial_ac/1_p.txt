0: Ledoux et al.
1: method [ 36] was used to determine anti-plasmodial activity.
2: To do so, asexual erythrocyte stages of  P. falciparum, chloroquine-sensitive strain 3D7 were continuously cultivated in vitro using the procedure of Trager and Jensen.
3: The erythrocyte had been initially obtained from a patient from Schipol in the Netherlands (BEI Reagent Search) [ 37].
4: ATCC, Bei Ressources provides us with the strains.
5: Red blood cells of A+ group were used as human host cell.
6: The culture medium was RPMI 1640 from Gibco, Fisher Scientific (Loughborough, UK) composed of NaHCO 3 (32 mM), HEPES (25 mM) and L-glutamine.
7: Glucose (1.76 g/L) from Sigma-Aldrich (Machelen, Belgium), hypoxanthine (44 mg/mL) from Sigma-Aldrich (Machelen, Belgium), gentamin (100 mg/mL) from Gibco Fisher Scientific (Loughborough, UK) and human pooled serum from A+ group (10%) were added to the medium according to [ 36, 38].
8: DMSO solutions of essential oils were directly diluted in the medium.
9: The dilutions were performed in triplicate by successive two-fold dilutions in a 96-well plate.
10: The essential oil concentrations are expressed in term of g/mL of essential oil.
11: As interaction between volatile compounds between samples could occur, we decided to alternate one test line with two lines filled with culture media.
12: The growth of the parasite was recorded after 48 h of incubation using lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) activity as parameter according to Makker method [ 39].
13: A positive control was used in all the repetitions.
14: This positive control was composed of Artemisinin from Sigma-Aldrich (Machelen, Belgium) at a concentration of 100 g/mL.
15: Sigmoidal curves allowed the determination of half inhibitory concentration (IC 50).
