<p>Ledoux et al. method [
 <xref rid="B36-foods-09-00550" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] was used to determine anti-plasmodial activity. To do so, asexual erythrocyte stages of 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, chloroquine-sensitive strain 3D7 were continuously cultivated in vitro using the procedure of Trager and Jensen. The erythrocyte had been initially obtained from a patient from Schipol in the Netherlands (BEI Reagent Search) [

 <sub>3</sub> (32 mM), HEPES (25 mM) and L-glutamine. Glucose (1.76 g/L) from Sigma-Aldrich (Machelen, Belgium), hypoxanthine (44 mg/mL) from Sigma-Aldrich (Machelen, Belgium), gentamin (100 mg/mL) from Gibco Fisher Scientific (Loughborough, UK) and human pooled serum from A+ group (10%) were added to the medium according to [

 <xref rid="B38-foods-09-00550" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. DMSO solutions of essential oils were directly diluted in the medium. The dilutions were performed in triplicate by successive two-fold dilutions in a 96-well plate. The essential oil concentrations are expressed in term of µg/mL of essential oil. As interaction between volatile compounds between samples could occur, we decided to alternate one test line with two lines filled with culture media. The growth of the parasite was recorded after 48 h of incubation using lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) activity as parameter according to Makker method [
 <xref rid="B39-foods-09-00550" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. A positive control was used in all the repetitions. This positive control was composed of Artemisinin from Sigma-Aldrich (Machelen, Belgium) at a concentration of 100 µg/mL. Sigmoidal curves allowed the determination of half inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>).
