0: The hydrogen atom- or electron-donating ability of essential oils and Trolox was determined from the bleaching of the purple-colored methanol DPPH solution.
1: Briefly, the samples were tested at 25, 50, 75 and 100 g/mL.
2: Ten microliters of various concentrations (1 to 5 mg/mL) of each essential oil in methanol were added to 1990 L of a 10 mg/mL DPPH methanol solution (0.06 mM).
3: Free radical scavenging activities of leaf, trunk bark and fruit essential oils hydrodistillated from  Z. leprieurii were determined spectrophotometrically [ 28].
4: The mixture was vortexed for about 1 min and then incubated at room temperature in the dark for 30 min; absorbance was measured at 517 nm with an Ultrospec UV-visible, dual beam spectrophotometer (GE Healthcare, Cambridge, UK).
5: The same sample procedure was followed for Trolox (Sigma, Darmstadt, Germany) used as standard; methanol (Sigma, Darmstadt, Germany) with DPPH was used as control; and all the samples were tested in triplicate.
6: The optical density was recorded, and the inhibition percentage was calculated using the formula given below: Inhibition percentage of DPPH activity (%) = (Abs Blank-Abs sample)/(Abs blank)  100  (1) Abs Blank = absorbance of the blank sample, Abs sample = absorbance of the test sample
