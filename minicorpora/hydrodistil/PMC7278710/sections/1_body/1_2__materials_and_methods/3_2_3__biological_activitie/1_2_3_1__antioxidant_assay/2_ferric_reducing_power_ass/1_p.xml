<p>The ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) of essential oils hydrodistillated from 
 <italic>Z. leprieurii</italic> was determined here. Briefly, four dilutions of essential oils and Trolox were prepared in methanol (25, 50, 75 and 100 µg/mL). Trolox was used as the standard reference. One mL of those methanol solutions were melded with one mL of a phosphate buffer (0.2 M, pH = 6.6) and with one mL of a potassium ferricyanide solution (1%; K
 <sub>3</sub>Fe(CN)
 <sub>6</sub>). After 20 min at 50 °C and the addition of one mL of trichloroacetic acid (TCA; 10% 
 <italic>v/v</italic>), the solution was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min [

In comparison with the blank, a higher absorbance shows a high reducing power. For all concentrations, absorbance due to essential oil samples were removed from each measurement.
