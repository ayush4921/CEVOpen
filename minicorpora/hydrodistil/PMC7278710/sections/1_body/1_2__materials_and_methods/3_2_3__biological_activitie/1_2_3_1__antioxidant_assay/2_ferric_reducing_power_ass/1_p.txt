0: The ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) of essential oils hydrodistillated from  Z. leprieurii was determined here.
1: Briefly, four dilutions of essential oils and Trolox were prepared in methanol (25, 50, 75 and 100 g/mL).
2: Trolox was used as the standard reference.
3: One mL of those methanol solutions were melded with one mL of a phosphate buffer (0.2 M, pH = 6.6) and with one mL of a potassium ferricyanide solution (1%; K 3Fe(CN) 6).
4: After 20 min at 50 C and the addition of one mL of trichloroacetic acid (TCA; 10%  v/v), the solution was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min [ 27, 28, 29].
5: Next, 1.5 mL of the upper phase was recovered and melded with 1.5 mL of distillated water and 150 L of FeCl 3 (0.1%  v/v).
6: Each concentration was realized as triplicated.
7: Finally, the absorbance of the prepared sample was measured at 700 nm.
8: In comparison with the blank, a higher absorbance shows a high reducing power.
9: For all concentrations, absorbance due to essential oil samples were removed from each measurement.
