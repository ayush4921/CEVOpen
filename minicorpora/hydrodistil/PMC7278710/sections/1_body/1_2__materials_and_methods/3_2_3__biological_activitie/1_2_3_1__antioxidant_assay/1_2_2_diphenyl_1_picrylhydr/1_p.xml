<p>The hydrogen atom- or electron-donating ability of essential oils and Trolox was determined from the bleaching of the purple-colored methanol DPPH solution. Briefly, the samples were tested at 25, 50, 75 and 100 µg/mL. Ten microliters of various concentrations (1 to 5 mg/mL) of each essential oil in methanol were added to 1990 μL of a 10 mg/mL DPPH methanol solution (0.06 mM). Free radical scavenging activities of leaf, trunk bark and fruit essential oils hydrodistillated from

The mixture was vortexed for about 1 min and then incubated at room temperature in the dark for 30 min; absorbance was measured at 517 nm with an Ultrospec UV-visible, dual beam spectrophotometer (GE Healthcare, Cambridge, UK). The same sample procedure was followed for Trolox (Sigma, Darmstadt, Germany) used as standard; methanol (Sigma, Darmstadt, Germany) with DPPH was used as control; and all the samples were tested in triplicate. The optical density was recorded, and the inhibition percentage was calculated using the formula given below:
 <disp-formula>Inhibition percentage of DPPH activity (%) = (Abs Blank-Abs sample)/(Abs blank) × 100
  <label>(1)</label>
 </disp-formula> Abs Blank = absorbance of the blank sample, Abs sample = absorbance of the test sample
