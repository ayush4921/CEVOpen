<p>Two different assays, DPPH and FRAP, were conducted in this study to evaluate the antioxidant potential of essential oils hydrodistillated from 
 <italic>Z. leprieurii</italic> leaves, trunk bark and fruits. The two different tests resulted in dissimilar results, as leaf and fruit oils gave the highest and the lowest antioxidant activities with the DPPH free radical scavenging assay, respectively; while in the ferric-reducing antioxidant power assay, the highest antioxidant activities were obtained with leaf and fruit oils. Variations in the antioxidant activities of essential oils evaluated by DPPH and FRAP methods are probably due to the differences in reagents used by each method [

 <italic>Z. leprieurii</italic> organs have interesting antioxidant properties, which originate from two different modes of action: free radical scavenging and reducing abilities. The various compounds in essential oils hydrodistillated from 
 <italic>Z. leprieurii</italic> organs are probably the origin of those different antioxidant activities [
