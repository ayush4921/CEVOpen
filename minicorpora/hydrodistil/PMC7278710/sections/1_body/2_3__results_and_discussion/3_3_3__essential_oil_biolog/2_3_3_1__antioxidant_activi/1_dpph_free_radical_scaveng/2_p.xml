<p>The results (
 <xref rid="foods-09-00550-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>) showed that all essential oil samples were able to reduce the stable DPPH radical to yellow diphenylpicrylhydrazine, with the scavenging effects increasing with higher essential oil concentrations (
 <italic>p</italic>-value ˂ 0.05). Leaf essential oil had the highest antioxidant activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 33.12 ± 0.07 µg/mL), followed by trunk bark oil (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 65.68 ± 0.12 µg/mL) and fruit oil (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 103,55 ± 0.35 µg/mL). The comparison with the Trolox standard (29.13 ± 0.04 µg/mL) showed that the selected leaf essential oil sample has a high antioxidant activity. This activity could be due to the high contents in β-caryophyllene and thymol of this essential oil, as both of those molecules are already known for their antioxidant properties [
