<p>High DPPH free radical scavenging activity was also described in leaf essential oils from other 
 <italic>Zanthoxylum</italic> species; with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 27.00 ± 0.1 µg/mL for Indian samples [
 <xref rid="B58-foods-09-00550" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. However, our results strongly differed to those of Tchabong [
 <xref rid="B40-foods-09-00550" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], who obtained IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 770 µg/mL and 1800 µg/mL for 
 <italic>Z. leprieurii</italic> fruit and leaf oils from Cameroon, respectively. Those differences in antioxidant properties of essential oil samples from the same species and families collected at different sites and at different periods are probably due to differences in their chemical compositions. Those differences may come from the studied organ, as we showed that essential oil composition variability mainly comes from the chosen organ, but also from genetic factors and/or environmental factors.
