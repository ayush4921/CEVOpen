<p>As mentioned previously, 
 <italic>Z. leprieurii</italic> is widely used in traditional medicine for the treatment of different afflictions. Several authors have already supported those uses by reporting interesting biological properties of essential oils and solvent extracts obtained from this species growing in different places. However, it was shown here that 
 <italic>Z. leprieurii</italic> essential oil chemical composition varies widely depending on the organ of the plant used and depending on the collection month. It is thus important to evaluate the biological activities of the essential oil hydrodistillated in this study, with regards to their compositions. Antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, insecticidal and anti-malarial properties of essential oils hydrodistillated from 
 <italic>Z. leprieurii</italic> growing in Côte d’Ivoire were then evaluated. Essential oils used for the biological activity tests were selected based on their chemical composition. The August-selected leaf essential oil sample was characterized by high amounts of tridecan-2-one (30.20%), β-caryophyllene (13.70%) and thymol (13.30%). The major compounds of the chosen July trunk bark sample were tridecan-2-one (51.40%), (
 <italic>E</italic>,
 <italic>E</italic>)-farnesol (11.10%) and β-caryophyllene (8.50%). Finally, the July fruit sample was characterized by high proportions of β-myrcene (16.40%), caryophyllene oxide (9.60%), (
 <italic>E</italic>)-β-ocimene (8.30%) and decanal (8.30%).
