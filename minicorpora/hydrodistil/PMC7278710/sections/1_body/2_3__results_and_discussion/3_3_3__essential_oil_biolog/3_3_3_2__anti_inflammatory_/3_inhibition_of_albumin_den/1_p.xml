<p>In vitro anti-inflammatory properties of 
 <italic>Z. leprieurii</italic> trunk bark, leaf and fruit essential oils were evaluated by the anti-denaturation method of bovine albumin serum (BSA) for the first time, in comparison with the control Diclofenac (IC50: 21.90 ± 0.08 µg/mL). The results (
 <xref rid="foods-09-00550-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>) showed that 
 <italic>Z. leprieurii</italic> leaf, fruit and trunk bark essential oils have high-to-moderate anti-inflammatory activities, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 26.08 ± 0.12 µg/mL, 26.68 ± 0.09 µg/mL and 35.07 ± 0.15 µg/mL, respectively. Moreover, the percentage of BSA protection was dependent on essential oil concentrations (
 <italic>p</italic>-value ˂ 0.05). The origin of these high lipoxygenase inhibitory activities could be the difference in organ content of monoterpenes, methylketones and sesquiterpenes, which are known for their anti-inflammatory activities [
