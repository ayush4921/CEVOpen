<p>The anti-plasmodial activity of 
 <italic>Z. leprieurii</italic> trunk bark, leaf and fruit essential oils was evaluated here for the first time. The results (
 <xref rid="foods-09-00550-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>) showed that trunk bark essential oil has a moderate anti-plasmodial activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 37.49 ± 4.2 µg/mL), and leaf essential oil has a low activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 59.30 ± 3.4 µg/mL), in comparison with the artemisinin standard (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 0.004 ± 0.001 µg/mL). No significant anti-plasmodial activity was highlighted for the fruit essential oil (IC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 100). The moderate trunk bark anti-plasmodial activity may be due to methylketones, as tridecan-2-one is the dominant compound in this oil. However, no studies have yet shown the anti-plasmodial activity of this molecule. Moreover, it is possible that the highlighted activity comes from the presence of minor compounds, as well as from the synergy between different molecules. Nevertheless, studies were carried out on 
 <italic>Z. leprieurii</italic> and other species of 
 <italic>Z. chalybeum</italic> and 
 <italic>Z. zanthoxyloides</italic> plant extracts, showing high anti-plasmodial activities [
