<p>Results showed that all essential oils were efficient to kill insects in 24 h, with trunk bark oil showing the highest insecticidal activity (LC
 <sub>50</sub> = 8.87 µL/mL) in comparison with leaf and fruit essential oils (LC
 <sub>50</sub> = 15.77 µL/mL and 11.26 µL/mL, respectively); those activities were slightly lower than those of the chemical insecticide Talisma UL (LC
 <sub>50</sub> = 3.44 µL/mL). Moreover, in comparison with cinnamon (
 <italic>Cinnamomum zeylanicum</italic>) and clove (
 <italic>Syzygium aromaticum</italic>) essential oils, generally described as exhibiting high insecticidal activities [
 <xref rid="B72-foods-09-00550" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], LC
 <sub>50</sub> of 
 <italic>Z. leprieurii</italic> essential oils is lower, showing better insecticidal activities of the latter and thus promising prospects for application in the protection of stored foodstuffs. Concerning LC
 <sub>90</sub> and LC
 <sub>95</sub>, results showed that the chemical insecticide (LC
 <sub>90</sub> = 27.83 µL/mL, LC
 <sub>95</sub> = 56.66 µL/mL) was less effective than leaf essential oil (LC
 <sub>90</sub> = 26.27 µL/mL, LC
 <sub>95</sub> = 31.26 µL/mL) and trunk bark essential oil (LC
 <sub>90</sub> = 23.69 µL/mL, LC
 <sub>95</sub> = 33.10 µL/mL), but more effective than fruit essential oils (LC
 <sub>90</sub> = 93.20 µL/mL, LC
 <sub>95</sub> = 191.20 µL/mL). These data indicate that the insecticidal effect of essential oils varies depending on the chemical composition and synergistic effects occurring between the compounds [
 <xref rid="B73-foods-09-00550" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. In this study, essential oils hydrodistillated from 
 <italic>Z. leprieurii</italic> organs had an interesting effect on 
 <italic>Sitophilus granarius</italic> adults, as insecticidal activities were better than those of 
 <italic>Z. fagara</italic> and 
 <italic>Z. monoplyllum</italic> (LC
 <sub>50</sub> of 153.9 µL/mL and 140.1 µL/mL, respectively) [
 <xref rid="B74-foods-09-00550" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]; and the LC
 <sub>50</sub> was better than those reported on larvicidal activity [
 <xref rid="B75-foods-09-00550" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] with 
 <italic>Z. leprieurii</italic> extracts and 
 <italic>Z. avicennae</italic> essential oil [
 <xref rid="B76-foods-09-00550" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. It should be noted that chemical composition of essential oils is different among these 
 <italic>Zanthoxylum</italic> species and, according to the author [
 <xref rid="B77-foods-09-00550" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>], mortality evolution showed that toxicity depends on aspects such as the chemical composition and the target insect sensitivity.
