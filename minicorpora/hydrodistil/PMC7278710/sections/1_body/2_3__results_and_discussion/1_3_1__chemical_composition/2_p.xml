<p>Essential oils hydrodistillated from 
 <italic>Z. leprieurii</italic> organs were analyzed by GC/MS. Representative chromatograms for essential oils hydrodistillated from each organ are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-09-00550-f001">Figure 1</xref>. Compounds accounting for 97.70–99.50% of global essential oil compositions were identified in the samples. Essential oils hydrodistillated from leaves were dominated by hydrocarbon sesquiterpenes, while methyl ketones were mainly present in trunk bark essential oils. Oxygenated and hydrocarbon monoterpenes were dominant in fruit essential oils. The major compounds identified in these oils were tridecan-2-one and β-caryophyllene in the leaf oils, tridecan-2-one in the trunk bark oils and β-myrcene in the fruit oils.
