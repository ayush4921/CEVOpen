 <italic>Z. leprieurii</italic> organs were collected over a period of seven months for the leaves and trunk barks and five months for the fruits within one single year. Meteorological data were recorded during the collection period (
 <xref rid="foods-09-00550-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The highest rainfall values were recorded in May, June, October and November, with 164.50 mm, 205.70 mm, 310.80 mm and 206.40 mm. In July and August, the rainfall was moderate, with 71.30 mm and 61.70 mm, respectively. The same trend was observed for the temperature. However, temperature variations were low during the collection period, with temperature ranging from 28.40 °C to 25.00 °C. The trends observed for these two variables in addition to those of relative humidity and daylight confirm that the months of May, June, October and November represent rainy season months; while those of July, August and September were dry season months.

 <xref rid="foods-09-00550-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, in bold) showed that essential oil yields obtained in this study (0.02 to 0.04% (
 <italic>w/w</italic>) for leaves, 0.86 to 1.20% (
 <italic>w/w</italic>) for trunk bark and 1.13 to 1.51% (

Essential oil yields seem dependent on meteorological variations, as, for each organ, the highest yields were observed in July and August, the collecting moment when the lowest precipitations and temperatures were recorded. When precipitations increased and temperatures were higher, the lowest essential oil yields were obtained. However, as temperature and yields variations were low in this study, those results should to be confirmed with a longer experiment. Results obtained here, though, are supported by previous studies showing that lower precipitation induces higher essential oil yields [
