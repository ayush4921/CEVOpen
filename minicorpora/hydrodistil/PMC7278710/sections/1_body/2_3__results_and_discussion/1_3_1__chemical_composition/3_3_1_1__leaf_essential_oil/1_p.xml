<p>The analysis of essential oils hydrodistillated from leaves allowed for the identification of 42 compounds ranging from 97.70% to 99.50% of the total composition (
 <xref rid="foods-09-00550-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Sesquiterpenes (34.89–70.8%), methylketones (13.10–42.40%) and monoterpenes (4.5–36.18%) were the main components of these essential oils, which were dominated by tridecan-2-one (9.00% to 36.80%) and β-caryophyllene (7.00% to 19.85%). However, the composition of leaf essential oils was not constant over the collecting period, as some compounds that were present in only a minority in some samples were found in higher quantities during certain months. As a first example, there is a drop in tridean-2-one production in June, which is tricky to explain. This is also the case with (

Caryophyllene oxide, which represented 5.7–6% of the total oil compositions from June to July, was only found in trace amounts during the other months. Undecan-2-one was also exceptionally present at 8% in May and August. Dendrolasin was present in significant amounts (4–16.4%) in all months except in May. This last molecule has well-known antimicrobial and antibacterial properties, and is also used in the treatment of cancer [

Most of the major compounds that were detected in leaf essential oils are already known for their beneficial biological activities, such as insecticidal, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. For example, the β-caryophyllene is a molecule characterized by high antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities [
