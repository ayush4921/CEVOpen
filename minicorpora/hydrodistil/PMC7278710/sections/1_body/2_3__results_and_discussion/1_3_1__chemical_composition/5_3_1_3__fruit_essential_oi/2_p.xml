<p>The essential oils hydrodistillated from 
 <italic>Z. leprieurii</italic> fruits during different months mainly contained monoterpenes hydrocarbons, which is in agreement with the chemical composition of fruit essential oils of the same species studied in Cameroon. Indeed, two different studies conducted in two distinct Cameroon sites showed citronellol (29.90% [

 <xref rid="B49-foods-09-00550" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]) as the major compounds. Nevertheless, the chemical compositions characterized here are different from those already described. As essential oils obtained here and in previous studies were not hydrodistillated from plants growing in the same place and during the same period, differences in chemical compositions can be explained by climatic and environmental factors depending on each country, while one also cannot exclude a genetic influence that would combine with the other factors of variability.
