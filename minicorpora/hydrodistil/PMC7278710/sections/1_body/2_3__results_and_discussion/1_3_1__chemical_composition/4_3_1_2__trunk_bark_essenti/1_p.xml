<p>In total, 29 compounds were identified in the seven trunk bark oil samples, accounting for 98.30–99.40% of the whole composition (

Essential oils hydrodistillated from trunk bark were dominated by tridecan-2-one (45.26–78.80%) and α-humulene, which was also present in a significant content (4.3–12.73%). Hydrocarbon monoterpenes were only present as traces. As for leaf essential oils, the composition of essential oils hydrodistillated from the trunk bark was not consistent during the studied period. Indeed, some sesquiterpenes were only present in high a content during a given period: β-caryophyllene (8.1–13.20%) from May to July and September; tridecan-2-ol was found up to 10.10% in June; and (

Those differences may be due to the harvesting season and to the harvesting sites, which were not the same in those studies [
