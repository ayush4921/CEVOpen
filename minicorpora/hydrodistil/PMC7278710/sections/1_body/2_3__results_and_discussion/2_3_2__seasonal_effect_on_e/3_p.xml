<p>For the PCA analysis, the chemical composition data were projected through linear combinations of the 15 variables that were identified in all samples. Results showed that the first two axes (F1 and F2) explained 64.32% of the total variance (F1: 36.41% and F2: 27.92%). PCA results (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-09-00550-f004">Figure 4</xref>) showed three different specific clusters, each one being represented by one plant organ. Fruit essential oil samples in cluster I were mainly composed of β-myrcene (36.78 ± 14.67%), citronellol (9.98 ± 10.75%), geraniol (6.14 ± 4.42%), methyl nerate (5.64 ± 0.86%) and geraniol (4.36 ± 2.32%). Cluster II included trunk bark essential oil samples dominated by methylketones with tridecan-2-one (61.56 ± 12.65%) as the principal component. However, α- humulene (7.67 ± 2.71%), β-caryophyllene (6.82 ± 4.25%) and tridecan-2-ol (5.95 ± 2.58%) were also present in significant amounts. Cluster III included the leaf oil samples that were mainly composed of tridecan-2-one (24.11 ± 10.47%), β-caryophyllene (13.97 ± 4.94 %), dendrolasin (8.34 ± 4.72) and α-humulene (4.82 ± 1.29%). This group also showed high levels of (
