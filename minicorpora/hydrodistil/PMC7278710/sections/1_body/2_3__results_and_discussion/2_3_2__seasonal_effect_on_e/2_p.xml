<p>The HCA dendrogram (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-09-00550-f003">Figure 3</xref>), based on the Euclidean distance between collected samples, showed three distinct clusters, each one specific to one plant organ: (i) cluster I for fruits; (ii) cluster II for trunk bark; and (iii) cluster III for leaves. This shows that there is a significant difference in the composition of essential oils hydrodistillated from different 
 <italic>Z. leprieurii</italic> organs. In addition, a seasonal effect was observed among each group, showing variation in the compositions of essential oils hydrodistillated from the same organ during the collection period. This seasonal effect was higher for the leaf essential oils, as the intra-class variance for those samples (2.50) was higher than for the fruit (1.77) and for the trunk bark (0.35) samples. It is possible that this higher variance for leaf essential oil samples is related to the fact that new leaves are produced all year long, while fruits are only produced at certain times of the year and the trunk bark develops very slowly over a period of several months or years. Leaves are then more susceptible to seasonal variations, such as levels of light exposure, state of maturity and water stress, than fruits and the trunk bark. Trunk bark essential oils have a lower chemical variability, probably due to the fact that the trunk bark formation is slow, and thus less impacted by environmental factors [

 <italic>Zanthoxylum</italic> species [

Indeed, while the chemical compositions of essential oils are genetically determined, it can be considerably modified by factors such as temperature, light, seasonality, water availability and nutrition. Biosynthesis of different compounds can be induced by environmental stimuli, which can change metabolic pathways [
