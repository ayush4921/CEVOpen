<p>Food safety can be considered as a priority, since foodborne diseases have emerged as a serious public health problem, besides leading to huge economic and social losses worldwide, especially in low− and middle−income countries. Our results reveal a promising activity of EOs from Cerrado plants against foodborne bacteria, revealing their potentialities for the development of new agents to prevent the spreading of resistant bacterial contamination in the food production chain, contributing to reduce the risks of foodborne diseases. Further toxicological studies are required for safety purposes.</p>
