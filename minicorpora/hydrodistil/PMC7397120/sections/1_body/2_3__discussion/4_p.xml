 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> is an important causative agent of bovine mastitis, which is one of the most costâˆ’intensive diseases in the dairy industry [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-25-03296" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Furthermore, enterotoxigenic 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains have the potential to induce foodborne intoxications in humans transmitted by dairy products. A recent study evaluated over a thousand milk samples and revealed that 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> can effectively enter the dairy production chain via contaminated milk with subclinical 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> intramammary infections [
