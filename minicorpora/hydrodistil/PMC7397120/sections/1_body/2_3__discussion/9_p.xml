<p>Although the antimicrobial effects and chemical composition of the plants evaluated in the present study have not been previously investigated, species belonging to the same genera as those investigated herein are known to exhibit antimicrobial properties. The EOs from flowers and fruits of 
 <italic>Chromolaena laevigata</italic> were investigated for their chemical composition and antimicrobial activity, showing an MIC of 62.5 mg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup> against 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, and an MIC of 500 mg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup> against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-25-03296" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The EO from the leaves of 
 <italic>Campomanesia adamantium</italic> showed high activity against 
 <italic>S. aureus, P. aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> and was moderately active against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, and its main compounds were found to be monoterpenes, such as limonene, α−pinene and β−pinene [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-25-03296" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The EO extracted from the leaves of 
 <italic>Campomanesia guazumifolia</italic> (Cambess.) O. Berg strongly inhibited the strains of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MIC 15 ± 0.1 µg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>), 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (MIC 25 ± 0.2 µg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) and 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> (MIC 5 ± 0.1 µg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>). Sixty−eight compounds were identified in its oil, of which the main constituents were bicyclogermacrene (15%), globulol (5%) and spathulenol (5%) [
