<p>The EOs of 
 <italic>C. squalida</italic>, 
 <italic>C. sessilifora</italic> and 
 <italic>My. guianensis</italic> showed the most potent antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> sp. 841 resistant to ampicillin, doxycycline and clindamicyn, isolated from milk samples produced by cows affected by mastitis, with MIC values ranging from 7.80 to 31.25 µg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>. Among these bioactive EOs, emphasis should be given to that from 
 <italic>C. squalida</italic>, which strongly inhibited this bacterium with the lowest MIC, whose value is considered a good result even for pure substances [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-25-03296" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. All tested oils were moderately active (MICs 250 to 500 µg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> sp. 873, also isolated from milk, however showing a larger resistance profile (penicillins, including oxacillin, tetracyclines, lincosamides, quinolones, macrolides and second generation cephalosporines), as well as against the standard strain of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MICs 125 to 500 µg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>).
