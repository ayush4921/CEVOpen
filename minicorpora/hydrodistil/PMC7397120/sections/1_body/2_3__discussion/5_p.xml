<p>It is notable that, regarding the chemical composition, the main components of the four EOs analyzed are mostly non oxygenated mono− and sesquiterpenes. In addition, the major components of 
 <italic>C. squalida</italic> oil, with the best activity profile, are also present in the other EOs, however, in different proportions. The synergistic effect of these components in variable concentrations might therefore be overwhelming. Antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>Candida guilliermondii</italic> was also reported for EOs rich in compounds similar to those found in 
 <italic>C. squalida</italic>, such as EO from the leaves of 
 <italic>Duguetia gardneriana</italic> (Annonaceae), with germacrene D (28.1%), viridiflorene (24.0%), β−pinene (12.6%), α−pinene (9.1%) and β−caryophyllene (5.6%) as its main constituents [

 <italic>C. squalida</italic> oil, proved active against 
 <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> [

 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> [

 <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-25-03296" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Pieri et al. (2016) [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-25-03296" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] evaluated β−caryophyllene against 32 microorganisms linked to bacterial dental plaque formation in dogs, of which, 24 were sensitive to this sesquiterpene at concentrations up to 100 mg·mL
