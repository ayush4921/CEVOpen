<p>The antimicrobial activity of the essential oils was determined by the broth microdilution method, as described by Manda et al. (2018) [
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-25-03296" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Two−fold dilutions were performed in 96−well plates prepared with Mueller–Hinton broth to reach a final concentration of 1.95 to 4000 μg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>, with a 100 μL final volume in each well. The inoculums were overnight cultures of each bacterial species in Mueller–Hinton agar diluted in sterile saline solution (0.45%) to a concentration of approximately 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>. This solution was diluted 1/10 in saline solution (0.45%) and 5 μL was added to each well containing the test samples. All experiments were performed in triplicate and the microdilution trays were incubated at 36 °C for 18 h. Then, 20 μL of an aqueous solution (0.5%) of triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) was added to each well and the trays were again incubated at 36 °C for 2 h. In those wells where bacterial growth did occur, TTC changed from colorless to red. MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of each substance at which no color change occurred and was expressed in μg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>.
