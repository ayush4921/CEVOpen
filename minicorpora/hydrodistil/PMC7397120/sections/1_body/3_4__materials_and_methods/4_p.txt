0: Chromatography conditions.
1: Injector temperature was 250 C, with the carrier gas (helium) at a flow rate of 1 mLmin 1, pressure of 87.1 kPa and column oven temperature programmed to 50260 C (3 C/min).
2: A mixture of linear hydrocarbons (C9 to C22 alkanes) was injected under the same experimental conditions.
3: The identification of the constituents in the essential oil was performed by comparing the mass spectra obtained with those of the equipment database (Wiley 7 lib and Nist 08 lib) and by using the retention index (RI), calculated for each constituent as previously described [ 24].
