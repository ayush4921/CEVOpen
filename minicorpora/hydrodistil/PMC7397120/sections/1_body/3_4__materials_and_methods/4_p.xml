 <bold>Chromatography conditions.</bold> Injector temperature was 250 °C, with the carrier gas (helium) at a flow rate of 1 mL·min
 <sup>−1</sup>, pressure of 87.1 kPa and column oven temperature programmed to 50–260 °C (3 °C/min). A mixture of linear hydrocarbons (C9 to C22 alkanes) was injected under the same experimental conditions. The identification of the constituents in the essential oil was performed by comparing the mass spectra obtained with those of the equipment database (Wiley 7 lib and Nist 08 lib) and by using the retention index (RI), calculated for each constituent as previously described [
