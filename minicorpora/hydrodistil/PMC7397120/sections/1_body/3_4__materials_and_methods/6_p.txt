0: The antimicrobial activity of the essential oils was determined by the broth microdilution method, as described by Manda et al.
1: (2018) [ 49].
2: Twofold dilutions were performed in 96well plates prepared with MuellerHinton broth to reach a final concentration of 1.95 to 4000 gmL 1, with a 100 L final volume in each well.
3: The inoculums were overnight cultures of each bacterial species in MuellerHinton agar diluted in sterile saline solution (0.45%) to a concentration of approximately 10 8 CFUmL 1.
4: This solution was diluted 1/10 in saline solution (0.45%) and 5 L was added to each well containing the test samples.
5: All experiments were performed in triplicate and the microdilution trays were incubated at 36 C for 18 h. Then, 20 L of an aqueous solution (0.5%) of triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) was added to each well and the trays were again incubated at 36 C for 2 h. In those wells where bacterial growth did occur, TTC changed from colorless to red.
6: MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of each substance at which no color change occurred and was expressed in gmL 1.
