0: Brazilian flora, enclosed in biomes such as Pantanal and Cerrado, represents one of the highest potentials concerning biological diversity.
1: The Cerrado biome, one of the largest Brazilian ecosystems, covers about 21% of the Brazilian territory and houses roughly 12,000 species of plants [ 19], ca.
2: 30% endemic [ 20].
3: However, its extensive degradation and lack of sustainable management, which has been intensified in recent years, have caused severe losses in Cerrados biodiversity, reinforcing its position as a world hotspot for the conservation of biodiversity, since it presents circa onethird of the biological diversity of Brazil and 5% of the globe [ 21, 22].
4: Although several bioactive molecules have been identified from plants of this biome [ 23], the Cerrado flora still offers a wide biodiversity of species that remains unexplored.
5: Therefore, the Cerrado consists of a promising source of natural products to be investigated regarding their potential for the prevention/treatment of bacterial infections.
