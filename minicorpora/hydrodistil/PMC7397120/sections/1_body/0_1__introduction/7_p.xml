<p>Brazilian flora, enclosed in biomes such as Pantanal and Cerrado, represents one of the highest potentials concerning biological diversity. The Cerrado biome, one of the largest Brazilian ecosystems, covers about 21% of the Brazilian territory and houses roughly 12,000 species of plants [

However, its extensive degradation and lack of sustainable management, which has been intensified in recent years, have caused severe losses in Cerrado’s biodiversity, reinforcing its position as a world hotspot for the conservation of biodiversity, since it presents circa one−third of the biological diversity of Brazil and 5% of the globe [

Therefore, the Cerrado consists of a promising source of natural products to be investigated regarding their potential for the prevention/treatment of bacterial infections.
