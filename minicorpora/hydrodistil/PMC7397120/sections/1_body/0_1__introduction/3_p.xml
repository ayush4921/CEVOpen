<p>The most common foodborne disease worldwide is food poisoning caused by 
 <italic>Staphylococcus</italic>, considered one of the main pathogens responsible for disease outbreaks related to the consumption of contaminated food [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-25-03296" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. It can be found in several foods, but milk and its derivatives are among the main sources of contamination, since they are good substrates for the growth of different 
 <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> types and production of enterotoxins [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-25-03296" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Some studies have shown that these staphylococcal enterotoxins can retain their biological activities even after the pasteurization process [

 <xref rid="B8-molecules-25-03296" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In addition, this bacterium causes bovine mastitis (inflammation of the mammary gland in the udder of dairy cows), leading to a reduction in milk quality and yield, which causes considerable economic losses in livestock [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-25-03296" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These economic losses profoundly affect the economy of countries like Brazil, which is an important contributor to the dairy and meat market, as it leads the ranking of countries with the largest cattle herd (214.7 million head) [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-25-03296" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and is the fifth country with the highest milk production [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-25-03296" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].
