0: Plant natural products represent an important source of bioactive molecules, since these organisms produce a myriad of complex and structurally diverse chemical compounds, with great pharmacological potentials [ 12, 13].
1: Essential oils (EOs) are produced by plants and act in the defense against herbivores, and infections caused by microorganisms, as well as attracting pollinators, and in the plantplant or plantinsect interactions [ 14, 15].
2: In general, EOs consist of mixtures of 20 to 60 compounds, most of them belonging to the class of terpenoids (mono, sesqui and diterpenes) and their oxygenated and aromatic derivatives, in addition to aliphatic acid esters terpenoids and phenolic compounds (usually C 6C 3 derivatives) [ 16].
