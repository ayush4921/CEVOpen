<p>The analysis of the EOs obtained from 
 <italic>C. squalida</italic> and 
 <italic>My. guianensis</italic> revealed the presence of 40 and 28 components, respectively, mostly of the sesquiterpene−type, and with a predominance of hydrocarbon sesquiterpenes (78.04% and 91.36%, respectively). Among these compounds, viridiflorene (14.32%), germacrene D (12.74%), β−caryophyllene (12.54%) and δ−cadinene (11.60%) were the principal components of 
 <italic>C. squalida</italic>, while isocaryophyllene (21.81%) followed by valencene (11.52%) and δ−cadinene (11.03%) were those of
