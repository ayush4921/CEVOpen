<p>The EOs of 
 <italic>C. squalida</italic>, 
 <italic>C. sessiliflora</italic> and 
 <italic>My. guianensis</italic> showed good antimicrobial activity against the multi−resistant 
 <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> sp. 841, isolated from cow’s milk with bovine mastitis, with emphasis on 
 <italic>C. squalida</italic>, which showed the strongest activity (MIC of 7.80 µg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>). The remaining oils were moderately active against this bacterium. All samples also proved moderately active against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> sp. 873, as well as against the standard strains of 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, with MICs ranging from 500 to 125 µg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>. Except for 
 <italic>C. squalida</italic> and 
 <italic>S. guianensis</italic>, all samples were moderately active against the standard 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> strain. When evaluated against the β−lactamase producer 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhi 905 strains, the EOs of 
 <italic>Ma. guianensis</italic> and 
 <italic>C. sessiliflora</italic> also showed moderate activity, with an MIC of 500 µg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>, while the remaining samples proved inactive against these bacteria.
