 <p>Foodborne pathogens are a real public health concern in an escalating antimicrobial resistance scenario. Natural products represent a promising source of bioactive molecules, and essential oils have attracted much attention due to their myriad of biological properties, including antibacterial activities. In this context, essential oils obtained from the leaves of 
  <italic>Chromolaena squalida</italic>, 
  <italic>Campomanesia sessiliflora, Myrsine guianensis, Matayba guianensis, Siparuna guianensis, Ocotea minarum</italic> and 
  <italic>Endlicheria paniculata</italic>—species from the Cerrado biome of Midwest Brazil—were extracted and evaluated for their antibacterial activity against a panel of four standard and three clinical multidrug−resistant bacterial strains. All tested oils showed moderate to good activity against at least four bacterial strains, including 
  <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhi and oxacillin−resistant 
  <italic>Staphylococcus.</italic> The essential oils from 
  <italic>C. squalida</italic>, 
  <italic>C. sessiliflora</italic>, 
  <italic>My. guianensis</italic> and 
  <italic>Ma. guianensis</italic> showed strong inhibition of clinical 
  <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> strains, which cause bovine mastitis and are related to milk−borne diseases. Their chemical profiles were investigated by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC/MS), which revealed a predominance of mono− and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, some of which with well−known antimicrobial properties. The essential oil from Cerrado plants proved active against resistant Gram−positive and Gram−negative bacteria, revealing their potentialities for the development of new alternative agents to prevent the spreading of resistant bacterial contamination.
