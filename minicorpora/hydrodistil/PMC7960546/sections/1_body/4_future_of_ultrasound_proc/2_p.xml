<p id="p0305">One of the major accomplishments in the field of innovative extraction techniques has been the emergence of ultrasound-assisted extraction techniques that effectively uses knowledgeâ€™s into technology and consumer goods. A technique that has been developed to keep the production wheel running is the use of ultrasonic technology to extract food and natural extracts. Ultrasound-assisted extraction uses physical and chemical phenomena which differ basically from those used in conventional extraction methods. The method of ultrasound extraction will produce concentrated green extracts that are free of any residual solvents, contaminants or artifacts. The modern ultrasound model, developed till date, offers net yield and selectivity benefits, improves extraction time, extracts health and productivity, is easily integrated into the industry, and is environmentally friendly. These days, selection of technique to be used for extraction of desired compound from a particular plant should depend on the balance between extraction effectiveness and reproducibility, ease of operation, along with considerations of time, cost, protection and degree of automation. This overview addressed the existing significance of the principle of ultrasound extraction in the chemistry of natural products. A comprehensive review of present as well as past literature demonstrates the utility of this laboratory- and industrial-scale extraction method. We anticipate that this review will broaden the reach of laboratory and industrial/commercial success for possible applications of ultrasound technology in food and natural products extraction.</p>
