 <xref rid="b0525" ref-type="bibr">[105]</xref>. Food technology is currently a rapid evolving field of applied research and industry, under extreme or non-classical conditions. The production efficiency can be increased by using better alternatives to conventional extraction, processing and preservation techniques, futhermore it can lead to environmental conservation through reduced water/solvent use, minimizing wastewater and removal of harmful contaminants from processing.
