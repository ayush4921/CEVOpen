<p id="p0045">This review paper outlines the principle involved in ultrasound technique and its application in various food processing operations (filtration, extraction, freezing, etc.). As there is lack of awareness about combination of ultrasound with other conventional and emerging food processing technologies, the paper will also highlight the effects of application of ultrasound treatment when combined with other processing techniques such as thermal, microwave, enzymatic extraction, high pressure processing, etc.</p>
