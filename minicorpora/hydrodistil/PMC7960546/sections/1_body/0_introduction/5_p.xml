<p id="p0040">Ultrasound system has an important role in extraction, which help in determining the key design parameters of the extraction process like acoustic energy density, ultrasonic intensity, ultrasonic power and the operation mode (e.g. pulsed or non-pulsed) 
 <xref rid="b0855" ref-type="bibr">[171]</xref>. The ultrasonic bath and ultrasound probe-type method are the two different types of UAE instruments which are widely used for ultrasound applications (

The system can ease down the process of extraction with high reproducibility, less solvent consumption, simpler manipulation and work up, highly pure final product, elimination of wastewater after treatment and less consumption of fossil energy than normally required for conventional extraction techniques like Soxhlet extraction and Clevenger distillation 
 <xref rid="b0180" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. The system can effectively extract various compounds such as aromas, antioxidants, pigments and other organic compounds from food components both processed and formulated from a range of matrices (mostly animal tissue, yeasts, microalgae, food and plant materials).
