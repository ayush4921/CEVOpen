0: The utilization of new green and innovative techniques typically involves less time, water and energy in processing, pasteurization and extraction.
1: These techniques are ultrasound-assisted processing  [23],  [171], microwave processing  [145], extrusion  [77], supercritical fluid extraction and processing  [133],  [140], controlled pressure drop process  [141], pulse electromagnetic field  [95],  [139], subcritical water extraction  [128], and high pressure  [105].
2: Food technology is currently a rapid evolving field of applied research and industry, under extreme or non-classical conditions.
3: The production efficiency can be increased by using better alternatives to conventional extraction, processing and preservation techniques, futhermore it can lead to environmental conservation through reduced water/solvent use, minimizing wastewater and removal of harmful contaminants from processing.
