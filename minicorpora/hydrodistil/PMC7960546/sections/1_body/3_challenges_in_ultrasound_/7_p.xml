<p id="p0300">Most food products have a very high attenuation level, including plant tissues, aerated products, and certain semi-crystalline foods (chocolates), which can make measurement extremely difficult. Because of cleaning, fouling, and other practical constraints the use of a shorter path length might not be feasible in a real method. The use of lowfrequency decreases the resolution of spaces. For certain cases, multiple sample variables shift at the same time, and this will influence the ultrasonic properties. The simple sensor is not sufficient in this case, because it results in large and difficult peaks to overcome. If it is challenging to get very accurate and uniform control of temperature throughout the sample, additional errors may be introduced in further measuring the temperature-based property. The occurrence of air in the sample results in tremendous impedance mismatch between air bubbles and other food products, which allows air bubbles to reflect and a very fast dispersal. Ultrasound can also be used as a tool for the detection of included air which is not readily apparent otherwise.</p>
