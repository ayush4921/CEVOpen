<p id="p0290">The occurrence of tiny air bubbles in a solution can so much inhibit ultrasound that an ultrasound wave can't spread through the sample at times. This issue can be solved by taking measurements of reflection instead of transmission, although the signal from the air bubbles can interfere with other parts. A lot of information about the thermo-physical properties such as densities, compressibility, heat capacity and thermal conductivity of a material is required to make theoretical predictions of its ultrasonic properties. Therefore, theoretical analysis of the data from systems with several components of unknown properties is scanty.</p>
