<p id="p0275">The problems exist with non-standardized documentation of methodology and control parameters until the widespread implementation of the technology. Standardized documentation in terms of energy consumption, types of tests and volumes of samples would promote techno-economic evaluation before industrial implementation. Nonetheless, significant research and development activities are required to understand, simplify and implement this dynamic method to its maximum potential. The system must be rigorously tested and proven safe before it is commercially viable.</p>
