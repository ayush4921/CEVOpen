<p id="p0310">Ultrasound technique has demonstrated its potential for preservation, extraction, and processing in the food industry. In the agricultural/food industry, ultrasound is progressively used to improve different processes and has become an extremely promising tool on the manufacturing front. When used in addition to other food preservation methods, it enhances the effectiveness of the process. It has many benefits over other pre-existing technologies and, which when combined with them, helps to resolve their own limitations. The combination of ultrasound with different food processing technologies can improve process efficiency, reduce the time required for various processing operations,Â improvement in the overall rate of extraction and yield. Ultrasound has promised a revolutionary future with its capacity to increase productivity and decrease the time needed for different processing operations. The full food processing operations may be carried out with the help of ultrasound within few minutes or seconds, along with a reduction in total processing costs, delivering high final product purity levels, eliminating wastewater treatment, and post-processing with least resources. The lack of expertise, awareness, and inability to give up the conventional procedures prevents ultrasound from being adopted and commercialized at industrial levels. The knowledge that ultrasound technology can be combined with other existing and novel technologies will create awareness for commercial application of this technology and help in development of environmentally friendly technologies for industries particularly food industries.</p>
