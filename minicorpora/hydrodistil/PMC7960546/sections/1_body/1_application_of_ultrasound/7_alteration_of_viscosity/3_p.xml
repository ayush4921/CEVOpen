<p id="p0095">Ultrasound treatment at various power input, temperature, and time can affect rheology properties and starch slurries. Chen et al. 
 <xref rid="b0195" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, applied the high power ultrasound treatment (0–45 °C, 242–968 W/cm
 <sup>2</sup>, 2–16 min) on strawberry pulp. Authors observed that high power ultrasound treatment (605 W/cm
 <sup>2</sup> and 45 °C for 16 min) affects the rheological properties of strawberry pulp with an increase in the apparent viscosity, storage modulus (G′), and loss modulus (G″). Although the interaction of free Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> and low-methylated pectin was promoted by high power ultrasound, the network structure of Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> low-methylated pectin was formed, causing an increase in viscosity in the complex strawberry structure. Similarly, in ultrasound-treated (120 W for 20 min) starch gel, Kalinina et al., 
 <xref rid="b0430" ref-type="bibr">[86]</xref> found a decrease in viscosity; this effect being attributed to the reduction the amount of amylose in the starch gel with an increasing power and duration of ultrasonic exposure. It is therefore possible to use ultrasound to adjust the viscosity of starch solutions used in the food industry.
