<p id="p0080">Several research groups have used high intensity ultrasound to produce protein stabilized emulsions. For example, Li et al. 
 <xref rid="b0495" ref-type="bibr">[99]</xref> used high intensity ultrasound (frequency 20 kHz, applied power 450 W for 6 min) to improve the emulsifying properties of chicken myofibrillar protein and enhanced the rheological properties and storage ability of the myofibrillar protein stabilized emulsion. Results showed that the highest storage value (G' value) and contributed to the formation of better oil/water emulsion gel elasticity was observed at the 6 min ultrasound treatment. The petrochemical, chemical, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries often exploit this influence. US lower frequencies along with higher energy waves are basically utilized in the food sector for generation of mayonnaise, emulsions fruit juices, ketchup, and homogenized milk
