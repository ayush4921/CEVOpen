<p id="p0060">The study conducted by da Rocha and Norena 
 <xref rid="b0245" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref> extracted bioactive compounds from grape pomace using ultrasound treatment (250, 350, and 450 W for 5, 10, and 15 min) and observed that extraction performed for 10 min resulted in maximum anthocyanin content (45% more). Also, phenolics and anthocyanin were extracted from jabuticaba peels using ultrasound bath (at 25 and 40 kHz) and it was observed that maximum extraction took place at 25 kHz for10 min of exposure time 
 <xref rid="b0320" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>. Futhermore, similar studies were also conducted by Ochoa et al. 
 <xref rid="b0625" ref-type="bibr">[125]</xref> and Chakraborty et al. 
 <xref rid="b0165" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> for the extraction of bioactive compounds.
