 <xref rid="b0425" ref-type="bibr">[85]</xref> found that prior to drying, seaweed treated with ultrasound showed improved colour quality and decreased drying period and power costs. Pretreatment with ultrasound promotes weight control, water loss, shortened drying rate and solid gain development 
 <xref rid="b0635" ref-type="bibr">[127]</xref>. The influence on ultrasonic pretreatment prior to the drying of various parameters of ultrasound such as power, frequency, time, and amplitude, as well as drying kinetics and ultrasound-assisted efficiency were studied 
 <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. When food products are treated with ultrasound, they either gain or lose moisture. This happens because of the combined effect of gradient concentration between substance, ultrasound and liquid media 
 <xref rid="b0955" ref-type="bibr">[191]</xref>. The rate of drying is accelerated by the ultrasound application which may vary the result in certain cases. Ultrasound processing usually lowers the absorption of water, improves the colour of the substance and reduces the loss of nutrients: total phenolic content, flavonoid content, antioxidants activity, and vitamin C 
 <xref rid="b0405" ref-type="bibr">[81]</xref>. It was worth noting that ultrasound assisted dehydradtion pretreatment significantly reduces the oil content of fried samples and improves product color.
