<p id="p0105">Functioning on the implementations of sound waves for dehydrating indicates the limitation in dehydrate period at low air velocity and lower temperatures by about 20–30% 
 <xref rid="b0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. In vacuum drying 
 <xref rid="b0845" ref-type="bibr">[169]</xref> and freeze drying 
 <xref rid="b0205" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, ultrasound participates to the upsurge drying ratio as compare to convective drying over conventional methods. Ultrasound application, when put at 0 to 200 W for 15–30 min, can make microchannels inside cell shape that give rise to impairment of the tissue 
 <xref rid="b0455" ref-type="bibr">[91]</xref>. The treatment of eggplant with ultrasound prior to dehydrating prominently lowers the drying time in addition to microstructure conservation 
 <xref rid="b0720" ref-type="bibr">[144]</xref>. Cruz et al. 
 <xref rid="b0240" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref> stated that pre-drying with sound waves before the convective drying phase of grapes and plums inclines the amount of dehydration and drying kinetics besides improves the nature of the goods. Ultrasound proved efficacious in lowering the drying count because it increased mass transfer, consequently, effective drying by reducing power utilization also increasing the diffusivity of moisture 
 <xref rid="b0315" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. As cavitation of the fluid media carrying the specimen 
 <xref rid="b0620" ref-type="bibr">[124]</xref>, the mass transfer has been increased.
