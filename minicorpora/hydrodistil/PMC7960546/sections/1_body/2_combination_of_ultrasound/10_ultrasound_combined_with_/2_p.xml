<p id="p0230">Since current time, combined ultrasound with enzyme-assisted separation process in bioactive components, referred as Ultrasound assisted enzymatic extraction (UAEE), has been explored in certain researches

 <xref rid="b0185" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0305" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>,

 <xref rid="b0600" ref-type="bibr">[120]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0795" ref-type="bibr">[159]</xref>. The UAEE is known to be combined complementary strategies of extraction, providing a few extra points of interest. Enzymes encourage recuperation through the degradation and rupture of cell wall and films within enzyme-assisted extraction (EAE). Enzymes, in any case, such as cell walls, don't hydrolyze the matrix totally 
 <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0910" ref-type="bibr">[182]</xref>. UAE enhances the process of enzymatic extraction, as the cavity process is stimulated by ultrasonic power which easily break down the matrices, to permit enzyme aided reactions along with consequent discharge of targeted components. Contrary to this, the mass migration of solvents, target particles, and enzymes itself inside or in the exterior of the media can't be improved by enzymes alone. Hence, in EAE, other physical iterations such as shaking can be utilized to make strides in mass exchange, among which UAE is a perfect choice for its mass transfer enhancement, as it were not for exterior but moreover interior of the matrices

 <xref rid="b0415" ref-type="bibr">[83]</xref>. Apart from this, ultrasonic power within the UAE raised matrix surfaces and area of contact among stages, will uncover the enzymes to more substrates within the EAE treatment and contribute to the exposing of more target compounds. Several researches have emphasized about increase in enzymatic reaction rates in EAE due to ultrasonic treatment which can upgrade enzyme-substratum collisions and allow a better rate of discharge

 <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. A few other types of research have shown that through certain conditions, low-frequency ultrasound was competent in progressing the operation of cellulase

 <xref rid="b0615" ref-type="bibr">[123]</xref>. In a few cases, on the other side, the enzymatic reaction within the EAE might increase the effect of ultrasound within the UAEE in return. As said over, the impact of ultrasound would be significantly affected by the viscosity of the extrication system. While separating constituents, the consistency of the extraction process might be enhanced, especially when water is utilized as a dissolving agent due to the discharge of a few untargeted compounds, such as certain hydrocolloids. A few particular enzymes may corrupt numerous of these un-targeted compounds, bringing down the viscosity and resulting in about the negative viscous impact upon improvement of ultrasonic treatment. UAEE is utilized for extracting polysaccharides from numerous plant resources, like epimedium leaves 
 <xref rid="b0200" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, wheat brans 
 <xref rid="b0880" ref-type="bibr">[176]</xref>, pumpkin 
 <xref rid="b0910" ref-type="bibr">[182]</xref>, blackcurrant 
 <xref rid="b0925" ref-type="bibr">[185]</xref> and Ginkgo biloba clears out 
 <xref rid="b0940" ref-type="bibr">[188]</xref>, in which UAEE has illustrated its capacity to boost production. Wu et al. 
 <xref rid="b0910" ref-type="bibr">[182]</xref> found out that with EAE and UAEE on the recovery of pumpkin polysaccharides. The investigation demonstrated that when enzymes and ultrasound were utilized at the same time (ultrasonic illumination with dynamic proteins) or in the arrangement (ultrasonic light with inert enzymes) for sample, superior recovery of polysaccharides was accomplished in comparison to only EAE and traditional water extraction method or only using UAE. Collectively with the best polysaccharide production around 4.33 ± 0.15 percent were obtained through synchronous UAEE handle. Moreover, to remove arabinoxylan from wheat bran, Wang et al. 
 <xref rid="b0880" ref-type="bibr">[176]</xref> utilized EAE with UAE in the sequential arrangement. Building on ultrasound enhanced viability in enzyme treated with UAEE delivered high extracted yields (14.26 ± 0.17%) of arabinoxylan by wheat bran correlating to either EAE or UAE only, they found out. Amiri-Rigi et al. 
 <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> utilized UAEE to extract lycopene from residues of tomatoes within the tomato industry- Tchabo et al. 
 <xref rid="b0840" ref-type="bibr">[168]</xref> inspected impact of UAE and EAE for extracting phytochemical component (flavonoid, phenolic, anthocyanin, etc.). In this study, extraction is performed using UAE in combination with EAE and after that application of micro-emulsification extraction in tomatoes residue brought about improved partition in lycopenes when UAEE method is employed. A better extraction and productivity was observed using final products of phyto-bioactive mulberry components in UAEE extracted samples in comparison for UAE, EAE or conventional extracted procedures. They observed an increment using final products of phyto-bioactived mulberry components with better productivity in UAEE extracted in comparison for UAE, EAE or conventional extracted procedures. Amigh and Dinani 
 <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> performed an enzymatic treatment to recover oil from date seeds. To enhance the extraction performance of oil from date seeds, these same authors applied the simultaneous combination of ultrasound and enzymes. The results showed that strategy allows increasing the extraction yield of oil by using the sample to solvent ratio of 1:3 in comparison to the treatment using only enzymes. Similarly, the enzymatic extraction after ultrasonication pretreatment has also been reported for increasing the extracted oil contents from peanut seed powder

 <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> combined enzymatic treatment with ultrasound treatment for extraction of juice from banana pulp and observed that juice yield increased while viscosity of the juice decreased. The total soluble solids and clarity of the juice obtained by the combined treatment was also higher.
