<p id="p0270">The Azure B adsorption percentage onto CNTs/Zn:ZnO@Ni2P-NCs at various ultrasound time (2–10 min) was investigated from aqueous solution 
 <xref rid="b0290" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref> and observed that 98.84% Azure B adsorption were achieved at 8.2 min sonication time using 0.031 g of CNTs/Zn:ZnO@Ni2P-NCs, 26.1 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup> initial Az-B concentration, and pH 6.3. Dil et al., 
 <xref rid="b0280" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, studied the effect of ultrasound-assisted dispersive SPME for the determination of Methyl Green (MG) and Rose Bengal (RB) dyes in water and industrial wastewater in silverzinc oxide nanoparticles loaded on activated carbon (Ag-ZnO-NP-AC). The result showed that 3.3 min ultra-sonication recovers 99.37 and 99.27% of MG and RB, respectively at pH 6.7, 1.6 mg of Ag-ZnONP-AC mass, 3.3 min of ultrasonication time and 160 μL of DMF. Similar study was done by Asfaram et al., 
 <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> for the detection of Allura Red (AR) in fruit juice and water samples using ultrasound assisted dispersive SPME, and for detection of quercetin in
