 <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> found that ultrasounds as pretreatment before Soxhlet of peanut oil has been observed with 51.50% extraction yield in 10 min along with slight changes in fatty acid composition i.e. reduction of oleic acid content from 57.10% to 56.69% after 30 min. Futhermore, the combined study of ultrasound and Soxhlet method has been developed to take benefits of both techniques by reducing the number of Soxhlet cycles, the processing time, temperature, and solvent consumption

 <xref rid="b0540" ref-type="bibr">[108]</xref> have created unique Sono-Soxhlet procedures. Ultrasound is presented into the exterior or inside of the extraction chamber to extend the extraction of solid material and the transport of compounds from the solid matrix to solvent. Sono-Soxhlet consolidates the benefits of extraction performed with Soxhlet (same extraction by a new dissolvable) and boosts ultrasound mass exchange (diminishing of extraction time). The strategy makes sure that the specimen is collected completely, effortlessly and precisely. This strategy was moreover utilized for extricating the oil content and the fatty acid (FA) composition of oleaginous beans, wiener lipids, cheese fat and pastry shop items.
