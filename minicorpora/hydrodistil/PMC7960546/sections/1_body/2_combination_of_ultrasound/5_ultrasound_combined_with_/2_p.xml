<p id="p0170">Supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) is a comparatively new technology for extraction depending upon the rise in solvation power of fluids (above their critical point). This results in extraction due to the combined effect of gas-like properties (mass transfer) and liquid-like properties (solvation) with diffusivity more than that of liquids

 <sub>2</sub> based due to user-friendly profile and higher extraction potential along with its inexpensive nature. SFE's major benefits incorporate pre-concentration impacts, cleanliness with the assurance of higher yields, and simple operating procedure.
