<p id="p0175">Liu et al. 
 <xref rid="b0515" ref-type="bibr">[103]</xref> showed promising results to obtain iberis amara seed oil using ultrasound pretreatment combined with supercritical CO
 <sub>2</sub> extraction. And result shows that combined treatment yield more than 25% oil as well as improves physiochemical properties and antioxidant activity of oil when compared with supercritical CO
 <sub>2</sub> extracted oil. Additionally, Gomez-Gomez et al. 
 <xref rid="b0370" ref-type="bibr">[74]</xref>, studied the effect of supercritical CO
 <sub>2</sub> with high pressure ultrasound on the inactivation of more resistant microorganisms such as gram-positive bacteria or moulds as well as stability of the lipid emulsions. Castillo-zamudio et al. 
 <xref rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, also observed that when the supercritical CO
 <sub>2</sub> treatment combined with high pressure ultrasound were effective for inactivation of E. coli microbes and extend the shelf-life of dry cured ham. Supercritical fluid extraction has certain disadvantages like higher expenses to be incurred on equipment, and the complexity of separating polar components without the aid of CO
 <sub>2</sub> modifiers. Ultrasound also allows a wide range of compounds to be extracted using polar or non-polar solvents and much simpler equipment. The ultrasound treatment enhances the mass-flow of the target components from the solid phase to the extracting media
