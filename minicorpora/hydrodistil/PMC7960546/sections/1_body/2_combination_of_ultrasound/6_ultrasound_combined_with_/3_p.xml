<p id="p0185">According to Zhang et al. 
 <xref rid="b0955" ref-type="bibr">[191]</xref>, ultrasound was used as pretreatment as chemical free method to pretreat rice hull and enhance enzymatic hydrolysis for the production of fermentable sugars. Similar, study also conducted by Yang et al. 
 <xref rid="b0930" ref-type="bibr">[186]</xref>, and observed that ultrasound pretreatment yield 38.2% higher reducing sugar (381.59 mg/g rice hull) from pretreated rice hull compared to only by extrusion (276.11 mg/g rice hull). Some researcher also reported that ultrasound assisted extrusion technology had been used to improves the dispersion of nanoparticles in the polymer matrix
