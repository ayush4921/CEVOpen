<p id="p0240">When it is forced to fluid material, the high-intensity ultrasound actuates production of heat. In this manner, ultrasound applications are planned as an HHP pre-treatment that has been designed at 5–8 °C processing temperature, and the temperature fluctuations should be kept minimal due to ultrasound treatment. Apart from this, ultrasound treatment, in combination with high-pressure treatment, ought to cause a reduction in microbial activity. It is reported that the ultrasound-high pressure treatment (US-HPP) has insignificant impacts on the nutritional quality and taste of food.</p>
