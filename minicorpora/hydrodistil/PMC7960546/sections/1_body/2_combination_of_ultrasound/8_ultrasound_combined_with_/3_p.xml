<p id="p0205">With the development of a flavour and scent processing units and the expanding request for more natural items, the need for modern strategies of extraction has gone up. The combination of ultrasound with Clevenger or alembic refining has in recent times pulled in expanding interest. This drive to the creation of Sono-Clevenger 
 <xref rid="b0675" ref-type="bibr">[135]</xref> pointed specifically at extricating essential oils from plant materials. Sono-Clevenger is a starting combination of ultrasonic cavitation at ambient or diminished pressure and Clevenger refining. It points to provide comparable yields to those gotten through conventional hydrodistillation in any case with diminished extraction times and enhanced yields. Unlike customary Clevenger refining, the thermally delicate crude materials are preserved with this technique. The findings of this study are summarised in that ultrasonic extraction under optimum conditions had a significant impact at an energy, economic and environmental level, increasing the viability of the oil and fat industry in contrast to the conventional process.
