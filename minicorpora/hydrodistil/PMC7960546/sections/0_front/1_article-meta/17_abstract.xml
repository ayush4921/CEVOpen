 <p>The use of non-thermal processing technologies has been on the surge due to ever increasing demand for highest quality convenient foods containing the natural taste &amp; flavor and being free of chemical additives and preservatives. Among the various non-thermal processing methods, ultrasound technology has proven to be very valuable. Ultrasound processing, being used alone or in combination with other processing methods, yields significant positive results on the quality of foods, thus has been considered efficacious. Food processes performed under the action of ultrasound are believed to be affected in part by cavitation phenomenon and mass transfer enhancement. It is considered to be an emerging and promising technology and has been applied efficiently in food processing industry for several processes such as freezing, filtration, drying, separation, emulsion, sterilization, and extraction. Various researches have opined that ultrasound leads to an increase in the performance of the process and improves the quality factors of the food. The present paper will discuss the mechanical, chemical and biochemical effects produced by the propagation of high intensity ultrasonic waves through the medium. This review outlines the current knowledge about application of ultrasound in food technology including processing, preservation and extraction. In addition, the several advantages of ultrasound processing, which when combined with other different technologies (such as microwave, supercritical CO
  <sub>2</sub>, high pressure processing, enzymatic extraction, etc.) are being examined. These include an array of effects such as effective mixing, retention of food characteristics, faster energy and mass transfer, reduced thermal and concentration gradients, effective extraction, increased production, and efficient alternative to conventional techniques. Furthermore, the paper presents the necessary theoretical background and details of the technology, technique, and safety precautions about ultrasound.
