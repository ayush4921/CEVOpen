 <p>The phytochemical diversity of 
  <italic>Melittis melissophyllum</italic> was investigated in terms of seasonal changes and age of plants including plant organs diversity. The content of phenolics, namely: coumarin; 3,4-dihydroxycoumarin; 
  <italic>o</italic>-coumaric acid 2-
  <italic>O</italic>-glucoside; verbascoside; apiin; luteolin-7-
  <italic>O</italic>-glucoside; and 
  <italic>o</italic>-coumaric; 
  <italic>p</italic>-coumaric; chlorogenic; caffeic; ferulic; cichoric acids, was determined using HPLC-DAD. Among these, luteolin-7-
  <italic>O</italic>-glucoside, verbascoside, chlorogenic acid, and coumarin were the dominants. The highest content of flavonoids and phenolic acids was observed in 2-year-old plants, while coumarin in 4-year-old plants (272.06 mg 100 g
  <sup>–1</sup> DW). When considering seasonal changes, the highest content of luteolin-7-
  <italic>O</italic>-glucoside was observed at the full flowering, whereas verbascoside and chlorogenic acid were observed at the seed-setting stage. Among plant organs, the content of coumarin and phenolic acids was the highest in leaves, whereas verbascoside and luteolin-7-
  <italic>O</italic>-glucoside were observed in flowers. The composition of essential oil was determined using GC-MS/GC-FID. In the essential oil from leaves, the dominant was 1-octen-3-ol, whilst from flowers, the dominant was α-pinene.
