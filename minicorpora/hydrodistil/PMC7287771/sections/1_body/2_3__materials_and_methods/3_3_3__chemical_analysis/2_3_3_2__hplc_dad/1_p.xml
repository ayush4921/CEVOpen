<p>Extraction of the raw material was carried out using Büchi Labortechnik AG Extraction System B-811 (Flawil, Switzerland). Briefly, 1.000 g of air-dried, finely powdered raw material was extracted with 100 mL of methanol. Soxhlet hot extraction with 25 cycles, flushing, and drying was applied. After evaporation of solvent, the residue was dissolved in 10 mL of methanol. The extracts were filtered with Supelco Iso-Disc
 <sup>TM</sup> Syringe Tip Filter Unit, PTFE membrane (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) and subjected to HPLC analysis. The analysis was performed using a Shimadzu chromatograph, equipped with an auto-sampler SIL-20A, photodiode array detector SPD-M10A VP PDA, and CLASS VP™ 7.3 chromatography software (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Separations were achieved by using a C18 reverse-phase Kinetex
 <sup>™</sup> column, 2.6 μm, 100 mm × 4.60 mm, with a porous outer layer on solid silica core particles (Phenomenex
 <sup>®</sup>, Torrance, CA, USA). Validation parameters has already been described in detail by Szymborska-Sandhu et al. [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-25-02421" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Quantification of the analyzed compounds was performed with analytical wavelength appropriate for each compound: (1) coumarin, 3,4-dihydroxycoumarin, 
 <italic>o</italic>-coumaric, acid and 
 <italic>o</italic>-coumaric acid 2-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucoside were quantified at 276 nm; (2) 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid was quantified at 309 nm; (3) chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, cichoric acid were quantified at 325 nm; (4) verbascoside was quantified at 330 nm; (5) apiin was quantified at 336 nm; (6) luteolin-7-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucoside was quantified at 347 nm. Standard curve parameters were calculated with Microsoft Excel.
