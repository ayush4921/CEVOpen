0: Extraction of the raw material was carried out using Buchi Labortechnik AG Extraction System B-811 (Flawil, Switzerland).
1: Briefly, 1.000 g of air-dried, finely powdered raw material was extracted with 100 mL of methanol.
2: Soxhlet hot extraction with 25 cycles, flushing, and drying was applied.
3: After evaporation of solvent, the residue was dissolved in 10 mL of methanol.
4: The extracts were filtered with Supelco Iso-Disc TM Syringe Tip Filter Unit, PTFE membrane (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) and subjected to HPLC analysis.
5: The analysis was performed using a Shimadzu chromatograph, equipped with an auto-sampler SIL-20A, photodiode array detector SPD-M10A VP PDA, and CLASS VPTM 7.3 chromatography software (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan).
6: Separations were achieved by using a C18 reverse-phase Kinetex TM column, 2.6 m, 100 mm  4.60 mm, with a porous outer layer on solid silica core particles (Phenomenex , Torrance, CA, USA).
7: Validation parameters has already been described in detail by Szymborska-Sandhu et al.
8: [ 21].
9: Quantification of the analyzed compounds was performed with analytical wavelength appropriate for each compound: (1) coumarin, 3,4-dihydroxycoumarin,  o-coumaric, acid and  o-coumaric acid 2- O-glucoside were quantified at 276 nm; (2)  p-coumaric acid was quantified at 309 nm; (3) chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, cichoric acid were quantified at 325 nm; (4) verbascoside was quantified at 330 nm; (5) apiin was quantified at 336 nm; (6) luteolin-7- O-glucoside was quantified at 347 nm.
10: Standard curve parameters were calculated with Microsoft Excel.
