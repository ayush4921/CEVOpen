 <xref rid="B39-molecules-25-02421" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Briefly, 20 g of air-dried raw material was subjected to hydrodistillation in a Clevenger-type apparatus for 3 h. Qualitative GC-MS and quantitative GC-FID analysis of the essential oils obtained from flowers and leaves were performed by usage an Agilent Technologies 7890A gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and MS Agilent Technologies 5975C Inert XL_MSD with Triple Axis Detector (Agilent Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA). Capillary, polar column HP 20M (25 m × 0.32 mm × 0.3 µm film thickness) (Agilent Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA) was applied. Detailed procedure, including separation conditions and identification of compounds was conducted as described earlier by Bączek et al. [
