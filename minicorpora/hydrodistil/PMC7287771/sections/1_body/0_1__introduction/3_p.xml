<p>The content of biologically active compounds changes in plants depending on their age, developmental stage, and plant organ. This is also determined by the species and environmental factors influencing the growth of the plant [

 <xref rid="B16-molecules-25-02421" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Therefore, it is important to consider these factors when regards the quality of plantsâ€™ raw materials used in the food and cosmetics industries. Some aspects of this phenomenon, concerning seasonal changes of some phenolic compounds in

 <xref rid="B13-molecules-25-02421" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, these data are fragmented and are related only to the wild-growing plants. Strict ex situ works aiming to determine the chemical diversity of the raw material depending on the age of the plants and their developmental phase have not been conducted so far.
