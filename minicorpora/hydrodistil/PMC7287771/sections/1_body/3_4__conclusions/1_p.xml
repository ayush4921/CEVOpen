<p>According to the requirements of the phytopharmaceutical and food industries, the quality of herbal raw materials is strictly associated with the high and stable content of secondary metabolites influencing the biological activity of these materials. Such quality standards are very hard to be met, especially in the case of wild-growing plants that are collected from the genetically unstable populations, from plants of different ages, that grow in diverse environments. In this study, some factors influencing the accumulation of phenolic compounds in the raw materials of 
 <italic>M. melissophyllum</italic>, were investigated. The results showed that both the age and the developmental stage of the plants strongly influence the content of phenolic compounds in 
 <italic>M. melissophyllum</italic> herb. The differences in the content and composition of biologically active compounds among plant organs were also significant. Thus, these factors should be taken into consideration in plant production. Our results may be useful not only in the identification of quality markers of these raw materials but also in the works concerning the introduction of the plant into cultivation, including the selection of uniform lines that may be used in industries.
