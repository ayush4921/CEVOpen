<p>Essential oils are another group of compounds important when regards the quality of herbal raw materials of 
 <italic>M. melissophyllum</italic>, although their content in this plant is relatively low. According to our study, the content of essential oil in its leaves was higher than in flowers (0.09 and 0.03 g 100 g
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively). The GC-MS analysis showed that the composition of essential oils distilled from these organs was significantly different. The dominant compound in the leaves was 1-octen-3-ol, while in the flowers it was α-pinene. In total, 22 compounds were identified in flowers and 27– in the essential oil obtained from leaves, which accounted for 95.63 and 90.98%, respectively, of the total identified substances (

 <italic>M. melissophyllum</italic> herb. It is worth noting that coumarin might be a component of the essential oils, too. The chemical composition of volatiles present in the dried leaves, stems, calyx, and corolla of 
 <italic>M. melissophyllum</italic> was previously investigated by Maggi et al. [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-25-02421" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. According to their results, the emission of volatiles from leaves was over thrice higher than that of other organs, and the dominant compound, i.e., 1-octen-3-ol was similar in quantities in the leaves, stems, and calyx. However, it was not detected in corolla. It was observed that 1-octen-3-ol is present in plant raw materials in low concentrations; the compound is formed in higher quantities only during hydrodistillation [

Our study, carried out on essential oils distilled from dried raw materials, have shown that 1-octen-3-ol as a dominant compound of essential oil from leaves (29.19%), was present in essential oil from flowers, too (1.04%). Flowers predominantly contained α-pinene (66.58%). The percentage share of coumarin in the essential oil of leaves was relatively low (1.17%), whereas in the essential oil from flowers the compound was not detected (

 <italic>M. melissophyllum</italic> herb, it is nowadays used to aromatize alcohol and tobacco products, and is considered as an interesting source of mushroom-like odor for the food industry.
