 <italic>M. melissophyllum</italic> roots may be associated with the mechanisms of plant adaptation and defense. It is well known, that plant roots interact with a diverse community of microorganisms and neighboring plants which affects different processes in the soil, including tissue decomposition and soil respiration. Roots secrete various phenolic compounds, which serve as a nutrient or acts as a toxin to those organisms [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-25-02421" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. They control nitrogen availability and are responsible for shifting the composition of the microbial community [

 <italic>p</italic>-hydroxybenzoic, caffeic acids, and coumarin, along with some flavonoids, namely: catechin, naringenin, and quercetin [
