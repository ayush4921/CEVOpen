<p>Plant diversity may be considered at the level of plant organs obtained as raw materials. Thus, in this study, flowers, leaves, shoots, and roots of 
 <italic>M. melissophyllum</italic> were subjected to chemical analyzes. According to our results, the level of luteolin-7-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucoside, the dominant flavonoid, was similar in both flowers and leaves (1480.78 and 1441.36 mg 100 g
 <sup>–1</sup> DW, respectively). In the shoots, its content was distinctly lower (20.37 mg 100 g
 <sup>–1</sup> DW), whereas in the roots it was absent. The content of verbascoside was the highest in flowers (576.96 mg 100 g
 <sup>–1</sup> DW), while apiin– in the leaves (134.30 mg 100 g
 <sup>–1</sup> DW). Moreover, apiin was not detected in both shoots and roots, while roots demonstrated a distinct quantity of verbascoside (

 <xref rid="B29-molecules-25-02421" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], flavonoids are not only accumulated in the cells in which they are synthesized but may also translocate to other plant organs. As previously mentioned, flavonoids are implicated in the control of auxin transport. Thus, their presence in 
 <italic>M. melissophyllum</italic> roots may be combined with auxin-dependent physiological processes taking place in the plants.
