<p>To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies regarding the relationship between the age of 
 <italic>M. melissophyllum</italic> and the quality of its herb. In our experiment plant material (herb) was collected during four successive years of plant vegetation, at full flowering stage. According to our results, there were significant differences between plants of different ages with respect to the accumulation of the analyzed compounds. The flavonoids were detected in their highest quantities in 2-year-old plants and were distinctly lower in 3- and 4-year-old plants. The differences were especially visible for apiin and luteolin-7-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucoside. Similar results were obtained for the majority of the analyzed phenolic acids, i.e., chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, cichoric acid, as well as 3,4-dihydroxycoumarin and 
 <italic>o</italic>-coumaric acid 2-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucoside (

 <italic>M. melissophyllum</italic> produces only 1â€“2 shoots and practically does not enter the generative phase. However, during this time, its underground organs intensively expand and in the next year (second year of vegetation), the plant produced numerous flowering shoots. The transition from vegetative to flowering phase is a crucial developmental stage influencing the reproductive success of the species. Thus, at this particular stage some species modulates their chemical profile to produce specific molecules regulating reproduction, growth, or used in defense against biotic and abiotic factors [
