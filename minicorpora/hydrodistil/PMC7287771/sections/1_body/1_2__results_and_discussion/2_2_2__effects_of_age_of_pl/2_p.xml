<p>In this study, unlike most of the investigated compounds, the content of coumarin increased with the age of the plants and reached its maximum in 4-year-old plants (

Coumarin is reported to play an important role in inter-species competition, inhibiting seed germination. Some coumarin compounds regulate the level of chlorophyll content and thus regulate plant senescence [
