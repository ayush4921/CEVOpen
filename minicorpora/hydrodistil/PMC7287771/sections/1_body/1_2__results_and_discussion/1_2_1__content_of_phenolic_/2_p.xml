<p>When regards chemical changes during the ontogenic development of 
 <italic>M. melissophyllum</italic>, coumarins, and phenolic acids were investigated, too. Among these, special attention was paid to the content of coumarin which is responsible for the specific, sweet aroma of the herb. The content of this compound was similar at the beginning of flowering and at the full flowering stage, and then distinctly decreased at the seed-setting stage. A similar tendency was also observed for 
 <italic>o</italic>-coumaric and 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acids; however, their content was significantly lower. The concentration of 
 <italic>o</italic>-coumaric acid 2-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucoside decreased from the beginning of flowering until the seed-setting stage. Furthermore, the content of 3,4-dihydroxycoumarin, as well as caffeic acid and cichoric acid, was the highest at full flowering stage, whereas the level of chlorogenic acid, the dominant among phenolic acids, was the highest at the beginning of the seed-setting stage (

 <italic>M. melissophyllum</italic> have been investigated earlier. According to Maggi et al. [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-25-02421" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], the content of coumarin in this raw material was the highest at the early stage of plant development, during intensive vegetative growth, and then decreased. Similar results were observed in this study, where the content of coumarin gradually decreased during observed growth of the plants (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-02421-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Higher concentration of this compound at the beginning of vegetation and during flowering, when intensively growing plants are more susceptible to pathogens, is combined with its antipathogenic role [

 <xref rid="B20-molecules-25-02421" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] the content of this compound in 
 <italic>Mikania laevigata,</italic> an undergrowth species, which similarly to 
 <italic>M. melissophyllum</italic> grows in forests, is affected not only by the developmental stage of the plant but also by the shade level. This was well-documented in our previous investigations on 
 <italic>M. melissopyllum</italic>. The plants grown in moderate (30%) shade were found to thrive best; however, the content of coumarin in the herb was the highest in deep (50%) shade, compared to full sunlight and 30% shade [
