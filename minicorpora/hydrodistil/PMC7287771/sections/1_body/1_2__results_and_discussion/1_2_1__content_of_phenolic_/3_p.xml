<p>Changes in the content of some phenolic acids in 
 <italic>M. melissophyllum</italic> have been studied earlier in situ by Skrzypczak-Pietraszek and Pietraszek [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-25-02421" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. According to their results, protocatechuic acid, chlorogenic acid, 
 <italic>p</italic>-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, caffeic acid, syringic acid, 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, sinapic acid, 
 <italic>o</italic>-coumaric acid, and cinnamic acid were observed in higher concentration at the end of plant vegetation than at flowering stage. This, probably, was related not only to seasonal changes, but also to the age of the wild-growing plants and the environmental condition in which they grew. In our study, carried out on plants at the same age, the differences in the accumulation of phenolic acids during plant vegetation were more diverse. The dominant phenolic acid, i.e., chlorogenic acid, was observed at the highest concentration at the beginning of the seed-setting stage, whereas the content of cichoric acid was the highest at the full flowering stage (

 <italic>Stachys officinalis</italic> L. [

 <xref rid="molecules-25-02421-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Previously, it has been reported, that some phenolic acids may affect the phosphorous (P) uptake of plants, and thus, influence the processes associated with flowering [

In general, these compounds are considered to be biotic and/or abiotic stress-dependent molecules that are important for plantâ€™s adaptation and resistance to unfavorable environmental factors, floral induction, reproduction and senescence [
