<p>Among the analyzed compounds three flavonoids, i.e., verbascoside, apiin, and luteoline-7-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucoside were determined, with the latter as the dominant compound in this group. The content of luteolin-7-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucoside was the highest at the full flowering stage (1107.65 mg 100 g
 <sup>–1</sup> dry weight (DW)), while the highest concentration of verbascoside and apiin was observed at the beginning of the seed-setting stage (599.86 and 156.22 mg 100 g
 <sup>–1</sup> DW, respectively). The lowest level of all three flavonoids was detected at the beginning of the flowering stage (

Such a high content of above-mentioned flavonoids at full flowering and at the seed-setting stage might be related to the role of these compounds during a particular stage of development of the plants. It was reported that flavonoids are responsible for the transport of auxins in plants at both intra- and intercellular levels, and thus are responsible for the formation of new organs and the development of the whole plant. In addition, it was also shown that most perennial plants require flavonoids in order to set fertile seeds [

 <italic>M. melissophyllum</italic>, during flowering and seed formation, may be associated with this phenomenon. Moreover, flavonoids are one of the most effective UV-B absorbents, serving an important role in the protection of DNA and photosynthetic systems in plants [

 <italic>M. melissophyllum</italic>, whose development is closely related to the access of sunlight and the quality of light. Some flavonoids, e.g., luteolin glycosides, are also capable of effectively chelating Fe or Cu-ions and thus prevent the formation of reactive oxygen species or to reduce their level [

 <xref rid="B19-molecules-25-02421" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. High content of flavonoids during the flowering stage has been previously reported for many species. For this reason, the flowering stage is considered as the most appropriate one for the harvest of the herb of most of the medicinal and aromatic plants in agricultural practice.
