<p>In order to assess the potential detrimental impact of the 
 <italic>Conyza</italic> essential oils on beneficial aquatic species, the insecticidal activity was assessed against the water bug, 
 <italic>Diplonychus rusticus</italic>, an insect predator of mosquito larvae [
 <xref rid="B66-molecules-25-04576" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Both 
 <italic>C. canadensis</italic> and 
 <italic>C. sumatrensis</italic> essential oils were substantially less toxic to 
 <italic>D. rusticus</italic> than they were to the mosquito larvae.
