<p>The essential oils from the aerial parts of 
 <italic>C. bonariensis</italic>, 
 <italic>C. canadensis</italic>, and 
 <italic>C. sumatrensis</italic> were obtained by hydrodistillation in 1.10%, 1.37%, and 1.21% yield. The chemical compositions of the 
 <italic>Conyza</italic> essential oils, determined using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry, are summarized in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04576-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. 
 <italic>Conyza bonariensis</italic> essential oil was dominated by sesquiterpenoids, especially 
 <italic>allo</italic>-aromadendrene (41.2%), β-caryophyllene (13.3%), and caryophyllene oxide (12.2%). Concentrations of monoterpenoids (1.8%) and diterpenoids (trace) were relatively small. The essential oils of 
 <italic>C. canadensis</italic> and 
 <italic>C. sumatrensis</italic>, on the other hand, were rich in limonene (41.5% and 25.5%, respectively). The aerial parts essential oil of 
 <italic>C. sumatrensis</italic> also had a large concentration of (
 <italic>Z</italic>)-lachnophyllum ester (20.7%). There is wide variation in the essential oil compositions of 
 <italic>Conyza</italic> species, both between species and within the same species (see 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04576-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). This is not surprising given the very different geographical locations of the collection sites for these samples.
