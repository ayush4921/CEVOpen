<p>Invasive plant species are generally considered to be ecologically and detrimental with potential economic impacts, and the control or eradication of invasive plant species can be prohibitively costly. However, identification of beneficial uses of invasive plants could be economically advantageous and aid in the control of the species.

 <italic>Severinia monophylla</italic> [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-25-04576" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], are invasive weeds in Vietnam, and essential oils from these plants have demonstrated promising mosquito larvicidal activities. The plant materials are readily available and harvesting of these weeds may provide economically valuable “cash crops” as well as serve as a means for ecological remediation. Note that 
 <italic>C. bonariensis</italic> [

 <italic>C. canadensis</italic> [

 <italic>C. sumatrensis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B71-molecules-25-04576" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] have all shown resistance to the commonly used herbicide glyphosate, so herbicidal control of these weeds is impractical as well as environmentally detrimental. Further research on potential formulations (e.g., nanoemulsions or essential oil-loaded nanoparticles) [
