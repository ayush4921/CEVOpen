<p>Mosquito larvicidal activity was carried out on 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> as previously described [
 <xref rid="B67-molecules-25-04576" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]: For the assay, 1% stock solutions of each essential oil in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) were prepared, and aliquots of the stock solutions were placed in 500-mL beakers and added to water that contained 20 larvae (fourth instar). With each experiment, a set of controls using DMSO was also run for comparison. Mortality was recorded after 24 h and again after 48 h of exposure during which no nutritional supplement was added. The experiments were carried out 25 ± 2°C. Each test was conducted with four replicates with three concentrations (50, 25, and 12.5, μg/mL for 
 <italic>C. canadensis</italic> and 
 <italic>C. sumatrensis</italic>; 150, 100, and 50 μg/mL for 
 <italic>C. bonariensis</italic>). Permethrin was used as a positive control.
