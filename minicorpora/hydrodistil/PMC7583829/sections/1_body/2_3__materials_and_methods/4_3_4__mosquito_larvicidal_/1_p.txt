0: Mosquito larvicidal activity was carried out on  Ae.
1: aegypti,  Ae.
2: albopictus, and  Cx.
3: quinquefasciatus as previously described [ 67]: For the assay, 1% stock solutions of each essential oil in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) were prepared, and aliquots of the stock solutions were placed in 500-mL beakers and added to water that contained 20 larvae (fourth instar).
4: With each experiment, a set of controls using DMSO was also run for comparison.
5: Mortality was recorded after 24 h and again after 48 h of exposure during which no nutritional supplement was added.
6: The experiments were carried out 25  2C.
7: Each test was conducted with four replicates with three concentrations (50, 25, and 12.5, g/mL for  C. canadensis and  C. sumatrensis; 150, 100, and 50 g/mL for  C. bonariensis).
8: Permethrin was used as a positive control.
