0: The  Conyza essential oils were analyzed by GC-MS as previously described [ 67]: Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010 Ultra, electron impact (EI) mode, electron energy = 70 eV, scan range = 40400 atomic mass units, scan rate = 3.0 scans/s, ZB-5 fused silica capillary column (30 m  0.25 mm, 0.25 m film thickness), He carrier gas, 552 kPa column head pressure, and 1.37 mL/min flow rate.
1: Injector temperature was 250 C and the ion source temperature was 200 C. The GC oven temperature program was programmed for 50 C initial temperature, temperature increased at a rate of 2 C/min to 260 C. A 5%  w/ v solution of the sample in CH 2Cl 2 was prepared and 0.1 L was injected with a splitting mode (30:1).
2: Identification of the oil components was based on their retention indices determined by reference to a homologous series of  n-alkanes, and by comparison of their mass spectral fragmentation patterns with those reported in the databases [ 36, 37, 38, 39].
