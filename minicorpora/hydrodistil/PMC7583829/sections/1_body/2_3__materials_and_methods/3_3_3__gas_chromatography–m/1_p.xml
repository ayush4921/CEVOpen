 <xref rid="B67-molecules-25-04576" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]: Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010 Ultra, electron impact (EI) mode, electron energy = 70 eV, scan range = 40–400 atomic mass units, scan rate = 3.0 scans/s, ZB-5 fused silica capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm film thickness), He carrier gas, 552 kPa column head pressure, and 1.37 mL/min flow rate. Injector temperature was 250 °C and the ion source temperature was 200 °C. The GC oven temperature program was programmed for 50 °C initial temperature, temperature increased at a rate of 2 °C/min to 260 °C. A 5%
