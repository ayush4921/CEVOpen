<p>The mortalities were recorded 24 h and 48 h after treatment. The data obtained were subjected to log-probit analysis [
 <xref rid="B68-molecules-25-04576" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] to obtain LC
 <sub>50</sub> values, LC
 <sub>90</sub> values, 95% confidence limits, and chi square values using Minitab
 <sup>®</sup> 18 (Minitab Inc., State College, PA, USA). For the principal component analysis (PCA), the 9 major components (limonene,

 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> were taken as variables using a Pearson correlation matrix using XLSTAT Premium, version 2018.5 (Addinsoft, Paris, France). A total of 33 data (11 variables × 3 samples) were used for the PCA.
