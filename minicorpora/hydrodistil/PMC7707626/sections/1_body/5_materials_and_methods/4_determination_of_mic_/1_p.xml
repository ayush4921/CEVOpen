<p>The macro broth dilution method was used to determine the MIC value of SKEO against MDR isolates. To dissolve SKEO, 100 μg/mL DMSO solvent was added to SKEO concentrations of 100, 120, 140, 160, 180, 200, 220, and 240 μg in eight sterile glass tubes (13×100 mm). Each tube was filled with 1 mL of Muller-Hinton broth and isolates were inoculated into tubes. After mixing, 1 mL of bacterial suspension (106 CFU/mL) was added to each tube and the final concentration of 5×105 CFU/mL was obtained. After incubation at 37 ºC for 24 hours, the minimal concentration of SKEO inhibiting bacterial growth was defined as MIC.
