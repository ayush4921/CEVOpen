0: The macro broth dilution method was used to determine the MIC value of SKEO against MDR isolates.
1: To dissolve SKEO, 100 g/mL DMSO solvent was added to SKEO concentrations of 100, 120, 140, 160, 180, 200, 220, and 240 g in eight sterile glass tubes (13100 mm).
2: Each tube was filled with 1 mL of Muller-Hinton broth and isolates were inoculated into tubes.
3: After mixing, 1 mL of bacterial suspension (106 CFU/mL) was added to each tube and the final concentration of 5105 CFU/mL was obtained.
4: After incubation at 37 oC for 24 hours, the minimal concentration of SKEO inhibiting bacterial growth was defined as MIC.
5: 16
