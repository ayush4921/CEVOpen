<p>The changes in the expression level of 
 <italic>mexE</italic> and 
 <italic>mexY</italic> genes before and after being subjected to SKEO were identified through cDNA amplification using the qPCR method. Real-time PCR was performed using the Corbett Palm-Cycler gradient thermal cycler (Qiagen, Germany) under the following conditions: 12.5 μL of Maxima SYBR Green/ROX qPCR Master Mix 2X (Fermentas, USA), 2 μL of template, and 0.3 pmol of each primer (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). Amplification of all genes was carried out with one cycle pre-denaturation at 95 °C for 10 minutes, 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 20 seconds, annealing at 58 °C for 20 seconds, and elongation at 72 °C for 20 seconds, followed by a final step at 72 °C for 60 seconds. Melting curve analysis was drawn at the terminal of the 40
 <sup>th</sup> cycle between 58-95 °C. Moreover, the Livak method was used to determine relative changes in the expression of 
 <italic>mexE</italic> and 
 <italic>mexY</italic> genes in comparison with the housekeeping genes.
