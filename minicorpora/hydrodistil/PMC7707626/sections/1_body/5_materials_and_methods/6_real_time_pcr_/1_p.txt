0: The changes in the expression level of  mexE and  mexY genes before and after being subjected to SKEO were identified through cDNA amplification using the qPCR method.
1: Real-time PCR was performed using the Corbett Palm-Cycler gradient thermal cycler (Qiagen, Germany) under the following conditions: 12.5 L of Maxima SYBR Green/ROX qPCR Master Mix 2X (Fermentas, USA), 2 L of template, and 0.3 pmol of each primer ( table 1).
2: Amplification of all genes was carried out with one cycle pre-denaturation at 95 C for 10 minutes, 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 C for 20 seconds, annealing at 58 C for 20 seconds, and elongation at 72 C for 20 seconds, followed by a final step at 72 C for 60 seconds.
3: Melting curve analysis was drawn at the terminal of the 40 th cycle between 58-95 C. Moreover, the Livak method was used to determine relative changes in the expression of  mexE and  mexY genes in comparison with the housekeeping genes.
