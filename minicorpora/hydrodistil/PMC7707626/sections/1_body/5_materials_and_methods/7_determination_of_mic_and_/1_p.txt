0: The MIC values of gentamicin (MAST, England) and norfloxacin (MAST, England) in the absence and presence of SKEO were characterized using macro broth dilution and checkerboard assays.
1: To assess the synergistic effects of SKEO, two-fold serial dilutions of gentamicin and norfloxacin were prepared and added into a 96-well microtitre plate.
2: Dilutions for each antimicrobial agent ranged from 1.16 dilution to 2 sub-inhibitory concentrations.
3: The second agent (SKEO) was also serially diluted at different sub-inhibitory concentrations, and 50 L of each dilution was added into each well.
4: Then, 100 L of the bacterial suspension (10 6 CFU/mL) was added into the wells with a final volume of 200 L. Each experiment was controlled using solvent and growth sterility tests.
5: All tests were carried out in duplicate.
6: The microtiter plates were incubated at 37 C for 18 hours under aerobic conditions.
7: Then, 10 L from each well was poured on the Muller-Hinton agar, and the checkerboard synergy result was obtained by calculating the fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) with the following formula:  18
