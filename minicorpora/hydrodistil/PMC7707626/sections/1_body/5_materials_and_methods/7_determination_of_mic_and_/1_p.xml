<p>The MIC values of gentamicin (MAST, England) and norfloxacin (MAST, England) in the absence and presence of SKEO were characterized using macro broth dilution and checkerboard assays. To assess the synergistic effects of SKEO, two-fold serial dilutions of gentamicin and norfloxacin were prepared and added into a 96-well microtitre plate. Dilutions for each antimicrobial agent ranged from 1.16 dilution to 2 sub-inhibitory concentrations. The second agent (SKEO) was also serially diluted at different sub-inhibitory concentrations, and 50 μL of each dilution was added into each well. Then, 100 μL of the bacterial suspension (10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU/mL) was added into the wells with a final volume of 200 μL. Each experiment was controlled using solvent and growth sterility tests. All tests were carried out in duplicate. The microtiter plates were incubated at 37 °C for 18 hours under aerobic conditions. Then, 10 μL from each well was poured on the Muller-Hinton agar, and the checkerboard synergy result was obtained by calculating the fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) with the following formula:
