<p>Based on the method recommended by the European Pharmacopeia, dry aerial parts (100 g) of 
 <italic>S. khuzistanica</italic> were subjected to hydrodistillation for three hours using a Clevenger-type apparatus (Bakhtaran Co., Iran). The content of the device was kept at room temperature for 24 hours and subsequently mixed at the speed of 130 rpm using a shaker. A rotary device was used to remove solvents from the samples. Then, the sample was filtered using a vacuum pump. The obtained extract was weighed and then dissolved in dimethy sulfoxide (DMSO) solvent (Merck, Germany). The solution was kept in a refrigerator (Donar, Iran) at 4 Â°C for further use.
