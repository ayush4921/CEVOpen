<p>The RT-PCR reaction was performed using the RevertAid first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Fermentas, USA) in a total volume of 25 μL reaction mixture, including 1 µg of cDNA (10 mM) and 0.3 pmol of each primer (

The PCR condition included an initial denaturation at 95 °C for two minutes; 35 cycles at 95 °C for 30 seconds, 57 °C for 30 seconds, and 72 °C for 30 seconds; and a final extension at 72 °C for five minutes. GyrA was used as an internal control. PCR products were subjected to 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized under Ultraviolet (UV) light using the gel documentation system (Bio-Rad, Germany).
