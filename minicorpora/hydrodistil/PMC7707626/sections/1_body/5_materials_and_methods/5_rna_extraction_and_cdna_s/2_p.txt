0: The RT-PCR reaction was performed using the RevertAid first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Fermentas, USA) in a total volume of 25 L reaction mixture, including 1 g of cDNA (10 mM) and 0.3 pmol of each primer ( table 1).
1: The PCR condition included an initial denaturation at 95 C for two minutes; 35 cycles at 95 C for 30 seconds, 57 C for 30 seconds, and 72 C for 30 seconds; and a final extension at 72 C for five minutes.
2: GyrA was used as an internal control.
3: PCR products were subjected to 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized under Ultraviolet (UV) light using the gel documentation system (Bio-Rad, Germany).
