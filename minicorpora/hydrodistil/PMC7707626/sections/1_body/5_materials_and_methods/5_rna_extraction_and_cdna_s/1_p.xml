<p>A total of five MDR isolates were cultured in Muller-Hinton broth and suspended in diluted SKEO with a concentration below the MIC value and incubated at 37 ºC for 24 hours. The total RNA was extracted using an RNA extraction kit (Qiagen, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Then, cDNA was synthesized in a total volume of 20 μL reaction mixture, including 2 µg of the extracted RNA, 1 μL of deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (10 mM), 50 ng of random Hexamer primer, 2 μL of M-MuLV buffer (10X) (Macrogen®, Korea), and 100 U of M-MuLV reverse transcriptase under an initial denaturation at 65 ºC for five minutes and reverse transcription steps at 42 ºC for one hour (Vivantis Technologies, Malaysia). The products were then used in the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and PCR assay. The primers used in the PCR, RT-PCR, and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) assays are presented in
