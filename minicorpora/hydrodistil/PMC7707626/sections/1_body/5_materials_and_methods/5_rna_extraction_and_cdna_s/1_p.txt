0: A total of five MDR isolates were cultured in Muller-Hinton broth and suspended in diluted SKEO with a concentration below the MIC value and incubated at 37 oC for 24 hours.
1: The total RNA was extracted using an RNA extraction kit (Qiagen, USA) according to the manufacturers instruction.
2: Then, cDNA was synthesized in a total volume of 20 L reaction mixture, including 2 g of the extracted RNA, 1 L of deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (10 mM), 50 ng of random Hexamer primer, 2 L of M-MuLV buffer (10X) (Macrogen, Korea), and 100 U of M-MuLV reverse transcriptase under an initial denaturation at 65 oC for five minutes and reverse transcription steps at 42 oC for one hour (Vivantis Technologies, Malaysia).
3: The products were then used in the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and PCR assay.
4: The primers used in the PCR, RT-PCR, and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) assays are presented in  table 1.
