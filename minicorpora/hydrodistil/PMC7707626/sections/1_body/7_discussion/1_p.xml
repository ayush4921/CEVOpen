<p>In the present study, the MIC values of SKEO were in the range of 6 to 12 Âµg/mL, and PAO1 was the most sensitive strain. Treating the MDR strains of 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> to SKEO combined with antibiotics showed a FICI value between 0.37 and 0.45, indicating a synergistic effect. SKEO in combination with gentamicin or norfloxacin did not show any synergistic effect against PAO1 strain. SKEO combined with norfloxacin showed a maximum effect against PA11 (FICI: 0.37). While SKEO reduced the MIC value of gentamicin and norfloxacin by up to 4- and 8-fold, respectively. There was a significant reduction in the expression of 
 <italic>mexE</italic> and 
 <italic>mexY</italic> genes in the presence of SKEO for all isolates (P&lt;0.01). Different concentrations of SKEO significantly reduced 
 <italic>mexE</italic> expression (9.7-fold), and 
 <italic>mexY</italic> (4.99-fold) compared with the control gene. Moreover, the efficacy of SKEO on the gene expression of 
 <italic>mexE</italic> was about two times more than the 
 <italic>mexY</italic> gene. Additionally, the expression of 
 <italic>mexE</italic> gene was 2.18-fold greater than 
 <italic>mexY</italic> gene before treatment.
