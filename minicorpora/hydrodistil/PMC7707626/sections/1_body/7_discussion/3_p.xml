 <italic>mexE</italic>F-OprN confers resistance to doripenem and meropenem, but this resistance could be due to the low expression of OrpD porin.

 </sup> Aminoglycosides act as poor substrates for efflux pumps due to their hydrophilic nature. Studies have shown that they are transported by a large number of efflux pumps (MexXY-OprM) from the resistance-nodulation-division superfamily.

 </sup> We tested the effect of SKEO on the expression of 
 <italic>mexE</italic>F-OprN and MexXY-OprM pumps to assess the role of efflux pumps involved in antibiotic resistance. We found that SKEO reduced the expression of 
 <italic>mexE</italic>F-OprN and mexXY-OprM genes. Moreover, SKEO combined with gentamicin or norfloxacin resulted in a decrease in their MIC values.
