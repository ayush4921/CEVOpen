<p>As expected, an acceptable convergence was observed between checkerboard data and the expression of 
 <italic>mex</italic> genes in all clinical isolates, except for two strains that FICI was not determined. The results showed that SKEO inhibited bacterial growth at a lower dose than gentamicin and norfloxacin. Therefore, SKEO can be more useful than antibiotic therapy due to its mild side effects. In line with our findings, Bahador and colleagues showed that in the presence of SKEO, the expression level of the 
 <italic>bap</italic> gene in 
 <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> decreased by 24-fold.

 </sup> Other studies have also reported that SKEO could reduce the expression of 
 <italic>mexR</italic>, 
 <italic>mexA</italic>, and 
 <italic>exoS</italic> genes in 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strains.

 </sup> In our earlier study, we reported that SKEO had a significant effect on reducing the expression of lasA and lasB of 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>.

 </sup> Similarly, we showed the inhibitory effect of SKEO on the expression of efflux pumps involved in antibiotic resistance.
