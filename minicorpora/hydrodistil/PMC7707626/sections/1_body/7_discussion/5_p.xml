<p>In a previous study, the reported MIC value of the acetonic extract of 
 <italic>Clinopodium vulgare</italic> was similar to our results, while no effects were observed in the presence of ethanolic extract. The difference can be attributed to the rapid evaporation of ethanol and the presence of 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strains with high resistance to gentamicin.

 </sup> Despite a 2- to 4-fold reduction in the MIC value of gentamicin by SKEO, we did not observe any synergistic effect. This meant that the 
 <italic>mexY</italic> gene could not be the only resistance factor against gentamicin. Therefore, further studies are required to identify other possible resistance mechanisms. Finally, it seems that SKEO can be used as a significant EPI in the treatment of patients infected with MDR strains of 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. However, it is suggested to assess its pharmacokinetics, potency, and toxicity in human cells. The main limitation of the present study was a low number of isolates, which should be addressed in future studies.
