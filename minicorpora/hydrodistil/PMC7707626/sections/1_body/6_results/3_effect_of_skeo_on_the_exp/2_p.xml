<p>The 
 <italic>one-way ANOVA</italic> test showed a significant reduction in the expression of 
 <italic>mexE</italic> and 
 <italic>mexY</italic> genes in the presence of SKEO for all isolates (P&lt;0.001). The Livak method also revealed that different concentrations of SKEO significantly reduced 
 <italic>mexE</italic> expression (9.7-fold) and 
 <italic>mexY</italic> (4.99-fold) compared with the control gene. As shown in 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>, pairwise comparisons of the groups using the 
 <italic>post hoc Tukey HSD test</italic> showed that the efficacy of SKEO on the gene expression of 
 <italic>mexE</italic> was about two times more than the 
 <italic>mexY</italic> gene. Moreover, the expression of 
 <italic>mexE</italic> gene was 2.18-fold greater than 
 <italic>mexY</italic> gene before treatment.
