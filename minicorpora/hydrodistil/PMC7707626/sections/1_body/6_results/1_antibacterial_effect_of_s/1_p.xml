<p>The MIC values of gentamicin, norfloxacin, and SKEO against PAO1 and five MDR strains were investigated. As shown in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>, SKEO showed dose-dependent antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strains. The MIC values of SKEO were in the range of 6 to 12 Âµg/mL and the PAO1 was the most sensitive strain.
