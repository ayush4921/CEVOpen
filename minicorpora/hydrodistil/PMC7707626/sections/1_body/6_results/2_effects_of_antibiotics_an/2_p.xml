<p>Treating the MDR strains of 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> to SKEO with antibiotics showed a FICI value between 0.37 and 0.45, indicating a synergistic effect (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>). For most of the tested bacteria, the results of the checkerboard assay were indifferent. A combination of SKEO with gentamicin or norfloxacin did not show any synergistic effect against PAO1 strain. SKEO combined with norfloxacin showed a maximum effect against PA11 (FICI: 0.37). While SKEO reduced the MIC value of gentamicin and norfloxacin by up to 4- and 8-fold, respectively.
