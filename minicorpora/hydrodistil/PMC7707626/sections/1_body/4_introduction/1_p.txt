0: Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( P. aeruginosa) is an important cause of nosocomial infections, which can rapidly develop resistance to many antibiotics through various mechanisms such as the high expression of efflux pumps.
1: 1 Resistance-nodulation-division family transporters are the main category of efflux pumps in  P. aeruginosa and contain at least 10 different types of efflux pumps.
2: 2 MexXY-OprM and  mexEF-OprN are the two most relevant pumps systems involved in resistance to antimicrobial agents.
3: 3 MexXY-OprM has a main role in extruding various antibiotics in  P. aeruginosa isolates, particularly beta-lactam antibiotics.
4: 4 ,   5 Its expression commonly occurs in wild type strains and involves innate bacterial resistance to a number of antibiotics.
5: 2 ,   6 However,  mexEF-OprN pump is expressed at low levels in wild-type isolates  7 ,   8 and contributes to acquired resistance to antibiotics.
