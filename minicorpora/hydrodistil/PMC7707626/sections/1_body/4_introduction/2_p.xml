<p>A previous study described some compounds such as herbal extracts could inhibit the activity of efflux pumps.

 </sup> When plant extracts are used concurrently with chemical drugs, they enhance the effectiveness of antibiotics and can also act as an efflux pump inhibitor (EPI).

 </sup> EPIs interrupt the extruding process of antibiotics by interference with the regulatory steps thereby suppressing the efflux pumps gene expression.

 </sup> Checkerboard and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques can be used to assess the indirect activity of essential oils on the gene expression of efflux pumps. Compared with the checkerboard method, real-time PCR is a rapid technique with a high specificity and sensitivity, low contamination rate, and excellent efficiency in determining the synergistic effect.
