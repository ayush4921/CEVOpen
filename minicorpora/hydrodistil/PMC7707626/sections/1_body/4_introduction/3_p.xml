 </sup> The principal components of 
 <italic>S. khuzistanica</italic> are thymol and carvacrol, which can damage bacteria. These substances, after disruption of efflux pumps, indirectly inhibit the gene expression of efflux pumps. The present study aimed to assess the reduced expression of efflux pump genes of 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> with 
 <italic>S. khuzistanica</italic> essential oil (SKEO).
