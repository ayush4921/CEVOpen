<p>The 
 <italic>Thymus</italic> essential oil chemical composition was affected by plant microenvironment variation directly. In conclusion, the most biological aspects regarding 
 <italic>T. daenensis</italic> antimicrobial, antifungal, and antioxidant activities are associated with the oil constituents. Although direct correlations between the major constituents and biological activities have not been found in some cases, the total phenolic contents are responsible for most behaviors. It seems that the presence of some trace components in the oils may demonstrate severe antagonistic or synergistic behaviors and lead to unpredictable biological functions.
