0: Thymus antioxidant potency was measured using the  -carotene bleaching inhibition in the linoleic acid presence.
1: -carotene/linoleic acid emulsion was prepared by mixing 1 mg  - carotene, 25  l of linoleic acid, and 200 mg Tween-20 in 1 ml of chloroform.
2: The solvent was vacuum-evaporated using a rotary evaporator for 30 minutes at 40C.
3: After that, 100 ml of oxygenated water was composed with robust shaking, in order to form a stable emulsion.
4: 350  l of the essential oil dilutions in ethanol (ranging 0.011.28 mg/ml) was mixed with 2.5 ml of the  -carotene/linoleic emulsion gently, at the final stage.
5: All tubes were placed in a shaker incubator (50 rpm) for 2 hours, in the light and at 50C.
6: The absorbance difference was recorded for 2 hours, using a spectrophotometer against a negative control (NC), which contains all the reagents except oils at 470 nm.
7: The beta-carotene oxidation inhibition percentage (BIC %) was calculated as follows: (2)BIC%=1ASample0 minASample120 minANC0 minANC120 min100.
