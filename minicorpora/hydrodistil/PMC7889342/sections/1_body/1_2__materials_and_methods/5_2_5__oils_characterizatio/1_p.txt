0: An HP-6890 series gas chromatography system was used for the  T. daenensis oil analyses.
1: This Agilent instrument was equipped with an HP-5 capillary column packed with 5% phenyl, and also 95% methylpolysiloxane (30 m  0.32 mm   0.25  m capillary dimensions), and a flame ionization detector (FID).
2: Nitrogen was applied as the carrier, and this gas flow was set on 1 ml/min.
3: The column oven temperature was accurately set for 3 minutes at 60C, and after that progressively increased to 250C for 65 minutes.
4: The injection port and the flame ionization detector were heated to 255 and 290C, respectively.
5: The sample split ratio was 1 : 10 [ 9].
