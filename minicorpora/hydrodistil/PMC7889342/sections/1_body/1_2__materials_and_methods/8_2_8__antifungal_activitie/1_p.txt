0: All of the essential oils ecotypes were examined for their fungal toxic activities individually, by an adapted broth microdilution assay.
1: The  Aspergillus was cultured in Sabouraud dextrose agar at 30C for a week and also stored at 4C for another week in order to spore germinating.
2: The fungal spores were suspended in sterile normal saline solution supplemented with 0.1% v/v Tween-80, and isolated using several sterile cheesecloth aseptically layers.
3: That flow through the spore suspension was counted using a hemocytometer and adjusted at 10 6 spores/ml.
4: 100  l of the conidial spore suspensions was added to 100  l of the essential oil serial dilutions from 0.01 to 5.12 mg/ml in Sabouraud dextrose broth.
5: The plates were shaken for 30 seconds and after that incubated at 28  0.5C and in 80% relative humidity for 72 hours.
6: Appropriate negative controls containing the standard fungal spore suspensions, and DMSO without the test components were produced, in order to confirm the sporangiospores viability, and any unwanted intrinsic effects absence.
7: A fresh Sabouraud dextrose culture was diluted and adjusted to 5  10 6 CFU/ml for  Candida albicans, and 100  l of the suspension was dispensed in a 96-well plate containing 100  l of serially diluted oils and was cultivated for 48 hours at 28C.
8: The pure amphotericin-B serial dilution (0.112.8  g/ml) was used as the reference compound.
9: MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) was the least oil concentration and represented no visible fungal mycelia next to the incubation period.
10: A 5  l portion was subcultivated on Sabouraud dextrose agar and was from the wells with complete fungal growth inhibition and incubated for 72 hours at 28C.
11: MFC (minimum fungicidal concentration) was considered as the lowest oil concentration that killed 99.5% of the inoculated fungi [ 14].
