0: The study of essential oils antibacterial activity was conducted using NCCLS (National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards) guidelines, and the broth microdilution method was applied for the reliable and reproducible results.
1: Cultivated bacterial strains were subcultured on Mueller Hinton Broth (MHB) to an initial OD 600 = 0.1, and incubated again for a few hours at 37C to an OD 600 = 0.5, and were used as the inocula after 1 : 200 dilutions in MHB (standardized at approximately 1  10 6 CFU/ml).
2: 100  l of the bacterial suspension was dispensed in a 96-well plate consisting of 100  l of serially diluted oils in MHB during the range of 0.015.12 mg/ml.
3: Up and about 2.0% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was used as a co-solvent, and it does not alter the test organisms' growth.
4: Negative controls included a standard bacterial suspension, and the DMSO maximum doses without any test components.
5: A serial dilution (a range of 0.5256  g/ml) containing pure ampicillin sodium salt was used as the standard antibacterial agent.
6: Plates were agitated and incubated for 24 hours at 37C.
7: Subsequently, 20  l of MTT solution (0.2 mg/ml) was applied to each well and incubated for 30 minutes at 37C.
8: The lowest sample concentrations without any color changes were determined as the MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration).
9: A 5  l portion from the colorless wells was subcultured on Mueller Hinton Agar (MHA) and was incubated for 24 hours at 37C.
10: MBC (minimum bactericidal concentration) was considered as the least oil concentration that killed 99.5% of the inoculated bacteria [ 12,  13].
