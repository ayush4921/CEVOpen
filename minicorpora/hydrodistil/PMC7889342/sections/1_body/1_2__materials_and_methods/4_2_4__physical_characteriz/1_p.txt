0: The yield was defined as the amount of essential oils formed (ml) related to the 100 g of consumed plant.
1: The oil refractive indices and densities were measured using an Atago RX-7000a refractometer, and a liquid micro-pycnometer.
2: The oils different serial concentrations were provided in methanol (1 : 2, 1 : 4, 1 : 8, 1 : 16, 1 : 32, 1 : 64, 1 : 128, 1 : 256 mg/ml), and absorption spectrum was recorded in absorbance range (2301000 nm) using spectrophotometer (TECAN, Infinite-M200; Austria).
3: The oils molar absorptivity potencies against the UV light were attained using Beer's law ( A =  bC, where  A,  ,  b, and  C stand for absorbance, molar absorptivity, path length, and oil concentration, respectively) [ 7].
