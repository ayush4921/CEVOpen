0: Comet assay is a highly sensitive method for studying of the compounds antigenotoxic activity against the DNA damage in lymphocytes.
1: Lymphocytes were isolated from the volunteer blood samples using Ficoll-Paque TM PLUS2, and a cell suspension of 2  10 5 cells/ml was prepared in the phosphate buffered saline.
2: Then, 1  10 4 cells were treated with the sampled oils serial concentration (0.015 mg/ml) for 30 minutes at 4C.
3: The cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 50  l of PBS and were finally mixed with the equal preheated low-melting-point agarose volume (1.5% w/v).
4: By passing 30 minutes from incubation in ice, the cells were coated again with 100  l of low-melting agarose (0.75% w/v) in order to form a flat sandwich.
5: After that, cell lysis was performed using ice-cold lysis buffer for 4 hours (90 mM EDTA, 2.25 M NaCl, 0.7% w/v NaOH, 9 mM Tris base, 1% v/v Triton X-100, 10% v/v DMSO; pH = 10).
6: Then, the slides were neutralized and electrophoresed on ice under the alkaline conditions (1 mM EDTA, 300 mM NaOH; pH  13) at 0.30 A for 45 minutes.
7: At the next stage, the microgels were neutralized, stained, and pictured with neutral Tris-buffer, ethidium bromide, and fluorescent microscope, respectively.
8: DNA fragmentation was scored using Tritek CometScore13 TM software, and ([tail DNA/(head DNA + tail DNA)]100) equation was applied for the tail DNA% determining.
9: CIC 50 is the sample concentration, which protects 50% genomic DNA from fragmentation using the scatter plot equation [ 7].
