0: Fresh aerial parts of ecotypic  Thymus daenensis Celak were collected from their habitation in Ghazvin, Isfahan, Markazi, Lorestan, and Zanjan provinces.
1: After that was the identification of species; they were harvested from the proposed areas randomly, and the shades dried for two weeks at ambient temperature (2025C).
2: As a part of an ecotypic morphology study, the fresh plant ecotypes macroscopic diameters were measured, and also images were recorded with a digital camera (COOLPIX P510, Nikon, Japan) equipped with GPS.
3: Voucher specimens were recognized and deposited at the Herbarium of Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Zanjan University of Medical Sciences, Zanjan, Iran.
4: The plants were subjected to hydrodistillation using a modified Clevenger's apparatus at 100C for 3 hours.
5: During the hydrodistillation process, plant materials were placed in boiling water.
6: Essential oils could be easily separated from the collecting tube water phase.
7: Anhydrous sodium sulfate was used as drying agent.
8: The oils were stored in the opaque air-tight sealed bottles at 4C for 3 months, until the time of physicochemical and biological tests running [ 8].
