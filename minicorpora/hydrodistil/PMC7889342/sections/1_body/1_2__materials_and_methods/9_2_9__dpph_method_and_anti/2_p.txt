0: Negative controls (NCs) were composed of all the reagents excluding the antioxidant oils.
1: In addition, reference antioxidants were examined like butylated hydroxytoluene and vitamin C (0.5 to 128  g/ml) in order to compare the compounds scavenging potencies.
2: The relative scavenging activities were plotted against the essential oil concentrations, and the SC 50 was considered as the essential oil concentration in order to result in 50% inhibition [ 15].
