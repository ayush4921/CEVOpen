0: The oil samples radical scavenging activities were evaluated against the discoloration of DPPH free radicals purple solution.
1: In order to achieve this goal, 2 ml of prepared methanolic solutions of DPPH (80  g/ml) was mixed with the oils' methanolic dilutions equivalent volumes (final concentration: 0.011.28 mg/ml).
2: The mixtures were incubated for 30 minutes in the darkness at ambient temperature.
3: Absorbance values were recorded at 517 nm using a Tecan Infinite M200 spectrophotometer, and the oils free radical scavenging capacities (SC) were calculated according to the following equation: (1)SC%=ANCASampleANC100.
