0: Volatile constituents were identified using a gas chromatograph (Agilent, GC-7890A, USA) connected to an Electron Ionization Mass Spectroscopy, EIMS-5975C, detector (70 eV energy), and a capillary HP-5 MS well-packed column containing 95% of the methylpolysiloxane, and 5% of phenyl (dimensions: 30 m  0.25 mm  0.25  m).
1: The central oven was preset for 5 minutes at 40C.
2: After that, the temperature was progressively increased to 230C for 20 minutes, and at the final step, temperature was raised up to 280C for 2 minutes (30C/min ramping rate).
3: Detector and injector temperatures were fixed at 240 and 250C, respectively.
4: One  l of the oils was injected with a split ratio of 1 : 10 to the instrument, and also the helium flow rate was tuned to 1 ml/min.
5: The GC-MS analysis was completed using various internal standards for components quantification.
6: The oil components arrangement was conducted based on the retention index ratios along with the homologous normal alkane series retention times under the same running condition.
7: Additional parameters, which were used for the composition description, were the Wiley7n.L library, NIST library, published data fragmentation model, and the authentic compounds mass spectroscopy.
8: The results were expressed as percentages of the individual constituent whole peak area in association with the whole region of all standardized peaks in the chromatogram [ 10,  11].
