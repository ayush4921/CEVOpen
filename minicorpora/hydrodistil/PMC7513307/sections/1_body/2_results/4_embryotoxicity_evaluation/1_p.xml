 <italic>Eryngium triquetrum</italic> extract was toxic to adult snails (infected or uninfected) in a dose-dependent manner (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, 2). For the same range of concentrations, it appears that the egg masses are less sensitive to the essential oil extract. No difference of toxicity and lethality was observed in eggs exposed to concentrations below and around the LC
 <sub>50</sub>. The positive hatching rates were 91.3 ± 4.7%, 93.3 ± 2.8% at the concentrations of 0.1 and 0.5 ppm, respectively compared to the control which yielded 95.7± 0.3% hatching. Embryos and adult 
 <italic>B. glabrata</italic> snails showed different sensitivity to the plant extract since the lethal dose for 100% of the adult snail population (1 ppm) showed moderate embryonic lethal effect, 64.7 ± 7.5% of snail embryos hatched and developed successfully (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).
