<p id="Par31">The molluscicidal activity of the essential oil from 
 <italic>E. triquetrum</italic> was also tested against snails infected with 
 <italic>S. mansoni</italic>. Different essential oil concentrations around the LC
 <sub>50</sub> were used under the same conditions as those described previously. Interestingly, this plant-derived molluscicide seems to be more potent against infected snails. Indeed, no toxic effects were observed in non-infected snails for a concentration of 0.1 ppm while about 20% of infected snails were killed after 24 h exposure. At 0.5 ppm, the essential oil of 
 <italic>E. triquetrum</italic> was 2 times more toxic to parasitized snails with a mortality rate of 88.8 ± 4.8% whereas it was 38.9 ± 12% in the non-infected snails (Fig.
