<p id="Par30">We independently assessed trial toxicity of three extractions of essential oil from 
 <italic>E. triquetrum</italic> against adult 
 <italic>B. glabrata</italic>, the vector snail of the trematode 
 <italic>S. mansoni.</italic> At concentrations above 10 ppm, the mortality rate reached 100% whereby most of the exposed snails retracted into their shells with hemolymph expulsion. From concentrations of 0.5 to 1 ppm, the survival rate of exposed snails varied slightly between the three independent batches of oil extracted. Based on Probit analysis using the survival of treated snails to 
 <italic>E. triquetrum</italic> oils, the concentration required to produce 50% mortality for deaths to 24 h after exposure (LC
 <sub>50</sub>) was 0.51, 0.63, 0.69 ppm for ET02, ET03 and ET01 respectively (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). As the different LC
 <sub>50</sub> values were relatively close, the following toxicity assays were performed with ET03 essential oil extract. Their LC
 <sub>90</sub> values were 0.9, 1.07 and 1.08 respectively.
