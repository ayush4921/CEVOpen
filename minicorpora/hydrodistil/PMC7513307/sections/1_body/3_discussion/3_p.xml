<p id="Par36">In a context of schistosomiasis elimination goal, the characterization of biological activities from plant-derived compounds mainly focuses on molluscicidal toxicity to break the parasite transmission cycle. However, some promising candidates present a dual activity by causing either the death of infective larvae [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>] or developmental abnormalities leading to a low pathogenicity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Mortality values after being exposed only for 24 h at 0.5 ppm were around 75% and 95% for miracidia and cercarciae, respectively, and close to 100% for both after 4 h exposure. Interestingly, no snail death was observed under the same experimental conditions (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1). This falcarinol-enriched extract from 
 <italic>E. triquetrum</italic> also prevents parasite infestation. Indeed, at low level concentrations during a short time exposure (30 min), the snail-parasite compatibility is strongly affected with no parasitized snails at 0.5 ppm. This significant loss of parasite virulence following treatment could be attributed to the shedding of the ciliated plates used by parasites for locomotion and penetration into the snail host (Fig.
