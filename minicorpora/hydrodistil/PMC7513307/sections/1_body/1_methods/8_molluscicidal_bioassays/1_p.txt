0: Biological assays against the snail  B. glabrata were carried out following Phase I of stages of evaluation of molluscicides methods recommended by the WHO [ 31].
1: Briefly, 12 snails with shell diameters of 68 mm were individually exposed to different concentrations of essential oil or DMSO used as control into 12-well tissue culture plate (about 5.5 ml).
2: All snails were immersed during 24 h and then washed and transferred to acrylic tanks filled with 5 liters with well water.
3: Snails were fed with fresh lettuce  ad labitum during the observation period (48 h).
4: Each snail was observed under binocular microscope to appreciate the heart movements.
5: No difference in mortality was found between the different recovery periods, 24 or 48 h respectively.
6: To determine the lethal concentration LC 50, Probit analysis was used from the three independent experiments performed with the different extract of essential oil.
