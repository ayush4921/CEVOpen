<p id="Par23">Concerning assays on infected snails, each snail was exposed to 5 miracidia from the NMRI strain of 
 <italic>S. mansoni</italic>. The procedures of miracidial recovery and snail infection were as conducted and described by Mone et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Snail infection status was assessed by direct observation of daughter sporoscyts through the shell of exposed snails. After 15 days of exposure to parasites, 20â€“30 infected snails were submitted to different doses of essential oil from 
 <italic>E. triquetrum</italic> to compare their toxic sensitivity with non-infected snails. This experiment was repeated three times at different times by different experimenters.
