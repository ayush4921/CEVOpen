<p id="Par22">Biological assays against the snail 
 <italic>B. glabrata</italic> were carried out following Phase I of stages of evaluation of molluscicides methods recommended by the WHO [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Briefly, 12 snails with shell diameters of 6â€“8 mm were individually exposed to different concentrations of essential oil or DMSO used as control into 12-well tissue culture plate (about 5.5 ml). All snails were immersed during 24 h and then washed and transferred to acrylic tanks filled with 5 liters with well water. Snails were fed with fresh lettuce 
 <italic>ad labitum</italic> during the observation period (48 h). Each snail was observed under binocular microscope to appreciate the heart movements. No difference in mortality was found between the different recovery periods, 24 or 48 h respectively. To determine the lethal concentration LC
 <sub>50</sub>, Probit analysis was used from the three independent experiments performed with the different extract of essential oil.
