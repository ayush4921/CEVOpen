0: Toxicity of the essential oil was evaluated against egg masses exposed during 24 h at three concentrations (1, 0.5 and 0.1 ppm).
1: Embryonic development of the snails in egg masses was followed for 20 days under a binocular microscope after egg hatching.
2: Polystyrene sheets served as substrate for oviposition.
3: Egg masses were collected gently to avoid damaging them and maintained in Petri dishes with Volvic water.
4: Twenty-four hours after exposition, the egg masses were washed with Volvic water and placed in a cell culture plate (Sarstedt).
5: No selection of egg masses has been done according to the stage of development.
6: The presence of all embryonic stages (blastula, gastrula, trochophore, veliger and hippo stage) has been checked.
7: This toxicity test was carried out twice on more than 25 egg masses per condition.
