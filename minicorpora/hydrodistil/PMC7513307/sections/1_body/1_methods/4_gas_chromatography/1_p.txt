0: Essential oil samples were analyzed with Thermo Scientific Focus GC with Detector Flame Ionization (FID) using an SPB-1 column fused silica capillary (30 m  0.25 mm  0.25 m) with helium as the carrier gas (flow rate 1.0 ml/min) and an injection volume of 1 l (solution in cyclohexane); the initial pressure was 1.0 Pa.
1: The oven temperature was programmed as follows: 60 C for 3 min, 60240 C (3 C min 1), 240300 C (10 C min 1) and 300 C for 10 min.
2: The injector temperature was 235 C, the detector temperature was 300 C with injection in the splitless mode.
3: The analyses lasted 80 min.
4: Samples were analyzed in triplicate.
5: The retention indices (RIs) of the compounds were determined related to the retention times (RT) of a series of n-alkanes (C7-C40) using the Van den Dool-Kratz equation.
