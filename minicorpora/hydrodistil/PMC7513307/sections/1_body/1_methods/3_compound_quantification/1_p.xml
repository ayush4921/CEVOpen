<p id="Par17">Quantification of the oil components was performed using the methodology reported by Rubiolo et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and adapted in our laboratory [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Briefly, the compound quantification was carried out using peak normalization, including FID response factors (RFs) relative to tridecane (0.7 g/100 g) used as internal standard, and expressed as normalized contents (% abundances).
