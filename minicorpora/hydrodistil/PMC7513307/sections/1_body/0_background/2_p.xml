<p id="Par11">The complexity of the parasite life-cycle gives rise to a complex list of requirements to obtain a successful control programme. Traditional models based exclusively on the use of schistosomicidal drugs have proven to significantly reduce morbidity in infected individuals, but the prevalence in the field remains high after decades of treatment. Indeed, continuous mass drug administration (MDA) campaigns in Africa and Brazil with PZQ, were not successful to eradicate the disease and a high prevalence and territorial expansion of infection areas are still detected worldwide [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Besides this, control strategies based only on one trial are struggling and deserve special attention since cases of rapid adaptation of the parasites to various treatment or specific environmental cues have been documented [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. To integrate MDA approaches, the WHO recommends the use of the synthetic molluscicide niclosamide (Bayluscide
 <sup>®</sup>) as one of the strategies to fight schistosomiasis in the field [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, niclosamide has high a production value and can induce several secondary effects, such as bioaccumulation and high toxicity in non-target animals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Also, snails resistant to niclosamide appeared recently and thus finding new molluscicides becomes necessary [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. It is currently expected that we will see the development of a new class of safer molluscicides, which should be less harmful to the non-target organisms and, if possible, will be more selective to snails infected with schistosomes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Increasing efforts have been made to focus on identifying and characterizing plant-derived molluscicides as safer alternatives [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].
