<p id="Par12">In this study, we have focused on an essential oil extracted from 
 <italic>Eryngium triquetrum</italic>. This Apiaceae is an endemic species of northern Africa, distributed in all parts of Algeria; the green perennial plant becomes a bluish-purplish color when ripe. This species grows particularly well in rocky pastures. It was considered as a ruderal species, which the local people call ‘choukzerk’ [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. No traditional use for this thorny plant has been reported by the Algerian population. However, species of the genus 
 <italic>Eryngium</italic> are used as a folk remedy for the treatment of various inflammatory disorders, and as an emetic infusion, antidote for poisons, hypoglycemic, antitussive and diuretic agents [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Species of 
 <italic>Eryngium</italic> have been subjects of many phytochemical studies. For example, hexanic extract of 
 <italic>E. campestre</italic> showed anti-trypanosomal and leishmanial activities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. 
 <italic>Eryngium caeruleum</italic> extract displayed antimicrobial activities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The essential oil of 
 <italic>E. triquetrum</italic> for which the chemical composition was reported exhibits a moderate antibacterial action against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria [
