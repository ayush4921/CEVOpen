0: Water-borne infectious diseases, mainly those involving digenetic parasites, are mediated by both ecological and socioeconomic processes, and constitute an important public health problem in developing countries [ 1].
1: Schistosomiasis is one of the most common parasitic diseases worldwide [ 2].
2: It is particularly prevalent among people living in rural or deprived urban or peri-urban settings with limited access to clean water and with inadequate sanitation provision [ 3,  4].
3: Digenetic schistosomes have complex life-cycles entailing both mammalian hosts, including humans, and freshwater snail hosts.
4: During their development, schistosomes have to deal with organic and inorganic compounds once in freshwater and then must face a multitude of molecules once inside both hosts [ 5].
5: For the control of schistosomiasis, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the mass administration of the chemotherapeutic praziquantel (PZQ), but also health education, technical cooperation between health institutions and research to verify the elimination of infection, and control of snail populations [ 2,  6].
