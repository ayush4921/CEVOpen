0: Two replicates were included in this report because that was sufficient for the statistical analyses.
1: Beginning of the distillation was noted when the first drop of EO was eluted out of the condenser and deposited in the collection part of the Clevenger apparatus.
2: All samples were distilled non-stop for 180 min.
3: At the end of the distillation, the heat source was removed, the EO was measured in the graduated part of the apparatus by volume, the EOs (along with some water) were collected in glass vials and placed in a freezer.
4: After all distillations were completed, the EO was separated from water, measured on an analytical scale, and kept in a freezer until the gas chromatography (GC) analyses could be performed.
5: Herewith, we report the EO as volume by weight in hemp fresh material.
