<p>The soil at the Research Station at Backi Petrovac is alluvial chernozem with pH of 7.2. Fertilization was performed following the guidelines for fiber hemp and included broadcast application of NPK 16:16:16 at 300 kg/ha prior to plowing in the fall. The soil was prepared after the harvest of millet, the previous crop. Soil preparation consisted of deep plowing in 12 November 2018, followed by disking and cultivation in 25 March 2019 for the establishment of a suitable seedbed. The traditional industrial hemp (grain and/or fiber) in most of northern, middle and southeastern Europe is grown as rainfed, without irrigation; it is traditionally planted early (Marchâ€“April) and because of its deep fast-growing root system it is able to efficiently utilize winter moisture accumulated in the soil. Therefore, hemp cv. Novosadksa was also grown without irrigation. The crop was seeded on 27 March 2019 at between row spacing of 50 cm and seeding rate of 30 kg/ha with a corn planter as a row crop. During the vegetation, plots were kept weed-free by mechanical cultivation between the rows during the initial vegetative stages until the crop closes the canopy (around 5 weeks after emergence). Hemp was left to form seed and was sampled for essential oil (EO) extraction in 2 October 2019 by cutting the top 50 cm of female plants from three plots.</p>
