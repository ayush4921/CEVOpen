0: The soil at the Research Station at Backi Petrovac is alluvial chernozem with pH of 7.2.
1: Fertilization was performed following the guidelines for fiber hemp and included broadcast application of NPK 16:16:16 at 300 kg/ha prior to plowing in the fall.
2: The soil was prepared after the harvest of millet, the previous crop.
3: Soil preparation consisted of deep plowing in 12 November 2018, followed by disking and cultivation in 25 March 2019 for the establishment of a suitable seedbed.

5: Therefore, hemp cv.
6: Novosadksa was also grown without irrigation.
7: The crop was seeded on 27 March 2019 at between row spacing of 50 cm and seeding rate of 30 kg/ha with a corn planter as a row crop.
8: During the vegetation, plots were kept weed-free by mechanical cultivation between the rows during the initial vegetative stages until the crop closes the canopy (around 5 weeks after emergence).
9: Hemp was left to form seed and was sampled for essential oil (EO) extraction in 2 October 2019 by cutting the top 50 cm of female plants from three plots.
