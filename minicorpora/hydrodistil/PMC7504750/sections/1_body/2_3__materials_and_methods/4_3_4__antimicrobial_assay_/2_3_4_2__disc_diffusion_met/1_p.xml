<p>For the agar disc diffusion method, a 100 µL of 106 CFU/mL bacterial suspensions after incubation was spread on the Mueller Hinton Agar (MHA, Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK). Filter paper discs (6 mm in diameter) were infused with 15 µl of the EO tested and placed on the inoculated MHA. MHA was kept at 4 °C for 2 h and then at 37 °C for 24 h. For yeasts, 100 µL 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU/mL the yeast suspension was spread on Sabouraud agar (SA, Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK) and agars were cultivated at 25 °C for 24 h. After the incubation period, the diameter of inhibition zones was measured (mm). Growth inhibition was compared with the standard drugs. The standard drugs cefoxitin for G
 <sup>−</sup> bacteria, gentamycin for G
 <sup>+</sup> bacteria and fluconazole for yeasts were used as positive controls. Tests were performed in three separate experiments, and the means were calculated.
