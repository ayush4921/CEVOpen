0: For the agar disc diffusion method, a 100 L of 106 CFU/mL bacterial suspensions after incubation was spread on the Mueller Hinton Agar (MHA, Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK).
1: Filter paper discs (6 mm in diameter) were infused with 15 l of the EO tested and placed on the inoculated MHA.
2: MHA was kept at 4 C for 2 h and then at 37 C for 24 h. For yeasts, 100 L 10 6 CFU/mL the yeast suspension was spread on Sabouraud agar (SA, Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK) and agars were cultivated at 25 C for 24 h. After the incubation period, the diameter of inhibition zones was measured (mm).
3: Growth inhibition was compared with the standard drugs.
4: The standard drugs cefoxitin for G  bacteria, gentamycin for G + bacteria and fluconazole for yeasts were used as positive controls.
5: Tests were performed in three separate experiments, and the means were calculated.
