0: The oven temperature program used was: 40 C for 0min, increased to 300 C with 5 C/min, held for 10 min.
1: The flow rate of the carrier gas (He) was 1.0 mL/min.
2: The injection volume was 1.0 L at split ratio 20:1.
3: The temperatures of the ionization source, the quadrupole and the injector were 230 C, 150 C, and 250 C respectively.
4: The MSD was operated in full scan mode and all mass spectra were obtained at 70 eV in EI mode.
5: The constituents present in the EO samples were identified by comparing their linear retention indices (LRI) and MS fragmentation patterns with those from the NIST08 and Adams mass spectra libraries.
6: The estimated LRI were determined using a mixture of aliphatic hydrocarbons (C8 to C40) under the same conditions described above.
