0: The GC-FID analysis of the EOs was conducted with a 7890A gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) coupled to a FID and HP-5 silica fused capillary column (30 m length  0.32 mm i.d.
1: 0.25 m film thickness).
2: The oven temperature was programmed as mentioned above, whereas the detector and injector temperatures were 280 C and 220 C, respectively.
3: The carrier gas was helium at a flow rate of 1.0  mL/min.
4: EOs (1.0  L) were injected using the split mode.
5: The percentage composition of EO samples was calculated using the peak normalization method.
