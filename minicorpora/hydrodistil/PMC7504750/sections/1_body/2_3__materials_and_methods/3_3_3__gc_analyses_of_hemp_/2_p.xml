<p>The oven temperature program used was: 40 °C for 0min, increased to 300 °C with 5 °C/min, held for 10 min. The flow rate of the carrier gas (He) was 1.0 mL/min. The injection volume was 1.0 µL at split ratio 20:1. The temperatures of the ionization source, the quadrupole and the injector were 230 °C, 150 °C, and 250 °C respectively. The MSD was operated in full scan mode and all mass spectra were obtained at 70 eV in EI mode. The constituents present in the EO samples were identified by comparing their linear retention indices (LRI) and MS fragmentation patterns with those from the NIST′08 and Adams mass spectra libraries. The estimated LRI were determined using a mixture of aliphatic hydrocarbons (C8 to C40) under the same conditions described above.</p>
