<p>The GC-FID analysis of the EOs was conducted with a 7890A gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) coupled to a FID and HP-5 silica fused capillary column (30 m length × 0.32 mm i.d. 0.25 µm film thickness). The oven temperature was programmed as mentioned above, whereas the detector and injector temperatures were 280 °C and 220 °C, respectively. The carrier gas was helium at a flow rate of 1.0  mL/min. EOs (1.0  μL) were injected using the split mode. The percentage composition of EO samples was calculated using the peak normalization method.</p>
