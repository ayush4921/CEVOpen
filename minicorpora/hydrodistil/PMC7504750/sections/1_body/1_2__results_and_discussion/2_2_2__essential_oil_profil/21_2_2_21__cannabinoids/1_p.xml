<p>The sum of the cannabinoids identified in this study (
 <italic>δ</italic>9-tetrahydrocannabivarin, cannabicyclol, cannabidiol (CBD), cannabichromene, 
 <italic>δ</italic>8-tetrahydrocannabinol, 
 <italic>δ</italic>9-tetrahydrocannabinol (dronabinol)) was 6.58% in the control EO; cannabinoids concentration in the EO fractions were 0–5.97% and 0–6.12% from the nonground and ground material, respectively. These results suggest a likelihood for some type of conversion happening during the 180 min non-stop distillation that results in higher cannabinoids content in the EO. It has been known that THC and CBD are not formed enzymatically in hemp; they are decarboxylated forms of CBDA and THCA, and postharvest processing plays a significant role in their formation [

In this study, cannabinoids were eluted late in the distillation process, consequently resulting in larger amount in the later collected EO fractions of both ground and nonground materials. The highest concentration of cannabinoids was found in the 80–120 min DT fraction of the ground material (
