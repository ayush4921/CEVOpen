<p>Converse trends were observed with the amount of sesquiterpenes. The amount of sesquitepenes was 46.9% in the control EO, and their concentration ranges in the EO fractions were 21.1–80.3% and 13.7–42.3% in the nonground and ground materials, respectively. Grinding decreased the amount of sesquiterpenes in the EO fractions, while later sampling times increased it. Therefore, the highest amount of sesquiterpenes was found in the 80–120 min DT of nonground material (
