<p>The concentration of THC (
 <italic>δ</italic>9-tetrahydrocannabinol or Dronabinol) was 0.142% in the control EO, and its ranges were n.d.–0.11% and n.d.–0.1% in the fractions from the nonground and ground material, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-03943">Supplementary Tables S2 and S3</xref>). This study showed that THC-free EO can be obtained if the EO distillation is limited to 120 min. However, this will also reduce the amount of CBD and sesquiterpenes in the EO. The concentration of THC is regulated internationally, e.g., most countries require that the THC concentration in hemp be below 0.3% and in some countries such as France it must be below 0.2% dry weight (Regulation EC No. 1124/2008, Annex XII). In the U.S., hemp with THC &gt; 0.3% on dry weight basis is considered marijuana. Registered industrial hemp cultivars (varieties) differ in their THC concentration, but generally, it is very low. In a study of 24 industrial hemp cultivars, THC varied from 0.03 (in cv. USO-13) to 0.75% (in cv. Secuieni 1) in dry matter [

The THC concentration in the EO of hemps from the same region was from n.d. to 3.4% in wild hemps, and from n.d. in the EO of cvs. Bacalmas, CS, Spic, Dioica, and Helena, to 0.42% in Sequieni, 0.76% in cv. Simba, and 0.96% in cv. Carmagnola [

The THCA concentration in drug-type hemp may be very high, e.g., THCA was 3.2–26.3% dry weight of flowers from varieties Blackberry Kush, Black Lime, Canna Tsu, Cherry Chem, Valley Fire, Mamma Thai, Sour Diesel, Terple, and White Cookies [
