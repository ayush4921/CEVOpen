<p>Grinding resulted in a marginally significant decrease in the CBD concentration of the EO (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-03943-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). Most of the CBD came out later in the distillation process; therefore, its highest concentration (5–6%) was in the 120–180 min DT fraction. The concentration of CBD in the control EO was 5.67%, while its concentration in the EO fractions was n.d.–5.27% and n.d.–6.124 in the nonground and ground materials, respectively. In a recent study on the EO from wild hemps and registered cultivars, the concentration of CBD in the EO of wild hemp was 6.9–52.4%, and CBD in the EO of the registered cultivars was 7.1–25.4%, and its content in one CBD strain from U.S. varied from 7.4 to 8.8% [
