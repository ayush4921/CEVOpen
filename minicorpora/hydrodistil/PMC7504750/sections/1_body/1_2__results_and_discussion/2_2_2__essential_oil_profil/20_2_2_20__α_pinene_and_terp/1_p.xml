<p>The concentrations of 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene and terpinolene were greater in the EO fractions from the ground material compared with the ones in the nonground material (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-03943-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). The concentrations of both constituents were much higher in the initial DT EO fractions compared with the control EO. This was expected because the two constituents are known to be some of the most volatile ones in hemp EO [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-25-03943" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. While the concentration of 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene in the control EO was 3.2%, grinding of the material resulted in 14.8% of 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene overall in all fractions. 
 <italic>α</italic>-Pinene was identified as one of the determinants of hemp scent emitting by the plant [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-25-03943" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The concentration of 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene in this study (14.9% of the total oil) was similar to its concentrations reported in the literature: 11% [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-25-03943" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], 17.0% [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-25-03943" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and 11–17% [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-25-03943" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In a recent study on registered cultivars in the same region, 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene in the EO varied from n.d. to 8.4% [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-25-03943" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], indicating that genetics plays a key role in the accumulation of this bicyclic monoterpene in hemp. The results from this study on 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene are similar to previous reports following either steam or hydrodistillation [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-25-03943" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], although a bit lower concentration of 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene have been reported [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-25-03943" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-25-03943" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Total sesquiterpenes in nine drug-type hemp varieties was 0.16–0.93% in dried flowers [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-25-03943" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].
