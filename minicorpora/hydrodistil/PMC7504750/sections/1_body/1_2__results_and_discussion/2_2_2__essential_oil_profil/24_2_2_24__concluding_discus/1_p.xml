<p>Hemp control EO and the hemp EO fractions in this study had differential chemical composition, they both are mixture of terpenes and cannabinoids, probably non-psychotropic due to the very low concentrations of THC; however they may possess various types of bioactivity including in humans, due to “entourage-effect” as described previously [

This study demonstrated that EO fractions can be obtained from a single hemp cultivar by modulating grinding before distillation and fractions generation in time. Indeed, this study provided hemp EOs with greater diversity of mixture of terpenes and cannabinoids compared with the 17 commercially available hemp EO from a number of hemp cultivars: Antàl (EO1), Bielobrzerski (EO2), Carmagnola (EO3), Carmagnola CS (EO4), Dioica 88 (EO5), Fedora 17 (EO6), Ferimon (EO7), Finola (EO8), Futura 75(EO9), KC Virtus (EO10), KC Zuzana (EO11), Markant (EO12), Santhica 27 (EO13), Santhica 70 (EO14), Tiborszallasi (EO15), Tygra (EO1) and Zenith (EO17) [
