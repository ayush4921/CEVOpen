<p>The concentration of 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene in the control EO was 3.1%, its concentration ranges were 0.75–7.0% and 3.7–8.3% in the EO fractions of the nonground and ground materials, respectively. 
 <italic>β</italic>-Pinene was eluted early in the hydrodistillation of the ground material and decreased in later DT; however, the dynamics of its elution in the non-ground material was different, with maximum elution in the 80–120 and 0.5 DT and the lowest in the 20–80 min DT (

 <italic>β</italic>-Pinene is a bicyclic monoterpene and along with the 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene, one of the determinants of hemp EO aroma. Its concentration in the control EO of this study was similar to previous reports [
