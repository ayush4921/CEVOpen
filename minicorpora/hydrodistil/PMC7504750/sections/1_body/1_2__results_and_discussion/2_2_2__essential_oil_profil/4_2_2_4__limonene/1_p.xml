<p>Limonene concentration in the control EO was 2.38%, which was within the range reported previously [

In a previous study at the same location, limonene in the EO was n.d.–0.76% in feral hemps, and n.d.–0.29 in cv. Bacalmas, 0.59% in cv. Carmagnola, 0.92% in cv Helena, and 1.29% in cv Simba were [
