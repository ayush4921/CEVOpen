<p>The concentration of humulene epoxide 2 (bicyclic sesquiterpenoid) was 1.6% in the control EO, it ranged from 0.25 to 2.6% in the EO fractions of the nonground material and was 0.45–1.78% in the EO fractions of the ground material (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-03943">Supplementary Tables S2 and S3</xref>). Overall, grinding decreased its concentration in the EO. There was a positive trend towards increased concentration of both ground and nonground materials with increasing DT (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-03943-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The highest concentration was found in the 20–80 and 80–120 min DT EO fraction of nonground material (
