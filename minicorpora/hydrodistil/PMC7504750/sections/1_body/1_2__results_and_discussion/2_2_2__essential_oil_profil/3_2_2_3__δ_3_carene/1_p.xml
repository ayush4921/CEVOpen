<p>The concentration of 
 <italic>δ</italic>-3-carene in the control EO was 4.5%, and its concentration ranges were 4.3–8.2% and 3.5–5.7% in the EO fractions from the nonground and ground materials, respectively (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-03943-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The concentration of 
 <italic>δ</italic>-3-carene was the highest in the 0–5 min DT from nonground material. 
 <italic>δ</italic>-3-Carene is a bicyclic monoterpene, found in all types of hemp [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-25-03943" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In a previous study, its concentration was found to be n.d.–62% in wild hemp EO, and n.d. to 0.19, 0.45, and 0.79% in the EO of hemp cultivars Carmagnola, Simba, and Dioica, respectively [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-25-03943" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Recent studies reported n.d. to 0.1% 
 <italic>δ</italic>-3-carene in the EO of cv. CS [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-25-03943" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and 0.2–0, and 0.2–0.3% in the EO of cv Felina 32 [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-25-03943" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and again 0.2% in the EO of Felina [
