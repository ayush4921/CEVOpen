<p>Eucalyptol (1,8-cineol) concentration in the control EO was 1.38%, and its ranges in the EO fractions were 0.00–2.65% and 0.2–4.3% in the nonground and ground materials, respectively. The concentration of eucalyptol was the highest in the 0–5 min ground and in the 80–120 min nonground material fractions. While the concentration of this constituent decreased in later DT fractions from the ground material, a somewhat reverse trend was observed with its concentration in the nonground material (
