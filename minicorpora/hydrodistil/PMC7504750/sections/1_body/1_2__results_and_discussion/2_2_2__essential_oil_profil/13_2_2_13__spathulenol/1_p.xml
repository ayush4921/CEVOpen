<p>The concentration of spathulenol, a tricyclic sesquiterpenoid, was 2.38% in the control EO, and its ranges in the nonground and ground materials were 0.58–2.88 and 0.79–2.35%, respectively. Its highest concentration was in the 80–120 min DT fraction of the nonground material. The trend was towards increasing its concentrations with increasing time. Generally, the concentration of this constituent was higher than in eight other registered hemp cultivars (n.d.–0.64%), and in most of wild hemps with the exception of one that had 2.5% spathulenol in its EO [
