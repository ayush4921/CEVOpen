<p>The concentration of caryophyllene oxide, a bicyclic sesquiterpenoid, was 3.8% in the control EO, which was within the concentration ranges reported previously [

 <xref rid="B26-molecules-25-03943" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Its range in the EO fractions were 1.1–7.9% and n.d.–5.8% in the nonground and in ground materials, respectively. Its concentration was the highest in the 80–120 min EO fraction of nonground material. Overall, its concentration increased in later DT fractions of both ground and nonground materials. This study shows that if caryophyllene oxide is desirable in the EO, its concentration can be increased twofold by collecting EO eluted after 80 min. The concentration of caryophyllene oxide in the hemps EO from the same region was 8.6–16.6% in new hemp breeding lines, 4.2–6.6% in eight registered hemp cultivars, and 0.2–31% in eight wild hemps [
