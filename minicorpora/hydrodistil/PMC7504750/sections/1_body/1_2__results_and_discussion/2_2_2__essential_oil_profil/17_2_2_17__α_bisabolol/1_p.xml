<p>The concentration of 
 <italic>α</italic>-bisabolol, monocyclic sesquiterpenoid, was 1.33% in the control EO, its concentrations in the EO fractions were n.d.–2.63 in the nonground material and n.d.–1.68 in the ground fractions (

 <xref rid="molecules-25-03943-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). Generally, grinding reduced the amount of 
 <italic>α</italic>-bisabolol in the EO, and its concentration increased with in later sampling times. Therefore, its concentration was the highest in the 80–120 min DT fraction of the nonground material (

 <italic>α</italic>-Bisabolol was reported in commercial hemp EO [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-25-03943" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The concentration of 
 <italic>α</italic>-bisabolol in hemp EO from the same region were 0.1–2.8% in wild hemps, and from n.d. to 6.7% in eight other registered hemp cultivars [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-25-03943" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The concentration of 
 <italic>α</italic>-bisabolol in the EO of cv. Carmagnola Selezionata was 0.4–0.5% of the relative peak area [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-25-03943" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and below 1% in 17 commercial EOs [
