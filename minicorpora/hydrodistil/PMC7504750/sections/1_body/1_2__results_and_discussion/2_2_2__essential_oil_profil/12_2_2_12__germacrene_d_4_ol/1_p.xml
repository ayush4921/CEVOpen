<p>The concentration of the germacrene D-4-ol, a monocyclic sesquiterpenoid, was 1.63% in the control EO; its range was 0.71–3.45 in the EO fractions from the nonground material and 0.61–1.38 in the EO fractions from the ground material. Its highest concentration was found in the 80–120 min DT fraction (

This EO constituent was reported to vary from n.d. to 1.64% in eight registered hemp cultivars, 0.2–1.2% in eight new hemp breeding lines, and 0.1–1.9% in eight wild hemps [
