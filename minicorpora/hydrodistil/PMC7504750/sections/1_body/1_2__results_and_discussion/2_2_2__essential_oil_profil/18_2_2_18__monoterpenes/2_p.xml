<p>The monoterpenes concentration in the EO fractions was 12.9–76.9% and 54.5–83.9% in the nonground and ground materials, respectively. Grinding increased the amount of monoterpenes in the EO. The amount of monoterpenes was 44.9% in the control EO. The highest concentration of monoterpenes was found in the 0–5 and 5–10 min DT fractions of the ground material. The results showed that the total concentration of monoterpenes in hemp EO could be significantly modified by grinding and distillation time. The total amount of monoterpenes in the EO of other hemps from the same region was reported to be from n.d. in two wild hemps to 8.0% in other wild hemps, and 1.4–13.5% in eight registered hemp cultivars [
