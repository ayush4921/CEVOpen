<p>As expected, most of the monoterpenes were eluted early in the distillation process and therefore, their concentrations were the highest in the initial DT fraction, and gradually decreased in the later fractions (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-03943-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). The concentration of the monoterpenes in the control EO was 44.4%, which was within the concentration range of monoterpenes (31% and 83% of the total peak area) identified in 17 commercial hemp EO [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-25-03943" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and their concentration (around 41%) in hemp cv. Futura 75 EO [
