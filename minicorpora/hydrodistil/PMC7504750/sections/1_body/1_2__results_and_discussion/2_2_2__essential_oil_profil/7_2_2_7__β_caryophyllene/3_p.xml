 <italic>β</italic>-Caryophyllene, bicyclic sesquiterpene, is one of the major hemp EO constituents, be it from industrial hemp (grain and fiber) [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-25-03943" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], US strains grown for non-psychoactive cannabinoids such as CBD and CBG [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-25-03943" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], or in the drug-type (marijuana strains) [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-25-03943" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-25-03943" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. This study demonstrated that while the concentration of 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene was 8–10% in the control hemp EO; a 20% 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene rich EO can be produced by collecting the EO in the 80–120 DT. This compound is a constituent of many other EOs and is known as a dietary cannabinoid; it can bind with high affinity to the CB2 cannabinoid receptor in peripheral tissues [
