 <italic>β</italic>-Caryophyllene concentration in the control EO was 9.1%, which was low compared with its concentration in the EO of other registered cultivars grown in the same location [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-25-03943" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In the latter report, the concentration of 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene was 15.4–26.8% in wild hemps, and 25–40% in eight registered hemp cultivars, and 6.5–7.5% in the EO of U.S. hemp strain grown for commercial production of CBD [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-25-03943" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Apparently, different cultivars can accumulate and yield vastly different concentrations of 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene even when they are grown in the same location and under the same agronomic practices. Overall, 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene in the EO of this study was within previously reported ranges [

 <xref rid="B27-molecules-25-03943" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-25-03943" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,
