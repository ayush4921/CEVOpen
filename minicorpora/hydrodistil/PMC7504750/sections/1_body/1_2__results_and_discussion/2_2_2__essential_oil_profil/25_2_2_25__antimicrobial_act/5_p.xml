<p>Overall, the EO fractions from the ground material had higher antimicrobial activity against the tested microorganisms compared to those from nonground materials (

The highest activity against SA was recorded by the use of either the 5–10 min or 20–80 min DT EO fraction and the highest activity against SE was recorded by the use of the 10–20 min DT EO fraction (from either ground or nonground materials) (
