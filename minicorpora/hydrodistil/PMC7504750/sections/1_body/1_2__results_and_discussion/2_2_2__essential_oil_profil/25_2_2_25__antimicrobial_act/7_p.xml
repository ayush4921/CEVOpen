<p>Hemp extract using organic solvent exhibited very good antimicrobial activity against

 <sup>+</sup> and G
 <sup>âˆ’</sup> bacteria and against the fungi. However, the aqueous extract did not show any antimicrobial activity [

 <xref rid="B20-molecules-25-03943" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] promising inhibitory activities of hemp oils against G
 <sup>+</sup> opportunistic/pathogens such as 
 <italic>Clostridium</italic> spp. and 
 <italic>Enterococcus</italic> spp. was shown. The results of Iseppi et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-25-03943" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] showed a good antibacterial activity of six hemp EOs against the G
 <sup>+</sup> bacteria, thus suggesting that hemp EO can inhibit or reduce bacterial proliferation and it can be a valid support to reduce microorganism contamination, especially in the food processing field.
