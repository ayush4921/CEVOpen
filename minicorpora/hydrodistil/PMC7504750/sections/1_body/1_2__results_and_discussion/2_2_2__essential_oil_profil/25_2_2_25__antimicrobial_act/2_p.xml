<p>The Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) results that show the significance of the main and interaction effects of Material (2 levels: Ground and Nonground) and Distillation time (DT; 6 levels: 0–5 min, 5–10 min, 10–20 min, 20–80 min, 80–120 min, and 120–160 min) on nine these antimicrobial activities (SA, EF, SP, PA, YE, SE, CA, CK, CT) are presented in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-03943-t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>. The results indicate that the interaction effect was not significant on SA and SE, but the main effect of Material was significant on SA, and the main effect DT was significant on SA and SE. The interaction effect of Material and DT was significant on EF, PA, SP, YE, CA, CK, and CT (
