<p>As positive control, the antibiotics gentamycin for G
 <sup>+</sup>, cefoxitin for G
 <sup>−</sup> and fluconazole for yeasts were used. Inhibition zones of the antibiotics were generally greater in comparison with inhibition zones of the essential oil fractions. In this study, the antibiotics had greater effect on bacteria than on yeasts. The absence of outer cell membrane makes the bacteria vulnerable to the effect of antibiotics. This argument is supported by previous reports on G
 <sup>+</sup> and G
 <sup>−</sup> bacteria and their resistance to antibiotics [

 <sup>−</sup> bacteria is thought to play an important role as a protective mechanism against antimicrobial agents and antibiotic selection pressure [
