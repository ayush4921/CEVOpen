<p>The concentration of

 <italic>E</italic>)-bergamotene, a bicyclic sesquiterpene, was around 2.3% in the control EO, and 1.1–3.3% and 0.5–1.1% in the EO fractions of the nonground and ground materials, respectively. Its highest concentration was found in the 80–120 min DT fraction of the nonground material (

Interestingly, its concentration in the control oil was the highest, which might be an indication of converting some constituents in the collection part of the Clevenger apparatus during the hydrodistillation process. Generally, the concentrations of this EO constituent in the present study were comparable to the ones from a previous study at the same location but other cultivars, where the concentration range of 
 <italic>α</italic>-(
 <italic>E</italic>)-bergamotene in the EO was 0.36–4.4% in the registered cultivars. The concentration of this constituent in the EO was similar to a previously reported concentration (3.2%) by Smerglio et al. [
