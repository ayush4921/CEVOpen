<p>The concentration of 
 <italic>α</italic>-humulene (
 <italic>α</italic>-caryophyllene), monocyclic sesquiterpene, was 4.4% in the control oil, 3.0–11.7% and 1.8–4.3% in the EO fractions, of the nonground and ground materials, respectively. The highest concentration of this constituent was found in the EO of the 80–120 min DT fraction of the nonground. This constituent has been reported in hemp EO by other researchers [

The EO of other hemps from the same region extracted using the same method for the same time duration had concentrations of 10.5–17.4 in eight registered hemp cultivars, 4.4–7.6% in eight new hemp lines, and 5.3–11.9% in eight wild hemps [
