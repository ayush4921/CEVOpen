<p>Non-stop distillation of the hemp biomass for 180 min yielded 0.46% EO, while the EO yield of the ground material (sum of 0–120 min was 0.315%, and the EO yield of nonground material was 0.42%. These results demonstrated that the process of removing EO fractions did not compromise the EO yields. The EO content in this study was higher than that reported EO yield in cv. Fedora 17 [

 <xref rid="B29-molecules-25-03943" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. These results may suggest that drying of hemp material may significantly reduce the EO yield.
