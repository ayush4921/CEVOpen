<p>Eighty-nine (89) constituents were identified in the hemp EO, belonging to monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and cannabinoids, although not all constituents were found in all of the distillation timeframe (DT) fractions (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-03943">Supplementary Tables S2 and S3</xref>). The essential oil (EO) sampled at different time points during the hydrodistillation of either ground or non-ground hemp material had a dissimilar profile, as individual EO constituents come out at different times (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-03943">Supplementary Tables S2 and S3</xref>). We statistically analyzed only 26 constituents, with the highest concentration in the EO. As indicated in the Materials and Methods section, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) of a 2 × 5 factorial design was completed to determine the significance of the main and interaction effects of Material (two levels: Ground and Nonground) and Distillation Time (DT; 5 levels: 0–5 min, 5–10 min, 10–20 min, 20–80 min, and 80–120 min) on 26 constituents.
