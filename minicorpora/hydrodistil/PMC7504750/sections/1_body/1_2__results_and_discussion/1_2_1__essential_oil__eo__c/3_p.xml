<p>Interestingly and despite the expectation that grinding of the material prior to EO would speed up the EO extraction, most of the EO in the non-ground material eluted early in the distillation process, while most of the EO in the ground material was eluted later, in the 20â€“80 min DT (

 <xref rid="B25-molecules-25-03943" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], volatile fractions can be extracted relatively fast, while the EO in junipers is synthesized and accumulated in endogenous EO structures. The observed delay in EO extraction from ground biomass may be due to different physical and chemical processes developing during the grinding of the material in water, then introducing the slurry in the Clevenger apparatus before extraction. This postulation merits further investigation.
