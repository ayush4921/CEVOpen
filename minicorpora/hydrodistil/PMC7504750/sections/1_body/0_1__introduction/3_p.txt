0: Hemp production for high-value chemicals has recently amplified beyond anyones expectations [ 18], driven largely by the quickly established market for products infused with hemp or with hemp extracts such as CBD oil, which include terpenes.
1: The current environment of rigorous new product development with hemp extracts expanded the need and demand for hemp essential oil (EO) with differential chemical profile, aroma, and bioactivity [ 19, 20, 21, 22].
2: This can be achieved by either growing a large number of varieties and rely on their genetic and phytochemical differences, or by fractionating EO from a single variety during the EO extraction to obtain oils with desirable composition and aroma.
3: However, current use of hemp extracts and claims are ahead of science; decades of prohibiting research and development on hemp created a substantial knowledge gap on hemp terpenes.
4: Therefore, this research addressed the knowledge gap and the market needs.
5: The hypothesis of this study was that one can modify and obtain EO chemical profile with desirable composition and antimicrobial activity from a single hemp cultivar.
6: The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of distillation time and grinding of hemp before EO extraction on EO profile and antimicrobial activity.
