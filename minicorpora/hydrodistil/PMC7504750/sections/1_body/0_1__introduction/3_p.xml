<p>Hemp production for high-value chemicals has recently amplified beyond anyone’s expectations [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-25-03943" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], driven largely by the quickly established market for products infused with hemp or with hemp extracts such as ”CBD oil”, which include terpenes. The current environment of rigorous new product development with hemp extracts expanded the need and demand for hemp essential oil (EO) with differential chemical profile, aroma, and bioactivity [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-25-03943" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-25-03943" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-25-03943" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-25-03943" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This can be achieved by either growing a large number of varieties and rely on their genetic and phytochemical differences, or by fractionating EO from a single variety during the EO extraction to obtain oils with desirable composition and aroma. However, current use of hemp extracts and claims are ahead of science; decades of prohibiting research and development on hemp created a substantial knowledge gap on hemp terpenes. Therefore, this research addressed the knowledge gap and the market needs. The hypothesis of this study was that one can modify and obtain EO chemical profile with desirable composition and antimicrobial activity from a single hemp cultivar. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of distillation time and grinding of hemp before EO extraction on EO profile and antimicrobial activity.
