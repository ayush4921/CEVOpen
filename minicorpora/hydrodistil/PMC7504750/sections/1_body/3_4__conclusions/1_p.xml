<p>The results from this study confirmed the hypothesis; this study generated hemp EOs with greater diversity of mixture of terepenes and cannabinoids compared with the 17 commercially available hemp EO from a number of hemp cultivars. The highest concentrations of 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene and myrcene in the EO can be obtained in the 5–10 min DT of ground material or in the 80–120 min DT of nonground material. If high concentrations of 
 <italic>δ</italic>-3-carene and limonene are desirable, the EO can be obtained from 0–5 min DT fraction and the material is nonground. If higher concentration of the eucalyptol is desired, the EO can be sampled either in the 0–5 min DT of the ground material or in the 80–120 min nonground material. Overall, the highest concentrations of 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene, 
 <italic>α</italic>-(
 <italic>E</italic>)-bergamotene, (
 <italic>Z</italic>)-
 <italic>β</italic>-farnesene, 
 <italic>α</italic>-humulene, (
 <italic>α</italic>-caryophyllene), caryophyllenyl alcohol, germacrene D-4-ol, spathulenol, caryophyllene oxide, humulene epoxide 2, 
 <italic>β</italic>-bisabolol, 
 <italic>α</italic>-bisabolol, sesquiterpenes, and CBD can be obtained when EO is sampled in the 80–120 min DT and the material is nonground. Fractions of hemp EO with high concentration of 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene can be obtained by collecting the EO in the 80–120 DT. Monoterpenes in the hemp EO can be increased almost twofold to 85% by grinding the material before distillation and collecting the EO in the first 10 min. This is almost twice as high as their amount in the control EO (44.4%). Grinding increased the amount of monoterpenes in the EO. Sesquiterpenes can be increased up to 80% in hemp EO if the material if nonground and the EO is collected after 80 min DT. Sesquiterpenes concentration in the control EO were 46.9%. Grinding decreased the amount of sesquiterpenes in the EO fractions, while later sampling times increased it. Also, the concentration of 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene can be significantly increased by grinding of the material in water prior to distillation. Grinding resulted in slight be significant decrease in the CBD concentration of the EO (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-03943-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). Most of the CBD came out later in the distillation process; therefore, its highest concentration (5–6%) was in the 120–180 min DT fraction.
