<p>In a study of 
 <italic>H. officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>aristatus</italic> in Italy, Piccagli et al. [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-24-04047" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] identified three chemotypes: myrtenol (32.6%) and β-pinene (19.3%); β-pinene (24.7%) and eucalyptol (23.1%); and eugenol (43.9%) and limonene (15.9%). The results from our study showed that α-pinene (6.5%), sabinene (9.07%), and 
 <italic>cis</italic>-3-pinanone were also found in the combination of eucalyptol (55.9%) and β-pinene (7.53%). Therefore, our results suggest that the sampled population from Bulgaria belongs to a new chemotype of the species. A similar chemical composition of 
 <italic>H. officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>aristatus</italic> EO from Serbia was also previously reported [
