<p>Overall, the EO composition of the control (0–90) and the 0–5 min DT fraction were characterized by the highest specificity, as these EOs contained compounds (e.g., p-cymen-7-ol, perilla alcohol, 
 <italic>tau</italic>-cadinol, 
 <italic>tau</italic>-muurolol, manoyl oxide, 
 <italic>n</italic>-heneicosane, 
 <italic>n</italic>-docosane, 
 <italic>n</italic>-tricosane, 
 <italic>n</italic>-tetracosane, 
 <italic>n</italic>-pentacosane) not found in the other fractions. In this study, the highest concentration of eucalyptol was found in the 0–5 min DT fraction, demonstrating the usefulness of sequential extraction for obtaining EO with different and desirable chemical profiles. As mentioned, eucalyptol has extensive pharmacological activity and it is used against various diseases [

They are used as solvents, as a flavoring ingredients in foods, as a fragrance in industrial and household cleaners, soaps, lotions, and perfumes, and as a pesticide in pet sprays, dips, or shampoos [
