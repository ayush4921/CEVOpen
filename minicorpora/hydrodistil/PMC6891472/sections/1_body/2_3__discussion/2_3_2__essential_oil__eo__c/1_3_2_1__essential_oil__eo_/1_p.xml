<p>Forty three (43) constituents were identified in the 
 <italic>R. graveolens</italic> fruit EO. Ketones (including alkyl ketone) was the most abundant class. Aliphatic methyl ketones in 
 <italic>R. graveolens</italic> were reported for the first time more than a century ago by Williams [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-24-04047" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. During the process of distillation, the largest amount of ketones were extracted later in the distillation process, during the 60–90 min DT and also in the control (0–90 min DT). Some of the ketones (2-nonanone, 2-undecanone) were present in all EO fractions, however, the ratio between them varied. The highest concentration of 2-nonanone was found in the 30–60 and the 60–90 DT EO fractions. According to FAO and WHO [
