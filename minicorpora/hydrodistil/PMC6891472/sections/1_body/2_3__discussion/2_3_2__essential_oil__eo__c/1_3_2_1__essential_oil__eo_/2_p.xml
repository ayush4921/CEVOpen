<p>Other ketones (2-tridecanone and 2-decanone) were found in the control EO only. Also, 2-dodecanone, 2-undecanone, and 3-decanone were found in the control EO and in the 60â€“90 DT fractions (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-04047-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The differences in the concentration of ketones contributed to the differences in the EO composition of various fractions, confirming the hypothesis of this study. Ketones play important roles in plants and have commercial uses such as as ingredients in pheromones and natural insecticides in plants [
