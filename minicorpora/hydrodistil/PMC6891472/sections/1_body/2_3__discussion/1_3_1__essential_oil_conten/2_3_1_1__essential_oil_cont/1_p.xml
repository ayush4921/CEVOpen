<p>In this study, the fraction with the highest yield was obtained at the 30–60 min timeframe (0.12%), while the last fraction (60–90 min timeframe) had the lowest yield (0.03%). As noted in the introduction, phytochemical studies of the two species were most often performed on the whole aboveground plant parts. We did not find studies reporting 
 <italic>R. graveolens</italic> EO from fruits. According to the literature, the EO yield of aerial parts of 
 <italic>R. graveloens</italic> varies between 0.215% [

 <xref rid="B13-molecules-24-04047" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], depending on the plant organ (leaves, flowers, whole aboveground biomass), type of material (fresh or dried), and environmental factors. For instance, Fredj at al. [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-24-04047" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] obtained 0.3% oil yield from fresh leaves and 0.1% from fresh stems; Malik et al. [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-24-04047" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] obtained 0.32% from fresh leaves; Orlanda and Nascimento [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-24-04047" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] obtained 1.29% from fresh leaves; while the yield of EO from fresh aerial plant parts obtained by Haddouchi et al. [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-24-04047" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] was 0.18%. It is rather difficult to compare the oil yield from different plant parts reported in the literature, because EO yield may be a factor of both genetic and environmental factors, but also depends on postharvest handling and the EO extraction method.
