<p>In this study, the EO of 
 <italic>R. graveolens</italic> dried fruits and 
 <italic>H. officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>aristatus</italic> aboveground fresh biomass were sequentially extracted and characterized by GS-MS. The EO oil of both species was eluted asymmetrically during the distillation process, resulting in EO fractions with different weights. This is the first report on 
 <italic>R. graveolens</italic> and 
 <italic>H. officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>aristatus</italic> EO fractions eluted and collected in different timeframes subsequent to a grinding of the biomass to considerably accelerate the extraction process. Our results confirmed the hypothesis of this study.
