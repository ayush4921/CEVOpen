<p>The EO yield of the nonstop distillation control of 
 <italic>H. officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>aristatus</italic> biomass was 1.12%. A significant amount of the EO (0.44%) was eluted during the first 0–5 min DT, and the lowest (0.05%) during the 40–60 min DT. Therefore, our results suggest that the distillation if 
 <italic>H. officinalis</italic> could be significantly reduced from the reported 3 h DT in the literature [

 <xref rid="B25-molecules-24-04047" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] obtained 0.6% EO yield of air-dried plant material of 
 <italic>H. officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>aristatus</italic> (
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic> dry bases), whereas Piccaglia et al. [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-24-04047" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] obtained 0.2%, 0.3%, and 0.4% EO yield from steam-distilled fresh biomass of three different populations of the same species.
