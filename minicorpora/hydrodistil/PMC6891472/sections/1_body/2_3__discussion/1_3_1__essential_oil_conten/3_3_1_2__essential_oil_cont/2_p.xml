<p>The EO yields of 
 <italic>H. officinalis</italic> in this study were much higher than the ones reported in the literature. As mentioned, factors may influence the EO yield of 
 <italic>H. officinalis,</italic> such as harvest time and drying [

 <xref rid="B36-molecules-24-04047" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], year of the extraction [

 <xref rid="B38-molecules-24-04047" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], and the type of distillation. It is well known that hydrodistillation is more efficient than steam distillation. The results from this study support the concept of reducing energy consumption by controlling the DT.
