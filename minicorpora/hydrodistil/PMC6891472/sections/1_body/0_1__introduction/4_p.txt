0: The purpose of our study was to evaluate the hydrodistillation extraction kinetics of various EO constituents of  R. graveolens fruits and  H. officinalis subsp.
1: aristatus depending on their elution time.
2: Therefore, we captured and analyzed EO fractions at different timeframes.
3: The underlying hypothesis was that collection of the EO fractions collected at specific time frames will produce EOs with different composition that may have differential use by the EO industry.
