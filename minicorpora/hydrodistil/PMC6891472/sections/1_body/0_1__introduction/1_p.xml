 <italic>Ruta graveolens</italic> L. (Rutaceae) (common rue) is a tertiary relic, a medicinal plant naturally distributed along the Mediterranean coast, the Balkan Peninsula, and the Crimea [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-24-04047" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In Bulgaria, the natural populations of 
 <italic>R. graveolens</italic> are low density and have limited distribution. The species is protected by the Bulgarian Biodiversity Act (BBA), and included in the Red Data Book of Bulgaria [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-24-04047" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The chemical composition of 
 <italic>R. graveolens</italic> is of interest to chemists, pharmacists, and producers of medicinal herb preparations [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-24-04047" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-24-04047" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-24-04047" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Therefore, 
 <italic>R. graveolens</italic> has been either collected from natural habitats or cultivated as a high-value crop in the Mediterranean, North, Central, and South America, China, India, Middle East, and South Africa for a long time [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-24-04047" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Research has shown that the 
 <italic>R. graveolens</italic> plant contains mainly essential oil (EO) but also coumarins, alkaloids, and flavonoids [

 <italic>Ruta graveolens</italic> EOs and extracts have broad pharmacological activity. 
 <italic>R. graveolens</italic> products have shown various pharmacological activities such as antimicrobial and cytotoxic activity [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-24-04047" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], antibacterial activity [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-24-04047" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-24-04047" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], for treatment of eczema and psoriasis [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-24-04047" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]; amenorrhea; activity towards various pathogens; anti-inflammatory, cytotoxic, and antitumor activity [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-24-04047" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-24-04047" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Phytochemical studies of 
 <italic>R. graveolens</italic> were most frequently carried out on the entire aboveground biomass (leaves, stems, inflorescences) [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-24-04047" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-24-04047" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-24-04047" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Phytochemical analyses of the composition of the Ruta fruit EO were not found, although reports on the Ruta biomass EO do exist. 2-Undecanone and 2-nonanone were reported as the two major components of the EO of 
 <italic>R. graveolens</italic> aboveground biomass [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-24-04047" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-24-04047" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Also, Î±-pinene, limonene, and eucalyptol were identified as the main monoterpenes in 
 <italic>R. graveolens</italic> biomass EO [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-24-04047" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].
