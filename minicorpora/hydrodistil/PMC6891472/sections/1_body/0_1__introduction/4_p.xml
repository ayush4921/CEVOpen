<p>The purpose of our study was to evaluate the hydrodistillation extraction kinetics of various EO constituents of 
 <italic>R. graveolens</italic> fruits and 
 <italic>H. officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>aristatus</italic> depending on their elution time. Therefore, we captured and analyzed EO fractions at different timeframes. The underlying hypothesis was that collection of the EO fractions collected at specific time frames will produce EOs with different composition that may have differential use by the EO industry.
