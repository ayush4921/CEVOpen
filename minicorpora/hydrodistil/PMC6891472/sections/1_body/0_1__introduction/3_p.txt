0: Hyssopus officinalis subsp.
1: aristatus (Godr.)
2: Nyman (=  H. officinalis L. subsp.
3: pilifer (Pant.)
4: Murb.)
5: is a wild-growing taxon in Western Bulgaria, Znepol region, Vitosha, Predbalkan (Belogradchik) [ 23].
6: The range of this subspecies extends from Bulgaria and Northern Greece, northwest to Croatia [ 24].
7: Information on the phytochemical composition of  H. officinalis subsp.
8: aristatus and, in particular, the EO content is generally lacking.
9: Dzamic et al.
10: [ 25] identified 30 compounds in the oil of this species.
11: Previous research has shown that the main compounds of EOs were 1,8-cineole, -pinene,  cis-3-pinanone,  trans-pinocamphone, methyl eugenol, and limonene [ 25, 26, 27].
12: There were differences in the composition of hyssop oil depending on various factors such as geographic region, timing of sampling, postharvest handling, and extraction methodology [ 28, 29, 30].
13: The available data on the phytochemical constituents and extractions methods of  H. officinalis subsp.
14: aristatus are insufficient.
15: Overall, the traditional extraction techniques have a number of drawbacks, such as low extraction selectivity, toxic solvent residue in the final extract, and environmental pollution [ 14, 31].
16: Researchers have been developing environmentally benign extraction methods for EO, such as green extraction techniques [ 14].
17: The production of EO fractions over a given time interval has shown to save time and energy and generate EO fractions with unique profile [ 32].
