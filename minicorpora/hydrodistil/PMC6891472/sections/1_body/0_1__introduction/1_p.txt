0: Traditional medicine uses an impressive number of plant-derived natural products [ 1, 2].
1: Ruta graveolens L. (Rutaceae) (common rue) is a tertiary relic, a medicinal plant naturally distributed along the Mediterranean coast, the Balkan Peninsula, and the Crimea [ 3].
2: In Bulgaria, the natural populations of  R. graveolens are low density and have limited distribution.
3: The species is protected by the Bulgarian Biodiversity Act (BBA), and included in the Red Data Book of Bulgaria [ 4].
4: The chemical composition of  R. graveolens is of interest to chemists, pharmacists, and producers of medicinal herb preparations [ 5, 6, 7].
5: Therefore,  R. graveolens has been either collected from natural habitats or cultivated as a high-value crop in the Mediterranean, North, Central, and South America, China, India, Middle East, and South Africa for a long time [ 8].
6: Research has shown that the  R. graveolens plant contains mainly essential oil (EO) but also coumarins, alkaloids, and flavonoids [ 5, 9, 10, 11].
7: Ruta graveolens EOs and extracts have broad pharmacological activity.
8: R. graveolens products have shown various pharmacological activities such as antimicrobial and cytotoxic activity [ 6], antibacterial activity [ 12, 13], for treatment of eczema and psoriasis [ 14]; amenorrhea; activity towards various pathogens; anti-inflammatory, cytotoxic, and antitumor activity [ 15, 16].
9: Phytochemical studies of  R. graveolens were most frequently carried out on the entire aboveground biomass (leaves, stems, inflorescences) [ 12, 13, 17].
10: Phytochemical analyses of the composition of the Ruta fruit EO were not found, although reports on the Ruta biomass EO do exist.
11: 2-Undecanone and 2-nonanone were reported as the two major components of the EO of  R. graveolens aboveground biomass [ 13, 17].
12: Also, -pinene, limonene, and eucalyptol were identified as the main monoterpenes in  R. graveolens biomass EO [ 18].
