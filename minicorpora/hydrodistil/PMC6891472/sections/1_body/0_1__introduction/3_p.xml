 <italic>Hyssopus officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>aristatus</italic> (Godr.) Nyman (= 
 <italic>H. officinalis</italic> L. subsp. 
 <italic>pilifer</italic> (Pant.) Murb.) is a wild-growing taxon in Western Bulgaria, Znepol region, Vitosha, Predbalkan (Belogradchik) [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-24-04047" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The range of this subspecies extends from Bulgaria and Northern Greece, northwest to Croatia [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-24-04047" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Information on the phytochemical composition of 
 <italic>H. officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>aristatus</italic> and, in particular, the EO content is generally lacking. Džamić et al. [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-24-04047" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] identified 30 compounds in the oil of this species. Previous research has shown that the main compounds of EOs were 1,8-cineole, β-pinene, 
 <italic>cis</italic>-3-pinanone, 
 <italic>trans</italic>-pinocamphone, methyl eugenol, and limonene [

 <xref rid="B27-molecules-24-04047" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. There were differences in the composition of hyssop oil depending on various factors such as geographic region, timing of sampling, postharvest handling, and extraction methodology [

 <xref rid="B29-molecules-24-04047" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-24-04047" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The available data on the phytochemical constituents and extractions methods of 
 <italic>H. officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>aristatus</italic> are insufficient. Overall, the traditional extraction techniques have a number of drawbacks, such as low extraction selectivity, toxic solvent residue in the final extract, and environmental pollution [

 <xref rid="B31-molecules-24-04047" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Researchers have been developing environmentally benign extraction methods for EO, such as green extraction techniques [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-24-04047" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The production of EO fractions over a given time interval has shown to save time and energy and generate EO fractions with unique profile [
