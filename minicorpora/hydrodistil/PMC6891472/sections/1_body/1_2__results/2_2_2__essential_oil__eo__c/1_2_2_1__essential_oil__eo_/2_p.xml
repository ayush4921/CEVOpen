<p>Monoterpenes (acyclic, phenolic, monocyclic, bicyclic) were the most abundant chemical classes in the initial two DT fractions (0–5 min and 5–10 min) (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-04047-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Eucalyptol, α-terpineol, and terpinen-4-ol were the constituents with the highest concentration in the 5–10 min DT fraction, and were in much lower concentrations in the fractions obtained in the 10–30, 30–60, and in the 60–90 min DT fractions (

 <italic>trans</italic>-pinocarveol and nopinone came out in the first 30 min; these were below the detection limit in later fractions (
