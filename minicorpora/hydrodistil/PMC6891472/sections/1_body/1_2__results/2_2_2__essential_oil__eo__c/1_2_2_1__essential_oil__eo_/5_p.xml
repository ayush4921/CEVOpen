<p>In order to predict the concentration of EO compounds according to the DT, regression models were developed. The second-order polynomial (Equation (1)) model was the best to describe the relationship between DT and the concentrations of benzaldehyde, nonanal, and 2-undecanone (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-04047-f002">Figure 2</xref>). The Michaelis–Menten (Equation (2)) nonlinear regression model was the best for 2-nonanone (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-04047-f001">Figure 1</xref>), and β-caryophyllene, methyl undecanoate, α-caryophyllene, caryophyllene oxide, and eucalyptol (
