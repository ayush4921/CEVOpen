<p>Fatty alcohol and fatty acid ester were also found in the 
 <italic>R. graveolens</italic> fruit EO. The concentrations of these were higher in the 0–5 min and in the 10–30 min DT fraction. The 2-undecanol and 2-nonanol were the highest constituents of these fatty alcohols. The highest concentration of undecanol was found in the control EO (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-04047-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Fatty acid esters (ethyl decanoate, isopropyl tetradecanoate), phenolic acid ester (α-amyl-cinnamyl acetate), and straight-chain saturated hydrocarbon (

 <italic>R. graveolens</italic> fruit EO, came out in the highest concentration in the 30–60 min DT.
