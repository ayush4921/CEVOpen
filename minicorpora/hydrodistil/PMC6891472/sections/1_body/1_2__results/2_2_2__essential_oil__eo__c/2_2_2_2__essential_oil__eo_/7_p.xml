<p>The regression model that describes the relationship between DT and the concentration of each compound of 
 <italic>H. officinalis</italic> is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-04047-f003">Figure 3</xref>. The best regression models were Exponential decay (Equation (3)) for α-pinene and sabinene; and Power (convex) (Equation (4)) for eucalyptol, α-terpinolene, β-linalool, β-bourbonene, α-muurolene, and bicyclogermacrene. There was no regression model that describes the relationship between DT and 
 <italic>H. officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>aristatus</italic> EO yield and the concentrations of β-pinene, β-myrcene, 
 <italic>trans</italic>-pinocarveol, 
 <italic>cis</italic>-verbenol, pinocarvone, 
 <italic>cis</italic>-3-pinanone, terpinen-4-ol, cryptone, α-terpineol, verbenone, 
 <italic>trans</italic>-carveol, 
 <italic>cis</italic>-carveol, (-)-spathulenol, and caryophyllene oxide.
