<p>α-Pinene and sabinene came out also early in the distillation process and decreased gradually in the fractions later in the distillation; their concentrations were the highest in the 0–5 min and in the control oil (

 <italic>trans</italic>-pinocarveol seem to come out at the same speed throughout the distillation process and had highest concentrations in the control oil (
