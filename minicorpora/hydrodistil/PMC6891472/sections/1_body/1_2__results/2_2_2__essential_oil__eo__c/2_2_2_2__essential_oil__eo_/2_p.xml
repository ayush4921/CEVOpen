<p>Class monoterpenes (bicyclic, acyclics, phenolic monoterpenoids, monocyclic) were predominant compounds in the EO of 
 <italic>H. officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>aristatus</italic>. Monoterpenes came out early in the DT process. Therefore, the concentration of the monoterpenes increased progressively from the 0–5 min to reach the highest concentration in the 60–90 min EO fraction (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-04047-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>), and was the lowest in the control EO. Of the monoterpenes, the highest concentration had the subclass of bicyclic monoterpenes/monoterpenoids (α-pinene, sabinene, β-pinene, eucalyptol, 
 <italic>trans</italic>-pinocarveol, pinocarvone, 
 <italic>cis</italic>-3-pinanone, verbenone, 
 <italic>cis</italic>-verbenol, caryophyllene oxide) (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-24-04047">Suppl. Table S2</xref>). Of these, eucalyptol had higher concentration in the 0–5 min DT fraction (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-04047-t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>). The highest concentrations of 
 <italic>cis</italic>-3-pinanone were observed in the 10–20 and 20–40 min DT fractions.
