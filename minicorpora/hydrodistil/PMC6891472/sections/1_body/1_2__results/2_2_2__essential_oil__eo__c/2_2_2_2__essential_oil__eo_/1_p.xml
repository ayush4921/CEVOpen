<p>A total of 45 EO constituents were identified in all seven fractions of the 
 <italic>H. officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>aristatus</italic> oil (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-24-04047">Suppl. Table S2</xref>). The fractions differed with respect to the concentration of individual constituents. The EO constituents of 
 <italic>H. officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>aristatus</italic> in this study belonged to several different chemical classes: monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and straight-chain saturated hydrocarbons (
