<p>Class sesquiterpenes (monocyclic, bicyclic, tricyclic, tricyclic sesquiterpenoid) were the next class of compounds found in 
 <italic>H. officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>aristatus</italic> EO that reached the highest concentration in the control EO (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-04047-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). After the first five minutes distillation, the amount of sesquiterpenes decreased in the 60–90 DT fraction. Significant amounts of bourbonene, α-muurolene, bicyclogermacrene, and (-)-spathulenol were eluted in the 0–5 min DT, and were the highest in the control (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-04047-t010" ref-type="table">Table 10</xref>). α-Muurolene and bicyclogermacrene were characteristic of EO fractions obtained in the first 40 min (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-04047-t010" ref-type="table">Table 10</xref>). These EO ingredients were not identified in the other fractions.
