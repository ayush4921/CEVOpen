<p>Application of a sequential hydrodistillation method for the extraction of essential oils from 
 <italic>Ruta graveolens</italic> fruit and 
 <italic>Hyssopus officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>aristatus</italic> generated fractions with different yields and chemical compositions. In 
 <italic>R. graveolens</italic> EO, the yield was different in each fraction, while the highest yield was achieved in the 30–60 min fraction. The highest concentration of the major compounds 2-nonanone and 2-undecanone were found in the 30–60 min oil fraction and in Control, while eucalyptol was highest in the 5–10 min fraction. The fraction with the highest yield of EO of 
 <italic>H. officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>aristatus</italic> was 0–5 min. Eucalyptol, α-pinene, sabinene, β-pinene, and cis-
 <italic>3</italic>-pinanone were the major compounds. The highest concentration of eucalyptol was found in the 0–5 min fraction, β-pinene and 
 <italic>cis</italic>-3-pinanone content were highest in the 20–40 min oil fraction. The calculated kinetics regression models (Second-order polynominal, Michaelis–Menten, and Exponential decay, and Power) were able to describe the relationship and predict the concentration of the major compounds in 
 <italic>R. graveolens</italic> and 
 <italic>H. officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>aristatus</italic>.
