<p>The beginning of the distillation was recorded when the first EO drop was deposited in the collecting unit of the apparatus. The EO fractions were captured at different time frames: for 
 <italic>H. officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>aristatus,</italic> 0–5, 5–10, 10–20, 20–40, 40–60, 60–90 min, and 0–90 min nonstop control. The timeframes for 
 <italic>R. graveolens</italic> were 0–5, 5–10, 10–30, 30–60, 60–90 min, and a nonstop control of 0–90 min. There was no additional EO extracted after 90 min in both species. The eluted EO fractions were collected without interrupting the hydrodistillation process. Therefore, the EO fractions represented the eluted EO constituents within the specific timeframes. First, the oil was measured by volume, transferred into 2 mL vials, and kept in a freezer. Later, the EO was measured on an analytical scale following a separation from the remaining water. The EO samples were stored in a freezer until the time the samples were analyzed. In this study, we report the oil content (yield) based on weight.
