0: The beginning of the distillation was recorded when the first EO drop was deposited in the collecting unit of the apparatus.
1: The EO fractions were captured at different time frames: for  H. officinalis subsp.
2: aristatus, 05, 510, 1020, 2040, 4060, 6090 min, and 090 min nonstop control.
3: The timeframes for  R. graveolens were 05, 510, 1030, 3060, 6090 min, and a nonstop control of 090 min.
4: There was no additional EO extracted after 90 min in both species.
5: The eluted EO fractions were collected without interrupting the hydrodistillation process.
6: Therefore, the EO fractions represented the eluted EO constituents within the specific timeframes.
7: First, the oil was measured by volume, transferred into 2 mL vials, and kept in a freezer.
8: Later, the EO was measured on an analytical scale following a separation from the remaining water.
9: The EO samples were stored in a freezer until the time the samples were analyzed.
10: In this study, we report the oil content (yield) based on weight.
