<p>The collected material of 
 <italic>R. graveolens</italic> was dried at a shady, well-aerated environment. After drying, the 
 <italic>R. graveolens</italic> fruits were separated manually and gently from the biomass samples. The 
 <italic>Ruta</italic> fruits subsamples were generated randomly from each air-dried sample. Fresh 
 <italic>H. officinalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>aristatus</italic> samples were placed in a freezer until the essential oil isolation.
