<p>The GC-FID analysis of the EO was performed with a gas chromatograph 7890A gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, San Francisco, CA, USA) coupled to a flame ionization detector (FID) and HP-5 silica fused capillary column (30 m length × 0.32 mm i.d. × 0.25 µm film thickness). The oven temperature was programmed as mentioned above. The detector and injector temperatures were as follows: 280 °C and 220 °C. The carrier gas was helium at a flow rate of 1 mL/ min. Essential oil samples (1 μL) were injected using the split mode. The percentage composition of compounds (relative quantity) in the studied EO samples was calculated from the GC-FID peak areas using the normalization method, without correction factors.</p>
