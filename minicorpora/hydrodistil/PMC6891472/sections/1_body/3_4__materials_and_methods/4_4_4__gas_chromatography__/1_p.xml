<p>The composition of all essential oil samples in two replicates was carried out on a 7890A gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, San Francisco, CA, USA) interfaced with a 5975C mass selective detector (MSD). The individual compounds were separated using a HP-5 ms silica fused capillary column (30 m length × 0.32 mm i.d. × 0.25 µm film thickness). The oven temperature program used was 60 °C for 3 min, increased to 80 °C with 1 °C/min, held for 3 min, then rose with 5 °C/min to 280 °C for 5 min. The flow rate of the carrier gas (He) was maintained at 1.0 mL/min. The injection volume was one µl at split ratios 20:1 (Ruta samples) and 30:1 (Hyssopus samples). The temperatures of the ionization source, the quadrupole, and the injector were 230 °C, 150 °C, and 250 °C, respectively. The MSD was operated in full-scan mode. All mass spectra were acquired in electron impact (EI) mode with 70 eV. The constituents present in the EO samples were identified by comparing their linear retention indices (LRI) and MS fragmentation patterns with those from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST′08) and Adams mass spectra libraries [

 <sub>8</sub> to C
 <sub>36,</sub> under the same conditions described above.
