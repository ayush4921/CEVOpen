0: The GC-FID analysis of the EO was performed with a gas chromatograph 7890A gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, San Francisco, CA, USA) coupled to a flame ionization detector (FID) and HP-5 silica fused capillary column (30 m length  0.32 mm i.d.
1: 0.25 m film thickness).
2: The oven temperature was programmed as mentioned above.
3: The detector and injector temperatures were as follows: 280 C and 220 C. The carrier gas was helium at a flow rate of 1 mL/ min.
4: Essential oil samples (1 L) were injected using the split mode.
5: The percentage composition of compounds (relative quantity) in the studied EO samples was calculated from the GC-FID peak areas using the normalization method, without correction factors.
