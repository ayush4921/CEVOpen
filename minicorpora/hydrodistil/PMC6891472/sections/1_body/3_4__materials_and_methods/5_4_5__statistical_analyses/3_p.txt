0: For  R. graveolens, the most appropriate regression models that describe the relationships between DT and the concentrations of compounds were second-order polynomial (Equation (1)), MichaelisMenten (Equation (2)), and Exponential decay (Equation (3)).
1: For  H. officinalis, the regression models were Exponential decay and Power (convex) (Equation (4)).
2: (1)Y=0+1X+2X2+(2)Y=1X2+X+(3)Y=12(exp(3X))+(4)Y=1X2+ where  Y is the dependent (response) variable,  X is the independent (DT) variable, and the error term   is assumed to have normal distribution with constant variance.
