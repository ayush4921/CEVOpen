<p>While the second-order polynomial model (Equation (1)) is linear, the other three models (Michaelisâ€“Menten, Exponential, and Power) are nonlinear, and their parameters were estimated iteratively using the NLIN Procedure of SAS [

 <xref rid="B54-molecules-24-04047" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The figures as well as the second-order polynomial model fits were completed using Minitab 18 software (Minitab, State College, PA, USA).
