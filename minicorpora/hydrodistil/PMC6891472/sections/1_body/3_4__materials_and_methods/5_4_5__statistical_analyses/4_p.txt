0: While the second-order polynomial model (Equation (1)) is linear, the other three models (MichaelisMenten, Exponential, and Power) are nonlinear, and their parameters were estimated iteratively using the NLIN Procedure of SAS [ 53], and the fitted models met all adequacy requirements of nonlinear models [ 54].
1: The figures as well as the second-order polynomial model fits were completed using Minitab 18 software (Minitab, State College, PA, USA).
