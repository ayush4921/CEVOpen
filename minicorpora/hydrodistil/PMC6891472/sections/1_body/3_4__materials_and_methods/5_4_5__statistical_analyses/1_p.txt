0: The effect of distillation time (DT: 5, 10, 30, 60, 90, and Control (nonstop 090) min for  R. graveolens fruit; 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 90, and Control (nonstop 090) min for  H. officinalis) on essential oil (EO) yield and the concentration of constituents of  R. graveolens and  H. officinalis were determined using a one-way analysis of variance.
1: For  R. graveolens, the constituents were benzaldehyde, 2-nonanone, 2-nonanol, nonanal,  trans-pinocarveol, nopinone, terpinen-4-ol, -terpineol, 2-undecanone, 2-undecanol, 2-dodecanone, -caryophyllene, methyl undecanoate, -caryophyllene,  -cadinene, caryophyllene oxide,  tau-cadinol,  tau-muurolol, manoyl oxide, and eucalyptol.
2: For  H. officinalis subsp.
3: aristatus, the constituents were -pinene, sabinene, -pinene, -myrcene, eucalyptol, -terpinolene, -linalool,  trans-pinocarveol,  cis-verbenol, pinocarvone,  cis-3-pinanone, terpinen-4-ol, cryptone, -terpineol, verbenone,  trans-carveol,  cis-carveol, -bourbonene, -muurolene, bicyclogermacrene, (-)-spathulenol, and caryophyllene oxide.
