<p>For each EO yield and constituent (response variables), the validity of model assumptions was verified by examining the residuals as described in Montgomery [
 <xref rid="B52-molecules-24-04047" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Since the effect of DT was significant (
 <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05) on all response variables, multiple means comparison was completed using Tukeyâ€™s Multiple Range test at the 5% level of significance, and letter groupings were generated. The analysis was completed using the GLM Procedure of SAS [
