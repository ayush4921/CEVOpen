<p>The burden of fungal infections is alarming in the world: more than 10 million people have mucosal candidiasis and more than 150 million people have serious fungal diseases, which have a major impact on their lives or are fatal [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Mortality associated with a fungal disease is more than 1.6 million, similar to that of tuberculosis and over 3-fold more than malaria [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The major concern of fungal infections is the high rate of mortality associated with invasive fungal infections, which often exceeds 50% despite the availability of antifungal drugs [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This is due to the emergence of widespread drug resistance against antifungal agents that limits treatment options [
