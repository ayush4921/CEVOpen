0: Well diffusion assay for  Candida spp.
1: and  Cryptococcus spp.
2: was conducted according to M44-A Standard [ 19,  20].
3: Sabouraud's dextrose agar (SDA) media for yeast and potato dextrose agar were used for the subculturing of the A .
4: flavus [ 20,  21].
5: Mueller-Hinton agar supplemented with 2% glucose and 0.5  g/ml methylene blue dye medium was used for testing of  Candida spp.
6: and  Cryptococcus spp.
7: [ 20].
8: Nonsupplemented Mueller-Hinton agar was used for testing of the  A. flavus [ 21].
9: Fluconazole (0.25 mg/ml) was used as a positive control for  Candida spp.
10: and  Cryptococcus spp.
11: [ 22].
12: Amphotericin B (0.1 mg/ml) was used as a positive control for  A. flavus [ 21].
13: For the negative control, 1% DMSO was used [ 11].
14: After the inoculation of the organisms, 8 mm wells were created and filled with 100  l of different concentrations of essential oil.
15: Positive control (100  l) and negative control were also added [ 2].
16: All the plates were prepared in triplicate and incubated at 35C for 24 hours for  Candida spp.
17: and 48 hours for  Cryptococcus spp.
18: At the end of the incubation period, the diameter of the zone of inhibition in each of the inoculated plates was measured and the diameter of the well was subtracted to determine the antifungal activities of the essential oil [ 2,  11,  18].
