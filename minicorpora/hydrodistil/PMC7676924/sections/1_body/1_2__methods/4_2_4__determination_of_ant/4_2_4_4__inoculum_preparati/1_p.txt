0: The inoculum was prepared according to CLSI guidelines [ 23,  24]:  C. albicans,  C. glabrata,  C. neoformans,  C. parapsilosis ATCC 22019, and  C. krusei ATCC 6258 were subcultured on SDA media, while  A. flavus was subcultured on PDA media.
1: The inoculum was prepared from 24-hour-old colonies of  Candida species.
2: Approximately 1 mm diameter was suspended in 5 ml of saline and adjusted to 0.5 McFarland Standard.
3: For  Cryptococcus, the 72-hour-old colonies were suspended in 5 ml of saline and adjusted to 0.5 McFarland standards.
4: The prepared suspension was vortexed for 15 minutes and the cell density was adjusted to 0.5 McFarland standards.
5: This suspension was mixed for 15 seconds with a vortex, diluted to 1 : 50, and further diluted to 1 : 20 with RPMI medium to obtain the twofold test inoculum.
6: The (twofold) inoculum was diluted when the wells were inoculated [ 23].
7: For  A. flavus, the spores were harvested from 7-day-old cultures on PDA.
8: The saline was poured into the PDA slant and mixed with a sterile swab.
9: After 10 minutes of sedimentation, the suspension was transferred to a sterile test tube and adjusted to the 0.5 McFarland standards.
10: This suspension was further diluted to 1 : 50 (100  l of 0.5 McFarland Standard was added to 4.9 ml RPMI media); 100  l of the diluted was then added to the well [ 24].
11: The minimal fungicidal concentrations (MFCs) were determined by subculturing fungal isolates from the wells with no visible growth onto SDA plates.
12: The inoculated plates were incubated for 3 days at 35C.
13: MFC was the lowest concentration of drug that yielded a negative subculture [ 23,  26].
