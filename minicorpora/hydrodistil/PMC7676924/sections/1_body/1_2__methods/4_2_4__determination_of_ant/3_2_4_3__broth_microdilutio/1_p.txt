0: Broth microdilution was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC).
1: Sabouraud's dextrose agar (SDA) media were used to subculture yeast following the recommendation of international guidelines [ 23]; for  A. flavus, potato dextrose agar (PDA) media were used [ 21,  24].
2: The essential oil was prepared in serial dilutions in dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO).
3: 100 mg of  E. kebericho essential oil was measured and DMSO was added to 1 ml total solution forming 100 mg/ml.
4: Serial dilution was made in twofold dilution (1.56 mg/ml100 mg/ml).
5: Each serially diluted essential oil was further diluted in a ratio of 1 : 50 in RPMI media (100  l of stock solution was added to 4.9 ml of the RPMI), giving dilutions in the range of 0.03125 to 2 mg/ml.
6: 100  l from each dilution was filled in the 96-well plates in accordance with CLSI protocol.
7: The essential oil in the well was further diluted when the inoculum was added to the well to obtain dilutions in the range of 0.0156 mg/ml1 mg/ml [ 23].
8: Fluconazole and amphotericin B were used as standard drugs for yeasts and Aspergillus, respectively.
9: Twofold serial dilutions ranging from 0.25 to 128  g/ml for fluconazole and 0.031 to 16  g/ml for amphotericin B were used as a positive control; 1% DMSO was used as a negative control.
10: Quality was controlled by using quality control strains:  C. parapsilosis (ATCC 90018) and  C. krusei (ATCC 6258) [ 25].
11: The MIC was the lowest concentration that inhibited the visible growth of the fungi.
