0: The results were graphically presented as mean  SD.
1: Linear regression was used to determine the relationship between the concentration of the essential oil as an independent variable and zone of inhibition (response) as a dependent variable.
2: Two-way analysis of variance was used to compare the effect of treatment using EO on the test microorganisms and to examine the difference in MIC of essential oil at different concentrations and fluconazole for each test strain.
3: The independent variables were fungal strain and treatment (essential oil, fluconazole, and negative control).
4: p value<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
5: Statistical analysis was done using GraphPad Prism 5.01 software.
