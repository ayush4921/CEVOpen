<p>The enzymatic system of 
 <italic>P. polonicum</italic> was assayed to discover the pattern and mode of action of the hydrolysis capacity of the fungus in the presence and absence of essential oils (
 <xref rid="plants-10-00413-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The secretion of the fungal enzymes showed a declining pattern as the concentrations of both oils were increased. The response varied according to the enzyme, for example, FPase disappeared at 1% (clove) and 1.5% (caraway), despite this, the fungus still demonstrated some ability to grow at these concentrations. Furthermore, the fungus failed to show any xylanolytic activity, even at the lowest caraway concentration. The other enzymes (amylase, inulinase, invertase PGase, and protease) displayed various responses in their activities at 1.5% concentrations of both oils. At a 2% concentration of both oils, the whole enzymatic system was inhibited and no growth was detected.
