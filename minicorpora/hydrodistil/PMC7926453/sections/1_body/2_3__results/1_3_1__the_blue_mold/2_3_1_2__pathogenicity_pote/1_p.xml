<p>For the selection of the most severe blue mold isolate, a pathogenicity test was carried out on the three 
 <italic>P. polonicum</italic> isolates. All the isolates developed the typical symptoms of blue mold on the artificially infected tubers, while the non-inoculated control remained symptomless. Among the tested blue mold isolates, 
 <italic>P. polonicum</italic> ARS20 was the only fungal pathogen that recorded 100% disease severity at 25 °C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00413-f004">Figure 4</xref>). It was easily recognized by the presence of water leaching on the tuber after 5 days, later associated with a dense growth of white mycelium, and blue–gray mold spread rapidly, covering the entire tuber surface after about 10 days (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00413-f005">Figure 5</xref>). The other two 
 <italic>P. polonicum</italic> isolates, ARS21 and ARS22, came next, with disease severities of 89.5 and 87.0%, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a 
 <italic>P. polonicum</italic> pathogen on stored JA tubers in Egypt. The Koch’s postulates were considered in order to ensure the ability of various 
 <italic>P. polonicum</italic> isolates to develop the same disease symptoms on tubers.
