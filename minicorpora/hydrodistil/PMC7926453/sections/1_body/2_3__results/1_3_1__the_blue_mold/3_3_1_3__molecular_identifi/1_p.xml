<p>The selected fungal strain (
 <italic>P. polonicum</italic> ARS20) was characterized by the molecular technique of ITS as the perfect tool for identification. This technique compares the sequence that codes for the 18S rRNA gene after PCR amplification. From the Blast analysis, the strain ARS20 displayed high similarity with the formerly identified 
 <italic>P. polonicum</italic> on the GenBank-constructed phylogenetic tree of the RS20 isolate (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00413-f006">Figure 6</xref>). This is in line with previous morphological identifications. The GenBank accession number of the present fungal strain 
 <italic>P. polonicum</italic> ARS20 is MW041259.
