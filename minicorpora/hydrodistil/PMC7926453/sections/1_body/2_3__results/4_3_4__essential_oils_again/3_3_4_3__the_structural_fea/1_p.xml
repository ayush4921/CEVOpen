<p>The structural characteristics (dry matter, sprouting, and weight loss) of JA tubers as a response to CR and CL essential oils were measured (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00413-f011">Figure 11</xref>) under storage conditions, either in the presence or absence of 
 <italic>P. polonicum</italic> infection, as compared to the negative and untreated-infected control. The results revealed that the capability of CR and CL treatments to strongly reduce both sproutings and weight loss, in addition to a gradual increase in dry matter weight throughout the storage period being recorded, even in the presence or absence of the pathogen. Contrarily, over two monthsâ€™ storage, the presence of the pathogen caused a pronounced increase in sprouting and reduction in dry matter in the infected control, accompanied by a gradual increase in weight loss.
