<p>The infected JA tubers were treated with caraway and clove oils, and their impact on the blue mold—caused by 
 <italic>P. polonicum</italic> ARS20 development—was evaluated under storage conditions (
 <xref rid="plants-10-00413-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Under infection stress, a positive relationship was detected between the disease severity and the progress of the storage period. In this respect, the treatment of the infected tubers with CRP prohibited the appearance of disease symptoms caused by the tested pathogen. JA tubers treated with CLP came next in this respect, as compared to the untreated-infected control. Without artificial infection stress, storage JA tubers treated with CR or CL, completely prevented the appearance of any infection symptoms throughout the 4-month storage period, after which, the tubers had fully deteriorated. After two months of storage, there were dramatic variations regarding the development of the pathogen on the contaminated stored JA tubers (
