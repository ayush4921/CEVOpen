<p>During 2019 (November up to March at Ismailia, Dakahlia, and Cairo provinces, Egypt) survey of post-harvest diseases of cool-stored JA tubers, a significant economic loss caused by blue mold was observed. The initial symptoms of blue mold include sections of—or the entire tuber tissue—displaying a soft, watery, discolored appearance, followed by the emergence of a dense white mycelium, which, with age, rapidly becomes covered with bluish spores (
