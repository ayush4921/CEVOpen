<p>In addition to the health hazards of manufactured fungicides, the development of pathogen resistance is another problem. The fungicides of biological origin, such as essential oils, representing a promising alternative approach not only for controlling postharvest decay but also for delaying the natural deterioration of stored fruits [

Furthermore, essential oils represent ecofriendly, biodegradable, multifunctional, and nonpersistent natural products that reduce the risk of pathogen resistance build-up against chemicals because they contain two or more stereoisomers that target multi-sites on the pathogenâ€™s cell membrane [
