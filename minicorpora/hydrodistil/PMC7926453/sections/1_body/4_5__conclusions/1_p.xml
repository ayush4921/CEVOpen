<p>The blue mold; 
 <italic>P. polinicum</italic> was isolated and reported as a novel storage pathogen on JA tubers. The blue mold is caused by 
 <italic>Penicillium polonium</italic>, having a complementary active hydrolytic enzyme profile, and is capable of destroying JA tuber components. The blue mold was isolated from the infected tubers as the first recorded case on JA tubers. It is already widely known that essential oils are cheap and safe. This provides economic benefits and if they are replaced with fungicides, then another value-added economic benefit will be gained. Therefore, this study suggests an economic oil-based conservation procedure to preserve JA from blue mold, and maintain the nutritive value of JA tubers when under storage conditions. Under room temperature, such tubers could be protected by using caraway and clove essential oils, in descending order. The tuber survived under infection stress for up to 4 months without a significant deterioration in quality characteristics being observed. This suggests the potential to implement this ecofriendly oil-based preservation procedure on a larger scale.
