<p>Contrarily, the presence of an inducer substrate in the tuber components induces the synthesis of amylase, inulinase, invertase, and protease. These enzymes could also be constitutive. Such a complementary enzymatic system supports the observations of fungal survival under field and storage conditions. In addition to the enzymes described above, other accessory enzymes are required to cleave the linkage to side chains, i.e., side-chain cleaving enzymes, such as methyl esters and acetylation, or to split linkages to lignin [
