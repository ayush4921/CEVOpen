<p>Isolation of the blue mold pathogen was performed, applying Koch’s postulates to ensure the precise determination of the causal microorganism. Following isolation, analysis of the morphological and microscopic features represents the first and most basic route for fungal identification. Investigation of the three blue mold isolates showed that their characteristics were in accordance with
