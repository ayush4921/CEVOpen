<p>In order to ensure accuracy and confirmation, molecular identification is usually performed. This is highly sensitive and specific, with it being largely applied for the rapid identification of various fungi. The well-identified sequence—used for phylogeny creation—is fully annotated and shows a firm correlation with the other comparable fungal strains in the GeneBank database. Both ITS4 and ITS5 primers were used to amplify the nucleotide sequencing of the ITS region. This fragment region is uniform in a wide variety of fungal groups. This, in turn, aids in revealing the interspecific and, in some situations, intraspecific variation among organisms [

 <xref rid="B37-plants-10-00413" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], which is why such a region can be sufficient for fungal identification at the species level [
 <xref rid="B38-plants-10-00413" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Technically, the repeated or multi-copy feature of the rDNA makes the ITS regions easy to amplify from a tiny sample of DNA [
 <xref rid="B37-plants-10-00413" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Therefore, nucleotide sequencing of the ITS region is considered to provide quick and highly precise identification results compared to most other markers. Additionally, this can be used for barcode identification of a very broad group of fungi [
 <xref rid="B39-plants-10-00413" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Interestingly, the molecular identification of 
 <italic>P. polonicum</italic> ARS20 is in harmony with the morphological identification, with both identification methods confirming that the isolated blue mold (ARS20) is
