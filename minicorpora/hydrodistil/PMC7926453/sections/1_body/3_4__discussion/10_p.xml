<p>Xylanase (hemicellulose-degrading enzymes) manages the hydrolysis of xylan (the main part of the hemicellulose fraction). This process requires the combined action of various xylanases, including endo-1,4-β-xylanase; β-D-xylosidases; and acetylxylan esterase, resulting in the release of xylose monomers [
