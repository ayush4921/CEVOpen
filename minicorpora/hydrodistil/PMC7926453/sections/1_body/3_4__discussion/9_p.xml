<p>The mode of action of every CWDE has already been reported. FPase (the overall cellulolytic activity of cellulase enzymes) works on cellulose that is widely distributed in plant cell walls. The hydrolysis of cellulose is accomplished by components of cellulase, including randomly acting endoglucanse, two exoglucanases (cellodextrinases and cellobiohydrolases), and Î²-glucosidase, that completely degrade cellulose into glucose units [
