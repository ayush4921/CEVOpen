<p>During preservation, storage causes undesirable changes in the JA tubers. Storage usually results in high losses in quality, caused mainly by rotting, desiccation, sprouting, freezing, and inulin degradation. Concerning the disease severity, storage-fungi represent a serious problem, since plant infection takes place in the field and then extends to the storage [

However, both oils succeeded in greatly minimizing the deleterious action of the pathogen, likely due to the possible modes of action discussed above. Regarding the defense-related phytochemicals, peroxidase is a key enzyme in defense-related processes, including the accumulation of lignin and phenolic compounds and suberization. The polyphenol oxidase enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of phenols to quinines, which are substances that are highly toxic to the pathogen, while phenolic compounds contribute to resistance through their antimicrobial properties against the pathogen. The increase in these oxidative enzymes and the phenol content is associated with the increase in plant resistance against fungal infection [
