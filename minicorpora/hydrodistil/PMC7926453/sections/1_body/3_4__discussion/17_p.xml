<p>As discussed earlier, different CWDEs, such as cellulases, hemicellulases, pectinases, and proteases work together to crack up the plant cell walls for the entrance of a pathogen, therefore, this group ultimately works to degrade the outer part of the JA tubers. On the other side, there are other enzymes (amylase, inulinase, and invertase) that work on the degradation of the cell components. This latter group is expected to catalyze the degradation of sugar contents of the tuber. JA tubers are rich in inulin and various other sugars that represent a suitable substrate for these enzymes. Additionally, the tubers have a wide array of vitamins, minerals, and amino acids [
