0: For the in-vitro assessment of the activity of the essential oils against  P. polonicum, initially, each of the four essential oils was screened and evaluated.
1: Erlenmeyer flasks (250 mL), containing 50 mL sterilized potato dextrose (PD) broth medium and 0.5% Tween-20 were prepared.
2: After sterilization, each essential oil was separately added to flasks to cover a range of concentrations from 1 to 4% ( v/ v).
3: Flasks were inoculated using 1 mL of spore suspension (prepared from 5-days old culture grown on plates of PD agar at 28  2 C for 5 days and suspended in sterile saline (0.85%) to adjust the count to 106 spores/mL).
4: Then, the flasks were incubated in the dark at 28  2 C for 7 days.
5: An untreated medium was used as a control.
6: Triplicate flasks were used for each treatment.
7: At the end of the incubation period, the mycelial mats were harvested, washed several times with distilled water, and oven-dried to a constant weight at 70 C. The biological activity of oils was expressed as the growth percentage in the mycelial dry weight, in relation to the control (0% oil).
