0: Based on the antifungal screening test, caraway and clove oilsthe most effective against the growth of the fungal pathogenwere analyzed by a Gas Chromatography-Flame Ionization Detector (FID), using a DsChrom 6200 gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector and a column of BPX-5, 5% phenyl (Equiv.)
1: polysillphenylene-siloxane 30 m  0.25 mm ID  0.25m film with a sample size of 1 L. The temperature program ramp was increased at a rate of 10 C per min from 70 to 200 C. The detector temperature, FID, was 280 C. The carrier gas was at a flow rate of (mL/min) 30 (N 2):30 (H 2):300 (air).
2: The main compounds of the essential oils were identified by matching their retention times with those of the standard authentic samples injected under the same conditions.
3: The relative percentage of every compound was calculated from the area of the peak corresponding to each compound.
