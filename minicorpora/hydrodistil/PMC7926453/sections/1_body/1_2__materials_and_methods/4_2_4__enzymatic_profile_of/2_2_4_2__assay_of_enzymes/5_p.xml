<p>The released reducing groups by the previous enzymatic action were determined by the DNSA method [
 <xref rid="B24-plants-10-00413" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. With the aid of standard curves, the enzyme unit (U) was defined as the amount of enzyme required to release 1 Âµmol/mL/min of reducing-units of glucose (FPase and amylase), xylose (xylanase), an equimolar solution of glucose and fructose (inulinase and invertase), and polygalacturonic acid (PGase), under the test conditions.
