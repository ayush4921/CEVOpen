<p>Assays of filter paperase (FPase) and xylanase in the post-culture filtrate were performed using microcrystalline cellulose [
 <xref rid="B20-plants-10-00413" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and xylan [
 <xref rid="B21-plants-10-00413" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], respectively, as substrates. The substrates (0.5%) were individually dissolved in citrate buffer (0.05 M, pH 4.8), the reaction mixture (1 mL of the filtrate and 1 mL substrate-buffer solution) was incubated at 50 Â°C for 60, and 30 min, respectively.
