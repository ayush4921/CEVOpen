0: Assays of filter paperase (FPase) and xylanase in the post-culture filtrate were performed using microcrystalline cellulose [ 20], and xylan [ 21], respectively, as substrates.
1: The substrates (0.5%) were individually dissolved in citrate buffer (0.05 M, pH 4.8), the reaction mixture (1 mL of the filtrate and 1 mL substrate-buffer solution) was incubated at 50 C for 60, and 30 min, respectively.
