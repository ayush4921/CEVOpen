0: The proteolytic activity (protease) was quantitatively assayed in a reaction mixture of crude extract and casein as a substrate.
1: After incubation at 37 C for 10 min, free amino acids were separated by trichloroacetic acid [ 25], the released amino acids were measured at A280.
2: One U of protease activity was defined as the amount of the enzyme resulting in the release of 1 g of tyrosine equivalent/mL/min under the assay conditions.
