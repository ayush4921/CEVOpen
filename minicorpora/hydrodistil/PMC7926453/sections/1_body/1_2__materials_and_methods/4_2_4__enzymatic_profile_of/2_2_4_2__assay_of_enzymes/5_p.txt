0: The released reducing groups by the previous enzymatic action were determined by the DNSA method [ 24].
1: With the aid of standard curves, the enzyme unit (U) was defined as the amount of enzyme required to release 1 mol/mL/min of reducing-units of glucose (FPase and amylase), xylose (xylanase), an equimolar solution of glucose and fructose (inulinase and invertase), and polygalacturonic acid (PGase), under the test conditions.
