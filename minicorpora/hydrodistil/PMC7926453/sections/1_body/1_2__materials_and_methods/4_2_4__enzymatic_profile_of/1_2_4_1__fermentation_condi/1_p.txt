0: To explore the enzymatic profile of  P. polonicum in the presence of the most effective oils (caraway and clove), another fermentation trial was performed.
1: The fermentation procedure and the medium of [ 19] were used with some modifications.
2: Erlenmeyer flasks containing 50 mL of the medium were supplemented with one gram of ground cold-dried powder of  H. tuberosus tubers.
3: After sterilization, the medium was further supplemented with both oils at concentrations of 0.52.5%.
4: Then, the medium was inoculated with 1 mL of the previously-prepared spore suspension.
5: The batch fermentation was carried out in the dark under shaking conditions (200 rpm) at 28  2 C for 7 days.
6: After incubation, the mycelium was removed by centrifugation (5000 rpm for 20 min) and the culture filtrate was assayed for hydrolytic enzymes.
