0: An isolation trial was conducted from 15 decayed samples of JA tubers, stored under cool conditions.
1: Blue moldy JA tubers were washed with sterilized tap water and cut into sections with a sterilized scalpel.
2: Fifty pieces (approximately 1 cm long) of each sample were surface sterilized in 1% NaOCl for 3 min and 70% ethanol for 20 s and then rinsed with several changes of sterile distilled water.
3: Ten pieces of the sterilized tubers were plated out on potato dextrose agar medium (PDA) supplemented with an antibacterial agent (0.1 mg/l L-chloramphenicol and 0.3 mg/l streptomycin sulfate).
4: The plated Petri dishes were then incubated at 25  2 C for 5 days under dark conditions.
5: The recovered fungi were detected by examination of each JA piece under a stereoscopic binocular microscope (650).
6: The fungal habit characters were obtained and a light microscope was used for confirmation.
