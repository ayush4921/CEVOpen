0: The selected  P. polonicum ARS20 isolate was identified molecularly, by applying the molecular biological procedure of DNA isolation and amplification via the polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
1: DNA isolation and purification were performed using DNeasy Tissue Kits (QIAGEN-Germany), followed by determination of DNA concentration through comparing with standard lambda DNA on 1% ( w/ v) agarose gel.
2: Samples were then diluted to 20 ng DNA L and kept at 20 C.
