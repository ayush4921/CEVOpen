<p>Thermo-cycling PCR amplification was performed by Perkin-Elmer/GeneAmp
 <sup>®</sup> PCR System 9700 (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) programmed to fulfill 40 cycles (30 s each) after an initial denaturation cycle for 5 min at 94 °C. The annealing step was conducted at 45 °C for 30 s, and the elongation step was conducted at 72 °C for 30 s. The primer extension segment was extended to 7 min at 72 °C in the final cycle. Purification was accomplished to eliminate unincorporated PCR primers and dNTPs from PCR products using the Montage PCR Clean-up kit (Millipore).
