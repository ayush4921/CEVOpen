0: The three isolates of  Penicillium polonicum (ARS20, ARS21, and ARS22) were subjected to the pathogenicity test, which was conducted to determine the decaying potential of the fungal isolates.
1: Healthy-appearance tubers of Fuseau cultivar, obtained from the Vegetable Research Department, Horticulture Research Institute, Agricultural Research Center, Giza, Egypt, were washed and surface sterilized in 1% NaOCl for 3 min, then washed twice with sterile distilled water and left to dry.
2: Inoculation was carried out under sterilized conditions by making a small hole in the tuber using a sterile 5 mm cork-borer and inserting a 5 mm disc of a 5-day-old culture of the tested fungus in the hole.
3: Control tubers were treated in the same manner, except that an uninoculated disk of PDA was used.
4: Inoculated tubers were then stored individually in sterile humid plastic boxes at 25 C. Over 10 days, the artificially infected tubers with the three pathogenic isolates were investigated for rotting potentiality.
5: Twenty tubers were used for each isolate.
