<p>Healthy JA tubers were washed by water, surface disinfected in 1% NaOCl for 3 min, then rinsed in sterilized water and left to dry. Meanwhile, a 2% concentration of the selected essential oils (clove and caraway) was prepared. The inoculum of 
 <italic>P. polonicum</italic> was scaled up in a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask containing 50 mL of sterilized PD-broth medium inoculated with 1 mL (10
 <sup>6</sup> spores/mL), then incubated in the dark at 28 ± 2 °C for 10 days. The mycelial mat was then harvested and washed gently with sterile distilled water. Twenty grams of the fungal mat were mixed thoroughly and blended with distilled water (one liter). The resultant homogenized suspension was adjusted at 10
 <sup>6</sup> cfu/mL.
