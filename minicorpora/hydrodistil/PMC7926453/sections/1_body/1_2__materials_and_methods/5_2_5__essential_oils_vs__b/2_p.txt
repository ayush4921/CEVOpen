0: Six groups of tubers (15 kg each) were separated into (i) untreated control (C); (ii) untreated and infected by  P. polonicum (ARS20) pathogen (P); (iii) treated with caraway oil (CR); (iv) treated with clove oil (CL); (v) treated with caraway oil plus infection by  P. polonicum (CRP), and (vi) treated with clove oil plus infection by  P. polonicum (CLP).
