0: The effect of Variety (3 levels: Bonga 51/71, HT3/2002, and Dame) on % Curcuminoids, % Methanol extract, % EO yield and TPC, and the effect of Treatment (4 levels: Bonga 51/71, HT3/2002, Dame, and Control) on % DPPH scavenging capacity and IC 50 were determined using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).
1: The effects of Variety (3 levels: Bonga 51/71, HT3/2002, and Dame) and type of Extract (2 levels: essential oil and methanolic extract) on inhibition zone against  S. aureus were determined using two-way ANOVA.
2: Normal distribution and constant variance assumptions on the error terms were verified by examining the residuals as described in  Montgomery (2020).
3: Since the main effects of Variety and Treatment were significant on all response variables, multiple means comparison was completed using Duncan's method ( Montgomery, 2020) and letter groupings were generated at the 5% level of significance.
4: The analysis was completed using SAS version 9.4 software ( SAS, 2014).
5: Excel (in Microsoft Office, Microsoft, WA, USA) was used to produce the figures.
