0: To determine radical scavenging activity by DPPH method, 5% methanolic extract was prepared by adding turmeric powder (5 g) in methanol to make a 100 mL solution.
1: Briefly, between 0.05 and 0.4 mL of the extract was mixed with 2 mL of 0.1 mM 1, 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) in methanol.
2: The final solution was adjusted to 3 mL using methanol to produce different concentrations (16.00130.00  g/mL).
3: The %DPPH radical scavenging activity was calculated using the following equation: Scavengingcapacity(%)=(ADPPHAsADPPH)100where A DPPH is the absorbance of DPPH in the absence of a sample.
4: A s is the absorbance of DPPH in the presence of a sample.
