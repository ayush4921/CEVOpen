0: The agar disc diffusion method was used to check turmeric extracts' antibacterial activity as described in  Gupta et al.
1: (2015) with minor modifications.
2: In this study, antibacterial patterns were studied for different extracts of  C. domestica (rhizome) viz methanol extract (oleoresin) and aqueous extract (essential oil) for comparing three turmeric varieties.
3: The standard strains  Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923,  Salmonella typhimurium ATCC 25953, and  Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 used as test organism were obtained from collections of Ethiopian Biodiversity Institute, Addis Ababa.
4: Turmeric extracts were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (Sigma-Aldrich USA) to get 100 mg/mL concentration.
5: Sterile filter paper discs that have 8 mm diameter were impregnated with 50 l of diluted extract solution and then incubated for 15 min to ensure proper diffusion of the extract.
6: The serial dilution was then surface spread onto nutrient agar plates with 0.1 ml of bacterial culture standardized to 0.5 McFarland standards (1.5  10 8 CFU ml 1) and incubated at 37 C for 24 h. The inhibition zones' diameter was measured, and the mean value of three independent experiments (n = 3) was used in the statistical analysis.
7: The control discs contained DMSO only, and the standard antibiotic gentamycin (10 g/disc) was included in the assay as a positive control.
