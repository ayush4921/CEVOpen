0: Total curcuminoids content in each sample of  C. longa was performed as described in  Pothitirat and Gritsanapan (2006) with some modifications.
1: For the preparation of the standard solution, standard curcumin (100 mg) (cat # C-75300, purity >95%) was accurately weighed and transferred to a 100 mL volumetric flask.
2: The stock solution was prepared by adding methanol and adjusting to a final volume of 100 mL.
3: Then 2 mL stock solution was added to 25 mL volumetric flask, and the volume was made with methanol.
4: From this solution, concentrations of 1.6, 3.2, 4.8, 6.4 and 8.0 g/mL were prepared and used for the preparation of the calibration curve.
