0: The total polyphenol content (TPC) of the turmeric extracts was determined following the  Singleton et al.
1: (1999) procedure adopted by  Tanvir et al.
2: (2017) using Folin-Ciocalteu reagent.
3: Briefly, 5% methanolic extract was prepared by adding turmeric powder (5 g) in 70% methanol solution to make a 100 mL solution.
4: Then the solution was filtered through Whatman No.
5: 44 filter paper.
6: After filtration, 0.1 mL of the extract (0.5 mg/mL) was mixed with 2 mL of 7.5% sodium carbonate solution.
7: Then, 2.5 mL of 10-fold diluted Folin-Ciocalteu reagent was added, and then distilled water was added to make the solution 10 mL.
8: The resulting final reaction mixture was incubated for one hour in the dark.
9: The intensity of the blue-colored complex was measured at 765 nm using a JASCO V-630 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Corporation, Japan).
10: The TPC present was expressed as milligram of Gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/gram of extracts on a dry weight basis (DW) of plant material after plotting calibration curve for different concentrations (530 g/mL) of Gallic acid.
