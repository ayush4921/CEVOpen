0: The methanolic extract was prepared as described by  Green et al.
1: (2008), but with slight modifications.
2: Fifteen-gram grounded turmeric powder was put in a 1 L conical flask and aliquot of 250 mL of methanol (99%) was added, and the conical flask was covered with aluminum foil to minimize solvent loss through evaporation.
3: The mixture was then placed on a magnetic stirrer and extracted for six hours.
4: The extract was filtered by gravity when the extraction was completed.
5: The residue obtained from the filtration was re-extracted with 100 mL of ethanol for two hours.
6: Both filtrates were pooled together and concentrated in a rotary evaporator (Colen-Parmer, SB-1200) in a water bath set at 50 C. The obtained methanol extract was quantified, and the yield was calculated as a percentage (w/w).
