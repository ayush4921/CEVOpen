0: Essential oil components were determined for two of the varieties (Dame and Bonga 51/71) chosen based on their good previously analyzed quality parameters.
1: The analysis was conducted with Gas chromatograph (GC) of 890B series instrument (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA).
2: Then it was fitted with quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS) (Agilent 5977A MSD), and DB-5MS fused silica capillary column (30 m  0.25 mm [internal diameter film thickness 0.25 mm]).
3: Oven temperature was increased to 6075 C at 4 C/min; 75140 C at 7 C/min; 140145 C at 2 C/min; and 145270 C at 20 C/min.
4: Both auto-injector and detector temperatures were kept at 280 C; sample injection volume, 1 L; split ratio was 10:1.
5: The carrier gas was helium at a flow rate of 1 ml/min.
6: GC/MS (70eV) data were measured on the same gas chromatography coupled with MSD 5977.
7: The settings used were MS source temperature at 280 C, ion source temperature at 280 C, quadrupole temperature at 150 C, solvent delay of 3 min, and acquisition mode scan of 50550 amu.
8: The retention index was calculated using a homologous series of n-alkanes (C 8C 18).
