<p id="p0070">Essential oil components were determined for two of the varieties (Dame and Bonga 51/71) chosen based on their good previously analyzed quality parameters. The analysis was conducted with Gas chromatograph (GC) of 890B series instrument (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). Then it was fitted with quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS) (Agilent 5977A MSD), and DB-5MS fused silica capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm [internal diameter film thickness 0.25 mm]). Oven temperature was increased to 60–75 °C at 4 °C/min; 75–140 °C at 7 °C/min; 140–145 °C at 2 °C/min; and 145–270 °C at 20 °C/min. Both auto-injector and detector temperatures were kept at 280 °C; sample injection volume, 1 μL; split ratio was 10:1. The carrier gas was helium at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. GC/MS (70eV) data were measured on the same gas chromatography coupled with MSD 5977. The settings used were MS source temperature at 280 °C, ion source temperature at 280 °C, quadrupole temperature at 150 °C, solvent delay of 3 min, and acquisition mode scan of 50–550 amu. The retention index was calculated using a homologous series of n-alkanes (C
 <sub>8</sub>–C
 <sub>18</sub>).
