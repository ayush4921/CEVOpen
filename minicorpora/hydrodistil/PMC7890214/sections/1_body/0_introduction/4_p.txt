0: Although systematic production of  C. longa on a commercial scale started in Ethiopia in the 1970s ( Peethambaran et al., 2016), only three known turmeric varieties were released by Tepi National Spices Research Center since 2007.
1: This institution introduced Dame variety in 2007 and Bonga 51/71 and HT3/2002 varieties in 2018.
2: These varieties had been widely adopted in different parts of Ethiopia.
3: They were evaluated for yield (kg/ha) and some quality attributes of the rhizomes ( Kifelew et al., 2018;  Mekonnen and Garedew, 2019).
4: Other studies focused on the effects of harvesting stage ( Hailemichael et al., 2016) and postharvest operations ( Mariam et al., 2017) on quality attributes of Dame variety.
5: However, there is no study on the chemical composition and the essential and therapeutic values of turmeric varieties grown in Ethiopia.
6: Therefore, this study aimed to determine the chemical fingerprint of essential oils, abundance of curcumin and other extracts, antibacterial activities against strains of  E. coli,  S. aureus and  Salmonella typhimurium, total phenolic content, and DPPH free radical scavenging assay of turmeric varieties cultivated in Ethiopia.
