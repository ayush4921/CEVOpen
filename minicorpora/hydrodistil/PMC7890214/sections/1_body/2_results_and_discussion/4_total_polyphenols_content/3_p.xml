<p id="p0110">Total phenolic contents are essential constituents of plant materials that contribute to the functional quality (color, and flavor) and minimize molecular damage through quenching singlet oxygen and scavenging free radicals (

 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Sukati and Khobjai (2019)</xref> observed a significant positive correlation between TPC and 1/IC
 <sub>50</sub> values for DPPH, indicating the considerable contribution of phenolic compounds to these antioxidant assays. Moreover, the TPC of turmeric extracts can decrease when the extraction is performed with an aqueous methanol mixture. For example, 
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Nisar et al. (2015)</xref> reported that turmeric samples from Faisalabad, Pakistan extracted with 60 and 80% methanol in water showed TPC of 5.24 and 6.82 mg GAE/g, respectively. Similarly, 
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Sukati and Khobjai (2019)</xref> reported that turmeric rhizomes from Southern Thailand exhibited TPC of 19.79 mg GAE/g for aqueous extract and 23.69 mg GAE/g for 80% methanol extract. From these results, we postulate that the difference in TPC might be due to the solvent used in extraction, the variety, and the geographic area where the turmeric is cultivated.
