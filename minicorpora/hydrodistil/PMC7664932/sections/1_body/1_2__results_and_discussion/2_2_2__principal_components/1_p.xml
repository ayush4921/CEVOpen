 <xref rid="B31-molecules-25-05203" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] was separated from the other ecotypes, whereas the EOs from all organs (stem, leaf, fruit, and flower) were similar in the chemical composition. Furthermore, the EOs from these Egyptian samples were characterized by farnesyl acetone, myristic acid, and myristicin (
