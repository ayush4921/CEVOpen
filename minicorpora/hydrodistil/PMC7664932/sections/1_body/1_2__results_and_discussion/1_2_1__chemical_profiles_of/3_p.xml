<p>Chemical profiling of the two EOs exhibited the abundance of terpenoid compounds, including mono-, sesqui-, and diterpenes, as main components, in addition to hydrocarbons, aromatics, and carotenoid-derived compounds. The chemical characterization of EO components of Saudi 
 <italic>C. procera</italic> via GC-MS analysis revealed the abundance of sesquiterpenes (54.07%) that categorized to oxygenated sesquiterpenes (39.10%) and non-oxygenated sesquiterpenes (14.97%). Hinesol (13.50%) and 1,4-
