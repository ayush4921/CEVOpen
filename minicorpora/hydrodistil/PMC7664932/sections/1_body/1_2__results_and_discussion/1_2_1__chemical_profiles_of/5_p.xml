<p>Sesquiterpenes represent one of the principal components of terpenes of EOs and were basically established biosynthetically via the pathways of isoprenoid [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-25-05203" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In the plant kingdom, sesquiterpenes were found as main components of EOs from many plants such as 
 <italic>Lactuca serriola</italic> [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-25-05203" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], some 
 <italic>Launaea</italic> species [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-25-05203" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], 
 <italic>Eucalyptus camaldulensis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-25-05203" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], 
 <italic>Teucrium maghrebinum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-25-05203" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], some 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> species [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-25-05203" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], and others. In the present study, the EO of the Saudi plant exhibited a clear difference with the previously published profiles of different organs of Egyptian 
 <italic>C. procera</italic> [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-25-05203" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] as well as Indian 
 <italic>C. gigantea</italic> [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-25-05203" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, the Egyptian ecospecies exhibited consistency in the EO chemical composition, with these published data, where sesquiterpenes were identified as main constituents.
