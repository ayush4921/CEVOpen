0: The different concentrations (2.5, 1.25, 0.625, 0.312, 0.156, and 0.078 g mL 1) of EOs from Saudi and Egyptian ecospecies were mounted on a sterilized filter paper discs ( = 6 mm).
1: To test the antimicrobial activity, Petri plates were inoculated with 1  10 6 spores/mL of fungi (potato dextrose agar medium) and 1  10 8 colony forming units (CFU)/mL of bacteria (nutrient agar medium).
2: The discs with EO were placed in the center of the plates, and the plates were sealed with Parafilm  tape (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and incubated at 37 C for 24 h in case of bacteria and 28 C for 72 h in case of fungi.
3: After incubation, the diameter of inhibition zones was measured (mm) as an average of three different point measurements, as well as the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was calculated.
4: Gentamycin and amphotericin, at a concentration of 10 g mL 1, were used as positive controls for antibacterial and antifungal activities, respectively.
