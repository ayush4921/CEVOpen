<p>The different concentrations (2.5, 1.25, 0.625, 0.312, 0.156, and 0.078 µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) of EOs from Saudi and Egyptian ecospecies were mounted on a sterilized filter paper discs (∅ = 6 mm). To test the antimicrobial activity, Petri plates were inoculated with 1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> spores/mL of fungi (potato dextrose agar medium) and 1 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> colony forming units (CFU)/mL of bacteria (nutrient agar medium). The discs with EO were placed in the center of the plates, and the plates were sealed with Parafilm
 <sup>®</sup> tape (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h in case of bacteria and 28 °C for 72 h in case of fungi. After incubation, the diameter of inhibition zones was measured (mm) as an average of three different point measurements, as well as the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was calculated. Gentamycin and amphotericin, at a concentration of 10 µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>, were used as positive controls for antibacterial and antifungal activities, respectively.
