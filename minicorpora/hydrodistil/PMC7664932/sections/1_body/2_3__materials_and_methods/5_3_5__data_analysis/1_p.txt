0: The data of both allelopathic and antimicrobial activities were determined in triplicates, where they are subjected to ANOVA, followed by Duncans test using CoStat software program (version 6.311, CoHort Software, Monterey, CA, USA).
1: The significance of probability was adjusted at 0.05.
2: Furthermore, the data of IC 50 of the allopathic activity was subjected to a two-tailed  t-test via MS Excel (2016).
3: To assess the correlation among the studied  Calotropis ecotypes (Egyptian and Saudi) and those reported before (Egyptian [ 31], Nigerian [ 29, 30], Indian [ 28]), a matrix of the chemical compounds concentration percentage, derived from GC-MS analysis, was constructed.
4: The matrix has 136 identified chemical compounds from nine samples, including (i) present Egyptian shoot, (ii) present Saudi shoot, (iii) reported Egyptian stem collected from Nasr City [ 31], (iv) reported Egyptian leaf [ 31], (v) reported Egyptian fruit [ 31], (vi) reported Egyptian flower [ 31], (vii) reported Nigerian leaf collected from Riji region [ 29], (viii) Nigerian leaf collected from the market [ 30], and Indian flower [ 28].
5: The matrix was subjected to agglomerative hierarchical cluster (AHC) and principal component analysis (PCA) with XLSTAT statistical computer software package (version 2018, Addinsoft Inc., New York, NY, USA).
