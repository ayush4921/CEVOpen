0: The EOs of 200 g from the prepared plant samples were extracted by hydrodistillation from the shoots of Saudi and Egyptian  C. procera (two samples for each) via a Clevenger-type apparatus for three hours.
1: The apparatus has a 5000 mL round flask, filled with 2000 mL distilled water.
2: The oil layer was collected, water was removed using 0.5 g of anhydrous Na 2SO 4, and stored in a dark glass vial at 4 C till further analysis.
3: The yields of the extracted EOs were calculated via the equation: 100  (V/W); where V: volume of extracted EO, W: weight of the plant material used in extraction.
4: The chemical composition of the EO samples was analyzed separately by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) at the National Research Center, Giza, Egypt, as described in our previously documented work [ 11, 32].
5: The device consists of TRACE GC Ultra Gas Chromatographs (THERMO ScientificTM Corporate, Waltham, MA, USA) and Thermo Scientific ISQTM EC single quadrupole mass spectrometer.
6: The GC-MS system is equipped with a TR-5 MS column with dimensions of 30 m  0.32 mm internal diameter (i.d.
7: ), 0.25 m film thickness.
8: At a flow rate of 1.0 mL min 1, helium was used as carrier gas with a split ratio of 1:10.
9: The temperature program was 60 C for 1 min, rising by 4.0 C min 1 to 240 C and held for 1 min.
10: A diluted sample in hexane (1 L) at a ratio of 1:10 ( v/ v) was injected, and the injector and detector were held at 210 C. Mass spectra were recorded by electron ionization (EI) at 70 eV, using a spectral range of  m/ z 40450.
11: The identification of the EO chemical components was performed via Automated Mass spectral Deconvolution and Identification (AMDIS) software, Wiley spectral library collection, NIST library database (Gaithersburg, MD, USA; Wiley, Hoboken, NJ, USA), retention indices relative to  n-alkanes (C 8C 22), or appraisal of the mass spectrum with authentic standards.
