0: The allelopathic activity of the EOs extracted from Egyptian and Saudi  C. procera samples were examined against two weeds,  B. pilosa and  D. aegyptium.
1: The seeds of  B. pilosa were collected from a garden of Mansoura University, Egypt (310236.5 N 312112.3 E), while the seeds of  D. aegyptium were collected from a field newly reclaimed near Gamasa City, northern Egypt (312705.4 N 312744.2 E).
2: The uniform seeds were chosen, surface sterilized with sodium hypochlorite (0.3 N), and dried.
3: The bioassay was conducted according to Abd El-Gawad [ 13], where serial concentrations of the EOs (25, 50, 75, and 100 L L 1) were prepared using 1% Tween   80 (Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany).
4: In a Petri plate, 20 sterilized seeds were spread over a sterilized Whatman  Grade 1 filter paper, and immediately 5 mL of each concentration or Tween 80 as a positive control.
5: Fiver plates were performed per each treatment and the plates were sealed with Parafilm  tape (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and incubated in a growth chamber at 25  2 C. After 5 and 7 days of incubation for  B. pilosa and  D. aegyptium, respectively, the germinated seeds were counted and the lengths of seedling roots and shoots were measured in mm.
6: The inhibition of seed germination, seedling root, and the seedling shoot was calculated as follows: Inhibition (%)=100(No/Length of controlNo/Length of tretamnet)No/Length of control
