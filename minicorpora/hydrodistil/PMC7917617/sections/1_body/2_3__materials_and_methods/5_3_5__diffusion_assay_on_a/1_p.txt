0: As recommended by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS manual), the antimicrobial activity of EOs of the investigated plants was assayed by the diffusion method.
1: The tested bacterial strains were:  E. faecalisATCC 51299,  E. faecalis (Vancomycin-resistant Enterococci, VRE),  S. epidermidisATCC 12228,  S. aureusATCC 43300,  S. aureus (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA) 43300,  S. typhimuriumATCC 14028,  A. baumannii, (Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, CRE)ATCC 19605,  S. sonnei25931,  K. pneumonia (Extended spectrum beta-lactamases, ESBL)ATCC 700603,  K. pneumonia (CRE)ATCC 1705,  P. aeruginosa,  Proteus mirabilisATCC 43071, and  E. coliATCC 35218.
2: Above acronyms are as follows: ATTC: American Type Culture Collection;  VRE: Vancomycin-resistant Enterococci; MRSA: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus; ESBL: Extended spectrum beta-lactamases; CRE: Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae.
3: Each bacterial strain was suspended in MuellerHinton Broth and adjusted to 0.5 McFarland scale turbidity.
4: The surface of MullerHinton agar plates was swabbed in three directions with standard inoculum, using sterile cotton swabs.
5: The plates were allowed to dry for 10 min before 3-mm wells were cut into the MullerHinton agar using sterile plastic pipettes.
6: Then, the wells were filled with 20 L and 30 L of EO dissolved in DMSO at the rate of 1/10  v/v, since the EO of  Lavandula pubescens was the only active one, the test was repeated by using the pure major constituent carvacrol at the concentration of 10 mg/mL in dimethyl sulfoxide (20 mg of carvacrol was dissolved in 2 mL of DMSO), 30 L per well (corresponding to 300 g per well), with vancomycin (30 g disc) as a positive control for Gram-positive bacterial strains while amikacin (30 g disc) and ciprofloxacin dissolved in DMSO with the rate 1000 g/1000 L (30 g per well) were used as a positive control for Gram-negative bacterial strains; furthermore, dimethyl sulfoxide was used as a negative control.
7: All plates were incubated at 37 C for 24 h under aerobic conditions.
8: After the incubation period, the plates were examined, and the diameter of each inhibition zone was measured.
