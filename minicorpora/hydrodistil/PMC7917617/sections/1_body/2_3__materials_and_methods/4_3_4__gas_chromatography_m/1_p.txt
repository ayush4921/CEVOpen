0: Gas chromatography-electron impact mass spectrometry (GC-EIMS) analyses were performed with an Agilent 7890B gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with an Agilent HP-5MS (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) capillary column (30 m  0.25 mm; coating thickness 0.25 m) and an Agilent 5977B single quadrupole mass detector (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA).
1: The oven temperature program was set to rise from 60 C to 240 C at 3 C/min.
2: Temperatures were set as follows: injector temperature, 220 C; transfer-line temperature, 240 C. The carrier gas was He, at 1 mL/min flow.
3: The acquisition was performed with the following parameters: full scan, with a scan range of 35300  m/z; scan time: 1.0 s; threshold: 1 count.
4: The identification of the constituents was based on the comparison of their retention times (t R) with those of pure reference samples and of their linear retention indices (LRIs), which were determined relatively to the t R of a series of  n-alkanes (C9C25).
5: The detected mass spectra were compared with those listed in the commercial libraries NIST 14 and ADAMS, as well as in a homemade mass-spectral library, built up from pure substances and components of EOs of known composition and MS literature data [ 44, 50].
