0: MICs and MBCs of  L. pubescens EO, carvacrol, ciprofloxacin, and vancomycin hydrochloride were determined with the broth micro-dilution method, with sterile 96-well microtiter plates for the determination of the MIC and MBCs of the tested samples.
1: All samples were dissolved in DMSO, with exception of vancomycin hydrochloride which was dissolved in water.
2: Basically, the first column in microtiter plates contained 200 L of EO, carvacrol, or antibiotics and the other subsequent wells contained 100 L of MuellerHinton broth.
3: EO, carvacrol and antibiotic were serially diluted by transferring 100 L to the next well to produce serial dilutions.
4: MuellerHinton broth (100 L containing the bacteria 0.5 McFarland) was added to each well containing 100 L of the tested EO, carvacrol or antibiotics.
5: Sterilized MuellerHinton broth alone was used as the negative control, and bacterial broth with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was only used as control.
6: The microdilution plates were incubated at 37 C overnight.
7: The MIC was determined by selecting the lowest concentration of sample that completely inhibited the growth of the organism and compared with the growth control ( Table 4).
8: Wells with no visible growth in MIC were sub-cultured using 10 L of the selected wells and placed on MullerHinton agar plates.
9: The MBC was determined by taking 10 L of the selected column and placing it on the MuellerHinton agar plates as well.
10: All plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 C and the colony forming units (CFUs) were counted.
11: MIC was determined by selecting the lowest concentration of the tested sample that completely inhibited the visible growth of a microorganism after overnight incubation in the well.
12: The MBC was defined as the lowest concentration of the sample that prevents any growth of an organism after being sub-cultured on the MuellerHinton agar plate [ 9].
