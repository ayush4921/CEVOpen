0: Essential oils (EOs) have numerous commercial applications due to their diverse biological properties and appealing fragrances.
1: The global market thus supports a wide variety of pharmaceutical products such as gels, creams, ointments, nano-emulsions, and patches [ 8, 9, 10, 11].
2: Besides their exceptional antimicrobial effects, they also possess a wide range of pharmacological properties, including, for example, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, anti-parasitic, anticancer and antioxidant activity [ 12, 13, 14, 15, 16].
3: The use of EOs in therapy has increased in recent times due to the rise in multidrug-resistant bacteria and the high costs of new generation antibiotic drugs [ 17].
4: The chemical nature of essential oils hinders the process of microbial resistance, since they are very complex mixtures of constituents with different structures, including monoterpenes [ 18], sesquiterpenes [ 19], diterpenes [ 20], sulfur-containing compounds [ 21, 22], phenylpropanoids [ 20], alkaloids [ 23], and phenols [ 24].
5: This large variety of chemical structures means that no single enzyme is able to deactivate all of these compounds.
6: Thus, EOs may represent an open frontier for advances in medicine and pharmaceutical sciences.
