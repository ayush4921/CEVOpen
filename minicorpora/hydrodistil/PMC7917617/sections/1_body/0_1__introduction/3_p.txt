0: The flora of Saudi Arabia is very rich and variable due to environmental diversity, ranging from extreme arid desert to high mountains with high rainfall rates.
1: These variations affect plant metabolism in terms of secondary metabolite chemistry and biological activity.
2: In fact, some Saudi plants have been found to exhibit substantial chemo-diversity from the same plants grown in other countries and climates [ 25, 26, 27].
3: The aim of this study was to investigate the chemical composition of hydrodistilled EOs from different organs of three aromatic plant species collected in Saudi Arabia and to find valuable sources of antimicrobial agents against common pathogenic microorganisms.
4: These were the aerial parts of  Lavandula pubescens Decne.
5: and  Pulicaria incisa subsp.
6: candolleana E.Gamal-Eldin, as well as leaves, stems, ripe and unripe fruits of  Juniperus procera Hochst.
7: Ex Endl.
