 <italic>,</italic> 36 compounds were detected. Its EO was rich in oxygenated monoterpenes, accounting for 64.2% of the whole oil, with linalool (33.0%), chrysanthenone (10.3%), and 
 <italic>cis</italic>-chrysanthenol (8.0%) as the main constituents. Phenylpropanoids represented the second most abundant class, with eugenol (8.9%) as the sole representative compound. The class of non-terpene derivatives accounted for 8.7%, including mainly (
 <italic>Z</italic>)-jasmone (4.7%) and isopentyl 2-methylbutanoate (2.6%). Only one previous study reported the composition of the EOs of 
 <italic>P. incisa</italic> ssp. 
 <italic>candolleana</italic> collected in Egypt, with carvotanacetone (66.01–50.87%) and chrysanthenone (13.26–24.3%) as the most representative components, of which the latter was also present in a significant percentage (10.3%) in our sample. EOs hydrodistilled from this Egyptian sample showed antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, as well as against some fungi, among which 
 <italic>Streptococcus pneumonia</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>Syncephalastrum racemosum</italic> were the most sensitive strains [
