<p>VOC composition of 
 <italic>Soo</italic> has been analyzed, and their antimicrobial and lipase enzyme activities investigated for the first time. Limonene was the major compound of allextracts (SPME, SPMEs of EO, 
 <italic>n</italic> -hexane, and methanol extracts) obtained from fresh 
 <italic>Soo</italic> within the range of 41.7% to 76.5%, respectively. However, 
 <italic>α</italic> -methoxy- 
 <italic>p</italic> -cresol (52.9%) was found to be a major component only in the SPME of the methanol extract of the plant. This clearly showed that various extraction methods used in this work resulted in the identification of different components as in the literature. 
 <italic>n</italic> -Hexanal was the major compound obtained in EO of fresh 
 <italic>Soo</italic> . Aldehydes were found to be the major class of components (88.6%) in the EO. The amount of limonene and 
 <italic>α</italic> -methoxy- 
 <italic>p</italic> -cresol is so high that 
 <italic>Soo</italic> could be a source for the production of these compounds. In general, the greatest activity of EO was against 
 <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> with 79.5 µg/mL MIC value. According to the agar diffusion method, the most antimicrobial activity was observed against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria in methanol extract, which had better antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic>P. Aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> with 19-mm and 21-mm inhibition zones, respectively. The MIC values were found to be 489.6 µg/mL and 121.4 µg/mL, respectively. The EO of the 
 <italic>Soo</italic> was found to be most effective against the lipase enzyme (59.87 µg/mL, IC 
 <sub>50</sub> ). Therefore, the overall results of antimicrobial and lipase enzyme activities suggest that EO and solvent extracts of 
 <italic>Soo</italic> may be promising prospects for pharmaceutical, food, and other industrial applications. In further study, activity guided isolation and purification could be carried out on 
 <italic>Soo.</italic>
