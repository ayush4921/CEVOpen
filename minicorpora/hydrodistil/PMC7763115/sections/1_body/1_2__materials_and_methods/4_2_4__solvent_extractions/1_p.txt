0: The fresh plant (120 g) was ground into small pieces using a plant mill.
1: Blended material was weighed (40 g each sample) into 3 different flasks (100 mL) and extracted 3 times with analytical-grade  n -hexane, methanol, and water solvents (25 mL  3; 12 h each).
2: After the suction filtration, the same extracts were combined and evaporated at 40 C to produce crude  n -hexane (0.0445 g) and methanol (0.7356 g) extracts.
3: The water extract was lyophilized to produce crude water extract (0.2470 g).
