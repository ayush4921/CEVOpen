0: The antimicrobial properties of EO,  n -hexane, methanol, and water extracts of  Soo were investigated quantitatively in respective broth media by using double microdilution; the minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) values (g/mL) were examined [37,38] and used in our previous work [25,26].
1: The antibacterial and antifungal assays were carried out in MuellerHinton broth (MH) (Difco Laboratories Inc.) at pH.
2: 7.3 and buffered yeast nitrogen base (Difco Laboratories Inc.) at pH 7.0, respectively.
3: The microdilution test plates were incubated for 18 h at 35 C. Brain heart infusion broth (BHI) (Difco Laboratories Inc.) was used for  M. smegmatis , and incubated for 4872 h at 35 C. The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration that showed no growth.
4: Ampicillin (10 mg/mL), streptomycin (10 mg/mL), and fluconazole (2 mg/mL) were used as standard antibacterial and antifungal drugs, respectively.
5: The 1/10 dilution of each solvent was used as a control.
