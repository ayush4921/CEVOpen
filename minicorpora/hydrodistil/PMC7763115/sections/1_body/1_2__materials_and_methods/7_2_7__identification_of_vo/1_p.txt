0: Retention indices of the volatile components of  Soo were determined by the Kovats method using  n -alkanes (C  6 C  32 ) as standards [2327].Volatile compounds were identified by comparison with literature RI [2836]and MS, compared to existing analytical standards, and by matching mass spectral libraries (NIST, Wiley7NL, FFNSC1.2, and W9N11).
