<p>All test microorganisms were obtained from the Hıfzıssıhha Institute of Refik Saydam (Ankara, Turkey) and were as follows: 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> ATCC35218, 
 <italic>Yersinia pseudotuberculosis</italic> ATCC911, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> ATCC43288, 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> ATCC29212, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> ATCC25923, 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> 709 Roma, 
 <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic> ATCC607, 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> ATCC60193, and 
 <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> RSKK 251. The antimicrobial screening test using the agar-well diffusion method as adapted was used earlier [37,38]. Each microorganism was suspended in brain heart infusion (BHI) broth (Difco Laboratories Inc., Detroit, MI, USA) and diluted to approximately 106 colony forming units (cfu) per mL. They were flood-inoculated onto the surface of BHI agar and Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) (Difco Laboratories Inc.), and then dried. For 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> , SDA was used. Five-millimeter–diameter wells were cut from the agar using a sterile cork-borer, and 50μL of the extract substances was delivered into the wells. The plates were incubated for 18 h at 35 °C. Antimicrobial activity was evaluated by measuring the zone of inhibition against the test organism. Extract stock solutions were prepared at different concentrations (10,000–155,400 μg/mL) according to the amount of material obtained. A 1/10 dilution of each solvent was used as a control.
