0: All test microorganisms were obtained from the Hfzsshha Institute of Refik Saydam (Ankara, Turkey) and were as follows:  Escherichia coli ATCC35218,  Yersinia pseudotuberculosis ATCC911,  Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC43288,  Enterococcus faecalis ATCC29212,  Staphylococcus aureus ATCC25923,  Bacillus cereus 709 Roma,  Mycobacterium smegmatis ATCC607,  Candida albicans ATCC60193, and  Saccharomyces cerevisiae RSKK 251.
1: The antimicrobial screening test using the agar-well diffusion method as adapted was used earlier [37,38].
2: Each microorganism was suspended in brain heart infusion (BHI) broth (Difco Laboratories Inc., Detroit, MI, USA) and diluted to approximately 106 colony forming units (cfu) per mL.
3: They were flood-inoculated onto the surface of BHI agar and Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) (Difco Laboratories Inc.), and then dried.
4: For  C. albicans , SDA was used.
5: Five-millimeterdiameter wells were cut from the agar using a sterile cork-borer, and 50L of the extract substances was delivered into the wells.
6: The plates were incubated for 18 h at 35 C. Antimicrobial activity was evaluated by measuring the zone of inhibition against the test organism.
7: Extract stock solutions were prepared at different concentrations (10,000155,400 g/mL) according to the amount of material obtained.
8: A 1/10 dilution of each solvent was used as a control.
