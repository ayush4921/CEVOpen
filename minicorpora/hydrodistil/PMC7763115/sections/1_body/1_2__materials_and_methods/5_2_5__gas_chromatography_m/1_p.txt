0: EO analysis was carried out using a Shimadzu QP2010 ultra GC-FID/MS, Shimadzu 2010 plus FID fitted with a PAL AOC-5000 plus auto sampler, and Shimadzu Class-5000 Chromatography Workstation software (Shimadzu Corp., Kyoto, Japan).
1: The separation was analyzed by means of a Restek Rxi-5MS capillary column (30 mm  0.25 mm  0.25 m) (Restek Corp., Bellefonte, PA, USA).
2: The essential oil injections to GC-FID/MS wereperformed in split mode (1:30) at 230 C. The essential oil solution (1 L) in  n -hexane (HPLC grade) was injected and analyzed with the column held initially at 60 C for 2 min and then increased to 240 C with a 3 C/min heating ramp.
3: The oven program was as follows: the initial temperature was 60 C for 2 min, which was increased to 240 C for3 min; the final temperature of 250 C was held for 4 min.
4: Helium (99.999%) was used as the carrier gas, with a constant flowrate of 1 mL/min.
5: Detection was implemented in electronic impact mode (EI); ionization voltage was fixed at 70 eV and scan mode (40450  m/z ) was used for mass acquisition.
6: Each sample was analyzed and the mean of each reported.
