0: EO,  n -hexane, methanol, and water extracts of the  Soo species studied were evaluated for lipase (PPL) inhibitory assay by the modified method, using  p -nitrophenyl butyrate (  p -NPB) as the substrate [3941].
1: First, all fractions were dissolved with buffer solution (0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH = 8.0) in 25, 50, 100, and 200 g/mL concentrations.
2: Orlistat, used as a positive control, was prepared in 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 g/mL concentrations.
3: The test procedure was designed as I, II, III, and IV wells, described as follows: I, 90 enzyme solution (crude porcine PL type II, 200 units/mL), 5 L substrate solution (10 mM  p -NPB in acetonitrile), 5 L buffer solution (0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH = 8.0); II, 90 L enzyme solution, 10 L buffer solution; III, 90 L enzyme, 5 L sample solution, 5 L substrate solution; IV, 90 L enzyme solution, 5 L sample solution, 5 L buffer solution.
4: The plates were incubated at 37 C for 15 min.
5: Following incubation, substrate solution (10 mM  p -NPB in acetonitrile) was added to each well.
6: The plates were incubated at 37C for 15 min, and the absorbance of the reaction mixture was determined spectrophotometrically at 405 nm in a 96-well microplate using a spectrophotometer (SPECTROstar Nano, BMG LABTECH Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
7: Each sample was tested in triplicate.
8: The percentage of PPL inhibitory effect was calculated using the following equation:
