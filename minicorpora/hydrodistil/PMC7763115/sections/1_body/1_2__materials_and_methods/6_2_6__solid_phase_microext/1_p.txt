0: The blended fresh plant (2 g),  n -hexane (0.0241 g), methanol (0.3802), and water extracts (0.1450) of  Soo were placed into a sealed SPME vial (10 mL) with a silicone-rubber septum cap, then submitted to a solid-phase microextraction device (Supelco Inc., Bellefonte, PA, USA).
1: A DVB/Carboxen/PDMS coating fiber was used to obtain volatile components.
2: The SPME fibers were conditioned for 5 min at 250 C in the GC injector.
3: Extraction was achieved with magnetic stirring at 80 C using an incubation time of 5 min and an extraction time of 10 min.
4: Fibers with extracts of volatile compounds were subsequently injected into the GC injector.
5: GCFID/MS analysis was performed using a Shimadzu QP2010 Ultra mass selective detector attached to the 2010 Plus chromatograph.
6: The carrier gas used was helium, at a flow rate of 1 mL/min.
7: The injection was performed in split mode (1:30) at 230 C. Samples were analyzed and the results recorded.
8: The temperature, incubation, and extraction times were set according to the reported experiment [22].
