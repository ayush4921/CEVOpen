<p>SPME GC-FID/MS analysis for the fresh plant and solvent extract ( 
 <italic>n</italic> -hexane, methanol, and water) of 
 <italic>Soo</italic> revealed 7, 12, 7, and 4 natural compounds totaling 99.7%–99.9%. Limonene (76.6%, 41.8%, and 61.6%) was found to be the major compound in the SPME of the fresh plant and the SPMEs of the 
 <italic>n</italic> -hexane and methanol extracts of 
 <italic>Soo</italic> , respectively. SPME of the water extract revealed 
 <italic>α</italic> -methoxy- 
 <italic>p</italic> -cresol (52.9%) as the main component. Limonene is widely used as a flavor and fragrance additive in perfumes, beverages, and cleaning products [43]. Considering its medicinal potential and cosmetic uses, it is important that 
 <italic>Soo</italic> might be a good source for limonene. Monoterpenes (76.6% and 61.3%) werethe major constituent in the SPME of the fresh plant and the SPME of methanol extract. Aldehydes and aromatic compounds accounting for 57.4% and 52.9% of the SPMEs of 
 <italic>n</italic> -hexane and water extracts respectively were the most abundant constituents (Table 1). Major constituents were found to be limonene (76.5%, 41.7%, 61.3%), pelargonaldehyde (7.0%, 21.5%, and 12.3%), undecanal (3.2%, 15.1%, and 4.2%), and heptanal (10.4% and 7.9%) in the SPMEs of 
 <italic>n</italic> -hexane and methanol extracts, respectively. 
 <italic>α</italic> -methoxy- 
 <italic>p</italic> -cresol (52.9%) and limonene (45.3%) were the most abundant constituents of the SPME of the water extract.
