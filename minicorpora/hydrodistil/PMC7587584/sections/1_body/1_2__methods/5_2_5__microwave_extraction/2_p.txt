0: Solvent-free microwave extraction of essential oil from  Origanum vulgare L. was performed by Bayramoglu and co-workers [ 42].
1: The effects of microwave power and extraction time on the yield and composition of the product were investigated.
2: Solvent-free microwave extraction of  Origanum vulgare L. was compared with conventional hydrodistillation in terms of process time, yield, composition and physical properties of the essential oil obtained.
3: Significantly higher essential oil yields were attained by solvent-free microwave extraction at higher power levels compared to conventional hydrodistillation.
4: Required extraction time decreased significantly, whilst the compositions of the essential oil obtained by both methods were similar.
5: Thymol (650750 mg/mL) was identified as the major aroma compound.
