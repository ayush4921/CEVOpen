0: Water has been proved as a proficient extraction solvent for the isolation of phenolic acids, including chlorogenic, vanillic, gallic, cinnamic, coumaric, ferulic and caffeic acid.
1: In addition, chrysin, epicatechin, naringenin, catechin, kaempferol, quercetin, rutin, luteolin-7- O-glucoside, apigenin-7- O-glucoisde, rosmarinic acid and luteolin were also identified in the water extracts of various oregano species [ 25].
2: Chloroform [ 26], phosphate buffer [ 27] and acetone in mixtures with water and organic solvents have also been applied [ 28].
3: Reports have shown that flavones are among the most abundant subgroup of flavonoids in the extracts of oregano species followed by flavonols, flavanones and flavanol.
4: The principal components of flavonoids and phenolic compounds may vary considerably in different oregano species.
5: Additionally, geographical and environmental factors have been demonstrated as the key parameters determining the flavonoid and phenolic acids profile of chemotypes within the same species.
6: Verbascoside has been identified in the water extract of the  Lippia citriodora species [ 29], whilst caffeic acid, lithospermic acid and rosmarinic acid were present in the water extract of  Majorana hortensis attained under the same process conditions [ 30].
7: Gallic acid, caffeic acid, 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde,  p-coumaric acid and rosmarinic acid were present in the water extract of  Origanum acutidens [ 31].
