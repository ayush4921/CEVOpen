0: The traditional methods of essential oil distillation are steam and hydrodistillation.
1: Solidliquid extraction, using solvents, such as methanol, ethanol and acetone is utilized for the extraction of antioxidants from plant matters.
2: The extraction method and the extraction conditions can affect the chemical composition of the essential oils [ 10].
3: These effects need to be considered according to the application of essential oils [ 11].
4: Hydrodistillation is among the oldest extraction techniques for the isolation of essential oils.
5: Long extraction times, which could lead to the hydrolysis of some heat-sensitive components, and complicated control of process parameters, which may consequence in inadequate extract composition, are the main disadvantages of the method.
6: Therefore, researchers are chasing alternatives to this extraction principle [ 12].
7: The application of supercritical fluids as an extraction media could offer a solution to this issue.
8: Indeed, according to the results of the evaluation and comparison of the chemical profile of essential oils of marjoram ( Origanum majorana) and oregano ( Origanum vulgare) obtained by hydrodistillation and supercritical CO 2, both essential oils presented similar chemical profiles.
9: Cis-sabinene hydrate was determined as the major compound in the essential oil obtained by supercritical extraction with CO 2, whilst terpinen-4-ol was present as the main compound in the essential oil obtained by hydrodistillation.
10: Supercritical CO 2 extraction gave a higher yield of essential oils compared to hydrodistillation and the concentrations of oxygenated monoterpenes were higher without significant differences between fractions.
