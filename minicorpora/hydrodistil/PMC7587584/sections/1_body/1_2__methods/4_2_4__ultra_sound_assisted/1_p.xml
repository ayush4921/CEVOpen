<p>Microwave-assisted extraction is simply a combination of microwave heating and a conventional extraction method such as solvent extraction and hydrodistillation. Power ultrasound induces phenomena in the medium, such as acoustic streaming and cavitation, which leads to intense agitation and mass transfer enhancement. Ultrasound-assisted extraction techniques therefore accelerate the release of the essential oils from aromatic plants as they facilitate the penetration of the solvents in the plant material [

These collapse sharply by producing mechanical forces, as well as local high temperatures and pressure at ambient conditions. Such behavior allows the release and dissolution of intracellular materials like essential oils. One of the recent applications of ultrasound is as part of the intensification of the supercritical fluid extraction of high added value compounds, such as antioxidants and essential oils. Ultrasound-assisted supercritical fluid extraction to obtain extracts rich in phenolic compounds with antioxidant capacity from dry oregano has been reported [

Whilst an increase in the total phenolic content and increments in the antioxidant capacity of the extracts has been observed, the flavonoid profile of the extracts was not altered. As the extraction yields of supercritical fluid extraction can be low, the use of ultrasound is an efficient way to improve mass transfer mechanisms and the kinetics [
