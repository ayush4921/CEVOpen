0: Microwave-assisted extraction is simply a combination of microwave heating and a conventional extraction method such as solvent extraction and hydrodistillation.
1: Power ultrasound induces phenomena in the medium, such as acoustic streaming and cavitation, which leads to intense agitation and mass transfer enhancement.
2: Ultrasound-assisted extraction techniques therefore accelerate the release of the essential oils from aromatic plants as they facilitate the penetration of the solvents in the plant material [ 39].
3: Cavitation involves the formation, expansion and growth of small liquid-free zones or bubbles.
4: These collapse sharply by producing mechanical forces, as well as local high temperatures and pressure at ambient conditions.
5: Such behavior allows the release and dissolution of intracellular materials like essential oils.
6: One of the recent applications of ultrasound is as part of the intensification of the supercritical fluid extraction of high added value compounds, such as antioxidants and essential oils.
7: Ultrasound-assisted supercritical fluid extraction to obtain extracts rich in phenolic compounds with antioxidant capacity from dry oregano has been reported [ 40].
8: Whilst an increase in the total phenolic content and increments in the antioxidant capacity of the extracts has been observed, the flavonoid profile of the extracts was not altered.
9: As the extraction yields of supercritical fluid extraction can be low, the use of ultrasound is an efficient way to improve mass transfer mechanisms and the kinetics [ 41].
10: Ultrasound has therefore been proposed as a tool of increasing the yield or to decrease the extraction time by compression/decompression, acoustic streaming and cavitation phenomenon.
