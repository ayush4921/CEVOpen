0: However, techniques employing high-resolution mass spectrometry are still under intense examination, thus the data on identification of the phenolic profile by high-resolution mass spectrometry are still relatively limited.
1: These methods, comprising linear ion trap (LIT) mass spectrometrywhich provides single stage mass analysis that supplies molecular mass information, tandem mass analysis (MS/MS) and multi-staged tandem mass spectrometry (MS n) that provide structural informationhave been demonstrated as a reliable tool for the structural elucidation of unknown compounds in complex mixtures such as the total plant extracts.
2: Flavonoids in the oregano extracts were analyzed using a high-pressure liquid chromatography-diode array detection-electrospray ionization/mass spectrometry (HPLC-DAD-ESI/MS) screening method [ 45].
