0: High resolution and the ability to provide precise and accurate qualitative and quantitative data established gas-chromatography (GC) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS), i.e., GC-MS analyses as a valuable means for taxonomic research of plants.
1: Several phenolic compounds have been found in plant materials using different detectors, such as the coulometric, electrochemical and photodiode arrays, as well as ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry and low-resolution mass spectrometry [ 44].
