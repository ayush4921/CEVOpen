<p>Some studies report on steam distillation to obtain essential oil from different species. As the steam rises through the container holding the plants, it causes the oil membranes to open, releasing the essential oils. This process prevents the membrane that surrounds the oil from bursting, which ruins the oil. The oil evaporates and is taken with the steam up through the tube attached at the top of the container. To our knowledge, there are no studies connected to oregano oleoresin extraction and fractionation to separate antioxidant compounds. The chemical composition of the essential oils was analyzed via GC-MS technique and carvacrol and 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene were identified as the major compounds and additionally, according to the MIC test results, the oregano and savory essential oil showed a perfect antimicrobial activity against 19 test microorganisms with a MIC value of &lt;0.195 Âµg/mL [
