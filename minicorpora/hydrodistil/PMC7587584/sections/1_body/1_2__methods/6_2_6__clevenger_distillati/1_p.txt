0: Some studies report on steam distillation to obtain essential oil from different species.
1: As the steam rises through the container holding the plants, it causes the oil membranes to open, releasing the essential oils.
2: This process prevents the membrane that surrounds the oil from bursting, which ruins the oil.
3: The oil evaporates and is taken with the steam up through the tube attached at the top of the container.
4: To our knowledge, there are no studies connected to oregano oleoresin extraction and fractionation to separate antioxidant compounds.
5: The chemical composition of the essential oils was analyzed via GC-MS technique and carvacrol and  p-cymene were identified as the major compounds and additionally, according to the MIC test results, the oregano and savory essential oil showed a perfect antimicrobial activity against 19 test microorganisms with a MIC value of<0.195 g/mL [ 43].
