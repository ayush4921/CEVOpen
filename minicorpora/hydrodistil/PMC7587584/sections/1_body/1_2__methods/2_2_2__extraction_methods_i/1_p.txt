0: Supercritical fluid extraction using carbon dioxide or subcritical water as a solvent meet the safety and environmental requirements and are therefore considered as clean and benign processes.
1: Over steam distillation or conventional organic solvent extraction, extraction involving sub- and supercritical fluids, features several advantages.
2: This includes the elimination of the organic solvents and the residue in the products and the capability to use lower temperatures, leading to less deterioration of the thermally-labile components in the extract.
3: Supercritical fluid extraction of oregano leaves is suggested to concentrate and isolate antioxidant extracts to be used as functional food ingredients.
4: Namely, the technique is suitable to retain the organoleptic characteristics of the starting spice materials.
5: Compressed carbon dioxide yields a high-quality extract at a competitive cost.
6: The pretreatment of the herbaceous matrices, the extraction pressure and temperature and the solvent flow rate [ 35] are among the main process parameters that affect the extraction kinetics and extract composition.
7: In that sense, the extraction process has been evaluated in terms of both the quality and the activity of the antioxidant products obtained.
8: Supercritical fluid extraction is also frequently more selective than extraction with commonly used solvents which extract unwanted components (e.g., tannins, chlorophyll and minerals).
9: Some authors have reported on the supercritical extraction of oregano leaves to obtain oregano essential oil and oleoresin [ 36].
