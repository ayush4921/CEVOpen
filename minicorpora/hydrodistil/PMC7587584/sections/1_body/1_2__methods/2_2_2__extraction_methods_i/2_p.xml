<p>Subcritical water extraction has been utilized for the extraction of medically and commercially important phenolic compounds from food and food byproducts. Subcritical water extraction uses water at elevated pressures and temperatures to extract compounds of different polarities. Adjusting the water polarity is an additional advantage of this technique, which is achieved by changing the system temperature. The tuneability of operating conditions and consequent high selectivity of subcritical water extraction enables the handling of the composition of the extracts by varying the operating conditions and has therefore been used for essential oil isolation as well as for antioxidant extraction [

 <xref rid="B37-molecules-25-04735" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], subcritical water extraction has been utilized for the extraction of nutraceuticals with antioxidant activity from oregano. The selectivity of the process has been investigated based on applying different operating conditions for the extraction of antioxidants from oregano leaves. Subcritical water extraction has been performed at different temperatures (25, 50, 100, 150 and 200 °C). The highest extraction temperature, 200 °C, gave the extracts of the highest antioxidant activity (EC50 equal to 10 μg/mL) and also the highest extraction yield (54% dry weight). Their contribution moreover strongly supports the theory that different temperatures involve extraction of different type of compounds.
