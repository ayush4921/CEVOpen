<p>The most relevant constituents of the essential oils are volatile. That fact needs to be considered in the research of functional packaging materials to obtain an efficient method of incorporation. Recent research is oriented towards the development of active packaging that simultaneously provides protection against oxidation and microbial deterioration of food products [
