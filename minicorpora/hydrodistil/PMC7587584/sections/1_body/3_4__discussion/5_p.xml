<p>Fasseas et al. [
 <xref rid="B113-molecules-25-04735" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>] investigated the antioxidant activity in meat treated with oregano. The results indicated that the essential oil treatments decreased the oxidation, while the heat treatment and storage time significantly affected the antioxidant activity of the meat [

 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> has been evaluated in patients infected with enteric parasites such as 
 <italic>Blastocystis hominis</italic>, 
 <italic>Entamoeba hartmanni</italic>, and 
 <italic>Endolimax nana</italic>. In 7 out of 11 patients that were positive for 
 <italic>Blastocystis hominis</italic>, improvement was observed [

 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> and 
 <italic>Origanum compactum</italic> have shown a mild effect in vitro on
