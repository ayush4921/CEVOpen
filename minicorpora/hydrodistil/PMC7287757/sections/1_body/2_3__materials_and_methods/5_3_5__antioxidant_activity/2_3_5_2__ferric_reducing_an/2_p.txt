0: A 1 mL sample of the essential oil at different concentration (25100 g/mL, diluted in Mmethanol) was added to 3 mL of FRAP reagent (corresponding to 1 mL 0.2 M sodium phosphate buffer pH 6.6, 1 mL 1% potassium ferricyanide solution, 1 mL 10% ( v/ v) trichloroacetic acid TCA).
1: After centrifugation at 3000 g for 10 min, the supernatant was recovered and mixed with 1.5 mL distilled water and 150 L 0.1% FeCl3.
2: The absorbance of the mixture of essential oil and FRAP at 700 nm was then measured using a UVVis dual-beam spectrophotometer (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA).
3: The absorbance of ascorbic acid and Trolox were also measured using this method, for positive control.
4: A higher absorbance indicates a greater reducing power.
