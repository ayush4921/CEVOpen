<p>A 1 mL sample of the essential oil at different concentration (25–100 μg/mL, diluted in Mmethanol) was added to 3 mL of FRAP reagent (corresponding to 1 mL 0.2 M sodium phosphate buffer pH 6.6, 1 mL 1% potassium ferricyanide solution, 1 mL 10% (
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) trichloroacetic acid TCA). After centrifugation at 3000 g for 10 min, the supernatant was recovered and mixed with 1.5 mL distilled water and 150 μL 0.1% FeCl3. The absorbance of the mixture of essential oil and FRAP at 700 nm was then measured using a UV–Vis dual-beam spectrophotometer (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). The absorbance of ascorbic acid and Trolox were also measured using this method, for positive control. A higher absorbance indicates a greater reducing power.
