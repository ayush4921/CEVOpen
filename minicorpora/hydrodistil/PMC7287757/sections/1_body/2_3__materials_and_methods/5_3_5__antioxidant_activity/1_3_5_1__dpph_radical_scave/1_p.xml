<p>The antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> essential oils was determined by DPPH radical scavenging activity. The experimental procedure was performed using the method described by Bicas et al. (2011) [
 <xref rid="B82-molecules-25-02400" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>] and modified as reported by Nea et al. (2019) [
 <xref rid="B68-molecules-25-02400" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. The absorbance was measured at 517 nm using an Ultrospec 7000 UV–Vis dual beam spectrophotometer (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). Both Trolox and ascorbic acid were used as positive standards. The scavenging percentage of the DPPH radical was calculated as described in the following formula, 
 <disp-formula>% scavenging of DPPH radical = [(A
  <sub>blank</sub> − A
  <sub>sample</sub>)/A
  <sub>blank</sub>] × 100
 </disp-formula> where A
 <sub>blank</sub> is the absorbance of the reaction media without the essential oil and A
 <sub>sample</sub> is the absorbance of the test sample. These assays were performed in triplicate and the results were expressed as mean ± SD.
