0: The antioxidant activity of  L. camara essential oils was determined by DPPH radical scavenging activity.
1: The experimental procedure was performed using the method described by Bicas et al.
2: (2011) [ 82] and modified as reported by Nea et al.
3: (2019) [ 68].
4: The absorbance was measured at 517 nm using an Ultrospec 7000 UVVis dual beam spectrophotometer (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA).
5: Both Trolox and ascorbic acid were used as positive standards.
6: The scavenging percentage of the DPPH radical was calculated as described in the following formula,  % scavenging of DPPH radical = [(A  blank  A  sample)/A  blank]  100  where A blank is the absorbance of the reaction media without the essential oil and A sample is the absorbance of the test sample.
7: These assays were performed in triplicate and the results were expressed as mean  SD.
