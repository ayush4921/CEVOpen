<p>The multivariate analysis of the essential oil samples from 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> was carried out by submitting the quantitative data of chromatographic analysis to the PCA (principal component analysis). The proportion of components in the essential oils from 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> was used to define an m × n matrix, where m is the samples and n is the compounds in the essential oil. The cumulated data corresponded to the samples collected in Bregbo and consisted of 82 individuals (82 samples) and 84 variables (84 identified compounds). Among the 84 compounds in the table of data, only those containing less than 40 zero values and having a percentage of the total quantity ≥ 0.02 were selected for the PCA. The PCA and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) were performed by “R 3.6.0 software”.
