0: The multivariate analysis of the essential oil samples from  L. camara was carried out by submitting the quantitative data of chromatographic analysis to the PCA (principal component analysis).
1: The proportion of components in the essential oils from  L. camara was used to define an m  n matrix, where m is the samples and n is the compounds in the essential oil.
2: The cumulated data corresponded to the samples collected in Bregbo and consisted of 82 individuals (82 samples) and 84 variables (84 identified compounds).
3: Among the 84 compounds in the table of data, only those containing less than 40 zero values and having a percentage of the total quantity  0.02 were selected for the PCA.
4: The PCA and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) were performed by R 3.6.0 software.
