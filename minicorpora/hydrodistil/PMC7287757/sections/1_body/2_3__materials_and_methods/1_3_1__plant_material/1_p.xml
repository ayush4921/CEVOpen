 <italic>L. camara</italic> leaves (L), flowers (Fl), fruits (Fr), and stems (S) were collected over the two one-year periods (June 2015–June 2017) in Bregbo (5°18′23.1″N 3°49′49.6″W), 9 kilometers from Bingerville, South of Côte d’Ivoire. For harvesting, a complete experimental plan in a randomized complete block was designed in order to avoid interindividual variability. Each sample was randomly collected from 20 different plants inside the collection parcel, and plants were not collected twice during the experiment to avoid injury effects. After harvesting, the plant material was authenticated at the Centre National de Floristique (CNF), Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire (Voucher specimen N° UCJ017433).
