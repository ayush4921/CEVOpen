<p>Investigations of the insecticidal activity of the 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> essential oils against 
 <italic>S. granarius</italic> were carried out by direct contact application [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-25-02400" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Talisma UL (Cypermetrine Biosix SA, Belgium) was used as positive control. Different concentrations, from 6 to 42 µL/mL, of essential oil and Talisma were prepared in acetone. Five-hundred microliter aliquots of the essential oil solutions were applied in a tube containing 20 g of wheat grains. After evaporation of the solvent for 20 min, 12 unsexed adults were placed into the tubes and kept at 28 ± 2 °C and 70 ± 5% relative humidity for 24 h. The control received 500 µL of acetone and was treated under the same conditions. Each essential oil and Talisma solution and the control were made in six replicates. After 24 hours, the number of dead weevils was counted and the weevil’s mortality was calculated according to the following equation [
 <xref rid="B81-molecules-25-02400" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. 
 <disp-formula>Weevil mortality (%) = (Number of dead weevils/Total number of weevils) × 100</disp-formula>
