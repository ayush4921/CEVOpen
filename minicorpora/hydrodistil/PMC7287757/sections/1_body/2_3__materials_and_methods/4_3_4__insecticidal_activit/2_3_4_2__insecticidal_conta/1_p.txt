0: Investigations of the insecticidal activity of the  L. camara essential oils against  S. granarius were carried out by direct contact application [ 27].
1: Talisma UL (Cypermetrine Biosix SA, Belgium) was used as positive control.
2: Different concentrations, from 6 to 42 L/mL, of essential oil and Talisma were prepared in acetone.
3: Five-hundred microliter aliquots of the essential oil solutions were applied in a tube containing 20 g of wheat grains.
4: After evaporation of the solvent for 20 min, 12 unsexed adults were placed into the tubes and kept at 28  2 C and 70  5% relative humidity for 24 h. The control received 500 L of acetone and was treated under the same conditions.
5: Each essential oil and Talisma solution and the control were made in six replicates.
6: After 24 hours, the number of dead weevils was counted and the weevils mortality was calculated according to the following equation [ 81].
7: Weevil mortality (%) = (Number of dead weevils/Total number of weevils)  100
