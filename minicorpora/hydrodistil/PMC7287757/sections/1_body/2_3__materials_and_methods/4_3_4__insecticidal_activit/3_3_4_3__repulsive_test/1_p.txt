0: The repulsive effect of  L. camara essential oils against  S. granarius adults was studied according to McDonald et al.
1: (1970) [ 52].
2: A filter paper disc (8 cm diameter) was cut into two parts.
3: One part was impregnated with the essential oil solution (100 L) (6 to 42 L/mL) and the other part with acetone (100 L).
4: After evaporation, the impregnated paper filter was fixed with adhesive tape and placed in a petri dish.
5: Ten adults of  S. granarius were released into the petri dish, covered and kept at 30  1 C and 70  5% relative humidity.
6: The number of insects present in each part of the filter paper was determined 2 h after exposure.
7: This test was used for each concentration, and the whole treatment was completed in triplicates.
8: The repellent percentage (Pr) was calculated as follows [ 81].
9: Pr = ((Nc  Nt)/(Nc + Nt))  100
