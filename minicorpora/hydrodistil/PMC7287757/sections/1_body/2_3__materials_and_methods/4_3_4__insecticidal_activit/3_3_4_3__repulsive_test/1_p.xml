<p>The repulsive effect of 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> essential oils against 
 <italic>S. granarius</italic> adults was studied according to McDonald et al. (1970) [
 <xref rid="B52-molecules-25-02400" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. A filter paper disc (8 cm diameter) was cut into two parts. One part was impregnated with the essential oil solution (100 µL) (6 to 42 µL/mL) and the other part with acetone (100 µL). After evaporation, the impregnated paper filter was fixed with adhesive tape and placed in a petri dish. Ten adults of 
 <italic>S. granarius</italic> were released into the petri dish, covered and kept at 30 ± 1 °C and 70 ± 5% relative humidity. The number of insects present in each part of the filter paper was determined 2 h after exposure. This test was used for each concentration, and the whole treatment was completed in triplicates. The repellent percentage (Pr) was calculated as follows [

 <disp-formula>Pr = ((Nc − Nt)/(Nc + Nt)) × 100</disp-formula>
