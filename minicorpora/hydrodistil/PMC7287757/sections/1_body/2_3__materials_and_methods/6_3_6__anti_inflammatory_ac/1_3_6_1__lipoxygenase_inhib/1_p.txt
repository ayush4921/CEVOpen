0: Lipoxygenase (EC 1.13.11.12) (LOX) from  Glycine max was determined in vitro by the spectrophotometric method described by Tanoh et al.
1: (2019) [ 85] with some modifications.
2: A mixture of sodium borate buffer (800 L, 0.2 M, pH 9) and soybean LOX solution (Sigma-Aldrich) (35 L, 1000 U/mL) was incubated with different concentrations of essential oil (100 L) in a 1 mL cell at room temperature for 15 min.
3: After incubation, the linoleic acid substrate (35 L, 250 M) was added to each cell to start the reaction with the formation of hydroperoxides.
4: The absorbance was measured at 234 nm.
5: All tests were performed in triplicate.
6: Quercetin (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a standard inhibitor at the same concentration as the essential oils.
7: Inhibition of LOX was calculated using the following equation [ 86].
8: % Inhibition = (S  E)/S  100
