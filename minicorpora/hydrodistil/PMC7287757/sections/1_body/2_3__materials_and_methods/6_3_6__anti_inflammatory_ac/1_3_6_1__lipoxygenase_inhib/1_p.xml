<p>Lipoxygenase (EC 1.13.11.12) (LOX) from 
 <italic>Glycine max</italic> was determined in vitro by the spectrophotometric method described by Tanoh et al. (2019) [
 <xref rid="B85-molecules-25-02400" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>] with some modifications. A mixture of sodium borate buffer (800 µL, 0.2 M, pH 9) and soybean LOX solution (Sigma-Aldrich) (35 µL, 1000 U/mL) was incubated with different concentrations of essential oil (100 µL) in a 1 mL cell at room temperature for 15 min. After incubation, the linoleic acid substrate (35 µL, 250 µM) was added to each cell to start the reaction with the formation of hydroperoxides. The absorbance was measured at 234 nm. All tests were performed in triplicate. Quercetin (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a standard inhibitor at the same concentration as the essential oils. Inhibition of LOX was calculated using the following equation [
