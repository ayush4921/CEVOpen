0: The bovine serum protein denaturation method assay reported by Smitha et al.
1: (2017) [ 87] was used to determine the in vitro anti-inflammatory activity of each essential oil sample.
2: The methodology was adapted for this study.
3: Initially, the samples of essential oil and the positive control (diclofenac sodium) were dissolved in methanol for the preparation of various concentrations (25, 50, 75, and 100 g/mL).
4: A mixture of 0.5 mL of solution, consisting of 0.45 mL bovine serum albumin (5%  w/ v) and 0.05 mL of essential oil concentration or diclofenac, was incubated at 37 C for 20 min and the temperature was then increased to keep the samples at 57 C for 3 min.
5: After cooling, 2.5 mL of phosphate buffer pH 6.3 was added.
6: Each concentration was analyzed in triplicate.
7: The reading was performed at 255 nm absorbance using a UVVis dual-beam spectrophotometer (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA).
8: The percentage of inhibition was calculated by the following formula [ 68],  % Inhibition = [(Abs C  Abs T)/Abs C]  100 where Abs C is the absorbance of the reactional media without inhibitor or essential oils and Abs T is the absorbance of the test sample.
