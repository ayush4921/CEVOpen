<p>The bovine serum protein denaturation method assay reported by Smitha et al. (2017) [
 <xref rid="B87-molecules-25-02400" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] was used to determine the in vitro anti-inflammatory activity of each essential oil sample. The methodology was adapted for this study. Initially, the samples of essential oil and the positive control (diclofenac sodium) were dissolved in methanol for the preparation of various concentrations (25, 50, 75, and 100 μg/mL). A mixture of 0.5 mL of solution, consisting of 0.45 mL bovine serum albumin (5%

After cooling, 2.5 mL of phosphate buffer pH 6.3 was added. Each concentration was analyzed in triplicate. The reading was performed at 255 nm absorbance using a UV–Vis dual-beam spectrophotometer (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). The percentage of inhibition was calculated by the following formula [

 <disp-formula>% Inhibition = [(Abs C − Abs T)/Abs C] × 100</disp-formula> where Abs C is the absorbance of the reactional media without inhibitor or essential oils and Abs T is the absorbance of the test sample.
