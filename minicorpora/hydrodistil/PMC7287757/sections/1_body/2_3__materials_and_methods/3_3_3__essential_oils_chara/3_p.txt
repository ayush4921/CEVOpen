0: For the NMR analysis, compounds were identified in the complex essential oil mixtures by comparison of NMR signals, chemical shifts and peak intensities with spectral data of reference compounds, compiled in a laboratory-built library using homemade software, as previously described [ 79, 80].
1: In the investigated samples, the individual components were identified by NMR at proportions as low as 0.30.4%.
