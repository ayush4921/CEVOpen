<p>GC-FID analyses were carried out using a Clarus 500 Perkin Elmer (Perkin Elmer, Courtaboeuf, France) system equipped with a FID detector and two fused-silica capillary columns (50 m × 0.22 mm, film thickness 0.25 µm), BP-1 (polydimethylsiloxane), and BP-20 (polyethylene glycol). The oven temperature was programmed from 60 °C to 220 °C with an increase of 2 °C/min and then held isothermally at 220 °C for 20 min; injector temperature: 250 °C; detector temperature: 250 °C; carrier gas: helium (0.8 mL/min); split: 1/60. The relative proportions of the essential oil constituents were expressed as a percentage obtained by peak area normalization, without using correction factors. Retention index (RI) was determined by comparison with retention times of a series of n-alkanes with linear interpolation (Target Compounds software from Perkin Elmer). For GC-MS analysis, samples were analyzed with a Clarus SQ8S Perkin Elmer TurboMass detector (quadrupole), directly coupled to a Clarus 580 Perkin-Elmer Autosystem XL, equipped with a Rtx-1 (polydimethylsiloxane) fused-silica capillary column (60 m 9 0.22 mm i.d., film thickness 0.25 µm). The oven temperature was programmed to rise from 60 °C to 230 °C at 2 °C/min and then held isothermally at 230 °C for 45 min; injector temperature: 250 °C; ion-source temperature: 150 °C; carrier gas: helium (1 mL/min); split ratio: 1:80; injection volume: 0.2 mL; ionization energy: 70 eV. The electron ionization mass spectra were acquired over the mass range 35 to 350 Da.</p>
