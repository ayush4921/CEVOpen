 <italic>L. camara</italic> is a plant widely used in traditional medicine for the treatment of numerous afflictions. In a previous study, we already characterized a new chemotype for Ivorian 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> essential oils, with high thymol contents, in comparison with essential oils obtained from 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> growing in other countries. In this study, we aimed to better investigate molecular variations during the plant life cycle by studying the impact of the phenological variability on essential oil compositions over a two-year period. Statistical analysis highlighted a high chemical variability between essential oils hydrodistillated from different plant organs, but also within the same organ over the collection period, showing the effect of seasonal variability on essential oil compositions. More specifically, it was demonstrated that some compounds, such as thymol, were present in higher proportions during the flowering and fruiting months. However, despite this variability, Ivorian essential oil compositions were still different to those obtained in other countries, showing the presence of one chemotype with significant phenological variations during the plant life cycle. The high thymol proportion was correlated with a better insecticidal activity against 
 <italic>S. granarius</italic>. Additionally, results showed that essential oils produced here have high antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, which confirms the use of this plant for efficient medical care in traditional medicine. However, large differences in biological activity were shown for essential oils hydrodistillated from different organs and for essential oils from the same organ but not the same collection month. It is well known that choosing the right chemotype and organ is crucial to use essential oils. However, our study demonstrates that the phenological stage also influences essential oil compositions. It is thus primordial to collect plants at the proper moment, correlating with peaks in active molecules, for efficient use of essential oils in traditional medicine or as an insecticide.
