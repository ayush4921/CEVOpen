<p>In a previous paper, we highlighted that essential oils produced from Ivorian 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> constitute a new chemotype with high thymol contents, in comparison with essential oils hydrodistillated from 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> growing in other countries [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-25-02400" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, although 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> essential oils are widely used in traditional medicine, there is no data available on the impact of the variability due to phenological stage on essential oil compositions. As differences in essential oil compositions will impact their biological activities, and thus their efficiency in the treatment of target diseases, the aim of the present work was to rigorously study the variability in essential oil compositions within different 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> organs, and to examine the effects of seasonal variations on essential oil compositions and their biological activities. Those were investigated monthly over a two-year period with 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> growing at the same localization.
