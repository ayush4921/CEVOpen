 <italic>Lantana camara</italic> Lin (
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>camara</italic>, Verbenaceae) is an invasive weed present in many countries [

 <xref rid="B2-molecules-25-02400" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-25-02400" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This thorny shrub grows from 2 to 5 m high; its ripe fruits are blackish and its flowers are found in a variety of colors, with its flowering and fruiting seasons occurring almost year-round [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-25-02400" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> is commonly used as an ornamental plant [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-25-02400" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-25-02400" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], but also in traditional medicine in many countries [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-25-02400" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Indeed, its leaves are used in infusions or decoctions to treat sores, measles, intestinal worms, fever [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-25-02400" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], ulcer, malaria, and rheumatism [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-25-02400" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-25-02400" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The powdered root is used for stomach ache [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-25-02400" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], while lotion made from the roots is used in the treatment of toothache and ulcers [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-25-02400" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Whole plant infusions are also used to treat bronchitis [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-25-02400" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Different solvent extracts produced from 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> have already been studied, showing the occurrence of flavonoids, triterpenes, and glycosides [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-25-02400" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These extracts and compounds were described as having interesting antioxidant, anti-inflammatory [

 <xref rid="B20-molecules-25-02400" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Some studies have also focused on 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> essential oils, showing the high diversity in essential oil compositions depending on plant growth area. The major compounds reported were sesquiterpenes, such as (
 <italic>E</italic>)-β-caryophyllene, α-humulene, davanone, and germacrene D [

 <xref rid="B23-molecules-25-02400" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Some monoterpenes were also found in high proportions, such as thymol, sabinene, and limonene [
