<p>Unlike the leaves and flowers, there is less scientific data on the composition of essential oils obtained from 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> fruits and stems. The composition of fruit essential oils seems to vary a lot as palmitic acid was the major constituent in south China (22.5%) [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-25-02400" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and Northern India (22.8%) [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-25-02400" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], while that compound was absent from Ivorian samples from Adzope and Toumodi, which contained high proportions of (
 <italic>E</italic>)-β-caryophyllene and α-humulene [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-25-02400" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Stem essential oils were dominated by germacrene D (31%) in south China [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-25-02400" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and by palmitic acid (32.7%) in Northern India [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-25-02400" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Moreover, one fruit sample (August, second period) showed a different profile due to the high quantity of neral and geranial, which were not present in the fruit essential oils of Northern India.
