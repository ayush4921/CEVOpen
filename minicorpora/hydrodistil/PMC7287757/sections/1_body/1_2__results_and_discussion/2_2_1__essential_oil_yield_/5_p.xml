 <italic>L. camara</italic> stem essential oils also contained high proportions of oxygenated monoterpenes during several months: up to 41.1% of thymol and 9.2% linalool in August corresponding to the first harvesting period. In the same period, p-cymene reached 5.9% and γ-terpinene 6.2%. Palmitic acid was also present at 11.6% and 10.8% in September and October, respectively, in the second period (
