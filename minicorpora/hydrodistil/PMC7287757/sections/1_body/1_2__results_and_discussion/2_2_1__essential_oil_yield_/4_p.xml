<p>Flower (Fl) essential oils: Most essential oils isolated from 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> flowers were dominated by (
 <italic>E</italic>)-β-caryophyllene (19.2–36.6%) and α-humulene (8.5–19.9%). However, the thymol proportion reached 34.3%, 26.3%, and 21.6% in July, August, and November 2015, respectively (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-02400-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), but was under 1% during other periods of the year. Sabinene and linalool (monoterpenes) were found in appreciable proportions (up to ~6%) in more than one month. Previous studies revealed the predominance of sesquiterpenes [
