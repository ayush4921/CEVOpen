<p>Leaf (L) essential oils: Up to 99.1% of the total components were identified in the leaf essential oils. In all samples, (
 <italic>E)-</italic>β-caryophyllene (24.4–39.9%) and α-humulene (10.1–20.5%) were the two major molecules. Monoterpenes, such as α-pinene and sabinene, were present in lower proportions, but still reached 6.5% and 10.9%, respectively, in June 2016. Furthermore, the thymol proportion fluctuated greatly as it dominated in July (16.5%) and August (18.4%) 2015, but was lower than 2.3% for the other months (

 <italic>L. camara</italic> essential oil composition. Furthermore, it has been observed that the chemical composition of leaf essential oils shows high variations from one country to another and sometimes even within different regions (
