<p>The hydrodistillation of 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> organs produced pale yellow essential oils, whose yields fluctuated during harvest periods, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02400-f001">Figure 1</xref>a. This high variability might arise from climatic and seasonal parameters. It should be noted that, at a given season, 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> harvesting led to very low quantities of plant materials, which did not allow an accurate quantification of the essential oil yields (e.g., flowers in January of the first harvest period). Leaf essential oil yields obtained in this study (0.04â€“0.12%, 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic>) were lower than those of 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> leaves from Egypt (0.36% 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-25-02400" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] but were close to the yield of 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> fresh leaves from Brazil (0.1% 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-25-02400" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Differences can result from the hydrodistillation and plant storage conditions as well as from environmental and edaphic constraints and from genetic differences between the different populations.
