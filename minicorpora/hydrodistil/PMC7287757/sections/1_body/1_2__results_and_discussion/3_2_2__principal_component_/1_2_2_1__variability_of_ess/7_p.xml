<p>It was noted that 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> essential oil chemical compositions varied quantitatively and qualitatively from one organ to another during the plant’s life cycle. Those variations may be related to some ecological factors such as the plant’s age, the plant life cycle stage, the harvesting time, or even interindividual genetic differences between plants growing at the same location [

 <xref rid="B44-molecules-25-02400" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. When an essential oil is produced for certain properties, a constant chemical composition is needed. The knowledge of the chemical variations during the plant’s life cycle is then crucial to select the adequate harvesting moment. This was previously reported with thymol in thyme essential oil (
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> L. ct thymol), as high compound variations were highlighted throughout the seasons, with maximal thymol yield during the flowering period [

 <italic>L. camara</italic> happened in July and August. It is highly possible that 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> produces more thymol during the flowering and fruiting periods to protect against insect pests. Indeed, aromatic plants are molecular sources of insecticidal or insect-repelling substances capable of inducing plant protection. Some insects are particularly sensitive to the activity of oxygenated terpenes, especially phenolic ones such as carvacrol, thymol, terpineol, or linalool [
