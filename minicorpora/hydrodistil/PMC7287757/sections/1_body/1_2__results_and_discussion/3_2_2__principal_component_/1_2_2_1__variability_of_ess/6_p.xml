<p>These four clusters were easily identified on the first principal plane of the PCA. Joint analysis of

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02400-f003">Figure 3</xref>a showed that the leaf essential oil generally had a high portion of sabinene and low portion of thymol and linalool. For stem, flower, and fruit essential oils, it was the opposite, with a higher proportion of thymol and linalool and a lower presence of sabinene. The proportion and standard deviation of the principal compound of each cluster can be found in

The compositions of the stems, flowers, and leaves differ quite clearly from each other, whereas the composition of the fruits is more variable and intermediate between that of the stems and flowers. Indeed, cluster I, which essentially consisted of leaf essential oils, could mark the stage of formation of flower buds during the vegetative cycle of the plant. Cluster II announces the formation of fruits by the abundance of flowers. Cluster III, which formed a mixture of fruit, stem, and flower samples, presented the lowest (
 <italic>E)-</italic>β-caryophyllene (17.61 ± 5.061%) and α-humulene (8.423 ± 0.948%) proportion (
