<p>A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was conducted to identify possible variations in the chemical composition of 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> essential oils according to the monthâ€™s harvesting period. It revealed that the first and second principal components accounted for 74.26% of the total variance of the chemical composition. The first principal component (Dim1, 53.12%) was essentially composed of three opposing monoterpenes: sabinene (with positive contribution) and linalool and thymol (with negative contributions). In addition, it was noted that the second principal component (Dim2, 21.14%) was essentially built from the positive contributions of sesquiterpenes (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02400-f002">Figure 2</xref>b shows the samples map on the first principal plane which indicates that, in general, the chemical composition of essential oils from 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> organs harvested at the same site is quite variable. This variability was high within the different organs, but was also present between harvesting periods and months. Indeed, for the same organ, some samples displayed very different chemical compositions. It induced, for example, the presence of essential oil samples of the same organ in different clusters that were formed by hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA). Four principal clusters can be reported (
