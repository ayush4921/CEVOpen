<p>Four clusters were found for the flower essential oils. The individual factor map of the PCA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02400-f004">Figure 4</xref>b) shows that the chemical composition of the July, August, and November samples of the first harvest period were similar and create cluster 2 (G2). The flower essential oil sample in April of the first harvest was far away from all samples, and this sample alone constitutes the third cluster (G3). Some samples in cluster 1 (G1) and cluster 4 (G4) had chemical compositions which were not significantly different; therefore, the separation of these two groups was not clear-cut.
