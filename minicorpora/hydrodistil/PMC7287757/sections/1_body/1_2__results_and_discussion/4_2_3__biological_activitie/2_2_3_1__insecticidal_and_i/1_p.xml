<p>Contact insecticidal activity and insect repellent activities of the three essential oils isolated from 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> were evaluated against adults of 
 <italic>Sitophilus granarius</italic> (
 <italic>S. granarius</italic>). This insect is a major pest that causes dramatic grain losses during storage in silos all over the world [

 <xref rid="B51-molecules-25-02400" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Essential oils and the reference insecticide Talisma were diluted in acetone at different concentrations (6 to 42 µL/mL). Insect mortality curves were determined and LD
 <sub>50</sub> values (Lethal Dose causing 50% of mortality after 24 h) were calculated. The LD
 <sub>50</sub> value of the flower essential oil was 13.67 µL/mL and the other essential oils were 25.49 µL/mL and 27.38 µl/mL, respectively. The LD
 <sub>50</sub> of Talisma was 9.87 µL/mL.
