<p>For the repellent activity evaluation, six replicates were carried out, bringing 10 adult insects into contact with two half filter paper discs, one impregnated with acetone and the other one with an essential oil solution, for each experiment. According to the classification of McDonald et al. (1970) [
 <xref rid="B52-molecules-25-02400" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], it can be said that the repellent effect of 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> essential oils increases with concentration. At the concentration of 6 µL/mL, LC (L) Jl was weakly repellent (26.66 ± 0.57%), whereas LC (Fl) Jl was moderately active (60 ± 1%). However, at the maximal concentration used in the test (42 µL/mL), these two essential oil samples were more active with a repellency rate of 86.66 ± 0.57% and 93.33 ± 0.57%, respectively. In comparison, at this concentration, LC (L) Jl2 had a repellency rate of 73.33 ± 0.57% (
