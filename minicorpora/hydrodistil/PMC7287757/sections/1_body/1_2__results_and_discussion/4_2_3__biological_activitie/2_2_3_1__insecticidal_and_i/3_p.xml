<p>The contact toxicity test highlighted the high insecticidal potential of the flower essential oil as its LD
 <sub>50</sub> value was close to the Talisma reference. This high insecticidal activity can be attributed to its thymol percentage (34.5%), which was lower in leaf essential oils (LC (L) Jl: 16.5%; LC (L) Jl2: 0.4%), as many studies have already showed the insecticidal power of this molecule [

Moreover, the oxygenated monoterpenes proportion in the flower essential oil (40.4%) was higher than in the leaf essential oils (19.5% and 2.9%). As monoterpenes, and especially oxygenated monoterpenes, are frequently described as insecticidal molecules [

 <xref rid="B57-molecules-25-02400" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], the highlighted activity may also be due to those molecules. Indeed, compounds such as carvacrol, linalool, eugenol, and terpineol are more toxic than camphor and Î±-pinene [

Furthermore, essential oils are mixtures of chemical compounds of different natures and functions. Consequently, the combined action of several compounds causes a phenomena of synergy or antagonism which would be at the origin of the effectiveness of the essential oil [
