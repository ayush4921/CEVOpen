<p>In the literature, the antioxidant activities of

 <xref rid="B66-molecules-25-02400" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. However, we showed here that the composition of 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> essential oils from different plant organs, and from plants growing at different places, varies widely. The results found in this study are due to thymol, whose antioxidant properties have already been demonstrated [

 <xref rid="B68-molecules-25-02400" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Moreover, the occurrence of p-cymene, borneol, β-myrcene, camphene, verbenone, 1,8-cineole, α-pinene, α-terpinene, and γ-terpinene, even in small proportions, may also contribute to the antioxidant activity [

 <xref rid="B71-molecules-25-02400" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. This explains the lower antioxidant activity of LC (L) Jl2 essential oil, in comparison with LC (L) Jl essential oil in which 16.5% of thymol was found, but other constituents may contribute to its antioxidant activity with a probable synergistic effect.
