<p>For the DPPH radical scavenging assay, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> was determined for each essential oil using Graph Pad Prism 8.2.1 software. This factor represents the essential oil concentration which decreased the DPPH concentration by 50%. The flower essential oil showed a greater radical scavenging activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 15.53 ± 0.14 µg/mL) than those from the leaves harvested in July of the first (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 21.96 ± 0.25 µg/mL) and second (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 71.19 ± 1.33 µg/mL) periods. Trolox and ascorbic acid showed IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 12.36 ± 0.02 and 11.80 ± 0.01 µg/mL, respectively (
