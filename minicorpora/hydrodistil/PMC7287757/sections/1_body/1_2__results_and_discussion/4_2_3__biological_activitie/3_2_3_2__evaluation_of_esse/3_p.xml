<p>For the FRAP method, results recorded in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02400-f006">Figure 6</xref>a showed that, among the essential oil samples, the higher absorbance was observed with the flower essential oil. As higher absorbance measurements indicated a greater reducing power, this essential oil showed a high reducing power. The essential oil of the LC (L) Jl2 showed a low activity.
