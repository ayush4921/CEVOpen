<p>Results showed that all essential oils had interesting anti-inflammatory activities, the leaf samples displaying higher anti-inflammatory activities than the flower essential oil. The high anti-inflammatory activity of the LC (L) Jl2 sample is probably due to the high proportions of 
 <italic>(E)-</italic>β-caryophyllene and α-humulene, which are particularly effective [

 <italic>L. camara</italic> extracts has previously been demonstrated in several studies [

 <italic>L. camara</italic> is a plant with anti-inflammatory properties in various forms, supporting the wide use of this plant in traditional medicine for its anti-rheumatism properties [
