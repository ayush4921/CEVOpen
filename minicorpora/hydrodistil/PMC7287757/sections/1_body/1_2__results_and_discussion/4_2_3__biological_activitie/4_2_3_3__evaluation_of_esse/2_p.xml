<p>In the first method, the ability of essential oils to inhibit LOX, an enzyme involved in the inflammation process, was evaluated in vitro. LOX inhibitory activity results (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) (

 <sub>50</sub> value of 17.23 ± 0.10 µg/mL. Quercetin was used as a reference (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 13.54 ± 0.01 µg/mL). In the second method, the in vitro anti-inflammatory effect of

 <sub>50</sub> value was 15.31 ± 0.17 µg/mL. Additionally, the Tukey’s test showed that the difference between diclofenac and LC (L) Jl2 was not significant.
