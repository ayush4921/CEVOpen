<p>Cytotoxicity on non-malignant cells was also studied using three models: (i) MCF-10A (ATCC
 <sup>®</sup> CRL-10317) normal breast cells cultured in DMEM/F12 (Gibco) supplemented with 5% donor horse serum (BioSera), 20 ng/mL EGF (PanEco), 0.5 µg/mL hydrocortisone (ChemCruz), and 10 µg/mL insulin (PanEco) at 37 °C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> and 80–85% humidity), (ii) J774A.1 (murine macrophage cell line, ATCC
 <sup>®</sup>, TIB-67™) cultivated in Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (DMEM; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) supplemented at 10% of HFBS, antibiotics and maintained on a roller culture apparatus at 5 rpm and (iii) PMM isolated with RPMI and antibiotics at the moment of use. Briefly, 50 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> MCF-10A cells were seeded into 24-well plates in 900 μL of the medium, and then, the activity of EO-ML was tested as described above for the case of MCF-7 breast cancer cells. In the case of J774A.1 cells, 200 µL with 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/mL were distributed in the wells of the 96-well microplates, incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 24 h to allow attachment, and non-adherent cells were eliminated after washing. Then, fresh medium and different concentrations of EO were added, and the plate was incubated for an additional 24 h at the same condition. Finally, cellular viability was determined fluorometrically by the resazurin method, as previously described [
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-25-05514" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In the case of PMM, macrophages were obtained by peritoneal washing in RPMI medium and antibiotics as mentioned and seeded at 3 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/mL. The plate was incubated at 37 °C, and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 2 h, and non-attached cells were removed. Then, fresh medium with HFBS and EO at different concentrations were added to additional incubation for 48 h under the same conditions. Cellular viability was then measured by the MTT method as described above.
