0: Cytotoxicity on non-malignant cells was also studied using three models: (i) MCF-10A (ATCC  CRL-10317) normal breast cells cultured in DMEM/F12 (Gibco) supplemented with 5% donor horse serum (BioSera), 20 ng/mL EGF (PanEco), 0.5 g/mL hydrocortisone (ChemCruz), and 10 g/mL insulin (PanEco) at 37 C, 5% CO 2 and 8085% humidity), (ii) J774A.1 (murine macrophage cell line, ATCC , TIB-67TM) cultivated in Dulbeccos modified eagle medium (DMEM; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) supplemented at 10% of HFBS, antibiotics and maintained on a roller culture apparatus at 5 rpm and (iii) PMM isolated with RPMI and antibiotics at the moment of use.
1: Briefly, 50  10 3 MCF-10A cells were seeded into 24-well plates in 900 L of the medium, and then, the activity of EO-ML was tested as described above for the case of MCF-7 breast cancer cells.
2: In the case of J774A.1 cells, 200 L with 10 5 cells/mL were distributed in the wells of the 96-well microplates, incubated at 37 C, 5% CO 2 for 24 h to allow attachment, and non-adherent cells were eliminated after washing.
3: Then, fresh medium and different concentrations of EO were added, and the plate was incubated for an additional 24 h at the same condition.
4: Finally, cellular viability was determined fluorometrically by the resazurin method, as previously described [ 50].
5: In the case of PMM, macrophages were obtained by peritoneal washing in RPMI medium and antibiotics as mentioned and seeded at 3  10 5 cells/mL.
6: The plate was incubated at 37 C, and 5% CO 2 for 2 h, and non-attached cells were removed.
7: Then, fresh medium with HFBS and EO at different concentrations were added to additional incubation for 48 h under the same conditions.
8: Cellular viability was then measured by the MTT method as described above.
