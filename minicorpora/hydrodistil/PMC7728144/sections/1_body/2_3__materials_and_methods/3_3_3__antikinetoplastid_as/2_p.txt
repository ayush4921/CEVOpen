0: For antileishmanial activity, the intracellular amastigote model of  L. amazonensis (MHOM/77BR/LTB0016) was used.
1: PMM were obtained by peritoneal washing with RPMI medium (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) supplemented with antibiotics from healthy BALB/c mice and plated at 10 6/mL in a 24-well plate.
2: After incubation at 37 C and 5% CO 2 for 2 h, non-adherent cells were removed, and stationary-phase promastigotes were added at a 4:1 parasite/macrophage ratio in the medium supplemented with heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HFBS; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA).
3: The plate was incubated at the same condition for 4 h, and free parasites were also removed.
4: Subsequently, products were added, and four serial dilutions were carried out.
5: The plate was incubated at the same conditions for 48 h as described above [ 47].
6: After that, the supernatant was discarded, cells were fixed with methanol, stained with 10% Giemsa and microscopically examined (Motic, Japan) under immersion oil at 1000.
7: The total parasite burden was determined according to the number of infected macrophages and the number of amastigotes inside the macrophages after counting of 100 macrophages.
