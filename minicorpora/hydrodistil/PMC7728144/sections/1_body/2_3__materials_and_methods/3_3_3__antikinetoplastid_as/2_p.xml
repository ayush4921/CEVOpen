<p>For antileishmanial activity, the intracellular amastigote model of 
 <italic>L. amazonensis</italic> (MHOM/77BR/LTB0016) was used. PMM were obtained by peritoneal washing with RPMI medium (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) supplemented with antibiotics from healthy BALB/c mice and plated at 10
 <sup>6</sup>/mL in a 24-well plate. After incubation at 37 °C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 2 h, non-adherent cells were removed, and stationary-phase promastigotes were added at a 4:1 parasite/macrophage ratio in the medium supplemented with heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HFBS; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). The plate was incubated at the same condition for 4 h, and free parasites were also removed. Subsequently, products were added, and four serial dilutions were carried out. The plate was incubated at the same conditions for 48 h as described above [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-25-05514" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. After that, the supernatant was discarded, cells were fixed with methanol, stained with 10% Giemsa and microscopically examined (Motic, Japan) under immersion oil at 1000×. The total parasite burden was determined according to the number of infected macrophages and the number of amastigotes inside the macrophages after counting of 100 macrophages.
