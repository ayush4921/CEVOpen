0: For antitrypanosomal activity, two species were included:  T. brucei (Squib-427) and  T. cruzi (Tulahuen CL2).
1: For  T. brucei, 1.5  10 4 trypomastigotes cultured in Hirumi-9 medium supplemented with 10% inactivated fetal calf serum (FCSi; Invitrogen, Belgium) and tested products were added in a 96-well plate and incubated at 37 C and 5% CO 2 for 72 h [ 45].
2: Then, parasite growth was assessed fluorimetrically using 20 L of resazurin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) at 50 g/mL.
3: The plate was incubated for an additional 24 h under the same conditions and read at 530 nm excitation and 590 nm emission in a Tecan GENios Multifunction Fluorimeter (Tecan Group, Maennedorf, Switzerland).
4: On the other hand, EO at different concentrations was added to 4  10 4 amastigotes in 4  10 3 MRC-5 cells using minimal essential medium (MEM; Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 20 mM  l-glutamine, 16.5 mM sodium bicarbonate, and 5% of FCSi in a plate of 96-wells and incubated for seven days at 37 C and 5% CO 2.
5: In this case, parasite viability was determined colorimetrically by adding the -galactosidase substrate chlorophenol red - d-galactopyranoside (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA).
6: Finally, the absorbance was read at 540 nm after 4 h of incubation at 37 C [ 46].
