0: Based on previous information, this work presents the studies of EO-ML growing in Cuba: (i) analysis of the chemical composition by gas-chromatography coupled with a mass spectrometric detector (GC-MS); (ii) a general antiproliferative in vitro assessment against kinetoplastid parasites ( L. amazonensis,  T. cruzi, and  T. brucei), malignant cell lines: Human prostate carcinoma cell line (22Rv1) and human breast cancer (MCF-7), and non-malignant murine macrophages: Continuous culture using the cell line J774A.1 and primary non-growing macrophage from the peritoneum of BALB/c mice (PMM); (iii) in vitro evaluation of the main compound of EO-ML on more susceptible cultures; and (iv) effects of EO-ML on experimental cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in BALB/c mice caused by  L. amazonensis.
