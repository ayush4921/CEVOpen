<p>In addition, our results open new perspectives to further investigations to clarify: (i) Therapeutic value of EO-ML for African trypanosomiasis on relevant 
 <italic>T. brucei rhodesiense</italic> and 
 <italic>T. brucei gambiense</italic> infectious agents through in vitro and in vivo models, (ii) the possibility of the application of this oil as alternative to traditional treatment in cancer-resistant cells, (iii) potentialities of a combination of oil constituents, and (iv) mechanism of action of EO-ML, as well as the pure compounds. In conclusion, the results reported here represent an advancement in studies on EOs as drug candidates and might promote preclinical investigations on oil standardization.
