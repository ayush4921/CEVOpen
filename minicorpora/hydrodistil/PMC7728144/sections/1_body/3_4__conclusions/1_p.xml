<p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on antiproliferative potentialities of EO-ML growing in Cuba, confirming the medical value of the plant. However, the inability of 1,8-cineole to demonstrate a strong antikinetoplastid activity reveals that other ingredients or a possible synergism are involved in the activity of the EO. In particular, the leishmanicidal effect of EO-ML was confirmed in vivo using a murine model of CL, which the tested product was able to significantly reduce the lesion size and parasite burden in infected tissues similar to the reference drug.</p>
