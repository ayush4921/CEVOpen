<p>A review of the literature revealed variation in qualitative and quantitative chemical compositions of EO-ML from plants collected in Cuba, depending on their location. In this sense, Pino et al. reported that the analysis of the aerial parts from 
 <italic>M. leucadendra</italic> collected in Matanzas Province showed also 1,8-cineole (43.0%) as the main compound [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-25-05514" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]; while the major component was viridiflorol (28.2%) in samples from Pinar del Rio Province [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-25-05514" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In parallel, other reports showed the 1,8-cineole chemotype from plants growing in Brazil [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-25-05514" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and Egypt [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-25-05514" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] with 48.7% and 64.3% 1,8-cineole, respectively. Nevertheless, other chemotypes have also been documented based on phenylpropanoids (namely eugenol methyl ether and (
 <italic>E</italic>)-
 <italic>iso</italic>-eugenol methyl ether) or nerolidol chemotypes [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-25-05514" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-25-05514" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].
