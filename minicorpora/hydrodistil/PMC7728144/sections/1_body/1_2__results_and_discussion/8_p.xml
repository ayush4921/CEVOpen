<p>It is concluded, therefore, that the oil exhibited comparable susceptibilities against both 
 <italic>L. amazonensis</italic> and 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic>, and presented higher in-vitro activity and selectivity than the pure main component. However, Caridha et al. [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-25-05514" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] highlighted the need for new treatments for CL, due to current treatments showing poor justification through clinical trials and sub-optimal effectiveness [

 <xref rid="B36-molecules-25-05514" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In particular, against 
 <italic>L. amazonensis</italic>, the EO-ML displayed an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 8 μg/mL and a selectivity index = 18 (with respect to J774) and 13 (with respect to PMM), which are in concordance with international criteria related to the development of natural products for cutaneous species, i.e., (i) classification as highly active with IC
 <sub>50</sub> &lt; 10 μg/mL [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-25-05514" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and (ii) a selectivity index &gt;5 [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-25-05514" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In the Neotropics, 
 <italic>L. amazonensis</italic> is considered to be one of the most important species that causes cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL). In addition, nearly 1% of all CL cases can develop an anergic diffuse CL infection, which is characterized by massive dermal infiltrates and presents clinical, immunological, parasitological, anatomopathological, and therapeutic responses different from other CL forms. This clinical presentation is chronic with frequent relapses due to non-response to conventional treatment [

 <xref rid="B38-molecules-25-05514" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Thus, the effect of EO-ML was evaluated in the model of experimental CL caused by 
 <italic>L. amazonensis</italic> in BALB/c mice.
