<p>Although the promising biological activities of EO-ML have been known for decades, herein we compared for the first time the activity of the same EO obtained from plants cultivated in Cuba against different prokaryotic (Gram-positive bacteria: 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic>, Gram-negative bacteria: 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, and fungi: 
 <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic>, 
 <italic>Candida parapsilosis</italic>, 
 <italic>Microsporum canis</italic>) and eukaryotic (kinetoplastid parasites: 
 <italic>Trypanosoma</italic> and 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic>, malignant: EFO-21, MCF-7, and 22Rv1, resistant malignant sublines: MCF-7/Rap and MCF-7/4OHTAMO, as well as non-malignant continuous cultures: MCF-10A and J774.A1, and primary macrophages from the peritoneum of BALB/c mice (PMM)). Then, antimicrobial screening of EO-ML shown that this product did not affect bacterial or fungal growth at the maximal tested concentration (500 μg/mL); except against dermatophyte 
 <italic>M. canis</italic> with a bordered activity (MIC 125 μg/mL). However, regarding the parasitic protozoa, EO-ML demonstrated activity against 
 <italic>L. amazonensis</italic> and 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic> with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values &lt;10 μg/mL (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05514-f002">Figure 2</xref>); although no effect was observed against 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic>. In addition, the antiproliferative effect on malignant cells was also appreciated, which were statistically smaller (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) than antiprotozoal activities. Nevertheless, similar IC
 <sub>50</sub> values (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05) against malignant cells and resistant lines were obtained. Finally, the cytotoxicity assay against non-malignant cells revealed IC
 <sub>50</sub> values &gt;94 μg/mL, which generated selectivity indices &gt;11-fold compared with protozoal parasites (
 <italic>L. amazonensis</italic> and 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic>) and approximately 1 or 2-fold with respect to malignant cell lines.
