<p>Although no activity on 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> was observed, a general biological activity against eukaryotic cells was appreciated for EO-ML. In particular, a higher sensitivity of kinetoplastid parasites than mammalian cells was found. Recently, Luna et al. [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-25-05514" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] demonstrated that in the absence of new effective drugs against 
 <italic>Trypanosoma</italic> and 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic>, many studies demanded the use of EOs. In particular, da Silva et al. [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-25-05514" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] reviewed the potential activity of EOs from 35 plant species against 
 <italic>L. amazonensis</italic>, of which 45.7% had an IC
 <sub>50</sub> &lt; 10 Î¼g/mL. Our results, together with reports in the literature, corroborate the antikinetoplastid potential of EOs and could stimulate the development of these natural products as a source of new phytotherapeutics for leishmaniasis and trypanosomiasis treatment.
