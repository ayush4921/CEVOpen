<p>In this study, a high variation in 
 <italic>S. granarius</italic> survival is mediated by the interaction of the lemongrass essential oil, citral, and geranyl acetate with target sites in the nervous system [
 <xref rid="B51-insects-11-00379" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Time periods to induce mortality in 
 <italic>S. granarius</italic> by this essential oil and components were from 24 to 48 h. The low survivorship of this insect seems to be due to the rapid action of lemongrass essential oil, citral, and geranyl acetate, as observed in other coleopteran pests of grains such as 
 <italic>Oryzaephilus surinamensis</italic> Linnaeus (Coleoptera: Silvanidae), 
 <italic>Rhyzopertha dominica</italic> Fabricius (Coleoptera: Bostrichidae), and 
 <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> Herbst (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) after plant terpenoid exposure [

 <xref rid="B61-insects-11-00379" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,
 <xref rid="B62-insects-11-00379" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. In this study, the compared effects of the lemongrass essential oil and its components on 
 <italic>S. granarius</italic> occurred at various time periods. The lower time-mortality of insects exposed to LD
 <sub>50</sub> of lemongrass essential oil in comparison with its compounds citral and geranyl acetate may be due to the lower amount of the components in the essential oil blend, ranging, i.e., citral 18.5% and geranyl acetate 12.5%. The rapid insecticidal activity against 
 <italic>S. granarius</italic> suggests that lemongrass essential oil and its components can be effective against this stored product pest. Thus, they may be a valuable alternative to synthetic chemical insecticides, especially in the management of pest populations that have developed resistance to chemical insecticides.
