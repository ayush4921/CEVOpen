<p>The lemongrass essential oil, geranyl acetate, and citral negatively affect the respiration rate of 
 <italic>S. granarius</italic> up to 3 h after exposure, which indicates the physiological stress caused by the components. The respiration of insects is affected by the energy necessary for their metabolism to produce physiological defense against essential oils [

 <xref rid="B43-insects-11-00379" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Different respiratory responses have been reported for other insects exposed to essential oils and components in

 <italic>T. molitor</italic> [
 <xref rid="B21-insects-11-00379" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Low respiratory rates result in high physical conditioning damage because the energy is reallocated at the expense of physiological processes [

 <italic>S. granarius</italic> exposed to lemongrass essential oil, geranyl acetate, and citral had a decrease in the respiration rates, suggesting a possible fitness cost and energy reallocation.
