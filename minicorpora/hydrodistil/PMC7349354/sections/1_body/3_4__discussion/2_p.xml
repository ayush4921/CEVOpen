<p>Insecticidal and repellent action of lemongrass essential oil and its terpenoids against 
 <italic>S. granarius</italic> were found in bioassays under laboratory conditions. Lemongrass topically applied was toxic against 
 <italic>S. granarius</italic> adults (LD
 <sub>50</sub> = 4.03 µg·insect
 <sup>−1</sup>) and mortality increased in a dose-dependent manner, as also reported in other pests [
 <xref rid="B52-insects-11-00379" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,

 <xref rid="B54-insects-11-00379" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. 
 <italic>Sitophilus granarius</italic> adults exposed to high doses of lemongrass essential oil (LD
 <sub>50</sub> and LD
 <sub>90</sub>) showed muscle contractions and changes in locomotion, and when exposed to LD
 <sub>90</sub>, paralysis without recovery. In this case, symptoms were consistent in 
 <italic>S. granarius</italic>, confirming neurotoxicity. There is a set of results that point to effects on the nervous system of insect pests such as 
 <italic>Bemisia tabaci</italic> (Gennadius) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) [
 <xref rid="B55-insects-11-00379" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], 
 <italic>Callosobruchus maculatus</italic> Fabricius (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) [
 <xref rid="B56-insects-11-00379" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], and 
 <italic>Trichoplusia ni</italic> Hübner (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) [
 <xref rid="B50-insects-11-00379" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] after lemongrass essential oil exposure (by contact or fumigation). These data show that the topical application of different doses of lemongrass essential oil in small volumes is toxic against 
 <italic>S. granarius</italic>.
