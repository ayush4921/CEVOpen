<p>The behavioral response tests show that lemongrass essential oil, geranyl acetate, and citral affect 
 <italic>S. granarius</italic>. Some insect pests alter their locomotion when exposed to lemongrass essential oil and its components and avoided the toxic environments after the detection of the chemical components [

 <xref rid="B42-insects-11-00379" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Plant essential oils have been claimed to disrupt the recognition of the substrate, which impairs the orientation and locomotor activity of insects [

 <xref rid="B64-insects-11-00379" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. According to the results here obtained, the odor of essential oil and its components is repulsive to 
 <italic>S. granarius</italic>. Terpenoids cross the insect body barrier through the spiracles and trachea [

 <italic>S. granarius</italic> adults are repelled by lemongrass essential oil, geranyl acetate, and citral, suggesting that the use of lemongrass essential oil and its components may introduce an innovative approach to control this pest through manipulation of its foraging and avoidance behavior.
