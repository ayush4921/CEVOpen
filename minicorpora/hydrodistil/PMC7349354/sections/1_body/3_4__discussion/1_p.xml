<p>This study investigated the chemical composition of lemongrass essential oil and assessed the insecticidal and repellent activities of the essential oil and its terpenoids citral and geranyl acetate against 
 <italic>S. granarius</italic> under laboratory conditions. The chemical quantitative and qualitative analyses revealed 13 components of lemongrass essential oil. The components present in larger quantities in the lemongrass are neral, citral, geranyl acetate, geranial, limonene, and camphene, which have been reported for this essential oil [

 <italic>S. granaries</italic> with rapid lethality, as reported for other insects [

 <xref rid="B51-insects-11-00379" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Although the mode of action of this essential oil and its components has not been fully elucidated, their toxic effects suggest a viable alternative for the management of stored product pests.
