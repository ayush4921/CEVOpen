<p>The respiration rate of 
 <italic>S. granarius</italic> was influenced by exposure to lemongrass essential oil and its components at LD
 <sub>50</sub> and LD
 <sub>90</sub> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-11-00379-f004">Figure 4</xref>). For LD

 <sub>2</sub> h
 <sup>−1</sup>), citral (1.39 μL of CO

 <sup>−1</sup>), and geranyl acetate (1.32 μL of CO

 <sup>−1</sup>). Similar results were obtained with treatments at LD
 <sub>90</sub>; respiration rates differed after 3 h of exposure (F
 <sub>3,59</sub> = 7.47; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), with mean rates of 1.73 μL CO
 <sub>2</sub> h
 <sup>−1</sup> in the control, 1.46 μL CO
 <sub>2</sub> h
 <sup>−1</sup> in insects exposed to essential oil, 1.16 μL CO
