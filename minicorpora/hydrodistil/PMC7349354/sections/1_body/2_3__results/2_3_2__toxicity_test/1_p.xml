<p>The dose–response model provided a good fit to the data (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05), allowing the determination of toxicological endpoints and confirming the toxicity of lemongrass essential oil and its components to 
 <italic>S. granarius</italic> (
 <xref rid="insects-11-00379-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The LD
 <sub>50</sub> of the essential oil was 4.03 µg·insect
 <sup>−1</sup> (3.29–4.94 µg·insect
 <sup>−1</sup>). The bioassay indicated that geranyl acetate was the most toxic component, with an LD
 <sub>50</sub> of 3.93 µg·insect
 <sup>−1</sup> (3.25–4.77) µg·insect
 <sup>−1</sup>, followed by citral (LD
 <sub>50</sub> = 6.92 µg·insect
 <sup>−1</sup>; range of 5.63–8.58 µg·insect
 <sup>−1</sup>). Both components were used in subsequent tests. Mortality was less than 1% in the control.
