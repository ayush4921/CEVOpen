<p>Quantitative analysis of the lemongrass essential oil was performed in triplicate on a Shimadzu gas chromatograph model GC-17A equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID; Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Kansai, Japan), using chromatographic conditions: a fused silica capillary column (30 m × 0.22 mm) with a DB-5 bound phase (0.25 μm film thickness); column pressure 110 kPa; helium carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.8 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup>; injector temperature 205 °C; detector temperature of 260 °C; column temperature programmed to start at 40 °C (isothermal remaining for 2 min) and increased from 3 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup> to 260 °C (isotherm remaining at 260 °C, for 10 min). A sample of 1 μL (1% 
 <italic>w/v</italic> in dichloromethane) was injected, using split mode (split ratio 1:10).
