0: Quantitative analysis of the lemongrass essential oil was performed in triplicate on a Shimadzu gas chromatograph model GC-17A equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID; Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Kansai, Japan), using chromatographic conditions: a fused silica capillary column (30 m  0.22 mm) with a DB-5 bound phase (0.25 m film thickness); column pressure 110 kPa; helium carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.8 mL min 1; injector temperature 205 C; detector temperature of 260 C; column temperature programmed to start at 40 C (isothermal remaining for 2 min) and increased from 3 C min 1 to 260 C (isotherm remaining at 260 C, for 10 min).
1: A sample of 1 L (1%  w/v in dichloromethane) was injected, using split mode (split ratio 1:10).
