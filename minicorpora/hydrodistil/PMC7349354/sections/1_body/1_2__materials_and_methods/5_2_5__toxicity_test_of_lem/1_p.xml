<p>Terpenoids of lemongrass essential oil, including citral and geranyl acetate, were purchased from Merck KGaA (Darmstadt, Germany). Lemongrass essential oil, citral, and geranyl acetate were diluted in 10 mL of acetone to obtain six doses (1.56, 3.12, 6.25, 12.5, 25, and 50 µg·insect
 <sup>−1</sup>). Serial doses and a control (acetone) were used to determine the dose–response relationship and estimate lethal doses. Each dose solution (1 µL) was applied on the bodies of 50 newly-emerged (24-hour-old) 
 <italic>S. granarius</italic> adults using a Hamilton microsyringe (model 7001, KH Hamilton Storage GmbH, Domat/Ems, Switzerland). The insects were placed individually in glass vials (20 × 100 mm), covered with a piece of organza, and fed on wheat grains. Three replicates of 50 weevils were used for each dose. The experimental design was completely randomized. The number of dead insects was recorded after 24 h of exposure. Insects were considered dead if unable to walk when prodded with a fine hair brush.
