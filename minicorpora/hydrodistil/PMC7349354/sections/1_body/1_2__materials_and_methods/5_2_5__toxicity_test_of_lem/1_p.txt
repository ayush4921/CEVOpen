0: Terpenoids of lemongrass essential oil, including citral and geranyl acetate, were purchased from Merck KGaA (Darmstadt, Germany).
1: Lemongrass essential oil, citral, and geranyl acetate were diluted in 10 mL of acetone to obtain six doses (1.56, 3.12, 6.25, 12.5, 25, and 50 ginsect 1).
2: Serial doses and a control (acetone) were used to determine the doseresponse relationship and estimate lethal doses.
3: Each dose solution (1 L) was applied on the bodies of 50 newly-emerged (24-hour-old)  S. granarius adults using a Hamilton microsyringe (model 7001, KH Hamilton Storage GmbH, Domat/Ems, Switzerland).
4: The insects were placed individually in glass vials (20  100 mm), covered with a piece of organza, and fed on wheat grains.
5: Three replicates of 50 weevils were used for each dose.
6: The experimental design was completely randomized.
7: The number of dead insects was recorded after 24 h of exposure.
8: Insects were considered dead if unable to walk when prodded with a fine hair brush.
