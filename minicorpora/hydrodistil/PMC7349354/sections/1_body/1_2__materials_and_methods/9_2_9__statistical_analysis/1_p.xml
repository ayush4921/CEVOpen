<p>The toxicity data were submitted to Probit analysis to obtain a dose-mortality curve [
 <xref rid="B46-insects-11-00379" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The time–mortality data were analyzed for survival analysis (Kaplan–Meier estimators, log-rank test) with the Origin Pro 9.1 software (OriginLab Corporation, Northampton, MA, USA). Respiration rate data were submitted to two-way ANOVA and Tukey’s HSD test (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Behavioral repellency response (walked distance and resting time) data were submitted to one-way ANOVA, and a Tukey’s HSD (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) test was also used for comparison of means. Respiration rate and behavioral repellency response were arcsine-transformed to meet assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity. Statistical procedures were analyzed by SAS 9.0 software (SAS Institute, Campus Drive Cary, NC, USA).
