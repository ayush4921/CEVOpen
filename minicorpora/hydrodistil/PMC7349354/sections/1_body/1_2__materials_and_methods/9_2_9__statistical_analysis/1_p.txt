0: The toxicity data were submitted to Probit analysis to obtain a dose-mortality curve [ 46].
1: The timemortality data were analyzed for survival analysis (KaplanMeier estimators, log-rank test) with the Origin Pro 9.1 software (OriginLab Corporation, Northampton, MA, USA).
2: Respiration rate data were submitted to two-way ANOVA and Tukeys HSD test ( p< 0.05).
3: Behavioral repellency response (walked distance and resting time) data were submitted to one-way ANOVA, and a Tukeys HSD ( p< 0.05) test was also used for comparison of means.
4: Respiration rate and behavioral repellency response were arcsine-transformed to meet assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity.
5: Statistical procedures were analyzed by SAS 9.0 software (SAS Institute, Campus Drive Cary, NC, USA).
