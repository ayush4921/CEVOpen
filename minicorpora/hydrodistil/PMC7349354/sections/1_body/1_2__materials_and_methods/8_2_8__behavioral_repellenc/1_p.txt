0: Adults of  S. granarius were placed in Petri dishes (90 mm diameter), with filter paper discs (Whatman TM, Fisher Scientific, Leicestershire, LE, UK) at the bottom of the plate used as arenas.
1: Half of the arena was treated with 250 L of lemongrass essential oil and their components at the LD 50 or LD 90, and the other half with acetone and air-dried for five min [ 44].
2: An  S. granarius was released in the center of the arena and monitored for 10 min.
3: Twenty (Males/females, 1 ratio) insects were used and the experimental design was completely randomized.
4: Behavioral repellency was recorded using a Canon digital camcorder model XL1 3CCD NTSC (Canon, Tokyo, Japan) with a 16X video lens (ZoomXL 5.588 mm, Canon, Tokyo, Japan).
5: The measurement of the distance walked and time spent on each half-arena were obtained with the aid of a video tracking system (ViewPoint Life Sciences, Montreal, Canada).
6: Weevils that spent<1 min or 50% of the time in the half-arena treated with components were considered repelled or irritated, respectively [ 44, 45].
