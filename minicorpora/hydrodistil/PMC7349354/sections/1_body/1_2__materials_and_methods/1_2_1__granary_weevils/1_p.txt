0: A  S. granarius population, resistant to phosphine, was obtained from the Department of Grain Sciences and Industry of the Kansas State University (Manhattan, KS, USA) and used to demonstrate susceptibility to lemongrass essential oil.
1: The population was frequently checked for levels of phosphine resistance [ 37], and reared in the Institute of Applied Biotechnology for Agriculture (BIOAGRO) of the Federal University of Vicosa (UFV) in the county of Vicosa (2045 S 4252 W), State of Minas Gerais, Brazil.
2: Larvae and adults of  S. granaries, free of insecticide residues, were placed in glass bottles (1000 mL) maintained in an acclimatized room at 26  1 C, 65  15% RH, and a 12:12 h (light:dark) photoperiod.
3: These insects were fed on pasta and wheat grains ad libitum.
4: Newly emerged  S. granarius adults (from infested wheat grains) that were 24 hours old were used in the experiments.
