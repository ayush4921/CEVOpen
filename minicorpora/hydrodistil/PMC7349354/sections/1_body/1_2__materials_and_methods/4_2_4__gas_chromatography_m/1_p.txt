0: The identification of lemongrass essential oil components was performed with GC/MS mass-coupled gas chromatograph (CGMS-QP 5050A; Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Kansai, Japan).
1: One L of essential oil containing 1% dichloromethane was injected in the splitless mode (1:10 ratio).
2: The gas carrier used was helium, with 1.8 mL 1 constant flow rate on an Rtx -5MS fused silica capillary column (30 m, 0.25  0.25 mm; Restek Corporation, Bellefonte, PA, USA), using the Crossbond  stationary phase (35% diphenyl and 65% dimethyl polysiloxane).
3: The initial temperature of the injector and detector was 40 C, for 3 min, with a temperature increase from 3 C/min to 300 C and held for 25 min.
4: For mass spectrometer detection, an electron ionization mode with ionization energy of 70 eV was programmed to detect masses in the range of 29600 Da.
5: Lemongrass oil components were identified using their Kovats indexes from original literature [ 39, 40, 41], by comparisons of their mass spectra and retention times with those of (C 3C 24)  n-alkanes and mass spectral data deposited in the Wiley 07 Spectroteca and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST08 and NIST11) databases.
