<p>The identification of lemongrass essential oil components was performed with GC/MS mass-coupled gas chromatograph (CGMS-QP 5050A; Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Kansai, Japan). One µL of essential oil containing 1% dichloromethane was injected in the splitless mode (1:10 ratio). The gas carrier used was helium, with 1.8 mL
 <sup>−1</sup> constant flow rate on an Rtx
 <sup>®</sup>-5MS fused silica capillary column (30 m, 0.25 × 0.25 mm; Restek Corporation, Bellefonte, PA, USA), using the Crossbond
 <sup>®</sup> stationary phase (35% diphenyl and 65% dimethyl polysiloxane). The initial temperature of the injector and detector was 40 °C, for 3 min, with a temperature increase from 3 °C/min to 300 °C and held for 25 min. For mass spectrometer detection, an electron ionization mode with ionization energy of 70 eV was programmed to detect masses in the range of 29–600 Da. Lemongrass oil components were identified using their Kovats indexes from original literature [
