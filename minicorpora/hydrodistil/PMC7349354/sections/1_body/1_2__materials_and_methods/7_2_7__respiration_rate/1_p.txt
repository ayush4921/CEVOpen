0: Respiration rate of  S. granarius adults was evaluated for 3 h after exposure to LD 50 and LD 90 essential oil and its components.
1: The granary weevils treated with acetone were used as the control group.
2: The respirometry measurement was detected with a TR3C CO 2 analyzer (Sable System International, Las Vegas, NV, USA) and recorded by a data acquisition system (ExpeData, Sable System International) using the methodology adapted from previous studies [ 42, 43].
3: For CO 2 quantification, a  S. granarius adult was placed in a respirometry chamber (25 mL) and the chamber was connected to a closed air system.
4: Then, the gas in the respiratory chamber was pumped to the O 2 and CO 2 analyzers, and compared with those from the control.
5: To quantify the CO 2 produced inside each chamber, an airstream scrubbed compressed O 2 via drietite/acarite column was pumped through the chamber at a flow of 100 mL min 1 for 2 min.
6: Sitophilus granarius adults were weighed on a Shimadzu analytical balance model AY220 (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) before and after the test.
7: Sixteen completely randomized replicates were used to evaluate essential oil, components, and control.
