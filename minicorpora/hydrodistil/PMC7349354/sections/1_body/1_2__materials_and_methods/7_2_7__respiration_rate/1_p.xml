<p>Respiration rate of 
 <italic>S. granarius</italic> adults was evaluated for 3 h after exposure to LD
 <sub>50</sub> and LD
 <sub>90</sub> essential oil and its components. The granary weevils treated with acetone were used as the control group. The respirometry measurement was detected with a TR3C CO
 <sub>2</sub> analyzer (Sable System International, Las Vegas, NV, USA) and recorded by a data acquisition system (ExpeData, Sable System International) using the methodology adapted from previous studies [

 <sub>2</sub> quantification, a 
 <italic>S. granarius</italic> adult was placed in a respirometry chamber (25 mL) and the chamber was connected to a closed air system. Then, the gas in the respiratory chamber was pumped to the O
 <sub>2</sub> and CO
 <sub>2</sub> analyzers, and compared with those from the control. To quantify the CO
 <sub>2</sub> produced inside each chamber, an airstream scrubbed compressed O
 <sub>2</sub> via drietite/acarite column was pumped through the chamber at a flow of 100 mL min
 <sup>âˆ’1</sup> for 2 min. 
 <italic>Sitophilus granarius</italic> adults were weighed on a Shimadzu analytical balance model AY220 (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) before and after the test. Sixteen completely randomized replicates were used to evaluate essential oil, components, and control.
