0: Plant essential oils have different properties such as biodegradability, selectivity to target pests, and can reduce the use of conventional insecticides [ 12, 13].
1: Plant essential oils are volatile substances obtained from flowers, fruits, leaves, roots, and stems through steam or hydrodistillation.
2: Plant essential oils are composited by alcohols, aldehydes, aromatic phenols, esters, ethers, ketones, oxides, and terpenoids (monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes), and determine the aroma of the donor plant [ 14, 15].
3: They are used for the food industry [ 16], pharmacology [ 17], medicine [ 18], and agriculture [ 19].
4: Terpenoids have been documented to cause toxicity or repellency against some insects [ 12, 20].
5: In addition, plant essential oils are an ecofriendly alternative to controlling stored product pests because they do not penetrate the insect cuticle and grains [ 21, 22].
