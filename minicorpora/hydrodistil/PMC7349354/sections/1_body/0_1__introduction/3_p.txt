0: Essential oils and their components cause toxic effects in insects via contact, ingestion, or fumigation.
1: In this context, indirect effects such as deterrence, feeding inhibition, and repellency have been studied [ 13, 22, 23].
2: These components act on the central nervous system, affecting acetylcholine, -aminobutyric acid, and octopaminergic receptors, as well as some respiratory pathways [ 24, 25, 26, 27].
3: The efficacy of essential oils and their chemical components is described in coleopteran pests of stored grain, with successful results for  Acanthoscelides obtectus Say (Coleoptera: Bruchidae) in response to exposure to mint oil [ 28],  Sitophilus granarius Linnaeus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) exposed to cinnamon oil [ 29], and  Tenebrio molitor Linnaeus (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) exposed to garlic oil [ 21].
4: Within this chemical component group, essential oils are a broad-spectrum insecticide active on starches and storage pests [ 11].
