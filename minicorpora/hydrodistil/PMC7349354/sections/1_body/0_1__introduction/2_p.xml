 <xref rid="B13-insects-11-00379" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Plant essential oils are volatile substances obtained from flowers, fruits, leaves, roots, and stems through steam or hydrodistillation. Plant essential oils are composited by alcohols, aldehydes, aromatic phenols, esters, ethers, ketones, oxides, and terpenoids (monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes), and determine the aroma of the donor plant [
