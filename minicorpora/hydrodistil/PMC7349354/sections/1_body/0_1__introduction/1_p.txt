0: Chemical synthetic insecticides are used to control insects in stored grain facilities.
1: Phosphine is commonly used in noxious gas form to control stored product pests worldwide [ 1].
2: Other alternative chemical methods to fumigants consist of protectants with long residual efficacies that target a broad spectrum of species [ 2].
3: Insecticides such as pirimiphos-methyl, spinetoram, and spinosad are grain protectants and provide a rapid, lethal effect in stored product pests [ 3, 4, 5].
4: However, these insecticides cause environmental pollution [ 6], atmosphere ozone-depletion [ 7], toxic waste [ 8], have a long residual period of toxicity [ 9], and have documented insecticide resistance [ 1].
5: Among the alternative strategies to insecticides, the use of plant essential oils has been proposed for insect control in stored grains [ 10, 11].
