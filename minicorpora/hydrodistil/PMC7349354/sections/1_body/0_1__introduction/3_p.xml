<p>Essential oils and their components cause toxic effects in insects via contact, ingestion, or fumigation. In this context, indirect effects such as deterrence, feeding inhibition, and repellency have been studied [

 <xref rid="B23-insects-11-00379" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. These components act on the central nervous system, affecting acetylcholine, Î³-aminobutyric acid, and octopaminergic receptors, as well as some respiratory pathways [
