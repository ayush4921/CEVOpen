<p>Chemical synthetic insecticides are used to control insects in stored grain facilities. Phosphine is commonly used in noxious gas form to control stored product pests worldwide [

 <xref rid="B2-insects-11-00379" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Insecticides such as pirimiphos-methyl, spinetoram, and spinosad are grain protectants and provide a rapid, lethal effect in stored product pests [
