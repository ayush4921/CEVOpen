<p>This study shows the potential of lemongrass essential oil, citral, and geranyl acetate as an insecticide or repellent IPM approach to manage 
 <italic>S. granarius</italic>. These compounds caused significant effects on the mortality, respiration depletion, and repellency in this pest of stored grains. Additionally, the insecticide effects of lemongrass essential oil can be due to the synergism of components and their ability to penetrate the insect body or through the respiratory system. Lemongrass essential oil, citral, and geranyl acetate have toxic and sublethal effects on 
 <italic>S. granarius</italic> and can be an alternative to synthetic chemical insecticides.
