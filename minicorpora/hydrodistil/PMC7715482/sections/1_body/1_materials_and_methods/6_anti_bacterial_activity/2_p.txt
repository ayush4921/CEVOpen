0: The agar well diffusion experiment method was used to detect the anti-bacterial activity of MDRs  K. pneumoniae in the presence of chitosan loaded plant essential and followed by previous reports of  Rajivgandhi et al., 2018.
1: The muller hinton agar plates were used to check the anti-bacterial activity in our study.
2: After complete solidification, 5 mm gap between the wells were made aseptically using sterile gel borer, which had been previously swabbed with 24 h old  K. pneumoniae culture.
3: Then, various concentration of chitosan loaded essential oil was added into the cutted wells and maintained at room temperature 1 day.
4: After incubation, the plates were taken and observed the diameter zones of the wells.
5: The inhibition zone of the wells were measured in diameter and noted.
