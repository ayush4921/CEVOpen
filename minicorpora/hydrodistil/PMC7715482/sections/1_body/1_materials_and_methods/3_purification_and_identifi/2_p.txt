0: Hydrodistillation method is the best method to purify and quantify the essential oil from plant and it also one of the universally approved method ( Rajivgandhi et al., 2020a,  Rajivgandhi et al., 2020b).
1: Briefly, the collected leaves were dried after surface sterilization with DH 2O and maintained 15 days in dark condition.
2: The dried plant leaves were ground by using master and pestle for nice powder.
3: The nice thin content of the plant powder was performed to hydrodistillation 12 h in Clevengers apparatus.
4: After 12 h, the essential oil was collected and separated the organic and aqueous phase.
5: Finally, the organic phase of was dried over using sodium anhydrous sulphate and stored at 4 C for further use.
6: After, the crude essential oil powder was mixed into methanol (99%) to dissolve the powder.
7: Consequently, the sample was analyzed by using HRLC-MS (Model 6745, Agilent Technology, CA, America) for complete analysis of the powder content including phytochemical compounds, proteins, amino acids, nutrients and bioactive compounds.
8: The HRLC-MS was connected with DB-5 colomn 925  0.22 mm), the film thickness was used as o.
9: 30 m. The software was fitted by turbo mass gold mass spectrometer.
10: The injector temperature was maintained at 240 C. The temperatures of 40 C and 240 C were set initially and finally respectively.
11: The injected volume and helium carrier gas was designed as 1 mL and 1 mL /m respectively.
12: The solution of methanol was used for analysis.
13: In addition, the 100 K Pa of pressure, 70 eV of energy, 1000 rate of decomposition and 0.50 range of decomposition were set.
14: After successful completion of program, the instrument was run and allowed 4 h for complete analysis.
15: After completion of the program, the available chemical constituents of the compounds were noted.
16: The resulted chemical constituents were compared with Wiley library database of the Bharathidasan University NIST and confirm the available compounds.
