<p id="p0030">The identified essential oil was loaded with chitosan molecules by using two step nanoencapsulaiton process including oil-in water emulsification and ionic gelation method. The method was followed by previously reported evidence of 
 <xref rid="b0215" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al. (2020)</xref> with some alterations. Equal volume of chitosan solution, 1% of oil and acetic acid 1: 1 ratio (1% w/v of chitosan + 1% v/v acetic acid) were taken and dissolved completely by using ultra sonicator (Suresh Scientific@Co, Tiruchirappalli, India) at 1 h. The diluted mixture was filtered by using whatman NO.1 filter paper and removes the undissolved materials. After, tween 80 solutions were added in to 50 mL of filtered chitosan solution. The pH was maintained at 4.2 with the help of 1 N NaOH solution. The mixture was further sonicated and received the homogeneous solution after two hours’ time interval. Required quantity of purified essential oil was gradually added on the wall of the tubes constantly at the time of homogenization with 1000 rpm for 10 min. After, the sample was constantly maintained in ice-both conditions for make the oil-in-water emulsion. Next, the cross linker of sodium tripolyphosphate (TPP) was added gradually to stimulate the ionic gelation of chitosan. The agitation was maintained constantly with 30 min and formed particles were collected. Then, the formed particles were centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the purified suspensions were washed three times using deionized water. Finally, the collected suspensions were dried immediately −30 °C for 1 h using freez drier (Cryodos 50/230 V, Telstar, Madrid, Spain).
