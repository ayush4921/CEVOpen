0: The identified essential oil was loaded with chitosan molecules by using two step nanoencapsulaiton process including oil-in water emulsification and ionic gelation method.
1: The method was followed by previously reported evidence of  Zhang et al.
2: (2020) with some alterations.
3: Equal volume of chitosan solution, 1% of oil and acetic acid 1: 1 ratio (1% w/v of chitosan + 1% v/v acetic acid) were taken and dissolved completely by using ultra sonicator (Suresh Scientific@Co, Tiruchirappalli, India) at 1 h. The diluted mixture was filtered by using whatman NO.1 filter paper and removes the undissolved materials.
4: After, tween 80 solutions were added in to 50 mL of filtered chitosan solution.
5: The pH was maintained at 4.2 with the help of 1 N NaOH solution.
6: The mixture was further sonicated and received the homogeneous solution after two hours time interval.
7: Required quantity of purified essential oil was gradually added on the wall of the tubes constantly at the time of homogenization with 1000 rpm for 10 min.
8: After, the sample was constantly maintained in ice-both conditions for make the oil-in-water emulsion.
9: Next, the cross linker of sodium tripolyphosphate (TPP) was added gradually to stimulate the ionic gelation of chitosan.
10: The agitation was maintained constantly with 30 min and formed particles were collected.
11: Then, the formed particles were centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 30 min at 4 C. After centrifugation, the purified suspensions were washed three times using deionized water.
12: Finally, the collected suspensions were dried immediately 30 C for 1 h using freez drier (Cryodos 50/230 V, Telstar, Madrid, Spain).
