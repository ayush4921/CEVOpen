0: The minimum inhibition concentration effect of synthesized chitosan loaded essential oil sample was detected by 96-well microtiter plate followed by the earliest report of  Yilmaz et al.
1: (2019).
2: Briefly, 24 h staled  K. pneumonia culture was diluted into the 96-well plate containing fresh tryptic soy broth.
3: After dilution, different concentration of chitosan loaded essential oil solution was added into respective wells.
4: Whereas, without addition of the chitosan loaded essential oil containing well acted as a control.
5: The plate was maintained at room temperature for one day.
6: After incubation, the turbidity of the wells was observed on the naked eye and lowest concentration of the well that shown with higher turbidity of the well was confirmed as minimum inhibition concentration.
7: This minimum inhibition effect was converted to percentages using universal formula, Inhibition%=Controlresult-Testresult/Controlresult100.
