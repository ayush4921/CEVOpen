<p id="p0065">After careful purification through hydro-distillation method using Clevenger apparatus, the highest yield of the Guva leaves were obtained approximately 15.5 mL/l. The obtained essential oil was exhibited with whitish color and available phytochemicals, proteins, amino acid, and other compounds were observed by HRLC-MS peaks of 
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. Among the peaks, the anti-microbial activity compounds were screened. All the screened compounds were identified based on the retention time, occupied area and occupied percentages. Among the entire identified compounds, there are 13 antimicrobial compounds were identified from previous reports (
 <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">Paula et al., 2011</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0215" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>, and our identified compounds may also have anti-bacterial activity against tested 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>. Some of the major compounds are phytochemical derivatives; they are also listed including thujene, ɑ-pinene, β-pinene, sabinene, cubenol, P-aucubin and L-scopoletin. Therefore our result was indicated that the anti-microbial ability of the bioactive compounds and phytochemicals compounds were highly present in the Guva essential oil. The result was agreed by previous report of 
 <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">Chaturvedi et al. (2019)</xref> and Guva essential oil was one of the important sources for biological activities. Recently, 
 <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">Joseph and Priya (2010)</xref>, was reported that the purified guva essential oils have more anti-bacterial and anti-cancer activity against multi drug resistant bacteria and cancer cells. Usually, the traditional medicinal plants have increased bioactive compounds and phytochemical derivatives. In addition, the more alkaloid and flavonoid derivatives are also present in the essential oil derived compounds (

 <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">Garode and Waghode (2014)</xref> documented that the traditional medicinal plant derived essential oils have rich phenolic and flavonoid content; it may be leads to high anti-oxidant activity. Sometimes, the phyto-chemical derivatives and bioactive compounds were presented in different ratio due to the various environmental factors including pH, temperature, salt content, and genetic factors, nutritional status, harvesting time as well as the organs used for EO extraction (
 <xref rid="b0080" ref-type="bibr">Joseph and Priya, 2011</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">Farhana et al., 2017</xref>). Finally, our result was confirmed that the Guva leaves derived essential oils have enormous bioactive compounds and phytochemical derivatives with increased biological activity.
