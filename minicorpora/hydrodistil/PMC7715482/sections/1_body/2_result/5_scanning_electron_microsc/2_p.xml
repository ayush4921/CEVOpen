<p id="p0080">Scanning electron microscopic analysis is an important tool for analysis of morphology and particle size of the chitosan; chitosan loaded essential oils (

 <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">Rajivgandhi et al., 2019a</xref>). In result, the chitosan nanoparticle was exhibited with spherical shape with smooth morphology and various sizes. In addition, the resulted morphological mediated chitosan was exhibited with uniform particles, and their average size was 40–96 nm. After loading with essential oil, when compared with chitosan alone (
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>a), the chitosan loaded essential oil morphology (
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>b) of was shown with swelling in inside the chitosan layer, it surrounded by individual particles (

In addition, the result was suggested that the essential oil was combined and melted with chitosan with each other, which might have the presence of some essential oil content on the chitosan surface. It exhibited that the chitosan may decreased slightly and increased the essential oil content (

 <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">Hadidi et al. (2020)</xref> and the swelling and aggregation variation between the chitosan alone and chitosan loaded essential oils.
