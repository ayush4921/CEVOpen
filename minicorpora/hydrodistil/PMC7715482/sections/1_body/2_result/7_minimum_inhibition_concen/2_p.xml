<p id="p0090">The anti-bacterial activity of the chitosan loaded essential oil was further confirmed by using minimum inhibition concentration assay. In this assay, we have found the minimum concentration of the chitosan loaded essential oil against tested 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> by 96-well plate assay. After 24 h incubation, the 96-well plates were showed with more turbidity at increasing concentration. When the concentration was increased that the inhibition activity also increased in 96-well plates of treated wells (
 <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">Deepika et al., 2019</xref>). The result was indicated that the chitosan loaded essential oil has antibacterial activity at lowest concentration. When, the diluted sample at 10 µg/mL, the chitosan loaded essential oil found with 13% inhibition rate against tested 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>. The half minimum inhibition concentration of 52% was exhibited at 60 µg/mL concentration and the complete inhibition of 96% was inhibited at 100 µg/mL concentration. This concentration was very lowest concentration compare with previous study. Therefore, the lowest concentration of 100 µg/mL was fixed as a minimum inhibition concentration for this study (

 <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">Alharbi and Alarfaj (2020)</xref>, and the chitosan loaded essential oil improved the anti-bacterial activity and exhibited the result with very lowest concentration. Previous reported documents were agreed this study result, and stated that the minimum concentration of chitosan loaded essential oil has excellent inhibition activity against various bacteria. Recently,

 <xref rid="b0190" ref-type="bibr">TchindaIgor et al., 2017</xref>, reported that the minimum inhibition concentration method was one of the best method for identification of lowest concentration.
