0: Chemically, when the process of deacetylation process, the weaker hydrogen bonds of chitin are linked with N-acetyl glucosamine chins and formed as a chitosan, which possesses positively charged amino groups when it diluted in acidic solvent ( Mishra et al., 2018,  Rajivgandhi et al., 2019b).
1: Chitosan is formed with the help of negatively charged crosslinking agents in the natural polymers moieties of itself through intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds ( Karimirad et al., 2019).
2: When the synthesis process, chitosan beads is acted as a stable loading system, but it depends on the size and types of the crosslinking agents ( Topuz and Uyar, 2020).
3: The universal crosslinking agent is sodium tripolyphosphate (TPP), which is used in nanoencapsulation, even formed capsules are labile in the aqueous system based on the pH and ionic strength ( Rajkumar et al., 2020).
4: Basically, it shows on rod-like, crystal structures with larger surface area and hold the negatively charged sulphate groups on the cellulose backbone due to the process of hydrolysis.
5: It can be formed as polymeric matrix with the mechanical behavior.
6: Previously, this process is increased the rigid film matrix without stable condition for improved antimicrobial and mechanical properties ( Tatiana et al., 2018).
