0: Free volatiles of the genus  Veronica are not very well studied.
1: To our knowledge,  V. saturejoides ssp.
2: saturejoides has not yet been studied, which encouraged our team to study free volatile components of this endemic species, especially in terms of comparing volatile components from essential oil (EO) and from water residues, and to test the antioxidant activity of these extracts, since this species grows under extreme environmental conditions and we assumed that it develops volatile components that could have antioxidant activity.
3: In this research, volatile substances are extracted from glandular trichomes, which are later shown in the pictures.
4: Free volatiles were isolated in lipophilic and water fraction.
5: Water fractions or hydrosols are condensed water vapors containing dissolved molecules of EOs and more water-soluble (polar) volatile compounds [ 12].
6: Due to the different solubility of the volatile compounds in water, the overall composition and thus the biological activity of the hydrosol differs from lipophilic fraction or essential oil.
7: Hydrosols are often discarded after the EO extraction process.
8: However, research has shown that these waste products are rich in biologically active substances [ 12].
9: Hydrosols from various plants are becoming increasingly important in the food industry, the cosmetics industry, the application of plant pesticides, traditional pharmaceuticals, in aromatherapy as part of complex formulations and as independent products; therefore, their potential use should be further investigated [ 13].
