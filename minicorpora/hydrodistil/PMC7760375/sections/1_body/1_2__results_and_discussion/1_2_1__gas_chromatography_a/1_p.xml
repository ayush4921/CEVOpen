<p>Two samples of EO and hydrosol obtained from 
 <italic>V. saturejoides</italic> ssp. 
 <italic>saturejoides</italic> were analyzed. The results are presented in 
 <xref rid="plants-09-01646-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The yield of EO for two samples, Prenj (PS) and Kame≈°nica (KS), was 0.07% and 0.03% respectively. This endemic species is rich in volatile compounds that have been studied in oils and hydrosols. The compounds are listed in the order of their elution from the column (
 <xref rid="plants-09-01646-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In total, the class of oxygenated sesquiterpenes (PS 54.25% and KS 36.46%) and the group of fatty aldehydes, acids and alcoholic compounds (PS 17.4% and KS 43.85%) dominate in the oils, if one considers the results obtained. Within the hydrosol, the oxygenated monoterpenes (PS 31.75% and KS 40%) and the sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (PS 36.46% and KS 34.53%) dominate (
