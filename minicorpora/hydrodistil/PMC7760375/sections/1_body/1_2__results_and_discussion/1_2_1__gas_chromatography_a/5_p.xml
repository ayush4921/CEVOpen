<p>In the previously investigated 
 <italic>Veronica spicata</italic> L., phytol was the dominant compound (21.13%) in the total EO [
 <xref rid="B9-plants-09-01646" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In this research phytol was only present in the PS essential oil (
 <xref rid="plants-09-01646-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) (2.82%). A further comparison of the compounds found in 
 <italic>V. spicata</italic> L. and 
 <italic>V. saturejoides</italic> shows that nine compounds were found in both plant species: (E)-caryophyllene, spathulenol, caryophyllene oxide, γ- eudesmol, phytol, docosane, tricosane, tetracosane and pentacosane. Li (2002) [
 <xref rid="B23-plants-09-01646" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] identified essential oil components of 
 <italic>V. linariifolia</italic> Pall. ex Link and found that the main components were cyclohexene (25.83%), β-pinene (11.61%), 1S-α-pinene (10.65%), β-phellandrene (10.49%), β-myrcene (10.42%), and germacrene D (4.99%). If we compare these results with ours, we can conclude that EO of 
 <italic>V. saturejoides</italic> is richer in oxygenated sesquiterpenes and 
 <italic>V. linariifolia</italic> in sesquiterpene hydrocarbons. Çelik et al. investigated EOs extracted from 
 <italic>Veronica</italic> sp. and found that the main components were mainly linalool (4.18%) and carvacrol (7.28%) [
 <xref rid="B24-plants-09-01646" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Research on free volatile compounds of the genus 
 <italic>Veronica</italic> is very scarce, therefore it is important that our research is supported by the micromorphology of trichomes as a visible evidence of the place of synthesis of free volatile compounds.
