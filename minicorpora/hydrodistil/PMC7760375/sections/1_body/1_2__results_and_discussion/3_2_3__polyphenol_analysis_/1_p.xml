<p>Plant polyphenols are natural biologically active compounds that can also be synthesized in the laboratory. They have been shown to be good antioxidants, anti-neurodegenerative and anticancer agents [

 <xref rid="plants-09-01646-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, the highest content was found for total phenolic acids in 
 <italic>V. saturejoides</italic> ssp. 
 <italic>saturejoides</italic> (Kamešnica-KS; 1; A525 nm), while the yield of total flavonoids (TF) was found to be very low and the same for both investigated specimens of 
 <italic>V. saturejoides</italic> ssp. 
 <italic>saturejoides</italic> (
 <xref rid="plants-09-01646-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Harput et al. found that total phenolic content was 200.20 mg/g in 
 <italic>V. officinalis</italic> L., 139.92 mg/g in 
 <italic>V. peduncularis</italic> M. Bieb., 127.64 mg/g in 
 <italic>V. orientalis</italic> Mill., and 83.15 mg/g in 
 <italic>V. baranetzkii</italic> Bordz. [
 <xref rid="B36-plants-09-01646" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Comparing these results with ours, it can be seen that 
 <italic>V. saturejoides</italic> has a similar total phenolic content to 
 <italic>V. baranetzkii</italic>. Ertas et al. found that the total phenolic content in methanolic extracts of 
 <italic>V. thymoides</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>pseudocinerea</italic> was 248.37 ± 3.68 mg/g and that total flavonoid content was 47.02 ± 0.21 mg/g [
