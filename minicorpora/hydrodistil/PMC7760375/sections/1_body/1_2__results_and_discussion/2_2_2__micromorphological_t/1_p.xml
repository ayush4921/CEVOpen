<p>In general, micromorphological investigations of 
 <italic>Veronica</italic> species are rare, so we have decided to conduct the micromorphological research on this plant to find site of essential oil production. On the stems, leaves, and the calyces of 
 <italic>V. saturejoides</italic> non-glandular and glandular trichomes could be observed. According to scanning electron microscope (SEM) investigation, non-glandular trichomes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01646-f002">Figure 2</xref>a,b,g,h) were unbranched, bi-cellular to multicellular, uniseriate, and folded at different levels. They could be noted as attenuate trichomes [
 <xref rid="B17-plants-09-01646" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The length of these trichomes varied from very short to long trichomes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01646-f002">Figure 2</xref>g,h). These trichomes protect the plant from water loss and maintain the positive microclimate. The surfaces of these trichomes showed a warty appearance due to the occurrence of cuticular micropapillae (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01646-f002">Figure 2</xref>g,h). Leaves and flowers were sparsely covered by non-glandular trichomes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01646-f002">Figure 2</xref>aâ€“f), while the stem was characterized by a relatively dense indumentum of these trichomes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01646-f002">Figure 2</xref>g,h). The existence of non-glandular trichomes on flower parts of 
 <italic>Veronica</italic> species was mentioned 100 years ago by Kurer [
 <xref rid="B26-plants-09-01646" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Additionally, Kraehmer and Baur described these trichomes in 
 <italic>V. persica</italic> Poir [
 <xref rid="B27-plants-09-01646" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The same type of non-glandular trichomes is common in many other Lamiaceae species [
