<p>Glandular capitate trichomes could be observed on stems, leaves, and the calyces of 
 <italic>V. saturejoides</italic> ssp. 
 <italic>saturejoides</italic>. These trichomes were composed of one stalk cell and two elliptically formed head cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01646-f002">Figure 2</xref>e). They were not upright, and could be described as clinging to the surface. All investigated plant parts were sparsely covered by capitate trichomes. The same type of capitate trichomes was noticed in 
 <italic>V. beccabunga</italic> L. [
 <xref rid="B31-plants-09-01646" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Likewise, an inclined trichome type with a bicellular head was reported in 
 <italic>Stachys recta</italic> L. subsp. 
 <italic>recta</italic> by Vundac et al. [
 <xref rid="B32-plants-09-01646" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Comparable capitate trichomes with only one elliptically formed head cell could be observed on SEM micrographs of 
 <italic>Marrubium vulgare</italic> L. (Lamiaceae) in research by Haratym and Weryszko-Chmielewska [
 <xref rid="B28-plants-09-01646" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Moreover, Hanlidou et al. described a similar trichome type (“short and ordinarily bent”) in 
 <italic>Calamintha menthifolia</italic> Host. [
 <xref rid="B33-plants-09-01646" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Kremer et al. also found an inclined trichome type with one head cell in 
 <italic>Micromeria croatica</italic> (Pers.) Schott [
 <xref rid="B34-plants-09-01646" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Although the yield of EO was considerably higher in PS (0.07%) than in KS (0.03%), the micrographs did not show any significant difference between the samples for the number of capitate trichomes on calyces and leaves (
 <xref rid="plants-09-01646-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01646-f002">Figure 2</xref>c–f). A slightly higher number of capitate trichomes was found on stems from PS (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01646-f002">Figure 2</xref>g). The obtained difference in EO yield between samples could be due to other reasons, such as climatic conditions or possible mechanical damage of the glandular trichomes.
