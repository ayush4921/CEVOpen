<p>In 
 <xref rid="plants-09-01646-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>, we can see that KS oil from the Kamešnica Mountains showed slightly higher oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) and 2,2′-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) activity. In the polyphenolic analyses in the sample from Prenj Mountain, we could not detect any polyphenols, only in the sample from the Kamešnica Mountain, so we can conclude that this small difference in antioxidant activity could be due to this finding. This is the first report on the antioxidant activity of the free volatiles of 
 <italic>Veronica</italic> species, so we cannot compare it with other results for 
 <italic>Veronica</italic> species, but we can compare our results with other relevant EOs and hydrosols commonly used in food preservation, preservation, pharmacy and cosmetics. In comparison with reports on other plants, Aazza et al. [
 <xref rid="B39-plants-09-01646" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] investigated the ORAC activity of hydrosols of several medicinal plants (
 <italic>Lavandula officinalis, Origanum majorana, Rosmarinus officinalis, Salvia officinalis, Thymus vulgaris, Cinnamomum verum</italic> and 
 <italic>Syzgium aromaticum</italic>). The hydrosol KS tested in our research has higher ORAC activity than 
 <italic>Salvia officinalis</italic> and similar activity to 
 <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B39-plants-09-01646" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Bentayeb et al. [
 <xref rid="B40-plants-09-01646" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] reported antioxidant activity for 10 EOs of the plants often used as spices. ORAC antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>V. saturejoides</italic> according to their reported values has similar activity as rosemary and basil EO. Viuda-Martos et al. [
 <xref rid="B41-plants-09-01646" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] reported antioxidant activity for five plants used in Mediterranean and 
 <italic>V. saturejoides</italic> showed similar DPPH activity to rosemary oil which is in accordance to other reported results [
 <xref rid="B41-plants-09-01646" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Antioxidant activity for metabolites of the genus 
 <italic>Veronica</italic> was mostly tested on different extracts of phenolic compounds and on iridoid glucosides. Harput et al. [
 <xref rid="B42-plants-09-01646" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] tested the DPPH activity of methanolic extracts from fourteen different 
 <italic>Veronica</italic> species and reported the highest antioxidant activity in 
 <italic>V. officinalis</italic> with an IC50 value of 40.93 μg/mL [
 <xref rid="B42-plants-09-01646" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Mocan et al. [
 <xref rid="B43-plants-09-01646" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] confirmed the antioxidant activity for 
 <italic>V. officinalis</italic> with TEAC method 157.99 ± 6.58 mg TE/g. Živković et al. [
 <xref rid="B10-plants-09-01646" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] tested methanolic extracts of 
 <italic>V. teucrium</italic> and 
 <italic>V. jacquinii</italic> and they were stronger than previously reported by Harput et al. [
 <xref rid="B42-plants-09-01646" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] for 
 <italic>V. officinalis</italic>, with IC50 values of 28.49 ± 0.6 for 
 <italic>V. teucrium</italic> and 37.63 ± 0.6 μg/mL for 
 <italic>V. jacquinii</italic>, although both have lower activity than the standard (BHT-butylated hydroxytoluene and BHA-butylated hydroxyanisole) [
 <xref rid="B10-plants-09-01646" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Kwak et al. reported antioxidant activity for iridoid glucosides in which the ethanolic extract showed higher activity than Trolox [
 <xref rid="B44-plants-09-01646" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In our previous study, we tested the DPPH activity of various extracts of 
 <italic>V. spicata</italic>, and the IC50 value showed the highest activity in methanolic extracts of flowers and leaves with values of 8.21 ± 0.06 μg/mL and 8.69 ± 0.06 μg/mL, i.e., higher than the values for standards BHT and BHA according to the values in the study by Živković et al. [
