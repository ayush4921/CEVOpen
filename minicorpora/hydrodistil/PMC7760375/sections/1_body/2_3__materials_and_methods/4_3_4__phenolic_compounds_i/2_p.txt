0: The identification of phenolic compounds in the hydrosols was performed by comparing the retention time with that of the pure standard.
1: The quantification of the phenolic compounds was performed using the calibration curve of the standard and the results were expressed in mg of each phenolic compound per L of the sample.
2: The standard and solvents were of analytical grade, and were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany).
3: Deionized water (Milli-Q) was used for the preparation of all solvents.
