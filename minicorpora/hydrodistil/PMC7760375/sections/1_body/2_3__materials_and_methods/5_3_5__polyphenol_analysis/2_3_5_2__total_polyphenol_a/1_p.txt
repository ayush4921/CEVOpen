0: Total polyphenol (TP) and tannin (T) analysis was based on a reaction with FCR and spectrophotometric determination of TP and T at 720 nm-indirect analysis after precipitation T with casein [ 46, 47].
1: The plant material (0.250 g; above ground parts) was previously extracted with methanol (30%, v/v), using water bath (70 C) for 15 min [ 49, 50].
2: The contents of TP and T in  V. saturejoides extracts were evaluated in three independent analyses and were expressed as mg/g of dry weight of herbal material [ 48, 49] according to equation: A = 1.069cexp.
3: 0.0029  (1) where A is absorbance and cexp.
4: is measured concentration (g/mL).
