0: TF included hydrolysis of glycosides (extraction of 0.20 g of powdered plant material with acetone, 25% HCl and 0.5% hexamethylenetetramine, using boiling water bath for 30 min), then extraction of total flavonoid aglycones with ethyl acetate, and complexation with AlCl 3 [ 51, 52].
1: Absorbance of the yellow complex was measured at 425 nm and concentration was calculated as quercetin using the following equation: % = A  0.772/b; [A = absorbance; b = mass of dry plant material (g)]  (2) where b is mass of the dry plant material (g) and 0.772 represents the conversion factor related to the specific absorbance of quercetin at 425 nm (i.e., 810).
2: TF concentration was measured in three independent analyses and expressed as mg/g of dry weight of herbal material.
