<p>TPA content, expressed as rosmarinic acid (λ = 505 nm), was calculated from the equation:
 <disp-formula>A × 2.5/m; [A = absorbance; m = mass of the substance to be examined (g)]
  <label>(3)</label>
 </disp-formula> where m is mass of the dry plant material (g) and 2.5 represents the conversion factor related to the specific absorbance of rosmarinic acid at 505 nm (i.e., 400).
