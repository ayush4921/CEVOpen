0: For SEM investigation, stem, leaf, and calyx samples were transferred from 70% ethanol to 70% acetone and then further dehydrated (70%, 90% and 100% acetone) and subjected to critical point drying using CO 2 as drying medium (CPD030; Bal-tec, Balzers, Liechtenstein).
1: The samples were then sputtered with gold (Sputter Coater, AGAR) and examined under an XL30 ESEM (FEI) SEM with an acceleration voltage of 20 kV in high vacuum mode [ 46].
2: Common terminology [ 47] was used to describe the trichomes.
