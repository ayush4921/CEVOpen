0: The antioxidant capacity of the extracts was assessed by the DPPH method previously described by Mensor et al.
1: and Payet et al.
2: [ 54, 55].
3: This method is based on the reduction of alcoholic DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) solution (SigmaAldrich) in the presence of a hydrogen-donating antioxidant using 96-well microtiter plates.
4: Plant extracts as described in the ORAC method were used (acetone-dissolved essential oils and absolute hydrosols).
5: We pipetted 100 L methanol (Kemika, Zagreb, Croatia) and 200 L standard and/or sample into each well.
6: We prepared serial dilutions of standard and samples by pipetting 100 L from the first row with a multichannel pipette into the wells in the second row and so on to the last row, where 100 L of the solution is ejected after mixing.
7: In the first column, in 96-well plates, a blank sample was always added.
8: For EOs, the acetone and methanolic solution were used as blank and for hydrosols, water and methanolic solution were used as blank.
9: The reaction starts by adding 100 L of a methanolic solution of DPPH (200 M) to each well.
10: The initial absorbance at 517 nm was measured immediately, using MetOH as blank value.
11: After 60 min incubation, the absorbance was measured again and the percentage of DPPH inhibition was calculated according to the following formula by Yen and Duh [ 56]: % inhibition = ((AC(0)  AA(t))/AC(0))  100, where AC(0) is the absorbance of the control at t = 0 min, and AA(t) is the absorbance of the antioxidant at t = 1 h. All measurements were performed in triplicate.
12: The standard curve was generated by plotting the percentage of inhibition of standard with corresponding mol of Trolox.
13: From the standard curve, results for EOs were expressed as mol of Trolox per g of EO and for hydrosols as mol of Trolox per g of absolute hydrosol.
14: Because of the data from other relevant literature we also expressed IC50 values for EOs expressed in mg/mL.
