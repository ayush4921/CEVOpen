<p>The assay was performed in a Perkin–Elmer LS55 spectrofluorimeter, using 96-well white polystyrene microtiter plates (Porvair Sciences, Leatherhead, UK) according to a method described by Fredotovic et al. [
 <xref rid="B53-plants-09-01646" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], with some adjustments due to different extracts. We had hydrophilic assay for hydrosols and lipophilic assay for EOs. For the hydrophilic assay, each reaction contained 180 µL of fluorescein (1 µM), 70 µL 2,2’-Azobis(2-methyl-propionamidine) dihydrochloride (AAPH, Acros Organics) (300 mM), and 30 µL of plant extracts or reference standard Trolox (6.25–50 µM) (Sigma–Aldrich). For the antioxidant test for hydrosols, all experimental solutions and samples were prepared in a phosphate buffer (0.075 mM, pH 7.0). We used absolute hydrosol and dissolved it in phosphate buffer 20× and 40× for the experiments. For the lipophilic assay, EO were dissolved in acetone (10 mg in 1 mL acetone). The EO acetone dilutions were further dissolved 40× and 80× in the phosphate buffer for the experiments. The measurements were performed in triplicate by a method described in Fredotovic et al. [

The ORAC values of EOs were expressed as μmol of Trolox equivalents (TE) per g of essential oil. The results were obtained from three independent experiments.
