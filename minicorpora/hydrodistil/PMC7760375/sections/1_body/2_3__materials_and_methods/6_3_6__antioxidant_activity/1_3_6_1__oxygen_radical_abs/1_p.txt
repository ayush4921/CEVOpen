0: The assay was performed in a PerkinElmer LS55 spectrofluorimeter, using 96-well white polystyrene microtiter plates (Porvair Sciences, Leatherhead, UK) according to a method described by Fredotovic et al.
1: [ 53], with some adjustments due to different extracts.
2: We had hydrophilic assay for hydrosols and lipophilic assay for EOs.
3: For the hydrophilic assay, each reaction contained 180 L of fluorescein (1 M), 70 L 2,2-Azobis(2-methyl-propionamidine) dihydrochloride (AAPH, Acros Organics) (300 mM), and 30 L of plant extracts or reference standard Trolox (6.2550 M) (SigmaAldrich).
4: For the antioxidant test for hydrosols, all experimental solutions and samples were prepared in a phosphate buffer (0.075 mM, pH 7.0).
5: We used absolute hydrosol and dissolved it in phosphate buffer 20 and 40 for the experiments.
6: For the lipophilic assay, EO were dissolved in acetone (10 mg in 1 mL acetone).
7: The EO acetone dilutions were further dissolved 40 and 80 in the phosphate buffer for the experiments.
8: The measurements were performed in triplicate by a method described in Fredotovic et al.
9: [ 53].
10: The ORAC values of hydrosols are expressed as mol of Trolox equivalents (TE) per g of the total (undiluted) tested hydrosol sample.
11: The ORAC values of EOs were expressed as mol of Trolox equivalents (TE) per g of essential oil.
12: The results were obtained from three independent experiments.
