<p>Aromatic herbs are sensitive to drying processes, which can lead to the loss of biological activity [

 <italic>Z. zerumbet</italic> fresh or dried rhizome essential oils were studied; the results indicate that the zerumbone content in the fresh rhizome essential oil from different geographical locations varied from 8.1 to 84.8% [

 <italic>Z. zerumbet</italic> rhizome has not been reported. Hence, this study was designed to compare the chemical composition and antioxidant, antimicrobial, and cytotoxic activities of fresh and dry 
 <italic>Z. zerumbet</italic> rhizome essential oils. At the same time, the zerumbone, as a major bioactive constituent, was purified and compared with the bioactivities of volatile oils from fresh and dry rhizomes.
