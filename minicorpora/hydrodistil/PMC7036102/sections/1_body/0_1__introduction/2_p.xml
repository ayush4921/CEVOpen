 <italic>Z. zerumbet</italic> rhizome oil is used in perfumes and has been studied extensively because of its high medicinal value [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The chemical constituents of 
 <italic>Z. zerumbet</italic> rhizome essential oil from India, Malaysia, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Reunion Island, Fiji, Vietnam, Philippines, Thailand, Polynesia Islands, and Japan have been studied, and the results indicate that the chemical constituents of rhizome essential oil varied according to geographical location [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The 
 <italic>Z. zerumbet</italic> rhizome oil is a mixture of terpenes and contains zerumbone as the major constituent [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The zerumbone and 
 <italic>Z. zerumbet</italic> rhizome oil have been demonstrated to have a variety of pharmacological activities, including chemopreventive [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], chemotherapeutic [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], antiproliferative [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], antinociceptive [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], antimicrobial [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], antitumor [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], antihypersensitivity [

 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], antisecretory [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and anti-inflammatory [

 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] properties. To our knowledge, the chemical constituents and pharmacological activities of the 
 <italic>Z. zerumbet</italic> rhizome volatile oil from Southwest China have not been reported.
