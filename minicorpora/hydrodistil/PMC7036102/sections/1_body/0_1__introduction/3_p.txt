0: Aromatic herbs are sensitive to drying processes, which can lead to the loss of biological activity [ 34].
1: In the previous literature, the chemical constituents of  Z. zerumbet fresh or dried rhizome essential oils were studied; the results indicate that the zerumbone content in the fresh rhizome essential oil from different geographical locations varied from 8.1 to 84.8% [ 4,  9,  12 24] and the zerumbone content of the dry rhizome oil from different geographical locations varied between 1.2 and 35.5% [ 25 27].
2: To our knowledge, the effect of drying on the chemical constituents and pharmacological activities of the volatile oil of  Z. zerumbet rhizome has not been reported.
3: Hence, this study was designed to compare the chemical composition and antioxidant, antimicrobial, and cytotoxic activities of fresh and dry  Z. zerumbet rhizome essential oils.
4: At the same time, the zerumbone, as a major bioactive constituent, was purified and compared with the bioactivities of volatile oils from fresh and dry rhizomes.
