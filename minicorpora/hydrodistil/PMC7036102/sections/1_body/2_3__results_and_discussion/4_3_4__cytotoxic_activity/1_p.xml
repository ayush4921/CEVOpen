<p>The antiproliferation activity of fresh and dry rhizome oils and zerumbone was evaluated against K562, PC-3, and A549 human tumor cell lines and MRC-5 normal human cell line by MTT assay (
 <xref rid="tab5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). FR-EO, DR-EO, and zerumbone exhibited significant cytotoxicity against all tested tumor cell lines in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. The cytotoxic capacity against tumor cell lines of the oils and zerumbone were, from strongest to weakest: zerumbone &gt; FR-EO &gt; DR-EO, with statistical significance at 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05. The zerumbone reduced the proliferation of A549 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 11.09 ± 0.39 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL), PC-3 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 7.66 ± 0.68 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL), and K562 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 4.21 ± 0.84 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) cell lines after 72 h incubation and showed more cytotoxicity against K562 compared to the positive control (cisplatin). The FR-EO affected the proliferation of A549, PC-3, and K562 cell lines for 72 h incubation with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values (10.48–14.51 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) and was more effective than DR-EO, which had IC
 <sub>50</sub> values in the range 13.83 to 33.24 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL for 72 h incubation (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of FR-EO, DR-EO, and zerumbone against K562, PC-3, and A549 tumor cells were significantly lower compared to those against the normal cell line (MRC-5, IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 56.98–147.29 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL for 72 h), with statistical significance at 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05. Recent studies have shown that zerumbone possessed significant cytotoxic activity against lung cancer [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], colon cancer [
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], leukemia [
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], ovarian cancer [
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], skin cancer [
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], liver cancer [
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], and breast cancer [
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Zerumbone from 
 <italic>Z. zerumbet</italic> has been found to be a highly active anticancer natural product [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In previous studies, zerumbone had no considerable cytotoxic effect on normal mammalian cells (Vero) up to 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL after 48 h incubation [
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Zerumbone exhibited selective cytotoxic activity to human tumor cell lines, with a significantly lower cytotoxicity to human normal cell line than to tumor cells. The second main compound in both FR-EO and DR-EO was 
 <italic>α</italic>-humulene (10.8% and 28.5%, respectively). The 
 <italic>α</italic>-humulene, a structural analogue lacking only the carbonyl group in zerumbone, did not exhibit anticancer ability [
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Therefore, drying process negatively affected the cytotoxic capacity of rhizome essential oil suggesting that zerumbone, mostly lost during the process, was mainly responsible of cytotoxic activity.
