<p>The antioxidant ability of oils and zerumbone was determined based on DPPH and ABTS assays using ascorbic acid and BHT as positive control (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of DPPH free-radical-scavenging capacity were 17416.04 ± 3274.95, 32385.39 ± 5628.23, and 90293.12 ± 3529.38 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL for DR-EO, FR-EO, and zerumbone, respectively, which were much higher than those of BHT (29.25 ± 1.87 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) and ascorbic acid (1.57 ± 0.23 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL). In the determination of ABTS radical-scavenging capacity, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of DR-EO (2884.67 ± 232.71 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL), FR-EO (2926.68 ± 104.28 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL), and zerumbone (10840.13 ± 938.35 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) were much higher than those of BHT (7.47 ± 0.12 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) and ascorbic acid (2.16 ± 0.43 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL). In the DPPH and ABTS assays, the greater the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value, the weaker the ability to scavenge free radicals. Zerumbone exhibited significantly lower radical-scavenging activity than the fresh and dry rhizome essential oils (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The DR-EO showed more radical-scavenging activity but was nonsignificant (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05) compared to the FR-EO. The DR-EO, FR-EO, and zerumbone showed weak radical-scavenging capacity according to DPPH and ABTS assays. However, Hemn et al. [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] reported that zerumbone was an effective antioxidant that inhibits free-radical production in the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. The DPPH and ABTS assays can be used to assess the ability to scavenge free radicals but are not suitable for assessing lipid peroxidation inhibition efficiency [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Different methods of assessment of antioxidant capacity 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> may result in inconsistent results.
