<p>The antimicrobial ability of fresh and dry rhizome essential oils and zerumbone was qualitatively determined based on the disc agar diffusion assay and quantitatively assessed by the broth microdilution assay. The results are presented in 
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="tab4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. The fresh and dry rhizome essential oils and zerumbone showed varying degrees of antimicrobial potential. Zerumbone was the most effective, as compared with FR-EO and DR-EO, against all tested strains; the diameter of inhibition zones ranged from 9.48 to 15.72 mm and showed minimal MIC (31.25–250.00 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) and MBC (62.50–250.00 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL). The MIC and MBC values of FR-EO were the same as those of DR-EO against 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic>, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, and 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, but FR-EO exhibited higher activity than DR-EO against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, and 
 <italic>P. vulgaris</italic>, with the diameter of inhibition zones (9.36–14.54 mm), MIC (78.13–156.25 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL), and MBC (156.25–312.25 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL). The diameter of inhibition zones, MIC, and MBC for DR-EO against all tested strains ranged from 8.23 to 12.31 mm, 156.25 to 1250.00 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, and 156.25 to 2500.00 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, respectively. Zerumbone was reported to exhibit significant to moderate antimicrobial activity and was discovered to be an important antimicrobial active compound [

 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Hence, the antimicrobial capacity of 
 <italic>Z. zerumbet</italic> rhizome oil might be associated with the content of zerumbone. Oven drying significantly reduced the content of zerumbone, which might be responsible for the decrease in the antimicrobial ability of 
 <italic>Z. zerumbet</italic> rhizome essential oil.
