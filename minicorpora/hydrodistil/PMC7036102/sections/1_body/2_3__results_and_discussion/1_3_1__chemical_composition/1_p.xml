<p>Hydrodistillation of fresh and dry 
 <italic>Z. zerumbet</italic> rhizomes yielded essential oils in 0.65% and 0.39% (w/w) of fresh weight, respectively. In the present study, crystals were observed during hydrodistillation. Zerumbone crystals were uniformly mixed with rhizome oils and were analyzed by using GC-FID/MS (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Thirty-six compounds were identified, accounting for 98.9% of FR-EO. The major component was zerumbone (75.0%), followed by 
 <italic>α</italic>-humulene (6.5%), humulene oxide I (3.8%), camphene (3.3%), humulene oxide II (2.7%), camphor (1.3%), caryophyllene oxide (1.3%), and 1,8-cineole (1.2%) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Thirty-six compounds representing 98.8% of DR-EO were identified, containing mainly zerumbone (41.9%), followed by 
 <italic>α</italic>-humulene (29.4%), humulene oxide I (6.0%), humulene oxide II (3.9%), camphene (3.9%), 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene (2.5%), camphor (2.4%), caryophyllene oxide (2.1%), and 1,8-cineole (1.6%) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The chemical constituents of 
 <italic>Z. zerumbet</italic> rhizome oil from different geographic regions were found to vary [

 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–

 <italic>Z. zerumbet</italic> rhizome volatile oil from Southwest China have not been reported. Most early studies showed that zerumbone was the main constituent. The zerumbone content in FR-EO from different geographical locations varied from 8.1 to 84.8% [

 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In DR-EO from different geographical locations, the zerumbone content varied between 1.2 and 35.5% [

 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Our work was undertaken to compare chemical constituents of essential oils of fresh and dry 
 <italic>Z. zerumbet</italic> rhizomes from a single geographical location. The results showed that the content of zerumbone was higher in fresh rhizome oil than in dry rhizome oil. The loss of zerumbone during oven drying processing steps of the rhizome might be attributed to its high volatility. The FR-EO yield (0.65%) of 
 <italic>Z. zerumbet</italic> was higher than the DR-EO yield (0.39%). Oven drying significantly decreased the content of zerumbone and resulted in a low extraction yield of DR-EO. Zerumbone was isolated from fresh rhizome essential oil by recrystallization and identified by spectroscopic analysis. HPLC was used to verify the purity of zerumbone (purity &gt; 99.0%). This method of extracting zerumbone from fresh rhizome essential oil using only recrystallization is a relatively simple and effective method.
