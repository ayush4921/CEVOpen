0: Zerumbone was isolated from the essential oil of fresh rhizomes using the recrystallization method.
1: Fresh rhizome essential oil (5 g) was dissolved in hexane (10 mL) and crystallized in a refrigerator at 20C for 30 min and then filtered.
2: Recrystallization in hexane at 20C for 30 min and then filtration gave a white crystalline compound.
3: High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to confirm the purity of the isolated compound (purity > 99.0%).
4: The white crystals were identified as zerumbone based on a range of detection methods (EI-MS,  1H NMR, and  13C NMR).
5: EI-MS  m/z (%): 218 [M+], 203, 189, 175, 163, 150, 135 (100), 121, 107, 96, 79, 67, 53, 41.
6: 1H NMR (CDCl 3, 400 MHz),  : 0.99 (3H, s, H-15), 1.13 (3H, s, H-14), 1.46 (3H, s, H-12), 1.72 (3H, s, H-13), 1.751.88 (1H, m, H-1), 2.122.30 (4H, m, H-1, H-4, H-5), 2.302.43 (1H, m, H-5), 5.18 (1H, bd,  J = 15.1 Hz, H-2), 5.78 (1H, d,  J = 16.4 Hz, H-10), 5.89 (1H, d,  J = 16.4 Hz, H-9), 5.925.96 (1H, m, H-6);  13C NMR (CDCl 3, 100 MHz),  : 11.8 (C-13), 15.3 (C-12), 24.3(C-15), 24.5 (C-5), 29.5 (C-14), 37.9 (C-11), 39.5 (C-4), 42.4 (C-1), 125.0 (C-2), 127.2 (C-9), 136.3 (C-3), 137.9 (C-7), 148.9 (C-6), 160.7 (C-10), 204.3 (C-8).
7: The white crystals were identified as zerumbone by comparison with the reported spectral data [ 4,  35].
