<p>Zerumbone was isolated from the essential oil of fresh rhizomes using the recrystallization method. Fresh rhizome essential oil (5 g) was dissolved in hexane (10 mL) and crystallized in a refrigerator at −20°C for 30 min and then filtered. Recrystallization in hexane at −20°C for 30 min and then filtration gave a white crystalline compound. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to confirm the purity of the isolated compound (purity &gt; 99.0%). The white crystals were identified as zerumbone based on a range of detection methods (EI-MS, 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR, and 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR). EI-MS
