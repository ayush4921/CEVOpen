0: Human prostatic carcinoma (PC-3), leukemic (K562), lung cancer (A549), and fetal lung fibroblasts (MRC-5) cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (2 mM glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 U/mL streptomycin) and incubated in a humidified incubator at 37C with 5% CO 2 atmosphere.
1: The cytotoxic activity was evaluated by MTT assay with slight modification [ 41].
2: The cells were seeded at a density of 5  10 3 cells per well in 80  L of culture medium and incubated for 24 h before treatment.
3: The FR-EO, DR-EO, and zerumbone were dissolved in DMSO and then serially double diluted with the medium.
4: The diluted sample solution (20  L) was added to each well and incubated for 24, 48, and 72 h. The medium was then removed, and 10  L of MTT solution (5 mg/mL in PBS) was added to the wells and cultured for 4 h. Formazan crystals in each well were dissolved by the addition of DMSO (150  L).
5: A microplate spectrophotometer was used to measure and record the optical density at 490 nm.
6: The results of cytotoxic activity were expressed using the IC 50 value.
7: Each test was repeated in triplicate.
