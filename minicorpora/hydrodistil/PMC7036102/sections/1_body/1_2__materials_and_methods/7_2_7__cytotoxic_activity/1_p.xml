<p>Human prostatic carcinoma (PC-3), leukemic (K562), lung cancer (A549), and fetal lung fibroblasts (MRC-5) cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (2 mM glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 U/mL streptomycin) and incubated in a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere. The cytotoxic activity was evaluated by MTT assay with slight modification [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> cells per well in 80 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of culture medium and incubated for 24 h before treatment. The FR-EO, DR-EO, and zerumbone were dissolved in DMSO and then serially double diluted with the medium. The diluted sample solution (20 
 <italic>μ</italic>L) was added to each well and incubated for 24, 48, and 72 h. The medium was then removed, and 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of MTT solution (5 mg/mL in PBS) was added to the wells and cultured for 4 h. Formazan crystals in each well were dissolved by the addition of DMSO (150 
 <italic>μ</italic>L). A microplate spectrophotometer was used to measure and record the optical density at 490 nm. The results of cytotoxic activity were expressed using the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value. Each test was repeated in triplicate.
