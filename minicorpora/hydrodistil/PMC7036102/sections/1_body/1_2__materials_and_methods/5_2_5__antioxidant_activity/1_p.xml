<p>The 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free-radical-scavenging capacity of fresh and dry rhizome oils and zerumbone was determined according to the method reported previously [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] with minor modification. Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and ascorbic acid were used as positive controls. Various concentrations of oils and zerumbone solution (1 mL) were mixed with DPPH methanol solution (0.1 mM, 1 mL) and allowed to stand at 37°C for 30 min. The absorbance of the samples was measured with a spectrophotometer at 517 nm.
