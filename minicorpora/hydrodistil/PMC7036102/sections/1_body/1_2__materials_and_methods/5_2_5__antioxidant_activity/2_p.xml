<p>The 2,2′-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) radical-scavenging capacity of oils and zerumbone was determined according to the method reported by Re et al. [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] with marginal modifications. ABTS solution was generated by reacting 7 mM ABTS solution with 2.45 mM K
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>8</sub>; the mixture was then allowed to stand at 37°C for 16 h. Before experiments, ABTS was diluted with methanol to obtain an ABTS solution with an absorbance of 0.70 ± 0.02 at 734 nm. The ABTS solution (4 mL) was added to various concentrations of sample solution (0.4 mL), and then, the mixture was incubated at 37°C for 10 min in the dark. The results are expressed using the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value and ascorbic acid equivalent antioxidant capacity (AEAC) value. All measurements were repeated three times.
