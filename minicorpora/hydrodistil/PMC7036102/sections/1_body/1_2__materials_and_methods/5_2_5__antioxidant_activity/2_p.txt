0: The 2,2-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) radical-scavenging capacity of oils and zerumbone was determined according to the method reported by Re et al.
1: [ 37] with marginal modifications.
2: ABTS solution was generated by reacting 7 mM ABTS solution with 2.45 mM K 2S 2O 8; the mixture was then allowed to stand at 37C for 16 h. Before experiments, ABTS was diluted with methanol to obtain an ABTS solution with an absorbance of 0.70  0.02 at 734 nm.
3: The ABTS solution (4 mL) was added to various concentrations of sample solution (0.4 mL), and then, the mixture was incubated at 37C for 10 min in the dark.
4: The results are expressed using the IC 50 value and ascorbic acid equivalent antioxidant capacity (AEAC) value.
5: All measurements were repeated three times.
