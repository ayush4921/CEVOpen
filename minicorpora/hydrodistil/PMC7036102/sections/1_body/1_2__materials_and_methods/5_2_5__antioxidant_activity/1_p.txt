0: The 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free-radical-scavenging capacity of fresh and dry rhizome oils and zerumbone was determined according to the method reported previously [ 36] with minor modification.
1: Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and ascorbic acid were used as positive controls.
2: Various concentrations of oils and zerumbone solution (1 mL) were mixed with DPPH methanol solution (0.1 mM, 1 mL) and allowed to stand at 37C for 30 min.
3: The absorbance of the samples was measured with a spectrophotometer at 517 nm.
