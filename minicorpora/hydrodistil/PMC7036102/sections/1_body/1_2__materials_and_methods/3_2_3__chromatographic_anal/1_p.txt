0: The GC-FID analysis was carried out with an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph (GC) system coupled to a flame-ionization detector (FID) and equipped with a HP-5MS capillary column (60 m  0.25 mm  0.25  m film thickness).
1: The injection volume was 1  L (split ratio at 1 : 100) with helium as the carrier gas (flow rate: 1 mL/min).
2: Oven temperature was as follows: 46C (2 min), 3C/min to 190C (48 min), and 15C/min to 310C (8 min).
3: The GC-MS analysis was carried out with an Agilent 6890 GC system fitted with an Agilent 5975C MS and a HP-5MS fused silica column.
4: GC parameters were as described above.
5: MS was set to EI mode of 70 eV with mass range ( m/ z 29 to 500).
6: The percentage of chemical component was calculated by the peak area normalization method.
7: The experimental retention index was calculated by injecting a series of  n-alkanes (C 9C 18).
8: The constituents of essential oils were identified by comparison with retention index and mass spectral data in the NIST 14 and Wiley 275 databases.
