<p>The GC-FID analysis was carried out with an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph (GC) system coupled to a flame-ionization detector (FID) and equipped with a HP-5MS capillary column (60 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 
 <italic>μ</italic>m film thickness). The injection volume was 1 
 <italic>μ</italic>L (split ratio at 1 : 100) with helium as the carrier gas (flow rate: 1 mL/min). Oven temperature was as follows: 46°C (2 min), 3°C/min to 190°C (48 min), and 15°C/min to 310°C (8 min). The GC-MS analysis was carried out with an Agilent 6890 GC system fitted with an Agilent 5975C MS and a HP-5MS fused silica column. GC parameters were as described above. MS was set to EI mode of 70 eV with mass range (
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 29 to 500). The percentage of chemical component was calculated by the peak area normalization method. The experimental retention index was calculated by injecting a series of 
 <italic>n</italic>-alkanes (C
 <sub>9</sub>–C
 <sub>18</sub>). The constituents of essential oils were identified by comparison with retention index and mass spectral data in the NIST 14 and Wiley 275 databases.
