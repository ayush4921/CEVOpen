0: Antimicrobial tests were performed with seven microbial strains of  Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6538P),  Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212),  Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CMCC (B) 10104),  Bacillus subtilis (CMCC (B) 63501),  Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922),  Proteus vulgaris (CMCC (B) 49027), and  Candida albicans (CMCC (F) 98001).
1: Antimicrobial activities of FR-EO, DR-EO, and zerumbone were evaluated by using the disc agar diffusion assay reported previously [ 38] with minor modification.
2: FR-EO, DR-EO, and zerumbone solutions were diluted with ethyl acetate (100 mg/mL).
3: Filter paper discs (diameter 6 mm) containing oils and zerumbone solution (20  L) were incubated at 37C for 24 h, and the inhibition zone diameter (including the 6 mm disk) was recorded.
4: The MIC and MBC values of FR-EO, DR-EO, and zerumbone were evaluated by the broth microdilution assay described previously [ 39] with slight modification.
5: The FR-EO, DR-EO, and zerumbone were initially diluted in DMSO and later in MuellerHinton broth or Sabouraud dextrose broth.
6: The tested sample solution of twofold dilution (100  L) was transferred into each well.
7: The inoculum was added to all wells.
8: The final concentration of the bacterial cells in the wells was approximately 5  10 5 CFU/mL.
9: The 96-well plates were incubated for 24 h at 37C, and then, 10  L of resazurin aqueous solution (0.01%) was added to the 96-well plates as an indicator of microbial growth by detecting the reduction of blue dye resazurin to pink resorufin.
10: The 96-well plates were incubated at 37C for 2 h in the dark.
11: The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of the sample when the resazurin color changed.
12: To obtain the MBC value, 10  L samples were obtained from the wells (no color change) and subcultured in agar plates, and the MBC was determined as the lowest concentration without any microbial growth after 24 h at 37C [ 40].
13: Each test was repeated in triplicate.
