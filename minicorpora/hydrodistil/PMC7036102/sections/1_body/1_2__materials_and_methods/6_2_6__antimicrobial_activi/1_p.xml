<p>Antimicrobial tests were performed with seven microbial strains of 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (ATCC 6538P), 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> (ATCC 29212), 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (CMCC (B) 10104), 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (CMCC (B) 63501), 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (ATCC 25922), 
 <italic>Proteus vulgaris</italic> (CMCC (B) 49027), and 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> (CMCC (F) 98001). Antimicrobial activities of FR-EO, DR-EO, and zerumbone were evaluated by using the disc agar diffusion assay reported previously [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] with minor modification. FR-EO, DR-EO, and zerumbone solutions were diluted with ethyl acetate (100 mg/mL). Filter paper discs (diameter 6 mm) containing oils and zerumbone solution (20 
 <italic>μ</italic>L) were incubated at 37°C for 24 h, and the inhibition zone diameter (including the 6 mm disk) was recorded. The MIC and MBC values of FR-EO, DR-EO, and zerumbone were evaluated by the broth microdilution assay described previously [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] with slight modification. The FR-EO, DR-EO, and zerumbone were initially diluted in DMSO and later in Mueller–Hinton broth or Sabouraud dextrose broth. The tested sample solution of twofold dilution (100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L) was transferred into each well. The inoculum was added to all wells. The final concentration of the bacterial cells in the wells was approximately 5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> CFU/mL. The 96-well plates were incubated for 24 h at 37°C, and then, 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of resazurin aqueous solution (0.01%) was added to the 96-well plates as an indicator of microbial growth by detecting the reduction of blue dye resazurin to pink resorufin. The 96-well plates were incubated at 37°C for 2 h in the dark. The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of the sample when the resazurin color changed. To obtain the MBC value, 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>L samples were obtained from the wells (no color change) and subcultured in agar plates, and the MBC was determined as the lowest concentration without any microbial growth after 24 h at 37°C [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Each test was repeated in triplicate.
