<p>To our knowledge, this is the first comparison of the chemical composition and antioxidant, antimicrobial, and cytotoxic activities of 
 <italic>Z. zerumbet</italic> fresh and dry rhizome essential oils. Thirty-six compounds of FR-EO and DR-EO were identified by using GC-FID/MS, and the major component was zerumbone (75.0% and 41.9%, respectively). In addition to their low antioxidant activity, FR-EO, DR-EO, and zerumbone demonstrated significant antimicrobial capacity against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, and 
 <italic>P. vulgaris</italic> and significant cytotoxic activity against A549, K562, and PC-3 cell lines. Oven drying had a significant effect on the chemical constituents and on the antimicrobial and cytotoxic capacity of the rhizome oil. From GC-MS data, it was clear that the content of zerumbone in DR-EO was considerably less than that in FR-EO. The results of antimicrobial and cytotoxic analysis clearly showed that FR-EO was more effective than DR-EO. Oven drying significantly reduced the content of zerumbone, which was responsible for the decline in antibacterial and cytotoxic properties of rhizome. The fresh 
 <italic>Z. zerumbet</italic> rhizome was found to have more bioactive compound, zerumbone, and showed stronger antimicrobial and cytotoxic properties than the dry rhizome. Thus, fresh 
 <italic>Z. zerumbet</italic> rhizomes should be preferred in cosmetics, food, and pharmaceutical applications.
