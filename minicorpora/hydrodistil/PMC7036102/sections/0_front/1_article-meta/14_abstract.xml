 <p>The chemical constituents and the antioxidant, antimicrobial, and cytotoxic activities of fresh rhizome essential oil (FR-EO) and dry rhizome essential oil (DR-EO) of 
  <italic>Zingiber zerumbet</italic> (L.) Smith obtained from Southwest China were compared. Zerumbone was the predominant component in both FR-EO and DR-EO (75.0% and 41.9%, respectively). FR-EO, DR-EO, and zerumbone were all demonstrated to have significant antimicrobial capacity against 
  <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
  <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, 
  <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, and 
  <italic>Proteus vulgaris</italic>, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ranging from 31.25 to 156.25 
  <italic>μ</italic>g/mL and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) ranging from 62.50 to 625.00 
  <italic>μ</italic>g/mL. Zerumbone showed the strongest antimicrobial potential against all tested microorganisms compared with the fresh and dry rhizome essential oils. FR-EO was found to be more active than DR-EO against 
  <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
  <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, 
  <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, and 
  <italic>Proteus vulgaris</italic>. FR-EO, DR-EO, and zerumbone all showed significant cytotoxic activity against K562, PC-3, and A549 human tumor cell lines in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Zerumbone exhibited the strongest antiproliferative activity against all tested human tumor cell lines with an IC
  <sub>50</sub> of 4.21–11.09 
  <italic>μ</italic>g/mL for 72 h incubation, as compared with the fresh and dry rhizome oils. The cytotoxic activity of FR-EO (IC
  <sub>50</sub>: 10.48–14.51 
  <italic>μ</italic>g/mL for 72 h) was found to be significantly higher (
  <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) than that of DR-EO (IC
  <sub>50</sub>: 13.83–33.24 
  <italic>μ</italic>g/mL for 72 h). FR-EO, DR-EO, and zerumbone exhibited selective cytotoxic activity to tumor cells, with a significantly low cytotoxicity to normal cells (MRC-5, IC
  <sub>50</sub>: 56.98–147.29 
  <italic>μ</italic>g/mL). However, FR-EO, DR-EO, and zerumbone all exhibited weak free-radical-scavenging activity according to DPPH and ABTS analysis. The findings highlighted in this study show that FR-EO provides appreciably higher content of the bioactive compound, zerumbone, and has higher antimicrobial and cytotoxic properties than DR-EO. Thus, fresh 
  <italic>Z. zerumbet</italic> rhizome should be preferred in cosmetic, food, and pharmaceutical applications.
