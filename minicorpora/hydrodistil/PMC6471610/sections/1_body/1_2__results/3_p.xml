<p>Analyzing the influence of ethanol concentrations on the extraction of compounds, it was found that most of the different compounds were extracted using 70% ethanol (fifteen compounds), or at least 50% ethanol (eight compounds). The higher the ethanol concentration, the better the extracts were extracted, for example with

 <xref rid="molecules-24-01062-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In contrast, when weaker ethanol concentrations were used more isolemicin was extracted (62.24%, 23.63%). In the extract of 96% ethanol isolemicin was not found.
