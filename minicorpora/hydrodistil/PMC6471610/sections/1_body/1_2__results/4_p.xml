<p>The data of the extracts with magnesium aluminometasilicate, using 70% ethanol as a solvent (UAE4, UAE5, UAE6, 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01062-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) showed that when 1% magnesium aluminometasilicate was used, the utmost quantity of compounds was identified (90.92%). Magnesium aluminometasilicate helped extract sabinene (from 29.9 to 32.69%, in extracts without magnesium aluminometasilicate sabinene was not found). The following compounds were also detected in extracts with magnesium aluminometasilicate exposure: myrcene, isoterpinolene, isogermacrene, limonene,
