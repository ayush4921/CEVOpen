<p>The composition of the essential oils, which were obtained using hydrodistillation (HD1) and hydrodistillation with excipients from HD2 to HD4 (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01062-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), showed that 1% of magnesium aluminometasilicate significantly improved amount of 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene and sabinene compared to conventional hydrodistillation, respectively 54.95% and 106.32%. Using 0.5% and 2% of magnesium aluminometasilicate the amount of the 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene and sabinene was higher than HD1 but lower than HD3 (
