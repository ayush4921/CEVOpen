<p>Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis was performed on a GCMS-QP2010 system (Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan). Twenty microliters of sample (extract or essential oil) was diluted to 1 mL with hexane (≥99%, Sigma–Aldrich, Germany). The column used was a 30 m × 0.25 mm i.d. × 0.25 µL film thickness RTX-5MS column. Flow rate of helium (99.999%, AGA Lithuania) carrier gas was set at 1.23 mL/min. The oven temperature was maintained at 40 °C for 2 min after injection and then programmed at 3 °C/min to 210 °C, at which the column was maintained for 10 min. The split ratio was 1:10. The mass detector electron ionization was 70 eV. Identification of volatile compounds was carried out using mass spectra library search (NIST 14) and compared with the mass spectral data from literature [
