0: Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis was performed on a GCMS-QP2010 system (Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan).
1: Twenty microliters of sample (extract or essential oil) was diluted to 1 mL with hexane (99%, SigmaAldrich, Germany).
2: The column used was a 30 m  0.25 mm i.d.
3: 0.25 L film thickness RTX-5MS column.
4: Flow rate of helium (99.999%, AGA Lithuania) carrier gas was set at 1.23 mL/min.
5: The oven temperature was maintained at 40 C for 2 min after injection and then programmed at 3 C/min to 210 C, at which the column was maintained for 10 min.
6: The split ratio was 1:10.
7: The mass detector electron ionization was 70 eV.
8: Identification of volatile compounds was carried out using mass spectra library search (NIST 14) and compared with the mass spectral data from literature [ 45].
