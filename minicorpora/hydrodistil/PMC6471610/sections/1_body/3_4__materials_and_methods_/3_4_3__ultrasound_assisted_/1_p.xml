We used different concentrations of ethanol for extraction (96%, 70%, and 50%). The flask with substance was put in an ultrasound bath (Sonorex Digitec DT 156 BH, Germany). Extracts were prepared on 25 °C temperature for 30 min. After that, the extracts were filtered with paper filter and stored in a refrigerator at 4 °C until further analysis.</p>
