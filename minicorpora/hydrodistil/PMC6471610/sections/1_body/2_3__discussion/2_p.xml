<p>In our study, when 96% ethanol was used (ultrasound extraction, sample UAE3), the α-pinene content was obtained at 14.67%, in other study using the same method, 6.75 ± 0.92% was obtained [

 <italic>cis</italic>-p-menth-2-en-1-ol was obtained at about 0.1% [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-24-01062" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, in our study using 96% ethanol the compound was obtained at 3.25%, which is 32.5 times more than in the previously mentioned study, and if we compare this with extraction using 70% ethanol, the yield of 
 <italic>cis</italic>-p-menth-2-en-1-ol was obtained at 58.8 (5.88%) times more in our research (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01062-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Using nutmeg seeds material from Grenada we did not find any isoelemicin (ultrasound extraction, 96% ethanol), the other researchers found 0.8 ± 0.46% [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-24-01062" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], but we used 50% and 70% ethanol and determined the quantity of isoelemicin, which was 62.24% and 23.63%, respectively. The excipients are used to improve the extraction of the active compounds. Surfactants used in experiments improve the extraction of certain compounds, such as Sodium dodecyle sulfate (SDS), Triton X 100, PEG 2000, Brij 35, Tween, etc. [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-24-01062" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In our study we used magnesium aluminometasilicate as excipient, and our purpose was to research and determine the effect of magnesium aluminometasilicate on the extraction of active compounds. Previously, this substance has not been used in studies with extracts and essential oils. Magnesium aluminometasilicate is used as excipient in solid drug form formulations [

 <xref rid="B33-molecules-24-01062" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Using this material, we have relied on its mechanism of action. It adsorbs high loads of oil [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-24-01062" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], so we predicted that it could extract more essential oil components. The results of GC-MS analysis showed the influence of the excipients on gaining different quantities of certain compounds. Magnesium aluminometasilicate significantly improved the amount of sabinene. If we compare it to the essential oils that were made by using simple hydrodistillation (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01062-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), we see that 0.5% and 2% of magnesium aluminometasilicate increased sabinene by 7.41 ± 0.2 times (49.6% and 47.1%, traditional hydrodistillation—6.53%), the 1% of magnesium aluminometasilicate increased sabinene by 9.41 times (61.42%). These results are significant. Dupuy [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-24-01062" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] reported 6.00–36.08% quantity of sabinene, and the nutmeg seeds were from Indonesia. Also, magnesium aluminometasilicate had influence on limonene (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01062-f001">Figure 1</xref>) and 
 <italic>γ</italic>-terpinene extraction. The other samples made without the excipient did not have these compounds (M1, HD1, UAE1-UAE3) (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01062-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Sabinene has anti-inflammatory, antifungal, and antioxidant effects [

 <xref rid="B36-molecules-24-01062" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], limonene has low-toxicity and anticancer effect [

 <italic>γ</italic>-terpinene characterizes as an antimicrobial and antioxidant agent [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-24-01062" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Magnesium aluminometasilicate’s influence on 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene and 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene was different. The 1% of magnesium aluminometasilicate increased the quantity of 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene by 45% (from 8.27% to 15.05%) and decreased 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene by 84% (from 26.61% to 4.32%). Piaru [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-24-01062" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] results showed that 
 <italic>Myristica fragrans</italic> seeds’s essential oil from Malaysia contained 8.5% 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene and 3.5% 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene.
