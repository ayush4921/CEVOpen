<p>Our experimental data showed that the essential oil yield increased if we used magnesium aluminometasilicate as excipient which facilitated volatile compounds extraction. Essential oil yield from 
 <italic>Myristica fragrans</italic> was 5.25 ± 0.04%; however, the magnesium aluminometasilicate was used for the yield of the essential oil and it was from 7.9 ± 0.09% to 10.43 ± 0.09%. Using sea water, the yield of oil-bearing rose increased statistically insignificantly by 0.045%, but the sea water significantly decreases the citronellol rate from 41.49% to 33.56%, and significantly increases geraniol (from 17.58% to 27.44%) [

All essential oil samples with magnesium aluminometasilicate have 21 chemical compounds, although essential oil made by simple hydrodistillation has 24 compounds but that is not significantly important. The yield of nutmeg essential oil significantly increases with magnesium aluminometasilicate as excipient. The essential oil yield from nutmeg seeds (Nigeria) was 1.46% [

 <xref rid="B44-molecules-24-01062" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Nutmeg seeds from Indonesia were hydrodistillated and the yield of essential oil was obtained at 5.84%.
