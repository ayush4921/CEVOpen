<p>In this study, the extracts, essential oil, and the influence of excipient were analyzed. The composition of the aqueous (M1) and ethanolic (UAE1–UAE6) extracts and essential oil (HD1–HD4) of nutmeg were determined (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01062-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Our results show that the extract which was obtained using maceration with water had 10 different chemical compounds of which the most commonly found are myrislignan (22.59%), elemicin (13.99%), and α-phellandrene (13.04%). We did not find any research done with aqueous extract of nutmeg. In ethanolic extract, which was made by using maceration, the quantity of elemicin (5.7%) was 2.45 times lower, and the quantity of α-phellandrene was 21.73 times higher [

 <xref rid="B30-molecules-24-01062" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], so using maceration with water is more effective if a bigger effect is needed. Myrislignan has anti-inflammatory [

 <xref rid="B32-molecules-24-01062" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] effects. This compound was not extracted using ethanol [
