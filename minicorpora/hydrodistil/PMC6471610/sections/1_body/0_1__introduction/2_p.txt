0: Traditional methods such as maceration, percolation, infusion, decoction, and Soxhlet method are commonly used to produce extracts [ 8, 13].
1: These methods are cheap but less efficient, which wastes a lot of time and raw materials [ 14].
2: One of the more recent methods for extracts is extraction in an ultrasound-assisted bath, it is an effective method, in which it is possible to choose the desired conditions (i.e., temperature, duration), and it saves on materials and time [ 2, 15].
3: Ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) has many modifications with solvents, and extra material can be used for extraction; for example: surfactants [ 16], polysaccharides [ 17], salts [ 18], acids [ 19], and other excipients, which can increase the efficiency of extraction.
