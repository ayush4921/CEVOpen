 <xref rid="B20-molecules-24-01062" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In different sources, hydrodistillation is carried out for various times and solid:solvent ratios. Hydrodistillation is carried out using water, and few studies have been carried out using extra material for extraction such as sea water [
