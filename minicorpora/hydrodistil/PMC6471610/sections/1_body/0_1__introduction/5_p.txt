0: Excipients are used for improving extraction and changing environmental conditions.
1: For example, salts that change ion voltage, surfactants, emulsifiers (sorbitan esters (Spans ), polysorbates (Tweens )), and pH-adjusting substances are used [ 9, 24, 25].
2: The magnesium aluminometasilicate will be used for the first time as an excipient for chemical compound extractions, previously it was used as an excipient only in solid dosage forms [ 26, 27].
3: It is a white amorphous powder with high surface area, practically insoluble in water.
4: The magnesium aluminometasilicate has the ability to absorb materials, which is characterized by water absorption capacity [ 26, 28].
