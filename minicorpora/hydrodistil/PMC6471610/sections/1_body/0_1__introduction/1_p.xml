<p>Since ancient times, nutmeg (
 <italic>Myristica fragrans</italic>, f. Myristicaceae) has been used as a spice. Its aphrodisiac effect is often mentioned [

 <xref rid="B2-molecules-24-01062" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. A lot of research is being done in order to test the pharmacological effects of nutmeg. Scientific sources say that nutmeg has antibacterial, insecticidal, antioxidant, anticancer, antidepressant, hepatoprotective, and many other effects [

The most common studies about essential oils are of nutmeg, which is rich in terpenes, phenols, various organic acids, and other compounds. Using different solvents, methods, and conditions, the composition of extracts and essential oils variations were studied [

 <italic>Myristica fragrans</italic> essential oil has predominantly monoterpene hydrocarbons (α-thujene, β-pinene, sabinene), sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (
 <sc>d</sc>-germacrene, trans-β-bergamotene), monoterpene alcohols (linalool, α-terpineol, 
 <italic>cis</italic>-p-menth-2-en-1-ol, terpinen-4-ol), esters (α-terpinyl acetate, 
 <italic>cis</italic>-sabinene hydrate acetate, citronellyl acetate), aromatics (eugenol, myristicin, elemicin, methoxyeugenol), and other compounds [
