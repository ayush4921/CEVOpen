<p>Extracts and essential oils from 
 <italic>Myristica fragrans</italic> seeds (Grenada) were prepared using three different methods (M, UAE, HD). The volatile compounds were analyzed by GC-MS. The results showed the samples’ quality and quantity of the chemical compounds composition. During the experiment magnesium aluminometasilicate was used for extraction in the hydrodistillation process. Previously, this excipient was used for the production of solid dosage forms. Ten chemical compounds were obtained using maceration, from eight to thirteen compounds were obtained using ultrasound-assisted extraction with different ethanol concentrations and without excipient, using UAE with magnesium aluminometasilicate, 16–19 compounds were obtained. Hydrodistillation with magnesium aluminometasilicate lead to 21 compounds, and finally, 24 compounds were obtained without the use of excipient. Although using hydrodistillation with the excipient fewer chemical compounds were obtained, some of the compounds’ quantities were bigger than using hydrodistillation without excipient. Magnesium aluminometasilicate as excipient improved the extraction of 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene, limonene, isoterpinolene, and sabinene, although it reduced the quantity of 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene. For the first time, eight chemical compounds in nutmeg essential oil were identified. Two of these compounds (
 <italic>γ</italic>-amorphene and cis-
 <italic>α</italic>-bergamotene) were obtained by the use of magnesium aluminometasilicate.
