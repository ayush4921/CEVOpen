<p>In this study the chemical profiles of the volatile fractions isolated from air-dried leaves of 
 <italic>E. camaldulensis</italic> Dehnh. collected in Iraqi Kurdistan, were investigated for the first time. Essential oils EO
 <sub>S</sub> and EO
 <sub>W</sub>, respectively, were obtained by hydrodistillation with circulating water and with non-circulating-water, respectively. They were compared with an oil (EO
 <sub>D</sub>) obtained by CO
 <sub>2</sub> extraction. The first two methods were much more efficient in terms of oil yield and number of oil components. A total of 31 and 42 components have been identified and quantified in EO
 <sub>S</sub> and EO
 <sub>W</sub>, respectively, by GC-FID and GC-MS, and comparison with literature databases. They accounted for more than 98% of the contents of the two oils. In both EO
 <sub>S</sub> and EO
 <sub>W</sub>, monoterpenoids prevailed over sesquiterpenoids, and oxygenated monoterpenes were more abundant than monoterpene hydrocarbons. The major components of EO
 <sub>S</sub> and EO
 <sub>W</sub>, accounting for more than 80%, were 1,8-cineole (
 <bold>1</bold>, about 60%), followed by 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (
 <bold>2</bold>), α-pinene (
 <bold>3</bold>), terpinen-4-ol (
 <bold>4</bold>), aromadendrene (
 <bold>5</bold>), and α-terpineol (
 <bold>6</bold>).
