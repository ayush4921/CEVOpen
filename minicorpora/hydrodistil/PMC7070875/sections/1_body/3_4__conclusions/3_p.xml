<p>We are all well-aware that the chemical composition of vapors inhaled from a leaf hot tea can be different from that of a volatile fraction isolated by hydrodistillation, such as EO
 <sub>S</sub>, and should be analyzed by techniques such as solid phase microextraction (SPME)-GC-MS. However, it appears plausible that most of the bioactive components of the EOs also occur in the vapors, although the relative percentages can be different. Thus, based on our findings, we believe that inhalation of vapors from a hot aqueous infusion of 
 <italic>E. camaldulensis</italic> leaves for treating the symptoms of respiratory tract diseases, is sustained by scientific evidence.
