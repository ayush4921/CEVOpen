0: For these reasons, it was worthy to study the components of volatile fractions isolated from  E. camaldulensis leaves collected in IraqiKurdistan using various isolation techniques.
1: Furthermore, the physiological effects of volatile fractions on respiratory physiology were investigated in detail with the aim of sustaining the traditional use of this antispasmodic remedy with scientific evidence.
2: To this purpose, the relaxant effects of different volatile fractions on the contractility of isolated rat aortic and tracheal rings have been determined.
3: Moreover, in order to shed light on the mechanism of action, the involvement of the Ca 2+ and K + channels, and the nitric oxide (NO) pathway in the biochemical processes underpinning the spasmolytic activity of the plant, was tested in vitro.
