<p>For these reasons, it was worthy to study the components of volatile fractions isolated from 
 <italic>E. camaldulensis</italic> leaves collected in Iraqiâ€“Kurdistan using various isolation techniques. Furthermore, the physiological effects of volatile fractions on respiratory physiology were investigated in detail with the aim of sustaining the traditional use of this antispasmodic remedy with scientific evidence. To this purpose, the relaxant effects of different volatile fractions on the contractility of isolated rat aortic and tracheal rings have been determined. Moreover, in order to shed light on the mechanism of action, the involvement of the Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> and K
 <sup>+</sup> channels, and the nitric oxide (NO) pathway in the biochemical processes underpinning the spasmolytic activity of the plant, was tested in vitro.
