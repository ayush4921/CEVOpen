<p>The Kurdistan region of Iraq has a rich biodiversity and many medicinal herbs, including 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> species, are used by local people in traditional medicine since time immemorial [

 <italic>Eucalyptus camaldulensis</italic> Dehnh. (family Myrtaceae), also known as river red gum or Murrey red gum tree [

The empirical knowledge of this traditional medicine is passed on by oral tradition. No scientific rationale has been reported so far and the mechanism of action remains largely uninvestigated.
