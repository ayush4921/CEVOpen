<p>Adult male albino rats, weighting 200–300 g each, were used for all experiments. They were kept in plastic cages at 24 °C and were exposed to a photoperiod cycle of 12 h light followed by 12 h darkness. Rats were fed standard diet and tap water. Access to water was free, while food was removed 24 h prior to experiments. Rats were injected intraperitoneally with heparin (1500 units/Kg body weight), then left for 30 min to avoid blood clotting and possible damage of the aorta endothelium, and finally anaesthetized with racemic ketamine (40 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) intraperitoneally. Chest cavity was opened, and excess tissues and fat were removed. Aorta was isolated and transferred to a beaker containing a Krebs solution aerated with 95% O
 <sub>2</sub> and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>, that was placed in a water-bath at 37 °C. Subsequently, the aorta was segmented into rings 3–5 mm long. Isolated thoracic aortic rings were used in preparations with intact endothelium. Aortic rings were mounted between two stainless steel hooks, connected by a thread to a force transducer coupled to a transbridge amplifier and a Power Lab Data Acquisition system (model ML 870, Power Lab, AD Instrument, Sydney, Australia), which was connected to a computer running chart software (Version 7). The isometric force produced was monitored and recorded. Experiments were performed in 10 mL organ baths filled with a physiological Krebs solution (pH = 7.4) maintained at 37 °C by means of a thermoregulating system with water continuously circulating throughout a double-walled water-jacketed system, and continuously gassed with 95% O
 <sub>2</sub> and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Tension was set at 2 g for 60 min, and the buffer solution was changed every 15 min until the resting tone became constant. After these numerous washings most xylazine was considered to have been removed from the organ so that its effect on the tissue was negligible. Sample concentration–response curves were then determined, with phenilephrine (1 μM) used as the aorta ring-contraction agonist.
