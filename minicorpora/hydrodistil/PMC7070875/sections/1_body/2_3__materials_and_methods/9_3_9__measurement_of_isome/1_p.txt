0: Adult male albino rats, weighting 200300 g each, were used for all experiments.
1: They were kept in plastic cages at 24 C and were exposed to a photoperiod cycle of 12 h light followed by 12 h darkness.
2: Rats were fed standard diet and tap water.
3: Access to water was free, while food was removed 24 h prior to experiments.
4: Rats were injected intraperitoneally with heparin (1500 units/Kg body weight), then left for 30 min to avoid blood clotting and possible damage of the aorta endothelium, and finally anaesthetized with racemic ketamine (40 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) intraperitoneally.
5: Chest cavity was opened, and excess tissues and fat were removed.
6: Aorta was isolated and transferred to a beaker containing a Krebs solution aerated with 95% O 2 and 5% CO 2, that was placed in a water-bath at 37 C. Subsequently, the aorta was segmented into rings 35 mm long.
7: Isolated thoracic aortic rings were used in preparations with intact endothelium.
8: Aortic rings were mounted between two stainless steel hooks, connected by a thread to a force transducer coupled to a transbridge amplifier and a Power Lab Data Acquisition system (model ML 870, Power Lab, AD Instrument, Sydney, Australia), which was connected to a computer running chart software (Version 7).
9: The isometric force produced was monitored and recorded.
10: Experiments were performed in 10 mL organ baths filled with a physiological Krebs solution (pH = 7.4) maintained at 37 C by means of a thermoregulating system with water continuously circulating throughout a double-walled water-jacketed system, and continuously gassed with 95% O 2 and 5% CO 2.
11: Tension was set at 2 g for 60 min, and the buffer solution was changed every 15 min until the resting tone became constant.
12: After these numerous washings most xylazine was considered to have been removed from the organ so that its effect on the tissue was negligible.
13: Sample concentrationresponse curves were then determined, with phenilephrine (1 M) used as the aorta ring-contraction agonist.
