<p>A sample of powdered dried leaves (250 g) was submitted to CO
 <sub>2</sub> extraction at atmospheric pressure for 2 h, in a home-made glass equipment, according to the method described by Honkanen and Karvonen [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-25-00804" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. An oily residue (EO
 <sub>D</sub>, yield = 0.004%) was obtained which was stored under N
 <sub>2</sub> in a sealed vial at −20 °C until analysis. Given the low yield, CO
 <sub>2</sub> extraction was not repeated.
