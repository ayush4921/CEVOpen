0: A sample of powdered dried leaves (250 g) was submitted to CO 2 extraction at atmospheric pressure for 2 h, in a home-made glass equipment, according to the method described by Honkanen and Karvonen [ 36].
1: An oily residue (EO D, yield = 0.004%) was obtained which was stored under N 2 in a sealed vial at 20 C until analysis.
2: Given the low yield, CO 2 extraction was not repeated.
