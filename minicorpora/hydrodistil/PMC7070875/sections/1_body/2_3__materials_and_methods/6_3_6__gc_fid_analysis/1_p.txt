0: GC-FID analyses of the different volatile fractions (EO) were performed on a Perkin Elmer Auto system gas chromatographer equipped with a HP5 capillary column (25 m  0.32 mm i.d.
1: ; 0.52 m film thickness).
2: Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min.
3: The injector operated in split mode (split ratio 25:1) and was heated at 220 C. The GC oven temperature was hold at 60 C for 1 min, then increased by a gradient of 3 C/min until 100 C, hold at 100 C for 30 min, then increased to 250 C by a gradient of 10 C/min, finally hold at 250 C for 5 min.
4: Each analysis lasted 64.3 min.
5: One microliter of each oil (5% in CH 2Cl 2) was injected in each analysis.
6: Percentages (%) of compounds > 0.01 occurring in each EO ( Table 1) were calculated from the corresponding GC peak areas with respect to the total peak area in the GC-FID chromatogram without applying any correction factor.
7: Three GC-FID analyses were performed for EO S and EO W, while EO A, EO Ar, and EO D were analysed only once.
