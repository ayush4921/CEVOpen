<p>GC-FID analyses of the different volatile fractions (EO) were performed on a Perkin Elmer Auto system gas chromatographer equipped with a HP5 capillary column (25 m × 0.32 mm i.d.; 0.52 µm film thickness). Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min. The injector operated in split mode (split ratio 25:1) and was heated at 220 °C. The GC oven temperature was hold at 60 °C for 1 min, then increased by a gradient of 3 °C/min until 100 °C, hold at 100 °C for 30 min, then increased to 250 °C by a gradient of 10 °C/min, finally hold at 250 °C for 5 min. Each analysis lasted 64.3 min. One microliter of each oil (5% in CH
 <sub>2</sub>Cl
 <sub>2</sub>) was injected in each analysis. Percentages (%) of compounds &gt; 0.01 occurring in each EO (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-00804-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) were calculated from the corresponding GC peak areas with respect to the total peak area in the GC-FID chromatogram without applying any correction factor. Three GC-FID analyses were performed for EO
 <sub>S</sub> and EO
 <sub>W</sub>, while EO
 <sub>A</sub>, EO
 <sub>Ar</sub>, and EO
 <sub>D</sub> were analysed only once.
