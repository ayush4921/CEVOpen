0: The vasorelaxation response, calculated as a percentage of contraction produced by PE or ACh, was expressed as the mean  standard error of the mean (SEM).
1: The base line tension was expressed as a measure of 100% relaxation, and the tension induced by agonist was taken as a measure of 0% relaxation.
2: All data analyses were fitted with a Hill equation, that the median effective concentration (Log of IC 50) value was given as geometric mean with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), using the statistics program GraphPad Prism TM software, version 6 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).
3: Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed, supported with Bonferroni test when carrying out pairwise comparison between the same doses of different groups using GraphPad program.
4: p-Values less than 0.05 ( p< 0.05) were considered significant.
5: Symbols * mean  p< 0.05, **  p< 0.01 and ***  p< 0.001 for all graphs.
