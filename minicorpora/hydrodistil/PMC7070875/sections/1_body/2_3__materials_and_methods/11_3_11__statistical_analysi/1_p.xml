<p>The vasorelaxation response, calculated as a percentage of contraction produced by PE or ACh, was expressed as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). The base line tension was expressed as a measure of 100% relaxation, and the tension induced by agonist was taken as a measure of 0% relaxation. All data analyses were fitted with a Hill equation, that the median effective concentration (Log of IC
 <sub>50</sub>) value was given as geometric mean with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), using the statistics program GraphPad Prism
 <sup>™</sup> software, version 6 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed, supported with Bonferroni test when carrying out pairwise comparison between the same doses of different groups using GraphPad program.
