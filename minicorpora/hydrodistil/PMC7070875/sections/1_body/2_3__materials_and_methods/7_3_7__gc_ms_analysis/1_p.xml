<p>GC-MS analyses of the different volatile fractions (EO) were performed using an Agilent Bench Top GC-MS equipment, comprising a 6890N network gas-chromatographic system combined with a 5973 Network Mass Selective Detector (Agilent Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA), and equipped with a DB-5 glass capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d.; 0.25 µm film thickness). Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Temperature of the injector: 220 °C; oven temperature program: isotherm at 60 °C for 1 min, then increased (3 °C/min) to 270 °C, followed by an isotherm at 270 °C for 5 min. Sample split ratio: 1:20; 1 µL of each oil (5% in CH
 <sub>2</sub>Cl
 <sub>2</sub>) was injected in each analysis. Mass spectra were acquired at 70 eV within a mass range of 41–350 Daltons (Da) with a scan time of 0.73 scans s
 <sup>−1</sup>; ion source temperature: 230 °C. Compound identification was at first based on their linear retention indices (LRIs). They were calculated according to Van Den Dool and Kratz [

 <sub>20</sub> (TPH-6RPM of CHEM SERVICE), which were injected immediately after each oil analysis under the same gas-chromatographic conditions. Calculated LRIs were compared with the retention indices of authentic samples or literature data [
