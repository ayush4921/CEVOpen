0: GC-MS analyses of the different volatile fractions (EO) were performed using an Agilent Bench Top GC-MS equipment, comprising a 6890N network gas-chromatographic system combined with a 5973 Network Mass Selective Detector (Agilent Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA), and equipped with a DB-5 glass capillary column (30 m  0.25 mm i.d.
1: ; 0.25 m film thickness).
2: Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 mL/min.
3: Temperature of the injector: 220 C; oven temperature program: isotherm at 60 C for 1 min, then increased (3 C/min) to 270 C, followed by an isotherm at 270 C for 5 min.
4: Sample split ratio: 1:20; 1 L of each oil (5% in CH 2Cl 2) was injected in each analysis.
5: Mass spectra were acquired at 70 eV within a mass range of 41350 Daltons (Da) with a scan time of 0.73 scans s 1; ion source temperature: 230 C. Compound identification was at first based on their linear retention indices (LRIs).
6: They were calculated according to Van Den Dool and Kratz [ 20], with reference to a homologous series of  n-alkanes C 6-C 20 (TPH-6RPM of CHEM SERVICE), which were injected immediately after each oil analysis under the same gas-chromatographic conditions.
7: Calculated LRIs were compared with the retention indices of authentic samples or literature data [ 18, 19].
8: Comparison of the retention indices was considered reasonable in a range of 20 units.
9: The identity of each EO constituents was confirmed by comparing the mass spectral fragmentation patterns with those reported in the literature [ 18, 19, 21] and, whenever possible, with the GC-MS data of pure standard compounds.
