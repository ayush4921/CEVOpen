0: Trachea was removed from anaesthetized rats, cleaned, and segmented into 35 mm long rings (each containing 34 cartilaginous rings).
1: Measurements of the isometric force with isolated tracheal rings were then performed according to international standard procedures for in vitro study using organ bath.
2: Rings were suspended in 10 mL organ baths filled with physiological Krebs solution (pH = 7.4), maintained at 37 C by a thermoregulating system with continuous water circulating throughout a double walled water jacket system, and aerated with 95% O 2 and 5% CO 2.
3: Tracheal rings were maintained under an isometric tension of 2 g and allowed to stabilize for 60 min, while changing the Krebs solution every 15 min.
4: After these numerous washings most xylazine was considered to have been removed from trachea so that its effect on the tissue was negligible.
5: Concentrationresponse curves ( Figure 3,  Figure 4,  Figure 5 and  Figure 6 and  Table 3) were then determined adding increasing amounts of EO S and 1,8-cineole, in separate experiments.
6: ACh (10 M) was used as the tracheal ring-contraction agonist.
7: In subsequent experiments, increasing amounts of EO S were added to tracheal rings preincubated with the K + channel blocker TEA (1 mM) for 20 min and then precontracted with ACh (10 M).
8: Analogous experiments were performed with tracheal rings preincubated with nifedipine (30 M) for 10 min prior to precontraction with ACh (10 M).
9: Finally, tracheal rings were preincubated with L-NAME (0.3 mM) for 10 min.
10: prior to precontraction with ACh (10 M); then, increasing amounts of EO S were added.
