<p>Trachea was removed from anaesthetized rats, cleaned, and segmented into 3–5 mm long rings (each containing 3–4 cartilaginous rings). Measurements of the isometric force with isolated tracheal rings were then performed according to international standard procedures for in vitro study using organ bath. Rings were suspended in 10 mL organ baths filled with physiological Krebs solution (pH = 7.4), maintained at 37 °C by a thermoregulating system with continuous water circulating throughout a double walled water jacket system, and aerated with 95% O
 <sub>2</sub> and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Tracheal rings were maintained under an isometric tension of 2 g and allowed to stabilize for 60 min, while changing the Krebs solution every 15 min. After these numerous washings most xylazine was considered to have been removed from trachea so that its effect on the tissue was negligible. Concentration–response curves (

 <sub>S</sub> and 1,8-cineole, in separate experiments. ACh (10 μM) was used as the tracheal ring-contraction agonist. In subsequent experiments, increasing amounts of EO
 <sub>S</sub> were added to tracheal rings preincubated with the K
 <sup>+</sup> channel blocker TEA (1 mM) for 20 min and then precontracted with ACh (10 μM). Analogous experiments were performed with tracheal rings preincubated with nifedipine (30 μM) for 10 min prior to precontraction with ACh (10 μM). Finally, tracheal rings were preincubated with L-NAME (0.3 mM) for 10 min. prior to precontraction with ACh (10 μM); then, increasing amounts of EO
 <sub>S</sub> were added.
