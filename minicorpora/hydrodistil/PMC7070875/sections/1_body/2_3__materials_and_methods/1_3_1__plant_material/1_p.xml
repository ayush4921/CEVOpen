The plant is neither endangered nor protected in Kurdistan, and no specific permission was required for the collection. A voucher has been deposited at the Herbarium with the accession number AC031. The leaves were rinsed with tap water, air-dried for about twenty days at 20–25 °C in the shade, and ground in an electrical mill (IKA-WERKE, Staufen im Breisgau, Germany) to a fine powder just prior to extraction.
