0: Five volatile fractions EO were obtained as dense oils by two different procedures: (i) Hydrodistillation provided fractions EO S, EO W, EO A, and EOAr (see  Section 3.3); (ii) CO 2 extraction at atmospheric pressure afforded fraction EO D (see  Section 3.4).
1: All samples were dissolved in dichloromethane and analyzed by GC-FID and GC-MS.
