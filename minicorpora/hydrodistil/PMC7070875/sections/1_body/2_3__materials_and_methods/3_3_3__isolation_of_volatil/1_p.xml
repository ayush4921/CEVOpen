<p>Five volatile fractions EO were obtained as dense oils by two different procedures: (i) Hydrodistillation provided fractions EO
 <sub>S</sub>, EO
 <sub>W</sub>, EO
 <sub>A</sub>, and EOAr (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3dot3-molecules-25-00804">Section 3.3</xref>); (ii) CO
 <sub>2</sub> extraction at atmospheric pressure afforded fraction EO
 <sub>D</sub> (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3dot4-molecules-25-00804">Section 3.4</xref>). All samples were dissolved in dichloromethane and analyzed by GC-FID and GC-MS.
