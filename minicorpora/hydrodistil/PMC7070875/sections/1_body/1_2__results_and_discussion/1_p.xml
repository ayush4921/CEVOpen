<p>Powdered air-dried leaves of 
 <italic>E. camaldulensis</italic> were hydrodistilled in a standard Clevenger-type apparatus, by two different procedures, A and B, which are described in detail in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3dot4-molecules-25-00804">Section 3.4</xref>. An oily volatile fraction, named EO
 <sub>S</sub> was obtained by procedure A, named hydrodistillation with circulating-water. Three oils, named EO
 <sub>W</sub>, EO
 <sub>A</sub>, and EO
 <sub>Ar</sub> were obtained by procedure B, named hydrodistillation with non-circulating water. Another crop of dried leaves was submitted to CO
 <sub>2</sub> extraction at atmospheric pressure (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3dot5-molecules-25-00804">Section 3.5</xref>), which afforded an oily residue, named EO
 <sub>D</sub>. All the five oils had a pale yellowish color. They remained liquid even on storage at −20 °C in sealed vials and emanated a sharp and very distinct minty/pine smell. Each sample was dissolved in dichloromethane and analyzed by GC-FID and GC-MS.
