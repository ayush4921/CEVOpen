<p>In another experiment, we measured the relaxation induced by EO
 <sub>S</sub> in tracheal rings precontracted with ACh (10 μM) and preincubated with the L-type Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> channel blocker nifedipine (30 μM). The corresponding concentration–response curve with respect to the control is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-00804-f005">Figure 5</xref>. In tracheal smooth muscle, blockade of voltage dependent Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> channels (VDCs) by nifedipine at the extracellular surface of the membrane may attenuate bronchoconstriction [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-25-00804" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Spasm evoked by ACh and the maintenance of spontaneous tone largely depend on mechanisms for increasing the cytoplasmic concentration of free Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> which are resistant to nifedipine [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-25-00804" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In the event, the relaxation effect induced by EO
 <sub>S</sub> was significantly reduced, suggesting that the presence of active constituents in the EO
 <sub>S</sub> can cause tracheal relaxation via the inhibition of Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> influx through the plasma membrane in tracheal smooth muscle.
