 <sub>S</sub>. Therefore, the K
 <sub>Ca</sub> channel and NO release and activation of the NO-cGMP pathway were not significantly involved in the relaxation mechanism. Instead, the inhibitory effect of EO
 <sub>S</sub> in tracheal rings preincubated with nifedipine blocked the concentration–response relaxation, indicating that L-type Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> channels were significantly (P &lt; 0.001) involved in the relaxation mechanism.
