<p>In the last experiment, the relaxant effect of EO
 <sub>S</sub> in tracheal rings precontracted with ACh and preincubated with NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) was measured. L-NAME is a very well-known endothelial NO synthase inhibitor. The concentrationâ€“response curve of EO
 <sub>S</sub>, compared to the control, is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-00804-f006">Figure 6</xref>. The graphic shows that the relaxation was attenuated to some extent; however, EO
 <sub>S</sub> was still quite effective (45.41% relaxation).
