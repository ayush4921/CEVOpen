<p>The concentration–response curve for the effect exerted by EO
 <sub>S</sub> against tracheal rings precontracted with ACh (10 μM) and preincubated with the calcium-activated K
 <sup>+</sup> (K
 <sub>Ca</sub>) channel blocker tetraethyl ammonium chloride (TEA), is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-00804-f004">Figure 4</xref>, in comparison with the curve of the control. The two curves were almost superimposed, indicating that the inhibition of the K
 <sub>Ca</sub> channel was not a significant signaling pathway.
