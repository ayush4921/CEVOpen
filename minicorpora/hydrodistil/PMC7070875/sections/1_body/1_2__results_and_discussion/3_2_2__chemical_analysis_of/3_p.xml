<p>Our data clearly showed that a significant quantity of oxygenated components remained dispersed in the aqueous phase collected in the condenser during leaf hydrodistillation. Therefore, we considered that a more accurate analysis of 
 <italic>E. camaldulensis</italic> volatiles should include not only the components of the oil separated from the hydrosol, i.e., EO
 <sub>W</sub>, but also the mixture of polar compounds dispersed in the water condensed during the distillation process, i.e., EO
 <sub>A</sub> and EO
 <sub>Ar</sub>. To this purpose, the column EO
 <sub>Tot</sub> in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-00804-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the sum of the percentages of each compound occurring in EO
 <sub>W</sub>, EO
 <sub>A</sub>, and EO
 <sub>Ar</sub>, averaged by the weight of each fraction. It thus resulted that the percentage of oxygenated monoterpenoids in the total volatile fraction EO
 <sub>Tot</sub> was significantly higher than in the fraction EO
 <sub>W</sub> alone, while that of hydrocarbons was lower. Only twelve components of EO
 <sub>Tot</sub> had an abundance &gt; 1%, namely, 1,8-cineole (
 <bold>1</bold>, 55.83%), 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (
 <bold>2</bold>, 4.80%), terpinen-4-ol (
 <bold>4</bold>, 4.56%), α-terpineol (
 <bold>6</bold>, 4.38%), aromadendrene (
 <bold>5</bold>, 2.97%), cryptone (2.90%), α-pinene (
 <bold>3</bold>, 2.73%), spathulenol (2.08%), 9-
 <italic>epi</italic>-(
 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene (1.91%), 
 <italic>p</italic>-mentha-3,8-diene (1.66%), globulol (1.48%), and 
 <italic>p</italic>-menth-1-en-7-al (1.02%), which together accounted for 86.32% EO
 <sub>Tot</sub>.
