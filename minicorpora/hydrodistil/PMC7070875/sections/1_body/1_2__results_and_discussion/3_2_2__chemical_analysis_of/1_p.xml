<p>The chemical compositions of the five different oily volatile fractions (EO) obtained by hydrodistillation (procedures A and B) and by CO

 <xref rid="molecules-25-00804-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, together with the corresponding component percentages from GC-FID chromatograms and calculated linear retention indices (LRI). 31 components were identified in the volatile mixture EO
 <sub>S</sub>. Major components (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-00804-f001">Figure 1</xref>) were 1,8-cineole (
