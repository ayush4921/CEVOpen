<p>Phytochemical results indicate that three chemotypes of 
 <italic>E. camaldulensis</italic> can be distinguished on the basis of the main components of the oil obtained by hydrodistillation under analogous conditions: one rich in 1,8-cineole (28–84%), one rich in 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (20–30%) and one rich in spathulenol (18%) [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-25-00804" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-25-00804" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. For example, the essential oil from 
 <italic>E. camaldulensis</italic> leaves collected in Pakistan contained high concentration of oxygenated sesquiterpenes [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-25-00804" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], while the main components of the leaf oil hydrodistilled from 
 <italic>E. camaldulensis</italic> collected in Iran were 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (68.43%), 1,8-cineole (13.92%), α-pinene (3.45%), and limonene (2.84%) [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-25-00804" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Therefore, the compositions of EOs and EO
 <sub>W</sub> clearly indicate that the variety of 
 <italic>E. camaldulensis</italic> growing in Kurdistan can be classified as a chemotype with high 1,8-cineole and low 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene contents.
