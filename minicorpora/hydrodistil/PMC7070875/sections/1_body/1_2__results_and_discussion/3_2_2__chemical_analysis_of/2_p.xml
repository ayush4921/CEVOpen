<p>Considering all the volatile fractions (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-00804-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), a total of sixty compounds were identified. They comprise 53 terpenoids, among which monoterpenoids (32) exceeded sesquiterpenoids (21) in number and total percentage. Oxygenated monoterpenoids (28) represented by far the most abundant family, followed by monoterpene hydrocarbons, whose number (4) was less than sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (12). 1,8-Cineole (eucalyptol) (
 <bold>1</bold>) was the most abundant oil component, followed by 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (
 <bold>2</bold>), α-pinene (
 <bold>3</bold>), terpinen-4-ol (
 <bold>4</bold>), aromadendrene (
 <bold>5</bold>), and α-terpineol (
 <bold>6</bold>). Comparing the three different distillation procedures, hydrodistillation, either in mode A or B, afforded two oils, EO
 <sub>S</sub> and EO
 <sub>W</sub>, in comparable yields, and having similar composition, and percentages of most components. In contrast, CO
 <sub>2</sub> extraction was rather inefficient both in terms of oil (EO
 <sub>D</sub>) yield and chemical composition. In fact, only the rather non-polar compound 1,8-cineole (
 <bold>1</bold>) appeared to be removed from air-dried leaves in an efficient manner. The comparison of EO
 <sub>A</sub> and EO
 <sub>Ar</sub> with EO
 <sub>W</sub> clearly showed that, as expected, the aqueous phase collected in the condenser was enriched in polar oxygenated monoterpenoids and sesquiterpenoids compared to non-polar terpenoid hydrocarbons. Specifically, borneol, terpinen-4-ol (
 <bold>4</bold>), cryptone, α-terpineol (
 <bold>6</bold>), and spathulenol exhibited a significant water solubility. Noticeable amounts of 1,8-cineole (
 <bold>1</bold>) were also dispersed in the aqueous phase. Moreover, comparison of EO
 <sub>Ar</sub> with EO
 <sub>A</sub> indicated that minor amounts of the most polar terpenoids were not completely removed from the aqueous phase by solid phase extraction (SPE, see
