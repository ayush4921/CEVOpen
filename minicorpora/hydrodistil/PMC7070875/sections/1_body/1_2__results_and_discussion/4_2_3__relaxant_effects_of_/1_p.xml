<p>In a preliminary study we showed that the essential oil of 
 <italic>E. camaldulensis</italic> produced a potent dilation in aortic force development probably acting as a Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> channel antagonism and partially via NO and cyclooxygenase pathways [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-25-00804" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. To investigate the relationship between oil composition and in vivo spasmolytic effects, the vasorelaxant effects of volatile fractions EO
 <sub>S</sub>, EO
 <sub>W</sub>, and EO
 <sub>Ar</sub> on isolated rat aortic rings were determined separately, following the same procedure described previously [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-25-00804" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The concentration–response curves for the oil-induced relaxation against phenylephrine (PE)-induced contractions are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-00804-f002">Figure 2</xref>, while the percentages of relaxation, the values of Log EC
 <sub>50</sub>, and 95% CI (Confidence Interval) for Log EC
 <sub>50</sub> are shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-00804-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The curves show that the cumulative addition of the three samples at the plateau of contraction caused a relaxant effect in a concentration-dependent manner, with a strong potent dilation. Relaxation caused by EO
 <sub>W</sub> did not differ significantly from EO
 <sub>S</sub>, as it could be anticipated by the comparable chemical compositions of the two oils; instead, significantly minor relaxation effects were observed for EO
 <sub>Ar</sub>. This finding seems to indicate that the reduced relaxant properties of EO
 <sub>Ar</sub>, compared to EO
 <sub>S</sub> and EO
 <sub>W</sub>, is caused by the minor amount of 1,8-cineole (
 <bold>1</bold>) in EO
 <sub>Ar</sub> (10.14%) than in EO
 <sub>S</sub> (62.70%) and EO
 <sub>W</sub> (59.09%). However, the physiological effects of EO
 <sub>Ar</sub> were not totally suppressed, due to the significant presence of other active terpenoids (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-00804-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), such as α-terpineol (
 <bold>6</bold>, 17.26%) [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-25-00804" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], spathulenol (5.74%) [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-25-00804" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], carvacrol (2.73%), and thymol (2.52%) [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-25-00804" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].
