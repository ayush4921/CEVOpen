<p>Since the oil EO
 <sub>S</sub> showed the highest activity on rat aortic rings, compared to EO
 <sub>W</sub> and EOAr, we deemed it to be interesting to measure the relaxant effect of this volatile fraction also in rat tracheal rings. Moreover, the major component of EO
 <sub>S</sub>, namely the monoterpenoid 1,8-cineole (
 <bold>1</bold>), was also tested in parallel experiments. In fact, it is well-known that 1,8-cineole (
 <bold>1</bold>) displays a wide range of biological effects, including muscle relaxant, bronchodilatatory [

 <xref rid="B31-molecules-25-00804" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] properties. Therefore 1,8-cineole (1) was used as the reference compound and its contribution to the biological activity of the volatile fraction EO
 <sub>S</sub> was roughly estimated. The concentration–response curves for 1,8-cineole (
 <bold>1</bold>) and EO
 <sub>S</sub> relaxant effects against acetyl choline (ACh)-induced contractions are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-00804-f003">Figure 3</xref>. The percentages of relaxation were 33.01% and 79.44% for 1,8-cineole (
 <bold>1</bold>) and EO
 <sub>S</sub>, respectively. On the other hand, the Log EC
 <sub>50</sub> were 1.030 and 0.508 (mg/mL), respectively. These results clearly indicated that both 1,8-cineole (
 <bold>1</bold>) and EO
 <sub>S</sub> produced potent concentration-dependent relaxation in rat tracheal rings precontracted with ACh (10 μM), although the activity of EO
 <sub>S</sub> was much higher than that of 1,8-cineole (
 <bold>1</bold>) alone. These findings nicely agree with the results of other authors who suggested that the relaxant [
