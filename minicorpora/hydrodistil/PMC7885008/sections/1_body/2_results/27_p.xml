<p> In 2011, the effects of different isolation approaches on the quality and quantity of EOs of different sections of 
 <italic>A.orientalis </italic>were studied and the antibacterial activities against 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> were investigated. The results of this study showed that the EOs obtained by different extraction methods differed in composition. MICs of the EO of 
 <italic>A. orientalis</italic> L. were determined by the agar dilution method with respect to different test microorganisms, including Gram-negative (
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> PTCC 1330) and Grampositive (
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> ATCC 6633) bacteria. These EOs showed good activities against both bacteria (0.5â€“1.5 mg/ml) (
