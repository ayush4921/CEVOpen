<p>The extract of leaves, flowers and stems of another species,
 <italic> A. orientalis</italic> L. obtained by hydrodistillation, showed that β-pinene (20.5%), α-thujene (8.7%0) and α-pinene (7.6%) were the main constituents of the flowers, sabinene (11.8%), α-pinene (8.7%), and 
 <italic>p</italic>-mycrene (2.5%) for the stem, and α-pinene (9.4%), sabinene (13.5%), β-pinene (6.3%), and 
 <italic>p</italic>-mycrene (3.2%) for the leaf (

 <italic>A. orientalis</italic>) leaves and seeds were analyzed by Mirza et al. and the chief components of the leaf EO were fenchylacetate (44.5%) and α-pinene (21.6%), whilethe major constituents ofthe seed EO were myrcene (47.7%) and β-pinene (21.8%). The seed EO was found to contain lower amounts of bornyl acetate, germacrene D and δ-cadinene than the leaf oil (
