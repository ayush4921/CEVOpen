<p>Total antioxidant activity of root fractions and aerial parts EOs was measured according to standard curve of FeSO
 <sub>4</sub>. Total root extract had the greatest reducing capacity (881.5 mmol Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>/100 g), which was more than vitamin E (313.7 mmol Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>/100 g), and comparable with BHA (880.3 mol Fe 
 <sup>2+</sup>/100 g). The flowers/fruits EO had potent reducing capacity (686.6 mmol Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>/100 g) higher than vitamin E. The lowest antioxidant activity was observed for HE and methanol (ME) fractions (
