<p>The distribution profile of the constituents of theEO of the stems, the fruits and the umbels of 
 <italic>A. oriantalis </italic>was quite similar, especially considering theoccurrence and quantity of sabinene, myrecene, 
 <italic>para</italic>-cymene, α-pinene, β-pinene, terpineol-4, fenchyl acetate and germacerene D. But, there were considerablevariations in the chemical profiles of the EO of the roots and aerial parts, Phenolic compound slike acetophenone and anisole were found in EO of the roots while they were not present in the EO of the aerial parts (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Nazemiyeh et al., 2009</xref>). On the basis of findingsfrom previous studies, it is reasonable to state that fenchyl acetate and α-pinene could be used as chemotaxonomic markers inthe species of the genus 
 <italic>Astrodaucus</italic>, at least in two Iranian species (

 <italic>A. orientalis </italic>(

 <italic>A. orientalis</italic> showed high amounts of copper (0.47 mg/100 g), manganese (0.90 mg/100 g) and iron (7.12 mg/100 g) (
