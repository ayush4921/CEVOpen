<p> In addition to chemical anticancer compounds, several anticancer compounds that act via various mechanisms of action, have been extracted from plant sources, valuable economic plants such as

 <italic>Betula alba, Erythroxylumprevillei,</italic> and many others (

 <italic>vinca </italic>and cytotoxic podophyllotoxins were discovered as the first anticancer compounds from plants (
