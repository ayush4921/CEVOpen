 <caption> RMSD of systems for 100 ns of MD simulations. The black colour was used to colour the backbone of all proteins, whereas various colours were used for the ligand RMSD. ( a) RMSD plot of the atractylon/N-myristoyltransferase system ( C. albicans), ( b) RMSD plot of the atractylon/Enoyl reductase system ( E. coli), ( c) RMSD plot of the atractylon/Carbamate kinase system ( E. faecalis), and ( d) RMSD plot of the atractylon/Sortase A system ( S. mutans). </caption>
