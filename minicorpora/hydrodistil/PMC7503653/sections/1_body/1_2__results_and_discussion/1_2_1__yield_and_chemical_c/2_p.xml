<p>In a study related to the chemical composition of 
 <italic>S. guianensis</italic> essential oil from southeastern Brazil, they obtained high concentrations of capric acid (46.6%) and 2-undecane (31.7%) [

 <xref rid="B42-molecules-25-03852" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], who analysed the chemical composition of 
 <italic>S. guianensis</italic> essential oil, collected in various cities of Northern Brazil and identified epi-α-bisabolol (25.1%) and spathulenol (15.7%) in Moju (PA), spathulenol (22.0%), selin-11-en-4α-ol (19.4%), β-eudesmol (10.0%), and elemol (10.0%) in leaves collected in Rio Branco (AC), and germacrone (23.2%), germacrene D (10.9%), bicyclogermacrene (8.6%), germacrene B (8.0%) and atractylon (31.4%) in Belém (PA). The results found in other studies [

 <xref rid="B45-molecules-25-03852" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] show that the chemical composition of the essential oil of 
 <italic>S. guianensis</italic> varies according to the seasonality and site of collection.
