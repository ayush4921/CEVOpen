<p>The moisture content of the 
 <italic>S. guianensis</italic> sample was 13.58% and the volume of essential oil obtained in the hydrodistillation was 0.5 mL, with a yield of 1.42% (db). Regarding the chemical profile of the essential oil of 
 <italic>S.guianensis</italic>, 51 compounds were identified, the most important being 
 <italic>trans</italic>-β-Elemenone (11.78%) and Atractylone (18.65%), followed by δ-Elemene (5.38%), β-Elemene (3.13%), β- Yerangene (4.14%), γ-Elemene (7.04%), Germacrene D (7.61%), Curzerene (7.1%), and Germacrone (5.26%) (See

 <italic>Siparuna thecaphora</italic> obtained by hydrodistillation and the compounds obtained in the highest concentrations were germacrene D (32.7%), α-pinene (16.3%), β-pinene (13.8%), and e β-caryophyllene (4.1%). In a similar study with 
 <italic>Siparuna guianensis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-25-03852" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], they found myrcene (28.74%) [
