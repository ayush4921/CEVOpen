<p>For the study of molecular docking, atractylone was selected, since it was the primary compound from the essential oil isolated from the leaves of 
 <italic>Siparuna guianensis</italic>. Molecular docking was used to investigate the interaction between atractylone and essential proteins of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. mutans</italic>. The proteins used as a molecular target are essential for the metabolic pathways of such microorganisms, in addition to being reported in the literature as targets for natural and synthetic products that combat these pathogens [
