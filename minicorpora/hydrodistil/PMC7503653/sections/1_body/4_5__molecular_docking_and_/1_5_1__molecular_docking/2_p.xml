<p>The chemical structure of atractylon, after being designed with GaussView 5.5 software - Wallingford, Connecticut United States, was optimized with B3LYP/6-31G* [
 <xref rid="B61-molecules-25-03852" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], using Gaussian 16 (Wallingford, CT, USA) [
 <xref rid="B62-molecules-25-03852" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. To study the interaction mode of this molecule with target-proteins for drug action, the software Molegro Virtual Docker 6 (Århus, Denmark, 
 <uri xlink:href="https://molegrovirtualdocker.weebly.com/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://molegrovirtualdocker.weebly.com/</uri>) was used [

 <xref rid="B60-molecules-25-03852" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. The MolDock Score (GRID) function was used with a Grid resolution of 0.30 Å and radius of 7 Å, encompassing the entire crystallographic ligand binding cavity found in the PDB of each protein. The MolDock SE algorithm was used with number of runs equal to 10; 1500 max interactions, and max population size equal to 50. The maximum evaluation of 300 steps with neighbor distance factor equal to 1 and energy threshold equal to 100 were used during the molecular docking simulation. The RMSD limit for multiple cluster poses was set to &lt; 1.00 Å.
