<p>The energy minimization of the systems occurred in three stages. In the first step, 1500 cycles were performed using steepest descent method and conjugate gradient algorithm, applying a harmonic force constant of 100 kcal/mol.Å
 <sup>−2</sup> on the solute. In the second step, the harmonic force constant applied on the solute was 50 kcal/mol.Å
 <sup>−2</sup> and further 500 cycles were performed using the steepest descent method and conjugate gradient algorithm. In the last step, the restrictions were removed, and 500 cycles were performed using the same protocol.
