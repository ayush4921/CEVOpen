<p>To raise the systems temperature from 0 to 300k, 800 ps of simulations were performed. The heating was carried out in three stages. In the first stage, the solute was restricted with a harmonic force constant of 50 kcal/mol.Å
 <sup>−2</sup>. Thus, only the solvent and the counter-ions get free to move. In the next two steps, the harmonic force constant was removed.
