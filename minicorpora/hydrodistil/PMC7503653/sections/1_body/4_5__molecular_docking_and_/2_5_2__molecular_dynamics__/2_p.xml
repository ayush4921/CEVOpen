<p>In the molecular dynamics simulations, the force field ff14SB [

 <xref rid="B70-molecules-25-03852" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] were used. All systems were solvated in an octahedron periodic box, where a cutting radius of 12Ã… was applied in all directions from the solute. Finally, in each system, an adequate number of counter-ions were added to neutralize the charge.
