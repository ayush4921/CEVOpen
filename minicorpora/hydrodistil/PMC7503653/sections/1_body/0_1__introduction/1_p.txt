0: Fungi and bacteria can cause various pathologies in humans.
1: Leprosy [ 1], tuberculosis [ 2], bacterial dysentery [ 3], gonorrhea [ 4], urinary tract infection, endocarditis [ 5, 6], onychomycosis [ 7], mucormycosis [ 8], and candidiasis [ 9] are examples of diseases that these microorganisms can cause.
2: In some cases, the symbiosis between bacteria and fungi increases the virulence of bacteria, because fungi such as  C. albicans elevates the production of exopolysaccharides, which can become an ideal shelter for  S. mutans, thus making it difficult to control this microorganism [ 10].
3: Another important factor is the resistance that microorganisms are developing to traditional antibiotics, since this poses a threat to public health and is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality [ 11].
4: In this sense, natural products, more specifically essential oils, can become a viable alternative for the control of fungi and bacteria [ 12, 13].
