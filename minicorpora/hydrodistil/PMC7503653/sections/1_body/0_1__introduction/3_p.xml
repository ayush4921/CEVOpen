 <italic>Siparuna guianensis</italic> was the first 
 <italic>Siparuna</italic> species described and illustrated by Aublet [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-25-03852" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This plant is present from Nicaragua to Paraguay, and in Brazil, this species is known by several names, such as 
 <italic>negramina</italic>, 
 <italic>folha</italic>-
 <italic>santa</italic>, 
 <italic>marinheiro</italic>, 
 <italic>capitiú</italic>, 
 <italic>mata</italic>-
 <italic>cachorro</italic>,

 <italic>cicatrizante</italic>-
 <italic>das</italic>-
 <italic>guianas</italic>, 
 <italic>catingueira</italic>-
 <italic>de</italic>-
 <italic>paca</italic>, and 
 <italic>fedegoso</italic>. In many countries of America, leaves of 
 <italic>S. guianensis</italic> are widely used as a drink to combat stomach pains [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-25-03852" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and this activity may be related to the compounds present in its essential oil [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-25-03852" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-25-03852" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In addition, there is little research that reports on the antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic>Siparuna guianensis</italic> essential oil, [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-25-03852" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] including a chemotype found in Tocantins, Brazil. In this context, the objective of this work was to evaluate the chemical composition, antimicrobial activity and simulate the mechanisms of interaction of the major chemical constituent present in the essential oil of 
 <italic>Siparuna guianensis</italic>, using doping techniques and molecular dynamics.
