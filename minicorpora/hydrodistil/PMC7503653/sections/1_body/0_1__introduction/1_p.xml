 <xref rid="B9-molecules-25-03852" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] are examples of diseases that these microorganisms can cause. In some cases, the symbiosis between bacteria and fungi increases the virulence of bacteria, because fungi such as 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> elevates the production of exopolysaccharides, which can become an ideal shelter for 
 <italic>S. mutans</italic>, thus making it difficult to control this microorganism [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-25-03852" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Another important factor is the resistance that microorganisms are developing to traditional antibiotics, since this poses a threat to public health and is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-25-03852" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In this sense, natural products, more specifically essential oils, can become a viable alternative for the control of fungi and bacteria [
