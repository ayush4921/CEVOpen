0: Siparuna guianensis was the first  Siparuna species described and illustrated by Aublet [ 33].
1: This plant is present from Nicaragua to Paraguay, and in Brazil, this species is known by several names, such as  negramina,  folha- santa,  marinheiro,  capitiu,  mata- cachorro,  catingoso,  limao- bravo,  cicatrizante- das- guianas,  catingueira- de- paca, and  fedegoso.
2: In many countries of America, leaves of  S. guianensis are widely used as a drink to combat stomach pains [ 34] and this activity may be related to the compounds present in its essential oil [ 35, 36].
3: In addition, there is little research that reports on the antimicrobial activity of  Siparuna guianensis essential oil, [ 37] including a chemotype found in Tocantins, Brazil.
4: In this context, the objective of this work was to evaluate the chemical composition, antimicrobial activity and simulate the mechanisms of interaction of the major chemical constituent present in the essential oil of  Siparuna guianensis, using doping techniques and molecular dynamics.
