<p>Briefly, 10 mL of Soybean Casein Agar (15 × 100 mm) was poured into a Petri dish. The microorganism (106 CFU/mL) was then inoculated with the aid of a sterile swab and paper discs (6 and 8 m) impregnated with 10 μL of oil. Positive and negative control were added onto the medium. The plates were incubated at 30 ± 5 °C/24 h in an aerobic environment [
