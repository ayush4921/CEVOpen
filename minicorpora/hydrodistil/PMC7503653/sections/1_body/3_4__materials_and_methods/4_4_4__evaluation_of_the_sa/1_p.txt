0: Briefly, 10 mL of Soybean Casein Agar (15  100 mm) was poured into a Petri dish.
1: The microorganism (106 CFU/mL) was then inoculated with the aid of a sterile swab and paper discs (6 and 8 m) impregnated with 10 L of oil.
2: Positive and negative control were added onto the medium.
3: The plates were incubated at 30  5 C/24 h in an aerobic environment [ 22, 55, 56].
4: The analysis was performed in triplicate.
5: After the incubation period, the plates were revealed with triphenyltetrazolic chloride at 7 mg/mL in bacteriological agar at 1% ( w/ v).
6: The halos were measured using a pachymeter (mm) and evaluated by a descriptive analysis.
