<p>After the drying process, the leaves of 
 <italic>S. guianensis</italic> were submitted to hydrodistillation using a Clevenger-type extractor. For the extraction process, 40 g of the sample was used, for 10,800 s at 100 Â°C. After this procedure, anhydrous sodium sulphate (Na
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>) was added and the essential oil was centrifuged to be moisture-free. The essential oil yield was calculated in dry basis (db).
