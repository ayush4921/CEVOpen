0: The chemical composition of the essential oils was evaluated by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) according to the methodologies by [ 53, 54], using a Shimadzu QP-2010 plus system under the following conditions: silica capillary column Rtx-5MS (30 m  0.25 mm, 0.25 m film thickness); program temperature of 60240 C at 3 C/min; injector temperature of 250 C; helium as carrier gas (linear velocity of 32 cm/s, measured at 100 C); splitless injection (1 L of a 2:1000 hexane solution).
1: Ionization was obtained by electronic impact technique at 70 eV, and the temperature of the ion source and other parts was set at 200 C. The quantification of volatile compounds was determined by gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector (FID; Shimadzu, QP 2010 system-Kyoto, Japan) under the same conditions as gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS), except that hydrogen was used as the carrier gas.
2: The retention index was calculated for all volatile constituents using a homologous series of n-alkanes (C 8C 20), and were identified by comparing the mass spectra obtained experimentally and their retention indices to those found in literature [ 46, 47].
