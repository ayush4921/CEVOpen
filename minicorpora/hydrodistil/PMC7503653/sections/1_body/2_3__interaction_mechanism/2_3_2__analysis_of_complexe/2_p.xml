<p>For the systems formed with the target proteins of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic> and 
 <italic>S. mutans</italic>, the mean RMSD obtained for the ligand was 0.65 Å, 0.62 Å, 0.66 Å, and 0.64 Å, respectively. Thus, it is possible to infer that during the simulations, the inhibitor remained stable at the binding site of the different targets during molecular dynamics.
