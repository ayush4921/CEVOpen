<p>The complexes obtained by molecular docking were used as a starting point for molecular dynamics simulations. The root mean square deviation (RMSD) graphs were plotted in relation to the lowest energy structure obtained for the systems, after the execution of the protocol of energy minimization, heating, and equilibrium. To plot the RMSD of the proteins’ backbone, their Cα atoms were used and to plot the RMSD of the ligands, their heavy atoms were used. The correspondent graphs can be seen in
