<p>The fluctuations observed in the RMSD for the proteins backbone may be the result of the accommodation of the ligand at the active site. The mean values for the RMSD were relatively low. These values for the backbone of the target proteins of 
 <italic>C. albicans, E. coli, E. faecalis</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. mutans</italic> were 1.63 Å, 1.53 Å, 1.44 Å, and 1.65 Å, respectively.
