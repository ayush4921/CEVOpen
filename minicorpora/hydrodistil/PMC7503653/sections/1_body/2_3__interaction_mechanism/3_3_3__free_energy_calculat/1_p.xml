<p>For each complex, the values of affinity energy (ΔG
 <sub>MM-GBSA</sub>), in addition to the values of the energetic contributions involved in the ligand-receptor interaction were obtained. The energy contributions obtained were as follows: van der Waals (ΔE
 <sub>vdW</sub>), polar (ΔG
 <sub>GB</sub>), non-polar (ΔG
 <sub>NP</sub>), and the electrostatic interactions energies (ΔE
 <sub>ele</sub>) (
