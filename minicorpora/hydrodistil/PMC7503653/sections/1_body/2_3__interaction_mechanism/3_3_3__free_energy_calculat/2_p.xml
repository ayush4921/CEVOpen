<p>In all systems, the free energy values demonstrated that atractylon is capable of inhibiting enzymatic activity. The contributions of Van der Waals were the most responsible for the interaction of the ligand with the molecular targets. Moreover, the electrostatic and nonpolar contributions were favourable for the maintenance of the complexes.</p>
