 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03852-f002">Figure 2</xref>A, it is possible to observe that the ligand performed several hydrophobic interactions with different residues of the catalytic site of N-myristoyltransferase (
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>). With the Tyr225 residue, two interactions were established, one of the pi-pi types and the other of the pi-alkyl type. Residues Phe339 and Tyr354 had pi-alkyl-type interactions with the ligand, whereas Leu394 established alkyl interactions. Phe117 was also able to form two interactions, both of the pi-alkyl type.
