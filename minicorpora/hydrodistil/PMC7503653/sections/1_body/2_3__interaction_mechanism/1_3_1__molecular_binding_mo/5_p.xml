 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03852-f002">Figure 2</xref>C. With residues Val231, Cys235, and Met268, hydrophobic interactions of the alkyl type were formed. With Tyr238, two interactions were established, one of the pi-alkyl type and one of the pi-pi type. With Ala264, an interaction of the same type was formed.
