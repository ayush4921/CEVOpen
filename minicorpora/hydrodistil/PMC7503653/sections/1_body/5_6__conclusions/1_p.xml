<p>The main compounds obtained in the essential oil of 
 <italic>Siparuna guianensis</italic> were Atractylone (18.65%), 
 <italic>trans</italic>-β-Elemenone (11.78%), Germacrene D (7.61%), Curzerene (7.1%), γ-Elemene (7.04%) and, followed by δ-Elemene (5.38%), Germacrone (5.26%), β- Yerangene (4.14%), and β-Cubebene (3.34%). The bacterium most sensitive to the effect of the essential oil was 
 <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> followed by the fungus 
 <italic>Candida albicans.</italic> Both microorganisms had the same MIC value (125 μL / mL). In our results, it is evidenced that atractylon interacts with all catalytic sites of the proteins and may be an inhibitor. The energy contributions observed were the electrostatic interactions energies (ΔE
 <sub>ele</sub>), and of the van der Waals (ΔEvdW), polar (ΔGGB), and nonpolar (ΔGNP) types.
