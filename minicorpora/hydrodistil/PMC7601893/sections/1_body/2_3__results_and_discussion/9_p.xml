<p>PCA was employed in order to evaluate the phenolic compounds quantified by HPLC, total contents of phenolics, flavonoids, and non-flavonoids, as well as the antiradical activity measured by DPPH and ABTS assays (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-09-01433-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Samples were separated along the first principal component (PC1) by differences on the concentrations of rutin, quercitrin, quercetin, luteolin, total content of flavonoids, and phenolic acids (gallic, chlorogenic, caffeic, and ellagic acids). PC1 explained up to 33.73% and PC2 explained up to 23.54% of total variance. Thus, the presented two-dimensional graph was able to explain 57.27% of the variability in the experimental data (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-09-01433-f002">Figure 2</xref>B). Consequently, the first three principal components—i.e., PC1, PC2, and PC3—explained 70.11% of total variance. It is noteworthy that all ethyl acetate fractions from 
 <italic>B. trimera</italic> and 
 <italic>B. myriocephala</italic> obtained at pH 4 were located in the 1st and 2nd quadrants (right side), and the fractions at pH 8 were located in the 3rd and 4th quadrants (left side) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-09-01433-f002">Figure 2</xref>A). Furthermore, the total phenolic content was not affected by the region of collection, analyzed specimens nor the gender, and the chemical compositions were similar between the collected and commercial samples from Paraná and São Paulo states.
