<p>Using a two-way ANOVA and considering gender and location as factors, the isolated effects and the significance of the interaction gender*location were calculated (

 <italic>B. myriocephala</italic> and 
 <italic>B. trimera</italic> samples. According to the results, only the DPPH data and (-)-epicatechin content was significant between locations, whereas there was a significant difference (
