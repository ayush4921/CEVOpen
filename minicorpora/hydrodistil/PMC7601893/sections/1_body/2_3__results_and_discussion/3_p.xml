<p>Our results are in agreement with those reported by Besten et al. [
 <xref rid="B20-foods-09-01433" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], which showed clear similarities between the metabolism of male and female specimens of five different 
 <italic>Baccharis</italic> species. In another study, Besten et al. [
 <xref rid="B32-foods-09-01433" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] verified that there was no significant difference in the chemical composition of 
 <italic>B. trimera</italic> essential oils from Southern Brazil. However, our results suggest that the chemical composition of essential oils from 
 <italic>Baccharis</italic> genus was clearly influenced by the species identified and the geographical region where the plant was collected. Simões-Pires et al. [
 <xref rid="B15-foods-09-01433" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] suggested that carquejyl acetate is a chemomarker for the identification of 
 <italic>B. trimera</italic>, since relative concentrations up to 69% (
 <italic>w/w</italic>) regarding this compound were observed in the essential oil of the mentioned species. Nevertheless, Silva et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-foods-09-01433" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] did not identify this compound in their samples and it was suggested that the variation pattern in the essential oils could be due to the existence of chemotypes for 
 <italic>B. trimera</italic>, that have not been identified and described yet for this species. These behaviors agree with our results, since greater proportions of carquejyl acetate were obtained from 
 <italic>B. trimera</italic> samples collected in Paraná state, whereas minor levels of this compound were found in 
 <italic>B. myriocephala</italic> from São Paulo state. Furthermore, it is known that the chemical composition of essential oils varies according to climatic and geographic conditions [
 <xref rid="B19-foods-09-01433" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Our results are in-line with those reported by Trombin-Souza et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-foods-09-01433" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], which verified that 
 <italic>B. myriocephala</italic> is constituted by minor proportions of carquejyl acetate.
