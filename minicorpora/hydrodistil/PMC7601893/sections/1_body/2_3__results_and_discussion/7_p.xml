<p>DPPH and ABTS scavenging assays are widely employed for the evaluation of the antiradical activity of plant extracts. In our study, it was demonstrated that 
 <italic>B. myriocephala</italic> and 
 <italic>B. trimera</italic> ethyl acetate fractions have antiradical effects by DPPH, which means that the compounds present in the samples exhibited hydrogen donating ability (

 <xref rid="foods-09-01433-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) showed that these fractions exhibited significant quantities of non-flavonoids which are good DPPH scavengers, such as gallic and caffeic acids [

The ABTS assay was also employed for the evaluation of the antiradical activity and, in agreement with DPPH results, fractions were composed by compounds which were good ABTS scavengers. This indicated the electron-donating properties of the compounds present in the fractions. Hence, the obtained results evidence the antiradical activity of the 
 <italic>B. myriocephala</italic> and 
 <italic>B. trimera</italic> fractions, as well as the hydrogen and electron-donating abilities of phenolic compounds, which are related to their chemical structures.
