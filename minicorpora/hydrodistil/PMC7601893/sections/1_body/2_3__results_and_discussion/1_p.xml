 <xref rid="B21-foods-09-01433" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In general, it was observed that the samples with the highest concentrations of oxygenated monoterpenes and oxygenated sesquiterpenes were collected in Paraná (PRMV and PRFV) and São Paulo (SPFV and SPM) states, respectively. Interestingly, the commercial sample PRCoV exhibited higher amounts of oxygenated monoterpenes compared to SPCoV.
