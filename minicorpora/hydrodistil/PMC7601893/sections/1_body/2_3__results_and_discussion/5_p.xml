<p>It is well known that medicinal plants are constituted by different classes of chemical compounds which have different polarities, so the solvent choice displays an important role to separate their constituents. Firstly, chloroform extractions were performed in order to remove the least polar compounds from the aqueous phases. After these extractions, the pH value of the residual medium was changed to 8, followed by extractions with ethyl acetate to favor the extraction of flavonoids. After that, the pH value of the residual aqueous phases was changed to 4, and then new extractions with ethyl acetate were performed in order to extract phenolic acids [

On the other hand, the ethyl acetate fractions exhibited variations on the total content of phenolic and flavonoid compounds. It is well known from the literature that several factors may contribute to changes in the concentrations of secondary metabolites in plants, such as seasonality, temperature, altitude, and collection conditions [
