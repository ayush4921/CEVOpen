 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-09-01433-f004">Figure 4</xref> demonstrates the reducing power results of assays performed with ethyl acetate fractions from male and female specimens of 
 <italic>B. trimera</italic> and 
 <italic>B. myriocephala</italic> from Paraná and São Paulo states. The reducing power is directly associated with the antioxidant activity of a compound, due to the ability to reduce [Fe(CN)

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-09-01433-f004">Figure 4</xref>, all fractions exhibited antioxidant activity and this property was similar between the samples due to the analogous increases in the absorbance values. Just like ABTS
 <sup>+</sup> method, the reducing power assay activity indicates the electron-donating properties of the bioactive compounds present in the ethyl acetate fractions. By these two distinct methods, it was possible to prove the great electron-donating capability of the components present in the ethyl acetate fractions from two 
 <italic>Baccharis</italic> species. The reducing ability of a compound is due to the presence of phenolic hydroxyl groups in its chemical structure, as well as due to the resonance between the free electron pair on the phenolic oxygen and the benzene ring. Compounds with reducing power ability indicate that they are able to react with free radicals stabilizing and blocking radical chain reactions [
