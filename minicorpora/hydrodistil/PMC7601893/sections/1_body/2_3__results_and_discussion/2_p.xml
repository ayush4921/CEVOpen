 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-09-01433-f001">Figure 1</xref> demonstrates the variation in the chemical composition of 
 <italic>B. myriocephala</italic> and 
 <italic>B. trimera</italic> essential oils from male and female specimens and from two commercial samples from Paraná and São Paulo. The similarity of essential oils was evaluated via PCA, which revealed a strong inter-relationship and explained up to 71% of total variance in the chemical composition of essential oils (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-09-01433-f001">Figure 1</xref>). The concentrations of the compounds in the essential oils obtained from leaves collected in the same regions were similar and gender did not have a significant impact on the selected chemical compounds. PRMV and PRFV samples presented carquejyl acetate, palustrol, and carquejol as the major components. On the other hand, the SPFV, SPMV, and SPCoV samples presented spathulenol, followed by caryophyllene oxide and β-caryophyllene as their major constituents. Besides that, it is possible to observe that the volatiles extracted from the commercial sample PRCoV were mainly spathulenol followed by carquejyl acetate and palustrol (
