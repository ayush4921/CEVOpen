<p>The similarities between the ethyl acetate fractions of collected and commercial samples were analyzed using a hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), in which two clusters were identified (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-09-01433-f003">Figure 3</xref>). These clusters corroborated the results from the PCA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-09-01433-f002">Figure 2</xref>A). Cluster 1 contains the ethyl acetate fractions with the highest content of phenolic acids (those obtained at pH 4) and the lowest content of flavonoids. On the other hand, cluster 2 shows the ethyl acetate fractions with the highest content of flavonoids (those obtained at pH 8). It can be observed that the fractions obtained from male and female 
 <italic>Baccharis</italic> specimens were grouped in both clusters 1 and 2. Thus, the results suggested again that there was no significant difference in the chemical composition of ethyl acetate fractions of male and female specimens. Differently, it was verified that the essential oils showed differences in their chemical composition for 
 <italic>B. myriocephala</italic> and 
 <italic>B. trimera</italic> species.
