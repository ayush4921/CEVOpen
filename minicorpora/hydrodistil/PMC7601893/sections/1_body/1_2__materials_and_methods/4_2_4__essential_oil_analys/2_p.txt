0: The relative composition of essential oil was determined on a Shimadzu 14B gas chromatograph with a flame ionization detection system detector (GC-FID) and an OV-5 column (30 m  0.25 mm  0.25 mm).
1: Nitrogen was employed as the carrier gas at a constant pressure of 80 kPa (split ratio: 1/150).
2: An aliquot of 1 L of the oil diluted in ethyl ether was used for injection.
3: The detector and injector temperatures were kept at 300 C and 250 C, respectively.
4: The initial column temperature was 50 C with a heating rate of 5 C min 1 until 270 C, where the temperature was maintained for 8 min.
5: The analysis of each essential oil sample was carried out in triplicate.
