<p>The relative composition of essential oil was determined on a Shimadzu 14B gas chromatograph with a flame ionization detection system detector (GC-FID) and an OV-5 column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 mm). Nitrogen was employed as the carrier gas at a constant pressure of 80 kPa (split ratio: 1/150). An aliquot of 1 µL of the oil diluted in ethyl ether was used for injection. The detector and injector temperatures were kept at 300 °C and 250 °C, respectively. The initial column temperature was 50 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup> until 270 °C, where the temperature was maintained for 8 min. The analysis of each essential oil sample was carried out in triplicate.
