<p>The analysis of 
 <italic>B. trimera</italic> and 
 <italic>B. myriocephala</italic> essential oils was carried out by employing a Varian
 <sup>®</sup> CP-3800 gas chromatograph, equipped with Saturn
 <sup>®</sup> GC-MS Workstation Software v. 5.51. The instrument was operated in El mode at 70 eV with a mass scan range of 40–650 m/z at a sample rate of 1.0 scan s
 <sup>−1</sup>. A capillary column CP-Sil long-8 CB Low Bleed/MS 30 m with a diameter of 0.25 mm and a 0.25 mm film was used. The injector and the interface temperatures were kept at 250 °C and 240 °C, respectively. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 5 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup>. The temperature was set to increase as follows: 50 °C during the first minute, and then 3 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup> up to 240 °C (split ratio: 1/50). The relative retention indexes were determined using different alkanes (C8-C18) analyzed under the same conditions as those used for the essential oil samples. In order to validate the system and ensure the reliability of the calculated retention rates, standards were used for α-pinene, β-pinene, linalool, limonene, spathulenol, caryophyllene, and viridiflorol.
