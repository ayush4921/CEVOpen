0: The analysis of  B. trimera and  B. myriocephala essential oils was carried out by employing a Varian  CP-3800 gas chromatograph, equipped with Saturn  GC-MS Workstation Software v. 5.51.
1: The instrument was operated in El mode at 70 eV with a mass scan range of 40650 m/z at a sample rate of 1.0 scan s 1.
2: A capillary column CP-Sil long-8 CB Low Bleed/MS 30 m with a diameter of 0.25 mm and a 0.25 mm film was used.
3: The injector and the interface temperatures were kept at 250 C and 240 C, respectively.
4: Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 5 mL min 1.
5: The temperature was set to increase as follows: 50 C during the first minute, and then 3 C min 1 up to 240 C (split ratio: 1/50).
6: The relative retention indexes were determined using different alkanes (C8-C18) analyzed under the same conditions as those used for the essential oil samples.
7: In order to validate the system and ensure the reliability of the calculated retention rates, standards were used for -pinene, -pinene, linalool, limonene, spathulenol, caryophyllene, and viridiflorol.
