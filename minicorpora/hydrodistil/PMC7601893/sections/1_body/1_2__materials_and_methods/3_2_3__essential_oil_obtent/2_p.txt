0: The remaining aqueous residues after the hydrodistillation processes were reserved for extractions procedures [ 24].
1: These aqueous residues were partitioned with chloroform (2  250 mL) to obtain the fractions named PRCoCl, SPCoCl, PRMCl, PRFCl, SPMCl, and SPFCl.
2: Then, the pH value of the aqueous phases was adjusted (pH 8) using 2 mol L 1 NaOH, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate (2  250 mL) to obtain the fractions PRCo8, SPCo8, PRM8, PRF8, SPM8, and SPF8.
3: Afterwards, the remaining aqueous phases were acidified with concentrated HCl (pH 4) and extracted with ethyl acetate (2  250 mL) to obtain the fractions named PRCo4, SPCo4, PRM4, PRF4, SPM4, and SPF4.
4: All organic phases were dried with anhydrous Na 2SO 4, filtered, and the solvents were removed under vacuum using a rotary evaporator.
