0: The antiradical activity for each sample was measured as a decrease in the absorbance of DPPH/ABTS radicals and were calculated using Equation (1): % inhibition = 100  [(Abs  sample  Abs  blank)  100/Abs  control]  (1) where Abs sample is the absorbance of radicals in the presence of the sample; Abs blank is the absorbance of the samples without adding radicals; and Abs control is the absorbance of pure radical solutions.
1: IC 50 (inhibitory concentration) values were calculated from % inhibition for each fraction.
