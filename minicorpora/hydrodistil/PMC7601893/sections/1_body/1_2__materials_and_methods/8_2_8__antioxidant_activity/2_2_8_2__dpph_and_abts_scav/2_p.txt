0: The ABTS scavenging capacity of each fraction was assessed according to the method described by Pellegrini et al.
1: [ 30], which employed ascorbic acid as a positive control.
2: The ABTS radical cation was obtained by reacting ABTS solution with 140 mmol L 1 K 2S 2O 7, followed by incubation in the dark for 1216 h before use.
3: For the analysis, the fractions (1100 g mL 1) were mixed with 10 mmol L 1 phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and 7 mmol L 1 ABTS + solutions.
4: The obtained mixtures were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the dark.
5: The absorbance values were measured at 734 nm in a microplate reader.
