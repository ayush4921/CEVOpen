0: The DPPH scavenging capability of each fraction was assessed by using the method described by Brand-Williams et al.
1: [ 29], employing ascorbic acid as a positive control.
2: The fractions (1100 g mL 1) were mixed with 120 mol L 1 DPPH ethanolic solution and the mixtures were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the dark.
3: The absorbance values were measured at 518 nm in a microplate reader.
