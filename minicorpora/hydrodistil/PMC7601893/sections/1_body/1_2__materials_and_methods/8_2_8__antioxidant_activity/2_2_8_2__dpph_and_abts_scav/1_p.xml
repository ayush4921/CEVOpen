<p>The DPPH scavenging capability of each fraction was assessed by using the method described by Brand-Williams et al. [
 <xref rid="B29-foods-09-01433" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], employing ascorbic acid as a positive control. The fractions (1–100 µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) were mixed with 120 µmol L
 <sup>−1</sup> DPPH ethanolic solution and the mixtures were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. The absorbance values were measured at 518 nm in a microplate reader.
