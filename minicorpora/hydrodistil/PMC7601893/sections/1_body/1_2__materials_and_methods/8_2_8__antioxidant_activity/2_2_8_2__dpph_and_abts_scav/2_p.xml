<p>The ABTS scavenging capacity of each fraction was assessed according to the method described by Pellegrini et al. [
 <xref rid="B30-foods-09-01433" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], which employed ascorbic acid as a positive control. The ABTS radical cation was obtained by reacting ABTS solution with 140 mmol L
 <sup>−1</sup> K
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub>, followed by incubation in the dark for 12–16 h before use. For the analysis, the fractions (1–100 µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) were mixed with 10 mmol L
 <sup>−1</sup> phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and 7 mmol L
 <sup>−1</sup> ABTS
 <sup>+</sup> solutions. The obtained mixtures were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. The absorbance values were measured at 734 nm in a microplate reader.
