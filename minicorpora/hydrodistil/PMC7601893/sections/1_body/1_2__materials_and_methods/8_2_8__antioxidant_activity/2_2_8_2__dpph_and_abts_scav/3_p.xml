<p>The antiradical activity for each sample was measured as a decrease in the absorbance of DPPH/ABTS radicals and were calculated using Equation (1):
 <disp-formula>% inhibition = 100 − [(Abs
  <sub>sample</sub> − Abs
  <sub>blank</sub>) × 100/Abs
  <sub>control</sub>]
  <label>(1)</label>
 </disp-formula> where Abs
 <sub>sample</sub> is the absorbance of radicals in the presence of the sample; Abs
 <sub>blank</sub> is the absorbance of the samples without adding radicals; and Abs
 <sub>control</sub> is the absorbance of pure radical solutions. IC
 <sub>50</sub> (inhibitory concentration) values were calculated from % inhibition for each fraction.
