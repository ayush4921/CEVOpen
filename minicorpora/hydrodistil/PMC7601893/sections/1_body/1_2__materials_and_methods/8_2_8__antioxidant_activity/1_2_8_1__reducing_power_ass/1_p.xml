<p>The reducing power capacity of ethyl acetate fractions from 
 <italic>B. myriocephala</italic> and 
 <italic>B. trimera</italic> was evaluated according to the method reported by Mathew and Abraham [
 <xref rid="B28-foods-09-01433" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The reaction was performed in 0.2 mol L
 <sup>−1</sup> phosphate buffer (pH 6.6), 1% (
 <italic>w/v</italic>) K
 <sub>3</sub>[Fe(CN)
 <sub>6</sub>], and the fractions (1–100 µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) to give a final volume of 148 µL. The obtained mixtures were incubated at 50 °C for 20 min and 10% (
 <italic>w/v</italic>) TCA (86 µL) was added. The tubes were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min and 86 µL of the upper layer solution was mixed with distilled water (86 µL). Finally, 28 µL of 0.1% (
 <italic>w/v</italic>) FeCl
 <sub>3</sub> was added and the absorbance value was measured at 700 nm in spectrophotometer. Ascorbic acid was used as a positive control.
