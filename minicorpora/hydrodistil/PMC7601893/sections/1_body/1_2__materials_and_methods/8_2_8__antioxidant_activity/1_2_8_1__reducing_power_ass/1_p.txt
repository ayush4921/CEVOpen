0: The reducing power capacity of ethyl acetate fractions from  B. myriocephala and  B. trimera was evaluated according to the method reported by Mathew and Abraham [ 28].
1: The reaction was performed in 0.2 mol L 1 phosphate buffer (pH 6.6), 1% ( w/v) K 3[Fe(CN) 6], and the fractions (1100 g mL 1) to give a final volume of 148 L. The obtained mixtures were incubated at 50 C for 20 min and 10% ( w/v) TCA (86 L) was added.
2: The tubes were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min and 86 L of the upper layer solution was mixed with distilled water (86 L).
3: Finally, 28 L of 0.1% ( w/v) FeCl 3 was added and the absorbance value was measured at 700 nm in spectrophotometer.
4: Ascorbic acid was used as a positive control.
