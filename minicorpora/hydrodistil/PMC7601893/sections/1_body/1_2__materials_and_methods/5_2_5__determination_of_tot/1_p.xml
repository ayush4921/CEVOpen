<p>The total phenolic content was measured as described by Singleton et al. [
 <xref rid="B25-foods-09-01433" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Five microliters of each fraction were mixed with 10% (
 <italic>v/v</italic>) FCR (100 µL) and 7.5% (
 <italic>w/v</italic>) Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> aqueous solution (125 µL). After an incubation for 15 min at 45 °C the absorbance value was measured at 765 nm in a microplate reader. An analytical curve of gallic acid standard was constructed for the determination of total phenolic content for each fraction. The results were expressed as mg of gallic acid equivalent (GAE) g
 <sup>−1</sup> f fraction.
