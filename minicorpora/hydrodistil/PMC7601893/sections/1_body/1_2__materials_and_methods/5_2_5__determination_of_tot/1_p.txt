0: The total phenolic content was measured as described by Singleton et al.
1: [ 25].
2: Five microliters of each fraction were mixed with 10% ( v/v) FCR (100 L) and 7.5% ( w/v) Na 2CO 3 aqueous solution (125 L).
3: After an incubation for 15 min at 45 C the absorbance value was measured at 765 nm in a microplate reader.
4: An analytical curve of gallic acid standard was constructed for the determination of total phenolic content for each fraction.
5: The results were expressed as mg of gallic acid equivalent (GAE) g 1 f fraction.
