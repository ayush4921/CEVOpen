0: Total flavonoid content was measured as described by Kosalec et al.
1: [ 26] by complexation with Al(III) ions.
2: Five microliters of each fraction were mixed with 10% ( w/v) AlCl 3 (4 L) and CH 3COOK 0.1 mmol L 1 (4 L) aqueous solutions and methanol to give a final volume of 225 L. The absorbance value was measured at 420 nm by using a microplate reader.
3: An analytical curve of quercetin standard was constructed for the determination of total flavonoid content for each fraction.
4: The results were expressed as mg of quercetin equivalent (QE) g 1 of fraction.
