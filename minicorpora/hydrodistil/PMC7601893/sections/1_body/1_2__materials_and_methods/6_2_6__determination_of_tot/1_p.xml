<p>Total flavonoid content was measured as described by Kosalec et al. [
 <xref rid="B26-foods-09-01433" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] by complexation with Al(III) ions. Five microliters of each fraction were mixed with 10% (

 <sub>3</sub> (4 µL) and CH
 <sub>3</sub>COOK 0.1 mmol L
 <sup>−1</sup> (4 µL) aqueous solutions and methanol to give a final volume of 225 µL. The absorbance value was measured at 420 nm by using a microplate reader. An analytical curve of quercetin standard was constructed for the determination of total flavonoid content for each fraction. The results were expressed as mg of quercetin equivalent (QE) g
 <sup>−1</sup> of fraction.
