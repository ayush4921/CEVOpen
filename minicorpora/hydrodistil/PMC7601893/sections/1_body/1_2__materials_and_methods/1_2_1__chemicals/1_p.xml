<p>All solvents and chemicals used in this study were of analytical grade. Folin–Ciocalteu’s phenol reagent (FCR), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), quercetin (QER), quercitrin, rutin, kaempferol, ascorbic acid (AA), luteolin, catechin, epicatechin, and potassium hexacyanoferrate(III) K
 <sub>3</sub>[Fe(CN)
 <sub>6</sub>] were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co (St. Louis, MO, USA). Acetonitrile, methanol, phosphoric acid, gallic acid (GA), chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, and ellagic acid were acquired from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Trichloroacetic acid (TCA), sodium sulphate (Na
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>), potassium persulfate (K

 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>8</sub>), ferric chloride (FeCl
 <sub>3</sub>), sodium carbonate (Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub>), potassium acetate (CH
 <sub>3</sub>COOK), and aluminum chloride (AlCl
 <sub>3</sub>) were obtained from Vetec (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). Deionized water was used to prepare all aqueous solutions.
