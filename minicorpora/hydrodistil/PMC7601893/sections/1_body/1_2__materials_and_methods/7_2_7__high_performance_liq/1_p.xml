<p>The ethyl acetate fractions of 
 <italic>B. myriocephala</italic> and 
 <italic>B. trimera</italic> were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography, as described by Boligon et al. [
 <xref rid="B27-foods-09-01433" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] with slight modifications. Analyses were carried out by using a Shimadzu
 <sup>®</sup> Prominence Auto Sampler (SIL-20A) HPLC system (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan), equipped with Shimadzu
 <sup>®</sup> LC-20AT reciprocating pumps connected to a DGU 20A5 degasser with a CBM 20A integrator and SPD-M20A diode array detector. A LC solution 1.22 SP1 software was used for data processing. Reverse phase chromatographic analyses were performed under gradient conditions using a Phenomenex C18 column (4.6 mm × 150 mm) filled with 5 μm diameter particles. The mobile phase consisted of a combination of solvent A (methanol: water; 9:1; 
 <italic>v/v</italic>) adjusted to pH 2.0 with phosphoric acid and solvent B (acetonitrile: water: methanol; 60:20:20; 
 <italic>v/v/v</italic>). Next, 40 mL of each sample were separately injected into the chromatograph at a flow rate of 0.6 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup> and the analyses were performed following a linear solvent gradient: 0 min, 100% A; 10 min 30% A; 20 min, 40% A; 50 min, 0% A; held at 0% A for 15 min. The system was equilibrated for five minutes with 100% A before and after each injection. Prior to chromatography analysis 
 <italic>B. myriocephala</italic> and 
 <italic>B. trimera</italic> ethyl acetate fractions (10 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) and mobile phase were filtered through 0.45 μm membrane filter (Millipore
 <sup>®</sup>), and degassed in an ultrasonic bath. The stock solutions of polyphenols standards (gallic acid, catechin, epicatechin, ellagic acid, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, quercitrin, quercetin, luteolin, kaempferol, and rutin) were prepared in the mobile phase with concentrations ranging from 0.020 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> to 0.500 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>. The quantification of these components was performed by integrating the peaks using the external standard method at 257 nm for gallic acid, 280 nm for catechin/epicatechin, 325 nm for ellagic, chlorogenic/caffeic acids, and 365 for quercetin, quercitrin, rutin, kaempferol, and luteolin. The retention times and DAD spectra (200–600 nm) of standards were compared to the results obtained for the studied fractions in order to confirm the observed chromatographic peaks.
