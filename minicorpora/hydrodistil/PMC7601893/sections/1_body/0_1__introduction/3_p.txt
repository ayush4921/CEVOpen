0: Oxidative stress has been considered one of the main reasons for the progression of several chronic diseases in humans.
1: The high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) might provoke oxidation of proteins and lipids, leading to biological disorders [ 12].
2: In recent years, several studies have proved that extracts from  Baccharis genus exhibit remarkable antioxidant activity [ 7, 13, 14].
3: For instance, Paiva et al.
4: [ 13] showed that the hydroalcoholic extract from  B. trimera leaves can improve the oxidative stress resistance by increasing survival rate and by reducing ROS levels under oxidative stress conditions in vivo.
5: In another work, Padua et al.
6: [ 14] observed that this same extract could reduce the release of ROS in neutrophils by using both in vitro and in vivo models.
7: In addition, De Oliveira et al.
8: [ 7] found that the ethyl acetate extract from  B. trimera showed the highest antioxidant activity comparing to aqueous and dichloromethane extracts and also suggested that the anti-inflammatory activity exhibited by the plant was mainly due to the presence of phenolic compounds.
