<p>Oxidative stress has been considered one of the main reasons for the progression of several chronic diseases in humans. The high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) might provoke oxidation of proteins and lipids, leading to biological disorders [

 <italic>Baccharis</italic> genus exhibit remarkable antioxidant activity [

 <xref rid="B14-foods-09-01433" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. For instance, Paiva et al. [
 <xref rid="B13-foods-09-01433" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] showed that the hydroalcoholic extract from 
 <italic>B. trimera</italic> leaves can improve the oxidative stress resistance by increasing survival rate and by reducing ROS levels under oxidative stress conditions in vivo. In another work, PÃ¡dua et al. [
 <xref rid="B14-foods-09-01433" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] observed that this same extract could reduce the release of ROS in neutrophils by using both in vitro and in vivo models. In addition, De Oliveira et al. [
 <xref rid="B7-foods-09-01433" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] found that the ethyl acetate extract from 
 <italic>B. trimera</italic> showed the highest antioxidant activity comparing to aqueous and dichloromethane extracts and also suggested that the anti-inflammatory activity exhibited by the plant was mainly due to the presence of phenolic compounds.
