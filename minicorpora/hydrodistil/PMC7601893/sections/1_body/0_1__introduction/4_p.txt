0: The chemical composition of  Baccharis genus essential oils is characterized by the predominance of carquejol, carquejil acetate, and sesquiterpenes [ 15].
1: However, some researchers found that spathulenol and limonene are the most abundant compounds [ 16, 17].
2: The differences between these studies can be attributed to the geographical location and environmental factors, which have an influence on the chemical composition of  Baccharis essential oils [ 18, 19].
3: Interestingly, some studies have also shown differences in the chemical composition of oils from male and female specimens of  Baccharis.
4: Some authors have assumed that these species are dioecious and require more attention since gender can influence its biological properties [ 6, 18, 20, 21].
5: For example, the female specimen allocates more energy and nutrients to reproduction than male plants.
6: In this way, the female plant has reduced growth, low nutritional status, and are less attacked by herbivorous insects than male plants [ 21, 22].
7: This behavior is due to the fact that female species tend to grow slowly when compared to male, which favors the increasing defense against pathogens [ 21, 22].
