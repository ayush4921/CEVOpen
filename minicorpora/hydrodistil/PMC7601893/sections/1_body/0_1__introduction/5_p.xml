<p>Considering the usage of 
 <italic>Baccharis</italic> specimens in folk medicine and the fact that the chemical composition of the plant is influenced by species-specific, environmental, and geographical conditions, the aim of this work was to evaluate the possible differences in the chemical composition and antiradical activity of both male and female specimens of 
 <italic>B. myriocephala</italic> and 
 <italic>B. trimera</italic> from distinct Brazilian regions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report regarding the investigation of the influence of gender and geographical origin in the antiradical activity of ethyl acetate fractions (acidic and basic) from the 
 <italic>Baccharis</italic> species.
