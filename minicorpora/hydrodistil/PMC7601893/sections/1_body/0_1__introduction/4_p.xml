<p>The chemical composition of 
 <italic>Baccharis</italic> genus essential oils is characterized by the predominance of carquejol, carquejil acetate, and sesquiterpenes [

 <xref rid="B17-foods-09-01433" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The differences between these studies can be attributed to the geographical location and environmental factors, which have an influence on the chemical composition of

 <xref rid="B19-foods-09-01433" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Interestingly, some studies have also shown differences in the chemical composition of oils from male and female specimens of 
 <italic>Baccharis</italic>. Some authors have assumed that these species are dioecious and require more attention since gender can influence its biological properties [

 <xref rid="B21-foods-09-01433" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. For example, the female specimen allocates more energy and nutrients to reproduction than male plants. In this way, the female plant has reduced growth, low nutritional status, and are less attacked by herbivorous insects than male plants [
