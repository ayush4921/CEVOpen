<p>In the present study, we demonstrated that the chemical composition of essential oils of 
 <italic>B. trimera</italic> and 
 <italic>B. myriocephala</italic> from two different regions of Brazil were similar between genders, but significantly differed regarding species identity. On the other hand, these two parameters did not appear to influence the total content of polyphenols and antiradical activity of ethyl acetate fractions obtained in acidic and basic conditions. Our work demonstrated that these fractions were rich in polyphenols, which justified their antioxidant activity. However, in vivo studies should be done to verify the safety of these plantsâ€™ fractions.
