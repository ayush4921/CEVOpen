  <p>Reducing power assay of ethyl acetate fractions of (
   <bold>A</bold>) 
   <italic>B. trimera</italic> and (
   <bold>B</bold>) 
   <italic>B. myriocephala</italic> and (
   <bold>C</bold>) commercial samples from Paraná and São Paulo states. The data show mean ± standard deviation (SD) values as an average of 3 independent experiments performed in duplicate. Co = commercial samples, F = female specimens, M = male specimens SP = São Paulo state and PR = Paraná state. The presented numbers are related to the pH conditions used to obtain each fraction.
