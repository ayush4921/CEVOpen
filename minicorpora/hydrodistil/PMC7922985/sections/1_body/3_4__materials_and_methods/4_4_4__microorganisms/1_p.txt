0: In this study, as test organisms the following microorganism were used:  Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213,  Escherichia coli ATCC 25922,  Aspergillus fumigatus SC 6359,  A. flavus CBS 120264,  Trichophyton rubrum ATCC 28188,  T. mentagrophytes ATCC 9533,  Candida albicans CBS 2730, and  C. parapsilosis CBS 8836.
1: The bacteria strains were maintained on nutrient agar (Liofilchem, Italy), fungi and yeasts on Sabouraud dextrose agar (Liofilchem, Italy) slants and stored at 4 C. Bacterial inoculum was obtained from cultures incubated at 37 C for 24 h on nutrient agar and diluted according to the 0.5 McFarland standards to approximately 10 8 CFU/mL.
2: Suspensions of fungal spores were prepared from fresh mature (3- to 7-day-old) cultures that grew at 30 C on a Sabouraud dextrose agar.
3: Spores were rinsed with sterile water with 0.05% Tween 80 to determine turbidity spectrophotometrically at 530 nm, according to the conidial size of the species (0.09 to 0.3 optical densities) [ 70].
4: Candida yeasts were grown on Sabouraud dextrose agar at 30 C for 48 h. The yeasts were collected and adjusted to 10 6 CFU/mL (corresponding to an OD 530 nm = 0.120.15) [ 71].
