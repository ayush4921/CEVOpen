0: To estimate -TA occurrence in  T. pulegioides, there were investigated 131 different habitats of this species in Lithuania ( Figure 2,  Table S1).
1: The aerial parts of  T. pulegioides have been separately collected from each habitat in July (during the full flowering stage) in the following way: same selected mass of aerial part of  T. pulegioides was cut from each individual plant growing in the habitat and mixed.
2: The weight was selected depending on each habitat abundance and/or size of individual plants in the habitat: 10 g of aerial part from each individual plant of  T. pulegioides was cut in abundant/big habitats, but only 3050 g was cut in small habitats.
3: The aerial parts of plants were dried at room temperature over 45 days.
