0: In many European countries phenolic chemotypes thymol and carvacrol were found in  T. pulegioides [ 30, 31, 32].
1: However, there is still not enough research has been done about the occurrence of -TA chemotype in  T. pulegioides.
2: A. Michet with co-authors demonstrated that -TA was dominant compound in essential oils of  T. pulegioides, which is growing wild in subalpine zone at 1700 m in France; interestingly, it was observed that -TA chemotype was not growing in habitats where phenolic chemotypes were growing [ 29].
3: D. Mockute and G. Bernotiene found -TA chemotype in  T. pulegioides in Vilnius region of Lithuania [ 27].
4: Investigations in the east and south-east of Lithuania showed that only 39% of -TA was found in natural habitats of  T. pulegioides, and it was demonstrated that mobile phosphorus in soil was showing positive effect on content of -TA in  T. pulegioides [ 28].
5: In western Lithuania, marine climate is more dominant while in the eastern part, the continental climate is more apparent [ 33].
6: Therefore, different climatic conditions in Lithuania could influence -TA occurrence in  T. pulegioides.
