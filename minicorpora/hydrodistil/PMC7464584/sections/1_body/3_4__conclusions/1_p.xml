<p>The chemical composition of 
 <italic>A. ochroleuca</italic> EO was characterized with highly oxygenated constituents (79.01%), including mono-, sesqui-, di-terpenoids, carotenoids, and hydrocarbons. The 
 <italic>trans</italic>-chrysanthenyl acetate, 
 <italic>Î³</italic>-cadinene, oleic acid, methyl ester, patchouli alcohol, and terpinene-4-ol were determined as the main compounds. The 
 <italic>A. ochroleuca</italic> EO exhibited significant phytotoxic activity. The high oxygenation of the EOs constituents was deduced to be correlated with the increase of the phytotoxicity. Therefore, the substantial phytotoxicity of 
 <italic>A. ochroleuca</italic> EO could be ascribed to its high content of the oxygenated compounds (78.28%), and thereby it could be used as an eco-friendly bioherbicide. However, further study is recommended for characterization of the main identified compounds, either singular or in combination at field scale level, as well as for the evaluation of their modes of action and biosafety.
