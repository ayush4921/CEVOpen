0: Up to our knowledge, there are no studies concerning the chemical constituents of  A. ochroleuca EO.
1: We hypothesized that  A. ochroleuca is a weed, but it may contain phytotoxic constituents such as EOs that could be used as bioherbicides against other weeds; thus, if EO of  A. ochroleuca has potent herbicidal activity, it could be a possible way to integrate this oil as bioherbicide and make use of this plant.
2: Therefore, the present work provided for the first time (i) the chemical profile of EO of  A. ochroleuca as well as (ii) the potential phytotoxic activity of this EO against the test plant  Lactuca sativa L. and the noxious weed  Peganum harmala L.
