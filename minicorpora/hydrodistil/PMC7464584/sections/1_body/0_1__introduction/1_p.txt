0: Plants are promising natural resources for essential oils (EOs) with a complex mixture of secondary metabolites, including mono-, sesqui-, and di-terpenoids, in addition to hydrocarbons [ 1, 2].
1: The chemical compounds of EOs were biosynthesized via the different isoprenoid pathways [ 3].
2: The EOs have been described as potent biological agents such as phytotoxic [ 4, 5, 6, 7], antimicrobial [ 8], anti-inflammatory, antipyretic [ 9], antiulcer [ 10], and hepatoprotective [ 11].
3: The bioactivities of EOs are directly correlated and associated with their chemical constituents [ 5].
4: Additionally, EOs can be used widely in several industries as controlling agents for various harmful microorganisms that cause post-harvest diseases, like phytopathogenic and food-borne organisms [ 12].
