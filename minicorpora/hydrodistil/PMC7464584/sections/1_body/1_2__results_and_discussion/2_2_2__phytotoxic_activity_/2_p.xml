<p>At the highest concentration of the EO (250 µL L
 <sup>−1</sup>), the seed germination, shoot growth, and root growth of the 
 <italic>L. sativa</italic> seedling were reduced by 88.6, 86.9, and 97.0%, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00998-f005">Figure 5</xref>a). According to IC
 <sub>50</sub> values, the root was the most inhibited with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 92.1 µL L
 <sup>−1</sup> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00998-f005">Figure 5</xref>b), followed by germination (128.6 µL L
 <sup>−1</sup>) and finally the shoot (131.6 µL L
 <sup>−1</sup>). On the other hand, the EO of 
 <italic>A. ochroleuca</italic> at the lowest concentrations (50, 100, and 150 µL L
 <sup>−1</sup>) revealed significant phytotoxic activity against the germination, shoot growth, and root growth of the noxious weed 
 <italic>P. harmala</italic>, while at the highest concentrations (200 and 250 µL L
 <sup>−1</sup>) it revealed a sharp increase in the phytotoxicity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00998-f006">Figure 6</xref>). Based on the IC
 <sub>50</sub>, the root of 
 <italic>P. harmala</italic> showed the lowest value (134.8 µL L
 <sup>−1</sup>), while the seed germination and shoot growth attained IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 145.7 and 147.9 µL L
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively (
