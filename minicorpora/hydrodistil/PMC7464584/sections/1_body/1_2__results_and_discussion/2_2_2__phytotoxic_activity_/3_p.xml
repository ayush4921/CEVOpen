<p>It is clear that the roots of both 
 <italic>L. sativa</italic> and 
 <italic>P. harmala</italic> seedling were more affected with the EO than shoots, and this could be attributed to the direct contact with the EO as well as the permeability of the root membrane [

 <xref rid="B42-plants-09-00998" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In the present study, the potent phytotoxic activity of the 
 <italic>A. ochroleuca</italic> EO could be ascribed to the presence of high oxygenated compounds, particularly the major compounds such as 
 <italic>trans</italic>-chrysanthenyl acetate, 
 <italic>γ</italic>-cadinene, oleic acid-methyl ester, patchouli alcohol, and terpinene-4-ol. The oxygenated compounds of the EOs were reported to have stronger biological activities than non-oxygenated ones [

 <xref rid="B2-plants-09-00998" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,

 <xref rid="B44-plants-09-00998" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The bicyclic sesquiterpene 
 <italic>γ</italic>-cadinene was reported to have larvicidal activity against malaria, dengue, and filariasis mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="B45-plants-09-00998" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], and it is also reported to have antimicrobial activity [
 <xref rid="B46-plants-09-00998" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In addition, the EO of 
 <italic>Annona salzmannii</italic> showed potent trypanocidal and antitumor activities due to its high content of 
 <italic>γ</italic>-cadinene [
 <xref rid="B47-plants-09-00998" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The fatty acid methyl esters have been reported to possess larvicidal activity [
 <xref rid="B48-plants-09-00998" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] and antibacterial activity [
 <xref rid="B49-plants-09-00998" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].
