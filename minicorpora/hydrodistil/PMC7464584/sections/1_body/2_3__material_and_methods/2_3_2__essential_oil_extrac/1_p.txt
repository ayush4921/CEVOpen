0: The EOs were extracted by hydrodistillation from two samples of  A. ochroleuca above-ground parts via a Clevenger-type apparatus for three hours.
1: The oil layer was collected, and water was removed by 0.5 g of anhydrous Na 2SO 4; they were stored in a dark glass vial at 4 C till further analysis.
2: The yields of the extracted EOs were calculated via the equation 100 ( V/ W), where  V: volume of extracted EO, and  W: weight of the plant material used in extraction.
3: The chemical composition of the EO samples was analyzed and identified separately by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) as described in our previously documented work [ 2, 4].
