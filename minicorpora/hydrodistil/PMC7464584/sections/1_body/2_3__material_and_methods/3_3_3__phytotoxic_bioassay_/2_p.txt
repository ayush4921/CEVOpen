0: To assess the phytotoxicity of the EO, various concentrations (50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 L L 1) were prepared by dilution using 1% Tween  80 (Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) as an emulsifying agent.
1: In Petri plates, 20 sterilized seeds of either  L. sativa or  P. harmala were spread on sterilized filter paper (Whatman No.
2: 1), 4 mL of each concentration or control (Tween  80) was poured, and the plates were sealed with Parafilm  tape (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA).
3: Five plates were prepared per each concentration, and the experiment was repeated three times.
4: A total of 180 plates (2 plants  6 treatments [5 concentrations + control]  5 plates as replications  3 times) were prepared and incubated in a growth chamber at 25 C with adjusted light conditions of 16 h/8 h light/dark cycle.
5: After 5 days of incubation for  L. sativa and 7 days for  P. harmala, the reduction in seed germination, shoot growth, and root growth of the seedlings were calculated based on the following equation: (1)Inhibition (%)=100(Ncontrol/LcontrolNtreatment/Ltreatment)Ntreatment/Lcontrol where  N is the number of germinated seeds and  L is the length of seedling root or shoot.
