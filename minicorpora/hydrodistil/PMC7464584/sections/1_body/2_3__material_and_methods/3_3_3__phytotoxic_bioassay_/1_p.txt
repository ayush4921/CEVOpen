0: The phytotoxicity of the  A. ochroleuca EO was performed against  L. sativa L. as a standard test plant, where it is known to be very sensitive to allelochemicals [ 64] as well as the noxious weed  P. harmala.
1: In brief, the seeds of lettuce were purchased from the Agriculture Research Center, Cairo, Egypt, while the seeds of  P. harmala were collected from Taif, southeast Saudi Arabia.
2: Seeds with uniform size and color were carefully chosen and surface-sterilized via sodium hypochlorite (0.3%).
3: Prior to the experiment, the viability of the seed was performed by the germination of seeds in the Petri plate lined with a filter paper (Whatman No.
4: 1) using distilled water at 25 C with adjusted light conditions of 16/8 h light/dark cycle.
5: The germination percentage was 97.23  0.5% for  L. sativa and 90.12  1.02% for  P. harmala.
