<p>Nutmeg essential oil preparations with aluminometasilicate have stronger anti-inflammatory activity in Poly I:C-affected fibrolast cell culture. The oil with the excipient has a higher degree of cytoprotection from Poly I:C-induced necrosis, and both the oil and hydrolats with excipient more efficiently prevent IL-6 release compared to the preparations without aluminometasilicate.</p>
