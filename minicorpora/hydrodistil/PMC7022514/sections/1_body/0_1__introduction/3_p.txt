0: Hydrodistillation is a popular method used for the preparation of essential oils.
1: However, hydrodistillation with excipients is not widely usedwe have found just three studies applying this method so far [ 19, 20, 21].
2: Therefore, we have applied magnesium aluminometasilicate in hydrodistillation as the new excipient and have tested its effects on the nutmeg essential oil yield and its composition [ 22].
3: Aluminometasilicate is widely used as a disintegrator in the manufacturing of tablets.
4: Furthermore, this compound is non-toxic and inexpensive, as the price is ~300 eur for 25 kg.
5: Magnesium aluminometasilicate has significantly increased both the yield and composition of some chemical compounds (sabinene, -pinene, and limonene).
6: The use of the excipient also increased the essential oil yield by about 61% (hydrodistillation with waterthe yield is 0.79  0.04 g, using 1% excipient1.29  0.05 g; the nutmeg quantity was 15 g, the water content was 300 mL) [ 22].
