<p>Since ancient times, 
 <italic>Myristica fragrans</italic> (nutmeg) seeds have been used as a food spice, flavoring agent, a natural remedy for headaches and fever [
 <xref rid="B1-foods-09-00037" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Nutmeg seeds have essential and fatty oils, resins, wax, and other components [
 <xref rid="B2-foods-09-00037" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Nutmeg’s essential oil has antimicrobial, antiseptic, antiparasitic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties [

 <xref rid="B3-foods-09-00037" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The concentration of essential oil in nutmeg seeds is about 5–15% [
 <xref rid="B4-foods-09-00037" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and its major components are terpene hydrocarbons (sabinene, pinene, camphene, 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene, phellandrene, terpinene, limonene, and myrcene altogether make up 60% to 80% of the oil), oxygenated terpenes (linalool, geraniol, and terpineol, which make up approximately 5% to 15%) and aromatic ethers (myristicin, elemicin, safrole, eugenol, and eugenol derivatives, together constituting 15 to 20%) [

 <xref rid="B8-foods-09-00037" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The toxicity of nutmeg seeds at high doses has been reported, mainly due to myristicin oil and elemicin, causing tachycardia, nausea, vomiting, agitation, and hallucinations. However, these effects are related to the abuse of the spice and are not observed at usual low concentrations [
 <xref rid="B9-foods-09-00037" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. There are many studies on the beneficial effects of nutmeg seed and various nutmeg seed extracts. One of the most prominent biological activities of the nutmeg preparations is antibacterial. Nutmeg seed lignans exert antimicrobial activity on 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Shigella dysenteriae</italic> [
 <xref rid="B10-foods-09-00037" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Ethanol and acetone extracts of nutmeg crust have strong antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B5-foods-09-00037" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Ethyl acetate extracts of flesh of the nutmeg fruit have inhibitory potential against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ranging from 0.625 to 1.25 mg/mL [
 <xref rid="B11-foods-09-00037" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Used for the preservation of sweets, nutmeg methanol extracts inhibit growth of 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic>, 
 <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> at MIC between 250 and 300 mg/mL [
 <xref rid="B12-foods-09-00037" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, there are only a few studies on the biological activity of nutmeg essential oil. Takikawa et al. showed a higher antibacterial effect of essential nutmeg oil on pathogenic compared to non-pathogenic strains of 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> [
 <xref rid="B13-foods-09-00037" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Furthermore, nutmeg essential oil decreased the growth and survival of 
 <italic>Yersinia enterocolitica</italic> and 
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> in broth culture [
