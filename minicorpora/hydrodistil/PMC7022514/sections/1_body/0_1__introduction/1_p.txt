0: Since ancient times,  Myristica fragrans (nutmeg) seeds have been used as a food spice, flavoring agent, a natural remedy for headaches and fever [ 1].
1: Nutmeg seeds have essential and fatty oils, resins, wax, and other components [ 2].
2: Nutmegs essential oil has antimicrobial, antiseptic, antiparasitic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties [ 1, 3].
3: The concentration of essential oil in nutmeg seeds is about 515% [ 4], and its major components are terpene hydrocarbons (sabinene, pinene, camphene,  p-cymene, phellandrene, terpinene, limonene, and myrcene altogether make up 60% to 80% of the oil), oxygenated terpenes (linalool, geraniol, and terpineol, which make up approximately 5% to 15%) and aromatic ethers (myristicin, elemicin, safrole, eugenol, and eugenol derivatives, together constituting 15 to 20%) [ 5, 6, 7, 8].
4: The toxicity of nutmeg seeds at high doses has been reported, mainly due to myristicin oil and elemicin, causing tachycardia, nausea, vomiting, agitation, and hallucinations.
5: However, these effects are related to the abuse of the spice and are not observed at usual low concentrations [ 9].
6: There are many studies on the beneficial effects of nutmeg seed and various nutmeg seed extracts.
7: One of the most prominent biological activities of the nutmeg preparations is antibacterial.
8: Nutmeg seed lignans exert antimicrobial activity on  Bacillus subtilis,  Staphylococcus aureus, and  Shigella dysenteriae [ 10].
9: Ethanol and acetone extracts of nutmeg crust have strong antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria  Staphylococcus aureus [ 5].
10: Ethyl acetate extracts of flesh of the nutmeg fruit have inhibitory potential against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ranging from 0.625 to 1.25 mg/mL [ 11].
11: Used for the preservation of sweets, nutmeg methanol extracts inhibit growth of  Staphylococcus aureus,  Aspergillus niger,  Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and  Escherichia coli at MIC between 250 and 300 mg/mL [ 12].
12: However, there are only a few studies on the biological activity of nutmeg essential oil.
13: Takikawa et al.
14: showed a higher antibacterial effect of essential nutmeg oil on pathogenic compared to non-pathogenic strains of  Escherichia coli [ 13].
15: Furthermore, nutmeg essential oil decreased the growth and survival of  Yersinia enterocolitica and  Listeria monocytogenes in broth culture [ 14].
