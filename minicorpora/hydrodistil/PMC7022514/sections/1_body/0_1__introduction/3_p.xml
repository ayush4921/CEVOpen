<p>Hydrodistillation is a popular method used for the preparation of essential oils. However, hydrodistillation with excipients is not widely used—we have found just three studies applying this method so far [

Furthermore, this compound is non-toxic and inexpensive, as the price is ~300 eur for 25 kg. Magnesium aluminometasilicate has significantly increased both the yield and composition of some chemical compounds (sabinene, α-pinene, and limonene). The use of the excipient also increased the essential oil yield by about 61% (hydrodistillation with water—the yield is 0.79 ± 0.04 g, using 1% excipient—1.29 ± 0.05 g; the nutmeg quantity was 15 g, the water content was 300 mL) [
