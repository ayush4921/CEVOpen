<p>Hydrolats analyzed in our study had lower antioxidant activity compared to essential oils, most likely because of the lower concentrations of volatile compounds. We have searched the literature data, but could not find any studies about the antioxidant activity of nutmeg seed hydrolats so far. Hydrolats prepared from other plant sources had different antioxidant properties. For example, 
 <italic>Salvia officinalis</italic> 0.1 g/mL had about 30% radical scavenging activity. The same concentration of 
 <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> hydrolat had about 50% activity [
 <xref rid="B31-foods-09-00037" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Our hydrolats (0.1 g/mL) had 31.43 ± 1.55% (EO1) and 27.24 ± 1.63% (EO2) antioxidant activity—the same as 
 <italic>Salvia officinalis</italic>. Nutmeg seeds hydrolats at the highest concentration tested (0.5 g/mL) had 56.42% and 44.19% antioxidant activity (EOH1 and EOH2, respectively).
