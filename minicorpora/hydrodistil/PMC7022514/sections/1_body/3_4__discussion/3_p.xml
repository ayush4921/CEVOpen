<p>Essential oils are known for bioactive compounds with antibacterial activity, therefore they are used as antimicrobial agents in medicine, pharmacy, cosmetology, and other fields [
 <xref rid="B18-foods-09-00037" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, different essential oils affect microorganisms in distinct ways—some suppress gram-positive effects, others suppress gram-negative effects [
 <xref rid="B19-foods-09-00037" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Also, the effective concentration of essential oils vary. There are various methods for determining antibacterial activity (the agar disk-diffusion method, antimicrobial gradient method, dilution methods, and other methods) [
 <xref rid="B32-foods-09-00037" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Dilution methods are the simplest methods used to determine whether the essential oil suppresses the growth of bacteria or not [
 <xref rid="B23-foods-09-00037" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. There are many techniques and methods used for antimicrobial activity evaluation, and therefore, it is difficult to compare the results obtained from the different studies. In our study, the EO1 essential oil (0.2%) only suppressed 
 <italic>Pasteurella multocida</italic>. The essential oil EO2 with a higher quantity of sabinene, α-pinene, and limonene [
 <xref rid="B22-foods-09-00037" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] had antimicrobial activity against three pathogens. Next to 
 <italic>P. multocida</italic>, it also prevented growth 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic> of and 
 <italic>S. mutans</italic>. The increased efficiency of EO2 against pathogenic strains can be explained by the higher quantity of volatile compounds. Nurjanah et al.’s (2017) study showed (an in vitro disc diffusion antimicrobial activity method) that 
 <italic>Myristica fragrans</italic> essential oil (60% concentration was used) from Central Java inhibited the largest areas [
 <xref rid="B33-foods-09-00037" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The inhibition areas were from 12.96 mm to 16.79 mm, with the control at 0 mm (
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>S. dysenteriae</italic>, 
 <italic>S. typhi</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>). In the essential oil used for the above-mentioned study, sabinene, α-pinene, and β-pinene quantities were the highest out of all of the chemical compounds (the concentrations were 18.82%, 16.54%, and 13.82, respectively). The essential oil EO2 investigated in this study has a similar composition, meaning it could also be efficient against these pathogens at higher concentrations. In another study, the nutmeg essential oil with similar quantity of volatile compounds had a significant effect on the inhibition of the growth of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B34-foods-09-00037" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In this study, we found that essential oil EA2 (0.5%) inhibited 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic>. This bacteria resides in infected canals of teeth and is often found in the oral cavity after tooth canal repair [
 <xref rid="B35-foods-09-00037" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Repeated oral care products with chlorhexidine promotes the development of 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic> resistance [
 <xref rid="B36-foods-09-00037" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Since EA2 showed activity against 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic>, nutmeg essential oil could be recommended as a safe protective component for oral care products in the future.
