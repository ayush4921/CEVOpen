<p>The purpose of our study was to compare the biological activity of nutmeg seed essential oil and hydrolat without excipient and using magnesium aluminometasilicate as the excipient. To our knowledge, it is the first application of aluminometasilicate as an excipient in essential oil studies. Essential oils have strong antioxidant activity, and some of them are used as preservation agents protecting food or cosmetics from oxidation-induced spoilage [

Therefore, it was selected to evaluate the essential oil and hydrolat preparations in our study. Our previous study [
 <xref rid="B22-foods-09-00037" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] showed that magnesium aluminometasilicate had influence not only on the yield of essential oil, but also on its chemical composition. Magnesium aluminometasilicate significantly increased the quantity of sabinene, α-pinene, and limonene. Dai et al. (2013) study with 
 <italic>Wedella Prostrata</italic> essential oil (containing 11.38% limonene and 10.74% α-pinene) had a lower antioxidant activity than 100 µg/mL limonene but a higher antioxidant activity than the pure α-pinene [
 <xref rid="B28-foods-09-00037" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Such a result suggests that limonene is a more prominent antioxidant compared to α-pinene. Our nutmeg seed essential oil (EO2) had 11.66 ± 3.39% α-pinene and 4.91 ± 0.71% limonene [
 <xref rid="B22-foods-09-00037" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Based on the results of the study where the presence of limonenen together with α-pinene resulted in higher antioxidant activity [
 <xref rid="B28-foods-09-00037" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], we can predict that our EO2 has higher antioxidant activity than the pure α-pinene sample. The 
 <italic>Juniperus scopulorum</italic> 10% essential oil had a 54.7% antioxidant activity (composition: sabinene 50.7%, α-pinene 3.23%, limonene 2.22%, cis sabinene hydrate 0.58%) [
 <xref rid="B29-foods-09-00037" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Our study shows that 10% essential oils EO1 and EO2 have 61.01 ± 0.26% and 62.11 ± 0.43% antioxidant activity, respectively. Predominant compounds in EO2 were sabinene 61.42%, cis sabinene hydrate 0.3%, limonene 5.62%, and α-pinene 15.05%. The EO1 essential oil had more β-pinene [
 <xref rid="B22-foods-09-00037" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], which could increase its antioxidant activity. Other authors have demonstrated nutmeg essential oil with higher antioxidant activity besides α-pinene had also β-pinene [
 <xref rid="B27-foods-09-00037" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Misharina et al. (2009) have also studied antioxidant properties of nutmeg essential oil and found that 16.5% concentrated solution had approximately 50% antioxidant activity [
 <xref rid="B30-foods-09-00037" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Such differences may be due to the distinct technique of the research and the variation in nutmeg seed material.
