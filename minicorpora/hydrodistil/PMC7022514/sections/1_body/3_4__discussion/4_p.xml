<p>The investigation of human fibroblast cell culture affected by virus mimetic Poly I:C showed that nutmeg essential oils and hydrolats have an anti-inflammatory effect protecting cell viability and significantly reducing the release of cytokine IL-6. EO2 had a higher effect on preventing Poly I:C-induced necrosis and both EO2 and EOH2 more efficiently protected against IL-6 release compared to preparations without aluminometasilicate EO1 and EOH1. This is most likely due to the increased amount and content of active substances (sabinene, α-pinene, and limonene) in the preparations that is a result of the use of the excipient. α-Pinene significantly decreases the LPS-induced production of IL-6, TNF-α and nitric oxide in bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated macrophages [

Another in vivo study exploring carrageenan-induced paw edema in rats have also confirmed the anti-inflammatory properties of nutmeg oil [

 <italic>M. fragrans</italic> seed ethanolic extract and pure quercetin extract from 
 <italic>M. fragrans</italic> inhibited NO production and the release of inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β from bacterial LPS-stimulated murine macrophages (RAW 264.7) in a dose-dependent manner. The essential oil of 
 <italic>Monodora myristica</italic> was found to inhibit inflammation-related lipoxygenase [

 <xref rid="B41-foods-09-00037" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] the essential oils might be good candidates for inhalation treatment of respiratory tract infections. Most common respiratory infections are induced by respiratory viruses, such as influenza or respiratory syncytial virus [
 <xref rid="B42-foods-09-00037" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. As a result, we examined the anti-inflammatory efficiency of nutmeg essential oil preparations in a virus mimetic Poly I:C mediated inflammation. Fibroblasts are multifunctional cells that are responsible for support of other, more tissue-specific cell types, regeneration, wound healing, extracellular matrix production, and inflammatory response [
 <xref rid="B43-foods-09-00037" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. They significantly contribute to the response to infection by secreting cytokines for monocyte/macrophage attraction and their conversion to inflammatory phenotype [
 <xref rid="B44-foods-09-00037" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The release of IL-6 is one of the key inflammatory signals causing activation of matrix metalloproteinases, macrophages, neutrophil production, and is also involved in autoimmune responses in the condition such as chronic arthritis, osteoporosis, and psoriasis [
