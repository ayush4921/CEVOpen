0: Cell viability was assessed by using double nuclear fluorescent staining with Hoechst 33342 (10 g/mL) and propidium iodide (PI, 5 g/mL) according to standard supplier protocol for 5 min at 37 C. PI-positive nuclei indicating lost nuclear membrane integrity were considered to be necrotic.
1: Cells were visualized under fluorescent microscope OLYMPUS IX71S1F-3, counted in fluorescent micrographs and expressed as percentage of total cell number per image.
2: The data is presented as averages  standard deviation.
3: LD 50 was calculated by SigmaPlot v.13 (Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA, USA) using the equation selected by a dynamic curve fitting tool.
