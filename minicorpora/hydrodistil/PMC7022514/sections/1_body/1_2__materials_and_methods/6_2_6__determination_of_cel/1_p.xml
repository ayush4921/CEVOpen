<p>Cell viability was assessed by using double nuclear fluorescent staining with Hoechst 33342 (10 µg/mL) and propidium iodide (PI, 5 µg/mL) according to standard supplier protocol for 5 min at 37 °C. PI-positive nuclei indicating lost nuclear membrane integrity were considered to be necrotic. Cells were visualized under fluorescent microscope OLYMPUS IX71S1F-3, counted in fluorescent micrographs and expressed as percentage of total cell number per image. The data is presented as averages ± standard deviation. LD
 <sub>50</sub> was calculated by SigmaPlot v.13 (Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA, USA) using the equation selected by a dynamic curve fitting tool.
