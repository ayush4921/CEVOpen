<p>The essential oil from nutmeg seeds was prepared by using hydrodistillation. The modified Clevenger type apparatus was used. Two samples of essential oil were prepared: one without excipient and the other with 1% of magnesium aluminometasilicate. Each sample was prepared with 15 g of nutmeg powder and 300 mL distilled water, and 1% magnesium aluminometasilicate was used as an excipient in one of the samples. Also, hydrolat of these two essential oils was used. It was collected from Clevenger apparatus. This material was collected first, followed by the essential oil. All samples were obtained and stored in airtight bottles in the refrigerator. The hydrodistillation took 4 h.</p>
