0: The method used for antimicrobial activity was serial dilutions in liquid medium [ 23].
1: The broth liquid medium was dispensed into test tubes to give a final volume of 10 mL (with a sample of essential oil).
2: The medium was sterilized.
3: The physiological solution was dispensed into 5 mL individual tubes and used for preparation of suspension of the following bacteria:  Klebsiella pneumoniae;  Salmonella enterica 24 SPn06;  Pseudomonas aeruginosa 17331;  Acinetobacter baumanni 17380,  Proteus mirabilis; 6MRSA M87fox;  Enterococcus faecalis 86;  Enterococcus faecium 103;  Bacillus cereus 18 01;  Streptococcus mutans (referent);  Enterobacter cloacae;  Citrobacter freundii;  Staphylococcus epidermidis;  Staphylococcus haemolyticus;  Pasteurella multocida strains.
4: All bacteria were isolated from clinical material.
5: For each bacterial culture, three tubes of Mueller Hinton broth were used (9.94 mL, 9.97 mL, and 9.98 mL each).
6: The tubes were inoculated with 10 L of bacterial suspension with the essential oil at concentration 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.5%.
7: After 48 h of incubation, each tube was inoculated with 10 L of suspension on soy-tryptone agar (Thermo Fisher, Hampshire, UK).
8: MIC of essential oil was evaluated based on the presence of bacterial growth (bacterial colonies growing (+)/non growing ().
