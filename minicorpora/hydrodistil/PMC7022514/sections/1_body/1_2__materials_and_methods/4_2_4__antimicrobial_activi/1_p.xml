<p>The method used for antimicrobial activity was serial dilutions in liquid medium [
 <xref rid="B23-foods-09-00037" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The broth liquid medium was dispensed into test tubes to give a final volume of 10 mL (with a sample of essential oil). The medium was sterilized. The physiological solution was dispensed into 5 mL individual tubes and used for preparation of suspension of the following bacteria: 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>; 
 <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> 24 SPn06; 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> 17–331; 
 <italic>Acinetobacter baumanni</italic> 17–380, 
 <italic>Proteus mirabilis</italic>; 6MRSA M87fox; 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> 86; 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecium</italic> 103; 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> 18 01; 
 <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> (referent); 
 <italic>Enterobacter cloacae</italic>; 
 <italic>Citrobacter freundii</italic>; 
 <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic>; 
 <italic>Staphylococcus haemolyticus</italic>; 
 <italic>Pasteurella multocida strains.</italic> All bacteria were isolated from clinical material. For each bacterial culture, three tubes of Mueller Hinton broth were used (9.94 mL, 9.97 mL, and 9.98 mL each). The tubes were inoculated with 10 μL of bacterial suspension with the essential oil at concentration 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.5%. After 48 h of incubation, each tube was inoculated with 10 μL of suspension on soy-tryptone agar (Thermo Fisher, Hampshire, UK). MIC of essential oil was evaluated based on the presence of bacterial growth (bacterial colonies growing (+)/non growing (−).
