<p>Human fibroblasts (BJ-5ta, hTERT, LGC Standards Ltd. Middlesex, UK) were grown in 75 cm
 <sup>2</sup> flasks in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) with Glutamax (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 IU/mL Penicilin/Streptomycin according to standard supplier protocol. At 70–90% confluence, the cells were detached by 0.025% Trypsin/EDTA and plated in 96 well plates at a density of 2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well. A total of 24 h after plating, the cells were treated with 1 µg/mL Poly I:C to simulate viral dsRNR-induced inflammatory response. For cell culture treatments, the essential oils were dissolved in 96% ethanol at a concentration of 5% (

 <italic>v</italic> ratio of 1:1000 and finishing with 1:5. For the control, the same dilutions with solvent (ethanol) were performed. For anti-inflammatory activity evaluation, the solutions of essential oils at
