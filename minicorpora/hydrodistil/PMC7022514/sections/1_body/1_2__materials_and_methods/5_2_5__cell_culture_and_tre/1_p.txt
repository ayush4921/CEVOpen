0: Human fibroblasts (BJ-5ta, hTERT, LGC Standards Ltd. Middlesex, UK) were grown in 75 cm 2 flasks in Dulbeccos Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) with Glutamax (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 IU/mL Penicilin/Streptomycin according to standard supplier protocol.
1: At 7090% confluence, the cells were detached by 0.025% Trypsin/EDTA and plated in 96 well plates at a density of 2  10 5 cells/well.
2: A total of 24 h after plating, the cells were treated with 1 g/mL Poly I:C to simulate viral dsRNR-induced inflammatory response.
3: For cell culture treatments, the essential oils were dissolved in 96% ethanol at a concentration of 5% ( v/ v).
4: For determination of cell viability and LD 50, the solutions of essential oils and absolute hydrolats were used as a range of dilutions in cell culture medium starting from essential oil preparation to a medium  v/ v ratio of 1:1000 and finishing with 1:5.
5: For the control, the same dilutions with solvent (ethanol) were performed.
6: For anti-inflammatory activity evaluation, the solutions of essential oils at  v/ v dilutions of 1:100 or 1:200, or absolute hydrolats at  v/ v dilutions of 1:40, 1:100, and 1:200 were applied simultaneously with Poly I:C treatment.
