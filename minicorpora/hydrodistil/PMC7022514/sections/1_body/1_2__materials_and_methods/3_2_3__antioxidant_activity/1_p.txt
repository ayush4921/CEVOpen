0: Antioxidant activity of nutmeg essential oil and hydrolat were evaluated using DPPH (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) [ 15].
1: First of all, 0.1 mM 96% DPPH solution in 96% ethanol was prepared.
2: A total of 1 mL of DPPH solution was placed in a spectrophotometer cuvette and 100 L of ethanolic essential oil solution at concentrations ranging from 0.2% to 20% was added.
3: For an antioxidant activity evaluation of hydrolat, the absolute hydrolat was used.
4: 1 mL DPPH solution and nutmeg hydrolat from 0.1 mL to 1 mL were mixed in a cuvette.
5: All samples were incubated in the dark for 20 min and absorbance was taken at 515 nm.
6: The antioxidant activity was performed on a UV Spectrophotometer UV-1800 (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan).
7: The quantity of DPPH radical scavenging activity was calculated by using this formula: (1)DPPH scavenging effect %=AcontrolAsampleAcontrol100, where  A  control and  A  sample are the absorbance of the control sample (0.1 mM DPPH solution, solvent is 96% ethanol) and the experiment sample.
