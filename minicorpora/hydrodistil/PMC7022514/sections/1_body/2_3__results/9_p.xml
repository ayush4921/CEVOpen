<p>As indicated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-09-00037-f001">Figure 1</xref>a, there were no significant difference in cell viability detected after treatment with both EO1 and EO2 essential oil solutions up to the dilution ratio 1:100. Further increases in concentration up to the dilution ratio 1:40 significantly decreased viability of the fibroblasts. After treatment with essential oil solutions at 1:40, the viability dropped from 97 ± 2% in control to 70 ± 12% in the case of EO1, and to 42 ± 10% in the case of EO2. At the dilution ratio of 1:5, the percentage of viable cells in the cultures was lower than 10% in the case of both essential oil preparations. The dilution ratios corresponding to LD
 <sub>50</sub> calculated for EO1, EO2, and 96% ethanol were 0.047, 0.022, and 0.055, respectively. Thus, EO2 was significantly more toxic for the cells compared to EO1, and also to ethanol. In contrast, the toxicity pattern of EO1 was very close to that of ethanol, indicating there were no or very little toxic compounds in this essential oil preparation.
