<p>EO1 only suppressed 
 <italic>Pasteurella multocida</italic> growth, with the minimal concentration to achieve this effect being 0.2%. However, nutmeg essential oil with 1% of magnesium aluminometasilicate (EO2) had a broader effect. Next to 
 <italic>P. multocida</italic>, it inhibited 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic> and 
 <italic>S. mutans</italic>, and the efficient concentrations were rather low. A mere 0.5% was enough to completely suppress 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic>, and for the 
 <italic>S. mutans</italic> strain even less than 0.1% was effective. In the case of EOH1 and EOH2, only the hydrolat with aluminometasilicate suppressed the growth of 
 <italic>S. mutans.</italic> Thus, the results indicate that the excipient magnesium aluminometasilicate broadens the spectrum of antimicrobial activity of nutmeg essential oil.
