<p>At small quantities of up to 0.3 mL, the antioxidant activities of both hydrolat preparations were similar, but at 0.5 mL and 1 mL, the EOH1 antioxidant activity was significantly higher compared to that of EOH2. EOH1 at 1 mL had an antioxidant activity greater than 50%, and this activity level was similar to 5%â€“10% of EO1 activity. The results show that free radical scavenging activity of 0.2 mL of hydrolat is higher than that of 1% or less concentrated essential oil.</p>
