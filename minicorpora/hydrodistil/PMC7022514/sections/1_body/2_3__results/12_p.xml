<p>After fibroblast cell culture treatment with 1 mg/mL Poly I:C, the amount of viable cells decreased by 59% (

Statistically significant differences compared with Poly I:C samples were found after treatment with 1:200 EO1, 1:200 and 1:100 EO2, as well as 1:40 EOH1 and 1:40 EOH2. The percentages of viable nuclei in these samples were 81 ± 9%, 82 ± 16%, 76 ± 10%, 72 ± 14%, and 79 ± 12%, respectively. Thus, EO2 has demonstrated the highest cytoprotective capacity in a virus mimetic inflammation model.
