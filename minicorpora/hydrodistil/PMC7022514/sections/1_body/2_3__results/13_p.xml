<p>Evaluation of the release of IL-6 to the incubation medium revealed that after 24 h of Poly I:C treatment, the level of this pro-inflammatory cytokine jumped from nearly a “zero” value to 883 ± 273 pg/mL (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-09-00037-f002">Figure 2</xref>b). Nutmeg essential oil preparations applied together with Poly I:C significantly reduced the concentration of IL-6 in the medium. The significant drop in the IL-6 level was in the samples incubated with 1:100 EO1, 1:200 and 1:100 EO2, 1:40 EOH1, and 1:100 and 1:40 EOH2. IL-6 concentration in these samples was found in the range between 162 ± 123 pg/mL (with 1:40 EOH2) and 206 ± 83 pg/mL (with 1:100 EO1). The assessment of IL-6 release indicates that both the solution of nutmeg seed essential oil with magnesium aluminometasilicate and the hydrolat from this essential oil are most efficient against Poly I:C-induced release of this inflammatory cytokine.
