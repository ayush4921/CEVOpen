<p>Evaluation of cell viability after 24 h treatment with nutmeg seed essential oil hydrolats revealed that both EOH1 and EOH2 were not toxic up to a dilution of 1:20 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-09-00037-f001">Figure 1</xref>b). After cell incubation with 1:10 EOH2, the percentage of viable cells in the cultures decreased to 57 ± 19%, making a significant difference compared with the untreated control. A significant viability drop in EOH1 treatment series was achieved when the dilution ratio 1:5 was applied. The level of viable cells in this treated cultures was 44 ± 14%. After treatment with EOH1 and EOH2 at the ratio 1:2, nearly all cells in the cultures were found to be necrotic. The dilution ratios corresponding to LD
 <sub>50</sub> calculated for EOH1 and EOH2 were 0.160 and 0.105, respectively. Toxicity evaluation of the hydrolats indicated that EOH2 is slightly more toxic compared to EOH1.
