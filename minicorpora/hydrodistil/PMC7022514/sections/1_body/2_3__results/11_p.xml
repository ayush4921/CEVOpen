<p>The next task in this work was to evaluate the efficiency of nutmeg seed essential oil and hydrolat preparations to reduce toxicity and signaling in viral inflammation in vitro model. To stimulate inflammatory response, human fibroblast cell culture was treated with 1 Âµg/mL virus double stranded RNR mimetic polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C) for 24 h, with or without nutmeg seed essential oil solutions or hydrolats. After toxicity assessment, the dilution ratios selected for anti-inflammatory property testing were 1:200 and 1:100 for the essential oil solutions, and 1:100 and 1:40 for the hydrolats. Anti-inflammatory assessment results are presented in
