 <caption> The effect of nutmeg essential oil ethanol solutions ( a) and nutmeg essential oil hydrolats ( b) on viability of cultured human fibroblasts. EO1—essential oil without excipient solution, EO2—essential oil with 1% magnesium aluminometasilicate solution, EOH1—hydrolat from EO1, and EOH2—hydrolat from EO2. In addition, 96% ethanol was assessed as solvent control for the essential oil. Punctured lines indicate the dilution ratios corresponding to LD 50. *—statistically significant difference compared to untreated control, #—compared to EO1 in ( a) or EOH1 in ( b), respectively, when p &lt; 0.05. </caption>
