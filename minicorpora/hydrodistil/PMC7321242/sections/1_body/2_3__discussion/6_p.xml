<p>Furthermore, 
 <italic>C. articulatus</italic> rhizome EO inhibited the development of liver cancer HepG2 cells in a mouse xenograft model. At doses of 40 and 80 mg/kg intraperitoneally for 21 consecutive days, the inhibition rates of tumor mass were 46.5–50.0%. In addition, no significant side effects were found in this in vivo study, suggesting that, although this EO has shown low selectivity with SI below 2-fold for all cancer cells (compared to doxorubicin with an SI greater than 7-fold and 5-fluorouracil with an SI greater than 4-fold), it appears to be safe for systemic administration. The amount of EO obtained was a limitation to test it in different cell models, as well as to obtain a dose–response curve in vivo using a larger number of doses. Likewise, 
 <italic>Guatteria megalophylla</italic> leaf essential also inhibited the development of HL-60 cells in a xenograft model with tumor mass inhibition rates of 16.6-48.8% at doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg, when administrated intraperitoneally once a day for nine consecutive days [
