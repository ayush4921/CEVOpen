<p>In addition, 
 <italic>C. articulatus</italic> rhizome EO caused the cell cycle arrest in the G
 <sub>2</sub>/M phase and cell death in HepG2 cells, suggesting that this oil acts causing interruptions in the progress of the cell cycle. The EO from 
 <italic>Pinus koraiensis</italic> (Pinaceae) also arrested the cell cycle in the G
 <sub>2</sub>/M phase and induced cell death in gastric adenocarcinoma MGC-803 cells. The main chemical constituents were α-pinene, limonene and β-pinene [

 <italic>Melaleuca alternifolia</italic> (Myrtaceae) arrested the cell cycle in the G
 <sub>2</sub>/M phase, causing cell death in human melanoma A-375 cells and squamous cell carcinoma HEp-2 cells [
