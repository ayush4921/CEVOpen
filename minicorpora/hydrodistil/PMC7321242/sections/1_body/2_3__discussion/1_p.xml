<p>Herein, we demonstrate, for the first time, that 
 <italic>C. articulatus</italic> rhizome EO causes cell cycle arrest in the G
 <sub>2</sub>/M phase and cell death in HepG2 cells and inhibits the development of tumors in a xenograft model. The main chemical constituents present in this EO sample were muskatone, cyclocolorenone, α-pinene, pogostol, α-copaene and caryophyllene oxide. The compositional results obtained are in accordance with the previously published EO of 
 <italic>C. articulatus</italic> rhizome collected in the state of Pará, Brazil [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-25-02687" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-25-02687" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. On the other hand, the same species, when collected in African countries (e.g., Egypt), presented different main compositions, including γ-patchoulene, caryophyllene oxide and α-cadinol [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-25-02687" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], indicating a high variability in the composition of EO. Water stress, nutrition, soil and climate conditions, and other abiotic factors can be responsible for these variations.
