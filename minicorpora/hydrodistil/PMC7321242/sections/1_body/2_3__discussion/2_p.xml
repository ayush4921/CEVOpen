<p>In our cytotoxic screening program, extract/EO samples with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value below 30 μg/mL against cancer cell lines are selected for further studies [

 <italic>C. articulatus</italic> rhizome EO showed an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 28.5 μg/mL against liver cancer HepG2 cells, presenting moderate potency when compared to doxorubicin that showed an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.03 μg/mL and 5-fluorouracil with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.2 μg/mL for this cell line. As mentioned above, 
 <italic>C. articulatus</italic> rhizome EO, collected in northern Nigeria, showed cytotoxicity against human breast adenocarcinoma MDA-MB-231 cells [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-25-02687" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Here, we demonstrate the cytotoxicity of 
 <italic>C. articulatus</italic> rhizome EO, collected in the Brazilian Amazon rainforest, against five cancer cell lines (HepG2, HCT116, MCF-7, HL-60 and B16-F10) and one non-cancerous one (MRC-5). Interestingly, many of the main chemical constituents found in Nigeria’s EO sample are not found in the Brazilian EO sample.
