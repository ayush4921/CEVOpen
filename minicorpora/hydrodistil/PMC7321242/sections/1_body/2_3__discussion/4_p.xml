<p>In relation to the cytotoxic study with the main chemical constituents of 
 <italic>C. articulatus</italic> rhizome EO, the cytotoxic potential of α-pinene, α-copaene and caryophyllene oxide were previously reported [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-25-02687" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-25-02687" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-25-02687" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,

 <xref rid="B36-molecules-25-02687" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. α-Pinene, at 1000 μg/mL, inhibited the human carcinoma hepatocellular BEL-7402 cells proliferation, arresting cell growth in the G
 <sub>2</sub>/M phase of the cell cycle, decreasing gene and protein expressions of Cdc25C, and reducing the cycle dependence on kinase 1 (CDK1) activity [

 <xref rid="B33-molecules-25-02687" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Moreover, α-pinene (20 μg/mL) inhibited the progression of cell cycle in the G
 <sub>2</sub>/M phase and induced apoptotic cell death through the activation of caspase in human ovarian carcinoma PA-1 cells [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-25-02687" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. α-Copaene has been reported to suppress the proliferation of the normal neuron and N2a neuroblastoma cells of rats with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 400 μg/mL [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-25-02687" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Caryophyllene oxide, at a concentration of 10 μg/mL, induced apoptosis in the PC-3 and MCF-7 cell lines by activating reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and inhibiting the constitutive cascades of PI3K/AKT/mTOR/S6K1 signaling [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-25-02687" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Cytotoxicity data for muskatone, cyclocolorenone and pogostol were not found. On the other hand, the mixture of the main and minor constituents of 
 <italic>C. articulatus</italic> rhizome EO must be responsible for its cytotoxicity, since α-pinene, α-copaene and caryophyllene oxide represent less than 20% of this EO.
