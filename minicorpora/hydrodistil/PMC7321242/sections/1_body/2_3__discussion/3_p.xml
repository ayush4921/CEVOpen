<p>In the 
 <italic>Cyperus</italic> genus, Kilani et al. [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-25-02687" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] reported that EO from the tuber of 
 <italic>C. rotundus</italic> caused cytotoxicity in L1210 leukemia cell line with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 49 μg/mL and increased apoptotic DNA fragmentation. The main constituents identified were α-cyperone and cyperene. In another study, the EO from rhizomes of 
 <italic>C. rotundus</italic> showed α-cyperone, cyperene and α-selinene as major components and was cytotoxic to human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value 1000 μg/mL [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-25-02687" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The EO of the entire plant of 
 <italic>C. longus</italic> induced cell death in human prostate adenocarcinoma PC3 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 39.91 μg/mL) and MCF-7 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 31.35 μg/mL) cell lines, and β-himachalene, α-caryophyllene oxide, irisone, β-caryophyllene oxide, humulene oxide, viridiflorol, aristolone and longiverbenone were the main chemical constituents found [
