2: [ 19] published a preliminary study showing that  C. articulatus rhizome essential oil (EO), collected in northern Nigeria, exhibited cytotoxicity against human breast adenocarcinoma MDA-MB-231 cells, and its chemical composition included sesquiterpenes, monoterpenes, nootkatone, 6-methyl-3,5-heptadien-2-one, retinene, nopinone, cycloeucalenol, anozol, toosendanin, furanone, ethanone and vitamin A [ 19].
3: Here, the  C. articulatus rhizome EO, collected in the Brazilian Amazon rainforest, was studied for its chemical composition, induction of cell death in vitro and the inhibition of tumor development in vivo using human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells as a cell model.
