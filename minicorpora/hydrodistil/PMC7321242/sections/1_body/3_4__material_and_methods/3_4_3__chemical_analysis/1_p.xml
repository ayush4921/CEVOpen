<p>The identification of chemical constituents was evaluated by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) with a model equipment GCMS/QP2010 Plus (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a capillary column Rtx-5 MS (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm, Restek). Helium at a flow of 1.02 mL/min was the carrier, and injections (1 μL) were performed with 1.5 mg/mL EO stock solution in chloroform with a 1:50 partition ratio. The column temperature program was 50 to 285 °C with gradual increases of 3 °C/min. The injector and ion source temperatures were 215 and 265 °C, respectively. First, constituent identifications were based on comparisons of the spectra obtained with those stored in the Wiley 8th edition library (only similarities &gt; 90% were considered) [

A system consisting of a GC2010 device (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with an Rtx-5 capillary column was used under the same conditions as the GC-MS analysis. Relative quantities (%) were calculated in relation to the total chromatogram area of three independent replications.
