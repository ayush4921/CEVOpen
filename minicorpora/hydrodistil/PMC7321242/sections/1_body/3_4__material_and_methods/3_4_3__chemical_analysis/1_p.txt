0: The identification of chemical constituents was evaluated by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) with a model equipment GCMS/QP2010 Plus (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a capillary column Rtx-5 MS (30 m  0.25 mm  0.25 m, Restek).
1: Helium at a flow of 1.02 mL/min was the carrier, and injections (1 L) were performed with 1.5 mg/mL EO stock solution in chloroform with a 1:50 partition ratio.
2: The column temperature program was 50 to 285 C with gradual increases of 3 C/min.
3: The injector and ion source temperatures were 215 and 265 C, respectively.
4: First, constituent identifications were based on comparisons of the spectra obtained with those stored in the Wiley 8th edition library (only similarities > 90% were considered) [ 39].
5: Confirmations were performed by calculating of the retention indices (RI) according to the equation of Van den Dool and Kratz [ 40] compared to a homologous series consisting by linear hydrocarbons ranging from  n-C 7 to  n-C 30.
6: A semi-quantitative analysis was performed to obtain the relative quantity of each EO component.
7: For that, gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (GC-FID) was applied.
8: A system consisting of a GC2010 device (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with an Rtx-5 capillary column was used under the same conditions as the GC-MS analysis.
9: Relative quantities (%) were calculated in relation to the total chromatogram area of three independent replications.
