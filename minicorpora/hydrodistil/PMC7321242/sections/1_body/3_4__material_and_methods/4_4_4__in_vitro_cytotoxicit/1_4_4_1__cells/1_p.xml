<p>Cell lines HepG2 (human hepatocellular carcinoma), HCT116 (human colon carcinoma), MCF-7 (human breast adenocarcinoma), HL-60 (human promyelocytic leukemia), B16-F10 (mouse melanoma) and MRC-5 (fibroblast from human lung) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) and were cultured following the instructions in the ATCC animal cell culture guide. All cell lines were tested for mycoplasma using a mycoplasma stain kit (Sigma-Aldrich) to validate the use of contamination-free cells. Cell viability was examined by the trypan blue exclusion (TBE) assay in all experiments. All experiments were carried out in an exponential growth phase.</p>
