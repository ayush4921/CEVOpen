<p>Cell viability was quantified by the Alamar blue assay as previously described [

 <xref rid="B43-molecules-25-02687" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Briefly, cells were seeded in 96-well plates. EO (in eight different concentrations ranging from 0.4 to 50 μg/mL), dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Vetec Química Fina Ltd.a, Duque de Caxias, RJ, Brazil), was added to each well and incubated for 72 h. Doxorubicin (in eight different concentrations ranging from 0.04 to 5 μg/mL) (purity ≥ 95%, doxorubicin hydrochloride, Laboratory IMA S.A.I.C., Buenos Aires, Argentina) and 5-fluorouracil (in eight different concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 25 μg/mL) (5-FU, purity &gt; 99%; Sigma Chemical Co., St Louis, MO, USA) were used as positive controls. At the end of the treatment, 20 μL of a stock solution (0.312 mg/mL) of resazurin (Sigma-Aldrich Co., Saint Louis, MO, USA) was added to each well. Absorbances at 570 and 600 nm were measured using a SpectraMax 190 Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The values of half-maximum inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) and their respective 95% confidence intervals were calculated by non-linear regression through concentration–response curves. The selectivity index (SI) was calculated using the following formula: SI = IC
 <sub>50</sub> (non-cancerous cells)/IC
 <sub>50</sub> (cancer cells).
