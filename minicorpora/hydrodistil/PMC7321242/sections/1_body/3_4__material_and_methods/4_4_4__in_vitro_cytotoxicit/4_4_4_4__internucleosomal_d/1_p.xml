<p>The fragmentation of internucleosomal DNA and the distribution of the cell cycle were carried out as previously described [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-25-02687" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Briefly, the cells were harvested in a permeabilization solution (0.1% triton X-100, 2 µg/mL PI, 0.1% sodium citrate and 100 µg/mL RNAse, all from Sigma-Aldrich Co.) and incubated in the dark for 15 min at room temperature. Then, cell fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry. At least 10
 <sup>4</sup> events were recorded per sample using a BD LSRFortessa cytometer along with BD FACSDiva Software (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, EUA) and Flowjo Software 10 (Flowjo LCC, Ashland, OR, USA). Cell debris was omitted from the analyses.
