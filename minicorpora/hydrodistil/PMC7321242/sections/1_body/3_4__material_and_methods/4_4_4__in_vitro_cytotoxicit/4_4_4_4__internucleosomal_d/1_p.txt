0: The fragmentation of internucleosomal DNA and the distribution of the cell cycle were carried out as previously described [ 44].
1: Briefly, the cells were harvested in a permeabilization solution (0.1% triton X-100, 2 g/mL PI, 0.1% sodium citrate and 100 g/mL RNAse, all from Sigma-Aldrich Co.) and incubated in the dark for 15 min at room temperature.
2: Then, cell fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry.
3: At least 10 4 events were recorded per sample using a BD LSRFortessa cytometer along with BD FACSDiva Software (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, EUA) and Flowjo Software 10 (Flowjo LCC, Ashland, OR, USA).
4: Cell debris was omitted from the analyses.
