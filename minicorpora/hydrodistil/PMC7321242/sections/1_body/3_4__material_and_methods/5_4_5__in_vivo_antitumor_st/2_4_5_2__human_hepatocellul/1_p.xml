<p>Human hepatocellular carcinoma xenograft model was performed as previously described [

 <xref rid="B46-molecules-25-02687" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-25-02687" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In summary, HepG2 cells (10
 <sup>7</sup> cells per 500 ÂµL) were implanted subcutaneously in the left frontal axils of the mice. At the beginning of the experiment, the mice were randomly divided into four groups. Group 1: animals received injections of vehicle with 5% DMSO solution (
 <italic>n</italic> = 20). Group 2: animals received injections of 5-fluorouracil (10 mg/kg, Sigma-Aldrich, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 10). Group 3: animals received injections of EO at 40 mg/kg (
 <italic>n</italic> = 10). Group 4: animals received injections of EO at 80 mg/kg (
 <italic>n</italic> = 10). Beginning one day after tumor implantation, the animals were treated intraperitoneally for 21 consecutive days. One day after the end of the treatment, the animals were anesthetized (50 mg/kg thiopental) and peripheral blood samples were collected from the brachial artery. The animals were euthanized by anesthetic overdose (100 mg/kg thiopental) and the tumors were excised and weighed.
