0: Human hepatocellular carcinoma xenograft model was performed as previously described [ 45, 46, 47].
1: In summary, HepG2 cells (10 7 cells per 500 L) were implanted subcutaneously in the left frontal axils of the mice.
2: At the beginning of the experiment, the mice were randomly divided into four groups.
3: Group 1: animals received injections of vehicle with 5% DMSO solution ( n = 20).
4: Group 2: animals received injections of 5-fluorouracil (10 mg/kg, Sigma-Aldrich,  n = 10).
5: Group 3: animals received injections of EO at 40 mg/kg ( n = 10).
6: Group 4: animals received injections of EO at 80 mg/kg ( n = 10).
7: Beginning one day after tumor implantation, the animals were treated intraperitoneally for 21 consecutive days.
8: One day after the end of the treatment, the animals were anesthetized (50 mg/kg thiopental) and peripheral blood samples were collected from the brachial artery.
9: The animals were euthanized by anesthetic overdose (100 mg/kg thiopental) and the tumors were excised and weighed.
