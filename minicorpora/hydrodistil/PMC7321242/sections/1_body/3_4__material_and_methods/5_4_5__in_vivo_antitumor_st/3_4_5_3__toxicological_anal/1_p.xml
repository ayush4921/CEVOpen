<p>The animals were weighed at the beginning and the end of the experiment to assess the toxicological effects. All animals were observed for signs of abnormality throughout the study. Hematological analyses were performed using an Advia 60 hematology system (Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany). Livers, kidneys, lungs and hearts were collected, weighed and examined for signs of thick lesion formation, color change and/or hemorrhage. After macroscopic examination, the tumors, livers, kidneys, lungs and hearts were fixed in 4% buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. The tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (and Periodic acid-Schiff for kidneys slides), and a pathologist performed the analysis under an optical microscope.</p>
