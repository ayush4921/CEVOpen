<p>Then, we quantified the number of viable HepG2 cells by trypan blue exclusion (TBE) assay after 24, 48 and 72 h of incubation with EO (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02687-f001">Figure 1</xref>). At concentrations of 12.5, 25 and 50 μg/mL, EO reduced the number of viable cells by 37.9, 47.9 and 61.4% after 48 h, and by 42.2, 58.8 and 87.9% after 72 h, respectively. Doxorubicin, at 1 μg/mL, reduced the number of viable cells by 43.0% after 24 h, 85.5% after 48 h and 98.9% after 72 h.
