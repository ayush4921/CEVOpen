<p>The cytotoxic activity of EO was examined against five cancer cell lines (HepG2, HCT116, MCF-7, HL-60 and B16-F10) and one non-cancerous one (MRC-5) using the Alamar blue assay after 72 h of incubation (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-02687-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). EO showed IC
 <sub>50</sub> values for cancer cell lines ranging from 28.5 µg/mL for HepG2 to &gt;50 µg/mL for HCT116, and IC
 <sub>50</sub> value for non-cancerous MRC-5 cells of 46.0 µg/mL. Doxorubicin was used as a positive control and exhibited IC
 <sub>50</sub> values for cancer cell lines ranging from 0.03 µg/mL for HepG2 to 0.3 µg/mL for MCF-7 and an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value for non-cancerous MRC-5 cells of 0.2 µg/mL. 5-Fluorouracil was also used as a positive control and showed IC
 <sub>50</sub> values for cancer cell lines ranging from 0.2 µg/mL for HepG2 to 1.8 µg/mL for MCF-7 and IC
 <sub>50</sub> value for non-cancerous MRC-5 cells of 7.5 µg/mL. The selectivity indexes (SIs) were calculated and are shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-02687-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The EO showed low selectivity with an SI below 2-fold for all cancer cells tested.
