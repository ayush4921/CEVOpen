<p>The morphological changes in HepG2 cells treated with EO were analyzed by optical microscopy using the May–Grunwald–Giemsa stain after 24, 48 and 72 h of incubation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02687-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Treatment with EO caused cell shrinkage and/or chromatin condensation, morphological changes associated to apoptotic cell death. Doxorubicin also caused morphological changes related to apoptosis.
