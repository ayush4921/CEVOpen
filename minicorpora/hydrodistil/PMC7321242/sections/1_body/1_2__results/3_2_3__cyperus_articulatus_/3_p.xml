<p>Cell death was also evaluated by flow cytometry using annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide (PI) staining and the percentage of cells in viable (annexin V-FITC/PI double negative cells), early apoptotic (annexin V-FITC positive, but PI negative cells), late apoptotic (annexin V-FITC/PI double positive cells) and necrotic stages (PI positive, but annexin V-FITC negative cells) were quantified after 24 h, 48 h and 72 h of incubation (
