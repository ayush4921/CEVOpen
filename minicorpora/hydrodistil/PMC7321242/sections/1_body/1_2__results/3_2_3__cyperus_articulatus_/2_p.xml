<p>The content of intracellular DNA in HepG2 cells treated with EO, at concentrations of 12.5, 25 and 50 μg/mL, was also quantified by flow cytometry after 24, 48 and 72 h of incubation to measure the fragmentation of internucleosomal DNA (DNA that was sub-diploid in size [sub-G
 <sub>0</sub>/G
 <sub>1</sub>]) and the distribution of cell cycle (phases G
 <sub>0</sub>/G
 <sub>1</sub>, S and G
 <sub>2</sub>/M). HepG2 cultures treated with EO showed cell cycle arrest in the G
 <sub>2</sub>/M phase, along with the fragmentation of internucleosomal DNA (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02687-f004">Figure 4</xref>). The cultures treated with EO showed 24.7, 27.7 and 24.3% of cells in the G
 <sub>2</sub>/M phase in the highest concentration after 24, 48 and 72 h of incubation, against 16.1, 10.3, 15.4 % observed for the negative control, respectively. The percentages of cells with DNA fragmentation were 22.0, 26.0 and 36.4%, at concentrations of 12.5, 25 and 50 μg/mL, respectively, against 9.0% observed for the negative control after 72 h of incubation. Doxorubicin (1 μg/mL) also caused cell cycle arrest in the G
 <sub>2</sub>/M phase, followed by the fragmentation of internucleosomal DNA.
