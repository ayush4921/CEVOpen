<p>The in vivo anti-liver-cancer activity of EO was evaluated in C.B-17 severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice with HepG2 cell xenografts. EO was administrated at doses of 40 and 80 mg/kg intraperitoneally, once a day, for 21 consecutive days. These doses were selected based on previous studies, using EO in tumor-bearing mice models [

 <xref rid="B21-molecules-25-02687" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The animals treated with EO showed an average tumor mass weight of 0.27 ± 0.05 g and 0.25 ± 0.02 g in the lowest and highest doses, respectively, while 0.51 ± 0.05 g was observed in the negative control group (

In the histological analysis of the tumors, we observed a carcinoma organized in multiple hypovascularized nodules delimited by a fibrous capsule, composed of hyperchromatic and highly malignant pleomorphic cells, in all groups. The tumor cells were actively dividing with the visible necrotic area observed in all groups, despite a lower frequency of mitoses in mice treated with EO at the highest dose. Degeneration and necrosis were observed in all groups, but to a lesser extent in the negative control and EO (lowest dose) groups (
