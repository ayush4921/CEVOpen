<p>Histological analyses of the liver, kidney, lung and heart were also performed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02687-f009">Figure 9</xref>). The hepatic and portal architecture were preserved in most livers, except for two animals of the EO group (highest dose) and all animals of the 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) group, for presenting the focal areas of coagulation necrosis. The histopathological changes observed were vascular congestion, hydropic degeneration and focal inflammation, predominantly mononuclear, in the portal region, ranging from mild to moderate. In the kidneys, the tissue architecture was maintained, however, histopathological changes were observed in all experimental groups, such as moderate vascular congestion and the thickening of the basal membrane of the renal glomerulus, varying from mild to moderate, with decreased urinary space. In addition, focal areas of coagulation necrosis were observed in two animals treated with EO at the lowest dose.
