 <xref rid="molecules-25-02687-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Among the different types, monoterpenes (hydrocarbons 14.59%; oxygenated 8.29%) and sesquiterpenes (hydrocarbons 8.98%; oxygenated 47.49%) and trace of diterpenes were identified. The main representative substances of this EO sample were muskatone (11.60 ± 1.19%), cyclocolorenone (10.30 ± 1.02%), α-pinene (8.26 ± 0.74), pogostol (6.36 ± 0.88%), 
 <italic>α</italic>-copaene (4.83 ± 0.45%) and caryophyllene oxide (4.82 ± 0.44%).
