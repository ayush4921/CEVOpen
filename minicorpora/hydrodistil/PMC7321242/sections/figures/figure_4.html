 <caption> Effect of Cyperus articulatus rhizome essential oil (EO) on the cell cycle distribution of HepG2 cells after 24 ( A), 48 ( B) and 72 ( C) h. The negative control (CTL) was treated with a vehicle (0.5% DMSO) used to dilute EO, and doxorubicin (DOX) was used as a positive control. The data are presented as the mean ± S.E.M. of three independent experiments carried out in duplicate. Ten thousand events were evaluated per experiment, and cell debris was omitted from the analysis. * p &lt; 0.05 compared with the negative control by ANOVA, followed by the Newman–Keuls test. </caption>
