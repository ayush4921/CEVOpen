 <caption> Effect of Cyperus articulatus rhizome essential oil (EO) on the viability of HepG2 cells, as measured by the trypan blue dye exclusion assay after 24 ( A, D), 48 ( B, E) and 72 ( C, F) h of incubation. The negative control (CTL) was treated with a vehicle (0.5% DMSO) used to dilute EO, and doxorubicin (DOX, 1 µg/mL) was used as a positive control. The data are presented as the mean ± S.E.M. of three independent experiments carried out in duplicate. * p &lt; 0.05 compared with the negative control by ANOVA, followed by the Student–Newman–Keuls test. </caption>
