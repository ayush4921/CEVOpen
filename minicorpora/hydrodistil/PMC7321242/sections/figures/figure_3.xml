 <caption>
  <p>Representative flow cytometric histograms of the cell cycle distribution of HepG2 cells treated with 
   <italic>Cyperus articulatus</italic> rhizome essential oil (EO). The negative control (CTL) was treated with a vehicle (0.5% DMSO) used to dilute EO, and doxorubicin (DOX, 1 Âµg/mL) was used as a positive control. Ten thousand events were evaluated per experiment, and cell debris was omitted from the analysis.
