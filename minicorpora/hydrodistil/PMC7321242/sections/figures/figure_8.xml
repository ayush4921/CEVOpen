  <p>Representative histological analysis of tumors stained with hematoxylin and eosin and analyzed by optical microscopy. The asterisks indicate areas of necrosis. The negative control (CTL) was treated with a vehicle (5% DMSO) used to dilute EO, and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU, 10 mg/kg) was used as a positive control. Beginning 1 day after tumor implantation, the animals were treated intraperitoneally for 21 consecutive days.</p>
