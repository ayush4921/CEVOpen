  <p>Representative histological analysis of the lungs, livers and kidneys of the C.B-17 SCID mice with HepG2 cell xenografts treated with 
   <italic>Cyperus articulatus</italic> rhizome essential oil (EO). Lungs and livers were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and kidneys were stained with Periodic acid-Schiff, and all slides were analyzed by light microscopy. The negative control (CTL) was treated with a vehicle (5% DMSO) used to dilute EO. 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU, 10 mg/kg) was used as a positive control. Beginning 1 day after tumor implantation, the animals were treated intraperitoneally for 21 consecutive days. Asterisks indicate the areas of vascular congestion, thin arrows indicate coagulation necrosis and thick arrows represent hydropic degeneration.
