  <p>Effect of 
   <italic>Cyperus articulatus</italic> rhizome essential oil (EO) on the induction of cell death in HepG2 cells, as measured by flow cytometry using annexin V-FITC/PI staining. The negative control (CTL) was treated with a vehicle (0.5% DMSO) used to dilute EO, and doxorubicin (DOX, 1 µg/mL) was used as a positive control. Ten thousand events were evaluated per experiment, and cell debris was omitted from the analysis. The data are presented as the mean ± S.E.M. of three independent experiments carried out in duplicate. * 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 compared with the negative control by ANOVA, followed by the Student–Newman–Keuls test.
