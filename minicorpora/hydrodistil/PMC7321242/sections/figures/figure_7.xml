  <p>In vivo anti-liver-cancer effect of 
   <italic>Cyperus articulatus</italic> rhizome essential oil (EO) in C.B-17 severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice with HepG2 cell xenografts. (

   <bold>B</bold>) Tumor inhibition (%) after treatment. The negative control (CTL) was treated with a vehicle (5% DMSO) used to dilute EO, and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU, 10 mg/kg) was used as a positive control. Beginning 1 day after tumor implantation, the animals were treated intraperitoneally for 21 consecutive days. The data are presented as the mean ± S.E.M. of 10–20 animals. *
