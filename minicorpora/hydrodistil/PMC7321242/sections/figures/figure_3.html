 <caption> Representative flow cytometric histograms of the cell cycle distribution of HepG2 cells treated with Cyperus articulatus rhizome essential oil (EO). The negative control (CTL) was treated with a vehicle (0.5% DMSO) used to dilute EO, and doxorubicin (DOX, 1 Âµg/mL) was used as a positive control. Ten thousand events were evaluated per experiment, and cell debris was omitted from the analysis. </caption>
