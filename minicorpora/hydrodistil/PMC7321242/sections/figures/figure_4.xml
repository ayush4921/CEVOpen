  <p>Effect of 
   <italic>Cyperus articulatus</italic> rhizome essential oil (EO) on the cell cycle distribution of HepG2 cells after 24 (
   <bold>A</bold>), 48 (
   <bold>B</bold>) and 72 (
   <bold>C</bold>) h. The negative control (CTL) was treated with a vehicle (0.5% DMSO) used to dilute EO, and doxorubicin (DOX) was used as a positive control. The data are presented as the mean ± S.E.M. of three independent experiments carried out in duplicate. Ten thousand events were evaluated per experiment, and cell debris was omitted from the analysis. *
