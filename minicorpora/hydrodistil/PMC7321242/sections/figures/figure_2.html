 <caption> Effect of Cyperus articulatus rhizome essential oil (EO) on HepG2 cell morphology. The cells were stained with May-Grunwald–Giemsa and examined by optical microscopy (bar = 50 μm). The negative control (CTL) was treated with a vehicle (0.5% DMSO) used to dilute EO, and doxorubicin (DOX) was used as a positive control. The arrows indicate cell shrinkage or cells with nuclear condensation. </caption>
