 <caption> Tyrosinase inhibitory effect of the methanol (ME), water/methanol (HA), dichloromethane (DCM) and supercritical fluid (SFE) extracts, along with the essential oil (EO) of S. sipylea at 150 μg/mL. The values are the mean of three replicate determinations ± standard error. Kojic acid was used as a positive control at 150 μg/mL. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way ANOVA, and Dunnett’s test was employed to compare extracts with the positive control, with p &lt; 0.0001 (****). </caption>
