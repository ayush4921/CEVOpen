<p>Higher values of TPC are associated with a higher content of phenolic compounds in the plant extracts. The phenolic compounds have a fundamental role in the plant biology and defense mechanisms [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-25-02022" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. It is well-known that the organoleptic properties of the plant, such as taste, smell and flavor are being modified by phenolic compounds [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-25-02022" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Moreover, as mentioned above, they protect the plant from oxidative stress, microorganisms, and insects. A wide range of phenolic compounds was observed in the extracts. The EO obtained by HD and the non-polar fractions obtained by SFE and DCM contained much smaller amounts of phenolic compounds than the EtOAc, ME, and HA extracts. The comparative results concerning the whole spectrum of different extract polarities in
