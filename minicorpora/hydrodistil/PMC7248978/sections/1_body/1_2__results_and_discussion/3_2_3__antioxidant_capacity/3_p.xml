<p>Moreover, the scavenging activity of these extracts was determined based on their DPPH neutralization. The DPPH radical scavenging is a widely used method to evaluate the ability of plant extracts to scavenge free radicals, generated from DPPH reagent. The effective concentration to reduce the DPPH radical to 50% (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) (defined as the concentration of substrate that causes a 50% loss of DPPH activity), was determined by plotting a linear regression curve of DPPH activity versus the ratio of sample concentration to DPPH, as previously reported [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-25-02022" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The DPPH free radical scavenging effect of 
 <italic>S. sipylea</italic> extracts was in the following order: SFE &lt; DCM &lt; EO. The lowest value of IC
 <sub>50</sub> means a higher antioxidant potential of the plant extract. The most polar extracts (i.e., methanolic and hydroalcoholic) showed the lowest IC
 <sub>50</sub> values (0.115 for ME and 0.116 for HA), while the highest IC
 <sub>50</sub> value (0.202) and therefore the lowest antioxidant activity was presented for the essential oil (
