<p>Cellular oxidation is a complex biochemical condition induced by Reactive Oxygen Intermediates (ROI) and the byproducts generated from oxygen metabolism. The reactive species are derived from normal physiological and metabolic processes that are essential for the cell. In the plant kingdom, there are different compound classes that can act as antioxidants [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-25-02022" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Flavonoids, such as flavonols, flavones, flavanones, isoflavonoids, and anthocyanidins, among others, have the ability to effectively moderate the harmful effects of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS). Phenolic compounds constitute a well-known class of antioxidants in order to scavenge free radicals. The Total Phenolic Content (TPC) along with in vitro antioxidant activity assays, such as the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging of the endemic 
 <italic>S. sipylea</italic> in Turkey, has been previously reported, and, based on this study, the ME extract presented the highest TPC value, exceeding the respective value for the water extract [

 <italic>S. sipylea</italic> was not reported therein. A higher ratio of phenolic compounds is extracted in more polar solvents, and this can explain the higher TPC values. Moreover, it is known that the TPC in plants depends on various factors, such as extraction solvents, handling and plant genetics [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-25-02022" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. So, we further investigated the TPC values of the ME, HA, EtOAc, DCM, and SFE extracts along with the EO of 
 <italic>S. sipylea</italic>, by using the Folin–Ciocalteu method. TPC values were obtained from the calibration curve y = 0.0687x − 0.1348 with R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.9974, where x is the absorbance and y is the concentration of gallic acid solution (μg/mL) expressed as mg GAE/g of dry extract. The highest value of TPC was exhibited by the HA extract (104.98 ± 0.05 mg GAE/g), followed by the ME extract (101.51 ± 12.20 mg GAE/g), but with no significant difference between them (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.9536). All other values are presented in
