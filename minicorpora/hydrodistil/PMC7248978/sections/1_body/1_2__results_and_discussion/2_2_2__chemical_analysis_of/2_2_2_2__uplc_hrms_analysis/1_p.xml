<p>The chemical composition of the polar HA and ME extracts, together with the medium polar EtOAc extract of 
 <italic>S. sipylea</italic>, was identified on the basis of UPLC-ESI-HRMS
 <sup>n</sup> analysis, classifying the compounds into several chemical classes. The UPLC-HRMS chromatograms obtained by the analysis of the three extracts, using ESI(â€“) mode, are illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02022-f002">Figure 2</xref>. The major compounds detected were hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives, phenylethanoid glycosides, and flavonoids, including flavonoid-7-
 <italic>O</italic>-diglycosides and flavonoid acetylglycosides. The identified components of the three extracts are listed in
