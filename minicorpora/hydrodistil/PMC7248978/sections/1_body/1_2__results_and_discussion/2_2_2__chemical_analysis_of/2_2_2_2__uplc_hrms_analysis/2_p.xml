<p>Chromatographic and spectrometric features such as retention time, suggested molecular formula, Ring Double Bond equivalents (RDBeq), as well as fragmentation pattern were used to identify individual compounds. A total of 33 components were detected and tentatively identified. As is depicted in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-02022-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, a large number of phenolic compounds was detected, especially in the HA and ME extracts. Specifically, seven different phenylethanoid glycosides (

 <xref rid="B4-molecules-25-02022" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-25-02022" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] were identified, such as echinacoside, forsythoside B, verbascoside, samioside, isoverbascoside, allysonoside, and leucoseptoside A, with verbascoside having the highest intensity (

 <italic>O</italic>-methylisoscutellarein 7-
 <italic>O</italic>-allosyl- (1→2)-[6′′-
 <italic>O</italic>-acetyl]-glucoside having the highest intensity. Two iridoid glycosides, i.e., melittoside and its derivative, were detected mainly in the HA and ME extracts [

 <xref rid="B33-molecules-25-02022" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The presence of phenolic acids is limited to 6-
 <italic>O</italic>-caffeoyl-glucose, chlorogenic acid, and feruloylquinic acid. Chlorogenic acid has been previously identified as a component mainly present in
