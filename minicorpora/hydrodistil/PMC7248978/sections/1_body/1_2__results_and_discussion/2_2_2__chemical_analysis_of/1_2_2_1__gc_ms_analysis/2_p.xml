<p>Overall, 79 compounds were tentatively identified (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-02022-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) in the investigated DCM, EO, and SFE samples, representing the 79.43%, 83.32%, and 81.49% of the total peak area, respectively. Hydrocarbons were the most abundant compounds detected in all three non-polar extracts, with SFE presenting the highest amount (53.89%). This type of enrichment in hydrocarbon compounds, such as long-chain alkanes, may be explained, however, by the fact that the highest extraction yield (1.65%

 <italic>w</italic>) was observed in the case of SFE. Regarding the EO sample, sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, oxygenated sesquiterpenes, diterpene hydrocarbons, and oxygenated diterpenes were the major constituents (4.29%, 8.96%, 38.15%, and 29.80%, respectively). Monoterpene hydrocarbons such as α-pinene, β-pinene, sabinene, verbenol, and borneol were identified only in the DCM extract, representing a minor percentage (1.42%), unlike previous reports [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-25-02022" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-25-02022" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The bicyclic sesquiterpenes β-caryophyllene and caryophyllene oxide were present in all three different types of extracts (i.e., DCM, SFE, and EO), as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02022-f001">Figure 1</xref>, and have been investigated for potential activity as analgesic and anticancer agents [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-25-02022" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. These two bicyclic sesquiterpenes act as selective agonists of cannabinoid receptors (CB) and may exert a further use of 
 <italic>Sideritis</italic> essential oil as an analgesic agent; however, the mechanism of action needs to be clarified. The presence of spathulenol (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-02022">Figure S3</xref>) might be implicated in the reported antibacterial use of the essential oil from 
 <italic>S. sipylea</italic> [

 <xref rid="B29-molecules-25-02022" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Moreover, geranyl linalool that is present in DCM, SFE, and EO is a common fragrance ingredient used in dermo-cosmetics [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-25-02022" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Oxygenated diterpenes were the most abundant group of terpenoids detected in the 
 <italic>S. sipylea</italic> non-polar extracts, especially in DCM and SFE extracts. It is well known that Mediterranean 
 <italic>Sideritis</italic> spp. contain tetracyclic diterpenes of the 
 <italic>ent</italic>-kaurane type [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-25-02022" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Siderol, sideridiol, and 7-epicandicandiol were observed in all non-polar extracts of 
 <italic>S. sipylea</italic>. The biological importance of these kaurane diterpenes isolated from this endemic species, with the use of eco-friendly technologies such as SFE, is among the aspects that merit further research. The aforementioned extract is mainly characterized by long-chain hydrocarbons (44.04%) and oxygenated diterpenes (26.23%). Those data for 
 <italic>S. sipylea</italic> are reported here for the first time. It is worth noting that, in all previous research studies, we observed the phytochemical analysis of the essential oil of this endemic plant or the isolation of specific plant metabolites by employing solvent extraction and conventional chromatographic techniques [
