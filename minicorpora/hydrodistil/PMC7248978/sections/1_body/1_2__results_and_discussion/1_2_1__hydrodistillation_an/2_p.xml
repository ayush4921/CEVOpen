<p>As shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-02022-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, the use of UAE, specifically the water/methanol (HA) and methanol (ME) extracts, presented the highest yields, compared to the extracts of lower polarities and/or obtained by other techniques. Moreover, the extraction yield of SFE surpassed the respective yields for the dichloromethane (DCM) extract and essential oil (EO). SFE can be regarded as a green and convenient alternative to the traditional techniques to recover non-polar compounds from aromatic plants, such as
