<p>In order to obtain the volatile and other non-polar compounds, but also the polar constituents of 
 <italic>S. sipylea</italic>, three different techniques were utilized, in parallel. Specifically, hydrodistillation (HD) was employed for the recovery of the essential oil (EO), followed by supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), using supercritical CO
 <sub>2</sub> (sCO
 <sub>2</sub>), and ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) with four different solvents. The extracts obtained by applying the aforementioned techniques are summarized in
