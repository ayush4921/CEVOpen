 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02022-f005">Figure 5</xref>. Elastin is a highly elastic protein found in connective tissues and has a fundamental role in the tissue configuration. Side effects such as exposure to UV irradiation and oxidative damage upregulate the expression of elastase, a serine protease, which hydrolyzes the dermal elastin. This reduces skin elasticity and this effect may be associated with skin-aging. Inhibitors of elastase may have an anti-aging effect and their topical application to the surface of human skin may have beneficial effects, especially in the case of increased dryness [
