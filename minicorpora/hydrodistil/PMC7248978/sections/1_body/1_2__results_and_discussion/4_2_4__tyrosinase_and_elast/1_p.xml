<p>The inhibitory effect on tyrosinase of the two most polar ME and HA extracts, the non-polar DCM and SFE extracts, as well as the EO of 
 <italic>S. sipylea</italic> was investigated at five different concentrations. Tyrosinase is a key regulatory enzyme that catalyzes melanin synthesis within melanocytes. Therefore, tyrosinase inhibitors have become increasingly important in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals as whitening agents [
