<p>By investigating the anti-elastase activity of 
 <italic>S. sipylea</italic> extracts, all three non-polar extracts (DCM, SFE, and EO) showed an inhibitory effect on elastase (6.64, 10.87, and 12.84%, respectively) at 0.5 μg/mL, while the polar extracts ME and HA showed an inconsiderable effect (

 <italic>S. sipylea</italic> to help prevent skin ageing, by using it in healing oils. The moderate enzyme inhibition may have the potential to maintain skin elasticity. According to the GC-MS results, the EO of 
 <italic>S. sipylea</italic> is characterized by the presence of oxygenated compounds, including oxygenated sesquiterpenes and diterpenes. Such compounds have shown a moderate inhibition activity on the elastase enzyme explained by their direct binding with the enzyme [

However, in the present work we observed the inhibitory effect of the total EO, without considering the possible antagonism for the binding site, neither the synergistic effects of the compounds that may be responsible for the enzyme inhibition. Even if elastase inhibitory activity has been previously reported for the EtOH extract of 
 <italic>S. perfoliata</italic> [
 <xref rid="B51-molecules-25-02022" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], no elastase inhibition has been reported before for 
 <italic>S. sipylea</italic>.
