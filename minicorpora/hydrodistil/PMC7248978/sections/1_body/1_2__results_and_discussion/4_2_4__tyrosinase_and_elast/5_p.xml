<p>The results also suggest that tyrosinase inhibition positively correlates with TPC and DPPH free radical scavenging activity, suggesting that flavonoid compounds present in 
 <italic>S. sipylea</italic> are responsible for the tyrosinase inhibitory activity of the species. Furthermore, a correlation between the reduction in extract polarity and % elastase inhibition was observed at 500 Î¼g/mL. The EO at the same concentration presented the highest value (%) of elastase inhibition (20.28%). A reduction in elastase activity up to 70% has been observed for the essential oils having eugenol, cinnamaldehyde, and geraniol [

 <italic>S. sipylea</italic> are not only due to its major components but may also be due to synergistic effects with other minor components. Therefore, it can be argued that the EO of 
 <italic>S. sipylea</italic> is a potential inhibitor of proteolytic enzymes and can be used in dermo-cosmetic formulations. However, further studies are needed for its stability in aqueous solutions and its toxicity.
