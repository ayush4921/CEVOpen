<p>The tyrosinase inhibitory activity of the different extracts was enhanced with increasing concentration. The extracts examined show a maximum inhibition of ~26% at the concentration of 150 μg/mL, while the minimum percentage of inhibition is presented by the DCM extract with a value of ~11% (

 <italic>S. perfoliata,</italic> including acteoside (verbascoside), ajugoside, caffeic acid, leucoseptoside A, and martynoside, showed tyrosinase and/or melanin production inhibition activity [
