 <italic>Sideritis</italic> is a very common plant genus used in folk medicine and lately its extracts have become prevalent in many cosmetic formulations. Anti-aging and skin-whitening ingredients can be identified investigating different extracts of the endemic 
 <italic>Sideritis</italic> species for their tyrosinase and elastase inhibitory activity. Both enzyme tests can be very useful in the search for active natural cosmeceuticals. The experimental results confirm many of the ethnopharmacological uses of this endemic 
 <italic>Sideritis</italic> species, especially related to its biological properties, considering that, in the islands of the North Aegean Region wherein this species is grown (i.e., Lesvos, Chios, Ikaria, and Samos, Greece), it is commonly used as herbal tea. This study represents the first report on phytochemical composition, based on both GC-MS and UPLC-HRMS analyses, and the anti-aging and skin-whitening properties of 
 <italic>S. sipylea</italic>. Further experiments should be conducted, however, in order to isolate and identify specific bioactive compounds from this species, as well as to stabilize the efficacy of non-toxic doses of the extracts and isolated compounds. Moreover, future studies could possibly employ more samples collected throughout the North Aegean Region, in order to explore the correlation between different chemotypes, habitats, climatic and pedological conditions [
