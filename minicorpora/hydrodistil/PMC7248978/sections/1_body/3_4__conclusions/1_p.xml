<p>The overall aim of this study was to thoroughly investigate the total phytochemical profile and the biological activity of different extracts of the endemic and endangered species 
 <italic>Sideritis sipylea</italic> Boiss. Promising results were obtained with a view to find new active ingredients for cosmetic formulations in accordance to its well-known antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. These findings reinforce the ethnopharmacological use references for this species in Greece and Turkey, especially for the most polar extracts, such as the one obtained using water/methanol. Therefore, these fractions of 
 <italic>S. sipylea</italic> may be a novel source for the development of new dermo-cosmetic agents.
