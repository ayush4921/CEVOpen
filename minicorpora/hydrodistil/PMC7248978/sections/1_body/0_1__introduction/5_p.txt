0: Its essential oil (EO) has a characteristic and strong scent, most probably attributed to the monoterpenes contained [ 9].
1: As revealed by previous studies on  S. sipylea from Greece (i.e., Lesvos, Samos), the chemical composition of EO may vary according to the collection area [ 9, 23].
2: The EO of  S. sipylea from Lesvos has demonstrated in vitro antimicrobial activity against six bacteria and three pathogenic fungi, with stronger effects than those elicited by the EOs of  S. clandestina subsp.
3: clandestina and  S. raeseri subsp.
4: attica [ 9].
5: The in vitro antimicrobial potential of isolated compounds, mainly from the non-polar extracts (e.g., petroleum ether) of  S. sipylea aerial parts collected in Turkey, has also been reported [ 24, 25].
6: The most prominent effects were observed for kaurene diterpenes, such as 7-epicandicandiol.
7: Regarding the polar extracts of  S. sipylea, the methanolic extracts have shown comparatively strong antioxidant activity and high total phenolic content [ 26].
8: However, most studies so far have partially focused either on volatile/non-polar or polar extracts and constituents thereof, without providing further insight into the total chemical profile of this species and correlating it with different biological activities.
