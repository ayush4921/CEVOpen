<p>In continuation of our investigation on the ethnopharmacological properties of medicinal plants in the Greek islands of the North Aegean Region, we report herein the chemical profile of 
 <italic>S. sipylea</italic>, considering both polar and non-polar constituents. Different extraction methods, specifically hydrodistillation (HD), supercritical fluid chromatography (SFE) and ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE), were used, covering a wide range of polarities allowing at the same time a comparative study. For the analysis of the different extracts, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry (UPLC-HRMS) were utilized accordingly. Finally, we examined whether the extracts derived from 
 <italic>S. sipylea</italic> exhibit anti-tyrosinase and anti-elastase activity for the purpose of identifying anti-aging and skin-whitening properties, in addition to its well-known antioxidant capacity, investigating their potential to be used for dermo-cosmetic purposes.
