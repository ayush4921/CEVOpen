<p>The genus 
 <italic>Sideritis</italic> belongs to the Lamiaceae family and consists of more than 150 species worldwide [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-25-02022" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In countries of the Mediterranean, and especially in Greece, Italy, Spain, and Turkey, it is divided into 320 subspecies [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-25-02022" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In Greece, the genus comprises eight species and seven subspecies with reference to the Mountain Flora of Greece [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-25-02022" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. A key characteristic of this genus is the classification difficulty because of the strong tendency of its species to hybridize and thus changing their chemical composition [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-25-02022" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The phytochemical profile of 
 <italic>Sideritis</italic> species has been extensively analyzed and thus the chemotaxonomic markersâ€™ constituents of the genus, such as terpenoids, sterols, coumarins, flavonoid aglycones, and glycosides, are well known [
