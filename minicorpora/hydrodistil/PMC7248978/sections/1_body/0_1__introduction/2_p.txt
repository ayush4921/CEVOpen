0: Many species of the  Sideritis genus, such as  S. scardica,  S. clandestina,  S. syriaca,  S. raeseri, along with the endemic species  S. euboea and  S. sipylea, are commonly known as mountain tea or ironwort and have been widely used in traditional medicine, mainly as a decoction derived from the aerial parts.
1: Numerous in vitro studies have previously shown that extracts from the aerial parts of  Sideritis spp.
2: demonstrate anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antifeedant, antihyperglycemic, antiulcerative, gastroprotective, spasmolytic, and bone-remodeling properties [ 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13].
3: The aqueous extracts and volatile fractions from several species, including  S. sipylea, have also demonstrated activities related to the Central Nervous System (CNS), acting as GABA A receptor modulators [ 14, 15].
4: S. scardica has shown potential for the treatment of neurological disorders and neurodegenerative diseases [ 15], while together with  S. galatica,  S. lycia, and  S. stricta have been evaluated in vitro against Alzheimer and Parkinson disease [ 15, 16, 17].
