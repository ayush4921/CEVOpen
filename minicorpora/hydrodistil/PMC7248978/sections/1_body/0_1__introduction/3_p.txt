0: Numerous secondary metabolites, with a strong antioxidant capacity, such as phenolic acids, flavonoids, and kaurene diterpenes, have been isolated from different extracts of several  Sideritis species [ 2, 11].
1: Moreover, flavonoids, such as xanthomicrol, have demonstrated a selective cyclooxygenase activity and therefore an anti-inflammatory activity.
2: A strong structuralactivity relationship between the catechol group in the B ring of these flavonoids with the enzyme was found [ 18].
3: Anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity has also been observed for phenylpropanoid glycosides such as leucoseptoside, martynoside, and verbascoside, isolated from  Sideritis perfoliata [ 19].
4: Diterpenes isolated from the essential oils of  Sideritis spp.
5: have shown antimicrobial activity in vitro [ 20].
6: Furthermore, antifeedant activity was observed by  ent-kaurene diterpenes, such as sideroxol, linearol, and 7-epicandicandiol, isolated from the acetone extracts of different  Sideritis species [ 21].
