<p>Its essential oil (EO) has a characteristic and strong scent, most probably attributed to the monoterpenes contained [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-25-02022" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. As revealed by previous studies on 
 <italic>S. sipylea</italic> from Greece (i.e., Lesvos, Samos), the chemical composition of EO may vary according to the collection area [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-25-02022" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-25-02022" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The EO of 
 <italic>S. sipylea</italic> from Lesvos has demonstrated in vitro antimicrobial activity against six bacteria and three pathogenic fungi, with stronger effects than those elicited by the EOs of 
 <italic>S. clandestina</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>clandestina</italic> and 
 <italic>S. raeseri</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>attica</italic> [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-25-02022" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The in vitro antimicrobial potential of isolated compounds, mainly from the non-polar extracts (e.g., petroleum ether) of 
 <italic>S. sipylea</italic> aerial parts collected in Turkey, has also been reported [

 <xref rid="B25-molecules-25-02022" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The most prominent effects were observed for kaurene diterpenes, such as 7-epicandicandiol. Regarding the polar extracts of 
 <italic>S. sipylea</italic>, the methanolic extracts have shown comparatively strong antioxidant activity and high total phenolic content [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-25-02022" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, most studies so far have partially focused either on volatile/non-polar or polar extracts and constituents thereof, without providing further insight into the total chemical profile of this species and correlating it with different biological activities.
