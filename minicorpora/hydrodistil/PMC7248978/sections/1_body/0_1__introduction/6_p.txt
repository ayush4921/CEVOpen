0: In continuation of our investigation on the ethnopharmacological properties of medicinal plants in the Greek islands of the North Aegean Region, we report herein the chemical profile of  S. sipylea, considering both polar and non-polar constituents.
1: Different extraction methods, specifically hydrodistillation (HD), supercritical fluid chromatography (SFE) and ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE), were used, covering a wide range of polarities allowing at the same time a comparative study.
2: For the analysis of the different extracts, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry (UPLC-HRMS) were utilized accordingly.
3: Finally, we examined whether the extracts derived from  S. sipylea exhibit anti-tyrosinase and anti-elastase activity for the purpose of identifying anti-aging and skin-whitening properties, in addition to its well-known antioxidant capacity, investigating their potential to be used for dermo-cosmetic purposes.
