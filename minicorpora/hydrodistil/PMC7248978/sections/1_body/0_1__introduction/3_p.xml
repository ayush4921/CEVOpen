<p>Numerous secondary metabolites, with a strong antioxidant capacity, such as phenolic acids, flavonoids, and kaurene diterpenes, have been isolated from different extracts of several 
 <italic>Sideritis</italic> species [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-25-02022" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-25-02022" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Moreover, flavonoids, such as xanthomicrol, have demonstrated a selective cyclooxygenase activity and therefore an anti-inflammatory activity. A strong structuralâ€“activity relationship between the catechol group in the B ring of these flavonoids with the enzyme was found [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-25-02022" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity has also been observed for phenylpropanoid glycosides such as leucoseptoside, martynoside, and verbascoside, isolated from 
 <italic>Sideritis perfoliata</italic> [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-25-02022" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Diterpenes isolated from the essential oils of 
 <italic>Sideritis</italic> spp. have shown antimicrobial activity in vitro [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-25-02022" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Furthermore, antifeedant activity was observed by 
 <italic>ent</italic>-kaurene diterpenes, such as sideroxol, linearol, and 7-epicandicandiol, isolated from the acetone extracts of different 
 <italic>Sideritis</italic> species [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-25-02022" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].
