<p>The values are represented as mean ± SE (
 <italic>n</italic> ≥ 3) for all enzymatic bioassays, while, for DPPH and TPC assays, the results are reported as mean ± SD (
 <italic>n</italic> ≥ 3). By using one-way ANOVA, the occurrence of statistical differences among the data was evaluated. To compare samples with the positive control, multiple comparisons of means were performed using Dunnett’s test (
 <italic>p</italic> values of &lt; 0.05 (*), &lt; 0.01 (**), &lt; 0.001 (***), and &lt; 0.0001 (****), respectively); otherwise, means were separated using Tukey’s test (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). GraphPad Prism 6.01 (GraphPad Software Inc., California, CA, USA) software was used for all the analyses.
