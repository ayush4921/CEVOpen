0: The values are represented as mean  SE ( n  3) for all enzymatic bioassays, while, for DPPH and TPC assays, the results are reported as mean  SD ( n  3).
1: By using one-way ANOVA, the occurrence of statistical differences among the data was evaluated.
2: To compare samples with the positive control, multiple comparisons of means were performed using Dunnetts test ( p values of< 0.05 (*),< 0.01 (**),< 0.001 (***), and< 0.0001 (****), respectively); otherwise, means were separated using Tukeys test ( p< 0.05).
3: GraphPad Prism 6.01 (GraphPad Software Inc., California, CA, USA) software was used for all the analyses.
