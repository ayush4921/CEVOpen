<p>The dried aerial parts of 
 <italic>S. sipylea</italic> (10 g for each solvent) were extracted separately with dichloromethane (DCM), ethyl acetate (EtOAc), methanol (ME), and a mixture of distilled water/methanol (50:50 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) (HA). UAE was carried out within a PEX 3 Sonifier (REUS, Contes, France) of 3 L, composed of a stainless-steel reactor equipped with a double-layered mantle and a transducer operating at a frequency of 25 kHz, with a maximum input power of 150 W. The double-layered mantle allowed us to control the temperature of the medium by cooling with tap water. All extractions were performed in duplicate at ambient temperature, using 400 mL of solvent each time. After filtration, the collected extracts were concentrated to dryness and the residues were weighed, resulting in 0.112 g of DCM extract (1.12% 
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic>), 0.100 g of EtOAc extract (1.00% 
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic>), and 1.29 g of ME extract (12.90% 
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic>). The HA extract (1.46 g; 14.64 % 
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic>) was lyophilized using freeze-drying. All UAE extracts were stored at 4 Â°C until analysis and further use.
