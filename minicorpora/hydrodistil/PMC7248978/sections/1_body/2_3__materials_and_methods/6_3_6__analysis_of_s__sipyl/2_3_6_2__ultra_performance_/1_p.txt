0: UPLC-HRMS was employed with a view to investigate the chemical composition of  S. sipylea extracts obtained with solvents of high or medium polarity, i.e., HA, ME, and EtOAc extracts.
1: The analyses were performed using an Acquity H-Class UPLC system (Waters Corp., Milford, USA), equipped with a quaternary pump, an autosampler, an online vacuum degasser, and a temperature-controlled column and sample compartment, and hyphenated to a hybrid LTQ-Orbitrap Discovery XL (Thermo Scientific, Brehmen, Germany) mass spectrometer with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source.
2: Xcalibur 2.0.7 (Thermo Scientific) software was used for data acquisition and processing.
3: For all analyses, the samples were diluted at a concentration of 200 g/mL, using MeOH/H2O 60:40 ( v/ v) for both type of extracts.
4: A Fortis C 18 (Fortis Technologies Ltd., Cheshire, UK) column (100  2.1 mm, 1.7 m) was used with a mobile phase consisted of water (solvent A) and acetonitrile (solvent B), both containing 0.1% formic acid ( v/ v).
5: The gradient program was as follows: initially 5% (B) maintained for 3 min, then increased until reaching 100% (B) in 18 min, maintained at 100% (B) for 2 min, and finally decreased to 5% (B) in 2 min and held at the initial conditions (7 min) for re-equilibration, with a total run time of 32 min.
6: The flow rate was 0.4 mL/min, while the injection volume was 10 L. Column temperature was set at 40 C.
