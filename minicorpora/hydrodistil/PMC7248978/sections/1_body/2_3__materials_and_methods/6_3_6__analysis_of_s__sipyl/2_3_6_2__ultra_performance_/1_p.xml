<p>UPLC-HRMS was employed with a view to investigate the chemical composition of 
 <italic>S. sipylea</italic> extracts obtained with solvents of high or medium polarity, i.e., HA, ME, and EtOAc extracts. The analyses were performed using an Acquity H-Class UPLC system (Waters Corp., Milford, USA), equipped with a quaternary pump, an autosampler, an online vacuum degasser, and a temperature-controlled column and sample compartment, and hyphenated to a hybrid LTQ-Orbitrap Discovery XL (Thermo Scientific, Brehmen, Germany) mass spectrometer with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source. Xcalibur 2.0.7 (Thermo Scientific) software was used for data acquisition and processing. For all analyses, the samples were diluted at a concentration of 200 μg/mL, using MeOH/H2O 60:40 (

 <italic>v</italic>) for both type of extracts. A Fortis C
 <sub>18</sub> (Fortis Technologies Ltd., Cheshire, UK) column (100 × 2.1 mm, 1.7 μm) was used with a mobile phase consisted of water (solvent A) and acetonitrile (solvent B), both containing 0.1% formic acid (

The gradient program was as follows: initially 5% (B) maintained for 3 min, then increased until reaching 100% (B) in 18 min, maintained at 100% (B) for 2 min, and finally decreased to 5% (B) in 2 min and held at the initial conditions (7 min) for re-equilibration, with a total run time of 32 min. The flow rate was 0.4 mL/min, while the injection volume was 10 μL. Column temperature was set at 40 °C.
