<p>The chemical composition of 
 <italic>S. sipylea</italic> non-polar extracts, i.e., DCM, SFE, and EO, was determined by GC-MS. All analyses were carried out on a Finnigan Trace GC Ultra 2000 apparatus (Thermo Electron Corporation, USA), equipped with an AI 3000 autosampler. The GC system was coupled with a Finnigan Trace DSQ mass selective detector, operating with electron ionization in positive mode (70 eV) using the full scan mass range of

 <italic>z</italic> 40–400, while a Trace TR-5MS (Thermo Scientific, USA) capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d.; 0.25 μm film thickness) was used. The injector and detector temperatures were set at 220 and 260 °C, respectively. Helium was used as a carrier gas, at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. Diluted samples of 1 μL (2 mg/mL in DCM) were injected in splitless mode. The oven temperature was programmed to increase from 40 to 260 °C at a rate of 4 °C/min, and then held isothermally for 10 min; the total run time was 65 min. Xcalibur 2.0.7 software (Thermo Scientific) was used for the operation of the system as well as for data handling and processing. The retention indices (RI) of compounds were calculated according to the retention time of (C

 <italic>n</italic>-alkanes. Identification was based on the comparison of their RI with those previously reported and by matching their mass spectra with those of Wiley 2007 and NIST 2011 libraries or literature data [
