0: The TPC values of the different  S. sipylea extracts was determined using the FolinCiocalteu reagent, as previously described [ 57].
1: A total of 20 L of extract was added to a tube containing 1 mL distilled water, followed by the addition of 100 L of Folin-Ciocalteu reagent and incubation for 3 min at room temperature.
2: Subsequently, 280 L of 25%  w/ v sodium carbonate (Na 2CO 3) solution, along with 600 L of distilled water, was added to the mixture.
3: Finally, following 1 h incubation at room temperature in the dark, the absorbance was measured at 765 nm versus a blank lacking the extract.
4: The measurement was carried out on a Hitachi U-1900 radio beam spectrophotometer (serial no.
5: 2023029; Hitachi Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).
6: The optical density of the sample without the FolinCiocalteu reagent at 765 nm was also measured.
7: TPC was determined using a gallic acid standard curve (501500 g/mL) and is presented as g of gallic acid equivalents per mg of extract.
