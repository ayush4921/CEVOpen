<p>The TPC values of the different 
 <italic>S. sipylea</italic> extracts was determined using the Folin–Ciocalteu reagent, as previously described [
 <xref rid="B57-molecules-25-02022" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. A total of 20 μL of extract was added to a tube containing 1 mL distilled water, followed by the addition of 100 μL of Folin-Ciocalteu reagent and incubation for 3 min at room temperature. Subsequently, 280 μL of 25% 
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic> sodium carbonate (Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub>) solution, along with 600 μL of distilled water, was added to the mixture. Finally, following 1 h incubation at room temperature in the dark, the absorbance was measured at 765 nm versus a blank lacking the extract. The measurement was carried out on a Hitachi U-1900 radio beam spectrophotometer (serial no. 2023–029; Hitachi Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The optical density of the sample without the Folin–Ciocalteu reagent at 765 nm was also measured. TPC was determined using a gallic acid standard curve (50–1500 μg/mL) and is presented as µg of gallic acid equivalents per mg of extract.
