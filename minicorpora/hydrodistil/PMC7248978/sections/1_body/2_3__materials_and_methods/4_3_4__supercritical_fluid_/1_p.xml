<p>Extraction with supercritical carbon dioxide (SFE-CO
 <sub>2</sub>) was performed using laboratory-scale supercritical fluid equipment, model SFE 100 mL (SEPAREX, Champigneulles, France). The experiment was performed for 2 h by filling the stainless-steel extraction vessel (100 mL) with ca. 14 g of dried plant material. Extraction was carried out in duplicate using 100% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. The pressure in the extraction vessel was kept constantly at 300 bar, while the flow rate of CO
 <sub>2</sub> was 25 g/min. The extraction and separation temperatures were set at 40 and 35 °C, respectively. Subsequently, the valve was opened every 20 min to partially collect the extract. Finally, the extract obtained was stored at 4 °C until use. The extraction yield was estimated as 1.65% (
