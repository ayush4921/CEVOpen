0: Extraction with supercritical carbon dioxide (SFE-CO 2) was performed using laboratory-scale supercritical fluid equipment, model SFE 100 mL (SEPAREX, Champigneulles, France).
1: The experiment was performed for 2 h by filling the stainless-steel extraction vessel (100 mL) with ca.
2: 14 g of dried plant material.
3: Extraction was carried out in duplicate using 100% CO 2.
4: The pressure in the extraction vessel was kept constantly at 300 bar, while the flow rate of CO 2 was 25 g/min.
5: The extraction and separation temperatures were set at 40 and 35 C, respectively.
6: Subsequently, the valve was opened every 20 min to partially collect the extract.
7: Finally, the extract obtained was stored at 4 C until use.
8: The extraction yield was estimated as 1.65% ( w/ w) of the dried plant material.
