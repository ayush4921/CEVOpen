0: The porcine pancreatic elastase type IV (PPE), a lyophilized powder at 4 units/mg protein, was used for this bioassay.
1: ME and HA crude extracts of  S. sipylea were evaluated at concentrations of 500 g/mL (final concentration in the well).
2: PPE inhibition was tested according to a method described previously [ 59], using  n-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Ala- p-nitroanilide as a substrate, and monitoring the release of  p-nitroaniline.
3: The amount of  p-nitroaniline was determined spectrophotometrically at 405 nm.
4: The reaction mixture contained 80 L of Trizma-base buffer (50 mM, pH 7.5), 10 L of sample (500 g/mL in buffer) and 5 L of elastase.
5: The final solutions were incubated for 15 min at room temperature in the dark.
6: Afterwards, 15 L of 2 mM N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Ala- p-nitroanilide dissolved in Trizma buffer was added and the solutions were incubated for 30 min at 37 C. Elastatinal is used as a positive control (IC 50 = 0.5 g/mL).
7: All experiments were performed in triplicate and absorbance was measured using the Infinite  200 PRO plate reader.
8: The % inhibition of elastase was calculated by the formula Inhibition (%) = (A control  A sample) / A control)  100, where A control is the absorbance of the solution containing the buffer, elastase, the sample solvent and the substrate at 405 nm, and A sample is the absorbance of the buffer, elastase, sample or elastinal and substrate mixture at 405 nm.
9: For each sample, a blank experiment was performed.
