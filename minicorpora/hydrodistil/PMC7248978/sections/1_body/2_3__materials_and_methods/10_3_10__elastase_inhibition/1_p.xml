<p>The porcine pancreatic elastase type IV (PPE), a lyophilized powder at ≥4 units/mg protein, was used for this bioassay. ME and HA crude extracts of 
 <italic>S. sipylea</italic> were evaluated at concentrations of 500 μg/mL (final concentration in the well). PPE inhibition was tested according to a method described previously [
 <xref rid="B59-molecules-25-02022" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], using 
 <italic>n</italic>-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Ala-
 <italic>p</italic>-nitroanilide as a substrate, and monitoring the release of 
 <italic>p</italic>-nitroaniline. The amount of 
 <italic>p</italic>-nitroaniline was determined spectrophotometrically at 405 nm. The reaction mixture contained 80 μL of Trizma-base buffer (50 mM, pH 7.5), 10 μL of sample (500 μg/mL in buffer) and 5 μL of elastase. The final solutions were incubated for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. Afterwards, 15 μL of 2 mM N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Ala-
 <italic>p</italic>-nitroanilide dissolved in Trizma buffer was added and the solutions were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Elastatinal is used as a positive control (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.5 μg/mL). All experiments were performed in triplicate and absorbance was measured using the Infinite
 <sup>®</sup> 200 PRO plate reader. The % inhibition of elastase was calculated by the formula Inhibition (%) = (A
 <sub>control</sub> − A
 <sub>sample</sub>) / A
 <sub>control</sub>) × 100, where A
 <sub>control</sub> is the absorbance of the solution containing the buffer, elastase, the sample solvent and the substrate at 405 nm, and A
 <sub>sample</sub> is the absorbance of the buffer, elastase, sample or elastinal and substrate mixture at 405 nm. For each sample, a blank experiment was performed.
