0: All extracts of  S. sipylea were evaluated at 150 g/mL (final concentration in the well).
1: The capacity of the samples to inhibit the catalytic action of tyrosinase in the oxidation of L-DOPA to dopachrome was determined by an enzymatic method, as described previously [ 58].
2: The activity of tyrosinase was measured at 475 nm using the Infinite  200 PRO plate reader.
3: The inhibitory potency of the samples against this enzyme was compared with that of the positive control, kojic acid (IC 50 = 495.5 M), known as a strong tyrosinase inhibitor.
4: In a 96-well microplate, 40 L of the tested sample (dissolved in the PBS buffer from 1.5 to 0.3 mg/mL) and 40 L of mushroom tyrosinase were mixed and incubated for 10 min at room temperature avoiding light exposure.
5: Then, 40 L of 2.5 mM L-DOPA dissolved in buffer was added and the measurement of dopachrome formation at 475 nm was done.
6: The final DMSO concentrations did not exceed 5% of the total volume.
7: The inhibition percentage was calculated as follows: Inhibition (%) = [((A control  A controls blank)  (A sample  A samples blank)) / (A control  A controls blank)]  100, where A control is the absorbance of the mixture of buffer, tyrosinase, sample solvent, and substrate and A sample is the absorbance of the mixture of buffer, tyrosinase, samples or kojic acid solution, and substrate.
