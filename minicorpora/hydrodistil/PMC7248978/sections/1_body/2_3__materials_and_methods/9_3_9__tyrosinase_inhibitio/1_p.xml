<p>All extracts of 
 <italic>S. sipylea</italic> were evaluated at 150 μg/mL (final concentration in the well). The capacity of the samples to inhibit the catalytic action of tyrosinase in the oxidation of L-DOPA to dopachrome was determined by an enzymatic method, as described previously [
 <xref rid="B58-molecules-25-02022" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The activity of tyrosinase was measured at 475 nm using the Infinite
 <sup>®</sup> 200 PRO plate reader. The inhibitory potency of the samples against this enzyme was compared with that of the positive control, kojic acid (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 495.5 μM), known as a strong tyrosinase inhibitor. In a 96-well microplate, 40 μL of the tested sample (dissolved in the PBS buffer from 1.5 to 0.3 mg/mL) and 40 μL of mushroom tyrosinase were mixed and incubated for 10 min at room temperature avoiding light exposure. Then, 40 μL of 2.5 mM L-DOPA dissolved in buffer was added and the measurement of dopachrome formation at 475 nm was done. The final DMSO concentrations did not exceed 5% of the total volume. The inhibition percentage was calculated as follows: Inhibition (%) = [((A
 <sub>control</sub> − A
 <sub>control’s blank</sub>) − (A
 <sub>sample</sub> − A
 <sub>sample’s blank</sub>)) / (A
 <sub>control</sub> − A
 <sub>control’s blank</sub>)] × 100, where A
 <sub>control</sub> is the absorbance of the mixture of buffer, tyrosinase, sample solvent, and substrate and A
 <sub>sample</sub> is the absorbance of the mixture of buffer, tyrosinase, samples or kojic acid solution, and substrate.
