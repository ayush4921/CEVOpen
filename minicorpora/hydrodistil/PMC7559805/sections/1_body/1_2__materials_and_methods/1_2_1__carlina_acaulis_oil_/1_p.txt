0: One kg of dry roots of  C. acaulis obtained from A. Minardi and Figli S.r.l.
1: (48012 Bagnacavallo RA, Italy), was firstly crushed using a shredder (Albrigi, mod.
2: E0585, Stallavena, Verona, Italy), for then being put into a 10 L round flask with 6 L of distilled water.
3: The roots were then subjected to hydrodistillation using a Clevenger-type apparatus for 8 h and using a heating system consisting of a Falc MA mantle (Falc Instruments, Treviglio, Italy).
4: The EO, which showed a pale orangish colour, was obtained in a 0.4% yield ( w/ w).
5: After the hydrodistillation process, the EO was decanted and separated from the aqueous layer, then dehydrated with an hydrous Na 2SO 4.
6: Finally, it was collected in a vial closed with a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)/silicone cap and kept at 20 C until chemical analysis and subsequent biological assays.
7: For the chemical characterization of the  C. acaulis EO, the analysis was conducted using an Agilent 6890N gas chromatograph furnished of a single quadrupole 5973N mass spectrometer and an auto-sampler 7863 (Agilent, Wilmingotn, DE).
8: The column used for the separation was an HP-5 MS capillary column (30 m length, 0.25 mm i.d., 0.1 m film thickness; 5% phenylmethylpolysiloxane), supplied by Agilent (Folsom, CA, USA).
9: The column was allowed to reach initially a temperature of 60 C for 5 min, then it was raised up to 200 C at 4 C/min and finally to 280 C at 11 C/min for 15 min.
10: The temperature of the injector and detector was set at 280 C. The mobile phase used was constituted of 99.9% of He, with a flow of 1 mL/min.
11: Before injection, the EO was diluted 1:100 in  n-hexane, and then 1 L was injected in split mode (1:50).
12: The peak acquisition was achieved with electron impact (EI, 70 eV) mode in the range 29400  m/z.
13: The chromatograms obtained were analysed using the MSD ChemStation software (Agilent, Version G1701DA D.01.00) and the NIST Mass Spectral Search Program for the NIST/EPA/NIH EI and NIST Tandem Mass Spectral Library v. 2.3.
14: The retention index (RI) was calculated using a mix of  nalkanes (C 7C 30, Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy), using the Vanden Dool and Kratz formula [ 72].
