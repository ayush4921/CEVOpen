<p>One kg of dry roots of 
 <italic>C. acaulis</italic> obtained from A. Minardi and Figli S.r.l. (48012 Bagnacavallo RA, Italy), was firstly crushed using a shredder (Albrigi, mod. E0585, Stallavena, Verona, Italy), for then being put into a 10 L round flask with 6 L of distilled water. The roots were then subjected to hydrodistillation using a Clevenger-type apparatus for 8 h and using a heating system consisting of a Falc MA mantle (Falc Instruments, Treviglio, Italy). The EO, which showed a pale orangish colour, was obtained in a 0.4% yield (

 <italic>w</italic>). After the hydrodistillation process, the EO was decanted and separated from the aqueous layer, then dehydrated with an hydrous Na
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>. Finally, it was collected in a vial closed with a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)/silicone cap and kept at −20 °C until chemical analysis and subsequent biological assays. For the chemical characterization of the 
 <italic>C. acaulis</italic> EO, the analysis was conducted using an Agilent 6890N gas chromatograph furnished of a single quadrupole 5973N mass spectrometer and an auto-sampler 7863 (Agilent, Wilmingotn, DE). The column used for the separation was an HP-5 MS capillary column (30 m length, 0.25 mm i.d., 0.1 μm film thickness; 5% phenylmethylpolysiloxane), supplied by Agilent (Folsom, CA, USA). The column was allowed to reach initially a temperature of 60 °C for 5 min, then it was raised up to 200 °C at 4 °C/min and finally to 280 °C at 11 °C/min for 15 min. The temperature of the injector and detector was set at 280 °C. The mobile phase used was constituted of 99.9% of He, with a flow of 1 mL/min. Before injection, the EO was diluted 1:100 in 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane, and then 1 µL was injected in split mode (1:50). The peak acquisition was achieved with electron impact (EI, 70 eV) mode in the range 29–400 
 <italic>m/z</italic>. The chromatograms obtained were analysed using the MSD ChemStation software (Agilent, Version G1701DA D.01.00) and the NIST Mass Spectral Search Program for the NIST/EPA/NIH EI and NIST Tandem Mass Spectral Library v. 2.3. The retention index (RI) was calculated using a mix of 
 <italic>n</italic>–alkanes (C
 <sub>7</sub>–C
 <sub>30</sub>, Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy), using the Vanden Dool and Kratz formula [
