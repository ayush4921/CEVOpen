<p>The insecticidal activity of EO and NE of 
 <italic>C. acaulis</italic> on 
 <italic>L. botrana</italic> was tested adapting the method by Bosch et al. [
 <xref rid="B76-nanomaterials-10-01867" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] originally developed for insecticide toxicity assessment on 
 <italic>C. pomonella</italic>. A 32 μL-drop of NE or EO formulation was deposited on the surface of a piece of semi-synthetic diet (4 × 4 × 1 cm) using a micropipette. The solution was evenly distributed using a humidified brush and allowed to dry for 2 h. Sixteen 1st instar larvae (L1) of 
 <italic>L. botrana</italic> were deposited on each piece of diet and individualized within a gelatine capsule (00, Fagron, Quarto Inferiore, Bologna, Italy). Each piece of the diet with the larvae was placed in a closed plastic box to avoid desiccation.
