0: The insecticidal activity of EO and NE of  C. acaulis on  L. botrana was tested adapting the method by Bosch et al.
1: [ 76] originally developed for insecticide toxicity assessment on  C. pomonella.
2: A 32 L-drop of NE or EO formulation was deposited on the surface of a piece of semi-synthetic diet (4  4  1 cm) using a micropipette.
3: The solution was evenly distributed using a humidified brush and allowed to dry for 2 h. Sixteen 1st instar larvae (L1) of  L. botrana were deposited on each piece of diet and individualized within a gelatine capsule (00, Fagron, Quarto Inferiore, Bologna, Italy).
4: Each piece of the diet with the larvae was placed in a closed plastic box to avoid desiccation.
