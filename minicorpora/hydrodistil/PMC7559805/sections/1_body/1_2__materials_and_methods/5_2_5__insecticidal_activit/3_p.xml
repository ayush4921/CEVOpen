<p>To validate the method described above, we also tested positive and negative controls. The positive control was a commercial insecticide, Spinosad (Laser
 <sup>®</sup>, Dow) tested at the tab dose (15 mL/hL); the negative control was 0.17% Polysorbate 80 + 99.83% of H
 <sub>2</sub>O for NE and H
 <sub>2</sub>O + dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at the same concentration of the EO. At least three replicas for each concentration of EO, NE, positive and negative control were performed. For each tested product concentration, four duplicate trials were carried out; replicates were conducted over different days to account for any daily variability. Each concentration was always replicated with a new concentration series prepared for each replicate. All experiments were performed at laboratory conditions of 22 ± 1 °C, R.H. 45 ± 5%, and photoperiod 16:8 (L:D).
