0: To validate the method described above, we also tested positive and negative controls.
1: The positive control was a commercial insecticide, Spinosad (Laser , Dow) tested at the tab dose (15 mL/hL); the negative control was 0.17% Polysorbate 80 + 99.83% of H 2O for NE and H 2O + dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at the same concentration of the EO.
2: At least three replicas for each concentration of EO, NE, positive and negative control were performed.
3: For each tested product concentration, four duplicate trials were carried out; replicates were conducted over different days to account for any daily variability.
4: Each concentration was always replicated with a new concentration series prepared for each replicate.
5: All experiments were performed at laboratory conditions of 22  1 C, R.H. 45  5%, and photoperiod 16:8 (L:D).
