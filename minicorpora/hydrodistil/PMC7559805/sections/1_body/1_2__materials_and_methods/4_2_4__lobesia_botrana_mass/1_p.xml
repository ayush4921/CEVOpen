 <italic>Lobesia botrana</italic> young instars tested in our bioassays were from a laboratory mass-rearing kept at the Entomology lab, University of Pisa. Adults were reared inside a plastic bottle and fed with a liquid diet. Eggs were collected every 2 days and placed into a plastic tray, previously drilled to allow airflow; each tray contained a piece of artificial food medium. Semi-synthetic larval diet is based on Gabel et al. [

The rearing was maintained at a temperature of 25 ± 1 °C, R.H. 70 ± 10% and 16:8 (L:D) photoperiod.
