0: Lobesia botrana young instars tested in our bioassays were from a laboratory mass-rearing kept at the Entomology lab, University of Pisa.

2: Eggs were collected every 2 days and placed into a plastic tray, previously drilled to allow airflow; each tray contained a piece of artificial food medium.
