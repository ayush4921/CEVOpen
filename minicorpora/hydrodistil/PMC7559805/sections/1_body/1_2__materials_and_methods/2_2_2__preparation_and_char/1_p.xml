 <italic>Carlina acaulis</italic> EO-based NE was obtained through a high-energy method by using a high-pressure homogenizer. It was prepared according to the procedure reported by Rosi Cappellani et al. [
 <xref rid="B73-nanomaterials-10-01867" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Briefly, 6% (

 <italic>C. acaulis</italic> EO was added dropwise to a 4% (

 <italic>w</italic>) of surfactant (Polysorbate 80, Sigma-Aldrich) aqueous solution under high-speed stirring (Ultraturrax T25 basic, IKA
 <sup>Â®</sup> Werke GmbH and Co.KG, Staufen, Germany) for 5 min at 9500 rpm. The obtained emulsion was then subjected to homogenization by means of a French Pressure Cell Press (American Instrument Company, AMINCO, Silver Spring, MD, USA) for four cycles at the pressure of 130 MPa.
