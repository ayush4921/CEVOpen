<p>Particle size measurements were carried out through dynamic light scattering (DLS) analyses by using a Zetasizer nanoS (Malvern Instrument, Malvern, UK) equipped with a backscattered light detector working at 173°. One mL of the sample was inserted into a disposable cuvette and analysed at 25 °C, following a temperature equilibration time (180 s).</p>
