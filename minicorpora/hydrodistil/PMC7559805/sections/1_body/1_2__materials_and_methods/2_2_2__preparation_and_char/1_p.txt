0: Carlina acaulis EO-based NE was obtained through a high-energy method by using a high-pressure homogenizer.
1: It was prepared according to the procedure reported by Rosi Cappellani et al.
2: [ 73].
3: Briefly, 6% ( w/ w) of  C. acaulis EO was added dropwise to a 4% ( w/ w) of surfactant (Polysorbate 80, Sigma-Aldrich) aqueous solution under high-speed stirring (Ultraturrax T25 basic, IKA  Werke GmbH and Co.KG, Staufen, Germany) for 5 min at 9500 rpm.
4: The obtained emulsion was then subjected to homogenization by means of a French Pressure Cell Press (American Instrument Company, AMINCO, Silver Spring, MD, USA) for four cycles at the pressure of 130 MPa.
