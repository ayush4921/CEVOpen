0: Lobesia botrana mortality (%) was arcsine transformed before performing an analysis of variance (ANOVA, two factors as fixed effects) followed by Tukeys honestly significant difference (HSD) test ( p< 0.05).
1: The experimental mortality was corrected with Abbotts formula, if control mortality ranged from 1 to 20%; if control mortality was > 20% experiments were discarded and repeated [ 77].
2: LC 10, LC 30, LC 50, and LC 90 with associated 95% confidence interval (CI) and chi-squares, were estimated using probit analysis [ 78].
3: JMP 9 (SAS) software was used for all analyses, and  p = 0.05 was selected as a threshold to assess significant differences.
