 <italic>Lobesia botrana</italic> mortality (%) was arcsine√ transformed before performing an analysis of variance (ANOVA, two factors as fixed effects) followed by Tukey’s honestly significant difference (HSD) test (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The experimental mortality was corrected with Abbott’s formula, if control mortality ranged from 1 to 20%; if control mortality was &gt; 20% experiments were discarded and repeated [
