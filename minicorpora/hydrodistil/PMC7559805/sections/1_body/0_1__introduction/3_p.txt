0: EOs are mixtures of plant metabolites, mainly monoterpenoids, sesquiterpenoids, and phenylpropanoids [ 14]; their insecticidal, acaricidal and nematocidal properties make them excellent alternatives to synthetic insecticides [ 14, 15, 16].
1: EOs are often characterized by two or three main compounds at high concentrations (2085%) and other molecules at trace levels.
2: A mechanism of action of EOs involves the inhibition of P450 cytochromes (i.e., these cytochromes are responsible for phase I metabolism of xenobiotics); other modes of actions include the neurotoxic activity-modulating octopaminergic system, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors and inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE) [ 14].
