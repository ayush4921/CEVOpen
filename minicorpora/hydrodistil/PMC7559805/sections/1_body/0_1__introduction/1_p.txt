0: The European grapevine moth (EGVM),  Lobesia botrana (Denis & Schiffermuller, 1775) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), is a widespread and economically important pest of the grapevine worldwide.
1: EGVM larvae feed on grape bunches ( Vitis vinifera L.), reducing yield and increasing susceptibility to fungal and bacterial infections (i.e., botrytis and sour rot) [ 1].
