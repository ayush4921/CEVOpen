0: As defined by Nikam et al.
1: [ 39], NEs are kinetically stable biphasic dispersions of two immiscible liquids: either water-in-oil (W/O) or oil-in-water (O/W) droplets stabilized by an amphiphilic surfactant; in this way, protection from the surrounding environment, suitable spreading, and penetration of the bioactive molecules are guaranteed by the matrix and low surface and interfacial tension [ 40].
2: Toxicity of EO-based NEs was tested on several insects of agricultural and medical interest such as aphids [ 41, 42, 43], mosquitoes [ 44, 45, 46], stored-product beetles [ 47, 48], and some Lepidoptera [ 49, 50, 51].
3: Furthermore, it was also highlighted that the bioactivity of EO-based NEs was often higher compared to the EOs themselves [ 52, 53, 54].
