<p>As defined by Nikam et al. [
 <xref rid="B39-nanomaterials-10-01867" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], NEs are kinetically stable “biphasic dispersions of two immiscible liquids: either water-in-oil (W/O) or oil-in-water (O/W) droplets stabilized by an amphiphilic surfactant”; in this way, protection from the surrounding environment, suitable spreading, and penetration of the bioactive molecules are guaranteed by the matrix and low surface and interfacial tension [
