 <italic>Carlina acaulis</italic>, also called “piccolo cardo”, is a perennial herb growing on the mountainous soils of central Europe, up to 2000 m of altitude [

 <xref rid="B61-nanomaterials-10-01867" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], this plant has been largely used in the European tradition as a remedy against several diseases [

 <xref rid="B64-nanomaterials-10-01867" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Nowadays, its traditional use is still recognised in many European countries as a tonic, diuretic, anti-oedematous, anticancer, and antibiotic agent, and for the treatment of gastritis and cold [

 <italic>C. acaulis</italic> is also described in the Italian list of botanicals to be used in food supplements [
 <xref rid="B69-nanomaterials-10-01867" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] and in the BELFRIT (Belgium France Italy) list [
 <xref rid="B70-nanomaterials-10-01867" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. The EO obtained from the roots of this plant revealed as a major constituent (&gt;90%) the polyacetylene 2–(3–phenylprop–1–yn–1–yl)–furan, also known as carlina oxide. The biological activities shown by this EO are noteworthy, but its innovative insecticidal potential is attracting the interest of the agrochemical industry.
