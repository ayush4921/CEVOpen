0: Even though EOs represent promising BP ingredients, their use in Integrated Pest Management (IPM) programs is still scarce because their physico-chemical properties (i.e., poor water solubility, scarce stability, high volatility, thermal decomposition, and oxidative degradation) make them difficult to handle in field conditions.
1: A solution to these difficulties is to coat or entrap EOs into a matrix.
2: The encapsulation process enhances physico-chemical stability, prevents degradation of active agents, and improves the bioavailability of EOs [ 36, 37].
3: Nanotechnology represents a suitable strategy to carry the EOs active principles, overcoming their physiochemical limitations; the small size of nano-systems increases active ingredients spreading, deposition, permeation, and provides controlled release on the target site.
4: Among nano-delivery systems, nanoemulsions (NEs) represent an efficient, low-priced, and safe way to carry EOs [ 38].
