<p>EOs are mixtures of plant metabolites, mainly monoterpenoids, sesquiterpenoids, and phenylpropanoids [

 <xref rid="B16-nanomaterials-10-01867" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. EOs are often characterized by two or three main compounds at high concentrations (20â€“85%) and other molecules at trace levels. A mechanism of action of EOs involves the inhibition of P450 cytochromes (i.e., these cytochromes are responsible for phase I metabolism of xenobiotics); other modes of actions include the neurotoxic activity-modulating octopaminergic system, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors and inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE) [
