0: EOs repellence [ 17, 18], larvicidal [ 19, 20, 21], and insecticidal activities are proven on different arthropod pests of economic importance [ 22, 23, 24, 25].
1: Among them, the EOs efficacy has also been investigated on some Lepidoptera.
2: Good examples are represented by  Cydia pomonella (Linneaus) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) [ 26],  Thaumetopoea pityocampa (Denis & Schiffermuller) (Lepidoptera: Notodontidae) [ 27],  Cadra cautella (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) [ 28] as well as  Spodoptera littoralis (Boisd.)
3: [ 29, 30, 31] and  Spodoptera litura (Fabr.)
4: (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) [ 32, 33, 34].
5: However, current knowledge about EOs toxicity on  L. botrana larvae is strictly limited [ 35].
