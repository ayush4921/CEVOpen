<p>The present study highlighted the promising potential of the 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>acaulis</italic> root EO as an effective ingredient for botanical insecticide development. This EO showed high insecticidal efficacy against 1st instar larvae of 
 <italic>L. botrana</italic>, a major pest affecting grape cultivation, causing yearly significant economic damages. Moreover, this research supported the real-world applications of the 
 <italic>C. acaulis</italic> EO through its encapsulation into a nanoformulation. The EO-based NE guarantees the conservation of the insecticidal activity while ensuring dispersibility in the environment as well as its stability along time. Although the results encourage the use of 
 <italic>C. acaulis</italic> EO in the agricultural field, especially in organic farming, further investigations are needed to evaluate its eco-toxicological profile. Similarly, further studies are needed to reveal the effects of lethal and sub-lethal concentrations on fertility, longevity, and behaviour of 
 <italic>L. botrana</italic>.
