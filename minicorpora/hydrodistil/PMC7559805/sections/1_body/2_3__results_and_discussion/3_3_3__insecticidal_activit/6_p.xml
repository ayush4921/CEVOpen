<p>This study opens a new perspective on 
 <italic>L. botrana</italic> management using botanical pesticides. It highlights the potential of Asteraceae EOs as valid alternatives to chemical insecticides, because of their low human toxicity, rapid degradation, low environmental impact, and reduced likelihood to trigger insecticide resistance [

 <xref rid="B95-nanomaterials-10-01867" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. The lack of physico-chemical stability makes EOs difficult to handle in open field conditions. However, the adoption of nano-delivery systems (e.g., NEs) increases EOs stability and solubility, improving their delivery, and establishing a sustained release of the active ingredients [
