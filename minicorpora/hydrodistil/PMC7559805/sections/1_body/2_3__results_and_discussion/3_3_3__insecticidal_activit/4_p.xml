<p>The comparison of the LC values obtained by testing 
 <italic>C. acaulis</italic> EO and the corresponding NE, showed a comparable larvicidal activity. From the values reported in 
 <xref rid="nanomaterials-10-01867-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, it is possible to observe a higher insecticidal activity of the pure EO (LC
 <sub>90</sub> = 10.922 ± 1.40 µL/mL) over the NE (LC
 <sub>90</sub> = 17.706 ± 4.48 µL/mL). On the other hand, the NE contains 6% of EO, a value 16 times lower respect to pure EO used as reference. This shows that the EO encapsulated in the NE is more active than the pure 
 <italic>C. acaulis</italic> EO, if considered at the same concentration. The increase in the larvicidal activity of pure EO encapsulated into the NE could be attributed to a better interaction between the active substance and the target site. First, the NE, providing a greater dispersion of the lipophilic substance (EO) in the aqueous phase, allows the diffusion of the EO in the 
 <italic>L. botrana</italic> growth environment. Furthermore, the NE is able to increase the concentration of the EO at the interface, leading to a better and direct interaction with the biological components of the target. Moreover, the small size and large surface area of the NE-encapsulated EO droplets allow an increased absorption and cellular penetration into the target site. Therefore, the encapsulated EO can exert its larvicidal activity even at lower concentrations than pure EO. Finally, the NE appears promising in controlling the growth of 
 <italic>L. botrana</italic>, not only for the larvicidal potential but also for the improvement of the physico-chemical properties and stability of the EO [
