<p>It is difficult to compare our results with the findings by other authors as, to the best of our knowledge, research on the insecticidal efficacy of plant EOs against 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>botrana</italic> is extremely limited. Only one study was retrieved, where Avgin et al. [
 <xref rid="B35-nanomaterials-10-01867" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] tested 5 essential oils from seeds or aerial parts of aromatic plants such as 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> L., 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> x 
 <italic>piperita</italic> L., 
 <italic>Foeniculum vulgare</italic> Mill., 
 <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> L. and 
 <italic>Carum carvi</italic> L. on field-collected grapes. The authors found that the EO from 
 <italic>C. carvi</italic> was the most effective, since at a concentration of 25 µL on 20 g of grapes it achieved &gt;96% mortality on 
 <italic>L. botrana</italic> larvae. Most research about the EO efficacy on 
 <italic>L. botrana</italic> was undertaken to explore any changes in adults’ behaviour in response to EO aroma [
 <xref rid="B88-nanomaterials-10-01867" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>], aimed at using EOs to improve pest control strategies [
 <xref rid="B89-nanomaterials-10-01867" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. As far as we know, our study is the first that assesses EO efficacy on the mortality of freshly hatched 
 <italic>L. botrana</italic> larvae as the usual target of insecticide application. Also, the study of EO-based NE efficacy on the larvae of phytophagous lepidopteran species is only beginning, and few papers on NE efficacy on moth pests exist so far [

 <xref rid="B51-nanomaterials-10-01867" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], although EOs have been known to provide very good insecticidal effects on pests including phytophagous moth larvae [

 <xref rid="B27-nanomaterials-10-01867" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Moreover, as indicated by previous studies, EO-based NEs actually show very promising effects, often significantly higher if compared to EOs [
