 <italic>Carlina acaulis</italic> EO was obtained from roots of carline thistle, and its main component is carlina oxide (~94%), one of the oldest known polyacetylenes. A recent study conducted by Benelli et al. [
 <xref rid="B56-nanomaterials-10-01867" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] proved carlina oxide as a mild acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor. It has also been documented that polyacetylenes cause phototoxicity in insects [
 <xref rid="B90-nanomaterials-10-01867" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>], and are able to modulate GABA
 <sub>A</sub> receptors [
 <xref rid="B91-nanomaterials-10-01867" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Recently, the effectiveness of 
 <italic>C. acaulis</italic> EO has been demonstrated on other insect species, showing acute and sub-lethal toxicity on highly important pests and vectors, such as the southern house mosquito, 
 <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> (Say) (Diptera: Culicidae) (LC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.31 μg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) [
 <xref rid="B56-nanomaterials-10-01867" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] and the common housefly, 
 <italic>Musca domestica</italic> (L.) (Diptera: Muscidae) (LC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.74 (♂) and 5.96 (♀) μg fly
 <sup>−1</sup>) [
 <xref rid="B71-nanomaterials-10-01867" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Moreover, simulating a small-scale maize conservation environment, the 
 <italic>C. acaulis</italic> EO led to relevant insecticidal activity against 
 <italic>Prostephanus truncatus</italic> (Horn) (Coleoptera: Bostrychidae), with 500 ppm killing &gt;97% of adult beetles within three days [
 <xref rid="B55-nanomaterials-10-01867" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Either the effectiveness, as well as the availability and low costs of the 
 <italic>C. acaulis</italic> EO, encourage further experimentation on EGVM for green pesticide development.
