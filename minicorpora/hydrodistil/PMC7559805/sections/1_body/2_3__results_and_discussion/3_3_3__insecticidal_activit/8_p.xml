<p>As mentioned above, the use of EOs to eliminate insects is an alternative pest control method that minimises any harmful effects on the environment. Since EOs are chemicals commonly found in nature, being contained in almost all vascular plants, and have been shown to be very friendly to non-target organisms, botanical insecticides based on EOs can be considered relatively safe for the environment [

 <xref rid="B94-nanomaterials-10-01867" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. Moreover, as EOs are highly volatile, only minimal problems with their residues are expected when used in soil and aquatic ecosystems [
