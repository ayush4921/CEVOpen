<p>The efficacy of EOs including EO-based NEs may not be necessarily related only to acute or chronic toxicity, but, as already shown, even sub-lethal EO doses or concentrations may reduce the vitality, fertility, and longevity of insects [

 <xref rid="B93-nanomaterials-10-01867" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>] including harmful moths [

 <xref rid="B28-nanomaterials-10-01867" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. This phenomenon was also confirmed for the EO from 
 <italic>C. acaulis</italic>, although for other insect species [

 <xref rid="B71-nanomaterials-10-01867" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] and, therefore, any potential effect of sub-lethal concentrations should be studied for 
 <italic>L. botrana</italic> as well. Similarly, the possibility of enhancing the insecticidal activity of the EO from 
 <italic>C. acaulis</italic> using a suitable synergistic mixture with other EOs or their major constituents should be considered in further studies.
