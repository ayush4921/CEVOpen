<p>Further studies should be conducted on the larvicidal and adulticidal activity of EOs and EO-based NEs on 
 <italic>L. botrana</italic> to find a valid substance to test in the open field. Moreover, as highlighted by Pavoni et al. [
 <xref rid="B79-nanomaterials-10-01867" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>], it is crucial to consider that a lot of EO-based NEs contain several, non eco-friendly ingredients (i.e., polysorbates). Thus, further research is needed to evaluate the effects of nano-encapsulation on EO toxicological profiles.
