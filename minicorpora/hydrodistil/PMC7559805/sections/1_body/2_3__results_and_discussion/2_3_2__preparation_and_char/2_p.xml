<p>However, NEs are energetically disadvantaged nanosystems because they have a higher free energy level respective to that of the two separated phases (water + oil). Thus, to produce a colloidal system, an external energetic input is required to overcome the activation energy barrier separating the two phases. In this respect, one of the most commonly used methods is the homogenization process. It is a high-energy method that consists of a 2-step procedure [
 <xref rid="B83-nanomaterials-10-01867" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. The first step gives rise to an emulsion, characterized by oil droplets mainly in the micrometric range, through the high-speed stirring process of the oil and water phases [

The second step, the high-pressure homogenization, provides the breakage of oil droplets into small ones by forcing the material to flow through small nozzles or valves by exerting very high pressures with a piston pump. During the flow, the emulsion is exposed to shear stress able to give rise to nanometric oily droplets [
