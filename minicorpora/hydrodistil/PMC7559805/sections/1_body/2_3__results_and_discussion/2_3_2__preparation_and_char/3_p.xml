<p>For the achievement of 
 <italic>C. acaulis</italic> EO-based NE, the sample was subjected to a pressure of 130 MPa four times. The sample showed a monomodal size distribution with a size in the nanometric range. In particular, the droplets’ population had a mean diameter centred around 140 nm (

The Z-average value or Z-average mean used in DLS is a parameter, also known as the cumulants mean, that can be defined as the “harmonic intensity averaged particle diameter”. Assuming that the particle population is a simple Gaussian distribution, the Z-average is the mean, and the PDI is related to the width of this simple distribution. Thus, the smaller the PDI (≤ 0.3), the more monodispersed the system will be [
