<p>The 
 <italic>C. acaulis</italic> EO NE showed optimal stability at room temperature, evaluated for a storage period of six months. As reported in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-01867-f002">Figure 2</xref>, the size of the oil droplets remained almost unchanged, with a slight shift of mean hydrodynamic diameter from 143.9 nm at t0 to 170.2 nm after 6 months. These results proved the thermodynamic stability of the system. It was also confirmed by the accelerated stability test, generally used to predict the thermodynamic stability of the system for long-term periods. The accelerated stability was evaluated via centrifugation, heating–cooling cycles, and finally, freeze-thaw cycles stress tests. The NE showed a good physical stability at the centrifugal forces (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-01867-f003">Figure 3</xref>B) and remained almost unaltered to the heat–cool cycles. No signs of creaming, phase separation or cracking were detected (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-01867-f003">Figure 3</xref>C). These images were also corroborated by DLS analysis results (
 <xref rid="nanomaterials-10-01867-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), that revealed the conservation of the internal phase structure, being the Z-average and PDI values almost unchanged with respect to those of the NE at t0. A slight creaming effect was observed when the NE was frozen at the temperature of −21 °C. However, its homogeneity was recovered upon the thawing phase (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-01867-f003">Figure 3</xref>D). A similar result was reported by Ammar et al. [
 <xref rid="B86-nanomaterials-10-01867" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>], who attributed this transient instability to the low temperature leading to the coagulation of the internal phase. This perturbation of the systems was revealed by the increased value of the Z-average after the freeze-thaw cycles, as reported in 
 <xref rid="nanomaterials-10-01867-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. However, the size of the oil phase was kept below 200 nm, which is the upper limit generally established by authors for NEs [
