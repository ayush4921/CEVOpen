<p>The drying data exhibited the weights of rosemary herbs after different periods of natural drying in the shade at room temperature. One week of drying showed a substantial reduction (65%) in the weights of the initial fresh herb from 200 g to 70 g. However, the weight reductions between the two- and the three-week dryings were insignificant (

The amount of volatile oils obtained from the fresh plant (200 g) by hydrodistillation was 198 ± 3.45 mg, as compared to 327 ± 5.91, 168.7 ± 5.11, and 97.8 ± 1.27 mg of the volatile oils obtained from the dried herbs of 70, 68, and 68 g weights after one, two, and three weeks of natural dryings, respectively. The oil weight reduction between the first and second week was about 48.4%, while for the third week, it was ~22% of losses as compared to the second week dried herbs (

Moreover, the notable increases in the volatile oil yields after one-week of the natural shade-drying of the herb as compared to the fresh, two-, and three-weeks dried herbs oils were ~40%, 48%, and 70%, respectively, thus indicating the economic benefits of the one-week drying procedure for the best production yields of the oils from rosemary. Based on the observations, the one-week drying procedure could be recommended for small and large-scale productions of rosemary’s volatile oils through the hydrodistillation process.
