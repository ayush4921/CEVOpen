<p>Among all the components of the oils, 1, 8-cineole, camphor, and α-terpineol—together with β-caryophyllene, camphene, β-pinene, citronellol, bornyl acetate, and linalool—were the major components in all the batches of oils obtained from fresh and differently-timed dried herbs. Additionally, 1,8-cineole, camphor, and α-terpineol were the major components that constituted about 28.59%, 20.96%, and 8.92% of the fresh herbs-based oil and 24.12%, 19.64%, and 9.01% of the one-week dried herbs extracted oils, respectively (significant differences of these constituents in the fresh and one-week dried herbs showed only for 1,8-cineole with
