<p>The up and down changes in the componential ratios of the oil constituents of all the dried herbs concerning the fresh herbs-based oil, as shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-02830-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> in the absence of any chemical or physical treatments of the herbs batches, can be attributed to biotransformations of various oil constituents during the dryings, especially in the extended two- and three-weeks dryings of the herbs. Volatile oil components are the most sensitive plant constituents to plant-drying programs [

 <xref rid="B29-molecules-25-02830" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Furthermore, the chemical reactivity and medicinal properties of any particular plant/herb may vary because of these factors of drying methods and drying periods as intended for oil procurement [

 <xref rid="B27-molecules-25-02830" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-25-02830" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] from any of the extraction procedures. Biochemical oxidation, reduction, and acetylation are the major chemical transformations occurring during the drying processes. The biotransformation reactions seem to be undertaken during the drying times for the rosemary herbs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02830-f002">Figure 2</xref>). It is a known fact that borneol is oxidized by borneol dehydrogenase to camphor [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-25-02830" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], while camphor gets converted to its reduced form, borneol [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-25-02830" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The bioconversions of camphor to bornyl acetate and isobornyl acetate; borneol oxidation to bornyl acetate; and 
 <italic>cis</italic>-verbenol, and isobornyl formate oxidations to bornyl acetate are some of the examples of biotransformations. Accordingly, the steady increase in the percentages of bornyl acetate at the outset may be linked to a decrease in the percentage of camphor in different oil samples with an increase in the drying times of the herbs (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-02830-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Furthermore, some of the identified components in fresh and one-week dried rosemary oil samples were absent in the two- and three-weeks-dried samples. The isobornyl acetate, myrcene, and α- and β-phellandrene could be bio-converted to other components due to their absence in these periods dried herbs’ oils. A closer look at the oil yields and their componential ratios between the fresh herbs and one-week dried herbs-based oils exhibited the presence of major components in nearly comparable yields with a significant decrease in 1,8-cineole and camphor yields proportions, while other constituents were either at par or at increased levels in their yields in the one-week dried herbs-based oil. The relationship of the componential yields and biotransformation with the interplay of drying periods on the oil contents and quality was a complex relationship. Nonetheless, the significant increase of bornyl acetate from 1.24% and 2.34% in the oil obtained from fresh and one-week dried herbs to 12.25% and 12.46% in the oil obtained after the two- and three-weeks drying periods was remarkable and was accompanied by the significant steady-decreasing order of camphor with the extending drying of the herb (

 <xref rid="molecules-25-02830-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). These marked changes in the oil batch constituents pointed to the definite biotransformation taking place during the drying hours. These ongoing observations also led to the conclusion that the yields and componential ratios of the oil constituents in the present case of rosemary oils were dependent on the drying periods whereby all other factors of temperature, mode of heating, condensation apparatus cooling gradient, the duration of extraction, and the presence of water in the extraction assembly were kept same.
