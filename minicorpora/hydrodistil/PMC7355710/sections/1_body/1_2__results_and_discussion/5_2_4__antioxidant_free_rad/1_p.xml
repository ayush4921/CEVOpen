<p>There are several reports on the antioxidant activity of rosemary oil gathered by various methods [

 <xref rid="B34-molecules-25-02830" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The antioxidant DPPH-based reactive values were used as a comparative factor for estimating the quality of oils obtained through various drying periods with a changed spectrum of its componential constituents. The DPPH-reactivity of the oils obtained from rosemary samples after various drying periods, together with the fresh herbs, indicated the oil compositions-based anti-oxidant behavior due to the presence and absence of the various constituents in the different batches of oils. The results shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02830-f003">Figure 3</xref> indicate the moderate DPPH-scavenging activity of the rosemary oil. They revealed that the antioxidant activity of the 
 <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> volatile oil increased proportionally with the increase in the natural drying periods of the herb, which is an indication of the accumulation of antioxidant products through biotransformation. Moreover, the anti-oxidant activity for the three-weeks dried herb-based oil did not significantly differ compared to the two-week dried herb-based oil at all the measured concentrations with comparable antioxidant activity at 0.625 and 2.5 mg/mL, respectively (

Likewise, the comparable anti-oxidant activity of the fresh and one-week dried herbs-based oils at 0.0312 and 0.625 mg/mL, respectively, are also noteworthy. The highest anti-oxidant activities of all the batches of oils were at 32%, 41%, 46%, and 51% inhibitions (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) of the DPPH radicals at 5 mg/mL concentrations for the fresh and one-, two-, and three-week dried herb-based oils, respectively. Again, the DPPH test responses from the fresh and one-week dried herbsâ€™ oils were altogether different and at significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) lower levels than the two- and three-weeks dried herbs-based oils. It is noteworthy that the significant compositional differences between the two and three weeks oils and the fresh and one-week dried herbs-based oils were in the oil batches containing a major presence of bornyl acetate in two- and three-weeks dried herbs-based oils (fresh, one, two, and three weeks oils: 1.42%, 2.24%, 12.25%, and 12.46%). In comparison, the ratio of the yields of the camphor decreased in the two- and three-weeks dried herbs-based oils (fresh, one, two, and three weeks oils: 20.96%, 19.64%, 12.09%, and 13.84%), which seems to be an apparent reason for higher anti-oxidant activity of the two- and three-weeks dried herbs-based oils.
