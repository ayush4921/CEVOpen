<p>The 
 <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> Linn., commonly known as rosemary, is an evergreen worldwide cultivated herbaceous plant belonging to the family Lamiaceae [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-25-02830" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Rosemary has economic values owing to its medicinal properties and culinary usage, and it is frequently used in confectionery, perfumery [

 <xref rid="B3-molecules-25-02830" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and food preservatives, especially meat [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-25-02830" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Commercially, rosemary and its oil are highly-prized [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-25-02830" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The plant is also available as dried herbs, with herbalists selling the aromatic and medicinal plants together with its oil in the community pharmacy. The herb acts as a remedy in treating several day-to-day common health-problems such as stomach ache, common cold, and cough [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-25-02830" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The plant is still in use in folk medicine for the symptomatic relief of inflammation of joints, as a diuretic, and in the management of diabetes and cardiovascular disorders [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-25-02830" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Besides, the plant’s volatile oil is traditionally used as a pain-killer, carminative, antispasmodic, and for treatments of renal colic. The herb essential oils and extracts have also been used as cholagogue, expectorant, and hair growth [

The rosmarinic acid, and diterpenes such as carnosic acid, carnosol, and rosmanol, in addition to other non-volatile triterpenic constituents, with promising broad-spectrum biological activities, as betulinic and ursolic acids are found in the herb [

 <xref rid="B10-molecules-25-02830" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The earlier investigations also reported significant differences in the herb’s volatile oil constituents following the particular habitat of the plant variety, confirming the geographically-distributed different genotypes or the chemotypical variations [

 <xref rid="B14-molecules-25-02830" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The similar phenotypical plant pool of rosemary herbs provides altered oil yields with different proportions and the presence of constituents in oils, purely owing to different conditions of extractions, e.g., hydro- and steam-distillations, supercritical fluid, supercritical CO
 <sub>2</sub> extractions, and water microwave-assisted hydrodistillation [

The camphor and 1,8-cineole, the two major volatile oil constituents of rosemary herbs, are present in all plant varieties of chemo/pheno-typic, and genotypic plant variations. The yields of these constituents were significantly affected by the change of extraction methods within the similar pheno/chemo-typic plants. The camphor yields percentage increased from 12.6% to 19.7% in water distillation over the steam-distillation process, while the proportions of 1,8-cineole obtained from the steam-distillation process decreased from 52.4% to 31.9% with the change of oil extraction methodology from steam- to hydro-distillation [
