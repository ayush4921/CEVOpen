1: A fused silica capillary column ZB5 (60 m  0.32 mm i.d.
2: 0.25 m film thickness) was used.
3: The oven temperature was maintained initially at 50 C and programmed from 50 to 240 C at a rate of 3 C/min.
4: The helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.1 mL/min.
5: The injector and detector temperatures were 220 and 250 C, respectively.
