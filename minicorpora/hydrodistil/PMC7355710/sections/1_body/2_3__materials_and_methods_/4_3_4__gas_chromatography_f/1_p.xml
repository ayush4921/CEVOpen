<p>The GC analysis was performed on a Perkin Elmer Auto System XL equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID). A fused silica capillary column ZB5 (60 m × 0.32 mm i.d. × 0.25 μm film thickness) was used. The oven temperature was maintained initially at 50 °C and programmed from 50 to 240 °C at a rate of 3 °C/min. The helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.1 mL/min. The injector and detector temperatures were 220 and 250 °C, respectively. </p>
