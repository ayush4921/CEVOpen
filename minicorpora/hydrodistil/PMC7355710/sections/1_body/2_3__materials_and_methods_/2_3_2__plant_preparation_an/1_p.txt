0: Fresh rosemary herbs were equally divided into twelve weight groups of 200 g each.
1: The first group (3  200 g, fresh herbs) was cut into small pieces by scissors and subjected to hydrodistillation using Clevengers apparatus in three cycles (200 g each) to isolate its volatile oil contents.
2: The second groups herbs materials (3  200 g), obtained after one week of natural drying (at room temperature and natural atmospheric pressure under standard laboratory conditions) in the shade were also cut into smaller pieces and subjected to hydrodistillation.
3: Likewise, the third (3  200 g) and fourth (3  200 g) groups herbs materials were also subjected to hydrodistillation after the similar drying conditions for two and three weeks, respectively.
4: The hydrodistillation procedures were conducted for 5 h for each cycle, and the results summarized in  Table 1.
5: All the obtained oils were dried by passing through anhydrous sodium sulfate, weighed, and stored at 20 C.
