0: The antioxidant activity of different oil batches was determined by the DPPH method [ 38].
1: Quercetin was used as a standard.
2: Briefly, 0.5 mL of the rosemarys volatile oils, in a concentration ranging from 5 to 0.0312 mg, was added to 1.5 mL of a DPPHmethanol solution at a concentration of 100 M (quercetin was used as a standard in the same concentration [ 39, 40]).
3: The mixtures were then vortexed and set aside in the dark for 30 min before being measured at the 517 nm wavelength by a UVVIS spectrophotometer.
4: The inhibition of free radical DPPH (I%) was calculated by the formula: I% = (A blankA sample)/A blank  100.
5: The independent measurements were conducted in triplicate, and the standard error was calculated.
