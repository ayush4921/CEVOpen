0: The essential oil constituents obtained from fresh rosemary and naturally dried samples were identified based on the experimental retention index ( RI) calculated in comparison to a series of n-alkenes (C 8C 40) and a retention index obtained from the literature under similar GC experimental conditions.
1: The identification of the compounds was carried out based on retention time, mass fragmentation patterns, and mass spectral libraries (National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST-11) and Wiley Database).
2: The relative percentages of the constituents was calculated from the area under the peak obtained from the GC-FID chromatogram.
