<p>The essential oil constituents obtained from fresh rosemary and naturally dried samples were identified based on the experimental retention index (
 <italic>RI</italic>) calculated in comparison to a series of n-alkenes (C
 <sub>8</sub>â€“C
 <sub>40</sub>) and a retention index obtained from the literature under similar GC experimental conditions. The identification of the compounds was carried out based on retention time, mass fragmentation patterns, and mass spectral libraries (National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST-11) and Wiley Database). The relative percentages of the constituents was calculated from the area under the peak obtained from the GC-FID chromatogram.
