<p>The GC–MS analysis was performed on Shimadzu GCMS-QP 2010 (Kyoto, Japan) equipped with an Rtx-5MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d. × 0.25 µm film thickness) (Restek, Bellefonte, PA, USA) according to the reported procedure [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-25-02830" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The oven temperature was kept at 50 °C for 3 min (isothermal) and programmed to 300 °C at 5 °C/min, and then it was kept constant at 300 °C for 10 min (isothermal); the injector temperature was 280 °C. The helium was used as a carrier gas with a constant flow rate set at 1.37 mL/min. Diluted samples (1%
