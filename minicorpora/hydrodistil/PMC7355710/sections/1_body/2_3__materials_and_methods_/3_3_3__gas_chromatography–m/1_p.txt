0: The GCMS analysis was performed on Shimadzu GCMS-QP 2010 (Kyoto, Japan) equipped with an Rtx-5MS capillary column (30 m  0.25 mm i.d.
1: 0.25 m film thickness) (Restek, Bellefonte, PA, USA) according to the reported procedure [ 37].
2: The oven temperature was kept at 50 C for 3 min (isothermal) and programmed to 300 C at 5 C/min, and then it was kept constant at 300 C for 10 min (isothermal); the injector temperature was 280 C. The helium was used as a carrier gas with a constant flow rate set at 1.37 mL/min.
3: Diluted samples (1%  v/ v) were injected with a split ratio of 15:1, and the injected volume was one L. The MS operating parameters were as follows: interface temperature: 280 C; ion source temperature: 220 C; and EI mode: 70 eV; and scan range: 35500 amu.
