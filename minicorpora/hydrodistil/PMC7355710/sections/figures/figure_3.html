 <caption> The antioxidant activity levels of rosemary oils agent DPPH-stable free radical tests for the fresh herbs (zero dryings), one-week, two-weeks, and the three-weeks dried herbs oil’s DPPH reactivity. The statistical significance of the two-way ANOVA was p &lt; 0.0001. Tukey’s multiple comparisons were then performed for all the different concentrations. Different letters within the same concentration denote significant differences among the groups according to Tukey’s test ( p &lt; 0.01). </caption>
