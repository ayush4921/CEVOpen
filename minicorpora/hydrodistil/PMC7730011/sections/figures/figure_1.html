 <caption> Biofilm formation in the presence of non-concentrated hydrolates ( a) and concentrated hydrolates ( b). Bars represent standard deviation, n = 3. H HD—hydrolate obtained by hydrodistillation; H SD—hydrolate obtained by steam distillation; H HD_SPE—hydrolate obtained by hydrodistillation and 50× concentrated using solid phase extraction (SPE); H SD_SPE—hydrolate obtained by steam distillation and 50× concentrated using SPE. Red lines—biofilm formation of strains in water ( a), biofilm formation of strains in extraction solvent ( b); values above/below the red lines—increased/reduced biofilm formation due to hydrolate presence. </caption>
