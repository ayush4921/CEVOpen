  <p>Biofilm formation in the presence of non-concentrated hydrolates (
   <bold>a</bold>) and concentrated hydrolates (
   <bold>b</bold>). Bars represent standard deviation, 
   <italic>n</italic> = 3. H
   <sub>HD</sub>—hydrolate obtained by hydrodistillation; H
   <sub>SD</sub>—hydrolate obtained by steam distillation; H
   <sub>HD_SPE</sub>—hydrolate obtained by hydrodistillation and 50× concentrated using solid phase extraction (SPE); H
   <sub>SD_SPE</sub>—hydrolate obtained by steam distillation and 50× concentrated using SPE. Red lines—biofilm formation of strains in water (
   <bold>a</bold>), biofilm formation of strains in extraction solvent (
   <bold>b</bold>); values above/below the red lines—increased/reduced biofilm formation due to hydrolate presence.
