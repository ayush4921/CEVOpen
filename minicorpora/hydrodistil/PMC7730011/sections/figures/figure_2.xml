  <p>Dynamic monitoring of cytotoxic response to different concentrations of the hydrolates concentrated by SPE. A549 cells were treated with selected concentrations of (
   <bold>a</bold>) lavender, (
   <bold>b</bold>) fennel, (
   <bold>c</bold>) bay leaves and (
   <bold>d</bold>) clove concentrated hydrolates. Cells treated with 0.1%, 0.4% and 0.8% ethanol were used as vehicle control and 5% DMSO treated cells were as positive control. Arrow showing time-point of treatment. Cell index values over 72 consecutive treatment hours were normalized to the time point of treatment.
