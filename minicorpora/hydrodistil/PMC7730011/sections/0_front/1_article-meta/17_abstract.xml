  <italic>nobilis</italic> L. were analyzed by gas chromatography with flame ionization detector (GC-FID) and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Additionally, the hydrolates were evaluated for antimicrobial activity (disk-diffusion and microdilution method), influence on biofilm formation (Christensen method) and cytotoxicity of concentrated hydrolates against human cell lines (A549) by xCELLigence system. Using chemical analysis, 48, 9, 13 and 33 different components were detected in lavender, clove, fennel and laurel hydrolates, respectively. Lavender hydrolate contained the largest proportion of 1,8-cineol, linalool furanoxide, and linalool. The main components of laurel hydrolate were 1,8-cineol, 4-terpineol and Î±-terpineol. Fenchone and estragole were the most abundant in fennel hydrolate, and eugenol and eugenyl acetate in clove hydrolate. Concentrated hydrolates showed significant antimicrobial activity. Clove hydrolate was among the most antimicrobially active agents, most preferably against

In the presence of the non-concentrated hydrolates, significantly reduced biofilm formation was observed; however, with concentrated clove hydrolate, there was an increase in biofilm formation, e.g., of
