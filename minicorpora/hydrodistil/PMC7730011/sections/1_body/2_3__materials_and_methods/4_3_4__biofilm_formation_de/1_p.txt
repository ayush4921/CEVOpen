0: Biofilm formation in the presence of hydrolates obtained from lavender, bay leaves, clove, and fennel was monitored in flat-bottomed microtiter plates (SPL Life Sciences, Pocheon-si, South Korea) as previously described by Silhova-Hruskova [ 75], with modifications.
1: Briefly, the strain cultured in brain heart infusion broth (BHI; Himedia, India) was prepared at a final cell concentration of 10 7 CFUmL 1.
2: After incubation at 30 C for 24 h under aerobic conditions, the microtiter plate was washed with sterile distilled water and dried.
3: Biofilm fixation was performed with 2% sodium acetate (15 min) and biofilm-forming cells were stained with 100 L of 1% crystal violet (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA).
4: After 15 min of staining, the plate was repeatedly washed and dried.
5: Thereafter, the biofilm-associated violet was solubilized with 96% ethanol and the absorbance of the solution was measured in a new plate at 595 nm (Infinite M200, Tecan, Mannedorf, Switzerland).
