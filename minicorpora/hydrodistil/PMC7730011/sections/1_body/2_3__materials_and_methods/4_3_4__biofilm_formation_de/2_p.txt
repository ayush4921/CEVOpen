0: In addition, the influence of ethanol (used for SPE concentration of hydrolates) was monitored in order to determine the real effect of the tested hydrolates on biofilm formation, as ethanol also affects biofilm activity.
1: The experiments were performed as above, but just in the presence of ethanol.
2: The biofilm formation in the presence of ethanol is presented by red lines in  Figure 1b.
