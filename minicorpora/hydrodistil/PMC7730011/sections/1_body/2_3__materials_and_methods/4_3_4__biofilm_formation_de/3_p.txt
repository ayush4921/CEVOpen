0: There were 8 wells in each experiment, and the experiments were independently repeated three times.
1: The obtained values were statistically evaluated using Excel 2010 (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA) and Statistica 12 (StatSoft, Tulsa, OK, USA).
2: Extreme values were tested with the DeanDixon test, and all remoteness values were excluded with 95% probability.
3: Median and standard deviations were determined from the remaining values.
4: A possible source of error resulting from insufficient dye washing, and resulting in an increase in absorbance, was also considered, and absorbance values that were too high compared to other measured values were excluded.
