<p>GC-MS analysis of the obtained extracts was carried out with a GC 2010 Gas Chromatograph, GCMS-QP2010 Plus Mass Selective Detector (both Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) and Combi Pal Autosampler (CTC Analytics, AG, Zwingen, Swizerland). The GC was equipped with an SLB-5ms capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm, 2.5 μm film thickness; Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA). Helium 5.0 (Linde, Praha, Czech Republic) was used as the carrier gas at a constant flow rate of 30 cm·s
 <sup>−1</sup>. The GC oven temperature was programmed as follows: initial temperature of 40 °C for 3 min, then heated up to 250 °C at 2 °C·min
 <sup>−1</sup>. The injector temperature was set to 200 °C. Then, 1 µL of extract was injected with a split ratio of 1:50. Mass spectrometry was run in electron ionization mode (EI) at 70 eV, in which ions with m/z 33–500 were scanned. Ion source and interface temperatures were set to 200 °C.
