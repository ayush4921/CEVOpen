0: GC-MS analysis of the obtained extracts was carried out with a GC 2010 Gas Chromatograph, GCMS-QP2010 Plus Mass Selective Detector (both Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) and Combi Pal Autosampler (CTC Analytics, AG, Zwingen, Swizerland).
1: The GC was equipped with an SLB-5ms capillary column (30 m  0.25 mm, 2.5 m film thickness; Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA).
2: Helium 5.0 (Linde, Praha, Czech Republic) was used as the carrier gas at a constant flow rate of 30 cms 1.
3: The GC oven temperature was programmed as follows: initial temperature of 40 C for 3 min, then heated up to 250 C at 2 Cmin 1.
4: The injector temperature was set to 200 C. Then, 1 L of extract was injected with a split ratio of 1:50.
5: Mass spectrometry was run in electron ionization mode (EI) at 70 eV, in which ions with m/z 33500 were scanned.
6: Ion source and interface temperatures were set to 200 C.
