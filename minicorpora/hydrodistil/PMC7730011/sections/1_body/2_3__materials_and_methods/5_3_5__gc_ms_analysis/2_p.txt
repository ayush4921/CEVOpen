0: Mass spectral identification was performed by comparing mass spectra with the commercial mass spectral databases NIST14 Mass Spectral Library and FFNSC library (GC-MS Flavor & Fragrance Natural & Synthetic Compounds Library).
1: Experimental results of retention indices were additionally compared with published data (Adams, 2007; Linstrom and Mallard, 2001) and data from FFNSC.
2: Retention indices were calculated according to the van den Dool and Kratz method, using a standard solution of  n-alkanes (C8C33) at concentrations of 100200 gmL 1, dissolved in  n-hexane (Restek, Bellefonte, PA, USA).
