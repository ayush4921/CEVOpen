<p>Mass spectral identification was performed by comparing mass spectra with the commercial mass spectral databases NIST’14 Mass Spectral Library and FFNSC library (GC-MS Flavor &amp; Fragrance Natural &amp; Synthetic Compounds Library). Experimental results of retention indices were additionally compared with published data (Adams, 2007; Linstrom and Mallard, 2001) and data from FFNSC. Retention indices were calculated according to the van den Dool and Kratz method, using a standard solution of 
 <italic>n</italic>-alkanes (C8–C33) at concentrations of 100–200 µg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>, dissolved in 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane (Restek, Bellefonte, PA, USA).
