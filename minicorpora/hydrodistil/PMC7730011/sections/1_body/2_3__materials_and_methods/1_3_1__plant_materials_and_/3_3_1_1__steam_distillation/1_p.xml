<p>Steam distillation was performed in a steam distillation system. The distillation flask was connected to a cylindrical body containing the plant material. The hydrolate was prepared as follows: the appropriate amount of plant material was weighed into the cylindrical body. Then, 1500 mL of deionized water was placed into the 2000 mL distillation flask (water was refilled as needed) and the distillation was started. The EO and hydrolate were collected in a separator with an outlet for the hydrolate (the hydrolate was collected in a dark flask during the distillation). The distillation was finished when the amount of obtained essential oil remained constant. After distillation, the rest of the hydrolate was separated from the essential oil, put into the dark flask and stored at 4 Â°C. The final sample of hydrolate was obtained by mixing the hydrolates from three distillation runs.</p>
