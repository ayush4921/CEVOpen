0: Steam distillation was performed in a steam distillation system.
1: The distillation flask was connected to a cylindrical body containing the plant material.
2: The hydrolate was prepared as follows: the appropriate amount of plant material was weighed into the cylindrical body.
3: Then, 1500 mL of deionized water was placed into the 2000 mL distillation flask (water was refilled as needed) and the distillation was started.
4: The EO and hydrolate were collected in a separator with an outlet for the hydrolate (the hydrolate was collected in a dark flask during the distillation).
5: The distillation was finished when the amount of obtained essential oil remained constant.
6: After distillation, the rest of the hydrolate was separated from the essential oil, put into the dark flask and stored at 4 C. The final sample of hydrolate was obtained by mixing the hydrolates from three distillation runs.
