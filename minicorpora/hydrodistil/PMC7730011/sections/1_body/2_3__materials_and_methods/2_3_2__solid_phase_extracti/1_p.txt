0: After obtaining the hydrolates (H SD or H HD), they were 50 concentrated using Separon SGX C18 (modified octadecylsilicagel, 60 m, 0.5 g) into a 96% ethanol.
1: The sorbent in the column was activated with 5 mL of methanol, and finally rinsed with 10 mL of sterile distilled water.
2: Then 100 mL of hydrolate was passed through the column using a syringe, after which the compounds were eluted from the sorbent using 2 mL of ethanol solvent.
3: The extract obtained by SPE from hydrolates is called an H SD_SPE or H HD_SPE extract within the text.
