<p>After obtaining the hydrolates (H
 <sub>SD</sub> or H
 <sub>HD</sub>), they were 50× concentrated using Separon SGX C18 (modified octadecylsilicagel, 60 µm, 0.5 g) into a 96% ethanol. The sorbent in the column was activated with 5 mL of methanol, and finally rinsed with 10 mL of sterile distilled water. Then 100 mL of hydrolate was passed through the column using a syringe, after which the compounds were eluted from the sorbent using 2 mL of ethanol solvent. The extract obtained by SPE from hydrolates is called an H
 <sub>SD_SPE</sub> or H
 <sub>HD_SPE</sub> extract within the text.
