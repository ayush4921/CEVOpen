0: GC-FID analyses of the obtained hydrolates were carried out using a GC 2010 Gas Chromatograph with flame ionization detector (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) and Autosampler Combi Pal (CTC Analytics, AG, Zwingen, Swizerland).
1: The GC-FID conditions were the same as for the GC-MS analysis.
2: The injector temperature was set to 200 C and the detector temperature was set to 270 C. Then, 1 L of extract was injected with a split ratio of 1:50.
3: Chemical compounds were identified using the experimental results of retention indices, which were calculated according to the van den Dool and Kratz method, using  n-alkanes as external references.
4: The calculated retention indices were additionally compared with the retention indices of identified compounds from mass spectra analysis.
