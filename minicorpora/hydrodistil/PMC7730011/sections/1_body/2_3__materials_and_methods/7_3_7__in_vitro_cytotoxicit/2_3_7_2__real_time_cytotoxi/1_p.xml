<p>The cytotoxicity of the concentrated hydrolates (H
 <sub>HD_SPE</sub> and H
 <sub>SD_SPE</sub>) was assessed against A549 cells using the xCELLigence RTCA (real-time cell analysis) SP (single-plate) system (Roche Diagnostic, Germany), allowing the label-free dynamic monitoring of cell events in real-time. The principle of the system is to monitor the changes in electrode impedance induced by the interaction between testing cells and electrodes [

 <xref rid="B77-molecules-25-05654" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. The xCELLigence system was connected and tested by Resistor Plate Verification before the RTCA SP station was placed inside the incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Background measurements were taken by adding 100 μL of appropriate medium to the wells of the E-Plate 96. A cell suspension (90 μL) at cell density of 4000 cells per well was added to each well of the E-plate 96. The A549 cell proliferation was dynamically monitored at the 30 min interval. When the cells entered the logarithmic growth phase, they were treated with 10 μL of concentrated hydrolates (H
 <sub>HD_SPE</sub> and H
 <sub>SD_SPE</sub>) dissolved in ethanol at concentrations of 0.4% for both lavender H
 <sub>HD_SPE</sub> and lavender H
 <sub>SD_SPE</sub> hydrolates, 0.8% for fennel H
 <sub>HD_SPE</sub>, 0.4% for fennel H
 <sub>SD_SPE</sub>, 0.8% for bay leaves H
 <sub>HD_SPE</sub>, 0.4% bay leaves H
 <sub>SD_SPE</sub>, and 0.1% for both clove H
 <sub>HD_SPE</sub> and clove H
 <sub>SD_SPE</sub> in triplicates. Cells treated with 0.1%, 0.4% and 0.8% ethanol were used as the vehicle control while cells treated with 5% DMSO were used as the positive control. After 72 h of incubation with tested compounds, the cell status and the cytotoxic effect were plotted using the characteristic cell index-time profile. Growth curves were normalized to the time point of treatment. Evaluations were performed using the RTCA 1.2.1 software.
