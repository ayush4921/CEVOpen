0: The cytotoxicity of the concentrated hydrolates (H HD_SPE and H SD_SPE) was assessed against A549 cells using the xCELLigence RTCA (real-time cell analysis) SP (single-plate) system (Roche Diagnostic, Germany), allowing the label-free dynamic monitoring of cell events in real-time.
1: The principle of the system is to monitor the changes in electrode impedance induced by the interaction between testing cells and electrodes [ 76, 77].
2: The xCELLigence system was connected and tested by Resistor Plate Verification before the RTCA SP station was placed inside the incubator at 37 C and 5% CO 2.
3: Background measurements were taken by adding 100 L of appropriate medium to the wells of the E-Plate 96.
4: A cell suspension (90 L) at cell density of 4000 cells per well was added to each well of the E-plate 96.
5: The A549 cell proliferation was dynamically monitored at the 30 min interval.
6: When the cells entered the logarithmic growth phase, they were treated with 10 L of concentrated hydrolates (H HD_SPE and H SD_SPE) dissolved in ethanol at concentrations of 0.4% for both lavender H HD_SPE and lavender H SD_SPE hydrolates, 0.8% for fennel H HD_SPE, 0.4% for fennel H SD_SPE, 0.8% for bay leaves H HD_SPE, 0.4% bay leaves H SD_SPE, and 0.1% for both clove H HD_SPE and clove H SD_SPE in triplicates.
7: Cells treated with 0.1%, 0.4% and 0.8% ethanol were used as the vehicle control while cells treated with 5% DMSO were used as the positive control.
8: After 72 h of incubation with tested compounds, the cell status and the cytotoxic effect were plotted using the characteristic cell index-time profile.
9: Growth curves were normalized to the time point of treatment.
10: Evaluations were performed using the RTCA 1.2.1 software.
