<p>Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by a microdilution method in 96-well microtiter plates (SPL Life Sciences, Pocheon-si, South Korea). Hydrolates in Mueller-Hinton broth (MHB; Himedia, India) at concentrations of 0.02–50% were evaluated in a final volume of 100 µL in each well. The wells were inoculated with a microorganism suspension at a density of 1.5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>. After cultivation, MIC was detected by lack of visual turbidity. For the evaluation of minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC), the content of each well was sub-cultured on Mueller-Hinton agar or Sabouraud dextrose agar. MBC was stated as the lowest concentration of the hydrolate that completely inhibited the growth of microorganisms (99.9%) in CFU·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>. Each experiment was performed at least in triplicate, and the displayed concentrations are expressed as a mean.
