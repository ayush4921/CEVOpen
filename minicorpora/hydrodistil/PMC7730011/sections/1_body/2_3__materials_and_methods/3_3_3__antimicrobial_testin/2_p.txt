0: The antimicrobial activity of hydrolates (from steam distillation and hydrodistillation) obtained from lavender, bay leaves, clove, and fennel was tested.
1: The disc diffusion method was used to determine the susceptibility of the strain to the hydrolates.
2: A cell suspension with turbidity according to the McFarland scale were freshly prepared corresponding to the grade 0.5 (~1.5  10 8 CFUmL 1).
3: The microbial cell suspension was spread onto Mueller-Hinton agar (MHA; Himedia, India) or Sabouraud dextrose agar (Himedia, India) plates using a sterile cotton swab.
4: Sterile discs of 6 mm in diameter (Oxoid Ltd., UK) were impregnated with 8 L of the tested sample (or ethanol as a control).
5: After cultivation at 30 C ( Arcobacter-like bacteria) or 37 C (other microbes), the diameter of the inhibition zone was evaluated using a BACMED 6iG2 automated reader and analyzer (Aspiag, Litomysl, Czech Republic).
6: Commercial antimicrobial discs (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) were used as a reference standard of antimicrobial activityampicillin (10 g), ciprofloxacin (5 g), clindamycin (2 g), erythromycin (15 g), fluconazole (25 g), and tetracycline (30 g).
7: Each experiment was performed at least in triplicate, and the displayed inhibition zones are expressed as a mean of inhibition zones with standard deviation.
