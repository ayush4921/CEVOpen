0: Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by a microdilution method in 96-well microtiter plates (SPL Life Sciences, Pocheon-si, South Korea).
1: Hydrolates in Mueller-Hinton broth (MHB; Himedia, India) at concentrations of 0.0250% were evaluated in a final volume of 100 L in each well.
2: The wells were inoculated with a microorganism suspension at a density of 1.5  10 6 CFUmL 1.
3: After cultivation, MIC was detected by lack of visual turbidity.
4: For the evaluation of minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC), the content of each well was sub-cultured on Mueller-Hinton agar or Sabouraud dextrose agar.
5: MBC was stated as the lowest concentration of the hydrolate that completely inhibited the growth of microorganisms (99.9%) in CFUmL 1.
6: Each experiment was performed at least in triplicate, and the displayed concentrations are expressed as a mean.
