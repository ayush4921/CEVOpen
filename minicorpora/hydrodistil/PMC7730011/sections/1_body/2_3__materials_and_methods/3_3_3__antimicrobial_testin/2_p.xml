<p>The antimicrobial activity of hydrolates (from steam distillation and hydrodistillation) obtained from lavender, bay leaves, clove, and fennel was tested. The disc diffusion method was used to determine the susceptibility of the strain to the hydrolates. A cell suspension with turbidity according to the McFarland scale were freshly prepared corresponding to the grade 0.5 (~1.5 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>). The microbial cell suspension was spread onto Mueller-Hinton agar (MHA; Himedia, India) or Sabouraud dextrose agar (Himedia, India) plates using a sterile cotton swab. Sterile discs of 6 mm in diameter (Oxoid Ltd., UK) were impregnated with 8 μL of the tested sample (or ethanol as a control). After cultivation at 30 °C (
 <italic>Arcobacter</italic>-like bacteria) or 37 °C (other microbes), the diameter of the inhibition zone was evaluated using a BACMED 6iG2 automated reader and analyzer (Aspiag, Litomyšl, Czech Republic). Commercial antimicrobial discs (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) were used as a reference standard of antimicrobial activity—ampicillin (10 μg), ciprofloxacin (5 μg), clindamycin (2 μg), erythromycin (15 μg), fluconazole (25 μg), and tetracycline (30 μg). Each experiment was performed at least in triplicate, and the displayed inhibition zones are expressed as a mean of inhibition zones with standard deviation.
