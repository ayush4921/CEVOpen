0: Essential oils (EOs) are an example of highly volatile and water-insoluble plant substances.
1: The chemical composition of EOs is highly complex.
2: The main components include monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes [ 1, 2, 3], and they may also contain aldehydes, alcohols, ketones, acids, esters, or phenylpropanoids [ 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].
3: EOs can be extracted from plants by several methods.
4: One of the oldest and most used methods is distillation [ 2].
5: Aqueous solutions obtained as by-products of the distillation of EOs are known as hydrolates or hydrosols [ 9, 10].
6: Hydrolates have an intense herbal aroma and consist mainly of water and plant material components.
7: Overall, they contain many bioactive hydrophilic substances [ 11].
8: Hydrolates are less described in the literature than EOs.
9: However, it is known that the difference in the composition of a hydrolate from that of an EO is mainly quantitative [ 6].
