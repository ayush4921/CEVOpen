0: Hydrolates also generally contain fewer components, or components at lower concentrations than essential oils, but they still exhibit interesting antimicrobial effects against the microorganisms of interest.
1: Thus, they can be used in medicine or also as a potential preservative in the food industry [ 11, 12, 13, 14, 15].
2: The antimicrobial properties of substances are often influenced by the agronomic area of cultivation and processing of the plant, which affect the proportion of active ingredients [ 16, 17].
3: Given the increasing resistance of microorganisms, it is appropriate to pay attention to the antimicrobial effects of natural substances, even in synergistic combination with certain antibiotics [ 11, 18, 19].
4: The main problem is the resistance of a microorganism with pathogenic potential.
5: Such microorganisms include, but are not limited to, the  Arcobacter-like bacteria.
6: Arcobacters are Gram-negative, slender, spiral-shaped rods, and belong to the family  Arcobacteraceae [ 20].
7: The association of arcobacters with human disease has been demonstrated for  A.  butzleri,  A.  cryaerophilus,  A.  skirrowii and  A.  thereius species [ 21, 22].
8: For these bacteria, survival in the form of planktonic cells or in a biofilm is essential, as they can thus better colonize hosts or contaminate food factory environments [ 23, 24].
9: The major routes of arcobacters transmission to humans include consumption of contaminated foods of animal origin and drinking non-treated water [ 25, 26].
