<p>Essential oils (EOs) are an example of highly volatile and water-insoluble plant substances. The chemical composition of EOs is highly complex. The main components include monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes [

 <xref rid="B10-molecules-25-05654" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Hydrolates have an intense herbal aroma and consist mainly of water and plant material components. Overall, they contain many bioactive hydrophilic substances [
