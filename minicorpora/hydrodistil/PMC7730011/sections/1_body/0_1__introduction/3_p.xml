<p>The aim of this study was to broaden the current knowledge of the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of hydrolates obtained from lavender (
 <italic>Lavandula angustifolia</italic> Mill.), clove (
 <italic>Syzygium aromaticum</italic> L.), fennel (
 <italic>Foeniculum vulgare</italic> Mill.), and bay leaves (
 <italic>Laurus nobilis</italic> L.). All of these natural matrices are widely available, but to date studies have not looked at testing hydrolates obtained from these matrices. Individual hydrolates obtained by distillation were subjected to chemical analysis by gas chromatography with flame ionization detector (GC-FID) and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The antimicrobial activity of the obtained hydrolates was determined by the disc diffusion method, and minimal inhibitory/bactericidal concentration (MIC/MBC) was evaluated by microdilution method. The biofilm formation of microorganisms in the presence of the tested hydrolates was followed by a modified Christensen method in microtiter plates. As far as we know, the effect of natural hydrolates on 
 <italic>Arcobacter</italic>-like bacteria and others has not yet been described, although resistance to commonly used antibiotics observed among 
 <italic>Arcobacter</italic>-like cells emphasizes the importance of research in this area of natural compounds [
