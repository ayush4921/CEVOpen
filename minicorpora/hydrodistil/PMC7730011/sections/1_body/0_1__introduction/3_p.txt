0: The aim of this study was to broaden the current knowledge of the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of hydrolates obtained from lavender ( Lavandula angustifolia Mill.
1: ), clove ( Syzygium aromaticum L.), fennel ( Foeniculum vulgare Mill.
2: ), and bay leaves ( Laurus nobilis L.).
3: All of these natural matrices are widely available, but to date studies have not looked at testing hydrolates obtained from these matrices.
4: Individual hydrolates obtained by distillation were subjected to chemical analysis by gas chromatography with flame ionization detector (GC-FID) and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS).
5: The antimicrobial activity of the obtained hydrolates was determined by the disc diffusion method, and minimal inhibitory/bactericidal concentration (MIC/MBC) was evaluated by microdilution method.
6: The biofilm formation of microorganisms in the presence of the tested hydrolates was followed by a modified Christensen method in microtiter plates.
7: As far as we know, the effect of natural hydrolates on  Arcobacter-like bacteria and others has not yet been described, although resistance to commonly used antibiotics observed among  Arcobacter-like cells emphasizes the importance of research in this area of natural compounds [ 27, 28, 29, 30, 31].
