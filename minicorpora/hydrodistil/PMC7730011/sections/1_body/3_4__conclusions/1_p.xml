<p>This study focuses on the chemical analysis of hydrolates prepared by the hydrodistillation and steam distillation of 
 <italic>Lavandula angustifolia</italic> Mill., 
 <italic>Syzygium aromaticum</italic> L., 
 <italic>Foeniculum vulgare</italic> Mill., and 
 <italic>Laurus nobilis</italic> L., as well as on assessing their antimicrobial potential on planktonic and biofilm cells. The MIC and MBC values of the tested hydrolates were recorded in the range of 0.1â€“12.5%. The highest antimicrobial activity was observed especially in the case of clove hydrolates. As far as we know, the antimicrobial activity of these hydrolates against especially 
 <italic>Arcobacter</italic>-like bacteria has not yet been monitored. The significant antimicrobial activity of the above-mentioned hydrolates against the microorganisms tested is also described for the first time, especially after their concentration by SPE. Concentrated hydrolates also had an inhibitory effect on microbial biofilm formation. Nevertheless, an increase in biofilm activity, for example, was recorded for 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>lanthieri</italic> LMG 28517, 
 <italic>A. butzleri</italic> CCUG 30484 in the clove H
 <sub>SD_SPE</sub> hydrolate, and for 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>thereius</italic> LMG 24488 in the clove H
 <sub>HD_SPE</sub> hydrolate. Moreover, concentrated hydrolates did not show any cytotoxic effect against human A549 cells. Thus, it can be concluded that hydrolates could be used as, for example, natural antimicrobial substances or food preservatives, but further testing will be needed.
