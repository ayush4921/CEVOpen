The cytotoxicity of the hydrolates concentrated by SPE was analyzed using the xCELLigence system against the human lung carcinoma (A549) cells. It was observed that A549 cells treated with determined minimal inhibitory concentrations against microorganisms—0.4% of lavender H
 <sub>HD_SPE</sub> and of lavender H
 <sub>SD_SPE</sub>, 0.8% of fennel H
 <sub>HD_SPE</sub>, 0.4% of fennel H
 <sub>SD_SPE</sub>, 0.8% of bay leaves H
 <sub>HD_SPE</sub>, 0.4% of bay leaves H
 <sub>SD_SPE</sub> and 0.1% of clove H
 <sub>HD_SPE</sub> and H
 <sub>SD_SPE</sub>—were proliferating in parallel with cells treated with vehicle control, as indicated by the increase in CI values (

This showed that A549 cell growth was not affected, thus suggesting the negligible cytotoxicity of the concentrated hydrolates tested in this study. Several studies also describing the cytotoxicity of lavender, laurel, fennel and other extracts have been published in the past [
