<p>In total, 9 identified compounds (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05654-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>) amounted to 99.3% in both extracts. The major group of identified compounds were phenolic derivatives, namely eugenol (E, 92.7% in H
 <sub>HD_SPE</sub> extract, 89.1% in H
 <sub>SD_SPE</sub> extract) and eugenyl acetate (EA, 9.4% in H
 <sub>SD_SPE</sub> extract, 5.6% in H
 <sub>HD_SPE</sub> extract). The difference in the E/EA ratio is given by the more unfavorable conditions during HD than during SD. Eugenyl acetate is hydrolyzed to form eugenol. It is similar to linalyl acetate, which is hydrolyzed during the hydrodistillation of lavender oil (see 2.1.1).
