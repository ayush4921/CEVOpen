<p>In total, 13 compounds were identified in both types of hydrolates (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05654-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>), and these compounds amounted to 84.1% in the H
 <sub>SD_SPE</sub> extracts and 85.1% in the H
 <sub>HD_SPE</sub> extracts. The main compounds in hydrolates were estragole and fenchone; both compounds formed almost 50% of the extracts. Estragole and fenchone are the major components of fennel EOs [
