<p>In total, 33 compounds were identified in both types of hydrolates (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05654-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The identified compounds amounted to 78.0% in the H
 <sub>HD_SPE</sub> extracts and 79.4% in the H
 <sub>SD_SPE</sub> extracts. The composition of both hydrolates was similar with respect to the identified compounds. Most of the identified compounds were oxidized monoterpenes (22 compounds accounted for 72.1% in the H
 <sub>SD_SPE</sub> extracts and 73.2% in the H
 <sub>HD_SPE</sub> extracts). The dominant compound in both types of extracts was 1,8-cineol (56.4% in the H
 <sub>SD_SPE</sub> extract, 54.1% in the H
 <sub>HD_SPE</sub> extract). Additionally, the EO of this matrix contains especially high levels of 1,8-cineol, linalool and R-terpinylacetate, as well as benzene compounds (eugenol, methyleugenol and elemicin) [
