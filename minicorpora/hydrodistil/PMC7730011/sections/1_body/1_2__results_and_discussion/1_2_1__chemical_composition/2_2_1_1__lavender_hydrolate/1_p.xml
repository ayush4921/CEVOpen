<p>In total, 48 compounds (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05654-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) were identified by mass spectrometry and by comparing the calculated retention indexes with the literature data. The identified compounds amounted to 93.2% in the H
 <sub>HD_SPE</sub> extracts and 90.0% in the H
 <sub>SD_SPE</sub> extracts. The major group of identified compounds was oxidized monoterpenes (34 identified compounds that accounted for 86.5% in the H
 <sub>HD_SPE</sub> extract and 82.3% in the H
 <sub>SD_SPE</sub> extract). The biggest difference in the chemical compositions of both extracts from lavender hydrolates was in the content of linalool (23.2% in the H
 <sub>HD_SPE</sub>, 7.9% in the H
 <sub>SD_SPE</sub>). Linalool is one of the major compounds of lavender oils. Another major compound in lavender oils is linalyl acetate. The decomposition of linalyl acetate to linalool due to hydrolysis has been reported [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-25-05654" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], and could be the main cause of the higher content of linalool in the hydrolate obtained by hydrodistillation (HD) due to the more unfavorable conditions in HD than in SD. A relatively high difference was observed in the content of coumarins (namely coumarin and 7-methoxycoumarin; H
 <sub>SD_SPE</sub> 3.8% in total, H
 <sub>HD_SPE</sub> 0.9% in total), and also in the proportion of linalool derivatives (mainly furanoxides and pyranoxides; H
 <sub>SD_SPE</sub> 23.5% in total, H
 <sub>HD_SPE</sub> 15.7% in total). The second most abundant compound in the extracts was 1,8-cineol, the content of which was similar (20.6% in the H
 <sub>SD_SPE</sub> extract, 19.5% in the H
 <sub>HD_SPE</sub> extract).
