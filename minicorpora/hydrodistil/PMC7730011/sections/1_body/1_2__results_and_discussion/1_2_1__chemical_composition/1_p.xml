 <xref rid="molecules-25-05654-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> lists some results of the analysis of concentrated hydrolates obtained by steam distillation (H
 <sub>SD_SPE</sub>) and hydrodistillation (H
 <sub>HD_SPE</sub>). The analyzed hydrolates, especially from lavender and laurel, were rich in a number of compounds. When comparing the results with respect to the hydrolate obtained by hydrodistillation (H
 <sub>HD</sub>) and steam distillation (H
 <sub>SD</sub>), more compounds were detected in the extracts from steam distillation (SD) hydrolates. This was probably caused by the more favorable conditions during steam distillation. During hydrodistillation, the plant material is in contact with boiling water throughout the distillation, and some of the volatile compounds may be converted (via oxidative reactions, polymerization and hydrolysis) into different substances [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-25-05654" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The content of individual compounds is expressed as a percentage of the total peak area in the chromatograms obtained by the GC-FID analysis of H
 <sub>SD_SPE</sub> extracts and H
 <sub>HD_SPE</sub> extracts, so these are approximate values.
