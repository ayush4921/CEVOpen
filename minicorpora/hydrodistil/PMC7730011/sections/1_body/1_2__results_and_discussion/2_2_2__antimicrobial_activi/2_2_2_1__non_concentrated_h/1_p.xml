<p>For most of the tested hydrolates H
 <sub>HD</sub> and H
 <sub>SD</sub>, no antimicrobial activity against the observed microorganisms was recorded. For this reason, the data are not presented in the form of a table. Most of the studied arcobacters were not suppressed by non-concentrated hydrolates at all. However, a very weak antimicrobial activity of clove hydrolate was reported just against 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>thereius</italic> LMG 24488 (H
 <sub>HD</sub>, inhibition zone 6.5 ± 0.3 mm; H
 <sub>SD</sub>, inhibition zone 6.8 ± 0.4 mm). None of the tested arcobacters were suppressed by the hydrolates obtained by the distillation of lavender, fennel and laurel.
