<p>The obtained results show that the prepared non-concentrated hydrolates do not have significant antimicrobial potential against the tested microorganisms. The antimicrobial activity of hydrolates is also significantly influenced by the method used to obtain the distilled matrices [

There is limited information in the literature about the antimicrobial effects of hydrolates, but many studies describe the antimicrobial activity of EOs. The greater antimicrobial activity of EOs is mainly due to the higher concentration of the main essential components. Importantly, even the hydrolates obtained by distillation still have antimicrobial activity [
