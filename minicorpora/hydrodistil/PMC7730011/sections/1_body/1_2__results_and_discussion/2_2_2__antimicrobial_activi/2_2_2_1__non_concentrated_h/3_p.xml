<p>Although linalool as a pure chemical has been demonstrated [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-25-05654" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] to be a potent antimicrobial agent against a wide range of microorganisms, except 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, its higher percentage did not give the expected results for HD hydrolate extract in the antimicrobial assay. Coumarin and its derivatives have been evaluated as having potentially broad antimicrobial activity [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-25-05654" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-25-05654" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In combination with the relatively high differences in linalool derivative content, this may be one of the causes of the higher antimicrobial activity of H
 <sub>SD</sub> extracts (see 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05654-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). It was previously reported that the high linalool content or its addition to an EO significantly increases its antimicrobial effects [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-25-05654" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. A greater antimicrobial effect of the laurel-derived hydrolate against Gram-positive bacteria has been reported in the literature [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-25-05654" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. However, this has not been unequivocally confirmed in our study.
