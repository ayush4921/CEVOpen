<p>According to our results, weak antimicrobial activity on other Gram-negative (

 <italic>aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>coli</italic>) bacteria was observed only in the case of clove hydrolate, in the range of inhibition zones 7.0–7.3 mm. In general, Gram-negative bacteria are more resistant to, e.g., EOs than Gram-positive bacteria, mainly due to the composition of the cell wall [
