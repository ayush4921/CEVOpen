<p>In contrast, concentrated hydrolates exhibited significant antimicrobial activity (see

 <xref rid="molecules-25-05654-t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>) with inhibition zones up to 23.5 mm in diameter and minimal inhibitory (bactericidal) concentration up to 0.1%. The inhibitory effect of concentrated hydrolates may be partially due to the presence of extraction reagent (ethanol). The influence of ethanol on the resulting inhibitory activity of the concentrated hydrolates was, of course, also evaluated. The antimicrobial activity of ethanol is presented in

 <xref rid="molecules-25-05654-t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>; however, the inhibition zones of the pure solvent were only recorded in the range of 6.3–9 mm (MIC in the range 1.6–12.5%), depending on the strain tested.
