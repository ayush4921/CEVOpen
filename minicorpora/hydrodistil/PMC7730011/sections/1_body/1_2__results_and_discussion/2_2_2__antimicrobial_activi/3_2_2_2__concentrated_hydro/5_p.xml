 <sub>SD_SPE</sub> (13.3 ± 0.9 mm inhibition zone; MIC 0.4%). It has been previously reported that laurel hydrolates have significant antifungal activity [

 <italic>albicans</italic> CCM 8186 yeast (inhibition zone 23.5 ± 0.7 mm; MIC 1.6%). Antimicrobial and antifungal effects have already been described in eugenol, the main aromatic component of cloves [

 <xref rid="B56-molecules-25-05654" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The antimicrobial effect of clove hydrolate appears to be supported, inter alia, by the eugenyl acetate content, which is higher than in the H
 <sub>SD_SPE</sub>, and in which a higher antimicrobial effect was also observed compared to the H
 <sub>HD_SPE</sub>. It has previously been reported in the literature that the incorporation of acetate into a molecule may increase the antimicrobial effect [
