<p>Significant inhibition was observed in the presence of concentrated hydrolates H
 <sub>HD_SPE</sub> and H
 <sub>SD_SPE</sub>. Overall, the minimum inhibitory concentrations of all monitored samples in the range of 0.1–6.3% were found. In the vast majority of cases, the MIC and MBC values were the same or lower. However, in general, most of the hydrolates obtained by steam distillation showed higher antimicrobial activities compared to hydrolates obtained by hydrodistillation. Both concentrated clove hydrolates exhibited the highest antimicrobial activity of all the matrices tested. Clove is a very rich source of various antimicrobials [

The lowest minimum inhibitory concentrations, in the range of just 0.1–0.8%, were measured for clove hydrolate, and can be considered essentially the most antimicrobially effective.
