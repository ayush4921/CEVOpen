 <xref rid="molecules-25-05654-t008" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref> shows, for comparison, the inhibitory effects of common antimicrobials against the microorganisms involved in this study. Based on the comparison of the inhibition zones of antibiotics/antifungals and the monitored samples (

 <xref rid="molecules-25-05654-t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>), it is evident that the antimicrobial effect of antibiotics is higher. However, it is also necessary to look for suitable alternatives to antimicrobial substances in purely natural materials [
