<p>Both concentrated hydrolates (H

 <italic>aureus</italic> CCM 4223. The lowest inhibitory activities were observed with lavender-derived hydrolates, then laurel and fennel, and the greatest antimicrobial effect was determined with clove hydrolate, with inhibition zones up to 15.8 mm and MIC at 0.4%. In

 <italic>faecalis</italic> CCM 4224, an inhibition zone of 15.0 ± 0.1 mm was observed for fennel H
 <sub>SD_SPE</sub>. This is possibly due to the higher estragole and 
 <italic>p</italic>-methoxy cinnamaldehyde content in H
 <sub>SD_SPE</sub> compared to H
 <sub>HD_SPE</sub> with lower antimicrobial activity. Conversely, however, fennel H
 <sub>HD_SPE</sub> has a higher content of eugenol and eugenyl acetate, which are known to have high antimicrobial potential [
