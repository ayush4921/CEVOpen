<p>Lavender H

 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>butzleri</italic> CCUG 30484 and 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>thereius</italic> LMG 24488 (13.5 ± 0.6 and 13.3 ± 0.9 mm inhibition zones, respectively). On the contrary, the growth of the

 <italic>butzleri</italic> UPa 2012/3 strain was more inhibited by lavender H
 <sub>HD_SPE</sub> (inhibition zone 12.8 ± 0.3 mm). The antimicrobial effects of both lavender EO and hydrolate have also been previously described in the literature [

 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>cryaerophilus</italic> UPa 2013/13, in which an inhibition zone of 16.5 ± 0.3 mm was recorded for clove H

 <sub>SD_SPE</sub> (inhibition zones 14.0 ± 0.8 and 14.5 ± 0.3 mm, respectively). The highest resistance of arcobacters was observed especially in relation to fennel hydrolate.
