<p>Significantly different results were obtained in the presence of concentrated hydrolates. In the case of concentrated hydrolates, increased biofilm formation was found in some tested strains compared to the amount of biofilm formed in the extraction solvent alone (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05654-f001">Figure 1</xref>b, red line). In the 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>thereius</italic> LMG 24488 strain, an increase in biofilm formation was observed even in the environment of the concentrated samples (except for the fennel hydrolates). A rapid increase in biofilm activity was also observed in the clove H
 <sub>SD_SPE</sub> environment for 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>lanthieri</italic> LMG 28517 and H
 <sub>HD_SPE</sub> for 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>thereius</italic> LMG 24488. Clove H
 <sub>SD_SPE</sub> also contains approximately twice the amount of eugenyl acetate (see 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05654-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>), which could affect biofilm formation in these bacteria. However, the increased biofilm formation in the presence of hydrolates obtained from 
 <italic>Syzygium aromaticum</italic> can be explained by the very severe stress effect. The matrix contains a considerable amount of antimicrobial agents, however the natural protective function of some microorganisms is the formation of a biofilm structure [
 <xref rid="B64-molecules-25-05654" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Biofilm structure is largely protected from external influences and microorganisms are more resistant. Clove hydrolate has been shown to be more antimicrobially effective against planktonic cells (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05654-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>), but bacteria often respond to the significant inhibitory effect of bacteria by increasing and rapid biofilm formation. Clove hydrolate contains a high proportion of eugenol (see 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05654-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>), for which an antibiofilm effect has been previously described [
 <xref rid="B65-molecules-25-05654" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. However, it certainly depends on the amount of the substance and also on the specific case of the microbial strain, as also stated in the publication.
