<p>The characterization of new potential antimicrobial agents is important, inter alia, in terms of the increasing resistance of microorganisms. In this respect, the inhibition of not only planktonic cells but also biofilm formation is often important [
 <xref rid="B59-molecules-25-05654" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The bacteria in a biofilm are more resistant and are more difficult to remove from surfaces than planktonic cells [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05654-f001">Figure 1</xref>, which shows the different values of biofilm activity that also depended on the preparation method of the given hydrolate (H
 <sub>HD</sub> vs. H
 <sub>SD</sub>). Most of the natural concentrated hydrolates obtained by hydrodistillation showed a higher antibiofilm effect (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05654-f001">Figure 1</xref>b). However, a higher antimicrobial effect on planktonic cells was observed for hydrolates obtained by steam distillation. This could probably be explained by the fact that the higher antimicrobial efficacy of some substances (under certain circumstances) may induce an increased biofilm formation activity of microorganisms. The effects on biofilm structures may often not be as significant as in the case of planktonic cells. This may depend, for example, on the cellular metabolic activity, and the amount of extracellular polymer matrix in the biofilm structure [
 <xref rid="B62-molecules-25-05654" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], and increased biofilm formation can also be considered when exposed to substances with a higher antimicrobial effect.
