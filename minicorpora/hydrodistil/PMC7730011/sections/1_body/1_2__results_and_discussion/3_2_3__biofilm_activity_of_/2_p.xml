<p>According to our preliminary testing, all microbial strains used can be considered biofilm-positive. The biofilm formation of all tested strains was reduced in the environment of the prepared hydrolates in contrast to the amount of biofilm formed in water without the presence of hydrolates (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05654-f001">Figure 1</xref>a, red line). Some strains exhibited a significant decrease in the amount of biofilm formed in the presence of non-concentrated hydrolates, e.g., 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>thereius</italic> (by up to 35.9%) and 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>lanthieri</italic> (by up to 31.0%) in the case of the H
 <sub>SD_SPE</sub> of bay leaves hydrolate. On the other hand, a slightly reduced biofilm activity was determined in the case of, e.g., 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>butzleri</italic> (by up to 18.7% in the case of the H
 <sub>SD_SPE</sub> of bay leaves). In agreement with this, a significant antibiofilm effect of, e.g., lavender and clove EOs is described in the literature [
 <xref rid="B63-molecules-25-05654" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], which is associated with a significantly higher content of individual active substances. Previously, there has also been a mention in the literature of the antibiofilm activities of, e.g., lavender and oregano with 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>aureus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B63-molecules-25-05654" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>].
