<p>The constituents of the leaf essential oil were analyzed by Thermo Trace GC Ultra gas chromatograph equipped with a Polaris Q MSD mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Austin, TX, USA). Each 1 μL analyte was injected into the DB-5MS capillary column (Crossbond 5% phenyl methyl polysiloxane, 30 m length × 0.25 mm i.d. × 0.25 µm film thickness). The temperature program was: 60 °C initial temperature for 1 min; 4 °C/min up to 220 °C and hold for 2 min; and 20 °C/min up to 250 °C and hold for 3 min. The flow rate of carrier gas helium was 1 mL/min, and the split ratio was 1:10. Constituents were identified by comparing the mass spectra (
