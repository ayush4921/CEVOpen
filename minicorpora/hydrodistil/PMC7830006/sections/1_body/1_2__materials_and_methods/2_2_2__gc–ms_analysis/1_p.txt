0: The constituents of the leaf essential oil were analyzed by Thermo Trace GC Ultra gas chromatograph equipped with a Polaris Q MSD mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Austin, TX, USA).
1: Each 1 L analyte was injected into the DB-5MS capillary column (Crossbond 5% phenyl methyl polysiloxane, 30 m length  0.25 mm i.d.
2: 0.25 m film thickness).
3: The temperature program was: 60 C initial temperature for 1 min; 4 C/min up to 220 C and hold for 2 min; and 20 C/min up to 250 C and hold for 3 min.
4: The flow rate of carrier gas helium was 1 mL/min, and the split ratio was 1:10.
5: Constituents were identified by comparing the mass spectra ( m/ z 50600 amu) with NIST and Wiley library data, Kovats index (KI) [ 34] and authentic standards.
6: Quantification of constituents was analyzed by integrating the peak area of the chromatogram using GC equipped with the flame ionization detector (FID).
