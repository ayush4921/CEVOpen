<p>An accelerated dry-heat aging test (ISO 5630–1; CNS 12,887–1) was used to evaluate the thermostability of leaf oil microcapsules. Microcapsules were heated at 105 °C in a ventilated oven. Weights of leaf oil microcapsules were measured during the accelerated dry-heat aging test (1, 2, 4, and 8 days). After the aging test, weight losses of leaf oil microcapsules were calculated.</p>
