0: An accelerated dry-heat aging test (ISO 56301; CNS 12,8871) was used to evaluate the thermostability of leaf oil microcapsules.
1: Microcapsules were heated at 105 C in a ventilated oven.
2: Weights of leaf oil microcapsules were measured during the accelerated dry-heat aging test (1, 2, 4, and 8 days).
3: After the aging test, weight losses of leaf oil microcapsules were calculated.
