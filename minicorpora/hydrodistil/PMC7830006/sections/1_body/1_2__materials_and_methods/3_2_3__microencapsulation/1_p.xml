Linalool/leaf essential oil (0.88 g) was dissolved in 10 mL ethanol; and then added to the β-cyclodextrin solution, stirred at 600 rpm for 1 h. The solution was kept in the refrigerator at 4 °C overnight; the co-precipitated microcapsules were filtered and then washed with 50 mL distilled water. Microcapsules were dried at 50 °C in the oven for 24 h. The yield of leaf oil microcapsules was calculated by the following Formula (1). 
 <disp-formula>Yield (%) = microcapsules (g)/[β-cyclodextrin (g) + leaf essential oil (g)] × 100
