0: Leaf essential oil microencapsulated with -cyclodextrin was using the co-precipitation method with slight revisions [ 35, 36, 37].
1: -Cyclodextrin (5 g) was first dissolved in 300 mL different ratio of ethanol/water solution at 50 C for 5 min; the solution was cooled down to 25 C. Linalool/leaf essential oil (0.88 g) was dissolved in 10 mL ethanol; and then added to the -cyclodextrin solution, stirred at 600 rpm for 1 h. The solution was kept in the refrigerator at 4 C overnight; the co-precipitated microcapsules were filtered and then washed with 50 mL distilled water.
2: Microcapsules were dried at 50 C in the oven for 24 h. The yield of leaf oil microcapsules was calculated by the following Formula (1).
3: Yield (%) = microcapsules (g)/[-cyclodextrin (g) + leaf essential oil (g)]  100  (1)
