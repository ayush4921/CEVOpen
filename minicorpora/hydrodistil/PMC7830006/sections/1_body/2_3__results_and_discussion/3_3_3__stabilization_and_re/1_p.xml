<p>The constituents of common essential oils from aroma plants are small molecular weight and highly volatile. The encapsulation of limonene would influence its properties, such as evaporation, stabilization and controlled release, by different encapsulation methods and selected materials. The retention of limonene in extruded starch (non-encapsulation) was quite low (8.0%) compared with that of limonene microencapsulated with Î²-cyclodextrin (92.2%) [
