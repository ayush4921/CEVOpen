<p>Using the accelerated dry-heat aging test to evaluate the stability and release of leaf essential oil microcapsules. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00409-f003">Figure 3</xref> shows the weight losses of β-cyclodextrin (β-CD), linalool-chemotype leaf essential oil (LL oil), and leaf oil microcapsules (β-CD/LL oil) at 105 °C during the accelerated aging period. The weight loss of β-CD was very slight (less than 0.5%) after 8 days of the accelerated aging test; it indicated that β-CD was thermostable at 105 °C. Trotta et al. (2000) investigated the thermal behavior of β-CD; the decomposition temperature of β-cyclodextrin was 250 °C by using the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-26-00409" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Weight losses of linalool-chemotype leaf essential oil was 99.1% after 30 min at 105 °C (data not shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00409-f002">Figure 2</xref>); leaf essential oil exhibited highly volatile in the high-temperature environment. Weight losses of leaf essential oil microcapsules were 6.73%, 9.33%, 12.14%, and 13.40% after 1, 2, 4, and 8 days of the aging test, respectively. Results revealed that microencapsulation with β-cyclodextrin slowed down the release/emission of leaf essential oil in the dry-heat aging test and improved the thermal stabilization of linalool-chemotype leaf essential oil.
