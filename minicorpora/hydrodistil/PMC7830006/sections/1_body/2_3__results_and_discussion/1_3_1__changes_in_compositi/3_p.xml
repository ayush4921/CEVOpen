<p>Similar degradation was observed from the gas chromatogram of leaf essential oil after the heat treatment at 150 °C for 30 min (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00409-f001">Figure 1</xref>C). Linalool had a remarkable decrease in content from 93.30% in the original leaf essential oil to 27.54% in the 150 °C-degraded specimens. The peaks of the new compounds generated under more severe heat treatment became more obvious; 
 <italic>trans</italic>-ocimene was present in the degraded leaf essential oil of 20.08%, β-myrcene 17.89%, 
 <italic>cis</italic>-ocimene 11.72%, limonene 11.40%, terpinolene 3.37%, and α-terpinene 1.69%, in comparison with the original leaf essential oil, where these contents were much smaller. The increased amount (65.22%) of these compounds was close to the decrease in linalool (65.76%). 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00409-f002">Figure 2</xref> illustrates the degradation mechanism of linalool and chemical structures of degradation products. After heat treatments at 100 °C and 150 °C, compounds β-myrcene, 
 <italic>cis</italic>-ocimene and 
 <italic>trans</italic>-ocimene were formed through the dehydroxylation of linalool. Moreover, ene cyclization occurred to linalool and its dehydroxylated products, further formed the compounds limonene, terpinolene and α-terpinene.
