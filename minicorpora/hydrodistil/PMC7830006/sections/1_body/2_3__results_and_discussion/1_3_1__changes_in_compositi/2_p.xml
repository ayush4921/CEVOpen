<p>As presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00409-f001">Figure 1</xref>B, several significant peaks occurred in the gas chromatogram of leaf essential oil after the heat treatment at 100 °C for 30 min. The content of the main constitute, linalool, was reduced from 93.30% to 64.01% (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00409-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). New constituents were observed for β-myrcene (5.56%), α-phellandrene (0.91%), α-terpinene (1.49%), 
 <italic>cis</italic>-ocimene (4.70%), γ-terpinene, and terpinolene (2.53%) in the thermally degraded leaf essential oil. Major variations were found for the increasing contents of limonene and 
 <italic>trans</italic>-ocimene, which were 0.61% and 0.32% in the raw leaf essential oil and obviously increased to 7.77% and 7.94% in the thermally degraded specimen.
