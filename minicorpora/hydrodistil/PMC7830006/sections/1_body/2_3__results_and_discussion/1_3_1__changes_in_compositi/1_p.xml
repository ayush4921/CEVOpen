<p>Constituents of 
 <italic>C. osmophloeum</italic> leaf essential oil were analyzed by GC–MS; a gas chromatogram of leaf essential oil is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00409-f001">Figure 1</xref>A. The main constituent of leaf essential oil was linalool (93.30%), the other minor constituents were 2-methyl benzofuran (1.99%), α-pinene (0.66%), cinnamyl acetate (0.63%), limonene (0.61%), β-caryophyllene (0.59%), methyl chavicol (0.57%), and 
 <italic>trans</italic>-cinnamaldehyde (0.52%), as listed in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00409-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Due to the high content of linalool, 
 <italic>C. osmophloeum</italic> leaf essential oil was classified into the linalool-chemotype.
