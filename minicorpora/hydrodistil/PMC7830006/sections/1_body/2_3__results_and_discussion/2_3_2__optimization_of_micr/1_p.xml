<p>The preparation method of microencapsulation can influence the property of β-cyclodextrin microcapsules. Kfoury et al. (2016) studied the aroma release effect from the solid inclusion complexes of β-cyclodextrin with trans-anethole by two preparation methods, freeze-drying (FD) and co-precipitation coupled to FD (Cop-FD). Cop-FD microcapsules retained more efficiently trans-anethole than that of FD microcapsules; it revealed co-precipitation method provide superior inclusion characteristics [
