<p>The thermal degradation of linalool-chemotype 
 <italic>C. osmophloeum</italic> leaf oil is investigated by GC–MS. After the heat treatment, compounds β-myrcene, cis-ocimene and trans-ocimene form through the dehydroxylation of linalool and compounds limonene, terpinolene and α-terpinene by a further ene cyclization. The significantly high microcapsule yield of 96.5% is obtained from the optimal reaction conditions with the leaf essential oil to the β-cyclodextrin ratio of 15:85 and ethanol to water ratio of 1:5. Based on the accelerated dry-heat aging assay, β-cyclodextrin is stable under the environment at 105 °C, and microencapsulation with β-cyclodextrin effectively slows down the release/emission of leaf essential oil.
