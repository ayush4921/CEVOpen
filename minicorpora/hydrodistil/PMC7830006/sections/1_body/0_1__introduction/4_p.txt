0: The aims of this study were to investigate the thermal degradation of linalool-chemotype  C. osmophloeum leaf essential oil, find the optimal reaction conditions of microencapsulation of leaf essential oil with -cyclodextrin, and evaluate the stabilization of leaf essential oil microcapsules.
1: Through our research, it is expected to reveal the changes in the chemical structure of linalool during thermal decomposition and properly preserve the linalool-chemotype  C. osmophloeum leaf essential oil by microencapsulating with -cyclodextrin.
