<p>The aims of this study were to investigate the thermal degradation of linalool-chemotype 
 <italic>C. osmophloeum</italic> leaf essential oil, find the optimal reaction conditions of microencapsulation of leaf essential oil with β-cyclodextrin, and evaluate the stabilization of leaf essential oil microcapsules. Through our research, it is expected to reveal the changes in the chemical structure of linalool during thermal decomposition and properly preserve the linalool-chemotype 
 <italic>C. osmophloeum</italic> leaf essential oil by microencapsulating with β-cyclodextrin.
