0: Parts of natural plant products, especially essential oils, are highly volatile in the ambient environment and, therefore, may result in thermal oxidation/degradation.
1: Microencapsulation or nanoencapsulation of the essential oils and extracts could provide protection and enhance the stabilization [ 10, 11, 12].
2: Encapsulation materials used include gelatin, cyclodextrins, gum arabic, caseinates, alginates, cellulose derivatives, chitosans, etc.
3: [ 13, 14, 15, 16].
4: Properties of natural plant products after microencapsulation would be influenced by the kinds of core-shell structures and coating materials [ 17, 18, 19, 20].
