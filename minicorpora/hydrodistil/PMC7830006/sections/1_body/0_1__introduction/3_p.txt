0: Cyclodextrins are amphiphilic hollow cyclic oligosaccharides and form the inclusion complexes with versatile molecules [ 17, 21, 22].
1: -Cyclodextrin, composed of seven - d-glucopyranose units, is the most common cyclodextrin product and of good durability; it is a multifunctional encapsulation material to keep the bioactive ingredients from volatilization, oxidization, and etc.
2: [ 23, 24, 25].
3: Many researchers have reported the microencapsulation of the bioactive constituents, essentials oil, or supercritical fluid extracts with -cyclodextrin [ 9, 10, 26, 27].
4: Ramos et al.
5: proved that the inclusion of isopulegol, an alcoholic monoterpene, in -cyclodextrin is an effective method to improve its antiedematogenic and anti-inflammatory activities [ 28].
6: Cyclodextrins are appropriate carriers for delivering or releasing natural products in the pharmaceutical, food and cosmetic industries [ 16, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33].
