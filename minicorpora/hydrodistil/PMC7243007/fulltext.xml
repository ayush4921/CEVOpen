Several reports have indicated that the treatment of subnormal sperm samples with certain agents prior to artificial insemination significantly improves the fertilizing potential of sperm. We have among others some stimulants such as pentoxifylline, relaxin, prostaglandin E, and diltiazem. In our precedent work, we had tested the effect of supplementation with three essential oils, namely, sage (<italic>Salvia officinalis</italic>), oregano (<italic>Origanum vulgare</italic>), and eucalyptus (<italic>Eucalyptus globulus</italic>), on sperm cell mobility and vitality. Oregano oil had shown interesting biological properties by giving the best values of progressive mobility and vitality. In this study, we aim to verify the effect of oregano oil supplementation on the advanced parameters of mobility and on the integrity of the sperm DNA of 25 male infertile volunteers. Our results showed that oregano oil over an incubation period of 5 to 10&#x02009;min of exposure significantly improves the advanced parameters of mobility, namely, curvilinear velocity (VCL), linear velocity (VSL), the mean velocity of the path (VAP), and the amplitude of the displacement (ALH). The effect of the increase in the VCL decreased the linearity (LIN), the mean line (STR), and the mean wobble (WOB). Oregano oil at 5&#x02009;min had no significant effect on the DNA fragmentation index (DFI) and sperm decondensation index (SDI). However, at 10&#x02009;min, it had a significant effect on both DFI and SDI. The analysis of our results showed that this plant oil rich in terpenoids and phenolic antioxidants could be a quite good in vitro additive with high potential for the world of medically assisted reproduction.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Asthenozoospermia characterized by a sperm cell mobility deficit is one of the major causes of male infertility [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].

Our results are in good agreement with those of Barlow and Liu groups [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Our ALH values are also in agreement with the work of Liu et al., Aitken and Clarkson, and Bongo et al., by showing that ALH is higher in sperm cells of fertile men than those of infertile men; they show also a positive correlation of the effectiveness of penetration into the cervical mucus of sperm with increased ALH [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Several studies have shown that oregano essential oil contains phenolic compounds and flavonoids, in particular, rosmarinic acid, quercetin, kaempferol, apigenin, rutin, and oregano which can cleanse free radicals such as the superoxide anion and hydroxyl [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Thus, the improvement in mobility, the advanced parameters of mobility, and the vitality of spermatozoa by the essential oil of oregano can be explained by its antioxidant activity against lipid peroxidation [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Moreover, Daghigh Kia et al. have shown that the peroxidation of lipids in sperm damages the structure of the lipid matrix in the membranes of sperm and that it is linked to a rapid loss of intracellular ATP which can lead to axonemal damage and reduced sperm viability [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. It is in this same endeavor that Aitken determined that the peroxide radical (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) could be distributed across the membranes of the spermatozoa and thus inhibit the activity of key enzymes such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (enzyme which plays a major role in ATP production and sperm motility) [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Our ALH values agree well with the work of Liu et al., Aitken and Clarkson, and Bongo et al., by showing that ALH is higher in sperm of fertile men and also show a positive correlation of the effectiveness of penetration into the cervical mucus of sperm with an increase in ALH [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>The evaluation of the effect of oregano oil supplementation on DNA integrity at 5&#x02009;min incubation at 37&#x000b0;C under 5% CO<sub>2</sub> did not yield a significant difference for both DFI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>) and SDI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>) values. However, after 10&#x02009;min of incubation, a significant difference was noted for both DFI (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) and SDI (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) with respect to the controls (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">11</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">12</xref>). The absence of a convention on the threshold values of the DFI and the SDI makes it difficult to interpret them. We can say that oregano essential oil does not impact the index of DNA fragmentation and sperm decondensation index because we have recorded lower values than the positive threshold value for DFI (4%) and for SDI (15%) [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Sperm abnormalities can cause not only embryonic development problems [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] but also spontaneous miscarriages [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The low DFI and SDI values can result from various factors in addition to the supplementation of oregano oil because even in the control, we noted low DFI and SDI values. Moreover, numerous studies have shown that alteration of sperm DNA can result from various phenomena such as apoptosis, oxidative stress, production of endogenous Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), and spontaneous and/or exogenous alterations (ionizing radiation, toxic components of the environment), which act on DNA elements by producing a very wide range of damage such as deletions or breaks in free nitrogenous bases [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>The results of oregano oil supplementation on the advanced parameters of mobility and DNA quality of the sperm show that <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> essential oil could be a promising alternative for better male infertility management especially in patients with Asthenozoospermia.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5.
