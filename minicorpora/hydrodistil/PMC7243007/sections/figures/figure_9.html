 <caption> In vitro effect of oregano oil on the mean line (STR). The dilution of EO was done in a 0.2% ( w/ v) sterile agar solution. The percentage of STR of each aliquot was measured after the addition of the EO and 5 min and 10 min treatment. The effect of such an increase in VCL has resulted in a substantial reduction in STR, LIN, and WOB. </caption>
