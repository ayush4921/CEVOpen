 <caption> In vitro effect of oregano oil on DNA fragmentation index. DFI was measured after the addition of the EO and 5 min and 10 min treatment. The dilution of EO was done in a 0.2% ( w/ v) sterile agar solution. The percentage of DFI of each aliquot was measured immediately after the addition of the EO ( t = 5 min) ( P = 0.53; n = 25) and 10 minutes later ( t = 10 min) ( ∗ P &lt; 0.05; n = 25). </caption>
