  <p>In vitro effect of oregano oil on DNA fragmentation index. DFI was measured after the addition of the EO and 5 min and 10 min treatment. The dilution of EO was done in a 0.2% (
   <italic>w</italic>/
   <italic>v</italic>) sterile agar solution. The percentage of DFI of each aliquot was measured immediately after the addition of the EO (
   <italic>t</italic> = 5 min) (
   <italic>P</italic> = 0.53; 
   <italic>n</italic> = 25) and 10 minutes later (
   <italic>t</italic> = 10 min) (
   <sup>∗</sup>
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05; 
   <italic>n</italic> = 25).
