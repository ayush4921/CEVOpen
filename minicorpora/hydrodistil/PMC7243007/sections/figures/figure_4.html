 <caption> In vitro effects of oregano oil on the curvilinear velocity (VCL). The dilution of the EO was performed in 0.2% ( w/ v) sterile agar solution. The percentage of VCL of each aliquot was measured after the addition of the EO and 5 min and 10 min treatment. Oregano oil significantly improves the VCL over a period of 5 to 10 min ( ∗∗ P &lt; 0.01; n = 25). </caption>
