  <p>In vitro effect of oregano oil on the mean line (STR). The dilution of EO was done in a 0.2% (
   <italic>w</italic>/
   <italic>v</italic>) sterile agar solution. The percentage of STR of each aliquot was measured after the addition of the EO and 5 min and 10 min treatment. The effect of such an increase in VCL has resulted in a substantial reduction in STR, LIN, and WOB.
