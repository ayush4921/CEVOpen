 <caption> In vitro effect of oregano oil on the mean velocity of the path (VAP). The dilution of EO was done in a 0.2% ( w/ v) sterile agar solution. The percentage of VAP of each aliquot was measured after the addition of the EO and 5 min and 10 min treatment. Oregano oil could significantly improve the VAP over a period of 5 to 10 min ( ∗∗ P &lt; 0.01; n = 25). </caption>
