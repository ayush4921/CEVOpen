<p>The evaluation of the effect of oregano oil supplementation on DNA integrity at 5 min incubation at 37°C under 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> did not yield a significant difference for both DFI (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>) and SDI (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>) values. However, after 10 min of incubation, a significant difference was noted for both DFI (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) and SDI (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) with respect to the controls (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">11</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">12</xref>). The absence of a convention on the threshold values of the DFI and the SDI makes it difficult to interpret them. We can say that oregano essential oil does not impact the index of DNA fragmentation and sperm decondensation index because we have recorded lower values than the positive threshold value for DFI (4%) and for SDI (15%) [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Sperm abnormalities can cause not only embryonic development problems [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] but also spontaneous miscarriages [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The low DFI and SDI values can result from various factors in addition to the supplementation of oregano oil because even in the control, we noted low DFI and SDI values. Moreover, numerous studies have shown that alteration of sperm DNA can result from various phenomena such as apoptosis, oxidative stress, production of endogenous Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), and spontaneous and/or exogenous alterations (ionizing radiation, toxic components of the environment), which act on DNA elements by producing a very wide range of damage such as deletions or breaks in free nitrogenous bases [
