<p>Several studies have shown that oregano essential oil contains phenolic compounds and flavonoids, in particular, rosmarinic acid, quercetin, kaempferol, apigenin, rutin, and oregano which can cleanse free radicals such as the superoxide anion and hydroxyl [

Moreover, Daghigh Kia et al. have shown that the peroxidation of lipids in sperm damages the structure of the lipid matrix in the membranes of sperm and that it is linked to a rapid loss of intracellular ATP which can lead to axonemal damage and reduced sperm viability [

 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>) could be distributed across the membranes of the spermatozoa and thus inhibit the activity of key enzymes such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (enzyme which plays a major role in ATP production and sperm motility) [
