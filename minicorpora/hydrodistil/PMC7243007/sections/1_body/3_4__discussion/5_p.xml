<p>On the other hand, sperm cell linearity (LIN) (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) and the average wobble (WOB) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>) decreased substantially due to the increase in the VCL and VAP. Our results are in good agreement with those of Barlow and Liu groups [

 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Our ALH values are also in agreement with the work of Liu et al., Aitken and Clarkson, and Bongo et al., by showing that ALH is higher in sperm cells of fertile men than those of infertile men; they show also a positive correlation of the effectiveness of penetration into the cervical mucus of sperm with increased ALH [
