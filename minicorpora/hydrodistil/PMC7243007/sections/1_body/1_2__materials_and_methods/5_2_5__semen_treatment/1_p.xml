<p>After one hour of sperm production, a routine sperm analysis was performed to determine sperm count, motility, and vitality. To make it, a sample of 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of sperm was deposited in a Makler room. The sperm pretreatment was performed using the density gradient optimization technique. Thus, 1 ml of PureSperm® 70%, 1 ml of PureSperm® 45%, and 1 ml of semen sample were added, respectively, in a 10 ml Falcon tube and centrifuged at 500 rpm for 20 min. The pellet (approx. 0.5 ml) was fortified with 10 to 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of BM1, then divided into 2 equal aliquots in 10 ml Falcon tubes; the first tube containing the pellet and BM1 was incubated as a control; the second was also incubated with 1.5 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of oregano oil at a final concentration of [10
 <sup>−3</sup>]. Incubations were performed at 37°C under 5% CO
