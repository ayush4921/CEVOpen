0: After one hour of sperm production, a routine sperm analysis was performed to determine sperm count, motility, and vitality.
1: To make it, a sample of 20  l of sperm was deposited in a Makler room.
2: The sperm pretreatment was performed using the density gradient optimization technique.
3: Thus, 1 ml of PureSperm 70%, 1 ml of PureSperm 45%, and 1 ml of semen sample were added, respectively, in a 10 ml Falcon tube and centrifuged at 500 rpm for 20 min.
4: The pellet (approx.
5: 0.5 ml) was fortified with 10 to 20  l of BM1, then divided into 2 equal aliquots in 10 ml Falcon tubes; the first tube containing the pellet and BM1 was incubated as a control; the second was also incubated with 1.5  l of oregano oil at a final concentration of [10 3].
6: Incubations were performed at 37C under 5% CO 2 ( Figure 1) [ 3].
