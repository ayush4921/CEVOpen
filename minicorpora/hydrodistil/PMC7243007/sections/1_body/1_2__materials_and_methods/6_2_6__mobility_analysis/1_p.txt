0: The effect of oregano oil on advanced parameters of human sperm cell mobility has been evaluated at different incubation periods: 0, 5, and 10 min at 37C under 5% CO 2.
1: The protocol consists of depositing an aliquot of 20  l of the mixture (sperm/oil, control) in a preheated Makler chamber and analyzing by CASA (Hamilton-Thorne Semen Computer-Assisted Analysis version 10 HTM IVOS Analyzer (Hamilton-Thorne Biosciences, Beverly, MA, USA)).
2: The parameters used for the analysis are as follows: number of images, 8; frame rate, 20 Hz; layer thickness 10  l; temperature, 37C; minimum contrast, 6; minimum size, 6; small size grid, 0.4; large size grid, 2.0; low intensity grid, 2.5; and high intensity grid, 4.3 [ 1].
3: Eight representative fields containing at least 100 mobile sperm cells were examined.
4: Throughout the analysis, an integrated heated stage maintained the sample temperature at 37C [ 1].
5: The parameters recorded for each sample were percentage viability, percentage progressive motility, and movement characteristics such as curvilinear velocity (VCL), linear velocity (VSL), mean path velocity (VAP), lateral displacement amplitude (ALH), mean linearity (LIN: VSL/VCL), mean straight line (STR: VSL/VAP), and mean wobble (WOB: VAP/VCL) [ 1].
