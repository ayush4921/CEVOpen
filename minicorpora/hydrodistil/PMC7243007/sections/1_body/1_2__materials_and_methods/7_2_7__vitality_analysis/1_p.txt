0: The assessment of sperm viability was performed with 2% eosin staining [ 3].
1: To do this, semen samples were mixed with an equal volume of eosin solution.
2: A smear on a glass slide was made from the mixture and was allowed to air dry.
3: Immediately after drying, each slide was examined under an optical microscope.
4: The test is performed immediately after contact between the sperm cells and different concentrations of EO ( t = 0 min), at exposure times ranging from 5 to 10 min, and the preparation was incubated at 37C under 5% CO 2 [ 3].
