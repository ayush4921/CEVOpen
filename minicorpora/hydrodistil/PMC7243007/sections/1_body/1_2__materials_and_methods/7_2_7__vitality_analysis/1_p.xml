<p>The assessment of sperm viability was performed with 2% eosin staining [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. To do this, semen samples were mixed with an equal volume of eosin solution. A smear on a glass slide was made from the mixture and was allowed to air dry. Immediately after drying, each slide was examined under an optical microscope. The test is performed immediately after contact between the sperm cells and different concentrations of EO (
 <italic>t</italic> = 0 min), at exposure times ranging from 5 to 10 min, and the preparation was incubated at 37°C under 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> [
