<p>Supplementation of oregano in Asthenozoospermic sperm after 5 and 10 min of incubation at 37°C under 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> does not alter the level of sperm with DNA fragmentation. Because the rate of sperm with DNA fragmentation is as high in the fortified sample as in the control, difference is not significant (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.53) at 5 min. However, on the other hand, we noted a significant difference at 10 min (
