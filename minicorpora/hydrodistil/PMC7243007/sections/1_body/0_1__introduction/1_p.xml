<p>Asthenozoospermia characterized by a sperm cell mobility deficit is one of the major causes of male infertility [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This is due to a decrease in energy levels that can be caused by a failure of the main pathway of ATP hydrolysis, damage to sperm cell structures (flagella), or infections [
