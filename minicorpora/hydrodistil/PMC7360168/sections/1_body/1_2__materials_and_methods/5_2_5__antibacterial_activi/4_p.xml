<p>Essential oil has been diluted by Tween 80 to 1% to have a concentration of 500 mg/mL, and then the first 10 columns of the microplate are filled by the different concentrations of essential oil; from this solution, a series of ½ fold dilutions were prepared to obtain a concentration range between 500 and 1 mg/mL. On microplates, the negative control (column N°11) was chosen to fill the wells with 100
