0: Three chromatographic analyses were performed, and the essential oil was analyzed on a Hewlett-Packard Gas Chromatograph Model 5890 coupled to a Hewlett-Packard Model 5971, equipped with a DB5 MS column (30 m  0.25 mm; 0.25  m), programming from 50C (5 min) to 300C at 5C/min, with a 5-min hold.
1: The helium was used as the carrier gas (1.0 mL/min); injection was in split mode (1:30); injector and detector temperatures were 250C and 280C, respectively.
2: The mass spectrometer worked in EI mode at 70 eV, electron multiplier at 2500 V, and ion source temperature at 180C; MS data were acquired in the scan mode in the m/ z range 33450.
