<p>In addition, the antimicrobial activity of bornyl acetate and camphor has been demonstrated by several works. Indeed, Bougatsos et al. [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], Vagionas et al. [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], and Runyoro et al. [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] report MICs ranging from 1.75 to 4.88 mg/mL for bornyl acetate against several microbial strains. On the other hand, esters and especially bornyl acetate (30.74%) also contribute to the antibacterial effect. Based on the work of Tzakou et al. [
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], the essential oils of two chemotypes of 
 <italic>Thymus longicaulis</italic> rich in geranyl acetate for the first and in acetate 
 <italic>α</italic>-terpenyl for the second possess a high antimicrobial activity.
