  <italic>Ferulago nodosa</italic> (L.) Boiss. (Apiaceae) is a species occurring in the Balkan-Tyrrhenian area. The object of the present study is Sicilian 
  <italic>F. nodosa</italic> subsp. 
  <italic>geniculata</italic> (Guss.) Troia &amp; Raimondo, classified as an endemic 
  <italic>F. nodosa</italic> subspecies. Aerial parts of this plant species were subjected to hydrodistillation to obtain an essential oil. A total of 93 compounds were identified with 2,3,6-trimethyl benzaldehyde (19.0%), spathulenol (9.0%), (
  <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene (5.4%), and caryophyllene oxide (5.4%) as the main components. The biological activities of 
  <italic>F. nodosa</italic> essential oil were also investigated. This oil showed an interesting antioxidant potential in a 2,2′-Azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) test (IC
  <sub>50</sub> of 14.05 μg/mL). Additionally, hypoglycemic and antilipidemic effects were evaluated. Lipase enzyme was inhibited with an IC
  <sub>50</sub> value of 41.99 μg/mL. Obtained data demonstrated that 
  <italic>F. nodosa</italic> could be considered a promising source of bioactive compounds useful for the treatment and management of obesity.
