 <italic>F. nodosa</italic> essential oil α-amylase, α-glucosidase, and lipase inhibitory activities were concentration-dependent, and results are summarized in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-03249-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The essential oil exhibited promising lipase enzyme inhibitory activity, with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 42.0 μg/mL. This value was 0.8 times higher than that found for the positive control, orlistat. A lower enzyme inhibitory activity was found against α-amylase and α-glucosidase, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 196.4 and 365.9 μg/mL, respectively.
