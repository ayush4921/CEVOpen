<p>The α-glucosidase and α-amylase inhibitory activities of 
 <italic>F. bracteata</italic> root extracts were investigated by Karakaya et al. [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-25-03249" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Dichloromethane and ethyl acetate extracts exhibited the lowest IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.95 μg/mL, followed by methanol extract (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 4.19 μg/mL), whereas the aqueous extract was inactive. The effects of 
 <italic>F. angulata</italic> hydroalcoholic extract were evaluated by Musavi-Ezmareh et al. [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-25-03249" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] in diabetic male rats. After supplementation of 200 mg/kg body weight of extract for four weeks, a reduction of blood sugar and an improvement of blood lipid profiles were observed. A similar situation was observed with supplementation of 
 <italic>Ferulago angulata</italic> hydroalcoholic extract in Wistar rats, where a reduction of total cholesterol, low-density lipoproteins, and triglycerides, and an inhibition of lipid peroxidation were observed [

 <xref rid="B40-molecules-25-03249" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. More recently, Parsamehr et al. [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-25-03249" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] confirmed that intraperitoneal injection of 
 <italic>F. angulata</italic> hydroalcoholic extract for three weeks in diabetic rats could be effective in the treatment of diabetes and at the same time alleviate liver damage.
