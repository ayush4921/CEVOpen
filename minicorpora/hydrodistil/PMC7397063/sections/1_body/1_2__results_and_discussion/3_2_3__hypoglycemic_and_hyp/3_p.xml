<p>Several terpenes identified in 
 <italic>F. nodosa</italic> essential oil are able to exert hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic activity. The intraperitoneal administration of α-pinene in diabetic mice at different doses (0.05, 0.10, 0.25 and 0.50 mL/kg) resulted in a reduction of fasting blood glucose levels [

 <xref rid="B43-molecules-25-03249" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] demonstrated that intraperitoneal administration of α-pinene (5, 25, or 50 mg/kg) reduced body weight and the serum levels of α-amylase and lipase. Additionally, the combination of β-caryophyllene (500 μmol) and L-arginine (500 μmol) stabilized glucose tolerance and reduced pancreatic cell damage in diabetic rats [
