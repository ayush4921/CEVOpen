<p>The essential oil obtained from the aerial parts of 
 <italic>F. nodosa</italic> growing in Sicily has previously been studied by Ruberto et al. [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-25-03249" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], who found a different chemical profile, with 2,3,4-trimethylbenzaldehyde (42.2%) and α-pinene (22.4%) as the main constituents. These authors did not detect the 2,3,6-trimethylbenzaldehyde which instead was the major component of our sample. Demetzos et al. [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-25-03249" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] studied the essential oil composition of flowering aerial parts from 
 <italic>F. nodosa</italic> growing in Greece and identified α-pinene (31.1%) as the major component. Notably, they did not detect any aromatic aldehydes. Similar results were published by Evergetis et al. [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-25-03249" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], who studied the essential oil profile of 
 <italic>F. nodosa</italic> growing in Greece, showing α-pinene (30.8%) and β-phellandrene (10.2%) as the main constituents. Thus, the notable chemical polymorphism observed may be the result of significant variability in genetics (e.g., occurrence of different subspecies) together with the influence of geographic factors and the type of processing and extraction of the plant material (e.g., hydrodistillation vs. steam distillation).
