<p>Among the identified compounds, spathulenol, the main abundant volatile component of the 
 <italic>F. nodosa</italic> essential oil, was able to inhibit both DPPH and ABTS radicals, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 85.60 and 639.25 μg/mL, respectively [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-25-03249" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Additionally, this tricyclic sesquiterpenoid exhibited protection against lipoperoxidation in rat brains, with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 26.13 μg/mL and, consequently, decreased the generation of malondialdehyde [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-25-03249" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Coté et al. [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-25-03249" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] demonstrated the DPPH radical scavenging potential of α-pinene and caryophyllene oxide, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 3.4 and 183 μg/mL, respectively, while IC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 200 μg/mL was found for both β-caryophyllene and bornyl acetate.
