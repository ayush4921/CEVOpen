<p>Mileski et al. [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-25-03249" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] reported the antioxidant activity of methanol, ethanol, and aqueous extracts obtained from aerial parts and inflorescences of 
 <italic>F. macedonica</italic>. The DPPH results demonstrated that extract derived from the inflorescences (in the range of 490–1170 μg/mL) were more active than the extract obtained from the aerial parts (630–1810 μg/mL). This evidence was confirmed, also, in an ABTS test. The antioxidant potential of the crude extract and four fractions of 
 <italic>F. carduchorum</italic> aerial parts, at two vegetative stages, were analyzed by Golfakhrabadi et al. [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-25-03249" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The highest DPPH radical scavenging activity was found for flower crude extract, with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.49 mg/mL, followed by fruit crude extract (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.62 mg/mL) and flower methanol fraction (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.68 mg/mL).
