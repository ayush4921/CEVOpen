<p>The antioxidant potential of 
 <italic>F. nodosa</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>geniculata</italic> essential oil was screened using different assays (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-03249-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). ABTS
 <sup>+</sup> radical cation resulted more sensitive to the action of 
 <italic>F. nodosa</italic> essential oil with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 14.0 μg/mL, while an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 26.3 μg/mL was observed in a 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay. The results can be justified because ABTS
 <sup>+</sup> and DPPH
 <sup>.</sup> radicals have different stereochemistry, and after a reaction with essential oil these two radicals give diverse responses. Percentages of 39.4% and 32.7% after 30 and 60 min of incubation, respectively, were recorded in a β-carotene bleaching test when the essential oil was tested at maximum concentration. In a FRAP assay, an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 16.9 μg/mL was observed.
