<p>Several research articles that have 
 <italic>Ferulago</italic> ssp. as the object of investigation confirmed the antioxidant potential of these plants. Previously, Cecchini et al. [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-25-03249" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] compared the DPPH radical scavenging activity of 
 <italic>F. campestris</italic> fruit and root essential oils, and found IC
 <sub>50</sub> mean values of 0.23 and 0.24 μg/mL of oil, respectively. In disagreement with our data, both oils were able to protect lipids from peroxidation in a similar manner to the positive control BHT (IC
 <sub>50</sub> mean values of 0.010 and 0.011 μg/mL for fruit and root essential oils, respectively). A great variability was observed in the DPPH radical scavenging activity of 
 <italic>F. angulate</italic> essential oils derived from different organs. Among them, unripe seed oil showed the highest radical scavenging potential with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 162 μg/mL, followed by leaf (IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 210 μg/mL). These organs are characterized by a higher phenol and flavonoid content, compared with other parts [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-25-03249" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Lower DPPH radical scavenging was found for Iranian 
 <italic>F. angulata</italic> aerial part essential oil (IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 488 μg/mL) [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-25-03249" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. A similar situation was observed for 
 <italic>F. trifida</italic> essential oils with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values in the range 95–120 μg/mL [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-25-03249" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].
