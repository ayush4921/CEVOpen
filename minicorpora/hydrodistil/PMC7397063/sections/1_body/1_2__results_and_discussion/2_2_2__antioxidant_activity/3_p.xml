<p>Our data are in line, also, with those reported by Karakaya et al. [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-25-03249" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], who investigated the antioxidant potential of 
 <italic>F. pauciradiata</italic> extracts and essential oils derived from roots and aerial parts. The highest DPPH activity was observed in root essential oil and ethyl acetate fraction, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 4.59 and 6.56 Î¼g/mL, respectively. Shahbazi and Shavisi [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-25-03249" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] compared the DPPH radical scavenging activity of sub-fractions of methanol extract and the essential oil obtained from 
 <italic>F. bernardii</italic> aerial parts, and found IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 5.66, 6.88 and 14.81 mg/mL, respectively.
