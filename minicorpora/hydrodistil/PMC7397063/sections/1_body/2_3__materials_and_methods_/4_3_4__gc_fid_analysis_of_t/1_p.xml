<p>An Agilent 4890D gas chromatograph (GC) coupled with an ionization flame detector (FID) (Santa Clara, CA, USA) was used to analyze the essential oil. The separation stationary phase was represented by an HP-5 capillary column (5% phenylmethylpolysiloxane, 25 m, 0.32 mm i.d.; 0.17 μm f.t.) (Agilent, Folsom, CA, USA). The mobile phase was helium (99.999%) flowing at 1.0 mL/min. The oven temperature programmer was as follows: 60 °C isothermal for 5 min, then ramp (4 °C/min) to 220 °C, and ramp (11 °C/min) to 280 °C. The essential oil was diluted 1:100 in hexane and the volume injected was 1 μL in split mode (1:34). The injector and detector temperatures were set to 280 °C. A commercial mix of
