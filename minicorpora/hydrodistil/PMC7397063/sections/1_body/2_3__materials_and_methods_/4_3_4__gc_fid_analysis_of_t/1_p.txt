0: An Agilent 4890D gas chromatograph (GC) coupled with an ionization flame detector (FID) (Santa Clara, CA, USA) was used to analyze the essential oil.
1: The separation stationary phase was represented by an HP-5 capillary column (5% phenylmethylpolysiloxane, 25 m, 0.32 mm i.d.
2: ; 0.17 m f.t.)
3: (Agilent, Folsom, CA, USA).
4: The mobile phase was helium (99.999%) flowing at 1.0 mL/min.
5: The oven temperature programmer was as follows: 60 C isothermal for 5 min, then ramp (4 C/min) to 220 C, and ramp (11 C/min) to 280 C. The essential oil was diluted 1:100 in hexane and the volume injected was 1 L in split mode (1:34).
6: The injector and detector temperatures were set to 280 C. A commercial mix of  n-alkanes (C 8C 30) purchased from Supelco (Bellefonte, CA, USA) was used to determine the peak linear retention index (RI).
7: Quantitative values, expressed as percentages, were obtained following the procedure of Cecchini et al.
8: [ 26].
