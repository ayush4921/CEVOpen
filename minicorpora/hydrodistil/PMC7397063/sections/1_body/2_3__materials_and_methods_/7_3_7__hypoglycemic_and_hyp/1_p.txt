1: In the -glucosidase inhibitory test, a mixture of maltose, -glucosidase,  -dianisidine, peroxidase/glucose oxidase, and samples was prepared.
2: In both cases, essential oil was tested at different concentrations, ranging from 25 to 1000 g/mL, and absorbance was measured at 540 and 500 nm, respectively [ 50].
