0: In the -carotene bleaching test a mixture of linoleic acid, -carotene, and Tween 20 was prepared and the resulting emulsion was mixed with the essential oil at different concentrations (2.5100 g/mL) [ 50, 51].
1: The absorbance was read after 30 min of incubation at 470 nm.
2: Propyl gallate was used as a positive control.
3: The essential oil at a concentration of 2.5 mg/mL was tested, also, to evaluate the ability of samples to protect iron from a redox reaction [ 52].
4: BHT was used as a control.
