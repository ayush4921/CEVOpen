<p>An Agilent 6890N GC equipped with a 5973N single quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS) (Santa Clara, CA, USA) was employed. The stationary phase was an HP-5MS capillary column (30 m, 0.25 mm i.d., 0.1 μm f.t.) (Agilent, Folsom, CA, USA). The operative conditions and the mobile phase were the same as those reported above. The injector and transfer line temperatures were 280 and 250 °C, respectively. The same dilution as that reported above was injected into the GC-MS system in split mode (1:50). Mass spectra were acquired in electron impact (EI) mode in the range of 29–400
