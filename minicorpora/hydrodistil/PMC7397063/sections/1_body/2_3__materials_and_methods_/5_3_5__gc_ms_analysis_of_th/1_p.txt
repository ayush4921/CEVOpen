0: An Agilent 6890N GC equipped with a 5973N single quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS) (Santa Clara, CA, USA) was employed.
1: The stationary phase was an HP-5MS capillary column (30 m, 0.25 mm i.d., 0.1 m f.t.)
2: (Agilent, Folsom, CA, USA).
3: The operative conditions and the mobile phase were the same as those reported above.
4: The injector and transfer line temperatures were 280 and 250 C, respectively.
5: The same dilution as that reported above was injected into the GC-MS system in split mode (1:50).
6: Mass spectra were acquired in electron impact (EI) mode in the range of 29400  m/z.
7: The identification was carried out by a combination of MS matching and RI overlapping against the Adams 2007 [ 17], NIST 17 (NIST 17, 2017) [ 48], and FFNSC2 (FFNSC2) [ 49] libraries.
8: The comparison with available authentic standards (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy) was also used.
