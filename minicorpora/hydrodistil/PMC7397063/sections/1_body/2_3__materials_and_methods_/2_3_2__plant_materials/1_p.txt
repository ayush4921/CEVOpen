0: Aerial parts of  F. nodosa subsp.
1: geniculata were harvested in April 2019, immediately before flowering, from different plants growing on a flat-lying litho-soil near Noto Antica, Syracuse, (Sicily, Italy) (365727.37 N; 150218.76 E) of 378 m above sea level.
2: This plant has a distribution limited to the southeastern sector of Sicily, in particular the complex of the Iblei Mountains.
3: It is a circular-limestone plateau of circular shape, dating back to the Miocene, in which the presence of numerous streams dug deep incisions (canyons), locally known as cave iblee.
4: The bioclimate of the area is thermo-Mediterranean dry, which favors both aspects of thermo-xerophilous pine forest ( Pinus halepensis and  Coridothymus capitatus) and all aspects of mesophilic shrub ( Myrtus communis,  Arbutus unedo, and  Pistacia lentiscus).
5: Samples were identified by Prof. Vincenzo Ilardi, University of Palermo, Italy.
6: A voucher specimen (PAL 109707) has been deposited in the Herbarium Mediterraneum Panormitanum of the Orto Botanico, University of Palermo, Italy.
