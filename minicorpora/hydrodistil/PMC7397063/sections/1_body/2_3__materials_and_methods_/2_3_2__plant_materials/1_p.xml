<p>Aerial parts of 
 <italic>F. nodosa</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>geniculata</italic> were harvested in April 2019, immediately before flowering, from different plants growing on a flat-lying litho-soil near Noto Antica, Syracuse, (Sicily, Italy) (36°57′27.37” N; 15°02′18.76” E) of 378 m above sea level. This plant has a distribution limited to the southeastern sector of Sicily, in particular the complex of the Iblei Mountains. It is a circular-limestone plateau of circular shape, dating back to the Miocene, in which the presence of numerous streams dug deep incisions (canyons), locally known as “cave iblee”. The bioclimate of the area is thermo-Mediterranean dry, which favors both aspects of thermo-xerophilous pine forest (
 <italic>Pinus halepensis</italic> and 
 <italic>Coridothymus capitatus</italic>) and all aspects of mesophilic shrub (
 <italic>Myrtus communis</italic>, 
 <italic>Arbutus unedo</italic>, and 
 <italic>Pistacia lentiscus</italic>). Samples were identified by Prof. Vincenzo Ilardi, University of Palermo, Italy. A voucher specimen (PAL 109707) has been deposited in the Herbarium Mediterraneum Panormitanum of the “Orto Botanico”, University of Palermo, Italy.
