0: Oxidative stress is defined as an imbalance between the production of Radical Oxygen Species (ROS) and the antioxidant defensive mechanisms in our bodies, that results in the development of pathological conditions such as pre-diabetes [ 5, 6].
1: It was reported that 510% of people per year with pre-diabetes would progress to diabetes and its associated complications, such as obesity [ 6].
2: Therapeutic implications of the pre-diabetes condition include the inhibition of -amylase and -glucosidase enzyme suppressing postprandial hyperglycemia and reduced dietary carbohydrate digestion and absorption [ 7].
3: In addition, inhibition of pancreatic lipase, with a reduction of fat absorption, is a therapeutic strategy to reduce the risk of obesity [ 8].
4: Thus, natural inhibitors of these enzymes and antioxidant agents from dietary plants may be proposed as an effective therapy for management of post-prandial hyperglycemia and obesity diseases.
