<p>Oxidative stress is defined as an imbalance between the production of Radical Oxygen Species (ROS) and the antioxidant defensive mechanisms in our bodies, that results in the development of pathological conditions such as pre-diabetes [

 <xref rid="B8-molecules-25-03249" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Thus, natural inhibitors of these enzymes and antioxidant agents from dietary plants may be proposed as an effective therapy for management of post-prandial hyperglycemia and obesity diseases.
