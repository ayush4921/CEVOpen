<p>The major components of essential oil were 2,3,6-trimethyl benzaldehyde, spathulenol, (
 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene, and caryophyllene oxide. Among monoterpenoids, bornyl acetate and Î±-pinene were the most representative compounds. 
 <italic>F. nodosa</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>geniculata</italic> essential oil showed, also, an interesting antioxidant potential, with particular reference to ABTS testing. Additionally, hypoglycemic and antilipidemic effects were evaluated with interesting activity against lipase. Obtained data demonstrated that 
 <italic>F. nodosa</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>geniculata</italic> essential oil could be considered a promising phytocomplex useful for formulation of nutraceutical products to prevent diseases associated with oxidative stress, such as type 2 diabetes and obesity.
