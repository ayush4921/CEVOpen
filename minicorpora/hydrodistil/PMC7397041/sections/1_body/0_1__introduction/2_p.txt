0: A number of recent studies on the volatile composition of  Etlingera spp.
1: focus on the essential oil obtained either by steam distillation or hydrodistillation, as well as others by basic extraction techniques involving the use of organic solvents.
2: However, there are relatively few studies on the volatile compounds of Zingiberaceae extracts obtained using alternative methods, such as headspace solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC/MS.
3: The HS-SPME-GC/MS is increasingly used for fast and automatic extraction coupled with a high-throughput analysis of a large number of volatile compounds in a single step without involving the use of solvents [ 6, 7].
4: Despite many traditional uses and medicinal claims of different species of  Etlingera, very few scientific studies have focused on the essential oil.
5: Particularly, the mode of action of the essential oils was much less mentioned.
6: As far as we know, no information is available on the investigation into these antimicrobial mechanisms using Synchrotron FTIR microspectroscopy.
7: Thus, this research aimed to extract the volatile compounds from  E. pavieana analyze the antimicrobial activity of the extract and investigate the mechanism of its action against pathogenic bacteria present in ready-to-eat (RTE) products so that the extract can be used as a natural food preservative.
