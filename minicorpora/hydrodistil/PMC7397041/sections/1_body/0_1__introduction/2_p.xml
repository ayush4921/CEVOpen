<p>A number of recent studies on the volatile composition of 
 <italic>Etlingera</italic> spp. focus on the essential oil obtained either by steam distillation or hydrodistillation, as well as others by basic extraction techniques involving the use of organic solvents. However, there are relatively few studies on the volatile compounds of Zingiberaceae extracts obtained using alternative methods, such as headspace solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC/MS. The HS-SPME-GC/MS is increasingly used for fast and automatic extraction coupled with a high-throughput analysis of a large number of volatile compounds in a single step without involving the use of solvents [

As far as we know, no information is available on the investigation into these antimicrobial mechanisms using Synchrotron FTIR microspectroscopy. Thus, this research aimed to extract the volatile compounds from
