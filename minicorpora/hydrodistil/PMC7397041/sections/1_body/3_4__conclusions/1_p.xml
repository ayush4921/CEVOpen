<p>Essential oils obtained from the 
 <italic>E. pavieana</italic> rhizome contain high 
 <italic>trans</italic>-anethole and estragole content, allowing them to inhibit Gram-positive bacteria associated with ready-to-eat (RTE) foods, namely 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes, B. cereus</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. The main active compounds reacted mostly with the cell plasma membrane, causing the DNA/nucleic acid and protein to leak. This study provides the benefit of using EOEP as a natural food preservative in certain liquid foods system.
