<p>The FTIR micrographs revealed the change in cellular components in the spectral intensity at the dominant peaks at 3295, 2925, 2851, 1657, 1541, 1444, 1400, 1240 and 1085 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. Overall, the cells show significant changes after being treated with EOEP for 6–12 h (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05). After cells were treated for 6 h, the most apparent change occurs at the DNA/nucleic acid region where the absorptions of bands 1240 and 1085 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> increase about 4- and 3-fold, respectively. The band at 1240 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> represented the phosphate group (P=O) asymmetric stretching of phosphodiesters in phospholipids and RNA [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-25-03245" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-25-03245" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and 1085 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> represented a phosphate symmetric stretching in DNA, RNA and phospholipids [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-25-03245" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-25-03245" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. We also observed a 2-fold increase in the Amide I of α-helical structures (1650 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>), the Amide I of β-pleated sheet structures (1630 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>) and the Amide II (1541 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>) region after 6 and 12 h of treatment, respectively [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-25-03245" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-25-03245" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Moreover, we hypothesized a major disruption in the cell membrane due to the change in the two absorbance bands at 1400 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and 1444 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, with the former attributed to the symmetric stretching of the COO-group in amino acids and fatty acids in the cell membrane [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-25-03245" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and the deformation of the CH
 <sub>2</sub> of lipids and fatty acids in the cell membrane [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-25-03245" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The increase in the spectra at 1650, 1541, 1444, 1400, 1240 and 1085 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> suggests a leakage of cellular components. These changes generally reflect changes in the cell membrane and the leakage of the nucleic acids into the solvent. These results showed the most substantial cellular biomolecule changes in phosphodiesters in nucleic acid, including DNA and RNA, followed by cell membrane and proteinaceous substances after being treated with EOEP for 6 h.
