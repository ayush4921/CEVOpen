<p>The effect of EOEP on the cellular components of 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> was investigated by Synchrotron FTIR microspectroscopy. FTIR spectra of cells treated with 0.1% EOEP for 0, 6 and 12 h are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03245-f004">Figure 4</xref>A. The FTIR spectra for most bacteria were divided into four regions comprising the fatty acid in the cell (Region I; peak from 3000 to 2800 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>), the amide groups from proteins and peptides (Region II; peak from 1700–1500 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>), the mixed region governed by fatty acids, proteins and phosphate-carrying molecules (Region III; peak from 1500–1200 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>) and nucleic acid, DNA and RNA (Region IV; peak from 1200–1000 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>) [

 <italic>B. cereus</italic> corresponded to those previously described [

 <xref rid="B34-molecules-25-03245" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Strong absorption units obtained for all regions, demonstrating the main components of a cell. To assess the detailed structure of the FTIR spectra and characterize the related variations among bacterial FTIR spectra, the second derivative was analyzed, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03245-f004">Figure 4</xref>B,C. The representative FTIR band assignments of biomolecule groups are shown in
