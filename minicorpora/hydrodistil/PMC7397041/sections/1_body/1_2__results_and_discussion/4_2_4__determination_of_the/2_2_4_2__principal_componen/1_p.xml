<p>We conducted PCA to justify this multivariate data set and differentiate changes between untreated cells and treated cells. Here, we showed clear data segregations between untreated cells and treated cells of the scores for the PC1 (variability; 60%) and PC2 (variability; 23%), as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03245-f005">Figure 5</xref>. The PCA score plot shows that spectra from a cell treated with 0.1% EOEP for 0, 6 and 12 h on 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> can be clustered separately along PC1 and PC2. Moreover, a grouping of the spectra represents significant differences between untreated (0 min) and treated cells (6 and 12 h) that can be correlated with changes in the molecular composition of 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic>, including fatty acid (2925 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>), protein (1630 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>), and mixed region, which characterizes the cell membrane and DNA/nucleic acids (1240 and 1085 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>). The PCA results correspond to the time-kill assay, as previously described, as the EOEP at concentration 0.1% showed bactericidal effect against 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> within 6 h and continuously throughout 12 h. Interestingly, the negative and positive spectral variations indicated by the PC1 and PC2 loading plots that were oppositely correlated to each other at 1630 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> may indicate a higher level of amide I of β-pleated sheet structures in the proteinaceous content of treated cells compared to untreated cells. Additionally, the oppositely correlated PC1 and PC2 at 1240 and 1085 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> may reflect considerable level of nucleic acids, DNA and RNA of the treated and untreated cells. Our findings reveal the mode of action of the EOEP targeted on the phosphodiester of the nucleic acids, including DNA and RNA and the proteinaceous substances of cells, in particular, amide I.
