<p>Though reports on the antimicrobial activity of EOEP are limited, its inhibitory activity against test bacteria could be attributed to the presence of bioactive compounds, mainly 
 <italic>trans</italic>-anethole and methyl chavicol (estragole), as previously reported [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-25-03245" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-25-03245" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-25-03245" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-25-03245" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-25-03245" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. 
 <italic>Trans</italic>-Anethole at a concentration of 75 Î¼g/mL showed clear inhibition of the growth of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> at inoculum level of 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/plate [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-25-03245" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Estragole had a strong inhibitory effect against 
 <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> in the liquid culture assay throughout 24 h. The effectiveness of estragole was stronger than eugenol &gt; methyl-eugenol &gt; cinnamaldehyde, respectively [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-25-03245" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Moreover, the antibacterial activity of estragole is comparatively higher than that of 
 <italic>trans</italic>-anethole [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-25-03245" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The estragole-rich oil exhibited MICs of 3.7, 6.7 and 13.2 mg/mL against 
 <italic>C. albican</italic>, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli,</italic> respectively, while 
 <italic>trans</italic>-anethole-rich oil showed a MIC of 1.8 mg/mL against 
 <italic>C. albican</italic>. In contrast, the antioxidative activity of estragole is comparatively less than 
 <italic>trans</italic>-anethole [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-25-03245" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Nonetheless, it has been shown to carry antioxidative activity. Both 
 <italic>trans</italic>-anethole and methyl chavicol (estragole) have shown both antioxidant and antimicrobial activities, but very little is known about their modes of action against target microorganisms.
