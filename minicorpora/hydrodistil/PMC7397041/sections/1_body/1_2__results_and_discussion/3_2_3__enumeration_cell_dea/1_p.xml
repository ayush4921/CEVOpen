<p>Time-kill assay of EOEP against the tested bacterial species was performed to determine the response on the growth pattern. Based on the MIC and MBC values, six concentrations of EOEP were tested against foodborne pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria, including 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic>, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes,</italic> at an initial concentration of ca. 3 log CFU/mL. The bacterial viable cells were enumerated over time to investigate their response to the antimicrobial agent, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03245-f003">Figure 3</xref>. The bacteriostatic (the concentration where the bacterial culture remains constant) and bactericidal (the concentration where the bacteria dies at no viable count in 18h) concentrations can be determined from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03245-f003">Figure 3</xref> [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-25-03245" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. All bacterial strains grew well in the control sample (non-selective media without the addition of EOEP). The cell numbers of 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> in the control (TSB without EOEP) reached 9 Log CFU/mL in 12 h, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03245-f003">Figure 3</xref>A,B. When 0.01% EOEP was added to the broth medium, 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> cells grew to 9 Log CFU/mL in 12 h, which was similar to the control. In 0.03% EOEP, the bacterial cell count remained constant at ca. 2 log CFU/mL for 12 h and then increased to 8 Log CFU/mL after 18 h. On the other hand, bactericidal effect was detected at an EOEP concentration of 0.05% as the number of cells gradually reduced to undetectable levels within 18 h. Furthermore, at a concentration of 0.15%, the number of 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> cells became undetectable within 12 h. The response of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> to 0.01 and 0.03% EOEP was similar to 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic>, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03245-f003">Figure 3</xref>B. In the case where 0.05% EOEP was applied, it showed a bacteriostatic effect, as seen in the fact that the cell numbers remained constant at ca. 2 log CFU/mL throughout the study. At 0.10 and 0.15%, EOEP became bactericidal, and the number of cells reduced to undetectable amounts within 24 and 18 h, respectively. The response of 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> to EOEP was more sensitive than other species, as it showed bacteriostatic effect at 0.03% EOEP, and became bactericidal at 0.05% EOEP. The 
 <italic>listerial</italic> cell was completely inactivated at 0.10% EOEP within 24 h, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03245-f003">Figure 3</xref>C. In summary, time-kill curves revealed the dynamic response of the bacterial cells on the growth pattern at an EOEP concentration of 0.01%, which showed an inhibitory effect against 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic>, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>monocytogenes</italic> Scott A. At a concentration of 0.03%, EOEP showed bacteriostatic effect and, at 0.1% or greater, EOEP showed lethal effect.
