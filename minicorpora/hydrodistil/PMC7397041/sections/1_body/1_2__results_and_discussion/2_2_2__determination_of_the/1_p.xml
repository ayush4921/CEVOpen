<p>The antimicrobial activity of EOEP from the rhizome against foodborne microorganisms was assessed by MIC and MBC values investigated by broth dilution assay, as shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-03245-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The results show that EOEP has a stronger antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria than Gram-negative bacteria. The MIC and MBC values against Gram-positive bacteria range between 0.02 to 0.03% (
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) and 0.10 to 0.30% (
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>), respectively, while the MIC and MBC values against most Gram-negative bacteria and lactic acid bacteria are 5% (
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) or greater. Thus, this EOEP is not strongly effective against Gram-negative bacteria. Amongst the bacteria tested, 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> strain 108 and Scott A were found to be most sensitive strains with the MIC and MBC values of 0.02% (
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) and 0.10% (
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>), respectively, followed by 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic>, which gave values of 0.02% and 0.15% (
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>), respectively. The antimicrobial activity of the 
 <italic>E. pavieana</italic> essential oil has been reported in few studies. There was only one report on the biological activities of the 
 <italic>E. pavieana</italic> essential oil and, although it showed cytotoxic activity on human small-cell lung cancer (NCI-H187) cells with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 31.69 Î¼g/mL, it was inactive against 
 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-25-03245" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. From our previous publication, various solvent extracts of 
 <italic>E. pavieana,</italic> including ethanol, acetone, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, petroleum ether and hexane, had antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria 
 <italic>(Bacillus cereus</italic>, 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>) and Gram-negative bacteria (
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</italic> and 
 <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-25-03245" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Comparing the antimicrobial activity of the 
 <italic>Etlingera</italic> essential oils, the essential oils from 
 <italic>E. elatior</italic>, 
 <italic>Etlingera fulgens</italic>, 
 <italic>Etlingera maingayi, E. punicea</italic> and 
 <italic>Etlingera rubrostriata</italic> had antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, namely 
 <italic>B. cereus, Micrococcus luteus</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-25-03245" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-25-03245" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-25-03245" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Moreover, the essential oil of 
 <italic>E. elatior</italic> flowers and 
 <italic>E. punicea</italic> had antifungal activity against 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-25-03245" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-25-03245" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, those essential oils were ineffective against Gram-negative bacteria, including 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella albany</italic> and 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> Choleraesuis. These reports correspond to the findings we have presented above. It has been generally reported that Gram-negative bacteria are more resistant to antimicrobial agents due to the lipopolysaccharide layer on the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria being highly hydrophilic. This acts as a strong barrier against hydrophobic molecules, which are the majority of the antimicrobial agents. In contrast, the cell walls of the Gram-positive bacteria only consist of thick peptidoglycan, which make the bacteria more susceptible to attack by the antibacterial agents [

 <xref rid="B22-molecules-25-03245" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Interestingly, lactic acid bacteria, which are mostly Gram-positive, are more resistant to EO than the other Gram-positive members [

 <xref rid="B26-molecules-25-03245" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This effect may be due to the surface of the lactic acid bacteria, including 
 <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> spp., which are able to provide intrinsic resistance to some antibacterial agents [
