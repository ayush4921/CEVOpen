<p>The volatile compositions of EOEP from the rhizome were characterized by a headspace solid-phase microextraction system (HS-SPME) using a 50/30 μm divinylbenzene (DVB)/ polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) fiber (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA), according to the method of Morales-Soto et al. [

 <xref rid="B6-molecules-25-03245" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] with some modifications. The EOEP, 0.5 g, was weighed and 4.5 mL of ethyl ether was added to a SMPE vial of 15 mL fitted with a screw cap. After equilibration at 40 °C for 10 min, the fiber was exposed to the headspace above the sample for 30 min. The sample was kept under stirring at 40 °C and desorbed for 20 min in the GC injector at 250 °C. Analysis was done in triplicate. The GC-MS analysis of SPME extracts was carried out as described by Morales-Soto et al. [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-25-03245" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Briefly, the volatile compounds were identified by comparison with mass spectra from NIST/EPA/NIH databases and confirmed in many cases by the comparison of their retention indices with databases (
 <uri xlink:href="http://www.pherobase.com" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.pherobase.com</uri>) and the ADAMS library. To confirm the identification, the linear retention index (LRI) was calculated for each volatile, using the retention times of a homologous series of C6–C25 
 <italic>n</italic>-alkanes. Semiquantitative determinations were expressed as the percentage of total peak area within each sample.
