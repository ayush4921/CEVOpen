0: The volatile compositions of EOEP from the rhizome were characterized by a headspace solid-phase microextraction system (HS-SPME) using a 50/30 m divinylbenzene (DVB)/ polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) fiber (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA), according to the method of Morales-Soto et al.
1: [ 5] and Saoudi et al.
2: [ 6] with some modifications.
3: The EOEP, 0.5 g, was weighed and 4.5 mL of ethyl ether was added to a SMPE vial of 15 mL fitted with a screw cap.
4: After equilibration at 40 C for 10 min, the fiber was exposed to the headspace above the sample for 30 min.
5: The sample was kept under stirring at 40 C and desorbed for 20 min in the GC injector at 250 C. Analysis was done in triplicate.
6: The GC-MS analysis of SPME extracts was carried out as described by Morales-Soto et al.
7: [ 5].
8: Briefly, the volatile compounds were identified by comparison with mass spectra from NIST/EPA/NIH databases and confirmed in many cases by the comparison of their retention indices with databases ( http://www.pherobase.com) and the ADAMS library.
9: To confirm the identification, the linear retention index (LRI) was calculated for each volatile, using the retention times of a homologous series of C6C25  n-alkanes.
10: Semiquantitative determinations were expressed as the percentage of total peak area within each sample.
