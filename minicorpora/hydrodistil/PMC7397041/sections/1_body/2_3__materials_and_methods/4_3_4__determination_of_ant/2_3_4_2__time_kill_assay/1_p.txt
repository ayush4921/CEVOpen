0: The antimicrobial activity of EOEP over time was determined against  B. cereus,  S. aureus and  L. monocytogenes Scott A.
1: This method was modified from Thongson, et al.
2: [ 48] and Ekkarin, et al.
3: [ 49].
4: B. cereus and  S. aureus were grown in TSB and  L. monocytogenes Scott A was grown in TSBYE for 18 h and serially diluted into 10 mL double strength broth media, which was contained in a 125 mL Erlenmeyer flask.
5: Then, a certain amount of EOEP was added to maintain the concentration at 0 (a positive control), 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.15% ( v/ v).
6: Sterile distilled water was then added to adjust the total volume to 20 mL.
7: The final concentration of the initial cell was 3 Log CFU/mL.
8: All flasks were incubated at 37 C, except  B. cereus, which was incubated at 30 C in a shaker at 100 rpm for up to 24 h. Numbers of survivor were taken at 0, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 h and viable cells were enumerated on agar media.
9: All experiments were repeated in triplicate and duplicated in a single repeat.
