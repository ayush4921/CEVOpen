<p>The antimicrobial activity of EOEP over time was determined against 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic>, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> Scott A. This method was modified from Thongson, et al. [

 <xref rid="B49-molecules-25-03245" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> were grown in TSB and 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> Scott A was grown in TSBYE for 18 h and serially diluted into 10 mL double strength broth media, which was contained in a 125 mL Erlenmeyer flask. Then, a certain amount of EOEP was added to maintain the concentration at 0 (a positive control), 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.15% (
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>). Sterile distilled water was then added to adjust the total volume to 20 mL. The final concentration of the initial cell was 3 Log CFU/mL. All flasks were incubated at 37 °C, except 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic>, which was incubated at 30 °C in a shaker at 100 rpm for up to 24 h. Numbers of survivor were taken at 0, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 h and viable cells were enumerated on agar media. All experiments were repeated in triplicate and duplicated in a single repeat.
