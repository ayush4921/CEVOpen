0: The broth dilution method was used for determining both the MIC and MBC of the EOEP against all strains of tested bacteria.
1: This method was used as modified from Sukmark et al.
2: [ 46].
3: Test tubes containing 5 mL of each bacterium (45 Log CFU/mL) and double strength MuellerHinton broth (MHB; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), MHBYE for  Listeria spp.
4: or MRS broth for lactic acid bacteria were mixed to a single concentration in either EOEP or sterilized deionized (DI) water to give a final volume of 10 mL.
5: The EOEP was mixed into a test tube to give a final concentration in the range of 0.01 to 5% ( v/ v).
6: The methodology also included positive and negative controls.
7: The positive control included tubes containing inoculum and MHB medium without EOEP, and the negative control comprised tubes containing EOEP and MHB medium, without inoculum.
8: The test tubes with only MHB medium served as a blank control.
9: After mixing, the test tubes were incubated at 37 C, except  B. cereus was incubated at 30 C for 24 h. Survival numbers of tested bacteria were examined using the spread plate method.
10: B. cereus,  S. aureus,  E. coli,  P. aeruginosa and  S. Typhimurium were grown on TSA.
11: Listeria spp.
12: was grown on TSAYE and lactic acid bacteria was grown in MRS agar.
13: Then, the agar was incubated at 37 C, while  B. cereus was incubated at 30 C. All experiments were repeated in triplicate and duplicated in each experiment.
