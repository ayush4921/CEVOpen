<p>The broth dilution method was used for determining both the MIC and MBC of the EOEP against all strains of tested bacteria. This method was used as modified from Sukmark et al. [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-25-03245" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Test tubes containing 5 mL of each bacterium (4–5 Log CFU/mL) and double strength Mueller–Hinton broth (MHB; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), MHBYE for 
 <italic>Listeria</italic> spp. or MRS broth for lactic acid bacteria were mixed to a single concentration in either EOEP or sterilized deionized (DI) water to give a final volume of 10 mL. The EOEP was mixed into a test tube to give a final concentration in the range of 0.01 to 5% (
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>). The methodology also included positive and negative controls. The positive control included tubes containing inoculum and MHB medium without EOEP, and the negative control comprised tubes containing EOEP and MHB medium, without inoculum. The test tubes with only MHB medium served as a blank control. After mixing, the test tubes were incubated at 37 °C, except 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> was incubated at 30 °C for 24 h. Survival numbers of tested bacteria were examined using the spread plate method. 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic>, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium were grown on TSA. 
 <italic>Listeria</italic> spp. was grown on TSAYE and lactic acid bacteria was grown in MRS agar. Then, the agar was incubated at 37 °C, while 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> was incubated at 30 °C. All experiments were repeated in triplicate and duplicated in each experiment.
