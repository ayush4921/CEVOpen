<p>In total, we tested 17 strains of foodborne microorganisms. These include Gram-positive bacteria, namely 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> TISTR687, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> TISTR1466, 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> strain 101, 108, V7 and Scott A, lactic acid bacteria, namely 
 <italic>L. pentosus</italic> TISTR920, 
 <italic>L. plantarum</italic> strains TISTR541, TISTR844 and TISTR850, 
 <italic>L. mesenteroides</italic> TISTR053 and 
 <italic>P. cerevisiae</italic> and, finally, Gram-negative bacteria, namely 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> TISTR780, 
 <italic>S. enterica</italic> serotype Typhimurium ATCC13311 and 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>aeruginosa</italic> TISTR781. For the culture preparation, 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic>, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>S.</italic> Typhimurium and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> were grown in TSB at 37 °C, except for 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic>, which was cultured at 30 °C. 
 <italic>Listeria</italic> spp. was grown in TSB containing 0.6% yeast extract (YE) at 37 °C and lactic acid bacteria were grown in MRS broth. The culture was then subjected to two successive 24 h and 18 h transfers before use.
