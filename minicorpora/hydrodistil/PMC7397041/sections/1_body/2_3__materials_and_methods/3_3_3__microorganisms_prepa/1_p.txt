0: In total, we tested 17 strains of foodborne microorganisms.
1: These include Gram-positive bacteria, namely  B. cereus TISTR687,  S. aureus TISTR1466,  L. monocytogenes strain 101, 108, V7 and Scott A, lactic acid bacteria, namely  L. pentosus TISTR920,  L. plantarum strains TISTR541, TISTR844 and TISTR850,  L. mesenteroides TISTR053 and  P. cerevisiae and, finally, Gram-negative bacteria, namely  E. coli TISTR780,  S. enterica serotype Typhimurium ATCC13311 and  P.  aeruginosa TISTR781.
2: For the culture preparation,  B. cereus,  S. aureus,  S. Typhimurium and  P. aeruginosa were grown in TSB at 37 C, except for  B. cereus, which was cultured at 30 C.  Listeria spp.
3: was grown in TSB containing 0.6% yeast extract (YE) at 37 C and lactic acid bacteria were grown in MRS broth.
4: The culture was then subjected to two successive 24 h and 18 h transfers before use.
