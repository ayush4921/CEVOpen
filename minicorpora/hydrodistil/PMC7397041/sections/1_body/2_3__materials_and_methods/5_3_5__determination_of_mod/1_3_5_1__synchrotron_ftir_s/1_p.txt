0: B. cereus cells were grown at 30 C in TSB medium added with EOEP.
1: The samples were taken immediately after contact with EOEP (0 h), and then after 6 h and 12 h. A 5 l aliquot of  B. cereus was transferred into a new sterile microtube and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 2 min.
2: A pellet was washed twice using sterile 0.85% NaCl and DI water.
3: The suspended culture was placed on an IR-transparent 2-mm-thick barium fluoride (BaF 2) slide.
4: Samples on the slide were dried at room temperature for 2 h under laminar flow for dehydration.
5: The dried samples on the BaF 2 slides were kept in a vacuum and dried before FTIR analysis.
6: The Synchrotron FTIR microspectroscopy was performed at Beamline 4.1 in the Synchrotron Light Research Institute (SLRI, Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand).
7: The FTIR microspectra were obtained from the wavenumber range of 3000800 cm 1.
8: In total, 270 spectra (90 spectra per replicate) were acquired at room temperature.
9: The measurement was performed in the mapping mode using an aperture size 10  10 m with a spectral resolution of 6 cm 1 and 64 scans co-added.
10: Spectral acquisition and instrument control were performed using an OPUS 6.5 (Bruker, Ettlingen, Germany).
