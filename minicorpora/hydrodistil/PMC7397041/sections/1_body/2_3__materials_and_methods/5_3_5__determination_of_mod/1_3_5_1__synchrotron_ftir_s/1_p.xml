 <italic>B. cereus</italic> cells were grown at 30 °C in TSB medium added with EOEP. The samples were taken immediately after contact with EOEP (0 h), and then after 6 h and 12 h. A 5 μl aliquot of 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> was transferred into a new sterile microtube and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 2 min. A pellet was washed twice using sterile 0.85% NaCl and DI water. The suspended culture was placed on an IR-transparent 2-mm-thick barium fluoride (BaF
 <sub>2</sub>) slide. Samples on the slide were dried at room temperature for 2 h under laminar flow for dehydration. The dried samples on the BaF
 <sub>2</sub> slides were kept in a vacuum and dried before FTIR analysis. The Synchrotron FTIR microspectroscopy was performed at Beamline 4.1 in the Synchrotron Light Research Institute (SLRI, Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand). The FTIR microspectra were obtained from the wavenumber range of 3000–800 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. In total, 270 spectra (90 spectra per replicate) were acquired at room temperature. The measurement was performed in the mapping mode using an aperture size 10 × 10 μm with a spectral resolution of 6 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and 64 scans co-added. Spectral acquisition and instrument control were performed using an OPUS 6.5 (Bruker, Ettlingen, Germany).
