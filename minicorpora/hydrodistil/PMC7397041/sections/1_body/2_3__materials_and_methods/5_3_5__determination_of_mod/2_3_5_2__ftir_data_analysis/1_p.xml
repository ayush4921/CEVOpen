<p>Before all spectra of 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> cells were collected each time, background was collected each time. All spectra were nine-point smoothed, normalized, baseline corrected and integrated using the OPUS 6.5 software. A second derivative of the spectrum was calculated using the Savitzkyâ€“Golay algorithm and subjected to the multivariate statistical technique of principal component analysis (PCA) by Unscramble X software (Camo Analytics, Oslo, Norway).
