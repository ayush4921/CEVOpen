Next, different doses of MPEO were added to the pots: 0 (control), 0.1; 0.2; 0.44; 0.66; 0.88 and 1.31 g per pot (equal to 8; 16; 36; 55; 73 and 108 g m
 <sup>−2</sup>) and mixed with the upper part of vermiculite (up to 3-cm deep). On the same day, three seeds of white mustard were seeded in each of the pots (at a depth of a ~1 cm) and after emergence they were thinned to two per pot.
