0: Based on the growth parameters of mustard in the first experiment, the next experiment with soil as a substrate, was set up.
1: In this experiment, a top layer (~20-cm deep) of a clay-loamy soil was collected from the organic field during Autumn 2018 at La Saussaye farm near Chartres, France.
2: The soil was kept outside in a box until Spring and then air-dried and sieved through a 2-cm mesh, to remove all the impurifications.
3: The granulometric and chemical analyses of soil were performed in the Laboratoire dAnalyses Chambre dAgriculture Loiret in Orleans, France.
4: The soil based on its texture was classified as a silty clay loam [ 29].
5: It contained: C org12.7 g kg 1; P 2O 586 mg kg 1; K 2O270 mg kg 1; N total1.38 g kg 1; pH7.93.
6: Different doses of MPEO were added to pots containing the soil: 0 (control), 0.44; 0.66; 0.88, 1.31 and 1.76 g per pot (equal to 36; 55; 73; 108; 145 g m 2) and mixed with the upper part (~3-cm deep) of the soil-substrate.
7: Analogically, as for the first experiment, on the same day three seeds of white mustard were seeded in each of the pots and after emergence thinned to two per pot.
