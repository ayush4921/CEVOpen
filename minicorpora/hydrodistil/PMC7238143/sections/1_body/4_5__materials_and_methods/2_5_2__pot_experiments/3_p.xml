<p>Based on the growth parameters of mustard in the first experiment, the next experiment with soil as a substrate, was set up. In this experiment, a top layer (~20-cm deep) of a clay-loamy soil was collected from the organic field during Autumn 2018 at La Saussaye farm near Chartres, France. The soil was kept outside in a box until Spring and then air-dried and sieved through a 2-cm mesh, to remove all the impurifications. The granulometric and chemical analyses of soil were performed in the Laboratoire d’Analyses Chambre d’Agriculture Loiret in Orleans, France. The soil based on its texture was classified as a silty clay loam [
