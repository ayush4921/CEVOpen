0: From the experiment with the soil substrate, three plants were used for the biochemical analyses.
1: Methanolic extracts (50%) of lyophilized aboveground parts of mustard were prepared using ultrasound-assisted extraction for 60 min (Prolab Instruments GmbH, Kanton Reinach, Switzerland).
2: The biochemical analyses were performed in two technical repetitions and included photocolorimetric analyses (BioTek Instruments Inc., Winooski, VT, USA), using 96-micro well plates.
3: The FolinCiocalteu assay of total phenolic content with absorbance readings at 630 nm was taken after incubation and expressed in gallic acid as a reference phenolic [ 30]; total anthocyanins were measured using the pH differential method at 450 nm [ 31].
