<p>Both experiments were terminated when the white mustard plants reached the growth stage of two pairs of true leaves (BBCH 14), which took ~8 weeks, as the emergence of plants was registered ~10–12 days after seeding. The plants were removed from the pots and their roots were carefully washed under tap water. The measured parameters of fresh plants included: length of shoots, length of roots (for the vermiculate experiment only) and fresh mass of shoots and roots. Also, a dry mass of shoots and roots of mustard was measured, after drying plants in 105 °C for 24 h.</p>
