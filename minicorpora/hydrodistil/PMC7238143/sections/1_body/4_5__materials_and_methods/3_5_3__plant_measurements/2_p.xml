<p>From the experiment with the soil substrate, three plants were used for the biochemical analyses. Methanolic extracts (50%) of lyophilized aboveground parts of mustard were prepared using ultrasound-assisted extraction for 60 min (Prolab Instruments GmbH, Kanton Reinach, Switzerland). The biochemical analyses were performed in two technical repetitions and included photocolorimetric analyses (BioTek Instruments Inc., Winooski, VT, USA), using 96-micro well plates. The Folinâ€“Ciocalteu assay of total phenolic content with absorbance readings at 630 nm was taken after incubation and expressed in gallic acid as a reference phenolic [
