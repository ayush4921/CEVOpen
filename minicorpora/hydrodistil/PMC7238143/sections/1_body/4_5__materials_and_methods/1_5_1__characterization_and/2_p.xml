<p>The content of peppermint EO in the microcapsules was measured three times by the hydrodistillation method (10 g of microcapsules and 100 mL of water) for 2 h, using a Clevenger-type apparatus. The volume of the separated EO was multiplied by the specific density of the microcapsules, which was determined by the pycnometer method. Essential oil was analyzed by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-FID-MS), using a Trace GC Ultra gas chromatograph coupled with DSQ II mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron Corporation). The operating conditions were as follows: non-polar capillary column Rtx-1ms (60 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 m film thickness), programmed temperature: 50 (3 min)–300 °C, 4 °C/min, injector (SSL) temperature 280 °C, detector (FID) temperature 300 °C, transfer line temperature 250 °C, carrier gas-helium, flow with constant pressure 200 kPa, split ratio 1:20. The mass spectrometer parameters: ion source temperature 200 °C, ionization energy 70 eV (EI), scan mode: full scan, mass range 33–420. The percentages of constituents were computed from the GC peak area without using a correction factor.</p>
