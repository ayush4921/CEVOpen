<p>The experiment with vermiculate was set up in two series, which begun on 11 April and on 22 April 2019, respectively; whereas the experiment with soil was set up on 27 May 2019. Both pot experiments were set up in a totally randomized design, with four replications (pots) for the experiment with vermiculate and three replications (pots) for the experiment with the soil substrate. Each pot contained two plants of white mustard. Since no significant differences between the two series of the experiment with vermiculate were found, the data were pooled. The statistical analysis was based on ANOVA (software Statistica PL version 13.0, StatSoft). To meet the requirements of ANOVA namely normality of the distribution, the data for shoot and root length were square root transformed. Means were compared using Tukey HSD test at
