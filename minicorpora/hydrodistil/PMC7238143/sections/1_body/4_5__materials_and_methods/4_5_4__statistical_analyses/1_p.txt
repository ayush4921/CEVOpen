0: The experiment with vermiculate was set up in two series, which begun on 11 April and on 22 April 2019, respectively; whereas the experiment with soil was set up on 27 May 2019.
1: Both pot experiments were set up in a totally randomized design, with four replications (pots) for the experiment with vermiculate and three replications (pots) for the experiment with the soil substrate.
2: Each pot contained two plants of white mustard.
3: Since no significant differences between the two series of the experiment with vermiculate were found, the data were pooled.
4: The statistical analysis was based on ANOVA (software Statistica PL version 13.0, StatSoft).
5: To meet the requirements of ANOVA namely normality of the distribution, the data for shoot and root length were square root transformed.
6: Means were compared using Tukey HSD test at  p< 0.05.
7: The ED50 and ED90 values were calculated using the drc package in the RStudio (ver.
8: 1.2.5033) software [ 32].
