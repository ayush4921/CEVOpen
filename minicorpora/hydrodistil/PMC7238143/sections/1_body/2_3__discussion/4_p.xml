<p>At the same time, the question raises about the mechanisms of tolerance of mustard to the soil-applied peppermint oil. The biochemical tests performed in this experiment showed, that there was a significant increase in the content of total anthocyanins in the mustard’s tissues in the presence of the two highest doses of the MPEO. This phenomenon is supportive for the induction of stress-alleviating mechanisms in mustard due to phytotoxic action of the MPEO. As was showed in the other experiments, anthocyanins’ production increases in the presence of different types of stresses [

Indeed, the presence of these compounds can ameliorate plant performances reducing the excess lighting striking chloroplast when the photosynthetic apparatus is under sub-optimal conditions (e.g., MPEO-triggered biochemical and physiological effects) as observed in other experiments dealing with environmental stresses [
