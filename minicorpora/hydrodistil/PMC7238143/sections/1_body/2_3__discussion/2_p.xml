<p>The results revealed that the fresh mass of roots of mustard was most reduced in the presence of soil applied MPEO, regardless of the type of medium. It could be speculated, that both phytotoxic peppermint EO, but also its carrier—maltodextrin, could be a reason for that phenomena. As was shown in the other experiment, peppermint oil affects the growth of radicles more, as compared to the growth of shoots [

It can by hypothesized that its addition to the soil medium could impair the sorption of water by the mustard roots, by potentially leading to an osmotic stress. That could be a reason of a lower fresh biomass of roots, which were poorly hydrated. This could potentially reduce the amount of water transported to the shoots, however, regardless of the type of growth medium used in this experiment, the growth of mustard cv. ‘Zlata’ was unaffected by the presence of lower doses of MPEO, up to 55 and 73 g m
 <sup>−2</sup> for vermiculate and soil, respectively. Only the highest doses of MPEO, namely 73 and 108 g m
 <sup>−2</sup> in the vermiculate experiment and 108 and 145 g m
 <sup>−2</sup> in the soil experiment affected significantly both growth and biomass accumulation of mustard’s shoot. Similarly, in the field experiment carried out on brown podzolic soil, the inhibitory effect of maltodextrin (in doses of 50 and 100 g m
 <sup>−2</sup>) on the dry mass of dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous weeds was observed. The authors correlated this effect with possible maltodextrin-caused changes in the activity of soil microbiota, especially a decrease in the number of colonies of mesophilic bacteria, fungi and actinomycetes [
