<p>The chemical composition of microencapsulated peppermint EO (MPEO) studied in this experiment was in general in accordance with the recommendations of the European Pharmacopoeia [
 <xref rid="B18-plants-09-00448" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], with monoterpene alcohol—menthol and monoterpene aldehyde—menthone, being its main compounds. At the same time, two compounds of the EO had an atypical concentration. First, the analyzed EO lacked limonene oxide and secondly—it contained higher amounts of menthol, as those recommended by the European Pharmacopoeia [
 <xref rid="B18-plants-09-00448" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These differences could result from the previous processing of the EO namely its microencapsulation and further its hydrodistillation.
