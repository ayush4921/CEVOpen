<p>It was also shown that mustard growing in the presence of vermiculate was higher and had a more hydrated tissues but also it accumulated less biomass, as compared to the mustard growing in the silty clay loam soil substrate. Actually, mustard was more tolerant to the presence of MPEO in the soil than in the vermiculite. Vermiculite has a good capacity to store water in a way that is easily available for plants [

On the other hand, silty clay loam soil, used in this experiment, contained high amounts of nutrients, which promoted the buildup of plants’ biomass. Similar relationships of biomass accumulation and plants’ length of cucumber seedlings in the presence of vermiculate as compared to the other types of growth media were noted by Kleifeld and Chet [
