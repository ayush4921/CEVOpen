<p>In this experiment, we tested whether the peppermint oil microencapsulated in maltodextrin displays the phytotoxic potential against white mustard (
 <italic>Sinapis alba</italic> L., cv. Zlata) growing in vermiculate or in the top layer of an agronomic soil. White mustard has been chosen as a model “weed” species. It has been used for that purpose in the other experiments, as it is characterized by intensive growth and competition abilities against the other crops [

 <xref rid="B17-plants-09-00448" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] for comparison with the agricultural soil, common in the region of Chartres, France. A hypothesis was formulated, that the type of growth medium affects the phytotoxic potential of microencapsulated essential oil against white mustard, which is dose dependent.
