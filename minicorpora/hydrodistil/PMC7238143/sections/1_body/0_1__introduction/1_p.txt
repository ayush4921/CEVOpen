0: Peppermint ( Mentha x piperita L.), a natural hybrid of  Mentha aquatica L. and  Mentha spicata L., is cultivated broadly in the world.
1: It is a valuable species due to production of essential oil (EO), applied in different industries [ 1, 2].
2: In vitro studies showed, that peppermint EO displays also significant allelopathic and phytotoxic potential, by inhibiting germination and early growth of various weeds [ 3].
3: This potential is attributed to the main compounds of the peppermint EO-oxygenated monoterpenes, namely menthol and menthone constituting together 45%80% of the oil [ 4].
4: According to Synowiec et al.
5: [ 5], these compounds are mainly responsible for the allelopathic potential of EOs.
6: However, some synergistic effects with the less representative compounds of the EO may also occur [ 6].
