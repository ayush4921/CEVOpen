0: In this experiment, we tested whether the peppermint oil microencapsulated in maltodextrin displays the phytotoxic potential against white mustard ( Sinapis alba L., cv.
1: Zlata) growing in vermiculate or in the top layer of an agronomic soil.
2: White mustard has been chosen as a model weed species.
3: It has been used for that purpose in the other experiments, as it is characterized by intensive growth and competition abilities against the other crops [ 15, 16].
4: Vermiculate, a hydrous phyllosilicate mineral, has been chosen as a neutral growth medium, which is chemically and biologically inert [ 17] for comparison with the agricultural soil, common in the region of Chartres, France.
5: A hypothesis was formulated, that the type of growth medium affects the phytotoxic potential of microencapsulated essential oil against white mustard, which is dose dependent.
