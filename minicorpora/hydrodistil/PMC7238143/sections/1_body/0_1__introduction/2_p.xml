On the other hand, their volatility is a significant constraint, as it leads to the fast evaporation of EOs before they can exert their allelopathic potential. Because of that, different methods, vide carriers, of EOs applications are sought to ensure their effectiveness for pre-emergence weed control. One of the promising venues is the application of EOs as solid preparations i.e., microcapsules or nanocapsules [
 <xref rid="B13-plants-09-00448" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The solid carriers for essential oils tend to be a promising tool, as they enable a precise application and reduce losses of EOs [
 <xref rid="B13-plants-09-00448" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Moreover, they can also extend the biologic action of EOs by a slow release to the soil or growth medium [
