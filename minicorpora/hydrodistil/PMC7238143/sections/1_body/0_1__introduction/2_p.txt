0: Essential oils of plant origin could play in future a significant role in the eco-friendly management of agricultural pests, including weeds [ 7, 8].
1: As natural compounds, they are easily biodegradable in the environment at certain doses [ 9], by soil microbiota [ 10] and display different modes of action, in comparison to the synthetic pesticides [ 11, 12].
2: On the other hand, their volatility is a significant constraint, as it leads to the fast evaporation of EOs before they can exert their allelopathic potential.
3: Because of that, different methods, vide carriers, of EOs applications are sought to ensure their effectiveness for pre-emergence weed control.
4: One of the promising venues is the application of EOs as solid preparations i.e., microcapsules or nanocapsules [ 13].
5: The solid carriers for essential oils tend to be a promising tool, as they enable a precise application and reduce losses of EOs [ 13].
6: Moreover, they can also extend the biologic action of EOs by a slow release to the soil or growth medium [ 3].
7: In the previous pot experiment, it was shown that peppermint EO encapsulated in maltodextrin with a small addition of gum Arabic and mixed with peat and sand (2:1 v/v), significantly inhibited initial growth of  Zea mays L.,  Echinochloa crus-galli (L.) P. Beauv.
8: and  Chenopodium album L., at a dose equal to 20 g per m 2 [ 14].
