<p>In summary, the model “weed”—white mustard cv. Zlata showed a tolerance to the presence of maltodextrin microencapsulated peppermint oil (MPEO) in the vermiculate and silty clay loam soil substrate, up to 55 and 73 g m
 <sup>−2</sup>, respectively. Only the two highest doses of microcapsules, namely 73 and 108 g m
 <sup>−2</sup> in the vermiculate experiment and 108 and 145 g m
 <sup>−2</sup> in the soil experiment, caused a significant decrease of plants height and biomass concentration in shoots and roots. The growth patterns were followed by the biochemical changes in the mustard’s tissues, namely a significant increase of anthocyanin content by about 61%–126%. The increase of anthocyanins points to the induction of defense mechanisms in mustard against the MPEO-triggered stress. MPEO treatment appears as a promising bio-herbicide which can be proficiently exploited for weed control in field. However, further studies on different weeds are necessary to consistently evaluate the target of action of MPEO in plant biochemical and/or physiological pattern(s).
