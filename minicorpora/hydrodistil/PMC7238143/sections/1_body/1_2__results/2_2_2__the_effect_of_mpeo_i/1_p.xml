<p>The growth of white mustard was unaffected by the presence of lower doses of MPEO (0–36 g m
 <sup>−2</sup>), mixed with the vermiculate. A visible drop in the number of emerging plants was observed only for the three highest doses of MPEO, namely 55–108 g m
 <sup>−2</sup> (

Also, a significant reduction of their shoot length, by 57% and 85%, was registered only when the two highest doses of MPEO were incorporated. Elongation of roots was even less susceptible than shoots, as only the highest dose of MPEO (108 g m
 <sup>−2</sup>) caused a significant reduction of root length, by 68% as compared to the untreated control. On the other hand, the accumulation of biomass was more affected by the MPEO treatments and both fresh and dry mass of shoots and roots followed similar patterns. Significant reductions of fresh and dry biomass of shoots were registered for the three highest doses of MPEO, by ~40%, 57% and 90% for the doses of 55, 73 and 108 g m
 <sup>−2</sup>, respectively, as compared to control. The reductions of fresh mass of roots were of 75%, 81% and 84% and the reductions of dry mass of roots were of 46%, 70% and 88%, for the three highest doses of MPEO, respectively, in comparison to control (
