<p>For white mustard growing in the soil substrate, selected biochemical analyses were performed, to correlate the observed growth patterns with biochemical state of plants (
 <xref rid="plants-09-00448-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The higher doses of MPEO in the soil substrate, the higher the content of anthocyanins in the aboveground parts of white mustard. For the individual doses it was on average by about 61%; 100%; 75%; 115% and 126% higher, as compared to the untreated control, however significant differences were noted for the two highest doses of MPEO. Contrary, the content of total phenolic compounds was similar, regardless of the dose of MPEO; and for the two highest doses it was insignificantly higher by about 20%, as compared to the untreated control (
