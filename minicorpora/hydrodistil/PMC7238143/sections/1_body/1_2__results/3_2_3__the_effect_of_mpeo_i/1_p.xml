<p>Similarly, as in the vermiculate experiment, the growth of shoots of white mustard in the silty clay loam soil substrate was affected significantly in the presence of the two highest doses of the MPEO, by 72% and 93% as compared to the non-treated control. Fresh and dry mass of shoots were significantly reduced only by the two highest doses, by 83%–88% and 87%–88% respectively, as compared to control. However, based on the ED50 value, accumulation of biomass in mustard shoots was more affected than shoot elongation under MPEO treatment (
