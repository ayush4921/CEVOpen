<p>The fresh mass of roots was a parameter of a highest susceptibility to the presence of MPEO in the soil substrate, which was also confirmed by the calculated ED50 and ED90 values. A significant decrease of the root fresh mass was noted for all the treatments with MPEO in a range of 27%â€“91%, as compared to control. At the same time, a significant decrease of dry mass of roots was noted for the two highest doses of MPEO only, by 79% and 92%, as compared to control (
