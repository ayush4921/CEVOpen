  <title>Background and Purpose:</title>
  <p> The present study was conducted to investigate the inhibitory effects of 
   <italic>Carum carvi</italic> essential oil (EO) against 
   <italic>ERG6</italic> gene expression in relation to fungal growth and some important virulence factors in 
   <italic>Candida albicans</italic>.

  <title>Materials and Methods:</title>
  <p> The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 
   <italic>C. carvi</italic> EO against 
   <italic>C. albicans</italic> was determined by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute M27-A4 method at a concentration range of 20-1280 μg/ml. Furthermore, the expression of 
   <italic>ERG6</italic> gene was studied at the 0.5× MIC concentration of 
   <italic>C. carvi</italic> EO using real-time polymerase chain reaction. The proteinase and phospholipase activities, cell surface hydrophobicity (CSH), and cell membrane ergosterol (CME) content of 
   <italic>C. albicans</italic> were also assessed at the 0.5× MIC concentration of the plant EO using the approved methods. In addition, fluconazole (FLC) was used as a control antifungal drug.

  <title>Results:</title>
  <p> The results indicated that the MIC and minimum fungicidal concentration of 
   <italic>C. carvi</italic> EO for 
   <italic>C. albicans</italic> growth were 320 and 640 μg/ml, respectively. The expression of fungal 
   <italic>ERG6</italic> at an mRNA level and ergosterol content of yeast cells were significantly decreased by both 
   <italic>C. carvi</italic> EO (640 μg/ml) and FLC (2 μg/ml). The proteinase and phospholipase activities were also reduced in 
   <italic>C. carvi</italic> EO by 49.82% and 53.26%, respectively, while they were inhibited in FLC-treated cultures by 27.72% and 34.67%, respectively. Furthermore, the CSH was inhibited in EO- and FLC-treated cultures by 12.75% and 20.80%, respectively.

  <title>Conclusion:</title>
  <p> Our findings revealed that 
   <italic>C. carvi</italic> EO can be considered a potential natural compound in the development of an efficient antifungal agent against 
   <italic>C. albicans</italic>.
