<p>The production of proteinase and phospholipase was reduced in 
 <italic>C. carvi</italic> EO and fluconazole-treated culture (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cmm-6-30-g002.tif">2</xref>). The proteinase and phospholipase activities were reduced in 
 <italic>C. carvi</italic> EO by 49.82% and 53.26%, respectively, while they were inhibited in fluconazole-treated cultures by 27.72% and 34.67%, respectively (

 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05). The results revealed that 
 <italic>C. carvi</italic> EO was as effective as fluconazole in the reduction of both proteinase and phospholipase production.
