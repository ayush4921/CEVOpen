<p>The CME contents of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> in 
 <italic>C. carvi</italic> EO- and fluconazole-treated cultures were measured at 0.084 and 0.064 Âµg/g, respectively (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), indicating a significant difference between the treated and control groups (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05). The CME was inhibited at the rates of 25.74% and 43.36% in 
 <italic>C. carvi</italic> EO- and fluconazole-treated cultures, respectively. The results showed that fluconazole was more efficient than 
 <italic>C. carvi</italic> EO in reducing the ergosterol content of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>.
