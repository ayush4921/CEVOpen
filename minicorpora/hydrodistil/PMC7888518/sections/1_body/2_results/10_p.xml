<p>The expression of 
 <italic>ERG6</italic> gene, as a mediator for the biosynthesis of ergosterol, was studied by means of quantitative PCR using specific primers in 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>-treated with 0.5× MIC of 
 <italic>C. carvi</italic> EO (160 μg/ml) and fluconazole (2 μg/ml). The amplification products were also analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cmm-6-30-g003.tif">Figure 3</xref>). The relative gene expression of 
 <italic>ERG6</italic> was measured according to the [2
 <sup>−ΔΔCT</sup>] formula. The 
 <italic>ERG6</italic> gene expression in the 
 <italic>C. carvi</italic> EO- and fluconazole-treated samples was reduced by around 2 folds at the mRNA level which was significant in comparison with that in the non-treated control (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cmm-6-30-g004.tif">Figure 4</xref>; 
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05). Therefore, both plant EO and fluconazole similarly inhibited 
 <italic>ERG6</italic> expression. Therefore, there was no significant difference between the EO- and fluconazole-treated samples in terms of the inhibition of 
 <italic>ERG6</italic> expression (
 <italic>P</italic>&gt;0.05).
