0: The adherence of  C. albicans to host cells is an essential early step in fungal infection related to cell surface hydrophobicity (CSH) [  2 ,  5 ].
1: Candida albicans can also adhere to the surfaces of medical devices and form biofilms.
2: It is well documented that there is a positive association between the degree of virulence and the ability to form infection [  6 ].
3: The  ERG6 has been reported to be a putative structural gene for ergosterol biosynthesis and essential for the normal functioning of the fungal cell membrane [  7 ].
