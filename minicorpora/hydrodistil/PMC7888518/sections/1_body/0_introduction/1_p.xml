<p>The prevalence of infections related to
 <italic> Candida</italic> speciesÂ has increased over the past three decades, especially in patients with different conditions, such as those with an immunocompromised state and AIDS, tissue transplantation, antibiotic therapy, and malignancy diseases [ 
 <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> ]. 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> is a major pathogenic agent that profoundly invades various parts of the human body by promoting hyphal switching, surface recognition molecules, phenotypic switching, and extracellular hydrolytic enzyme production attributed as virulence factors [ 
 <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> , 
 <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> ]. Extracellular hydrolytic enzymes, such as phospholipases and secreted proteinases, facilitate adherence, tissue penetration, and host invasion [
