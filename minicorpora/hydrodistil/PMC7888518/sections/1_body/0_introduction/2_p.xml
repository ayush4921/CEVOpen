<p>The adherence of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> to host cells is an essential early step in fungal infection related to cell surface hydrophobicity (CSH) [

 <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> ]. 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> can also adhere to the surfaces of medical devices and form biofilms. It is well documented that there is a positive association between the degree of virulence and the ability to form infection [ 
 <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> ]. The 
 <italic>ERG6</italic> has been reported to be a putative structural gene for ergosterol biosynthesis and essential for the normal functioning of the fungal cell membrane [
