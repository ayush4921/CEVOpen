0: Antifungal susceptibility assay was conducted according to the guidelines of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards CLSI M27-A4 method [  22 ].
1: Briefly,  C. albicans was adjusted to a final concentration of 0.5-2.510 3 CFU/mL in RPMI-1640 (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), using 3-(N-morpholino) propanesulfonic acid medium and then added to a 96-well plate.
2: To prepare the stock solution,  C. carvi EO was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) to obtain a final concentration of 100 mg/ml.
3: Subsequently, two-fold serial dilutions of the EO were prepared in RPMI to obtain the final concentrations of 20-1280 g/ml.
