<p>The phospholipase production was determined by the zone of precipitation around the fungal colony according to Samaranayake et al. using a slightly modified method [ 
 <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> ]. The egg-yolk agar medium consisted of SDA (13 g; Merck, Germany), NaCl (11.7 g), CaCl2 (0.111 g), and 10% sterile egg yolk. Therefore, 10 µl of the yeast suspension (106 cells/ml) was inoculated on the egg-yolk medium with 
 <italic>C. carvi</italic> EO (160 μg/ml) and fluconazole (2 μg/ml). The precipitation zone around the fungal colony was measured after incubation at 35ºC for 72 h.
