<p>For fluconazole, the serial two-fold concentrations of 0.5-256 µg/ml were prepared from a stock solution of fluconazole (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) in methanol (Merck, Germany). The plates were incubated at 35°C for 24-48 h. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 
 <italic>C. carvi</italic> EO and fluconazole was defined as 100% inhibition of fungal growth in 96-well microplates by visual assay. For determining minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC), 50 µl of the contents of each well over MIC with no visual fungal growth was transferred to Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) plates and incubated for 72 h at 35°C. The MFC was defined as the minimum concentration of EO and fluconazole which caused no growth on SDA plates. All tests were conducted in triplicate in three separate experiments.
