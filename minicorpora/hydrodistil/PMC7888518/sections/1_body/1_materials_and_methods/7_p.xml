<p>The determination of proteinase activity was assessed according to Dabiri et al. [ 
 <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> ]. Briefly, 10 µl of a 18-hour yeast suspension (106 cells/ml) was inoculated on bovine serum albumin (1%) medium which contained dextrose (2%), MgSO4 (0.05%), KH2PO4 (0.1%), and agar (2%) with 0.5× MIC concentration of 
 <italic>C. carvi</italic> EO (160 μg/ml) and fluconazole (2 μg/ml). Petri dishes were incubated for 5 days at 35oC and fixed with trichloroacetic acid (TCA, 20%). The zone of the proteolysis around the yeast colonies was measured according to Price et al. [
