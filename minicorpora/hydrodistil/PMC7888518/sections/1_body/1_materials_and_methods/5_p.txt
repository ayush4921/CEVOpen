0: For fluconazole, the serial two-fold concentrations of 0.5-256 g/ml were prepared from a stock solution of fluconazole (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) in methanol (Merck, Germany).
1: The plates were incubated at 35C for 24-48 h. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of  C. carvi EO and fluconazole was defined as 100% inhibition of fungal growth in 96-well microplates by visual assay.
2: For determining minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC), 50 l of the contents of each well over MIC with no visual fungal growth was transferred to Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) plates and incubated for 72 h at 35C.
3: The MFC was defined as the minimum concentration of EO and fluconazole which caused no growth on SDA plates.
4: All tests were conducted in triplicate in three separate experiments.
