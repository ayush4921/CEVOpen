0: The suspension was transferred to glass tubes and incubated at 90C for 1 h in a water bath and cooled at room temperature.
1: Afterward, 1 mL distilled water and 3 mL n-heptane were added and vortexed vigorously for 3 min.
2: After 30 min, the heptane layer was transferred to clear glass tubes and stored at -20C for 24 h. Then, 1 mL of sterol aliquot was diluted 5 folds in 100% ethanol and scanned at 230-300 nm using an ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan).
3: The presence of ergosterol and late sterol intermediate 24(2*) DHE in the extracted sample resulted in a characteristic four-peak curve.
4: The ergosterol content was calculated as the percentage of the wet weight of the cell using the following calculation:
