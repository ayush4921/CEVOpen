0: The phospholipase production was determined by the zone of precipitation around the fungal colony according to Samaranayake et al.
1: using a slightly modified method [  24 ].
2: The egg-yolk agar medium consisted of SDA (13 g; Merck, Germany), NaCl (11.7 g), CaCl2 (0.111 g), and 10% sterile egg yolk.
3: Therefore, 10 l of the yeast suspension (106 cells/ml) was inoculated on the egg-yolk medium with  C. carvi EO (160 g/ml) and fluconazole (2 g/ml).
4: The precipitation zone around the fungal colony was measured after incubation at 35oC for 72 h.
