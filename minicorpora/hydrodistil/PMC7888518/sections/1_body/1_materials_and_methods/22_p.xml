<p>In order to evaluate the effect of 
 <italic>C. carvi</italic> EO on the expression of 
 <italic>ERG6</italic> in 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, total RNA was extracted from the treated fungal at the 0.5× MIC concentration of 
 <italic>C. carvi</italic> EO (160 μg/ml) and fluconazole (2 μg/ml) by the RNX-Plus kit (Sinacolon, Iran). In addition, RNA concentrations and purity were determined, and complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis was carried out using a kit (Fermentas, USA) following a study performed by Jahanshiri et al. [ 
 <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> ]. The primers used in this study included F: 5'GTGGTGTAGGTGGTCCTGGT 3' and R: 5' CAATGGCATAAACAGCATCG 3' (ERG), as well as F: 5' CCA GCT TTC TAC GTT TCC 3' and reverse: 5' CTG TAA CCA CGT TCA GAC 3' (ACT1) [ 
 <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> ]. To calibrate the real-time quantitative PCR system, the standard curve of the serial dilutions (10−1 to 10−4) of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> was drawn with cDNA as a template. Real-time PCR was carried out using the SYBR green master mix (Applied Biosystems) in a final volume of 20 µl reaction, including 10 µl master mix (2X), 1 µl primers (10 mM), 1 µl of total cDNA sample, and distilled water for each reaction. Each sample was normalized for the amount of the template to the level of 
 <italic>ẞ-actin</italic> as a reference gene. The experiments were repeated in triplicate for each sample. The PCR conditions consisted of an initial incubation at 95°C for 10 min, as well as 40 cycles of 15 sec at 95°C, 1 min at 60°C, and 15 sec at 72°C by the ABI PRISM 7500 thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems). To determine the level of 
 <italic>ERG6</italic> expression, the differences between the threshold cycle (CT) of the samples and calibrator was calculated using the following formula:
