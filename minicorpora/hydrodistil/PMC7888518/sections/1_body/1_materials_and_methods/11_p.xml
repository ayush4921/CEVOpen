<p>The effect of 
 <italic>C. carvi</italic> EO on 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> CSH was measured by the biphasic hydrocarbon-aqueous phase method [ 
 <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> ]. Briefly, 10 µl of yeast suspension (106 cells/ml) was inoculated onto Sabouraud dextrose broth medium with 
 <italic>C. carvi</italic> EO (160 μg/ml) and fluconazole (2 μg/ml) and incubated at 35°C for 48 h. Subsequently, 5 ml of cell suspension was added to sterile glass test tubes. In addition, a test and an untreated control were prepared from the suspending medium and used as blank. In the next stage, 1 ml of xylene was added to each test suspension.
