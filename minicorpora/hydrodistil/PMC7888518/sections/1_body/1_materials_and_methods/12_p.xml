<p>The test and controls were placed in a water bath at 35Â°C for 10 min to equilibrate and then vortexed for 30 sec and returned to the water bath for a further 30 min. The lower aqueous phase was carefully transferred to a clean test tube. The absorbance at 520 nm was measured after mixing for 5 sec to suspend any unwanted aggregates. The suspension without xylene was used as a negative control. The hydrophobicity was described as the percentage reduction in the optical density of the test suspension, compared to that of the control. The percentage of hydrophobicity was calculated as follows:</p>
