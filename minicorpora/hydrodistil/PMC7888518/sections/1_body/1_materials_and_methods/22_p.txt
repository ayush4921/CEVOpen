0: In order to evaluate the effect of  C. carvi EO on the expression of  ERG6 in  C. albicans, total RNA was extracted from the treated fungal at the 0.5 MIC concentration of  C. carvi EO (160 g/ml) and fluconazole (2 g/ml) by the RNX-Plus kit (Sinacolon, Iran).
1: In addition, RNA concentrations and purity were determined, and complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis was carried out using a kit (Fermentas, USA) following a study performed by Jahanshiri et al.
2: [  25 ].
3: The primers used in this study included F: 5'GTGGTGTAGGTGGTCCTGGT 3' and R: 5' CAATGGCATAAACAGCATCG 3' (ERG), as well as F: 5' CCA GCT TTC TAC GTT TCC 3' and reverse: 5' CTG TAA CCA CGT TCA GAC 3' (ACT1) [  26 ].
4: To calibrate the real-time quantitative PCR system, the standard curve of the serial dilutions (101 to 104) of  C. albicans was drawn with cDNA as a template.
5: Real-time PCR was carried out using the SYBR green master mix (Applied Biosystems) in a final volume of 20 l reaction, including 10 l master mix (2X), 1 l primers (10 mM), 1 l of total cDNA sample, and distilled water for each reaction.
6: Each sample was normalized for the amount of the template to the level of  -actin as a reference gene.
7: The experiments were repeated in triplicate for each sample.
8: The PCR conditions consisted of an initial incubation at 95C for 10 min, as well as 40 cycles of 15 sec at 95C, 1 min at 60C, and 15 sec at 72C by the ABI PRISM 7500 thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems).
9: To determine the level of  ERG6 expression, the differences between the threshold cycle (CT) of the samples and calibrator was calculated using the following formula:
