The strains were cultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar (Merck, Germany) for 48 h at 37°C. In addition, 
 <italic>C. carvi</italic> seeds were purchased from the market. Plant materials were steam distilled for 90 min in a full glass apparatus. The EO was also prepared by the hydrodistillation of sterilized seeds using a Clevenger-type apparatus over a period of 4 h. The yield of EO was about 0.25% and was kept at 4°C [
