0: The determination of proteinase activity was assessed according to Dabiri et al.
1: [  11 ].
2: Briefly, 10 l of a 18-hour yeast suspension (106 cells/ml) was inoculated on bovine serum albumin (1%) medium which contained dextrose (2%), MgSO4 (0.05%), KH2PO4 (0.1%), and agar (2%) with 0.5 MIC concentration of  C. carvi EO (160 g/ml) and fluconazole (2 g/ml).
3: Petri dishes were incubated for 5 days at 35oC and fixed with trichloroacetic acid (TCA, 20%).
4: The zone of the proteolysis around the yeast colonies was measured according to Price et al.
