0: The effect of  C. carvi EO on  C. albicans CSH was measured by the biphasic hydrocarbon-aqueous phase method [  11 ].
1: Briefly, 10 l of yeast suspension (106 cells/ml) was inoculated onto Sabouraud dextrose broth medium with  C. carvi EO (160 g/ml) and fluconazole (2 g/ml) and incubated at 35C for 48 h. Subsequently, 5 ml of cell suspension was added to sterile glass test tubes.
2: In addition, a test and an untreated control were prepared from the suspending medium and used as blank.
3: In the next stage, 1 ml of xylene was added to each test suspension.
