 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> (10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/ml) was inoculated onto Sabouraud dextrose broth medium with 
 <italic>C. carvi</italic> EO (160 μg/ml) and fluconazole (2 μg/ml) and then incubated at 35ºC for 72 h. The fungal cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 5 min, washed with distilled water, dried at room temperature, and weighed. In the next stage, 3 mL of 25% alcoholic potassium hydroxide was added to each pellet and vortexed for 1 min.
