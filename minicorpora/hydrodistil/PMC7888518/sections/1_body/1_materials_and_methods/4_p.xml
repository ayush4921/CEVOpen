<p>Antifungal susceptibility assay was conducted according to the guidelines of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards CLSI M27-A4 method [ 
 <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> ]. Briefly, 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> was adjusted to a final concentration of 0.5-2.5×10
 <sup>3</sup> CFU/mL in RPMI-1640 (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), using 3-(N-morpholino) propanesulfonic acid medium and then added to a 96-well plate. To prepare the stock solution, 
 <italic>C. carvi</italic> EO was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) to obtain a final concentration of 100 mg/ml. Subsequently, two-fold serial dilutions of the EO were prepared in RPMI to obtain the final concentrations of 20-1280 μg/ml.
