 <italic>Carum carvi</italic> EO contains rich oxygenated compounds, such as carvone and limonene, affecting the integrity of the fungal cell membrane. It has been shown that free-terpene hydrocarbons containing oxygenated compounds with low molecular weights are able to penetrate through the cell membrane after combining with lipophilic molecules [ 
 <xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> ]. Furthermore, phenolic compounds with OH group and aromatic structure have been identified to contribute to the deactivation of fungal enzymes [ 
 <xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> ]. Our findings revealed that 
 <italic>C. carvi</italic> EO could successfully inhibit extracellular proteinase and phospholipase activities in 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Moreover, based on the evidence, proteinase and phospholipase activities are also involved in adhesion and tissue invasion by 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> [ 
 <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> , 
 <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> ]. The reduction of proteinase and phospholipase activities may be regarded as a consequence of targeting the active sites of these enzymes by 
 <italic>C. carvi</italic> EO.
