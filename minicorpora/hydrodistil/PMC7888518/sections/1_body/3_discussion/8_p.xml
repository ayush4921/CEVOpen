<p>Ergosterol is one of the main parts of the fungal cell membrane and is reported to be the main target for antifungal drugs. Ergosterol biosynthesis is mediated by ERG gene family among which 
 <italic>ERG6</italic> is an important gene. This gene encodes C-24 methyltransferase, which converts zymosterol to fecosterol in the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway. The 
 <italic>ERG6</italic> gene is required for the normal function of the cell membrane in 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>; therefore, the mutation of this gene can inhibit the antifungal activities of drugs [ 
 <xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> ]. In the current study, CME content was reduced to 25.74% at a 0.5× MIC concentration of 
 <italic>C. carvi</italic> EO (160 μg/ml). In addition, the expression of 
 <italic>ERG6</italic> was decreased around 2 folds at the mRNA level at the same concentration.
