<p>The present study was aimed to investigate the inhibitory effects of 
 <italic>C. carvi</italic> EO against some virulence factors, such as the production of proteinase and phospholipase, CSH, cell membrane ergosterol content, and expression of 
 <italic>ERG6</italic> gene as a mediator for the biosynthesis of ergosterol in 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>. The EOs are complex natural mixtures composed of numerous constituents at quite different concentrations. Therefore, it is difficult to attribute the antifungal activity to a specific component of this product.
