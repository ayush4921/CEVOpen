<p>Our results showed that 
 <italic>C. carvi</italic> EO at a concentration of 320 μg/ml declined the growth rate of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> by 50%. However, at the concentration of 640 μg/ml, this product completely inhibited fungal growth. With respect to the MIC values of fluconazole (4 μg/ml), it had a potency that was 80 times more than that of 
 <italic>C. carvi</italic> EO, which is usual due to the fact that we compared the MIC of a pure antifungal agent with the MIC of a mixed unpurified plant EO. This means that a comparison will be more accurate if the MIC of fluconazole is compared with the MIC of the inhibitory bioactive component of 
 <italic>C. carvi</italic> EO.
