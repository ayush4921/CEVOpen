<p>The antifungal activity of 
 <italic>C. carvi</italic> EO was studied against a wide variety of fungi [

 <xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> - 
 <xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> ]. 
 <italic>Carum carvi</italic> EO was found to possess remarkable antifungal activity against
 <italic> Candida krusei</italic> ATCC 6258,
 <italic> Candida parapsilosis</italic> ATCC 22019, 
 <italic>Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus,</italic> and 
 <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic>, as well as an effective inhibition against 
 <italic>C. krusei</italic> growth (42-mm inhibition zone) [ 
 <xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> ]. 
 <italic>Carum carvi</italic> reportedly acts as an inhibitor of aflatoxin production in A. parasiticus. However, it showed no effect on fungal growth even at the highest concentration (1000 Î¼g/ml) [
