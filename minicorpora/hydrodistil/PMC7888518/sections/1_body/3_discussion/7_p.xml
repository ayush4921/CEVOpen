<p>Patel et al. observed that a crude extract of Dodonaea viscosa was not able to inhibit proteinase and phospholipase activities in 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>. However, the presence of phytosterol and tannins in the extract may have caused extensive cellular damage, including cell wall damage [
