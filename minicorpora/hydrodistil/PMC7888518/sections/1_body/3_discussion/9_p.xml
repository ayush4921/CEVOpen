<p>Since the absence of a functional sterol methyltransferase could induce cell hypersensitivity to exogenous compounds, the inhibition of 
 <italic>ERG6</italic> gene expression may increase the potency of new or existing antifungals. Therefore, the natural inhibitors of 
 <italic>ERG6</italic> gene product, such as 
 <italic>C. carvi</italic> EO, introduced in the present study allows for the clinical treatment of candidiasis in a safer manner at a lower dosage [ 
 <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> ]. On the other hand, it has been shown that 
 <italic>C. carvi</italic> EO suppresses the expression of cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) at the transcription level [ 
 <xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> ], which is responsible for the hepatotoxic effects of azole antifungal agents [
