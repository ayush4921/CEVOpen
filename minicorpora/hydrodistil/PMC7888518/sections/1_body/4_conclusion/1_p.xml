<p>As the findings indicated, 
 <italic>C. carvi</italic> EO could suppress 
 <italic>ERG6</italic> gene as a crucial gene in ergosterol biosynthesis in 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> and efficiently inhibit the major virulence factors of the fungus, including exoenzymes, cell membrane hydrophobicity, and CME content. The main antifungal components of 
 <italic>C. carvi</italic> EO may be useful as natural alternatives for antifungal drug formulations to manage fungal infections caused by 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>.
