    "<h4>Background and purpose</h4>The present study was conducted to investigate the inhibitory effects of <i>Carum carvi</i> essential oil (EO) against <i>ERG6</i> gene expression in relation to fungal growth and some important virulence factors in <i>Candida albicans</i>.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of <i>C. carvi</i> EO against <i>C. albicans</i> was determined by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute M27-A4 method at a concentration range of 20-1280 μg/ml. Furthermore, the expression of <i>ERG6</i> gene was studied at the 0.5× MIC concentration of <i>C. carvi</i> EO using real-time polymerase chain reaction. The proteinase and phospholipase activities, cell surface hydrophobicity (CSH), and cell membrane ergosterol (CME) content of <i>C. albicans</i> were also assessed at the 0.5× MIC concentration of the plant EO using the approved methods. In addition, fluconazole (FLC) was used as a control antifungal drug.<h4>Results</h4>The results indicated that the MIC and minimum fungicidal concentration of <i>C. carvi</i> EO for <i>C. albicans</i> growth were 320 and 640 μg/ml, respectively. The expression of fungal <i>ERG6</i> at an mRNA level and ergosterol content of yeast cells were significantly decreased by both <i>C. carvi</i> EO (640 μg/ml) and FLC (2 μg/ml). The proteinase and phospholipase activities were also reduced in <i>C. carvi</i> EO by 49.82% and 53.26%, respectively, while they were inhibited in FLC-treated cultures by 27.72% and 34.67%, respectively. Furthermore, the CSH was inhibited in EO- and FLC-treated cultures by 12.75% and 20.80%, respectively.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our findings revealed that <i>C. carvi</i> EO can be considered a potential natural compound in the development of an efficient antifungal agent against <i>C. albicans</i>."
