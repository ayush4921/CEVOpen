 <caption> Cytotoxicity of 11-keto-α-boswellic acid (α-KBA) and acetyl-11-keto-α-boswellic acid (α-AKBA) against the human triple-negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 in vitro. ( a) Comparison of the cytotoxic efficacies of α-KBA against MDA-MB-231 cells and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Cancer cells were more sensitive to α-KBA than non-cancerogenic PBMC. ( b) The acetylated form, α-AKBA, exhibits higher cytotoxicity compared to α-KBA. XTT (2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide salt) assay, 72 h incubation, n = 3 (all biological replicates were performed in triplicates). Student´s t-test, * p &lt; 0.05. </caption>
