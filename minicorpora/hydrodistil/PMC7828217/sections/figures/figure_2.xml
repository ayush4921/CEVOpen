  <p>Chemical structures of boswellic acids. (
   <bold>a</bold>) α-Boswellic acids are based on the oleanane structure: α-boswellic acid (α-BA), acetyl-α-boswellic acid (α-ABA), 11-keto-α-boswellic acid (α-KBA), and acetyl-11-keto-α-boswellic acid (α-AKBA). (
   <bold>b</bold>) In contrast, β-boswellic acids are derived from the ursane structure: β-boswellic acid (β-BA), acetyl-β-boswellic acid (β-ABA), 11-keto-β-boswellic acid (β-KBA), and acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (β-AKBA). Corresponding boswellic acids are constitutional isomers, only differing by the position of two methyl groups at ring E. For α-boswellic acids, the methyl groups at ring E are arranged in geminal position, whereas β-boswellic acids have vicinal methyl groups.
