 <caption> Visualization of variations in composition of 11-keto-boswellic acids (KBAs) and acetyl-11-keto-boswellic acids (AKBAs) in oleogum resins of different Boswellia species. B. sacra (red), B. serrata (blue), B. dalzielli (violet), B. papyrifera (pink), B. carterii (green), B. neglecta (yellow), B. frereana (black), B. rivae (grey), and B. occulta (dark red). ( a) Semi-logarithmic scatter plot of total KBA contents and ratio between 11-keto-α-boswellic acid (α-KBA) and 11-keto-β-boswellic acid (β-KBA). ( b) Semi-logarithmic scatter plot of total AKBA contents and ratio between acetyl-11-keto-α-boswellic acid (α-AKBA) and acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (β-AKBA). Contents &lt; LOQ were considered as 0.000 µg/mg and as constitutional isomers ratio of 50/50. ( c) Biplot of principal component analysis (PCA) with loadings of α-KBA, β-KBA, α-AKBA, and β-AKBA (dashed lines), and individual scores of samples (dots). </caption>
