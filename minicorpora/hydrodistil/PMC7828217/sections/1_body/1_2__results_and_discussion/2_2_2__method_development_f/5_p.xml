<p>The optimization of the chromatographic parameters by CCD experimental design allowed an investigation of three independent variables (factors) at five levels with only

 <sup>3</sup> + 2 x 3 + 1 = 15 experiments, while a full-factorial design with three variables would require

 <sup>3</sup> = 125 experiments [
