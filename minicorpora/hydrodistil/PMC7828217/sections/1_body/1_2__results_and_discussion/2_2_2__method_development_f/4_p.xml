<p>Evaluation of the effects demonstrated that only variables A and B had a significant effect on the chromatographic resolution of α-KBA/β-KBA and α-AKBA/β-AKBA. The experimental design has shown that the level conditions of experiments 5 and 11 enabled a successful chromatographic separation of α-KBA and β-KBA (
