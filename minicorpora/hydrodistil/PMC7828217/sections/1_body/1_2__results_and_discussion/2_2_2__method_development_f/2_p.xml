 <xref rid="B18-molecules-26-00366" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. To achieve sufficient separation efficiency, the chromatographic parameters were optimized by means of Design of Experiments (DoE). As experimental design, a three-factorial central composite design (CCD) was used, with the starting concentration of eluent B as variable A, the slope of the gradient as variable B, and the flow rate as variable C. Hence, the experimental design was composed of a full two-level factorial design (
