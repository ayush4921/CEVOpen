0: The optimization of the chromatographic parameters by CCD experimental design allowed an investigation of three independent variables (factors) at five levels with only  N = 2 3 + 2 x 3 + 1 = 15 experiments, while a full-factorial design with three variables would require  N = 5 3 = 125 experiments [ 29].
1: Furthermore, the PFP stationary phase provided enhanced dipoledipole interactions,  interactions, chargetransfer interactions, and ionexchange interactions compared to C18 or C8 phases [ 30, 31].
2: Hence, the developed novel analytical method, based on experiment 5, enabled a selective quantification of -KBA, -KBA, -AKBA, and -AKBA for the first time ( Figure 5b).
