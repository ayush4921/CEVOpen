0: The chromatographic resolution,  R, between the individual constitutional isomers served as dependent response variables.
1: R was calculated with the following formula: (1)R=1.18 tR(Peak 2) tR(Peak 1)w0.5(Peak 2) + w0.5(Peak 1)  where t R is the respective retention time and w 0,5 is the respective peak width at half-height.
2: Whereby, two peaks with a resolution  R  1.5 were considered as sufficiently separated for individual quantification [ 28].
3: To enable a sensitive and accurate detection of the analytes, tandem mass spectrometry in multiple reaction monitoring mode (MRM) was used.
