<p>For selective and simultaneous quantification of the constitutional isomers of 11-keto-boswellic acids (KBAs), i.e., 11-keto-α-boswellic acid (α-KBA) and 11-keto-β-boswellic acid (β-KBA), as well as acetyl-11-keto-boswellic acids (AKBAs), i.e., acetyl-11-keto-α-boswellic acid (α-AKBA) and acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (β-AKBA), a novel chromatographic separation method was developed.</p>
