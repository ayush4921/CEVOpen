0: Evaluation of the effects demonstrated that only variables A and B had a significant effect on the chromatographic resolution of -KBA/-KBA and -AKBA/-AKBA.
1: The experimental design has shown that the level conditions of experiments 5 and 11 enabled a successful chromatographic separation of -KBA and -KBA ( Figure 4b).
2: However, under the conditions of experiment 11, no sufficient elution of -AKBA and -AKBA from the column was possible ( Figure 4c).
