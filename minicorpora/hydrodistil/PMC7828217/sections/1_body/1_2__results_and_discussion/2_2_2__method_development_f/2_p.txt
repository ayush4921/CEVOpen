0: Since the chromatographic separation of the constitutional isomers of KBAs and AKBAs with the help of C18 phases was insufficient [ 4, 5, 16, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27], other stationary phases with varying selectivities were investigated.
1: Here, on the basis of our previous study, a fluorinated stationary phase with pentafluorophenyl (PFP) moieties was used [ 18].
2: To achieve sufficient separation efficiency, the chromatographic parameters were optimized by means of Design of Experiments (DoE).
3: As experimental design, a three-factorial central composite design (CCD) was used, with the starting concentration of eluent B as variable A, the slope of the gradient as variable B, and the flow rate as variable C. Hence, the experimental design was composed of a full two-level factorial design ( Figure 4a: green dots and  Table 2: Experiments 18), axial points ( Figure 4a: blue dots and  Table 2: Experiments 914), and a center point ( Figure 4a: red dot and  Table 2: Experiment 15).
