<p>The European pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.) recommends the characterization of extracts from 
 <italic>B. serrata</italic> by their β-KBA and β-AKBA contents [
 <xref rid="B59-molecules-26-00366" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. However, the recommended HPLC method using a C18 column is unable to distinguish the corresponding α- and β-isomers. Furthermore, compared to other boswellic acids, KBAs and particularly AKBAs contents correlated only weakly with cytokine release inhibition and cytotoxicity against MDA-MB-231 cells [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-26-00366" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Considering that acetyl-β-boswellic acid (β-ABA) exhibited the highest correlation with cytokine inhibition, the highest cytotoxicity against cancer cells, besides being clearly quantifiable [
