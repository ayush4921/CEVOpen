<p>The antitumor activity of Î±-KBA was further verified in vivo, by means of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer xenografts grown on the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of fertilized chick eggs. Moreover, the influence of acetylation on cytotoxicity in vivo was analyzed. After treatment for 3 consecutive days with the individual compounds at different doses, the tumor volumes were measured and specimens were analyzed immunohistochemically regarding proliferation and apoptosis by Ki-67 antigen staining and the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) method, respectively (
