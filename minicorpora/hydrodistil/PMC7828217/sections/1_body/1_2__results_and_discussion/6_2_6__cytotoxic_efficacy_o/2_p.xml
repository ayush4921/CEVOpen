<p>Further, the cytotoxic efficacy of α-KBA was investigated on two additional TNBC cell lines, CAL-51 and CAL-148. Likewise, α-KBA exhibited considerable cytotoxicity against CAL-51 cells (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 34.6 ± 1.9 µM) and CAL-148 cells (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 36.1 ± 1.9 µM), indicating cytotoxic efficacy against different treatment-resistant TNBC cells.
