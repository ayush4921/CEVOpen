<p>Treatment of breast cancer xenografts with 50 µM α-KBA significantly reduced the tumor volume and cancer cell proliferation, and induced apoptosis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00366-f008">Figure 8</xref>b–d). However, treatment with 10 µM α-KBA showed no statistically significant effects on breast cancer xenografts. In contrast to α-KBA, α-AKBA inhibited the proliferation of breast cancer cells already at 10 µM treatment. Whereas, the treatment with 50 µM α-AKBA resulted in total absence of tumors. Thus, the in vivo results confirmed that acetylated keto-boswellic acids are more potent against TBNC cells than their deacetylated forms. This corresponds with previously published data showing a high correlation between contents of acetylated boswellic acids in

 <xref rid="B27-molecules-26-00366" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Moreover, it was demonstrated that acetylated boswellic acids inhibit the activity of human topoisomerases by direct interaction, similar to anticancer drugs such as camptothecin and etoposide [

 <xref rid="B12-molecules-26-00366" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Notably, no death or obvious malformation of chick embryos were observed, which points to low systemic toxicity of α-KBA and α-AKBA.
