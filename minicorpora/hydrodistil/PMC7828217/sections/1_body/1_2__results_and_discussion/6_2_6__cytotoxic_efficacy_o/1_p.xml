<p>Investigation of cytotoxic efficacy revealed that α-KBA concentration-dependently inhibited the viability of the highly metastatic, treatment-resistant, triple-negative human breast cancer (TNBC) cell line MDA-MB-231 in vitro with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) of 42.0 ± 4.6 µM (

 <xref rid="B12-molecules-26-00366" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Hence, the effect of α-KBA on the viability of TBNC cells was compared to that of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Interestingly, cancer cells were statistically significantly (Student´s 
 <italic>t</italic>-test, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.031) more sensitive to α-KBA compared to human PBMC, the non-cancerogenic control group (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 75.2 ± 9.0 µM). However, comparing the cytotoxicity of KBA α- and β-isomers, β-KBA is more effective against MDA-MB-231 cells (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00366-f007">Figure 7</xref>b). In fact, the acetylated β-isomer, β-AKBA, was the most effective one, indicating that β-configuration and acetylation increase the cytotoxic efficacy against TNBC cells. Comparing cytotoxicity against MDA-MB-231 and calculated ALogP values showed increasing efficacy with increasing lipophilicity. This phenomenon can be explained by cellular permeability, which is increased with increased lipophilicity [
