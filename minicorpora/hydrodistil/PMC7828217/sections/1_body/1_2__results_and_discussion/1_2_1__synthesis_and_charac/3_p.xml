<p>Using one- and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, the structure of α-KBA was elucidated (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00366-f003">Figure 3</xref>a and 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-00366">Supplementary Figures S3–S8</xref>). The 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum of α-KBA showed seven singlet signals (CH
 <sub>3</sub>-23, CH
 <sub>3</sub>-25, CH
 <sub>3</sub>-26, CH
 <sub>3</sub>-27, CH
 <sub>3</sub>-28 CH
 <sub>3</sub>-29, and CH
 <sub>3</sub>-30) accounting for methyl groups attached to quaternary carbons (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00366-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Characteristic for α-boswellic acids, which are derived from oleanane, are two germinal methyl groups at C-20 [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-26-00366" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In α-KBA, these two geminal methyl groups appeared at δ
 <sub>H</sub> 0.88 (CH
 <sub>3</sub>-29) and δ
 <sub>H</sub> 0.89 (CH
 <sub>3</sub>-30). The presence of a keto function at C-11 (δ
 <sub>C</sub> 198.9) was confirmed by long-range heteronuclear correlations with two methine signals, namely the adjacent angular H-9 (δ
 <sub>H</sub> 2.35) and the olefinic H-12 (δ
 <sub>H</sub> 5.47), which represents the most downfield signal in the 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum. The remaining signals were assigned by homo- and hetero-nuclear correlated NMR spectroscopy, 
 <sup>1</sup>H, 
 <sup>1</sup>H COSY (correlated spectroscopy), 
 <sup>1</sup>H, 
 <sup>13</sup>C HSQC (heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectroscopy), and 
 <sup>1</sup>H, 
 <sup>13</sup>C HMBC (heteronuclear multiple bond correlation). The stereochemistry was elucidated based on correlations in the 
 <sup>1</sup>H, 
 <sup>1</sup>H ROESY (rotating frame Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy) spectrum (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00366-f003">Figure 3</xref>b). Spectral overlaps could be clarified using 
 <sup>1</sup>H, 
 <sup>1</sup>H SELTOCSY (selective total correlation spectroscopy), which served as projections for two-dimensional (2D) spectra.
