<p>To develop an analytical method for selective quantification of individual keto-boswellic acids in 
 <italic>Boswellia</italic> oleogum resins, initially, 11-keto-α-boswellic acid (α-KBA, syn. (3α,4β)-3-hydroxy-11-oxo-olean-12-en-24-oic acid) was synthesized and characterized. Starting from acetyl-α-boswellic acid (α-ABA), firstly, acetyl-11-keto-α-boswellic acid (α-AKBA) was synthesized by radical-type reaction with bromine and characterized as previously described [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-26-00366" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Afterwards, α-KBA was synthesized by saponification of α-AKBA, with subsequent purification by semi-preparative reversed-phase HPLC.
