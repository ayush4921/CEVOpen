<p>Analyses of KBAs contents revealed that four of five 
 <italic>B. carterii</italic> samples contained a very low total KBA content (0.08–0.87 µg/mg) with a relatively high proportion of α-KBA (20.3–25.5%) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00366-f006">Figure 6</xref>a). Likewise, the total AKBA content of these samples was very low (0.001–0.1 µg/mg), whereas the α-AKBA proportion (9.7–14.8%) was enhanced (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00366-f006">Figure 6</xref>b). However, one 
 <italic>B. carterii</italic> sample exhibited higher total KBAs and AKBAs contents with a lower proportion of the α-isomers but was still distinguishable from 
 <italic>B. sacra</italic> samples (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00366-f006">Figure 6</xref>c). Moreover, GC analysis of the essential oil of 
 <italic>B. carterii</italic> revealed a lower content of α-pinene, but higher contents of inter alia limonene, α-thujene, 
 <italic>para</italic>-cymene, and α-phellandrene compared to 
 <italic>B. sacra</italic> (

 <italic>B. carterii</italic> and 
 <italic>B. sacra</italic>, yielded the same results and revealed additionally major differences in enantiomeric ration of α-pinene [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-26-00366" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Furthermore, a comparative analysis of the boswellic and lupeolic acid compositions showed clear differences, too, between 
 <italic>B. carterii</italic> and 
 <italic>B. sacra</italic> samples [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-26-00366" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In conclusion, the analyzed 
 <italic>B. carterii</italic> and 
 <italic>B. sacra</italic> samples were clearly distinguishable, suggesting that they are two different species. Genotyping could provide further evidence.
