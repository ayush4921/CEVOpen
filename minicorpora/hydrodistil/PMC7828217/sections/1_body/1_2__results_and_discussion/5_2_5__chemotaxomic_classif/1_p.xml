<p>As the distribution areas of the more than 25 known 
 <italic>Boswellia</italic> species overlap and taxonomic specifications are rarely clearly defined, the botanic assignment of individual specimen has always been hampered [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-26-00366" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This is particularly true for the biodiversity hotspot located at the Horn of Africa, where most 
 <italic>Boswellia</italic> species flourish [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-26-00366" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-26-00366" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Furthermore, an on-site classification is often difficult, because the habitat regions are mostly located in less developed and geopolitically unstable countries, e.g., Somalia or Yemen. Hence, a chemotaxonomic classification on the basis of phytochemicals such as boswellic acids could represent an interesting alternative. Hereinafter, the contents of KBAs and AKBAs, the essential oilÂ´s compositions, as well as further data will be discussed as typical for individual 
 <italic>Boswellia</italic> species.
