 <italic>B. neglecta</italic> olegum resins from Somalia were very similar to 
 <italic>B. carterii</italic> with low total contents of KBAs (0.2–1.7 µg/mg) and AKBAs (0.03–0.14 µg/mg) and high proportions of the respective α-isomers, α-KBA (18.5–32.9%) and α-AKBA (15.9–18.4%). Considering the similar contents of further boswellic and lupeolic acids, the differentiation between 
 <italic>B. neglecta</italic> and 
 <italic>B. carterii</italic> species is hampered. Only the high contents of acetyl-lupeolic acid, acetyl-α-boswellic acid, and acetyl-β-boswellic acid in some 
 <italic>B. carterii</italic> gum resins might serve as a reference point for differentiation [
