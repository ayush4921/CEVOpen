<p>Differently, oleogum resins of 
 <italic>B. neglecta</italic> from Kenya as well as 
 <italic>B. rivae</italic> are characterized by very low total contents of KBAs (&lt;LOQ 0.06 µg/mg) and AKBAs (0.002–0.055 µg/mg). Remarkably, 
 <italic>B. rivae</italic> is the only sample that exhibited a higher proportion of the α-isomer α-KBA with 57.7%, which makes it unique. Further investigations of 
 <italic>B. neglecta</italic> (from Kenya) and 
 <italic>B. rivae</italic> revealed very low contents of all boswellic and lupeolic acids [

 <italic>Commiphora</italic>, such as the rather unknown species 
 <italic>Commiphora confusa</italic> [

 <xref rid="B54-molecules-26-00366" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Analysis of 
 <italic>Commiphora</italic> specific compounds, e.g., 
 <italic>E</italic>- and 
 <italic>Z</italic>-guggulsterone, could provide further information on that.
