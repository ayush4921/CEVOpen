<p>Likewise, total contents of KBAs and AKBAs as well as the individual isomer proportion in 
 <italic>B. occulta</italic> were indistinguishable from those of 
 <italic>B. sacra</italic> (

 <italic>B. occulta</italic> and 
 <italic>B. sacra</italic> are very similar [

 <italic>B. occulta</italic> revealed an outstandingly high amount of methyl esters, especially 1-methoxydecane, which was identified so far as a major constituent only for this species [
