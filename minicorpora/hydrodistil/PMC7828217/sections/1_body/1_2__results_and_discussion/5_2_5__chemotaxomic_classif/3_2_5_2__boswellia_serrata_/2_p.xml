<p>The total KBA contents of 
 <italic>B. serrata</italic> differed from those of 
 <italic>B. sacra</italic> with higher values of 3.0–22.9 µg/mg. The proportion of α-KBA was low. In contrast to 
 <italic>B. sacra</italic>, 
 <italic>B. serrata</italic> contained lower total AKBA contents (8.0–18.7 µg/mg). Thus, this confirms previous results showing that the composition of oleogum resins from 
 <italic>B. serrata</italic> differ from that of 
 <italic>B. sacra</italic> due to a high percentage of deacetylated boswellic acids [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-26-00366" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-26-00366" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This dissimilarity becomes especially apparent by the different score positions within the biplot of the principal component analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00366-f006">Figure 6</xref>c). The unique boswellic acid composition in combination with the occurrence of methylchavicol is characteristic for 
 <italic>B. serrata</italic> oleogum resins.
