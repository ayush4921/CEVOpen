<p>At first glance, oleogum resins of 
 <italic>B. papyrifera</italic> resemble those of 
 <italic>B. sacra</italic> with regard to the contents of acetylated boswellic acids [

 <italic>B. dalzielli</italic> is unique (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00366-f006">Figure 6</xref>c). The total AKBAs content (53.4–72.2 µg/mg) is significantly higher compared to all other species (

 <italic>B. sacra</italic>. Furthermore, the total KBAs content (9.8–13.8 µg/mg) is higher than in most other 
 <italic>Boswellia</italic> species.
