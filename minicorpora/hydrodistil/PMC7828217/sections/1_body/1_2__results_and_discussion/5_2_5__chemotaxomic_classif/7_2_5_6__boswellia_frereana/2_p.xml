 <italic>B. frereana</italic> is the only 
 <italic>Boswellia</italic> species that contains no boswellic or lupeolic acids [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-26-00366" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-26-00366" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Accordingly, the contents of KBAs and AKBAs were below the LOQ and LOD in this study, too. This fact makes 
 <italic>B. frereana</italic> unique and clearly distinguishable from all other 
 <italic>Boswellia</italic> species. Interestingly, 
 <italic>B. frereana</italic> contains high amounts of lupeol and epi-lupeol [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-26-00366" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], which are precursors for boswellic acid biosynthesis [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-26-00366" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Hence, a possible explanation for the lack of boswellic acids might be a missing gene of the oxidoreductase necessary for formation of the carboxyl functional group.
