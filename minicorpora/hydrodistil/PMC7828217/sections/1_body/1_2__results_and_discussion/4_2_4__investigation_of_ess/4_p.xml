<p>Interestingly, all essential oil samples contained the monoterpene 5,5-dimethyl-1-vinylbicyclo[2.1.1]hexane (hashishene). Hashishene is formed by photo-oxidation of myrcene and was given its common name from hashish, resins of 
 <italic>Cannabis sativa</italic> [

 <italic>Boswellia</italic> resins. Particularly, the essential oil from 
 <italic>B. serrata</italic> investigated in this study exhibits the highest amount of myrcene and as a result, the highest amount of hashishene.
