<p>HPLC-MS/MS analysis exhibited contents of KBAs below LOQ in all essential oil samples. Likewise, the contents of AKBAs in essential oils of 
 <italic>B. sacra</italic>, 
 <italic>B. serrata</italic>, 
 <italic>B. carterii</italic>, 
 <italic>B. frereana</italic>, and 
 <italic>B. dalzielli</italic> were below LOQ. Only in essential oils of 
 <italic>B. papyrifera</italic>, 
 <italic>B. neglecta</italic>, and 
 <italic>B. rivae</italic> could very low concentrations of 2â€“3 ng/mg AKBAs be found. Given the high molecular weight of boswellic acids, these results are to be expected. Hence, triterpenes are not recognized to be usual constituents of distilled essential oils.
