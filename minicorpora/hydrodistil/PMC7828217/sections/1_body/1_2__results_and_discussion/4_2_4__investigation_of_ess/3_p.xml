<p>Gas chromatographic (GC) analysis showed that essential oils consist mainly of the monoterpenoids α-thujene, α-pinene, β-pinene, sabinene, 
 <italic>para</italic>-cymene, and limonene (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00366-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). This generally complies with previously published data, where different 
 <italic>Boswellia</italic> essential oils were investigated [

 <xref rid="B33-molecules-26-00366" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Thus, our data illustrate that essential oils from 
 <italic>B. sacra</italic> and 
 <italic>B. carterii</italic> are chemically distinct, with α-pinene being more dominant in the former species [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-26-00366" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], despite the fact that 
 <italic>B. carterii</italic> is often considered a synonym of 
 <italic>B. sacra</italic> (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot5dot5-molecules-26-00366">Section 2.5.5</xref>). In contrast to all other samples, the main component of 
 <italic>B. serrata</italic> essential oil was myrcene, with 41.4%. Such a high content of myrcene in 
 <italic>B. serrata</italic> is quite unusual, since the main monoterpene of 
 <italic>B. serrata</italic> essential oil is frequently α-thujene [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-26-00366" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], but high myrcene contents have been already observed in other studies [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-26-00366" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-26-00366" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Notably, high amounts of myrcene might not be harmless because the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified it in 2017 as a potential carcinogen [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-26-00366" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-26-00366" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. However, this classification is currently under discussion [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-26-00366" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Furthermore, essential oil from 
 <italic>B. serrata</italic> contained 6.0% methylchavicol (estragole), which is under suspicion as a genotoxic compound [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-26-00366" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-26-00366" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].
