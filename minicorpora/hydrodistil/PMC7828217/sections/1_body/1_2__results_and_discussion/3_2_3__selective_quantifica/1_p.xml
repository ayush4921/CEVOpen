<p>By means of the novel developed HPLC-MS/MS method, the contents of 11-keto-α-boswellic acid (α-KBA), 11-keto-β-boswellic acid (β-KBA), acetyl-11-keto-α-boswellic acid (α-AKBA), and acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (β-AKBA) were quantified in 41 oleogum resins of nine different 
 <italic>Boswellia</italic> species. To begin with, the analytical method was validated in terms of linearity, precision, accuracy, recovery, limit of detection (LOD), and limit of quantification (LOQ) (see
