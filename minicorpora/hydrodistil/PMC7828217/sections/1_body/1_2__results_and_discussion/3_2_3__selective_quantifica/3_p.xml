<p>The analyses of 41 
 <italic>Boswellia</italic> samples showed that with 1.1–7.8%, α-KBA makes only a small proportion of the total KBAs in oleogum resins of 
 <italic>B. sacra</italic>, 
 <italic>B. dalzielli</italic>, 
 <italic>B. papyrifera</italic>, 
 <italic>B. serrata</italic>, or 
 <italic>B. occulta</italic> (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00366-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Similarly, α-AKBA makes only 0.5–6.4% of the total AKBAs in those species. In contrast, in oleogum resins of 
 <italic>B. carterii</italic> and 
 <italic>B. neglecta</italic>, the proportion of α-KBA was much higher, reaching 25.5% and 32.9%, respectively. Likewise, the proportions of α-AKBA were increased with maximum amounts of 14.8% in 
 <italic>B. carterii</italic> and 18.4% in 
 <italic>B. neglecta</italic>. Remarkably, the oleogum resin of 
 <italic>B. rivae</italic> was the only sample that exhibited a higher proportion of α-KBA (57.7%) than β-KBA. In oleogum resins of the species 
 <italic>B. frereana</italic>, no KBAs and AKBAs could be detected. This corresponds to previous studies, which showed the lack of boswellic acids in this species [

 <italic>B. neglecta</italic> from Kenya, the contents of KBAs were below the LOQ, too.
