0: Boswellic acids exist in two different structural types: -boswellic acids, based on the oleanane structure, and -boswellic acids, derived from the ursane structure ( Figure 2) [ 14].
1: Hence, the corresponding boswellic acids represent constitutional isomers.
2: It was assumed that the pharmacologically interesting keto-boswellic acids, 11-keto--boswellic acid (-KBA, or commonly abbreviated as KBA) and acetyl-11-keto--boswellic acid (-AKBA, commonly abbreviated as AKBA), only occur as -isomers [ 3, 7, 15, 16].
3: However, in 2005, 70 years after the discovery of the first boswellic acids, we could demonstrate that in addition to -AKBA, the -isomer acetyl-11-keto--boswellic acid (-AKBA) naturally occurs in  Boswellia oleogum resins [ 17, 18].
4: As a result, it was hypothesized that also the deacetylated form, 11-keto--boswellic acid (-KBA), might exist, because biosynthesis of -AKBA takes place by acetylation of the precursor -KBA [ 6].
5: In this study, we demonstrate for the first time the existence and the natural occurrence of -KBA by using a novel, highly selective high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry HPLC-MS/MS method with a pentafluorophenyl (PFP) stationary phase.
