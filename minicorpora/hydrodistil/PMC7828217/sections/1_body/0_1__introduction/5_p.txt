0: The botanic and taxonomic assignment of a single  Boswellia specimen is often hampered by overlapping growth regions, but also by geopolitically unstable conditions within the producing countries [ 1, 2, 19].
1: Besides an outstanding genotyping, a chemotaxonomical classification on the basis of secondary metabolites could provide a promising approach to distinguish between the  Boswellia species.
2: Therefore, the individual contents of -KBA, -KBA, -AKBA, and -AKBA, as well as the isomers ratio, were investigated in 41 oleogum resins of nine different  Boswellia species.
3: The keto-boswellic acid contents, and additionally the contents of further boswellic and lupeolic acids, and individual essential oils compositions, were used to explore the ability for chemotaxonomical classification of different  Boswellia species.
