<p>Furthermore, α-KBA and additional keto-boswellic acids were investigated in terms of cytotoxicity against treatment-resistant triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines in vitro and in vivo. With 30%, breast cancers represented the most common cancer type of all new female cancer cases in 2019, causing 15% of all female cancer deaths [

TNBC shows the worst prognosis compared to other breast cancer types, because of the lack of three therapy-relevant receptors, the estrogen receptor (ER), the progesterone receptor (PR), and the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) [
