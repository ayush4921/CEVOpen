0: Boswellia extracts and boswellic acids have been investigated intensively by modern medicine.
1: Their potential therapeutic efficacy against several chronic inflammatory diseases such as bronchial asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohns disease, collagenous colitis, psoriasis, and osteoarthritis was addressed in promising clinical pilot studies [ 3].
2: Furthermore,  Boswellia extracts and boswellic acids induce apoptosis in several cancer cell lines, e.g., from brain cancer, colon cancer, leukemia, and prostate cancer [ 7].
3: Here, boswellic acids interact with human topoisomerases (TOP-I/II) and the proinflammatory enzyme 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX), molecular targets for cancer therapy [ 8, 9].
4: Moreover, boswellic acids inhibit the expression of proinflammatory and prosurvival proteins and tumor-related growth factors by suppressing the activation of the transcription factor NF-B (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) [ 10, 11, 12].
