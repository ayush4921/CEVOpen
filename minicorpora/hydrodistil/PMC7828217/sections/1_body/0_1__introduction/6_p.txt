0: Furthermore, -KBA and additional keto-boswellic acids were investigated in terms of cytotoxicity against treatment-resistant triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines in vitro and in vivo.
1: With 30%, breast cancers represented the most common cancer type of all new female cancer cases in 2019, causing 15% of all female cancer deaths [ 20].
2: Especially, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a particularly aggressive and highly metastatic subtype, which makes up to 15% of all breast cancer cases and affects mainly younger women [ 21].
3: TNBC shows the worst prognosis compared to other breast cancer types, because of the lack of three therapy-relevant receptors, the estrogen receptor (ER), the progesterone receptor (PR), and the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) [ 22].
4: The current study aims to provide information about the structureactivity relationship of keto-boswellic acids, assisting future development of potential new anticancer drugs.
