<p>Boswellic acids exist in two different structural types: α-boswellic acids, based on the oleanane structure, and β-boswellic acids, derived from the ursane structure (

 <xref rid="B14-molecules-26-00366" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Hence, the corresponding boswellic acids represent constitutional isomers. It was assumed that the pharmacologically interesting keto-boswellic acids, 11-keto-β-boswellic acid (β-KBA, or commonly abbreviated as KBA) and acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (β-AKBA, commonly abbreviated as AKBA), only occur as β-isomers [

 <xref rid="B16-molecules-26-00366" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, in 2005, 70 years after the discovery of the first boswellic acids, we could demonstrate that in addition to β-AKBA, the α-isomer acetyl-11-keto-α-boswellic acid (α-AKBA) naturally occurs in

 <xref rid="B18-molecules-26-00366" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. As a result, it was hypothesized that also the deacetylated form, 11-keto-α-boswellic acid (α-KBA), might exist, because biosynthesis of α-AKBA takes place by acetylation of the precursor α-KBA [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-26-00366" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time the existence and the natural occurrence of α-KBA by using a novel, highly selective high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry HPLC-MS/MS method with a pentafluorophenyl (PFP) stationary phase.
