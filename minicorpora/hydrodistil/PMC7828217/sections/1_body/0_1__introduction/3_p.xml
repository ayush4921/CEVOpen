 <italic>Boswellia</italic> extracts and boswellic acids have been investigated intensively by modern medicine. Their potential therapeutic efficacy against several chronic inflammatory diseases such as bronchial asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease, collagenous colitis, psoriasis, and osteoarthritis was addressed in promising clinical pilot studies [

 <italic>Boswellia</italic> extracts and boswellic acids induce apoptosis in several cancer cell lines, e.g., from brain cancer, colon cancer, leukemia, and prostate cancer [

Moreover, boswellic acids inhibit the expression of proinflammatory and prosurvival proteins and tumor-related growth factors by suppressing the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) [
