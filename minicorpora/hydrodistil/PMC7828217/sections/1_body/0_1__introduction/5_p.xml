<p>The botanic and taxonomic assignment of a single 
 <italic>Boswellia</italic> specimen is often hampered by overlapping growth regions, but also by geopolitically unstable conditions within the producing countries [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-26-00366" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-26-00366" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-26-00366" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Besides an outstanding genotyping, a chemotaxonomical classification on the basis of secondary metabolites could provide a promising approach to distinguish between the 
 <italic>Boswellia</italic> species. Therefore, the individual contents of α-KBA, β-KBA, α-AKBA, and β-AKBA, as well as the isomer’s ratio, were investigated in 41 oleogum resins of nine different 
 <italic>Boswellia</italic> species. The keto-boswellic acid contents, and additionally the contents of further boswellic and lupeolic acids, and individual essential oil’s compositions, were used to explore the ability for chemotaxonomical classification of different 
 <italic>Boswellia</italic> species.
