<p>In oleogum resins of 
 <italic>Boswellia</italic> spp., a novel triterpenoid, 11-keto-α-boswellic acid (α-KBA), was identified. α-KBA was synthesized and characterized by 1D and 2D NMR and HR-MS and a highly sensitive and accurate HPLC-MS/MS method for selective evidence and quantification of individual keto-boswellic acids was developed. By means of this method, 41 
 <italic>Boswellia</italic> oleogum resins were investigated and it could be demonstrated that in addition to the well-known 11-keto-β-boswellic acid (β-KBA), its α-constitutional isomer, α-KBA, exists in 
 <italic>Boswellia</italic> spp. On the basis of the individual keto-boswellic acid contents and with inclusion of the chemical composition of essential oils and the composition of the oleogum resins’ boswellic acids, a chemotaxonomic characterization of different 
 <italic>Boswellia</italic> species could be achieved. Moreover, α-KBA exhibited cytotoxicity against human treatment-resistant, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines in vitro and in vivo. However, the β-isomer, β-KBA, and its acetylation enhanced the lipophilicity as well as the cytotoxic efficacy. These results provide a deeper insight into the structure–activity relationship of boswellic acids and point to the necessity for further studies aiming at the development of new anticancer drugs.
