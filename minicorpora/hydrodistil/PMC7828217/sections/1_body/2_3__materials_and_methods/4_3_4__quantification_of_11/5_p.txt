0: For sample preparation, the samples were freshly dissolved in MeOH (  = 1 mg/mL or   = 10 mg/mL).
1: To determine the individual contents, the total content was divided with regard to the ratio of the areas under curves (AUC) of the individual compounds peak within the MRM chromatograms.
2: To ensure a proportional ratio, the linearity was investigated for each individual compound at 10 concentration levels.
3: Thus, this procedure ensured a linear proportion ( p< 0.001) between concentration and AUC in a range of 11000 ng/mL for -KBA, -KBA, -AKBA, and -AKBA.
4: All samples were diluted according to this linear range and analyzed in duplicates to ensure an accurate quantification.
