<p>The quantification of total contents of KBAs and AKBAs was executed by a HPLC-MS/MS method developed, validated, and implemented as previously published [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-26-00366" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-26-00366" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. To quantify the individual constitutional isomers of KBAs and AKBAs, a novel method was developed by means of Design of Experiments (DoE) with central composite design (CCD). Here, a pentafluorophenyl column (Dr. Maisch, Fluorsil 100 PFP, 3 µm, 100 × 3 mm; Dr. Maisch GmbH, Ammerbruch, Germany) with a C18 precolumn (Dr. Maisch ReproSil Universal RP, 5 µm, 10 × 4 mm) were used. To ensure an orthogonal experimental design, the distances, α, between the center point and the axial points of the star design were calculated with following formula:
