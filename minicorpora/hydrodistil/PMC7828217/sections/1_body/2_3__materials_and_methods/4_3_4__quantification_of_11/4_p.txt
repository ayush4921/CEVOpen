0: The MS/MS analysis was performed in the negative ionization mode with multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) detection.
1: The atmospheric pressure electrospray ion source was heated to 400 C and the ion spray voltage was set to 4250 V. Collision energy was optimized to 40 V and the dwell time to 250 ms.
2: The precursor ion at  m/z 469.4 and the product ion with the highest intensity at  m/z 391.4 were selected for -KBA and -KBA.
3: Similarly, the precursor ion at  m/z 511.4 and the product ion  m/z 59.0 were used for -AKBA and -AKBA.
