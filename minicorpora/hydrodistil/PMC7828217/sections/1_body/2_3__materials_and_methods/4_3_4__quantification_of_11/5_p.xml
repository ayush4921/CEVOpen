<p>For sample preparation, the samples were freshly dissolved in MeOH (
 <italic>β</italic> = 1 mg/mL or 
 <italic>β</italic> = 10 mg/mL). To determine the individual contents, the total content was divided with regard to the ratio of the areas under curves (AUC) of the individual compound’s peak within the MRM chromatograms. To ensure a proportional ratio, the linearity was investigated for each individual compound at 10 concentration levels. Thus, this procedure ensured a linear proportion (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) between concentration and AUC in a range of 1–1000 ng/mL for α-KBA, β-KBA, α-AKBA, and β-AKBA. All samples were diluted according to this linear range and analyzed in duplicates to ensure an accurate quantification.
