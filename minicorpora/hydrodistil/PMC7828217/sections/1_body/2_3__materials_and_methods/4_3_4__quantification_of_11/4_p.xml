<p>The MS/MS analysis was performed in the negative ionization mode with multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) detection. The atmospheric pressure electrospray ion source was heated to 400 °C and the ion spray voltage was set to −4250 V. Collision energy was optimized to −40 V and the dwell time to 250 ms. The precursor ion at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 469.4 and the product ion with the highest intensity at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 391.4 were selected for α-KBA and β-KBA. Similarly, the precursor ion at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 511.4 and the product ion 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 59.0 were used for α-AKBA and β-AKBA.
