0: The quantification of total contents of KBAs and AKBAs was executed by a HPLC-MS/MS method developed, validated, and implemented as previously published [ 5, 27].
1: To quantify the individual constitutional isomers of KBAs and AKBAs, a novel method was developed by means of Design of Experiments (DoE) with central composite design (CCD).
2: Here, a pentafluorophenyl column (Dr. Maisch, Fluorsil 100 PFP, 3 m, 100  3 mm; Dr. Maisch GmbH, Ammerbruch, Germany) with a C18 precolumn (Dr. Maisch ReproSil Universal RP, 5 m, 10  4 mm) were used.
3: To ensure an orthogonal experimental design, the distances, , between the center point and the axial points of the star design were calculated with following formula: (2)2= 12(NNC  NC) where  N is the total number of experiments and  N  C is the number of experiments of the cube, i.e., the full two-level factorial design [ 29].
4: The experiments were carried out in a randomized order to avoid falsification of the model by bias.
5: The evaluation of the effects was done with the help of normal probability plots.
