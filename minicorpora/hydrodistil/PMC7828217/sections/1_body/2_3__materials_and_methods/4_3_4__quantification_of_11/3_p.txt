0: The mobile phase consisted of eluent A, MeOH/water (60/40,  v/v), and eluent B, MeOH, both acidified with 0.2% acetic acid.
1: The injection volume was 20 L and the column was kept at a stable temperature of 28 C. On the basis of the results obtained by the DoE, the method herein was developed: Initial conditions were 92% eluent A and 8% eluent B, followed by a linear gradient to 62% eluent B over 44.5 min, and subsequent linear gradient to 95% eluent B until 45.0 min.
2: Thereafter, 95% eluent B until 54.5 min, followed by linear gradient to initial condition until 55.0 min, and re-equilibration until 60.0 min.
3: Here, the flow rate of the mobile phase was 690 L/min.
