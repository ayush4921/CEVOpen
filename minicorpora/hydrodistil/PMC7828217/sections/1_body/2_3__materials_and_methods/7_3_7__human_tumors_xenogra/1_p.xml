<p>For investigation of antitumor activity against TNBC xenografts in vivo, 0.7 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> MDA-MB-231 cells in medium/matrigel (1/1, 
 <italic>v/v</italic>) were xenografted onto the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of fertilized chick eggs 7 days after fertilization. For the next three consecutive days, cells were treated topically with 10 or 50 µM of α-KBA and α-AKBA respectively, or 10 µM doxorubicin dissolved in 0.9% NaCl (vehicle control: 0.5% DMSO). Tumors were collected, imaged, fixed, and embedded in paraffin for analysis by immunohistochemistry on the fourth day after treatment initiation. Tumor volumes (mm
 <sup>3</sup>) were calculated with the formula length (mm) × width
 <sup>2</sup> (mm
 <sup>2</sup>) × π/6 [
 <xref rid="B63-molecules-26-00366" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. For immunohistochemical analysis, slices (D = 5 µm) of the collected tumor specimens were stained using hematoxylin and eosin. Furthermore, the slices were stained with antibodies against the nuclear proliferation marker Ki-67 (M7240; Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). DNA strand breaks were stained by deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP (deoxyuridine triphosphate) nick end labeling (TUNEL; Roche, Basel, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer´s recommendations to visualize apoptosis in vivo. Images were recorded by means of an Axio Lab.A1 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) and a Zeiss 2/3” CMOS camera using Progres Gryphax software (Jenoptik, Jena, Germany).
