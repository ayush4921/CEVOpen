0: For investigation of antitumor activity against TNBC xenografts in vivo, 0.7  10 6 MDA-MB-231 cells in medium/matrigel (1/1,  v/v) were xenografted onto the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of fertilized chick eggs 7 days after fertilization.
1: For the next three consecutive days, cells were treated topically with 10 or 50 M of -KBA and -AKBA respectively, or 10 M doxorubicin dissolved in 0.9% NaCl (vehicle control: 0.5% DMSO).
2: Tumors were collected, imaged, fixed, and embedded in paraffin for analysis by immunohistochemistry on the fourth day after treatment initiation.
3: Tumor volumes (mm 3) were calculated with the formula length (mm)  width 2 (mm 2)  /6 [ 63].
4: For immunohistochemical analysis, slices (D = 5 m) of the collected tumor specimens were stained using hematoxylin and eosin.
5: Furthermore, the slices were stained with antibodies against the nuclear proliferation marker Ki-67 (M7240; Dako, Glostrup, Denmark).
6: DNA strand breaks were stained by deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP (deoxyuridine triphosphate) nick end labeling (TUNEL; Roche, Basel, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer s recommendations to visualize apoptosis in vivo.
7: Images were recorded by means of an Axio Lab.A1 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) and a Zeiss 2/3 CMOS camera using Progres Gryphax software (Jenoptik, Jena, Germany).
