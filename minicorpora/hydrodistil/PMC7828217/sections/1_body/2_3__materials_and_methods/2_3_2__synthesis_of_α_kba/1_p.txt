0: -KBA was synthesized by saponification of -AKBA.
1: For this purpose, 6.99 mg (13.6 mol) of -AKBA was dissolved in 420 L of 10% KOH in MeOH ( m/v).
2: For base hydrolysis, the solution was heated to 75 C for 25 min with continuous stirring.
3: The reaction was stopped by adding 420 L concentrated acetic acid yielding a pH value of 4.5.
4: The reaction product was precipitated by adding 1000 L warm water and subsequently cooling down for 30 min at 4 C. Afterwards, the product was washed three times with 1000 L cold water and dried by lyophilization yielding 5.73 mg raw product.
