<p>The raw product was purified by semi-preparative HPLC using a LC-9A HPLC pump (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan), an IWN CH100 column oven (Junedis, Gröbenzell, Germany), an UVD 340 U photodiode array detector (Dionex, Idstein, Germany), and a fraction collector (Gilson, Limburg-Offheim, Germany). Instruments were controlled and data processed by Chromeleon software version 6.6 (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). For purification, a semi-preparative column (Phenomenex, Synergi Hydro-RP, 4 μm, 80 Å, 250 × 10 mm) with a precolumn (Phenomenex, SecurityGuard, C18, 4 × 3 mm) was used. The raw product was dissolved in 1000 µL DMSO and filtered through a 0.45 µm regenerated cellulose filter. The flow rate was 5000 µL/min and the injection volume was 250 µL. The mobile phase consisted of eluent A, MeOH/water (60/40, 
 <italic>v/v</italic>), and eluent B, MeOH, both acidified with 0.2% acetic acid. Initial conditions were 30% eluent A and 70% eluent B followed by a linear gradient to 90% eluent B over 15 min, then 90% eluent B until 25 min. Thereafter, followed a linear gradient to initial conditions until 25.5 min and re-equilibration continued until 30 min. In order to stabilize the chromatographic system, the column was kept at a temperature of 28 °C.
