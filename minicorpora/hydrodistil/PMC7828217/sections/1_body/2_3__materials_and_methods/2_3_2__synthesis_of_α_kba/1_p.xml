<p>α-KBA was synthesized by saponification of α-AKBA. For this purpose, 6.99 mg (13.6 µmol) of α-AKBA was dissolved in 420 µL of 10% KOH in MeOH (
 <italic>m/v</italic>). For base hydrolysis, the solution was heated to 75 °C for 25 min with continuous stirring. The reaction was stopped by adding 420 µL concentrated acetic acid yielding a pH value of 4.5. The reaction product was precipitated by adding 1000 µL warm water and subsequently cooling down for 30 min at 4 °C. Afterwards, the product was washed three times with 1000 µL cold water and dried by lyophilization yielding 5.73 mg raw product.
