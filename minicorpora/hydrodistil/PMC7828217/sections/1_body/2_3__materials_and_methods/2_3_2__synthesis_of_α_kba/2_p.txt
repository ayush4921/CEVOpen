0: The raw product was purified by semi-preparative HPLC using a LC-9A HPLC pump (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan), an IWN CH100 column oven (Junedis, Grobenzell, Germany), an UVD 340 U photodiode array detector (Dionex, Idstein, Germany), and a fraction collector (Gilson, Limburg-Offheim, Germany).
1: Instruments were controlled and data processed by Chromeleon software version 6.6 (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).
2: For purification, a semi-preparative column (Phenomenex, Synergi Hydro-RP, 4 m, 80 A, 250  10 mm) with a precolumn (Phenomenex, SecurityGuard, C18, 4  3 mm) was used.
3: The raw product was dissolved in 1000 L DMSO and filtered through a 0.45 m regenerated cellulose filter.
4: The flow rate was 5000 L/min and the injection volume was 250 L. The mobile phase consisted of eluent A, MeOH/water (60/40,  v/v), and eluent B, MeOH, both acidified with 0.2% acetic acid.
5: Initial conditions were 30% eluent A and 70% eluent B followed by a linear gradient to 90% eluent B over 15 min, then 90% eluent B until 25 min.
6: Thereafter, followed a linear gradient to initial conditions until 25.5 min and re-equilibration continued until 30 min.
7: In order to stabilize the chromatographic system, the column was kept at a temperature of 28 C.
