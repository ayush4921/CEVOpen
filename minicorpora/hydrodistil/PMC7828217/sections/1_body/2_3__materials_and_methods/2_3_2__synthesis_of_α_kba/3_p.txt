0: The collected fractions were concentrated with a nitrogen stream first, and then dried by lyophilization, yielding 3.94 mg (8.37 mol) -KBA.
1: This corresponds to a total yield of 61.8% ( n/n).
2: Purity control by high-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array detection (HPLC-DAD) at 210, 254, and 280 nm exhibited a purity > 99%.
