0: Triple-negative human breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 (ATCC, Rockville, MD, USA), CAL-51 (DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany), and CAL-148 (DSMZ), as well as peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were analyzed.
1: PBMC were isolated from whole venous blood from healthy male donors via density gradient centrifugation using Biocoll (Biochrom GmbH, Berlin, Germany).
2: Informed consent of the volunteers and approval of the institutional Ethics Committee (#177/18) were obtained.
3: MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in Dulbeccos Modified Eagle Medium (4.5 g/L glucose, GlutaMax; Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 10% FCS (fetal calf serum), 0.1 mM MEM (minimum essential medium) non-essential amino acids, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin.
4: CAL-51 cells were cultured in Dulbecco s Modified Eagle Medium (4.5 g/L glucose; Life Technologies, Carlsbad CA, USA) supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin.
5: CAL-148 cells were cultured in Dulbecco s Modified Eagle Medium (4.5 g/L glucose; Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 mg/mL streptomycin, and 10 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF).
6: All cancer cell lines were cultured in a humidified incubator at 37 C and 5% CO 2 (MDA-MB-251 und CAL-51) or 10% CO 2 (CAL-148) atmosphere.
7: Cells were sub-cultured according to the suppliers recommendations after reaching 80% confluence.
8: For the experiments, 5000 cells/well of the respective cancer cell lines or 300,000 PBMC/well were seeded into 96-well plates in medium supplemented with 10% FCS overnight and treated 24 h after seeding.
9: Respective concentrations of the samples were applied by means of a Tecan D300e Digital Dispenser (Tecan, Mannedorf, Switzerland).
10: After a 72 h incubation period, cell viability was analyzed by addition of 2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide salt (XTT; AppliChem GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany).
11: Absorbance of the formed orange formazan dye was measured using an Infinite M1000 PRO Tecan plate reader (Tecan) at  = 450 nm with a  = 630 nm reference filter.
12: For quantification of cell viability, the blank values containing the respective compounds in the according concentration were subtracted and the percentage of viable cells was calculated by normalization to the vehicle control.
