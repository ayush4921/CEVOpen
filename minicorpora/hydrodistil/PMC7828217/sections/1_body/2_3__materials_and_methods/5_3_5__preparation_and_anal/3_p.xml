<p>GC-MS analysis of essential oils was performed on an Agilent 7890B/5977B system equipped with a HP-5MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 µm). Helium was used as a carrier gas (1.0 mL/min, constant flow). Oven temperature started at 40 °C for 2 min, followed by linear gradient to 270 °C by 4 °C/min, and then held for 5 min. Essential oil samples were injected neat with a volume of 0.5 µL and a split of 50:1, with an inlet temperature of 250 °C. Compounds were identified using their retention indexes as calculated from a homologous series of
