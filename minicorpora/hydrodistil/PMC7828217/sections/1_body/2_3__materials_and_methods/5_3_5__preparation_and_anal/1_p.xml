<p>Essential oils were obtained by hydrodistillation of 
 <italic>Boswellia</italic> spp. oleogum resins. For each approach, respectively, 100 g oleogum resin of 
 <italic>B. sacra</italic> (sample # 1), 
 <italic>B. serrata</italic> (sample # 18), 
 <italic>B. carterii</italic> (sample # 25), 
 <italic>B. frereana</italic> (sample # 38), 
 <italic>B. dalzielli</italic> (sample # 12), 
 <italic>B. papyrifera</italic> (sample # 15), 
 <italic>B. neglecta</italic> (sample # 35), or 
 <italic>B. rivae</italic> (sample # 37) were added to 250 mL water and mixed for several minutes until a thick homogenous dispersion was formed. For hydrodistillation, the mixtures were subsequently heated for 6–7 h at 120–125 °C with continuous stirring. The obtained essential oils were carefully separated from the aqueous phase with the help of a separating funnel, yielding 1.2–9.7% essential oils (
 <italic>w/w</italic>), respectively.
