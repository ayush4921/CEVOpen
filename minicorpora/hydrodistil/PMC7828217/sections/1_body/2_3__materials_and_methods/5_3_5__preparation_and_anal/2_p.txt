0: GC-FID analysis of essential oils was performed on an Agilent 7890A system equipped with a DB-5 capillary column (10 m  0.10 mm  0.10 m) and a DB-Wax capillary column (10 m  0.10 mm  0.10 m).
1: Hydrogen was used as carrier gas (0.7 mL/min, constant flow).
2: Oven temperature started at 35 C for 1 min, followed by linear gradient to 260 C by 9 C/min, and then held for 10 min.
3: Essential oil samples were diluted at roughly 20 mg/mL in GC-grade pentane and were injected with a volume of 1 L and a split of 50:1 with an inlet temperature of 250 C.
