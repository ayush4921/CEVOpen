<p>GC-FID analysis of essential oils was performed on an Agilent 7890A system equipped with a DB-5 capillary column (10 m × 0.10 mm × 0.10 µm) and a DB-Wax capillary column (10 m × 0.10 mm × 0.10 µm). Hydrogen was used as carrier gas (0.7 mL/min, constant flow). Oven temperature started at 35 °C for 1 min, followed by linear gradient to 260 °C by 9 °C/min, and then held for 10 min. Essential oil samples were diluted at roughly 20 mg/mL in GC-grade pentane and were injected with a volume of 1 µL and a split of 50:1 with an inlet temperature of 250 °C.</p>
