0: Essential oils were obtained by hydrodistillation of  Boswellia spp.
1: oleogum resins.
2: For each approach, respectively, 100 g oleogum resin of  B. sacra (sample # 1),  B. serrata (sample # 18),  B. carterii (sample # 25),  B. frereana (sample # 38),  B. dalzielli (sample # 12),  B. papyrifera (sample # 15),  B. neglecta (sample # 35), or  B. rivae (sample # 37) were added to 250 mL water and mixed for several minutes until a thick homogenous dispersion was formed.
3: For hydrodistillation, the mixtures were subsequently heated for 67 h at 120125 C with continuous stirring.
4: The obtained essential oils were carefully separated from the aqueous phase with the help of a separating funnel, yielding 1.29.7% essential oils ( w/w), respectively.
