0: GC-MS analysis of essential oils was performed on an Agilent 7890B/5977B system equipped with a HP-5MS capillary column (30 m  0.25 mm  0.25 m).
1: Helium was used as a carrier gas (1.0 mL/min, constant flow).
2: Oven temperature started at 40 C for 2 min, followed by linear gradient to 270 C by 4 C/min, and then held for 5 min.
3: Essential oil samples were injected neat with a volume of 0.5 L and a split of 50:1, with an inlet temperature of 250 C. Compounds were identified using their retention indexes as calculated from a homologous series of  n-alkanes and mass spectra comparisons with NIST14 libraries, in-house libraries, and specialist literature [ 61, 62].
