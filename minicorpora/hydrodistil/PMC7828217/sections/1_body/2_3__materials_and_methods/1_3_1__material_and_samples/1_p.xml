<p>All solvents and chemicals were of analytical reagent grade. The solvents used for the extraction, sample preparation, and HPLC-MS/MS analysis were MeOH, acetic acid (both HiPerSolv Chromanorm, VWR chemicals, Fontenay-sous-Bois, France), and ultrapure water (reverse-osmosis type water (pureAqua, Schnaitsee, Germany)) coupled to a Milli-Q station (Millipore, Eschborn, Germany). The compounds 11-keto-β-boswellic acid (β-KBA) and acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (β-AKBA) were purchased from Extrasynthese (Genay Cedex, France). Acetyl-11-keto-α-boswellic acid (α-AKBA) was synthesized and characterized as previously described [
