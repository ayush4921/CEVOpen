0: All solvents and chemicals were of analytical reagent grade.
1: The solvents used for the extraction, sample preparation, and HPLC-MS/MS analysis were MeOH, acetic acid (both HiPerSolv Chromanorm, VWR chemicals, Fontenay-sous-Bois, France), and ultrapure water (reverse-osmosis type water (pureAqua, Schnaitsee, Germany)) coupled to a Milli-Q station (Millipore, Eschborn, Germany).
2: The compounds 11-keto--boswellic acid (-KBA) and acetyl-11-keto--boswellic acid (-AKBA) were purchased from Extrasynthese (Genay Cedex, France).
3: Acetyl-11-keto--boswellic acid (-AKBA) was synthesized and characterized as previously described [ 17].
