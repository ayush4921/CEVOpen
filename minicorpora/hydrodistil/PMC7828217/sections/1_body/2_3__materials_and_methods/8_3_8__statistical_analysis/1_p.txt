0: Experiments for HPLC-MS/MS quantifications were carried out in duplicates and all in vitro and in vivo experiments in at least three independent experiments.
1: All in vitro experiments were additionally performed in triplicates.
2: The data are expressed as mean  standard deviation (SD) or standard error of the mean (SEM), as indicated.
3: Statistical analysis was performed with Minitab 18 software (Minitab, Munich, Germany), SigmaPlot 14.0 software (Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA, USA), and Valoo 2.10 software (Applica, Bremen, Germany).
4: All data were tested for normal distribution by the Anderson-Darling test and equality of variances by Levene s test.
5: Sample groups were compared by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post hoc by Dunett s test or by Fishers least significant difference (LSD) test.
6: Comparison of two sample groups was executed by Student s  t-test.
7: Results with 0.001   p< 0.05 were considered as statistically significant and  p< 0.001 as highly significant.
8: Principal component analysis (PCA) was derived from a correlation matrix of the raw data yielding  (3)PC1=1.415 [-KBA]+1.437 [-KBA]+1.636 [-AKBA]+1.502 [-AKBA] and  (4)PC2=1.709 [-KBA]1.345 [-KBA]+1.001 [-AKBA]+1.807 [-AKBA] with concentrations of the corresponding KBAs or AKBAs in g/mg oleogum resin given in square brackets.
