<p>A high-resolution mass spectrum of α-KBA was recorded with a 12 Tesla solariX FT-ICR-MS (Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer; Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) equipped with an APOLLO II electrospray source (Bruker Daltonics) and operated in the negative ionization mode. A diluted sample (
 <italic>β</italic> = 10 µg/mL in MeOH/water (7/3, 
 <italic>v/v</italic>)) was infused into the MS with a constant flow rate of 120 µL/h. Spectra were acquired with a time-domain of 4 megawords and 30 scans were accumulated within an 
 <italic>m/z</italic> range from 147 to 750. Calibration of the MS and ion source settings were the same as recently described [
 <xref rid="B60-molecules-26-00366" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. The MS method achieved highest resolving power of 393,000 at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 469.332267 and superb mass accuracy in the ppb range.
