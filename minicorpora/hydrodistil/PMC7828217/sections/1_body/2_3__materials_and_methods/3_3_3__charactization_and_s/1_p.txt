0: A high-resolution mass spectrum of -KBA was recorded with a 12 Tesla solariX FT-ICR-MS (Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer; Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) equipped with an APOLLO II electrospray source (Bruker Daltonics) and operated in the negative ionization mode.
1: A diluted sample (  = 10 g/mL in MeOH/water (7/3,  v/v)) was infused into the MS with a constant flow rate of 120 L/h.
2: Spectra were acquired with a time-domain of 4 megawords and 30 scans were accumulated within an  m/z range from 147 to 750.
3: Calibration of the MS and ion source settings were the same as recently described [ 60].
4: The MS method achieved highest resolving power of 393,000 at  m/z 469.332267 and superb mass accuracy in the ppb range.
