0: The antimicrobial activity assay of the essential oil of  P. dioica leaves was performed using the agar diffusion method recommended by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) (KirbyBauer method).
1: The assay disks (Whatman, 6 mm, 420 g/m 2) were impregnated with 10 uL of pure essential oil and allowed to dry for 24 h. A Mueller Hinton agar was inoculated using a bacteria concentration equivalent to the MacFarland 0.5 standard, in three directions and the oil disks were arranged at equivalent distances.
2: The boxes were incubated at 37 C or 24 h to subsequently measure the inhibition halo in millimeters.
3: The assays for the oils with each bacteria were carried out in triplicate [ 24, 25, 26, 27, 28].
