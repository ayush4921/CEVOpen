0: Oils of dried fruits and dried leaves of  P. dioica were extracted in triplicates from 50.0 g of each organ by hydrodistillation method for 2 h in a Clevenger-type apparatus for 2 h and collected in pentane.
1: After extraction, pentane was removed with a rotatory evaporator at 40 C and the oils were weighed in an analytical scale, yielding 1.37% ( w/ w) for fruits and 0.58% ( w/ w) for leaves.
2: All the extractions were made in triplicate and the reported yield corresponds to the average of the three extractions plusminus a standard deviation.
