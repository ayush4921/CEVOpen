<p>The authors suggest that this activity can be attributed to eugenol and (
 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene since these compounds have been found recurrently in the essential oils of 
 <italic>P. dioica</italic> leaves [

 <xref rid="B11-medicines-07-00059" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In essential oils that have a high content of eugenol, this compound has been attributed as the main one responsible for the antimicrobial activity, as in the case of clove essential oil [

Among the mechanisms that have been proposed for the action of eugenol against bacteria, a recent review about the antimicrobial activity of eugenol mentions that eugenol has a disruptive action on the cytoplasmic membrane and that it inhibits the production of virulence factors such as violacein, elastase, and procyanin. In the case of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, eugenol acts by reducing the production of pyocyanin, inhibits the formation of enterohemorrhagic 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> biofilms, as well as the mechanisms responsible for activity. In the case of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, eugenol inhibits and eradicates the biofilms produced by this bacterium [
