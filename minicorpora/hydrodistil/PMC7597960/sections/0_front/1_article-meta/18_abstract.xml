  <bold>Background:</bold>
  <italic>Pimenta dioica</italic> is a native tree of Central America, Southern Mexico, and the Caribbean used in traditional medicine. It grows in wet forests in the Guatemalan departments of Petén and Izabal. Since the plant is not being economically exploited in Guatemala, this study was aimed at determining the composition of the essential oil of 
  <italic>P. dioica</italic> leaves and fruits and the antibacterial activity of the leaves in order to evaluate its possible use in health products. The essential oils of fruits and leaves are used as rubefacient, anti-inflammatory, carminative, antioxidant, and antiflatulent in different countries. 
  <bold>Methods:</bold> Fruits and leaves of 
  <italic>P. dioica</italic> from Izabal Department were collected in April 2014 and extracted by hydrodistillation method. The oils were analyzed by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC/MS). 
  <bold>Results:</bold> Yields of 1.02 ± 0.11% for dried leaves and 1.51 ± 0.26% for fruits were obtained. Eugenol was the main component (65.9–71.4%). The leaf oil showed growth inhibition against two Gram-positive and two Gram-negative bacteria. 
  <bold>Conclusions:</bold> The authors consider that the tree’s leaves can be evaluated as a source of ingredients for antiseptic products, and that it is important to evaluate other types of properties such as anti-inflammatory activity.
