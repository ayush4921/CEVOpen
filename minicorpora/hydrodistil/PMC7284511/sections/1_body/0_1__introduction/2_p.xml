<p>Based on the utility and properties of Lauraceae essential oils, it is hypothesized that members of the Lauraceae found in Vietnam have biologically active essential oils that may be useful in controlling mosquito populations or as antimicrobial agents. Eleven species of Lauraceae from north-central Vietnam have been collected, the essential oils obtained by hydrodistillation, chemical compositions analyzed, and the oils screened for mosquito larvicidal activity and for antimicrobial activity.</p>
