<p>Of the eleven species of Lauraceae examined in this work, the leaf essential oil of 
 <italic>Neolitsea ellipsoidea</italic>, dominated by (
 <italic>E</italic>)-β-ocimene, showed excellent larvicidal activity against 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> and 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic>; 
 <italic>Cryptocarya infectoria</italic> leaf essential oil, rich in germacrene D and bicyclogermacrene, showed excellent larvicidal activity on 
 <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> and anticandidal activity against 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>. The leaf essential oil of 
 <italic>Litsea viridis</italic>, which was rich in bicyclogermacrene, also showed good antibacterial properties. The biological properties of these Lauraceae essential oils suggest that they may serve as potential “green” alternatives, as also described for Lamiaceae family plants [
 <xref rid="B63-plants-09-00606" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], for use as insect control or antimicrobial agents.
