<p>The components responsible for the anticandidal activity of 
 <italic>C. impressa</italic> leaf essential oil are not obvious. Neither (
 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene nor α-humulene have shown strong anti-
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> activity [

 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene do not exhibit notable activity against 
 <italic>Candida</italic> spp. [
