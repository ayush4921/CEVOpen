<p>The major component of 
 <italic>L. viridis</italic> leaf oil, bicyclogermacrene, has shown antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B53-plants-09-00606" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Likewise, β-pinene was shown to be active against 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B54-plants-09-00606" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] as well as several other Gram-positive organisms [
 <xref rid="B55-plants-09-00606" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Similarly, α-pinene has activity against several Gram-positive bacteria [

 <xref rid="B56-plants-09-00606" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Decanal has also exhibited antibacterial activity [

 <xref rid="B58-plants-09-00606" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Thus, the major components of 
 <italic>L. viridis</italic> leaf essential oil, bicyclogermacrene, decanal, α-pinene, and β-pinene, can account for the observed antibacterial activity.
