 <italic>L. viridis</italic> and 
 <italic>N. ellipsoidea</italic> leaf essential oils demonstrated particularly notable activities against 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic> and 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 16 μg/mL. The leaf essential oil of 
 <italic>C. impressa</italic> also showed excellent anticandidal activity against
