<p>The major components in 
 <italic>B. erythrophloia</italic> essential oil were bicyclogermacrene (30.5%), (
 <italic>Z</italic>)-β-ocimene (26.1%), and (
 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene (18.3%). While qualitatively similar, there are notable differences between the essential oil from Vietnam in this work and that reported by Su and Ho from Taiwan [
 <xref rid="B17-plants-09-00606" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]; the sample from Taiwan was rich in α-humulene (21.9%) compared to that from Vietnam (only 2.6%), but poor in bicyclogermacrene (1.2%) compared to that from Vietnam.
