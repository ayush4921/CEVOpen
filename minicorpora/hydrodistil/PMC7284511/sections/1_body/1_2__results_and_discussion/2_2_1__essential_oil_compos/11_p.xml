<p>The leaf essential oil of 
 <italic>P. angustifolia</italic> from Pù Hoạt Nature Reserve (northern Vietnam) in this study was rich in α-pinene (26.9%), β-pinene (20.8%), spathulenol (5.4%), (

 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (5.0%), which differs markedly from a previous study on the leaf essential oil from Sao La Nature Reserve (central Vietnam). The previous work reported spathulenol (17.0%), palmitic acid (13.0%), sabinene (6.4%), bicyclogermacrene (5.9%), and artemisia triene (5.1%) to be the major components [
