<p>The leaf essential oils of 
 <italic>C. concinna</italic> from two different collection sites were qualitatively similar, but quantitatively different. That is, the abundant components in the Nam Dong sample were also observed in the Pu Hoat sample, and vice versa. Thus, for example, α-pinene, β-pinene, and myrcene were abundant in the Pu Hoat sample (26.7%, 31.3%, and 11.1%, respectively) but were found in lower concentrations in the sample from Nam Dong (8.2%, 9.0%, and 3.9%). Conversely, the sesquiterpenoids, (
 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene, spathulenol, and caryophyllene oxide were abundant in the sample from Nam Dong (12.2%, 12.3%, and 21.2%, respectively), but less concentrated in the Pu Hoat sample (5.3%, 1.1%, and 0.4%).
