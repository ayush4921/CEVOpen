<p>Although 
 <italic>M. balansae</italic> and 
 <italic>M. grandifolia</italic> are considered conspecific, the essential oil compositions showed pronounced differences. The leaf oil of 
 <italic>M. balansae</italic> was dominated by bicyclogermacrene (41.5%), which was not detected in the essential oil of 
 <italic>M. grandifolia</italic>. Likewise, the sesquiterpene alcohols (
 <italic>E</italic>)-nerolidol and globulol were abundant constituents in 
 <italic>M. grandifolia</italic> (22.7% and 10.2%, respectively), but (
 <italic>E</italic>)-nerolidol was much lower in 
 <italic>M. balansae</italic> (8.7%) and globulol was not detected. The taxonomy of these two plants deserves closer scrutiny.
