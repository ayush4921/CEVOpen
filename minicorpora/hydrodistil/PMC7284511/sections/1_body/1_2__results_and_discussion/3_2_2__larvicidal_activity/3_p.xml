<p>The major component of 
 <italic>N. ellipsoidea</italic> leaf essential oil, (
 <italic>E</italic>)-β-ocimene (87.6%), is not likely responsible for the observed larvicidal activity. The (
 <italic>E</italic>)-β-ocimene-rich (94.8%) essential oil of 
 <italic>Porophyllum ruderale</italic> showed an LC
 <sub>50</sub> of 173.7 μg/mL against 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> [
 <xref rid="B44-plants-09-00606" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Likewise, the essential oil of 
 <italic>Syzygium jambolana</italic>, with (
 <italic>Z</italic>)-β-ocimene (27.2%) and (
 <italic>E</italic>)-β-ocimene (12.2%), was inactive against 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (LC
 <sub>50</sub> = 433 μg/mL) [
 <xref rid="B45-plants-09-00606" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The excellent larvicidal activity of 
 <italic>N. ellipsoidea</italic> essential oil can likely be attributed to synergistic effects involving minor components.
