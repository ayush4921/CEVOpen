<p>The leaf essential oil of 
 <italic>C. infectoria</italic> was rich in the germacrene sesquiterpenes germacrene D (55.5%) and bicyclogermacrene (11.4%), and these compounds may be responsible for the larvicidal activity. Germacrene D has demonstrated notable larvicidal activity against 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> (LC
 <sub>50</sub> = 18.8 and 21.3 μg/mL, respectively) [
