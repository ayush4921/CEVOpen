<p>Of the Lauraceae essential oils screened for larvicidal activity, 
 <italic>N. ellipsoidea</italic> showed the greatest activity against 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> with 24-h and 48-h LC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 6.59 and 4.04 μg/mL, respectively. Similar larvicidal activities were observed against 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> (24-h and 48-h LC
 <sub>50</sub> = 7.47 and 4.65 μg/mL) for this essential oil. Interestingly, although the larvicidal activities of 
 <italic>C. infectoria</italic> leaf essential oil were not as impressive against 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> or 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>, the essential oil did show much better activity against 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> (24-h LC
 <sub>50</sub> = 10.8 μg/mL), particularly after 48 h of exposure (48-h LC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.402 μg/mL). Unfortunately, the limited quantities available for several of the essential oils precluded larvicidal screening. However, the larvicidal activity of the untested essential oils will be investigated in future studies.
