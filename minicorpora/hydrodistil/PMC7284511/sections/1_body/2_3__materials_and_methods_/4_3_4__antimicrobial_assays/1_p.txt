0: The bacterial growth inhibition of the essential oils was evaluated using three strains of Gram-positive test bacteria,  Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC299212),  Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC25923),  Bacillus cereus (ATCC14579), three strains of Gram-negative test bacteria,  Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922),  Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC27853),  Salmonella enterica (ATCC13076) and one strain of yeast,  Candida albicans (ATCC 10231).
1: Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and median inhibitory concentration (IC 50) values were measured by the microdilution broth susceptibility assay as previously described [ 62].
