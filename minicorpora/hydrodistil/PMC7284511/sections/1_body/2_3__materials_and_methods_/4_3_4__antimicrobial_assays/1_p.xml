<p>The bacterial growth inhibition of the essential oils was evaluated using three strains of Gram-positive test bacteria, 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> (ATCC299212), 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (ATCC25923), 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> (ATCC14579), three strains of Gram-negative test bacteria, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (ATCC 25922), 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (ATCC27853), 
 <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> (ATCC13076) and one strain of yeast, 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> (ATCC 10231). Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and median inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) values were measured by the microdilution broth susceptibility assay as previously described [
