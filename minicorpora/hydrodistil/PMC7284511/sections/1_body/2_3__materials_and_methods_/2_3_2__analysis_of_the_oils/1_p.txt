0: Gas chromatographic (GC) analysis was performed on an Agilent Technologies HP 7890A Plus Gas chromatograph equipped with a FID and fitted with HP-5ms column (30 m  0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 m, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA).
1: The analytical conditions were: carrier gas H 2 (1 mL/min), injector temperature (PTV: programmable temperature vaporization) 250 C, detector temperature 260 C, column temperature programmed from 60 C (2 min hold) to 220 C (10 min hold) at 4 C/min.
2: Samples were injected using a split mode with a split ratio of 10:1.
3: The volume injected was 1.0 L. Inlet pressure was 6.1 kPa.
