0: An Agilent Technologies (Santa Clara, CA, USA) HP 7890A Plus Chromatograph fitted with a fused silica capillary HP-5ms column (30 m  0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 m) and interfaced with a mass spectrometer HP 5973 MSD was used for the GC/MS analysis, under the same conditions as those used for GC analysis.
1: The conditions were the same as described above with He (1 mL/min) as carrier gas.
2: The MS conditions were as follows: ionization voltage 70 eV; emission current 40 mA; acquisitions scan mass range of 35350 amu at a sampling rate of 1.0 scan/s.
3: Compound identification was carried out by comparison of the MS fragmentation patterns and calculated retention indices with those available in the databases [ 35, 36, 37] and, when available, with standard substances.
