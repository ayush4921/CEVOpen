<p>Gas chromatographic (GC) analysis was performed on an Agilent Technologies HP 7890A Plus Gas chromatograph equipped with a FID and fitted with HP-5ms column (30 m × 0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 μm, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The analytical conditions were: carrier gas H
 <sub>2</sub> (1 mL/min), injector temperature (PTV: programmable temperature vaporization) 250 °C, detector temperature 260 °C, column temperature programmed from 60 °C (2 min hold) to 220 °C (10 min hold) at 4 °C/min. Samples were injected using a split mode with a split ratio of 10:1. The volume injected was 1.0 μL. Inlet pressure was 6.1 kPa.
