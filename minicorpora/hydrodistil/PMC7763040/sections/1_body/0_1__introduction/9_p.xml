<p>AD therapy is commonly based on inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), the enzyme responsible to the hydrolysis of acetylcholine in several cholinergic pathways in the central and peripheral nervous systems. However, it was found that AChE activity remains unchanged or declines, whereas butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activity progressively increases. Both enzymes, which differ in kinetics, substrate specificity, and activity in different brain regions, represent a useful therapeutic target for improving the cholinergic deficit responsible for the decline of cognitive and behavioral characteristics of AD. Additionally, the amyloid peptides, contained in the senile plaques, can induce inflammation in which reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced [

For these reasons, the use of compounds able of restoring the level of acetylcholine through inhibition of the AChE and BChE enzymes, eliminating ROS, and attenuating inflammatory pathways can be a multitarget strategy for the treatment and management of AD [
