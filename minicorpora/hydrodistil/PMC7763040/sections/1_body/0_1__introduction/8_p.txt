0: Several studies reported chemical analyses of its phytochemicals including essential oil, which is acknowledged worldwide because of its beneficial properties.
1: However, it is important to take into account that the relative quantities and the presence and/or absence of some constituents are strongly affected by environmental conditions and agronomic management practices including plant genetic, elevation, topography, harvest time, as well as ecological and climatic conditions.
2: For these reasons, essential oils (EOs) from plants collected in different countries at different seasons comprise different chemical compounds and may exert different biological effects [ 11].
3: Sage EO is used for the treatment of a range of diseases and has been shown to possess cytotoxic [ 12], antimutagenic [ 12], antimicrobial [ 13], antioxidant [ 13], and neuroprotective effects [ 14].
4: The antioxidant activity of aromatic plants has been widely explored and found to have health applications in prevention and reducing risk of diseases such as Alzheimers diseases (AD).
5: This neurodegenerative disorder is the most common form of dementia, often characterized by cognitive decline and memory impairment that can affect behaviour, speech, the motor system, and orientation [ 15].
6: In AD brain, the presence of -amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles is characteristic.
7: During AD progression, different types of neurons deteriorate, although there is a profound loss of forebrain cholinergic neurons, which is accompanied by a progressive decline in acetylcholine [ 16].
