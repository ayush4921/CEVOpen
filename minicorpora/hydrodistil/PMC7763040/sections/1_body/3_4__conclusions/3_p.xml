<p>Herein, we confirmed the in vitro antioxidant and neuroprotective effects of 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> essential oils. The most promising health properties were observed for S2 essential oil in antioxidant tests, while S1 and S3 samples exhibited a significant potential inhibitory activity against AChE and BChE enzymes. Further in vivo studies are needed in order to establish synergism and antagonism effects, route of administration, and dose in order to prospect a potential use of these EOs as new drugs.
