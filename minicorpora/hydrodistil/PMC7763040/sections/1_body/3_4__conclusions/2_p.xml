<p>Both qualitative and quantitative analyses of 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> essential oils revealed that oxygenated monoterpenes are the dominant classes of constituents in which camphor and 1,8 cineole are the most abundant. However, some minor constituents, such as α-bergamotene (S2), β-cubebene (S2), β-farnesene (S1,S3), β-selinene (S1–S3), calarene (S1,S3), germacrene D (S1,S3), manol oxide (S1–S3), and spathulenol (S1,S3), were detected only in Calabrian samples. Moreover, a higher amount of myrcene, γ-muurolene, δ-cadinene, aromadendrene, and terpinolene was found in S2 essential oil with respect to all other samples of 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic>.
