0: AChE and BChE inhibitory properties of  S. officinalis EOs were evaluated by applying the Ellmans method as previously reported [ 45].
1: AChE from  Electrophorus electricus (EC 3.1.1.7, Type VI-S) and BChE from equine serum (EC 3.1.1.8) were used.
2: Acetylthiocholine iodide and butyrylthiocholine iodide were employed as the reaction substrates.
3: Physostigmine was the positive control.
4: The absorbance was read at 405 nm.
