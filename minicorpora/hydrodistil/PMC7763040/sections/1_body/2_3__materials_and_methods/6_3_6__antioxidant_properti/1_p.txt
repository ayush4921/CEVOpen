0: Four in vitro tests, namely, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), ferric-reducing ability power (FRAP), and -carotene bleaching assays, were used to assess the antioxidant effects of  S. officinalis essential oils as previously described [ 61].
1: DPPH and ABTS tests were applied to examine the radicals scavenging effects of sage essential oils.
2: In DPPH assay, samples were tested at different concentrations in the range of 62.51000 g/mL.
3: Absorbance was measured at 517 nm and ascorbic acid was used as positive control.
4: In ABTS assay, samples were analyzed at concentrations ranging from 1 to 400 g/mL.
5: The absorbance was read at 734 nm.
6: Ascorbic acid was used as positive control.
