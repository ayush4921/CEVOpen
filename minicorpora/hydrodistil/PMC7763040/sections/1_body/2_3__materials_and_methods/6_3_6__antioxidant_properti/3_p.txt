0: -Carotene bleaching test was applied to investigate the potential ability of sage EOs to inhibit lipids peroxidation using propyl gallate as a positive control.
1: The antioxidant activity (AA) was calculated using the equation: AA = [(A  A t)/(A*  A t*)]  100 where A and A* are the absorbance values at the time 0 for samples and control, respectively, and A t and A t* are the absorbance values after 30 and 60 min of incubation for samples and control, respectively.
