<p>β-Carotene bleaching test was applied to investigate the potential ability of sage EOs to inhibit lipids peroxidation using propyl gallate as a positive control. The antioxidant activity (AA) was calculated using the equation: AA = [(A − A
 <sub>t</sub>)/(A* − A
 <sub>t</sub>*)] × 100 where A and A* are the absorbance values at the time 0 for samples and control, respectively, and A
 <sub>t</sub> and A
 <sub>t</sub>* are the absorbance values after 30 and 60 min of incubation for samples and control, respectively.
