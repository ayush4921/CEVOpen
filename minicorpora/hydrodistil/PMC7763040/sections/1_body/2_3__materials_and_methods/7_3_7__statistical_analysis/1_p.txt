0: Experiments were carried out in triplicate.
1: Data are reported as means  standard deviation (S.D.).
2: The concentration giving 50% inhibition (IC 50) was calculated by nonlinear regression with the use of Prism GraphPad Prism version 4.0 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).
3: Data were statistically analyzed using one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnetts post hoc test for multiple comparisons with control and Tukeys test to determine any significant difference on chemical parameters.
4: Differences were considered to be significant at  p< 0.05 in the biological tests.
5: Relative Antioxidant Capacity Index (RACI) is an integrated statistical application to evaluate the antioxidant capacity values generated by different tests [ 62].
6: RACI values were calculated using the following equation: RACI = (x  )/, where x is the raw data,  is the mean, and  is the standard deviation.
