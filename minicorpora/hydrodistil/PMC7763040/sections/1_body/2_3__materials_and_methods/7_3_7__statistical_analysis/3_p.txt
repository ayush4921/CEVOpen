0: Literature data on EOs composition of natural populations of  S. officinalis ( Supplementary Materials, Table S1) were collected and organized in a 120 variables (compounds) per 112 cases (plant samples) matrix.
1: Average value () and standard deviation were reported, when opportune.
2: The most representative EO (detected in over 90% of cases) were selected and tested under normality (ShapiroWilk).
3: EOs that did not fit the test ( p< 0.05) were log transformed (Ln (x + 1)) and tested again under normality and, when the test was not fitted, distance from normality was checked; EOs with skewness over 1 were excluded.
4: Variables were standardized (z-score) and principal component analysis (PCA) was performed.
5: The first and the second component were considered and cases were grouped based on the minimal spanning tree (Euclidean distance).
6: EOs were subject to univariate analysis ( t-test and F-test) to check differences in essential oil content among groups; probability test (P) was reported.
7: Statistical analyses were performed using PAST 4.1 software (Copyright Hammer & Harper; free download from:  https://www.nhm.uio.no/english/research/infrastructure/past/).
