0: The chemical composition of  S. officinalis EOs was investigated using a Hewlett-Packard gas chromatograph (Agilent, Milan, Italy) equipped with an HP-5 capillary column (30 m  0.25 mm, 0.25 m), associated with a Hewlett-Packard mass spectrometer (Agilent, Milan, Italy) (GC-MS) using electron impact ionization (EI) carried out at 70 eV as previously reported [ 58].
1: Helium was used as carrier gas.
2: Samples were also analyzed using a Shimadzu GC17A gas chromatograph (GC) (Shimadzu, Milan, Italy) equipped with an ionization flame detector (FID) and an HP-5 capillary column (30 m  0.25 mm, 0.25 m).
3: Nitrogen was used as carrier gas.
4: Sage EOs constituents were tentatively identified by comparing their Retention Indices (RI) either with those in the literature or with those of standards [ 59, 60].
5: RI were calculated under the same operating conditions in relation to a homologous series of  n-alkanes (C 8C 24).
