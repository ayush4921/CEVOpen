<p>The strongest inhibitory ability against BChE was observed for S3 with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 33.13 μg/mL. This activity is 2.1-times higher in comparison to S1. Pearson’s correlation showed that camphor, that showed a higher content in S3 compared to S1, positively correlated with BChE (r = 0.82). The main difference between AChE and BChE is the presence of subregions within the gorge, which includes an acyl-binding pocket and a peripheral anionic site. The differences observed in the acyl-binding site are especially important. Indeed, in AChE the acyl-binding site presented two aromatic amino acids Phe295 and Phe297, which are, respectively, displaced by aliphatic amino acids Leu286 and Val288 in BChE [
