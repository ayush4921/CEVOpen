 <italic>S. lavandulaefolia</italic> EO given orally once daily for 5 days to rats decreased striatal AChE activity at a lower tested dose (20 μL) and striatal and hippocampal AChE activity at a higher tested dose (50 μL); at both doses, there was no change in the AChE activity in the cortex. Temel et al. [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-25-05826" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and Bahadori et al. [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-25-05826" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] demonstrated also the neuroprotective ability of 
 <italic>S. hydrangea</italic>, 
 <italic>S. divaricata</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. nemorosa</italic>. In comparison to 
 <italic>S. divaricata</italic> and 
 <italic>S. nemorosa</italic>, the specie 
 <italic>S. hydrangea</italic> was more efficient against AChE (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 64.68, 434.1, and 40.0, mg/L, respectively).
