<p>EOs from other Salvia species have been intensively investigated as potential source of neuroprotective agents. Kennedy et al. [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-25-05826" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and Temel et al. [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-25-05826" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], indicated that 
 <italic>S. lavandulaefolia</italic> and 
 <italic>S. pseudeuphratica</italic> EOs were highly potent inhibitor of AChE, with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 3 and 26.00 Î¼g/mL, respectively. The inhibitory potency of 
 <italic>S. lavandulaefolia</italic>, collected in different bioclimatic zone in the south-east of Spain, was also investigated by Cutillas et al. [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-25-05826" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. IC
 <sub>50</sub> ranging from 108.0 to 142.4 mg/L were obtained against AChE. An in vivo study carried out by Perry et al. [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-25-05826" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] confirmed this inhibition.
