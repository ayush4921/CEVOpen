<p>Several EO constituents were recently investigated by Nie et al. [
 <xref rid="B56-molecules-25-05826" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] for their potential antioxidant activity. In ABTS test, the following order of activity was found: o-cymene &gt; camphene &gt; α-pinene &gt; camphor &gt; bornyl acetate &gt; α-bisabolene. In DPPH test, the order of activity was: camphor &gt; bornyl acetate &gt; p-cymene &gt; 3-carene &gt; o-cymene &gt; α-pinene &gt; terpinen-4-ol &gt; camphene &gt; linalool oxide acetate &gt; β-pinene &gt; α-bisabolene. Authors speculated that in DPPH test, a carbonyl group and a double bond conjugated to the carbonyl group seem to play an important role in the antioxidant activity. Instead, in ABTS test, the cyclic ether group is important for the founded activity.
