0: On the other hand, hydrodistillation is also widely employed in the extraction of the essential oils from turmeric rhizomes on an industrial scale, due to its low-cost efficiency and easy implementation [ 75].
1: Unfortunately, it may sometimes mean longer extraction times and the production of wastewater, as well as loss and alteration in the composition of essential oils because the raw material is in contact with the boiling water [ 74, 75].
2: Despite this, distillation in the Clevenger apparatus gives better results in the deodorisation process of turmeric relative to other distillation methods, such as distillation using the Kjeldahl apparatus or under high vacuum [ 76].
