0: Ultrasonic extraction is another method of extraction of essential oils and other bioactive compounds [ 77, 95].
1: It is based on ultrasonic cavitation: a bubble implosion produces micro-jets that destroy the lipid glands in the plant cell tissue, releasing the essential oil [ 68].
2: It has overcome low extraction kinetics and yields of SFE-resulting essential oils by enhancing the mass transfer between the plant cell and solvent [ 68, 95].
3: Moreover, it is usually combined with other extraction techniques, enhancing the efficiency and reducing the processing time and costs [ 68, 95] ( Table 1).
