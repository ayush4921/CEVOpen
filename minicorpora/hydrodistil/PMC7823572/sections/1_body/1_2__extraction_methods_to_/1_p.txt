0: The characteristic aroma of turmerics rhizomes is provided mainly by its essential oil, representing an excellent marker of quality of this spice and its derived products.
1: Several extraction processes have been carried out with the subterranean plant stems to obtain this mixture of flavouring compounds, steam distillation being the most commonly chosen one [ 63, 64, 65].
2: In this process, a blast of steam goes through the plant material placed on a perforated plate above, dragging the organic compounds [ 66, 67].
3: It presents certain disadvantages on an industrial scale ( Table 1), including the huge amounts of raw material and time required and, consequently, the high price [ 68].
4: In addition, this process can present difficulties sometimes, either the evaporation of the steam-volatile compounds by the remaining latent heat or the collapse by their excessive elevation in the flask [ 69, 70].
5: With the aim of avoiding these drawbacks and consequently increasing the quality and quantity of the essential oil, this technique has usually been modified and/or combined with others.
6: For instance, Chandra et al.
7: incorporated a continuous water circulation process to the regular steam distillation of the essential oil of turmeric rhizomes and leaves, achieving 13% and 29% more yield, respectively, compared to the conventional process [ 71].
8: Moreover, a subsequent distillation with vacuum allows a more efficient extraction of turmeric monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes [ 72].
9: The addition of a packed bed of turmeric rhizomes above the steam source has been also key to maximize the essential oil yield [ 73].
10: In general, a steam jacket is formed, helping reach a constant elevated temperature of the distillation and avoiding the degradation of the oil and, therefore, the unwanted odours that emerge from it [ 73, 74] ( Table 1).
