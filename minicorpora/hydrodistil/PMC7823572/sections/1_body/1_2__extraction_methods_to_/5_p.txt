0: Among SFE, subcritical water extraction (SWE) also demonstrated many advantages over traditional methods in the recovery of bioactive compounds from plants, excepting implementation on the industrial scale for the moment [ 93].
1: Specifically, it takes advantage of the special properties of supercritical water under high temperature and pressure conditions (100374 C, >50 bar) to extract nonpolar compounds [ 94].
2: After a deep study of the influence of operating conditions in the extraction of  C. longa essential oil from rhizomes (temperature, flow rate, particle size, time, etc.
3: ), SWE has demonstrated its selectivity to enhance a target compound and its suitability as a green and effective method for the extraction of essential oil and curcumin from turmeric rhizome [ 86] ( Table 1).
