 <xref rid="B156-plants-10-00044" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>]. Samples from Nepal included α- and β-turmerones (8.19% and 17.74%, respectively) between other compounds like 
 <italic>epi</italic>-α-patshutene (7.19%), β-sesquiphellandrene (4.99%), 1,4-dimethyl-2-isobutylbenzene (4.4%), (±)-dihydro-ar-turmerone (4.27%) and zingiberene (4.03%) [
 <xref rid="B33-plants-10-00044" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The main components of the essential oil from Nigeria were ar-turmerone, α-turmerone and β-turmerone [

 <xref rid="B157-plants-10-00044" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>], while turmerones (approximately 37%), together with terpinolene (15.8%), zingiberene (11.8%) and β-sesquiphellandrene (8.8%), predominated in the rhizome oil from Reunion Island [
 <xref rid="B134-plants-10-00044" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>]. Turmerones still are also the predominant compounds in samples from Faisalabad (Pakistan) and Turkey [

In the South American continent, the essential oil isolated from rhizomes grown in Ecuador was rich in ar-turmerone (45.5%) and α-turmerone (13.4%), similar to Colombian samples, while that from Brazil was dominated by zingiberene (11%), sesquiphellandrene (10%), β-turmerone (10%) and α-curcumene (5%) [
