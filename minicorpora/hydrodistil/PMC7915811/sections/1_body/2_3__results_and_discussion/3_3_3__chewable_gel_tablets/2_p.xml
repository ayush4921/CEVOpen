<p>When evaluating springiness (parameter which shows elasticity) in the chewable gel tablets with preservatives, it was determined that nutmeg hydrolat had a statistically significant influence on lower springiness for both just made and 28-day-old gel tablets (31.61% and 28.45% lower to compared with G1). After 24 hours, sodium benzoate (Sb) and a sample with ethanolic nutmeg extract (Ee) also had a statistically significantly decreased springiness from 74.09 ± 3.46% (G1) to 52.02 ± 2.69 and 38.30 ± 3.23% (
