<p>To determine the preservatives’ influence on the chewable gel tablets’ texture, a study was prepared where the firmness and springiness of the gel tablets were measured in OR storage conditions. Firmness is a parameter which shows chewable gel tablet’s strength and tightness. In this study it was measured how much strength is needed to compress 50% of gel tablet’s height. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-13-00238-f007">Figure 7</xref> the change of firmness is shown. Chewable gel tablets without glycerol (G0) had a higher firmness—from 426.45 ± 20.03 g to over 6500 g (the analyzer did not measure the correct value). After 24 hours, the firmness of the gel tablets with preservatives was measured and it was determined that aqueous extract of nutmeg (Ae), ethanolic extract of nutmeg (Ee), and nutmeg hydrolat statistically significantly increased the firmness by about 16.64 ± 7.76%, but sodium benzoate (Sb), citric acid (C), nutmeg essential oil (Eo), and essential oil solution (Eos) significantly decreased the firmness by about 24.86 ± 9.90% compared to the G1 sample. To compare the preservatives’ influence on firmness after 28 days, it was determined that the force needed to compress the gel tablets by 50% of H, C, and Ee samples was significantly higher than in the G1 sample (2164.87 ± 249.25 g, 1674.25 ± 125.34 g, and 1556.5 ± 155.46 g vs. 1188.2 ± 128.96 g). Other results did not show a statistically significant change after 28 days (
