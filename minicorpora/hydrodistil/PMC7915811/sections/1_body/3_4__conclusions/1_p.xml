<p>After the production of 10 different formulations of chewable gel tablets, it was found that their shelf-life was influenced not only by the choice of preservative but also by the storage conditions. The chewable gel tablets are most likely to become molded in squeezable bags, and the most suitable tablets for use were stored in tightly closed boxes. When gel tablets were stored in the freezer and then left at room temperature for 30 min, they lost part of water, which is visible next to the tablets; and when stored in an open plastic box they lost part of their weight and hardened. The best way to store gel tablets is in a sealed box.</p>
