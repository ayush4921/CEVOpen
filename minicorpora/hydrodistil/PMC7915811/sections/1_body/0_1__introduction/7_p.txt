1: A microbial contamination can do damage to products (reduce shelf-life, change appearance, color, taste).
2: Pharmaceutical forms (solid, semi-solid or liquid) are prone to microbial spoilage or degradation.
3: Any improper packaging and consumption only increase contamination [ 25].
4: To protect products from contamination it is necessary to use cleaned devices and to follow good manufacturing practice rules [ 26, 27].
