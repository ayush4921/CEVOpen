<p>Chewable gel tablets with a natural preservative (such as 
 <italic>Myristica fragrans</italic>) are an innovative pharmaceutical form which can be used as a food supplement or a medical device, and it can have less sugar or sweetness because the natural preservative can prolong shelf-life of gel tablets and it can also substitute the chemical preservative. Nowadays there is a trend of “less sugar” or “natural products”, “from nature/together with nature”, so natural plant as a preservative is a novelty, moreover, it also has some pharmacological effects (antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial), and it is a new area in the manufacture and texture analysis of property differences of chewable gel tablets.
