0: The precision was evaluated using repeatability (intraday) and intermediate precision (interday).
1: Intraday and interday variations were established using six independent replicates of the standard reference of each compound on one and two different days, to determine intraday and interday precision, respectively.
2: In order to study the accuracy of the method, recovery experiments were performed.
3: The samples were spiked with known amounts of the standards, at different concentrations levels (low, medium and high):  1 (5, 50 and 150 g/mL),  3 (20, 100 and 200 g/mL) and  4 (13.3, 66.8 and 133.4 g/mL).
4: The average recoveries were calculated according to the following formula: (3)Recovery (%) = amount found  original amountamount spiked  100
