0: The HPLC method was validated according to the International Conference on Harmonization Guidelines (ICH, 2005) and included a determination of selectivity, linearity, precision, accuracy, LOD, and LOQ.
1: The linearity of the system was performed through the calibration curves of the standards ( 1,  3, and  4); compounds were accurately weighed (5 mg) and dissolved in 5 mL acetonitrile-water (5 mL, 1:5) to prepare stock solutions at a final concentration of 1 mg/mL.
2: The solutions of the calibration curve were obtained by diluting the stock solution in water, ranging from 5150 g/mL for  1, 20200 g/mL for  3 and 13.3133.4 g/mL for  4.
3: The linearity was assessed estimating the slope, y-intercept, and the determination coefficient ( R2) using the least-squares analysis.
4: LOD and LOQ were determined based on the standard deviation () of the response and the slope (S) from calibration curve constructed with a series of appropriate concentrations for determination of the limits, using the following equations:  (1)LOD=3.3 S(2)LOQ=10 S
