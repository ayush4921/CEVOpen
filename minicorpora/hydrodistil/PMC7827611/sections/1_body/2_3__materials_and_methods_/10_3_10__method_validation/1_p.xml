<p>The HPLC method was validated according to the International Conference on Harmonization Guidelines (ICH, 2005) and included a determination of selectivity, linearity, precision, accuracy, LOD, and LOQ. The linearity of the system was performed through the calibration curves of the standards (
 <bold>1</bold>, 
 <bold>3</bold>, and 
 <bold>4</bold>); compounds were accurately weighed (5 mg) and dissolved in 5 mL acetonitrile-water (5 mL, 1:5) to prepare stock solutions at a final concentration of 1 mg/mL. The solutions of the calibration curve were obtained by diluting the stock solution in water, ranging from 5−150 μg/mL for 
 <bold>1</bold>, 20−200 μg/mL for 
 <bold>3</bold> and 13.3−133.4 μg/mL for 
 <bold>4</bold>. The linearity was assessed estimating the slope, y-intercept, and the determination coefficient (
