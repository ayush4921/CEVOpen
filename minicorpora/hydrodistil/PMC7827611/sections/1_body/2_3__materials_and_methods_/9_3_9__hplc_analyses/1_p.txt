0: All experiments were performed on a Waters HPLC system equipped with a quaternary pump (model 600), photodiode array detector (PDA, model 996), manual injector and an XBridgeTM BEH Shield RP18 column, (130 A, 5 m, 4.6 mm  250 mm, Waters) at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min.
1: The mobile phase consisted of (A) acetonitrile and (B) water (0.1% formic acid) the following gradient elution program was used: 2040% A for 010 min, 40100% A for 1023 min, 100% A for 2324 min, and 10020% A for 2428 min, 20% A for 2830 min, the injection volume was 20 L. The UV detector was set at a monitoring wavelength of 327 nm.
2: System control, data collection, and data processing were accomplished using Waters Empower 2 chromatography software.
