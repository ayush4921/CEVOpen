0: The ethyl acetate fraction (9.5 g) was subjected to column chromatography on Sephadex LH-20, eluting with methanol; 28 (16 mL each) fractions were obtained (F 1F 28).
1: Secondary fraction F 20 was dissolved in MeOH; from this solution precipitated 85 mg of apigenin ( 6).
2: Column chromatography on Sephadex LH-20 of F 16 (1.20 g), eluting with acetoneMeOH (9:1), rendered 24 fractions (8 mL each): F 16-1F 16-24.
3: Fractions F 16-5, F 16-10, and F 16-13 yielded 14 mg of  3, 8 mg of  5 and 5 mg of  4, respectively.
4: Fraction F 17 (50 mg) was subjected to column chromatography on silica gel (50 g), eluting with a gradient of hexaneEtOAc (9:10:10) and EtOAcMeOH (10:00:10), 12 fractions of 300 mL each were obtained.
5: From F 17-5, eluted with hexaneEtOAc (7:3), 9 mg of  7 were obtained.
6: From F 17-6, eluted with hexaneEtOAc (6:4), crystalized 8 mg of  8.
7: Compounds  1 and  2 were identified by comparison with authentic standards (TLC, HPLC, NMR).
