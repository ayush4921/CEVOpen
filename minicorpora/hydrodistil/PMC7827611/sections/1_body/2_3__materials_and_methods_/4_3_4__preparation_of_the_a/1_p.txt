0: Air-dried aerial parts (leaves and stem) of  B. heterophylla (5 g) were extracted with 250 mL of boiling water for 30 min.
1: The resulting infusion was filtrated and concentrated in vacuo to yield 1.28 g of dry aqueous extract (EA).
2: On the order hand, the infusion was exhaustively partitioned with EtOAc (250 mL  3); the combined organic fractions were dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated in vacuo to yield 0.116 g of dry ethyl acetate fraction.
3: This process was repeated as much as needed to obtain 10 g of this fraction.
