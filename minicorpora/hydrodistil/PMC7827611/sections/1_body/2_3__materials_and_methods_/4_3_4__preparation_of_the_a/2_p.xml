<p>Essential oil (EO) was prepared by hydrodistillation (3 h), with 200 g of fresh aerial parts and 1.3 L of distilled water, using a Clevenger-type instrument. The hydrodistilled mixture was extracted with dichloromethane (250 mL × 3); the combined organic phases were dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated in vacuo. This procedure was performed in triplicate and the resulting oils (320 mg) were stored at −4 °C until chemical analysis and pharmacological experiments.</p>
