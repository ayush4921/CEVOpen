0: All analyses by GC-MS were carried out in an Agilent 6890 N (Agilent Technology, Santa Clara, CA, USA) series gas chromatograph equipped with a LECO Pegasus 4D time-of-flight mass spectrometer detector (IET International Equipment Trading Ltd., Mundelein, IL, USA).
1: A capillary column DB-5 was used [(5%-phenyl)-methylpolysiloxane, 20 m  0.18 mm I.D.
2: ; 0.18 m film thickness].
3: The oven temperature was set at 40 C for three minutes, then at 40 to 300 C at 20 C/min and held isothermally at 300 C for 15 min.
4: Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 mL/min.
5: Compounds were identified using index retention method ( I  R), by co-injection of the sample with a solution containing the homologous series of  n-alkanes (C 8C 27), and by comparison of their MS fragmentation patterns with those of compounds contained in the spectral database of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, Gaithersburg, MD, USA).
6: All determinations were performed in triplicate.
