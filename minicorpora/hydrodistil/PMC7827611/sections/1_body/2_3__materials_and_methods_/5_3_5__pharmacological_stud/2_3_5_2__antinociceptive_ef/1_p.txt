0: The antinociceptive effect of AE and EO was assessed using the formalin test [ 38].
1: All the samples were diluted in the vehicle and animals were divided into groups ( n = 6).
2: Mice were treated with AE (31.6316 mg/kg, p.o.
3: ), EO (30170 g/paw, i.pl.
4: ), diclofenac (positive control, 50 mg/kg, p.o.
5: and 100 g/paw, i.pl.)
6: or with vehicle (0.5% Tween 80 in 0.9% saline solution).
7: After 30 min, each animal was received 30 L of diluted 2% formalin in into the mice dorsal surface of the right hind paw.
8: The biphasic response (licking of the injected paw) induced by the formalin solution was quantified every 5 min during a 30 min period [ 13].
9: The doses were logarithmic, and were selected on the basis of previous experimental design for traditional preparations [ 38].
