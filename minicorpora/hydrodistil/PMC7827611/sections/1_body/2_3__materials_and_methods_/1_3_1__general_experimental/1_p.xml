<p>Melting points were determined on a Fisher-Johns apparatus (Thermo Scientific, Vernon Hills, IL, USA) and are uncorrected. NMR spectra were recorded in a Unity Plus 400 spectrometer (Varian, Palo Alto, CA, USA), at either 400 MHz (
 <sup>1</sup>H) or 100 (
 <sup>13</sup>C) MHz, in DMSO-

 <sup>Â®</sup>Class system (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) equipped with a quaternary pump, sample manager, column oven and photodiode array detector (PDA) interfaced with an SQD2 single mass spectrometer detector with an electrospray ion source. IR spectra were recorded using a Spectrum RXI FTIR (Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). Open column chromatography was carried out on Sephadex LH-20 (GE Healthcare, Urbandale, IA, USA) and silica gel 60, 70-230 mesh (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany).
