0: Melting points were determined on a Fisher-Johns apparatus (Thermo Scientific, Vernon Hills, IL, USA) and are uncorrected.
1: NMR spectra were recorded in a Unity Plus 400 spectrometer (Varian, Palo Alto, CA, USA), at either 400 MHz ( 1H) or 100 ( 13C) MHz, in DMSO- d6 and MeOH- d4.
2: Data processing was carried out with the software MestReNova version 12.0.0.
3: Mass spectra of the isolates were obtained on an Acquity UHPLC-H Acquity UHPLC-H Class system (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) equipped with a quaternary pump, sample manager, column oven and photodiode array detector (PDA) interfaced with an SQD2 single mass spectrometer detector with an electrospray ion source.
4: IR spectra were recorded using a Spectrum RXI FTIR (Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA).
5: Open column chromatography was carried out on Sephadex LH-20 (GE Healthcare, Urbandale, IA, USA) and silica gel 60, 70-230 mesh (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany).
