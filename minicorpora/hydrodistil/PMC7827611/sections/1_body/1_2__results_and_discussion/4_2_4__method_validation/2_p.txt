0: The methods selectivity was determined by comparing the chromatographic profile of AE with the data obtained for the standards, considering the retention time and UV spectra ( Figures S4S6, Supplementary Materials).
1: The linearity was tested by analyzing a series of different concentration ranges: 5 to 150 g/mL for  1, 20 to 200 g/mL for  3, and 13.4 to 133.4 g/mL for  4.
2: In all cases, the value of the determination coefficient ( R2) was greater than 0.99.
3: The limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) values were 0.5 g/mL and 1.5 g/mL for compound  1, 2.2 g/mL and 6.6 for compound  3 and 1.4 g/mL and 4.1 g/mL for compound  4.
4: The intraday and interday precision RSDs were no more than 2% while the repeatability variation was no more than 2% ( Table 2).
5: Percentage recoveries of the standards are also indicated in  Table 2; in each case, a good accuracy was obtained in the range from 99.15% to 100.83% (RSD  2.0%).
6: Altogether the described previous data revealed that the method was linear, precise and accurate in the range of concentrations evaluated.
