0: In the present study, chlorogenic and di-caffeoylquinic acids were selected as markers for the quantitative analysis of  B. heterophylla.
1: The optimal chromatographic separation was achieved with a Waters HPLC equipped with an XBridge BEH Shield RP18 column and a mixture of water containing 0.1% formic acid and acetonitrile as mobile phase, which was chosen after several trials; the PDA detection wavelength () was set at 327 nm; under these optimized conditions, an effective resolution was achieved for compounds  1 4.
2: Compounds  1 4 were identified by their retention time and coelution with AE; a representative chromatogram of the AE of  B. heterophylla (BH-1) is shown in  Figure 4.
3: The developed method was validated using compounds  1,  3 and  4 according to the International Conference on Harmonization guideline (ICH) [ 37], and was successfully applied to determine the content of caffeoylquinic acids in AE prepared from different batches of the plant.
4: The overall results are summarized in  Table 2 and  Table 3.
