<p>The method’s selectivity was determined by comparing the chromatographic profile of AE with the data obtained for the standards, considering the retention time and UV spectra (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-10-00116">Figures S4–S6, Supplementary Materials</xref>). The linearity was tested by analyzing a series of different concentration ranges: 5 to 150 μg/mL for 
 <bold>1</bold>, 20 to 200 μg/mL for 
 <bold>3</bold>, and 13.4 to 133.4 μg/mL for 
 <bold>4</bold>. In all cases, the value of the determination coefficient (

 <sup>2</sup>) was greater than 0.99. The limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) values were 0.5 µg/mL and 1.5 µg/mL for compound 
 <bold>1</bold>, 2.2 µg/mL and 6.6 for compound 
 <bold>3</bold> and 1.4 µg/mL and 4.1 µg/mL for compound 
 <bold>4</bold>. The intraday and interday precision RSDs were no more than 2% while the repeatability variation was no more than 2% (

 <xref rid="plants-10-00116-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>; in each case, a good accuracy was obtained in the range from 99.15% to 100.83% (RSD ≤ 2.0%). Altogether the described previous data revealed that the method was linear, precise and accurate in the range of concentrations evaluated.
