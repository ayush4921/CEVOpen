<p>The volatile components profile of 
 <italic>B. heterophylla</italic> was gathered by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses of EO obtained by hydrodistillation and head space-solid phase microextraction (HSâ€“SPME)-adsorbed compounds. The HS-SPME is a more efficient, quicker, and free-solvent method for analyzing volatile constituents from plants and other matrices [
