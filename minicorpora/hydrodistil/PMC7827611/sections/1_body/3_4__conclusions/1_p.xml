<p>In summary, the aerial parts of 
 <italic>B. heterophylla</italic> exhibited antinociceptive activity when tested by the formalin assay. The main classes of compounds characterized in the traditional preparation were chlorogenic acid derivatives and flavonoids with known antinociceptive properties. In the case of the essential oil, the activity could be attributed to its high content of antinociceptive monoterpenes. In any case, the pharmacological effects might be achieved via pharmacology synergism and/or polypharmacology. A precise, reliable, and accurate HPLC method for quantifying chlorogenic acid derivativesâ€™ content in the infusion of the plant was developed and validated. This methodology will be useful for preparing standardized infusions or other formulations made up of this species. This method will also be proposed as composition test for the monograph of 
 <italic>B. heterophylla</italic> to be included in the new edition of the Mexican Herbal Pharmacopoeia. Altogether, our results tend to support the medicinal use of 
 <italic>B. heterophylla</italic> to treat painful complaints in Mexican folk medicine and contribute to the rational use of this valuable medicinal plant.
