<p>The potential anti-inflammatory activity of 
 <italic>L. luisieri</italic>, 
 <italic>F. vulgare</italic> and 
 <italic>T. capitata</italic> EOs has been previously reported using different in vitro and in vivo models (
 <xref rid="plants-10-00050-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), but as far as we know, the anti-inflammatory potential of 
 <italic>D. ambrosioides</italic> EO has not been addressed to date. Recently, the anti-inflammatory activity of alcoholic or hydroalcoholic extracts of 
 <italic>D. ambrosioides</italic> was reported as showing the ability to reduce interleukin 6 (IL-6), myeloperoxidase (MPO), nitric oxide (NO) and adenosine-deaminase (ADA) activity and TNF-Î± and, therefore, they are potentially useful in wound healing and in the treatment of arthritic processes [
