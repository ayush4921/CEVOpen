<p>Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> 0111:B4 (Sigma), added at 200 ng/mL, was employed as the inflammatory stimulus. The plate was incubated at 37°C overnight. After this period, the plate was centrifuged (1800 g, 5 min, 16°C), the supernatant collected and TNF-α release measured using the cytokine-specific sandwich quantitative ELISA according to the manufacturer’s instructions (TNF-α duo set, DY210, R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). CCL2 release was measured using the cytokine-specific sandwich quantitative ELISA according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Human CCL2/MCP-1 duo set, DY279, R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). Dexamethasone was employed as positive control (0.3 μM). The statistical significance of differences was calculated employing the software GraphPad Prism, version 5.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), using ordinary one-way ANOVA/Newman–Keuls multiple comparison test. All the experiments were performed in triplicate.
