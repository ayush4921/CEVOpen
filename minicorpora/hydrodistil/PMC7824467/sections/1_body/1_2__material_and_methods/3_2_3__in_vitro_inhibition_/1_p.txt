0: This assay was performed according to Campana et al.
1: [ 60].
2: Briefly, THP-1 cells (ATCC TIB-202) were cultivated in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 0.05 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 g/mL gentamicin at 37C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO 2.
3: The medium was renewed twice a week when the cell concentration reached 1.0  10 6 cells/mL.
4: The cells were transferred to a 96-well microplate at a concentration of 100,000 cells per well and incubated for 18 h with RPMI supplemented with 1% FBS to initiate serum starvation, which was kept throughout the experiment.
