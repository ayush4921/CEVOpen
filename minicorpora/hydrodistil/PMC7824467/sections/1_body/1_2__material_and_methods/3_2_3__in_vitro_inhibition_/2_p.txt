0: The cells were pre-treated with EOs at three concentrations for 3 h. To determine each EO working concentration, the toxicity of the EOs on THP-1 cells was accessed by measuring cell viability using a 3(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) method and untreated cells as the reference for viability [ 61].
1: EOs were considered nontoxic for the THP-1 cell line, and adequate for further analysis, when cell viability was higher than 90%.
2: The EO concentrations ranged from 3 g/mL to 90 g/mL ( Dysphania ambrosioides,  Eucalyptus globulus,  E. radiata,  E. viminalis,  Foeniculum vulgare,  Lavandula stoechas,  Mentha cervina,  Origanum majorana,  Pinus pinaster,  Solidago virgaurea, Thymus mastichina,  Th.
3: pulegioides ( Thymus abbreviated to  Th., to avoid confusion with  T. from  Thymbra),  Th.
4: vulgaris), from 3 g/mL to 30 g/mL ( Brachylaena huillensis,  Satureja montana,  Spirostachys africanus,  Th.
5: zygis) and from 5 g/mL to 90 g/mL ( Thymbra capitata) ( Table 4).
