0: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from  Escherichia coli 0111:B4 (Sigma), added at 200 ng/mL, was employed as the inflammatory stimulus.
1: The plate was incubated at 37C overnight.
2: After this period, the plate was centrifuged (1800 g, 5 min, 16C), the supernatant collected and TNF- release measured using the cytokine-specific sandwich quantitative ELISA according to the manufacturers instructions (TNF- duo set, DY210, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA).
3: CCL2 release was measured using the cytokine-specific sandwich quantitative ELISA according to the manufacturers instructions (Human CCL2/MCP-1 duo set, DY279, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA).
4: Dexamethasone was employed as positive control (0.3 M).
5: The statistical significance of differences was calculated employing the software GraphPad Prism, version 5.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), using ordinary one-way ANOVA/NewmanKeuls multiple comparison test.
6: All the experiments were performed in triplicate.
