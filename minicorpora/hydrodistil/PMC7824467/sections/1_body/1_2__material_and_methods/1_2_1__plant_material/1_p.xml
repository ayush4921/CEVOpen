<p>Collective and/or individual samples, from cultivated and wild-growing medicinal and aromatic plants, were collected from mainland Portugal (
 <xref rid="plants-10-00050-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). As a rule, the plant material was collected during the local producers’ harvesting season. For herbaceous species, this was usually at the flowering phase, whereas for trees, it was at landscaping time. If not immediately extracted, the plant material was stored at −20 °C until essential oil (EO) isolation. Dried aerial parts from commercially available products sold in local herbal shops were also analyzed, as well as the essential oils isolated from oleoresin, in the case of 
 <italic>Pinus pinaster</italic>, and from the two species from Angola (
 <xref rid="plants-10-00050-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). A total of twenty essential oils isolated from eighteen species from the Amaranthaceae, Apiaceae, Asteraceae, Euphorbiaceae, Lamiaceae, Myrtaceae and Pinaceae families were tested. A voucher specimen of each plant species, collected from the wild state condition, was deposited in the Herbarium of the Botanical Garden of Lisbon University, Lisbon, Portugal. For commercial plant material, a reference sample from each plant is retained at the CBV laboratory and is available upon request.
