0: The GCMS unit consisted of a Perkin Elmer Clarus 600 gas chromatograph, equipped with a DB1 fused-silica column (30 m  0.25 mm i.d., film thickness 0.25 m; J & W Scientific, Inc.), and interfaced with a Perkin Elmer 600T mass spectrometer (software version 5.4.2.1617, Perkin Elmer, Shelton, CT, USA).
1: Injector and oven temperatures were as above; transfer line temperature, 280 C; ion source temperature, 220 C; the carrier gas, helium, was adjusted to a linear velocity of 30 cm/s; split ratio, 1:40; ionization energy, 70 eV; scan range, 40300 u; scan time, 1 s. The identity of the components was assigned by comparison of their retention indices, relative to  nalkane indices and GCMS spectra from a labmade library, created with reference essential oils, laboratory-synthesized components, laboratory-isolated compounds and commercially available standards.
