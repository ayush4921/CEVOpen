0: Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses were carried out using a Trace GC Ultra gas chromatograph and a DSQ II mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron Corporation, Beverly, MA, USA) with an Rtx-1 column (length 60 m, internal diameter 0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 mm, Restek Corporation, Bellefonte, PA, USA).
1: A flow divider (an MS-Column Flow Splitter, SGE Analytical Science, Melrose Park, Australia) collected of signals concurrently from two detectors (FID, MSD, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).
2: The split ratio was 1:20.
3: The temperature program was from 50 C (3 min) to 300 C (30 min), at a gradient of 48 C (21 min).
4: The temperature of the injector (SSL) and detector (FID) was 280 C and 300 C, respectively.
5: The helium flowing at a constant pressure of 200 kPa was used as the carrier gas.
6: The mass spectrometer ionization energy was 70 eV, and the ion source temperature was 200 C. A full scan was conducted in the mass range from 33 to 420.
7: The analysis was repeated three times.
8: The NIST Library, Wiley 8th edition, and the Adams 4th edition were used.
