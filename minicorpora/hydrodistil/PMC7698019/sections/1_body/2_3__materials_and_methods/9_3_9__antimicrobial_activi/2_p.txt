0: Antimicrobial activity assay was carried out using an impedimetric method (Bactometer M64, bioMerieux, Craponne, France).
1: The celery seed essential oil was diluted in ethyl alcohol (pure P.A., Avantor Performance Materials Polan, Gliwice, Poland) in a ratio of 1:1.
2: Each sample included 0.1 mL of the standardized microorganism inoculum and the essential oil at the examined concentration within the range from 50 to 500 g/mL.
3: Next, each Bactometer well was filled until a final volume of 1 mL was obtained with the use of the growth medium: general purpose medium (GPM, bioMerieux, Craponne, France) for  B. subtilis, S. aureus, and  P. aeruginosa, coliform medium (CM, bioMerieux, Craponne, France) for  E. coli, and yeast and mould medium (YMM, bioMerieux, Craponne, France) for  A. niger, P. expansum, and  C. vini.
4: In the negative controls, instead of the essential oil, 0.5 g/mL of novobiocin for bacteria or 0.2 g/mL of cycloheximide for yeast and moulds were added.
5: Positive controls did not contain essential oil, but only 0.1 mL of cell standardized suspension in 0.9 mL of the appropriate medium.
6: The microorganisms were incubated for 72 h at their optimal growth temperatures (30 C for  E. coli,  B. subtilis, 37 C for  S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and 25 C for fungi).
7: Next, the tested strains were checked for their viability by streaking on the PCA medium.
8: Plates were incubated for 72 h for bacteria and 120 h for fungi at the optimal growth temperatures.
9: The results which were the mean value of three measurements were presented as MIC and MBC.
