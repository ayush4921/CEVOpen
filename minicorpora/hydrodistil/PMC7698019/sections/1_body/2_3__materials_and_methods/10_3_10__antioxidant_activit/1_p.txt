0: Radical scavenging activity was examined using the DPPH assay.
1: First, the 1-M DPPH (Sigma-Aldrich, Hamburg, Germany) solution in methanol (pure p.a., Chempur, Poland) was prepared.
2: Next, the 200 L of DPPH was added to 100 L of the solution of essential oil in methanol at concentrations of 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 g/L, respectively.
3: The analysis was performed using a 96-well polystyrene plate (Nest Biotechnology, Wuxi, China).
4: The samples were incubated in the dark at room temperature for 30 min.
5: As the reference, a methanol solution of Trolox (()-6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchromane-2-carboxylic acid, Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA) was used.
6: The absorbance of the DPPH radical was spectrophotometrically analyzed at a wavelength of 517 nm (Modular Multimode Microplate Reader TriStar 2 S, Berthold Technologies, Oak Ridge, TN, USA).
7: The results were shown as the percentage of inhibition of the DPPH radicals calculated according to the formula:  = (A0A1)A0100, where, A 0 is the absorbance of the control sample (DPPH), and A 1 is the absorbance of the sample with the essential oil.
8: The results were expressed as the arithmetic mean value of the three consecutive measurements with a standard deviation value.
