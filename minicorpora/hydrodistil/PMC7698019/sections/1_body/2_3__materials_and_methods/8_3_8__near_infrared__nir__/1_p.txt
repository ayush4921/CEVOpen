0: Oil samples were scanned in the infrared spectrometer Nicolet iS50 FT-IR (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) that allows to generate spectra in two ranges: MIR and NIR.
1: MIR analyses were carried out with a DTGS KBr detector, IR light source, and KBr beamsplitter.
2: The range of scans was from 4000 to 400 cm 1 with a resolution of 4.00 cm 1.
3: The samples were placed in IR Sample Cards (Real Crystal, US) with KBr glass (9.5 mm aperture) and all spectra were accumulated from 32 scans.
4: During NIR measurements there were used: InGaAs detector, white light, and CaF 2 beamsplitter.
5: The range of scans was from 12,0004400 cm 1 with a resolution of 8.00 cm 1.
6: All spectra were accumulated from 32 scans.
7: The samples were placed in the middle of the borosilicate glass tubes (6  50 mm) made by Kimble Glass, US.
8: All calculations were made using a commercial analysis software: OMNIC 9.3.30 and TQ Analyst, v. 9.4.45 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).
