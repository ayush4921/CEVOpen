0: The extraction of essential oils was performed by the hydrodistillation process with the use of a modified Deryng apparatus [ 29].
1: The 1000 mL of distilled water per 100 g of celery seeds was used.
2: The control sample constituted the essential oil from untreated celery seeds (without ultrasound processes).
3: The yield of essential oil was calculated as an average of three hydrodistillation processes.
4: The percentage increase of yield of essential oil was calculated according to the formula:  YUAHYHDYHD100%, where:  Y  UAH means the yield of essential oil obtained by ultrasound-assisted hydrodistillation, and  Y  HD means the yield of essential oil obtained by hydrodistillation.
