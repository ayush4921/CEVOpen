0: The experiment has been planned according to a DOE approach with the use of the Taguchi method.
1: The selected control factors and their applicable working levels were: time of sonication 5, 20, 50 min; pulse range 0.1, 0.5, 1.0; power control 20, 60,100 %, as well as the content of water 350, 700, 950 mL.
2: The content of water shall mean the water in the sample treated with ultrasounds.
3: The pulse range was: setting 1 meaning continuously switched on, setting 0.6 meaning power discharge 0.6 s, and pause 0.4 s. In this research, the L9 orthogonal array was used, which has nine rows corresponding to the number of tests, with four columns at three levels.
4: Each level of each parameter has been tested three times, which means that the number of required experiments for this module was 27.
5: In the case of the DOE approach, randomness is desired and should be maintained when possible.
6: In relation to this rule, all the trials and repetitions were unbiased and performed in a completely randomized order.
7: Next, the ANOVA was performed (using the Statistica 13.1 software).
8: The Taguchis loss function the larger the better was adopted as the best possible loss function for maximizing product yield.
9: In the case of this function, the best quality standard is infinity, and the higher the actual value (the yield of the essential oil), the better.
10: Based on the analysis of Eta values, the best sets of input parameters have been determined and the optimal parameters of the optimized process have been chosen.
11: Last, run confirmation test with optimum conditions have been done in triple repetition.
12: The essential oil obtained from seeds sonicated in optimal conditions was used for further research as the study sample.
