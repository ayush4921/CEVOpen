<p>The experimental part of this research was performed with the use of the dried celery seeds (
 <italic>Apium graveolens</italic> L.) that showed no germination power and were industrial waste with no utility and economic value. Raw material was donated by the manufacturer as part of a cooperation with the Polish seeds company Przedsiębiorstwo Hodowlano-Nasienne W. Legutko Sp. z o.o (Jutrosin). A voucher specimen is stocked in the manufacturer’s premises (Jutrosin, Poland).
