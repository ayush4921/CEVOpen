<p>To maximize the process efficiency, the experiment was planned according to a design of experiment (DOE) approach with the use of the Taguchi method to optimize parameters of the seeds sonication process for savings in time and energy consumption. The qualitative and quantitative composition, physicochemical parameters, biological activity, and aroma profile of the essential oil obtained from raw material sonicated in optimal parameters were analyzed.</p>
