0: The objective of this study was to improve the yield of the essential oil extraction using distillation assisted by sonication of raw material.
1: There is no information in the literature about the effect of sonication of celery seeds ( Apium graveolens L.,  Apiaceae Lindl.)
2: on the hydrodistillation of essential oil as well as the obtained product quality.
3: The only research on ultrasound-assisted extraction was conducted by Zor et al.
4: (2017), which was proved as a fast and efficient method for deriving alcoholic extracts from celery seeds, a rich source of antioxidants [ 4].
5: The celery and its essential oil are known for their therapeutic, medical, and industrial attributes [ 5].
6: Due to antioxidant activities and antimicrobial effects against bacteria, yeast, and moulds, the celery seed oil may be used as alternative natural food preservatives, functional foods, and nutraceutical ingredient [ 6].
7: The presented research places special emphasis on environmental action, so the waste celery seeds which did not meet quality criteria and without any sowing value were used.
