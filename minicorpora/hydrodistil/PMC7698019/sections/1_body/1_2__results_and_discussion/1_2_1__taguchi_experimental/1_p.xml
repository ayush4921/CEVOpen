<p>The results of the Taguchi optimization process are illustrated in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05322-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. At individual applicable working levels, the yield of essential oil was from 1.456 ± 0.011 to 1.978 ± 0.048 g per 100 g of seeds. It was shown that, the higher the Eta value, the higher the efficiency. This is consistent with the assumptions of Taguchi’s loss function the larger the better. According to the analysis of variance (ANOVA), all optimized parameters have a statistically significant effect on the yield of essential oil (
