 <caption> Effects on the viability of cancer cellsHepG2 and HCT116 as a function of LPEO concentration. Significant decreases in cell viability of cancer cells are seen at increasing LPEO concentrations compared to untreated controls (control group was set to 100%). **—Very significant at p &lt; 0.01, ***—Highly significant at p &lt; 0.001. </caption>
