<p>Most grapefruit EO samples used for bioactivity studies were made by cold-pressing, steam distillation, or hydrodistillation methods. Cold-pressing is the predominant method to extract most citrus peel EOs, including grapefruit EOs. In commercial practice, grapefruitis processed to obtain juice and other by-products. EO is one of the primary grapefruit by-products. Large-scale grapefruit EO is mainly prepared by a cold-pressing method based on John Bean FoodTech (JBT) juice extractors and its technology, which is used by 75% of the world’s citrus juice production [

The EO was extracted by mechanical rupturing of the oil sacs in the flavedo, expressing the oil as an aqueous emulsion from which it is separated by centrifuging. The EO recovery is a physical separation process and no heat is applied throughout the whole extraction procedure. The operation temperature is much lower than in the distillation procedure. Thus, the EOs will have characteristics that are closer to those of the essence present in the grapefruit matrix. Large scale production, low cost and the aroma characteristic remaining are the big advantages of the cold-pressing method. However, cold-pressed grapefruit oil contains waxes, pesticide residues, coumarins, carotenoids and other nonvolatile components [

 <xref rid="B30-molecules-25-00217" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], some of them also have good bioactivities that may cause bias in bioactivity research of EO. César et al. (2009) found that furanocoumarins isolated from grapefruit peel oil showed potent in vitro inhibitory activity against intestinal cytochrome P450 3A4, an enzyme involved in “grapefruit/drug” interactions in humans [

 <xref rid="B31-molecules-25-00217" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. To avoid such problems, and find a new way to use the commercial available cold-pressed grapefruit EO in biochemistry and pharmachutical fields, we used a molecular distillation method to prepare grapefruit oil samples for our bioactivity tests.
