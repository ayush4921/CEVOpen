0: Molecular distillation is a special liquidliquid separation technology under high vacuum, which is employed as a separation process in the food industry [ 32, 33].
1: Molecular distillation can divide the EO mixture into two different phases according to the free path of different molecules at low temperature.
2: Molecular distillation is prominent with the advantages of low temperature treatment and high vacuum application, which is very suitable for thermolabile compounds and is used for concentrating and refining EOs [ 34, 35].
3: At present, there are seldom reports on the antibacterial and anticancer activity of Eos obtained by molecular distillation.
4: In this study, the cold-pressed grapefruit EO was processed by molecular distillation technology and the light phase essential oil (LPEO) was collected.
5: Its constituents were identified by GC-MS.
6: The activities of LEPO were tested on microorganisms and malignant proliferating cells (HCT116 colon cancer cells and HepG2 liver cancer cells) were tested.
7: We expect that this work can stimulate the development of new agents for food preservation and chemo-preventive anti-cancer treatments.
