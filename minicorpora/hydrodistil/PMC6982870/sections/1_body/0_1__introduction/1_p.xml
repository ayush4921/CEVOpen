<p>With the frequent occurrence of food safety issues and the toxicity of synthetic chemicals, the demand for safe and natural alternatives is growing. Plant extracts have been used since ancient times, and now the focus is on their role in health promotion and their treatment and prevention properties for various diseases. In the past few decades, plant essential oils (EOs) have attracted a lot of interest due to their safety and pharmacological properties including bacteriostatic, free radical scavenging, anti-inflammatory, and inhibitory effects on malignant tumor cell proliferation [

 <xref rid="B9-molecules-25-00217" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], is famous for its taste and nutritional value. Grapefruit EO is extracted from grapefruit peel and has been used for a long time as a valuable ingredient for its characteristic aroma in flavor and fragrance [

 <xref rid="B11-molecules-25-00217" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Similar to most citrus EOs, its major components are terpenes and terpene oxides. Terpene oxides include alcohols, ethers, aldehydes, ketones, and esters [

 <xref rid="B14-molecules-25-00217" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], which are the main source of the aroma, whereas terpenes contribute less to the aroma. In spite of extensive studies on the aroma features of grapefruit EO, in recent years, more and more researchers have become interested in exploring their biological and pharmacological activities. Grapefruit EO has been reported to have a wide range of bioactivities. It was shown to inhibit the growth of food-borne spoilage bacteria and pathogenic strains [

 <xref rid="B17-molecules-25-00217" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Okunowo et al. (2013) found that grapefruit EO obtained from the peel by hydrodistillation exerted inhibitory effects against bacteria and fungi, andmay be further developed for the treatment of certain diseases [
