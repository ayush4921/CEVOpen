0: With the frequent occurrence of food safety issues and the toxicity of synthetic chemicals, the demand for safe and natural alternatives is growing.
1: Plant extracts have been used since ancient times, and now the focus is on their role in health promotion and their treatment and prevention properties for various diseases.
2: In the past few decades, plant essential oils (EOs) have attracted a lot of interest due to their safety and pharmacological properties including bacteriostatic, free radical scavenging, anti-inflammatory, and inhibitory effects on malignant tumor cell proliferation [ 1, 2, 3, 4].
3: Citrus Eos are the main aromatic by-products of the juice extraction industry and are widely used in food, cosmetics and pharmaceutical industry [ 5, 6, 7].
4: The annual global production of citrus EO is approximately 16,000 tons, and the cost is about $14,000/ton on the international market.
5: Thus, citrus EO is of great demand and is one of the more promising market prospects [ 8].
6: Grapefruit ( Citrus paradisi Macf.
7: ), one of the worlds largest production citrus families [ 9], is famous for its taste and nutritional value.
8: Grapefruit EO is extracted from grapefruit peel and has been used for a long time as a valuable ingredient for its characteristic aroma in flavor and fragrance [ 10, 11].
9: Similar to most citrus EOs, its major components are terpenes and terpene oxides.
10: Terpene oxides include alcohols, ethers, aldehydes, ketones, and esters [ 12, 13, 14], which are the main source of the aroma, whereas terpenes contribute less to the aroma.
11: In spite of extensive studies on the aroma features of grapefruit EO, in recent years, more and more researchers have become interested in exploring their biological and pharmacological activities.
12: Grapefruit EO has been reported to have a wide range of bioactivities.
13: It was shown to inhibit the growth of food-borne spoilage bacteria and pathogenic strains [ 15, 16, 17].
14: Okunowo et al.
15: (2013) found that grapefruit EO obtained from the peel by hydrodistillation exerted inhibitory effects against bacteria and fungi, andmay be further developed for the treatment of certain diseases [ 18].
16: Grapefruit EO has shown antioxidant activity, which was important for food preservation and disease prevention [ 19, 20].
17: Ahmed et al.
18: (2019) reported that grapefruit EO extracted by hydrodistillation had antioxidant activity by using DPPH and FRAP assays [ 21].
19: Grapefruit peel extracts have been shown to decrease the HL-60 cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner [ 22].
20: In fact, grapefruit extracts (a mixture of EO and other nonvolatile phytochemicals) could also inhibit the growth and proliferation of cancer cells such as neuroblastomas, leukemias, and prostate and lung cancer lines [ 23, 24, 25].
21: Cuthrell et al.
22: (2006) reviewed the anticancer activities of phytochemicals found in grapefruit [ 26].
