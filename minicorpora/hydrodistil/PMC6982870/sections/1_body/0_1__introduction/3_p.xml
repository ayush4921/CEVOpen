<p>Molecular distillation is a special liquidâ€“liquid separation technology under high vacuum, which is employed as a separation process in the food industry [

 <xref rid="B33-molecules-25-00217" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Molecular distillation can divide the EO mixture into two different phases according to the free path of different molecules at low temperature. Molecular distillation is prominent with the advantages of low temperature treatment and high vacuum application, which is very suitable for thermolabile compounds and is used for concentrating and refining EOs [

 <xref rid="B35-molecules-25-00217" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. At present, there are seldom reports on the antibacterial and anticancer activity of Eos obtained by molecular distillation. In this study, the cold-pressed grapefruit EO was processed by molecular distillation technology and the light phase essential oil (LPEO) was collected. Its constituents were identified by GC-MS. The activities of LEPO were tested on microorganisms and malignant proliferating cells (HCT116 colon cancer cells and HepG2 liver cancer cells) were tested. We expect that this work can stimulate the development of new agents for food preservation and chemo-preventive anti-cancer treatments.
