<p>The discussion about anticancer activity of some EO components has been made by Mukhtar et al. [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-25-00217" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Our study preliminarily tested the inhibitory effect of LPEO on the proliferation of HepG2 liver cancer cells and HCT116 colon cancer cells. The anticancer activity of LPEO and its components on cancer cells and their mode of action deserve further study.
