<p>The effects of different concentrations of LPEO on the proliferation of HepG2 liver cancer and HCT116 colon cancer cells were tested by the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) method [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-00217-f002">Figure 2</xref>. The viability rate of both cell types decreased with increasing LPEO concentration. When the concentration of LPEO was less than 0.1 μL/mL, no obvious change of viability of HepG2 cells was observed. However, when the concentration of LPEO was higher than 0.1 μL/mL, the viability of HepG2 cells significantly decreased; at the LPEO concentration of 0.3 μL/mL, the viability was 7.4%only. LPEO also had a good inhibitory effect on the growth of HCT116 colon cancer cells. At the concentration of0.05 μL/mL or higher, the viability of HCT116 cells significantly decreased. It was as low as 7.43% when the concentration of LPEO was 0.5 μL/mL. GraphPad Prism™ (Version 5.00) software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) was used to calculate
