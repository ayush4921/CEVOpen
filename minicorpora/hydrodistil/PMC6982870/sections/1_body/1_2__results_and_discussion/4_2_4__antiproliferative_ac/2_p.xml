<p>Sun et al. (2002) studied antiproliferative activity of grapefruit fruit extract on the growth of HepG2 human liver cancer cells in vitro [

 <sub>50</sub>) value of 130.09 mg/mL. However, they did not identify the specific phytochemicals which were responsible for antiproliferative activity. Manassero et al. (2013) studied the antiproliferative activity of cold-pressed EO from mandarin peel and its principal component limonene [

The much higher activity of mandarin EO than LPEO (0.24 μL/mL) may attributed to other high potent phytochemicals in cold-pressed EO. We have reported antiproliferative activity of the ‘Gannanzao’ orange EO (GOEO) prepared by hydrodistillation, which exhibited

 <xref rid="B43-molecules-25-00217" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. LPEO showed a slightly higher activity than GOEO, which may be attributed to its higher limonene content (LPEO 93.33%, GOEO 88.07%).
