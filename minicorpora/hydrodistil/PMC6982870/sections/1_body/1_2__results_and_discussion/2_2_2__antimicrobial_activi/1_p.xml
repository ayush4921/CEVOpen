<p>Grapefruit EOs prepared by cold-pressing or hydrodistillation using a Clevenger-type apparatus have shown a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity in vitro [

 <xref rid="B37-molecules-25-00217" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. However, antimicrobial activity of grapefruit EO prepared by molecular distillation has not been well studied. We tested LPEO on five microorganisms and the results obtained are shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-00217-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The filter paper diffusion method was used to test the antibacterial activity of LPEO against different bacteria, and the activity of LPEO was evaluated according to the diameter of the inhibition zone and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values. LPEO exhibited strong antibacterial effects on the four bacteria tested. From the scale of the inhibition zone, LPEO had the strongest inhibitory effect on 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> with a maximum diameter of 35.59 mm, followed by 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. typhimurium</italic>. LPEO had no inhibitory activity against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> with an inhibition zone of 8.57 mm. 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> belongs with 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> to the group of Gram-negative bacteria but exhibits quite a different response to LPEO. This phenomenon may be partly due to its relatively low outer membrane permeability. LPEO molecules enter the periplasm by diffusion through the channels of nonspecific porins in the outer membrane, and this pathway in 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is 10- to 100-fold less efficient than that in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-25-00217" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Regarding MIC values, LPEO showed the best antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> with a MIC value of 0.78 µL/mL. Based on the inhibition zone and MIC values, the order of sensitivity of the different bacteria was: 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> &gt; 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> &gt; 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> &gt; 
 <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> &gt; 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. Since cold-pressed grapefruit oil (
 <italic>Citrus paradisi</italic> Macf.) has been evaluated as “generally recognized as safe” (GRAS) by the Expert Panel of the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association (FEMA) [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-25-00217" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], and LPEO, a distillate from cold-pressed EO, showed strong sensitivity to most tested microorganisms, it appeared to be suitable to food applications. These results demonstrate that molecular distillation technology can provide a grapefruit EO fraction with good antimicrobial activity.
