<p>Uysal et al. (2011) evaluated the antibacterial activities of grapefruit Eos from solvent-free microwave extraction (SFME) and hydrodistillation (HD) by the disc-diffusion method [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-25-00217" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The Eos obtained from SFME and HD showed the highest activity against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> with inhibition zones of 53 and 41 mm, respectively, higher than LPEO (24.34 mm). The activity against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (30 mm and 28 mm) was close to our result (26.86 mm). Both of their samples and LPEO showed no obvious activity against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa.</italic> LPEO showed better activity against 
 <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> (21.70 mm) than their samples (15 mm and 13 mm). Although a lot of plant EOs have shown antimicrobial activity, the reason of this capacity is not well known. It could be provoked by the major components of the EOs or due to a synergistic effect among the major components and the minor ones. Different preparation methods yield EO samples with differences in chemical composition and relative content, and cause differences in antimicrobial activity.
