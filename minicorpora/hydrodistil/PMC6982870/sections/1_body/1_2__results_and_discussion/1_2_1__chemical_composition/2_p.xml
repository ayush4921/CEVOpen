<p>As shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-00217-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, twenty-four compounds, accounting for 99.74% of the total oil were identified. Monoterpenes were the major components, accounting for 96.93% of the total oil. Limonene (93.33%) was the predominant component of monoterpenes, followed by β-myrcene (2.16%), α-pinene (0.76%), and sabinene (0.60%). Monoterpene oxide (1.62%) included carvone (0.41%), cis-limonene oxide (0.43%), and trans-limonene oxide (0.33%). The sesquiterpene (0.55%) included caryophyllene (0.20%), β-cubebene (0.14%), α-copaene (0.13%), etc. Caryophyllene oxide (0.04%) was the only sesquiterpene oxide detected. In addition, three linear aldehydes: Octanal (0.36%), decanal (0.19%), and nonanal (0.05%) were found in LPEO. Pino et al. (1999) reported the chemical composition of grapefruit EO prepared by steam distillation from solids and effluents produced during commercial oil extraction [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-25-00217" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The limonene content (70.9%) in steam-distilled oil was much less than LPEO (93.33%); however, the content of myrcene (13.6%) and α-pinene (3.8%) was much higher than LPEO (myrcene 2.16% andα-pinene 0.76%). Also, Okunowo et al. (2013) reported the components of grapefruit EO obtained by hydrodistillation [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-25-00217" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The content of limonene (75.07%)was closed to that of steam-distilled oil. Cold-pressed grapefruit oil was shown to have a limonene content of 93.47%, however, the corrected limonene content became 85.60% when nonvolatiles were excluded [
