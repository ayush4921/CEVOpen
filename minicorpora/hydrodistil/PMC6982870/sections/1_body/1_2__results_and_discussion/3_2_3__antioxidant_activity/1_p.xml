<p>A lot of EOs have been reported to scavenge the free radicals that cause damage to the body and reduce the risk of many diseases originating from oxidative stress. In order to measure the effect of LPEO and determine its potential application in food, cosmetic or pharmaceutical industries, we evaluated its antioxidant activity using two different assays: The 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH)and 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) radical (ABTS) assays. Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) was used as positive control. The
