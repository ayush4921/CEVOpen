0: The constituents of LPEO were analyzed using an Agilent 7890B gas chromatograph coupled with an Agilent mass spectrometer detector (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA).
1: The GC was equipped with a HP-5 column (30.00 m  0.25 mm  0.25 m).
2: Mass spectra were obtained by electron ionization (EI) at 70 eV.
3: The injector and detector were operated at 250 C and 300 C, respectively.
4: The temperature program was 80 C for 4 min, and then increased at 5 C/min to 250 C and held constant for 10 min.
5: The constituents were identified by comparing their mass spectra with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, version 2010, U.S. Department of Commerce, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) data reference.
6: The retention indices (RI) of the constituents were determined by adding a C8C20  n-alkanes mixture to the essential oil before injecting in the GC-MS equipment and analyzing it under the same conditions described above.
