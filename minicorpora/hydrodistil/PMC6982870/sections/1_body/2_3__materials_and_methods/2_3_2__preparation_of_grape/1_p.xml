<p>Grapefruit light phase EO(LPEO) was obtained by molecular distillation from cold-pressed grapefruit EO (
 <italic>Citrus paradisi</italic> Macf., Lakeland, FL, USA) using a wiped-film molecular distillation apparatus (Pope Two Inch Laboratory Scale Wiped-Film Molecular Still &amp; Evaporator, Pope Scientific Inc., Saukville, WI, USA). The evaporation temperature and operation pressure were 55 °C and 6.0 Torr, respectively. Cold-pressed grapefruit EO was fed at room temperature and the feeding rate was 3.0 mL/min. The rotational speed of the roller wiper (Pope Scientific Inc., Saukville, WI, USA) was 325 rpm, and the condenser temperature was 0 °C. The final grapefruit EO sample (LPEO) was obtained from the light phase outlet with the yield of 86%.
