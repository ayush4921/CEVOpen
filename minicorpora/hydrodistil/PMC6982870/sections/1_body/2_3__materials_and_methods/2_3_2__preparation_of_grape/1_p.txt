0: Grapefruit light phase EO(LPEO) was obtained by molecular distillation from cold-pressed grapefruit EO ( Citrus paradisi Macf., Lakeland, FL, USA) using a wiped-film molecular distillation apparatus (Pope Two Inch Laboratory Scale Wiped-Film Molecular Still & Evaporator, Pope Scientific Inc., Saukville, WI, USA).
1: The evaporation temperature and operation pressure were 55 C and 6.0 Torr, respectively.
2: Cold-pressed grapefruit EO was fed at room temperature and the feeding rate was 3.0 mL/min.
3: The rotational speed of the roller wiper (Pope Scientific Inc., Saukville, WI, USA) was 325 rpm, and the condenser temperature was 0 C. The final grapefruit EO sample (LPEO) was obtained from the light phase outlet with the yield of 86%.
