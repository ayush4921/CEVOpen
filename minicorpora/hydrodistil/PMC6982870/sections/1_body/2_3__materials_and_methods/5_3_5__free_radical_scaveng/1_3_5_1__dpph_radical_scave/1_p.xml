<p>The free radical-scavenging activity of LPEO was measured using the stable radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay [
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-25-00217" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. DPPH was dissolved in ethanol at concentration of 0.1 mmol L
 <sup>−1</sup>. The absorbance of 2.7 mL DPPH solution and 0.3 mL ethanol was measured as the negative control. A different concentration of the sample solution in ethanol (0.3 mL) was pipetted into a cuvette with 2.7 mL DPPH solution. The resultant solution was incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the dark, and then monitored at 517 nm. The DPPH scavenging activity was expressed according to the following equation:
 <disp-formula>DPPH scavenging activity (%) = (A
  <sub>C</sub> − A
  <sub>S</sub>)/A
  <sub>C</sub> × 100
  <label>(1)</label>
 </disp-formula> where A
 <sub>C</sub> is the absorbance of the negative control, and A
 <sub>S</sub> is the absorbance containing 0.3 mL sample and 2.7 mL DPPH solution. All samples were analyzed in triplicates, and the results are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation. The scavenging activity was expressed as the 50% inhibitory concentration (
 <italic>IC</italic>
 <sub>50</sub>), which was defined as the sample concentration necessary to inhibit DPPH radical activity by 50% after incubation.
