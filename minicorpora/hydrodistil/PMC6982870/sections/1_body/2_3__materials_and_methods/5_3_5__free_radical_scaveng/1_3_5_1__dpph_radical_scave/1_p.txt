0: The free radical-scavenging activity of LPEO was measured using the stable radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay [ 48].
1: DPPH was dissolved in ethanol at concentration of 0.1 mmol L 1.
2: The absorbance of 2.7 mL DPPH solution and 0.3 mL ethanol was measured as the negative control.
3: A different concentration of the sample solution in ethanol (0.3 mL) was pipetted into a cuvette with 2.7 mL DPPH solution.
4: The resultant solution was incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the dark, and then monitored at 517 nm.
5: The DPPH scavenging activity was expressed according to the following equation: DPPH scavenging activity (%) = (A  C  A  S)/A  C  100  (1) where A C is the absorbance of the negative control, and A S is the absorbance containing 0.3 mL sample and 2.7 mL DPPH solution.
6: All samples were analyzed in triplicates, and the results are expressed as the mean  standard deviation.
7: The scavenging activity was expressed as the 50% inhibitory concentration ( IC50), which was defined as the sample concentration necessary to inhibit DPPH radical activity by 50% after incubation.
