0: This method was performed as described by Teles et al.
1: [ 49], based on the capacity of LPEO to inhibit the 2,2-azinobis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) radical (ABTS).
2: Twenty-five mL of ABTS (7 mM) were added to 440 L of potassium persulfate (K 2S 2O 8, 140 mM), and the solution was kept in darkness for 12 h at room temperature in order to form the radical.
3: An accurate volume of the solution was diluted in ethanol until an absorbance of 0.70 at 734 nm.
4: Once the radical was formed, 2 mL of ABTS solution were mixed with 100L of LPEO and the absorbance measured at734 nm.
5: ABTS scavenging effect was calculated using the following equation: ABTS scavenging activity (%) = (A  C  A  S)/A  C  100  (2) where A S is the absorbance of the solution when the sample has been added and A C is the absorbance of the ABTS solution as control.
6: The  IC50 was calculated from the graph of scavenging percentage against LPEO concentration.
7: The results are expressed as the mean  standard deviation.
