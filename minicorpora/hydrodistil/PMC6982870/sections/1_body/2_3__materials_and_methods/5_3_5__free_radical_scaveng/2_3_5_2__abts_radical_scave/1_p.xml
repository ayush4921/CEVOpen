<p>This method was performed as described by Teles et al. [
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-25-00217" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], based on the capacity of LPEO to inhibit the 2,2′-azinobis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) radical (ABTS). Twenty-five mL of ABTS (7 mM) were added to 440 μL of potassium persulfate (K
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>8</sub>, 140 mM), and the solution was kept in darkness for 12 h at room temperature in order to form the radical. An accurate volume of the solution was diluted in ethanol until an absorbance of 0.70 at 734 nm. Once the radical was formed, 2 mL of ABTS solution were mixed with 100μL of LPEO and the absorbance measured at734 nm. ABTS scavenging effect was calculated using the following equation:
 <disp-formula>ABTS scavenging activity (%) = (A
  <sub>C</sub> − A
  <sub>S</sub>)/A
  <sub>C</sub> × 100
  <label>(2)</label>
 </disp-formula> where A
 <sub>S</sub> is the absorbance of the solution when the sample has been added and A
 <sub>C</sub> is the absorbance of the ABTS solution as control. The 
 <italic>IC</italic>
 <sub>50</sub> was calculated from the graph of scavenging percentage against LPEO concentration. The results are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation.
