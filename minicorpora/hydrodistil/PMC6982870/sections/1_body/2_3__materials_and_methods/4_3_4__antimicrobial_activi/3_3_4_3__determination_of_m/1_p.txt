0: MIC values of LPEO against microorganisms were determined by disc-diffusion method [ 46, 47] Sterile filter paper discs were placed on the surface of Petri dishes and impregnated with 20 L of EO at different concentrations (100.00, 50.00, 25.00, 12.50, 6.25, 3.125, 1.56, 0.78, 0.39, and 0.195 mg/mL) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).
1: DMSO alone was used as negative control.
2: After staying at 4 C for 2 h, all Petri dishes were incubated at 37 C for 24 h. All determinations were performed in triplicates.
3: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were determined as the lowest concentration of EOs that inhibited visible growth of the tested microorganism.
