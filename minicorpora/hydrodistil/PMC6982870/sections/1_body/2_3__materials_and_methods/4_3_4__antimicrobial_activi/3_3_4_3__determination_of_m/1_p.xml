 <xref rid="B47-molecules-25-00217" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] Sterile filter paper discs were placed on the surface of Petri dishes and impregnated with 20 µL of EO at different concentrations (100.00, 50.00, 25.00, 12.50, 6.25, 3.125, 1.56, 0.78, 0.39, and 0.195 mg/mL) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). DMSO alone was used as negative control. After staying at 4 °C for 2 h, all Petri dishes were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. All determinations were performed in triplicates. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were determined as the lowest concentration of EOs that inhibited visible growth of the tested microorganism.
