0: LPEO was tested on five microbial strains, using filter paper diffusion method [ 46].
1: Briefly, a suspension of the tested microorganism (10 6 CFUmL 1) was spread on the solid media plates.
2: The paper discs (Whatman No.
3: 1 filter paper, 6 mm diameter) were impregnated with 20 L LPEO and placed on the inoculated agar.
4: The plates inoculated with bacterial strains were incubated for 24 h at 37 C. After incubation, diameter of the inhibition zone was measured in millimeters.
5: Each test was performed in triplicates on at least three separate experiments.
