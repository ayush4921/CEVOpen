<p>LPEO was tested on five microbial strains, using filter paper diffusion method [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-25-00217" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Briefly, a suspension of the tested microorganism (10
 <sup>6</sup> CFUmL
 <sup>−1</sup>) was spread on the solid media plates. The paper discs (Whatman No. 1 filter paper, 6 mm diameter) were impregnated with 20 μL LPEO and placed on the inoculated agar. The plates inoculated with bacterial strains were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. After incubation, diameter of the inhibition zone was measured in millimeters. Each test was performed in triplicates on at least three separate experiments.
