<p>HCT116 colon cancer cells and HepG2 liver cancer cells were purchased from Library of Typical Culture of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). HCT116 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Hyclone, UT, USA), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Hyclone, UT, USA). HepG2 cells were cultured in MEM containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Hyclone, UT, USA). The above-mentioned cells were maintained in 25 cm
 <sup>2</sup> cell culture flasks in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> at 37 °C. Cells were fed until 90% confluence and the confluent cells were washed twice with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), treated with 0.25% trypsin (Invitrogen, MA, USA) for about 1 min, and incubated at 37 °C. When the cells were contracted and rounded under the microscope, FBS (Hyclone, UT, USA) containing medium was added, centrifuged at 200× 
 <italic>g</italic> for 3 min, and subcultured at a split ratio of 1:3.
