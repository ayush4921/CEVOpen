0: The cell proliferation inhibition rate of LPEO was evaluated by CCK-8 assay [ 42, 43].
1: LPEO (50 L) was added to the medium and mixed well.
2: The mixture was diluted in DMSO to prepare solutions at a concentration of 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1, 0.05, and 0.0 L/mL, respectively.
3: The cells were placed into 96-well plates (3  10 3 cells/well).
4: After 24 h, 100 L of LPEO at different concentrations was added and continued to incubate for 48 h at 37 C in a CO 2 incubator, after which the medium in the 96-well plate was disposed.
5: A 100 L of CCK-8 test solution (DojinDo, Tokyo, Japan) was added and incubated for 2 h at 37 C. The optical density (OD) for each well was measured at 450 nm using a microplate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA).
6: The cell viability rate at different concentrations of LPEO treatment was calculated according to the formula: Viability rate (%) = (OD  sample  OD  blank)/(OD  control  OD  blank)  100%  (3)
