<p>The cell proliferation inhibition rate of LPEO was evaluated by CCK-8 assay [

 <xref rid="B43-molecules-25-00217" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. LPEO (50 μL) was added to the medium and mixed well. The mixture was diluted in DMSO to prepare solutions at a concentration of 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1, 0.05, and 0.0 μL/mL, respectively. The cells were placed into 96-well plates (3 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> cells/well). After 24 h, 100 μL of LPEO at different concentrations was added and continued to incubate for 48 h at 37 °C in a CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator, after which the medium in the 96-well plate was disposed. A 100 μL of CCK-8 test solution (DojinDo, Tokyo, Japan) was added and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. The optical density (OD) for each well was measured at 450 nm using a microplate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA). The cell viability rate at different concentrations of LPEO treatment was calculated according to the formula:
 <disp-formula>Viability rate (%) = (OD
  <sub>sample</sub> − OD
  <sub>blank</sub>)/(OD
  <sub>control</sub> − OD
  <sub>blank</sub>) × 100%
