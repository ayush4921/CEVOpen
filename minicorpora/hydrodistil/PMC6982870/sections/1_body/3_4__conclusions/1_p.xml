<p>Essential oils are valuable plant extracts used in food, medicine and complementary treatment strategies [

However, the bioactivities of grapefruit EO prepared by molecular distillation has not been well studied. Molecular distillation is a very useful technique to separate thermally-sensitive EOs. In our study, molecular distillation was used to remove undesired components from the cold-pressed grapefruit EO to provide light phase EO (LPEO). The chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of LPEO were studied. LPEO showed a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity against some Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms, with MIC values ranging from 0.78 to 12.50 µL/mL. LPEO might be used as a novel antimicrobial agent in the food industry. The antioxidant activity of LPEO by DPPH and ABTS was obtained with

 <sub>50</sub> values of 22.06 ± 0.92 mg/mL and 15.72 ± 0.32 mg/mL, respectively. An in vitro test showed a dose-dependent antiproliferative activity of LPEO on HepG2 and HCT116 cancer cells. Thus, LPEO may potentially be used as a new complementary anticancer agent. However, this still needs further studies.
