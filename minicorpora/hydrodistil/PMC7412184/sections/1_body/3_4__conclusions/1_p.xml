 <italic>L. formosana</italic> trees and their essential oils are important non-timber forest product (NTFP) resources. Due to the lack of research on 
 <italic>L. formosana</italic>, the resources are under-utilized or even being destroyed. The oleoresin essential oils collected from 25 different 
 <italic>L. formosana</italic> trees from different regions of Southern China showed very little variation in either chemical composition or enantiomeric distribution. The essential oil yields ranged from 7.7% to 30.2%. The oleoresin essential oils showed promising antibacterial efficacy against Gram-positive bacteria and antifungal activity. The biological potency, coupled with improved tree-tapping methods, promoted 
 <italic>L. formosana</italic> oleoresin essential oil in terms of its economic potential as well as its therapeutic benefits. This is an innovative research work that extends our understanding of the phytochemistry of this tree as well as providing scientific and practical support for the development and utilization of 
 <italic>L. formosana</italic> tree resources. As a new NTFP product, the oleoresin essential oils also improve awareness of ecosystem protection.
