 <xref rid="B34-plants-09-00822" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]: Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010S (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Columbia, MD, USA), electron impact (EI) mode, electron energy = 70 eV; scan range = 40–400 amu, scan rate = 3.0 scans/s; Restek B-Dex 325 chiral capillary GC column (Restek Corp., Bellefonte, PA, USA) (30 m × 0.25 mm ID × 0.25 μm film thickness). Oven temperature program: starting temperature = 50 °C, temperature increased 1.5 °C/min to 120 °C, then 2 °C/min to 200 °C, and kept at 200 °C for an additional 5 min; carrier gas was helium, flow rate = 1.8 mL/min. For each essential oil sample, a 3%

 <sub>2</sub> was prepared, and 0.1 μL was injected using a split ratio of 1:45. The enantiomers of the monoterpenoids were identified by comparison of retention times with authentic samples obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI, USA). The enantiomer percentages were determined from peak areas.
