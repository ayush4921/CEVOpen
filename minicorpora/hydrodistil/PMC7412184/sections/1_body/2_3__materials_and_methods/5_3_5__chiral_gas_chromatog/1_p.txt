0: Chiral GCMS of the  L. formosana oleoresin essential oils was carried out, as reported previously [ 34]: Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010S (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Columbia, MD, USA), electron impact (EI) mode, electron energy = 70 eV; scan range = 40400 amu, scan rate = 3.0 scans/s; Restek B-Dex 325 chiral capillary GC column (Restek Corp., Bellefonte, PA, USA) (30 m  0.25 mm ID  0.25 m film thickness).
1: Oven temperature program: starting temperature = 50 C, temperature increased 1.5 C/min to 120 C, then 2 C/min to 200 C, and kept at 200 C for an additional 5 min; carrier gas was helium, flow rate = 1.8 mL/min.
2: For each essential oil sample, a 3%  w/ v solution in CH 2Cl 2 was prepared, and 0.1 L was injected using a split ratio of 1:45.
3: The enantiomers of the monoterpenoids were identified by comparison of retention times with authentic samples obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI, USA).
4: The enantiomer percentages were determined from peak areas.
