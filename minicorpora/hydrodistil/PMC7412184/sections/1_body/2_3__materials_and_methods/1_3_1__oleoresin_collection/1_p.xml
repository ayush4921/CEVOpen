 <italic>Liquidambar formosana</italic> oleoresins were collected from 25 individual trees from several locations in Southern China (

The oleoresin tapping practice that was utilized in this work not only increases resin tapping efficiency but also ensures the sustainability of the trees and the ecosystem. It was invented by Zeng and co-workers and named the “downward tapping method of V-shaped” [
 <xref rid="B22-plants-09-00822" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. More specifically, mature 
 <italic>L. formosana</italic> trees with DBH (diameter at breast height) ≥ 60 cm, without pest infection, qualified for oleoresin tapping. The oleoresin tapping was carried out by local farmers at average temperatures above 15 °C. The tapping surface was on the sun-facing side of the trunk. An area of the trunk was shaved of bark, a medial groove was cut in the center of the shaved area, and a V-shaped ditch was cut from top to bottom along the vertical direction of the trunk. The V-shaped angle (β) was between 60° and 80° (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00822-f003">Figure 3</xref>) and was cut to the first or second annual ring of the tree. A minimum 10-cm space was preserved between each V-shaped ditch to ensure the health of the trees. The oleoresin aggregations were located at the bottom of the V-shaped ditch, which guided the oleoresin into a container. Immediately after the resin was collected, it was transferred to amber-colored glass bottles and stored at 4 °C until distillation.
