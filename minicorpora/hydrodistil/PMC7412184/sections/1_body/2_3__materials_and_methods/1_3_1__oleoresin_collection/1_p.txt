0: Liquidambar formosana oleoresins were collected from 25 individual trees from several locations in Southern China ( Table 1).
1: The oleoresin tapping practice that was utilized in this work not only increases resin tapping efficiency but also ensures the sustainability of the trees and the ecosystem.
2: It was invented by Zeng and co-workers and named the downward tapping method of V-shaped [ 22].
3: More specifically, mature  L. formosana trees with DBH (diameter at breast height)  60 cm, without pest infection, qualified for oleoresin tapping.
4: The oleoresin tapping was carried out by local farmers at average temperatures above 15 C. The tapping surface was on the sun-facing side of the trunk.
5: An area of the trunk was shaved of bark, a medial groove was cut in the center of the shaved area, and a V-shaped ditch was cut from top to bottom along the vertical direction of the trunk.
6: The V-shaped angle () was between 60 and 80 ( Figure 3) and was cut to the first or second annual ring of the tree.
7: A minimum 10-cm space was preserved between each V-shaped ditch to ensure the health of the trees.
8: The oleoresin aggregations were located at the bottom of the V-shaped ditch, which guided the oleoresin into a container.
9: Immediately after the resin was collected, it was transferred to amber-colored glass bottles and stored at 4 C until distillation.
