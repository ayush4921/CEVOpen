 <xref rid="B34-plants-09-00822" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]: Shimadzu GC 2010 equipped with FID, a split/splitless injector, and Shimadzu autosampler AOC-20i (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Columbia, MD, USA), with a ZB-5 capillary column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA). The GC–FID measurements were carried out using the same oven temperature program as that for GC–MS. Injector temperature = 250 °C, detector temperature = 280 °C, and nitrogen was the carrier gas, with a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The concentrations of the oleoresin essential oil components were calculated from raw peak areas, normalized to 100%, without standardization.
