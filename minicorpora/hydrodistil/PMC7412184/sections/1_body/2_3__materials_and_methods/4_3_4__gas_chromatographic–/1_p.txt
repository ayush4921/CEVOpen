0: Quantitative analysis of the  L. formosana essential oils was carried out by GCFID, as previously reported [ 34]: Shimadzu GC 2010 equipped with FID, a split/splitless injector, and Shimadzu autosampler AOC-20i (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Columbia, MD, USA), with a ZB-5 capillary column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA).
1: The GCFID measurements were carried out using the same oven temperature program as that for GCMS.
2: Injector temperature = 250 C, detector temperature = 280 C, and nitrogen was the carrier gas, with a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min.
3: The concentrations of the oleoresin essential oil components were calculated from raw peak areas, normalized to 100%, without standardization.
