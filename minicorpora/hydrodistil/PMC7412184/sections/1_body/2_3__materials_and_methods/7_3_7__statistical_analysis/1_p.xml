<p>Multivariate analyses were carried out on the essential oil compositions of the 
 <italic>L. formosana</italic> oleoresins. The chemical compositions of the 25 essential oils were treated as operational taxonomic units (OTUs), and the percentage compositions of 25 major components were used to ascertain the associations between the oleoresin essential oil compositions using agglomerative hierarchical cluster (AHC) analysis, using XLSTAT Premium, version 2018.5.53172 (Addinsoft, Paris, France). The dissimilarity of the samples was evaluated using Euclidean distance, and the clusters were defined using Ward’s method [
 <xref rid="B44-plants-09-00822" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The principal component analysis (PCA) was carried out using the 25 major chemical components as variables, with a Pearson correlation matrix, using XLSTAT Premium, version 2018.1.1.60987 (Addinsoft, Paris, France). In all cases, 625 data (25 samples × 25 variables) were utilized for the principal component analysis.
