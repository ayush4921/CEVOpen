0: All bacteria were cultured on tryptic soy agar, except for  C. acnes, which was grown on tryptic soy agar supplemented with 7% ( v/ v) defibrinated whole sheep blood (Cleveland Scientific, Bath, Ohio, USA), under micro-aerophilic conditions [ 43].
1: All fungi were cultured on yeast malt agar (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).
2: For the bacteria and fungi, 50 L of 1% (w/v) solution of the samples in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was diluted in 50 L of cation-adjusted Mueller Hinton broth (CAMHB) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).
3: The sample solutions were then serially diluted (1:1) in fresh CAMHB to obtain concentrations of 2500, 1250, 625, 313, 156, 78, 39, and 20 g/mL.
4: The microbes were harvested from a fresh culture and added to each well at a concentration of approximately 1.5  10 8 CFU/mL for bacteria and 7.5  10 7 CFU/mL for fungi, and the 96-well microdilution plates for bacteria were incubated at 37 C and the fungi were incubated at 35 C for 24 h. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined as the lowest concentration with no turbidity.
5: Gentamicin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was used as a positive antibiotic control and DMSO was used as the negative control (50 L DMSO diluted in 50 L broth medium and then serially diluted, as above).
6: For fungi, the above-mentioned method was implemented using a yeast-nitrogen base growth medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and amphotericin B (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) as a positive antifungal control.
