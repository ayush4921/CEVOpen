0: The essential oils were screened for antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria ( Bacillus cereus (ATCC No.
1: 14579),  Cutibacterium acnes (ATCC No.
2: 11827),  Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC No.
3: 29213),  Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC No.
4: 12228), and  Streptococcus pyogenes (ATCC No.
5: 19615)) and Gram-negative bacteria ( Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC No.
6: 27853) and  Serratia marcescens (ATCC No.
7: 14756)), and for antifungal activity against molds ( Aspergillus niger (ATCC No.
8: 16888),  Aspergillus fumigatus (ATCC No.
9: 96918),  Microsporum canis (ATCC No.
10: 11621),  Microsporum gypseum (ATCC No.
11: 24102), and  Trichophyton mentagrophytes (ATCC No.
12: 18748)), and one yeast ( Candida albicans (ATCC No.
13: 18804)) using the microbroth dilution technique [ 39, 40], as previously reported [ 41, 42].
14: Individual essential oil components, (( E)-caryophyllene, (+)--pinene, ()--pinene, ()--pinene, camphene, (+)-limonene, and ()-limonene, were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) and were used as received, without additional purification.
