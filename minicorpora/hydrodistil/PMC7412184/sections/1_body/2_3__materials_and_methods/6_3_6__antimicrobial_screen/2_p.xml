<p>All bacteria were cultured on tryptic soy agar, except for 
 <italic>C. acnes</italic>, which was grown on tryptic soy agar supplemented with 7% (

 <xref rid="B43-plants-09-00822" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. All fungi were cultured on yeast malt agar (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). For the bacteria and fungi, 50 μL of 1% (w/v) solution of the samples in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was diluted in 50 μL of cation-adjusted Mueller Hinton broth (CAMHB) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The sample solutions were then serially diluted (1:1) in fresh CAMHB to obtain concentrations of 2500, 1250, 625, 313, 156, 78, 39, and 20 μg/mL. The microbes were harvested from a fresh culture and added to each well at a concentration of approximately 1.5 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/mL for bacteria and 7.5 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> CFU/mL for fungi, and the 96-well microdilution plates for bacteria were incubated at 37 °C and the fungi were incubated at 35 °C for 24 h. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined as the lowest concentration with no turbidity. Gentamicin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was used as a positive antibiotic control and DMSO was used as the negative control (50 μL DMSO diluted in 50 μL broth medium and then serially diluted, as above). For fungi, the above-mentioned method was implemented using a yeast-nitrogen base growth medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and amphotericin B (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) as a positive antifungal control.
