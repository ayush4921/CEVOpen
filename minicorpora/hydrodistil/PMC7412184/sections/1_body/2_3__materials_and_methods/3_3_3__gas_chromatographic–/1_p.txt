0: The oleoresin essential oils from  L. formosana were subjected to gas chromatographicmass spectral (GCMS) analysis, as previously reported [ 34]: Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010 Ultra, electron impact (EI) mode with electron energy = 70 eV, scan range = 40400 atomic mass units, scan rate = 3.0 scans/s, and Shimadzu GC-MS solution software v. 4.45 (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Columbia, MD, USA); ZB-5ms fused silica capillary GC column Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA; (5% phenyl)-polymethylsiloxane stationary phase, 0.25 m film thickness; helium carrier gas, column head pressure = 552 kPa, flow rate = 1.37 mL/min; injector temperature = 260 C, ion source temperature = 260 C; GC oven temperature program: initial temperature = 50 C, temperature increased 2 C/min to 260 C. For each sample, a 5%  w/ v solution in CH 2Cl 2 was prepared, and 0.1 L was injected using a split ratio of 30:1.
1: Identification of the individual components of the essential oils was determined by comparison of the Kovats retention indices, determined using a series of  n-alkanes, in addition to comparison of the mass spectral fragmentation patterns with those found in the MS databases [ 35, 36, 37, 38], using the LabSolutions GCMS solution software version 4.45 (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Columbia, MD, USA) and with matching factors >90%.
