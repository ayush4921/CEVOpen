<p>The trunk of 
 <italic>L. formosana</italic> can secrete an oleoresin due to insects, artificial tapping, or other mechanical damage. 
 <italic>L. formosana</italic> oleoresin is made up of a solid resin component and a volatile component. The essential oil from the oleoresin can be obtained by hydrodistillation. 
 <italic>L. formosana</italic> resin has numerous medical applications in Asian folk medicine, such as being a promoter of blood circulation, an alleviator of blood stasis, an analgesic, and an anti-inflammatory and wound-healing agent [
