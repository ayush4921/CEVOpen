0: The leaves of  L. formosana are a source of lignan glycosides and flavonoid glycosides as well as hydrolysable tannins [ 6, 8], which is consistent with the antioxidant activity of  L. formosana leaf extracts [ 9, 10].
1: The leaf essential oil of  L. formosana from Taiwan has shown -pinene (40.9%), -pinene (24.8%), limonene (18.3%), -phellandrene (8.9%), terpinen-4-ol (8.1%), and sabinene (5.6%) as the major components [ 11].
2: In contrast, another leaf essential oil sample from Taiwan had terpinen-4-ol (32.0%), -pinene (18.0%), -terpinene (13.8%), and -terpinene (9.7%) as the predominant compounds [ 12].
