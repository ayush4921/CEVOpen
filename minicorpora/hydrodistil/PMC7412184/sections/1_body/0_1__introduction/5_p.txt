0: Liquidambar formosana is widely distributed in China, mainly in the Yellow River Basin and further south.
1: However, there is a lack of fundamental research on the development of  L. formosana as a source of non-timber forest products (NTFP), which has limited the comprehensive utilization of this species.
2: This has resulted in little production of  L. formosana oleoresin and low oleoresin product quality.
3: Currently, many  L. formosana trees have been harvested for timber or for pulp [ 20], or they are cleared to allow for grazing [ 21], which is detrimental to the environment.
4: Although they are an important part of the primary forest, according to our field observations, some old  L. formosana trees have been cut down and their growing areas converted into cultivated land.
5: As a renewable NTFP, the oleoresin collection from  L. formosana represents a more eco-friendly practice by preserving old-growth forests while still providing economic incentives for local people.
6: For the sustainable development of  L. formosana plant resources, efforts have been made to develop methods that not only protect the ecology but also increase the oleoresin yield [ 22].
7: The few comprehensive analyses of the potential chemotypes of  L. formosana oleoresin essential oils have not revealed any information about the quality of the oleoresin oils or explained whether the oils had been adulterated.
8: In this work, we present the chemical characterization of  L. formosana oleoresin essential oils, multivariate analyses to define potential chemotypes, and the screening of the oleoresin essential oils for activity against bacteria and fungi of dermatological or pulmonary importance.
