 <italic>Liquidambar formosana</italic> oleoresins were collected from 25 individual trees from several locations in Southern China (i.e., Leye, Longsheng, and Wangmo). These areas are geologically the same; they consist of limestone mountains with karst formations. In general, secondary growth, dominated by younger even-aged trees with low biodiversity, were found in the Wangmo area, whereas the Leye area had old growth trees in naturally biodiverse remnant forest patches. The amount of resin collected from each tree is given in
