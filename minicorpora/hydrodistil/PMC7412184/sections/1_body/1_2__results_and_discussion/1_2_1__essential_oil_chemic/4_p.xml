<p>There is no obvious correlation between the oleoresin essential oil chemistry from the cluster analysis and the geographical location of the collections, but there are some trends. Most of the trees from the Wangmo collections were dominated by (
 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene (groups #2 and #4) and most of the trees from the Leye collection sites were dominated by pinenes (groups #1 and #3). Interestingly, however, adjacent trees (Leye 8 and Leye 9) fell into different clusters (#1 and #2, respectively). Likewise, adjacent trees Leye 6 and Leye 7 were also in different groups (#1 and #3), although both of these groups were dominated by pinenes. Three trees, Wangmo 23, 24, and 25, were collected from the same general area and all showed different chemistries; Wangmo 23 fell into group #2, Wangmo 24 into group #3, and Wangmo 25 into group #4. Furthermore, there does not seem to be a correlation between the time of year (March vs. August) in the observed oleoresin essential oil composition. Thus, for example, samples RE190401D and RE190401E, both collected from Wangmo in March 2019, fell into group #2, along with four Wangmo samples collected in August 2019 (LD190910O, LD190910P, LD190910U, and LD190910V). Similarly, there is little correlation between tree size and oleoresin essential oil composition. Oleoresin essential oils from the largest trees (i.e., LD190910D, LD190910K, and LD190910N) were either in group #1 or group #3 (pinene-rich groups), but one of the smallest trees (LD190910W) also yielded a pinene-rich essential oil (group #3). This suggests that there are no major differences in regard to collection site, size of tree, or collection time of year.
