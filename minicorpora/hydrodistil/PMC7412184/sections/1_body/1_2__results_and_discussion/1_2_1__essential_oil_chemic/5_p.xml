<p>A chiral GC–MS analysis was carried out on the 
 <italic>L. formosana</italic> oleoresin essential oils (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-09-00822">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). For both α-pinene and β-pinene, the (–)-enantiomer predominated (65.1–95.6% and 56.7–97.6%, respectively). Limonene was exclusively (–)-limonene while camphor was exclusively (+)-camphor. The (+)-enantiomers also dominated α-thujene and sabinene, while the (–)-enantiomers dominated camphene, borneol, and bornyl acetate. There are no obvious correlations between the enantiomeric distributions of monoterpenoids and the geographical location, size of tree, or time of year of the collection.
