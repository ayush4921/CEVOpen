<p>The results from the present study (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-09-00822">Supplementary Table S1</xref>) are in qualitative agreement with previous studies on the oleoresin essential oil. Liu and Chen reported α-pinene (24.9%), β-pinene (23.6%), (
 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene (19.6%), and camphene (8.8%) as the major components in the oleoresin essential oil [
 <xref rid="B23-plants-09-00822" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Similarly, Chien and co-workers carried out a solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and found the oleoresin volatiles to have α-pinene (23.3%), (
 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene (22.7%), β-pinene (19.6%), myrcene (10.9%), and limonene (8.4%) [
 <xref rid="B15-plants-09-00822" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Song and Zeng obtained oleoresin essential oils from three different sites (Jiangxi, Guangxi, and Guizhou provinces) [
 <xref rid="B19-plants-09-00822" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. These workers found the oleoresin essential oils to be composed largely of α-pinene (34.1%, 33.5%, 22.4%), β-pinene (21.4%, 23.8%, 15.7%), camphene (14.1%, 7.7%, 7.3%), limonene (7.9%, 4.1%, 3.4%), and (
 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene (7.8%, 8.9%, 26.5%). The present work, however, is much expanded compared to previous examinations of 
 <italic>L. formosana</italic> oleoresin essential oil. In this work, the diameter at breast height (dbh), global positioning system (gps) coordinates, and elevation for 25 individual trees were measured and the oleoresins obtained from each tree. The essential oils were obtained and a more thorough chemical analysis carried out, revealing a total of 191 compounds identified in the essential oils, in order to assess any correlation between these data and the essential oils’ chemical profiles.
