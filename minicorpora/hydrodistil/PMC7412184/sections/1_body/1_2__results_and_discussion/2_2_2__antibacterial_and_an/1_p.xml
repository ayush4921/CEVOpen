 <xref rid="plants-09-00822-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). All of the tested essential oil samples demonstrated similar antibacterial and antifungal profiles, which is not surprising considering the similarity of the essential oil compositions. Sartoratto and co-workers have suggested that essential oils showing minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values &lt; 500 μg/mL are strong inhibitors, while those with MIC values of 600–1500 μg/mL are moderate inhibitors [
 <xref rid="B24-plants-09-00822" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Based upon these criteria, the 
 <italic>L. formosana</italic> oleoresin essential oils showed strong antimicrobial activity against all organisms except for 
 <italic>S. marcescens</italic> (MIC = 625 μg/mL). In particular, the oil of 
 <italic>L. formosana</italic> showed excellent antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> (MIC = 78 μg/mL) and strong antifungal activity against 
 <italic>A. niger</italic> (MIC = 78–313 μg/mL). The mechanisms for antimicrobial activities of essential oils are not completely understood. However, it has been suggested that the lipophilic essential oil components serve to disrupt and penetrate the lipid structure of the cell wall, increasing membrane fluidity and causing the leakage of H
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sup>+</sup> and K
 <sup>+</sup> ions, ultimately leading to cell lysis and death [
