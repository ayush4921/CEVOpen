<p>The antibacterial activity observed for the 
 <italic>L. formosana</italic> oleoresin essential oils against 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> cannot be attributed solely to the activities of the individual major components (
 <xref rid="plants-09-00822-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Thus, for example, (
 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene, α-pinene, β-pinene, camphene, and (+)-limonene have MIC values of 313 μg/mL against 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>, and only (–)-limonene has an MIC value of 78 μg/mL. Similarly, the MIC value for 
 <italic>L. formosana</italic> oleoresin essential oils against 
 <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> was 156 μg/mL, but the MIC values for the major components ranged from 313 μg/mL to 625 μg/mL. It is likely that the synergistic effects of the major components, possibly involving minor components, are responsible for the antimicrobial activity [

 <xref rid="B32-plants-09-00822" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Crevelin and co-workers observed synergistic antimicrobial effects in a combination of α-pinene, β-pinene, (
 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene, and caryophyllene oxide [
 <xref rid="B33-plants-09-00822" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Both α-pinene and β-pinene showed good antifungal activity against 
 <italic>A. niger</italic>, and these components may be responsible for the activity of 
 <italic>L. formosana</italic> essential oil against this fungal organism. (
 <italic>E</italic>)-Caryophyllene, on the other hand, was inactive against 
 <italic>A. niger</italic>.
