<p>In general, the oleoresin essential oils showed better antibacterial activity against Gram-positive organisms over Gram-negative organisms. Except for 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> (MIC = 78 μg/mL), the antibacterial activity of 
 <italic>L. formosana</italic> oleoresin essential oils against Gram-positive organisms was 156 μg/mL, whereas the MIC values against Gram-negative 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> were 313 μg/mL and 625 μg/mL against 
 <italic>S. marcescens</italic>. It has often been observed that Gram-negative bacteria are less susceptible to the inhibitory effects of essential oils than Gram-positive bacteria [
