0: FRAP assay was carried out using the above method [ 58].
1: FRAP test solution was prepared using FeCl 36H 2O in distilled water (final concentration of Fe(III) in the solution was 20 mM), 2,4,6-tri(2-pyridyl)-s-triazine (TPTZ) in 40 mM HCl (final concentration of TPTZ was 10 mM), and 0.3 M CH 3COOH/CH 3COONa buffer solution at pH = 3.6.
2: The FRAP reagent was prepared daily as follows: acetic acid buffer, TPTZ solution, and FRAP test solution were mixed in this order at the volume ratio of 10:1:1.
3: A 3.0 mL aliquot of FRAP reagent was mixed with 300 L of deionized water and 100 L of methanolic essential oil solution (1.0 mg/mL).
4: The mixture was vigorously shaken for 30 s and left in the dark at 37 C for 30 min.
5: Subsequently the absorbance was measured at 593 nm using ethanol as the blank solution.
6: The obtained absorbance values were interpolated in a Trolox calibrate curve (0200 mg/L) and the FRAP values were expressed in mM Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (mM TEAC).
7: BHT and gallic acid were used as positive controls.
8: All of the measurements were performed in triplicate.
