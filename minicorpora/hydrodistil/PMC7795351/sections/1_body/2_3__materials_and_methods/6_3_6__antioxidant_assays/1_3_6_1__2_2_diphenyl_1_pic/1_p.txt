0: The DPPH free radical scavenging activity was estimated by assay based on the method described in the literature [ 56].
1: Briefly, 2.0 mL of 0.5 mmol/L DPPH in ethanol was mixed with 100 L of essential oil of  A. polystachya (0.001, 0.01, 0.1, and 1.0 mg/mL).
2: After 20 min incubation, the absorbance was measured at 517 nm.
3: Trolox and gallic acid were used as positive controls.
4: The percentage of free radical-scavenging capacity was calculated by Equation (2): RSC% = 100%  (A  control  A  sample)/A  control(2) where A sample is the absorbance of DPPH mixed with essential oil and A control is the absorbance of DPPH in which sample has been replaced with ethanol.
5: All measurements were performed in triplicate and reported as the average value.
6: The IC 50 value was determined by linear regression analysis from the obtained radical scavenging capacity (RSC) values.
