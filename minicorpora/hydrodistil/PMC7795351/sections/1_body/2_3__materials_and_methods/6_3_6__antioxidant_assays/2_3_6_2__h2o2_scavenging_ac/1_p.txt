0: The H 2O 2 scavenging activity was determined according to a previously described method [ 57].
1: A solution of hydrogen peroxide (40 mM) was prepared in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4).
2: The samples (from 2.5 to 10 L of the 0.1% essential oil) were added to a hydrogen peroxide solution (0.6 mL, 40 mM).
3: Absorbance of hydrogen peroxide at 230 nm was determined after 10 min.
4: Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and Trolox were used as positive controls.
5: The percentage of scavenging of hydrogen peroxide by the essential oil was calculated using Equation (3): H  2O  2% = 100%  (A  0  A  1)/A  0(3) where A 0 represents the absorbance of the control and A 1 represents the absorbance in the presence of the essential oil and standards.
6: IC 50 was the effective concentration at which 50% of hydrogen peroxide was scavenged.
