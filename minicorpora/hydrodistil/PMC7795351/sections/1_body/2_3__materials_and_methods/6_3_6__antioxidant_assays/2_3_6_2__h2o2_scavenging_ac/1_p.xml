<p>The H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> scavenging activity was determined according to a previously described method [
 <xref rid="B57-molecules-26-00131" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. A solution of hydrogen peroxide (40 mM) was prepared in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The samples (from 2.5 to 10 μL of the 0.1% essential oil) were added to a hydrogen peroxide solution (0.6 mL, 40 mM). Absorbance of hydrogen peroxide at 230 nm was determined after 10 min. Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and Trolox were used as positive controls. The percentage of scavenging of hydrogen peroxide by the essential oil was calculated using Equation (3):
 <disp-formula>H
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>2</sub>% = 100% × (A
  <sub>0</sub> − A
  <sub>1</sub>)/A
  <sub>0</sub>
  <label>(3)</label>
 </disp-formula> where A
 <sub>0</sub> represents the absorbance of the control and A
 <sub>1</sub> represents the absorbance in the presence of the essential oil and standards. IC
 <sub>50</sub> was the effective concentration at which 50% of hydrogen peroxide was scavenged.
