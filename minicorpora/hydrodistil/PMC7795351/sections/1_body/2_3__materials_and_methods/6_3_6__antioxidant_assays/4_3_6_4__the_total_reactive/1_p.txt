0: The TRAP of the essential oil was determined by ABTS + (2,2-azinobi(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)) assay [ 57].
1: The ABTS + (2,2-azinobi(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)) radical solution (150 M) was mixed with 2,2-azo-bis(2-amidino propane) (ABAP) solution (10 mM) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4 solution (100 mM).
2: The mixture was incubated at 45 C for 30 min.
3: 10 L of sample solution was added to 990 L of the resulting blue-green ABTS radical solution.
4: The decrease of absorbance of TRAP solutions and ABTS as blank were recorded after 30 s at room temperature.
5: Then, the absorbance of the samples was measured at 734 nm.
6: The total antioxidant capacity (TRAP) of the essential oil was expressed in mM Trolox equivalents (TEAC), using a standard curve of Trolox (0120 mg/L).
7: BHT and gallic acid were used as positive controls.
8: All measurements were replicated three times.
