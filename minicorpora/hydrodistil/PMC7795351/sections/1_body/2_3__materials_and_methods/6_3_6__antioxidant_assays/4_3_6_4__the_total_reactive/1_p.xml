<p>The TRAP of the essential oil was determined by ABTS
 <sup>+</sup> (2,2′-azinobi(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)) assay [
 <xref rid="B57-molecules-26-00131" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The ABTS
 <sup>+</sup> (2,2′-azinobi(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)) radical solution (150 µM) was mixed with 2,2′-azo-bis(2-amidino propane) (ABAP) solution (10 mM) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4 solution (100 mM). The mixture was incubated at 45 °C for 30 min. 10 µL of sample solution was added to 990 µL of the resulting blue-green ABTS radical solution. The decrease of absorbance of TRAP solutions and ABTS as blank were recorded after 30 s at room temperature. Then, the absorbance of the samples was measured at 734 nm. The total antioxidant capacity (TRAP) of the essential oil was expressed in mM Trolox equivalents (TEAC), using a standard curve of Trolox (0–120 mg/L). BHT and gallic acid were used as positive controls. All measurements were replicated three times.
