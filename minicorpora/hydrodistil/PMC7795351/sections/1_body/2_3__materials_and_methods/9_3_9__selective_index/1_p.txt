0: The selectivity index (SI) is the ratio between the IC 50 value of the  A. polystachya essential oil obtained for CCD 841 CoN cells and the value found for the cancer cell line (Equation (4)).
1: SI = IC  50 (CCD 841 CoN)/IC  50(cancer cell)(4) where a SI > 3 was considered to belong to a selective sample [ 33, 34, 35, 36].
