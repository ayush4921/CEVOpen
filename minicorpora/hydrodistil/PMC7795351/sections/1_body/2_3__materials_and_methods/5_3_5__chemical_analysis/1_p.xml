<p>The essential oil of 
 <italic>A. polystachya</italic> was analyzed by GC–MS. The working conditions were as follows: injector temperature, 250 °C; detector temperature, 280 °C; carrier gas, He at 1.25 mL/min; and oven temperature program: 35 °C for 5 min, increase to 260 °C at 5 °C/min, and then 260 °C for 5 min. Compounds in the chromatogram (see 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-00131">Figure S1 Supplementary Material</xref>) were identified by comparison of their mass spectra with those in the NIST 2014 library database, and by comparison of their retention index with those reported in the literature [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-26-00131" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], for the same type of column or those of commercial standards, when available. The retention indices were determined under the same operating conditions in relation to a homologous n-alkanes series (C
 <sub>8</sub>–C
 <sub>36</sub>) by Equation (1):
 <disp-formula>RI = 100 × (n + Tr
  <sub>(unknown)</sub> − Tr
  <sub>(n)</sub>/Tr
  <sub>(N)</sub> − Tr
  <sub>(n)</sub>)
  <label>(1)</label>
 </disp-formula> where n = the number of carbon atoms in the smaller 
 <italic>n</italic>-alkane; N = the number of carbon atoms in the larger n-alkane; and Tr = the retention time. The components’ relative concentrations were obtained by peak area normalization.
