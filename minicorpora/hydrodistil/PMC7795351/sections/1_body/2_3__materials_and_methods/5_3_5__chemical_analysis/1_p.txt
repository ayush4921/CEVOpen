0: The essential oil of  A. polystachya was analyzed by GCMS.
1: The working conditions were as follows: injector temperature, 250 C; detector temperature, 280 C; carrier gas, He at 1.25 mL/min; and oven temperature program: 35 C for 5 min, increase to 260 C at 5 C/min, and then 260 C for 5 min.
2: Compounds in the chromatogram (see  Figure S1 Supplementary Material) were identified by comparison of their mass spectra with those in the NIST 2014 library database, and by comparison of their retention index with those reported in the literature [ 15], for the same type of column or those of commercial standards, when available.
3: The retention indices were determined under the same operating conditions in relation to a homologous n-alkanes series (C 8C 36) by Equation (1): RI = 100  (n + Tr  (unknown)  Tr  (n)/Tr  (N)  Tr  (n))  (1) where n = the number of carbon atoms in the smaller  n-alkane; N = the number of carbon atoms in the larger n-alkane; and Tr = the retention time.
4: The components relative concentrations were obtained by peak area normalization.
