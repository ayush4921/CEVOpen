0: The panel of cancer cells were seeded at a density of 2  10 4 cells/well into 96-well plates and assayed as described previously [ 59].
1: Test compounds were solubilized just prior to the experiment in 0.1% DMSO.
2: Briefly, cells were treated with increasing concentrations of essential oil (0.625100 g/mL) for 72 h at 37 C in 5% CO 2.
3: The cells which received only the medium containing 0.1% DMSO served as the control group.
4: At the end of essential oil exposure, cells were fixed with 50% trichloroacetic acid at 4 C (TCA final concentration 10%).
5: After washing with distilled water, cells were stained with 0.1% sulforhodamine B (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), dissolved in 1% acetic acid (50 L/well) for 30 min, and subsequently washed with 1% acetic acid to remove unbound stain.
6: Protein-bound stain was solubilized with 100 L of 10 mM unbuffered Tris base.
7: The cell density was determined using a fluorescence plate reader (wavelength 540 nm).
8: Daunorubicin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) were used as positive controls.
9: Values shown are the mean + SD of three independent experiments in triplicate.
10: Finally, Sigma Plot software (Systat Software, San Jose, CA, USA) was used to calculate the IC 50 value.
