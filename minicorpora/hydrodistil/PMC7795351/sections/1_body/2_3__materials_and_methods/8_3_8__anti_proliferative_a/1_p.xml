<p>The panel of cancer cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well into 96-well plates and assayed as described previously [
 <xref rid="B59-molecules-26-00131" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Test compounds were solubilized just prior to the experiment in 0.1% DMSO. Briefly, cells were treated with increasing concentrations of essential oil (0.625–100 µg/mL) for 72 h at 37 °C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. The cells which received only the medium containing 0.1% DMSO served as the control group. At the end of essential oil exposure, cells were fixed with 50% trichloroacetic acid at 4 °C (TCA final concentration 10%). After washing with distilled water, cells were stained with 0.1% sulforhodamine B (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), dissolved in 1% acetic acid (50 µL/well) for 30 min, and subsequently washed with 1% acetic acid to remove unbound stain. Protein-bound stain was solubilized with 100 µL of 10 mM unbuffered Tris base. The cell density was determined using a fluorescence plate reader (wavelength 540 nm). Daunorubicin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) were used as positive controls. Values shown are the mean + SD of three independent experiments in triplicate. Finally, Sigma Plot software (Systat Software, San Jose, CA, USA) was used to calculate the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value.
