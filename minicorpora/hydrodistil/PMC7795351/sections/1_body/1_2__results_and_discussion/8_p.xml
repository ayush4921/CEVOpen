<p>According to recent studies [

 <xref rid="B35-molecules-26-00131" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-26-00131" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], a selectivity index (SI) value of more than three was considered highly selective against cancer cells. In vitro activity of tested samples against the CCD 841 CoN cell line were used to calculate the selectivity indices (Equation (3)), shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00131-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The 
 <italic>A. polystachya</italic> essential oil presented the best selectivity indices against the HT-29 and PC-3 cell lines (4.75 and 4.13 respectively), and 1.6 times less selectivity against the MCF-7 cell line. Based on these results (and selectivity criteria reported in the literature), the essential oil can be considered a selective agent for the MCF-7 cell line, at values above 2, and for PC-3 and HT-29 cells, at values greater than 3 [

 <xref rid="B35-molecules-26-00131" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Finally, the selective activity of the essential oil against the HT-29 cell line is comparable to that of 5-FU, and superior to daunorubicin.
