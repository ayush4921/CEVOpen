<p>The activity is most likely a synergistic effect among the major monoterpenes found in the 
 <italic>A. polystachya</italic> essential oil [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-26-00131" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Among the identified terpenes, 
 <sc>d</sc>-limonene has a demonstrated ability to inhibit cell proliferation, e.g., by inducing apoptosis in lung, stomach, and gastric liver cells [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-26-00131" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Furthermore, carvone has been shown to be cytotoxic in some tumor cell lines [

 <xref rid="B40-molecules-26-00131" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]; for example, 
 <italic>M. spicata</italic> oil—with similar carvone content (65.33%)—showed similar cytotoxic activity against the HeLa cell line [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-26-00131" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values below 10 µg/mL. Besides, carvone is bioactive compound that contribute to the pharmacological activity of the various essential oils in which they are found [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-26-00131" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Previous studies showed that the use of carvone and limonene mixtures enhanced the cytotoxic activity of each of the monoterpenes separately [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-26-00131" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In turn, reports suggest that oxygenated monoterpenes, such as terpineol and linalool present in the oil, contribute to the cytotoxic potential of vegetable oils [

 <xref rid="B45-molecules-26-00131" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In addition, hydrocarbon sesquiterpenes, such as 
 <italic>E</italic>-caryophyllene and α-curcumene, would contribute to the synergistic effect of 
 <italic>A. polystachya</italic> essential oil, since both compounds possess significant anticancer activities, affecting the growth and proliferation of numerous cancer cells [

 <xref rid="B47-molecules-26-00131" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. However, the individual compounds did not exhibit cytotoxic activity against the tumor lines tested. Despite the fact that carvone and limonene did not show cytotoxicity in this study as in other works [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-26-00131" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-26-00131" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-26-00131" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], previous studies showed cytotoxic activity against prostate and breast cancer cell lines [

 <xref rid="B51-molecules-26-00131" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,
 <xref rid="B52-molecules-26-00131" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. These monoterpenes are present in low concentrations in food and have applications in industry and agriculture, increasing the human exposure to these compounds [

 <xref rid="B54-molecules-26-00131" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Finally, our data may represent, in the near future, developments for natural-based cancer treatments or a potential preservative agent.
