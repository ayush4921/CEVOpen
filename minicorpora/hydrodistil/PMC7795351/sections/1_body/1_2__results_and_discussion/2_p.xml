<p>Our results on 
 <italic>A. polystachya</italic> essential oil from fresh leaves collected in central Chile are consistent with other studies, identifying carvone and limonene as the most abundant constituents [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-26-00131" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]; however, our report is the first in which carvone constitutes over 90 percent of the composition. This variation in essential oil content and chemical composition is influenced by many factors, including location, plant age, climate, cultivar, distillation method, and type of distillation apparatus used [
