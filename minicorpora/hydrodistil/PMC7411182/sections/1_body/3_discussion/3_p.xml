<p>Our 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> results were complemented by 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> findings with broiler chickens raised in the absence of in-feed anticoccidials or antibiotics. In our study, the baseline performance level of the broiler flock can be regarded as high, with apparently low environmental stress and limited pathogen challenge. Nonetheless, the group of chickens that received oregano and garlic essential oils demonstrated higher performance as indicated by weight gain, feed-to-gain ratio, and also by lower levels of fecal oocyst excretion. These results are consistent with previous studies with challenged broilers (
