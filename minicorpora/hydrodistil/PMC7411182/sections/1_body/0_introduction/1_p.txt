0: In the last few decades, the performance of broiler chickens has shown a continuous improvement in terms of achieving slaughter body weight in a shorter time, with improved feed efficiency.
1: The main reasons for this achievement have been advances in modern broiler genotypes and intensification of management care and welfare.
2: This remarkable improvement has been achieved in the European Union (EU) even after a ban on use of antibiotic growth promoters since 2006.
3: However, the use of anticoccidial substances and ionophores is still permitted in broiler feeds within the EU.
4: It must be noted that a different legislation frame exists in Canada, the USA, and some other parts of the world regarding drug-free broiler chicken production, where use of anticoccidial as well as antibacterial drugs is restricted ( 1,  2).
5: This situation represents a great challenge to the poultry industry; coccidiosis persists as a problem and remains a major predisposing factor for the occurrence of necrotic enteritis and other pathogenic diseases ( 3,  4).
