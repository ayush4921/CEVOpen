<p>Another medicinal-aromatic plant with potential performance-enhancing, antioxidant, and anticoccidial activities is garlic (
 <italic>Allium sativum</italic>) (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Garlic metabolites, when fed to broiler chicks, have been reported to increase resistance to experimental 
 <italic>Eimeria acervulina</italic> infection and induce major alterations in broiler intestinal lymphocyte transcription in multiple networks including immune-related and cardiovascular-related gene pathways (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). It has been suggested that dietary immunomodulation by bioactive garlic ingredients may indicate a potential substitute to current drug-based strategies for commercial poultry production. The main compounds in garlic are organosulfurs, whose precursors (allicin, diallyl sulfide, and diallyl trisulfide) are believed to play key roles in antioxidant and anti-inflammatory pathways. These compounds appear to present potent anticoccidial activity and, coincidentally, an anti-inflammatory activity protecting host tissue from injuries induced by parasites (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). In some trials, dietary garlic supplementation limited or eliminated the negative effects of coccidial infection and improved average daily gain in challenged birds (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). However, the beneficial results of garlic supplementation on production of healthy broilers has been variable, possibly as a result of heterogeneity in product composition, supplementation dose, nature of processing, and duration of feeding (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Moreover, the potential interactions between different combinations of bioactive ingredients have not been studied in depth.
