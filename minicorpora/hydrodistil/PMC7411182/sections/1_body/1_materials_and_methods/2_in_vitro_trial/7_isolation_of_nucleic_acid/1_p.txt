0: Genomic DNA (gDNA) was isolated using a DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen), according to company instructions.
1: The DNA was eluted in a final volume of 165 l per sample.
2: Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed in a CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hertfordshire, UK) according to Marugan-Hernandez et al.
3: ( 30).
4: Briefly, the quantification of  E. tenella genomes per sample used gDNA and primers specific for the  Eimeria genus 5S rDNA (Fw_5S: TCATCACCCAAAGGGATT and Rv_5S: TTCATACTGCGTCTAATGCAC) ( 31).
5: Each qPCR plate used a mix of 19 l/well (10 l of Ssofast Eva Green, 0.5 l of each 5S primer (10 M), and 8.5 l of water) and 1 l of DNA.
6: Serial dilutions of sporozoite gDNA equivalent to 1  10 7 to 1  10 3 genomes were included to produce a standard curve for genome quantification.
7: All groups and the standard curve were evaluated testing three technical replicates per sample.
