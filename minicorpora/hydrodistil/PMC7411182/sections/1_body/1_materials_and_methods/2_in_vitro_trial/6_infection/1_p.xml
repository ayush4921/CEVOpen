<p>After the pre-treatment, sporozoites were added to infect MDBK monolayers (41°C−5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>, 2 wells/time-point/condition), as described in Pastor-Fernandez et al. (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). At 2 and 24 h post-infection (HPI), infected monolayers were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (0.5 ml/well) and cells were dissociated with 0.3 ml Trypsin–EDTA. After centrifugation (10 min/1,000 × g), the pellet of each sample was retained and resuspended in 0.2 ml Proteinase K/PBS (1:10) and stored at −20°C.
