0: After the pre-treatment, sporozoites were added to infect MDBK monolayers (41C5% CO 2, 2 wells/time-point/condition), as described in Pastor-Fernandez et al.
1: ( 29).
2: At 2 and 24 h post-infection (HPI), infected monolayers were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (0.5 ml/well) and cells were dissociated with 0.3 ml TrypsinEDTA.
3: After centrifugation (10 min/1,000  g), the pellet of each sample was retained and resuspended in 0.2 ml Proteinase K/PBS (1:10) and stored at 20C.
