0: The plant materials were submitted to hydrodistillation for 2 h using a modified Clevenger-type apparatus with a water-cooled oil receiver to reduce hydrodistillation overheating artifacts.
1: The volatiles were trapped in 5 ml gas chromatography-grade  n-hexane, according to the standard procedure described in European Pharmacopeia ( 25), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and kept in closed, air-tight Pyrex containers at 4C until use in the  in vitro and  in vivo trials.
