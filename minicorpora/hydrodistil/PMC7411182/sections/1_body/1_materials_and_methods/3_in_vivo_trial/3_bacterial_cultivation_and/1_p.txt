0: From each chicken, 1 g of intestinal content was homogenized with 9 ml of sterile peptone water solution 0.1%.
1: For bacterial enumeration, Miles and Misra Plate Method (surface drop) was used, and each sample was diluted serially via 12-fold dilutions (from 10 1 to 10 12) using standard 96-well plates for microdilutions.
2: Then 10 l of each dilution was inoculated on media and incubated at 37C for 48 h ( 35).
3: MacConkey agar (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) was used for the isolation and enumeration of  E. coli.
4: All plates were incubated aerobically at 37C for 2448 h. De Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe (MRS) agar (Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK) and TSC agar (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) were used for the isolation and enumeration of  Lactobacilli and  Clostridium perfringens, while media were incubated at 30C for 48 h and at 37C for 2448 h in anaerobic conditions, respectively.
5: Total aerobic and anaerobic counts were determined using standard plate count agar medium (Oxoid) while plates were incubated at 30C aerobically for 2448 h and at 37C anaerobically for 4872 h, respectively.
6: For the detection and enumeration of  Enterobacteriaceae, Violet Red Bile Glycose (VRBG) agar was used and plates were incubated at 37C aerobically for 2448 h. For bacterial count, typical colonies from an appropriate dilution were counted and counts were expressed as CFU  log per 1 g wet weight sample.
7: Typical colonies grown on media were then described and subcultured.
8: Typical colonies from each medium were counted and colony-forming units per gram (CFU/g) of jejunum and cecal contents were calculated based on the given dilution.
9: Typical colonies were selected for pure cultivation and confirmed into species level by VITEK 2 system (bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) ( 36).
