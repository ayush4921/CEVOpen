<p>One hundred eighty 1-day-old male Ross-308 chicks (initial body weight 45.3 ± 0.7 g) were procured from PINDOS APSI hatchery and housed at a commercial poultry farm in Gavria, Arta (latitude 38.617°, longitude 20.767°), Epirus, Greece, during the period of October–December 2019. Each treatment group consisted of 6 replicate pens (length 1.0 m; width 1.1 m) of 15 chicks each. The stocking density was 15 birds/m
 <sup>2</sup> (area of 1.1 m
 <sup>2</sup> per pen). During the trial, commercial breeding and management procedures were employed; natural and artificial light was provided on a basis of 23 h for the first 2 days, 16 h from day 3 to day 14, and 21 h from day 15 to slaughter. Ambient temperature and humidity were controlled. All birds were vaccinated against Newcastle disease, infectious bronchitis, and infectious bursal disease (Gumboro) at the hatchery. Feed and drinking water were offered to all birds
