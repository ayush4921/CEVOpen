 <caption> Effect of G. curviflora EO on AMPARs. (a) Whole-cell current recording of AMPAR subtypes with and without G. curviflora EO treatment. The effect of 80  μM of G. curviflora EO (black) and 10 mM of glutamate alone (white) on the amplitude generated by different AMPARs. (b) The destination rate of various AMPARs before EO treatment (glutamate alone) vs. after treatment (glutamate + EO). Desensitization via the weighted time constant calculated by the pulses per 500 ms on the response of Glu alone and Glu + EO. (c) Pulses per 20 ms on the response of Glu alone and Glu + EO to calculate the deactivation. All trials performed on AMPAR expressing HEK293 cells, where the number of patch whole-cells, n = 5. One-way ANOVA with the following significance presented the data displayed in the figure: ∗ &lt; 0.05; ∗∗ &lt; 0.01; and ∗∗∗ &lt; 0.001; ns: not significant. </caption>
