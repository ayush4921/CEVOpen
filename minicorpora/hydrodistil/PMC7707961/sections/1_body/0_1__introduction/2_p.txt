0: Postsynaptic membranes expressing cation glutamatergic AMPA receptors (AMPARs) are implicated in various plasticity and synaptic transmissions.
1: In the mammalian brain, the postsynaptic AMPARs are fundamentally essential in facilitating the predominantly fast excitatory transmission.
2: Overactivated AMPARs trigger excitotoxicity, involved in numerous neurodegenerative severe illnesses such as AIDS encephalitis, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's, epilepsy, Huntington's, and other neurological disorders [ 3].
