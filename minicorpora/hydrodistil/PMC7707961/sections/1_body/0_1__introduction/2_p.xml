<p>Postsynaptic membranes expressing cation glutamatergic AMPA receptors (AMPARs) are implicated in various plasticity and synaptic transmissions. In the mammalian brain, the postsynaptic AMPARs are fundamentally essential in facilitating the predominantly fast excitatory transmission. Overactivated AMPARs trigger excitotoxicity, involved in numerous neurodegenerative severe illnesses such as AIDS encephalitis, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's, epilepsy, Huntington's, and other neurological disorders [
