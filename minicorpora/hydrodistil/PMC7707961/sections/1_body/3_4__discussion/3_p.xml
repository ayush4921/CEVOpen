<p>The qualitative and quantitative variations in the findings could be attributed to the location and collection time and extraction techniques used. In contrast to the previously reported investigation, the mild microwave ultrasonic apparatus for the extraction of the EO was used in the current study. The previously reported studies used the hydrodistillation procedure, which requires reflux for a long time (≥3 h), which can have an impact on the chemical composition of the EO. The plant material used in the current study was collected on the 19th of May, where the previously reported studies worked on a plant collected in April.</p>
