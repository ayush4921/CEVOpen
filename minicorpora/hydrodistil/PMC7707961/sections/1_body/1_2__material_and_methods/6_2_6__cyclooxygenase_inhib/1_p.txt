0: The EO effect on COX-1 (ovine) and COX-2 (human recombinant) enzymes was determined employing the COX inhibitor screening assay kit no.
1: 560131 of Cayman Chemical (USA).
2: The yellow product of this enzymatic reaction was assessed using a UV-Visible-spectrophotometer (Janeway, 7300, UK) in a Microplate Reader (Bio-Rad, A112, Japan) at 415 nm.
3: The inhibitory assays were conducted at EO concentrations of 0.25 and 0.5  g/mL with a commercial anti-inflammatory drug (celecoxib).
4: The cyclooxygenase inhibitory activity of the tested product was assessed and calculated from the concentrationinhibition response curve  via regression analysis to obtain an inhibited percentage of PGE2.
5: The tested EO concentration resulted in 50% inhibition (IC 50) in the formation of PGE2  via COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes.
