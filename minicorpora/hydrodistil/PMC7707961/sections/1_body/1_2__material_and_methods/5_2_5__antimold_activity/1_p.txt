0: The agar dilution procedure was utilized to assess the anti- Epidermophyton floccosum mold activity for  G. curviflora EO [ 19,  21].
1: The autoclave sterilized Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) was placed in tubes and kept in a water bath at 40C to dilute  G. curviflora EO.
2: The range of concentration of the prepared  G. curviflora EO used ranged from 0.025 to 25  g/mL.
3: At a slanted position, the tubes were left to solidify at a 25C temperature.
4: After the preparation of suspension from the fresh culture of  E. floccosum having similar turbidity to that of 0.5 McFarland standard, 20  L of it was added to each of the tubes.
5: The positive control groups to mold consisted of SDA alone tubes.
6: After 10 days of incubation at room temperature, the results were collected by identifying the concentration that ultimately inhibited the growth of  E. floccosum which was labeled as the minimum inhibitory concentration.
