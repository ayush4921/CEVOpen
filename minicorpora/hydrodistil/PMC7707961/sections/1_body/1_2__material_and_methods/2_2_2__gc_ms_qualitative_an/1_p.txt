0: The identification of  G. curviflora EO components was accomplished using PerkinElmer Elite-5-MS fused-silica capillary column (0.25 mm  30 m, film thickness 0.25  m), where helium was set at 1.1 mL/min flow rate.
1: The temperature of the injector was adjusted at 250C with an initial temperature of 50C, initial hold 5 min, and ramp 4.0C/min to 280C.
2: The total running time was 62.50 min and the solvent delay was from 0 to 4.0 min.
3: MS scan time was from 4 to 62.5 min, covering mass range 50.00 to 300.00 m/z.
4: To cover a mass range of 50.00 to 300.00 m/z, the corresponding MS scan time range was 4 to 62.5 min.
5: Comparing the mass spectra of the  G. curviflora EO to the reference spectra in the MS data Center of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, we identified the plant's components.
6: Finally, by matching their Kovats retention indices with the values reported in the literature, the  G. curviflora EO components were quantified [ 12,  13].
