0: The data obtained from the cyclooxygenase inhibitory assay were displayed as means  SD.
1: t-test was performed to identify and quantify the chemical components while one-way ANOVA was utilized for electrophysiology recordings.
2: The significant differences were considered at  p  0.05 for the cyclooxygenase inhibitory assay, while that for the electrophysiology section was considered at three levels: 0.05, 0.01, and 0.001.
3: At 50% (IC 50), the inhibitory concentration was calculated from BioDataFit HTP 1.2 (USA).
4: Data obtained from whole-cell current recordings were expressed as means  SD of  n = 5 for the number of trials, performed at 60 mV, pH 7.4 at 22C, and analyzed using Wave Metrics, Inc. Igor Pro7.
