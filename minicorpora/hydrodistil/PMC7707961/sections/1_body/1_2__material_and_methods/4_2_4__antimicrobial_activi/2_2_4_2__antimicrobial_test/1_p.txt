0: The well-diffusion assay was used for screening of the antimicrobial activity of  G. curviflora EO.
1: The bacterial suspension was formulated by the addition of selected colonies from agar culture to a test tube containing 5 mL of nutrient broth.
2: Then, the turbidity of the sample was compared to that of McFarland nephelometer tube no.
3: 0.5 (1.5  10 8 CFU/ml).
4: A 1 mL of the suspension was added to 2 mL of nutrient broth (0.5  10 8 CFU/ml).
5: G. curviflora EO underwent a sequential broth dilution technique to evaluate their minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for all tested microbial strains.
