0: (2) Broth Microdilution.
1: The first well consisted of 100  L of RPMI, 1640 broth media, and 100  L of  G. curviflora EO homogenously mixed while the second well only contained 100  L of RPMI and 1640 broth media.
2: From the first well, 100  L was extracted and supplemented to the second well.
3: This process was replicated for the 10 following wells yet leaving the last well as a positive control with only RPMI1640 broth.
4: The  G. curviflora EO at concentrations of 0.065 to 55  g/mL was dispensed in the microwells to assess its antifungal properties.
