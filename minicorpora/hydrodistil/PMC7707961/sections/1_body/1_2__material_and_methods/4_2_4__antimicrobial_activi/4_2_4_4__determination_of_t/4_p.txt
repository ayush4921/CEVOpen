0: (3) Inoculum Preparation.
1: Sabouraud dextrose agar was used to subculture Candida albicans which was set at 37C.
2: After 24 h of subculturing, five colonies were added to 5 mL of 8.5% saline.
3: To obtain a yeast concentration of 1  10 6 to 5  10 6 CFU/mL, we accustomed 0.5 as the cell density by McFarland's standard where the absorbance was set at 625 nm of 0.08 to 0.1.
4: To achieve 1  10 3 to 5  10 3 CFU/mL, the suspension was diluted to 1:50 and then 1:20 using broth medium (RPMI1640 broth), of which 100  L to each well except that of the negative control of yeast growth (well #11).
5: After 48 h incubation of the inoculated plates at 35C for 48 h, a 0.52.5  10 3 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL concentration of microbial cells was obtained.
