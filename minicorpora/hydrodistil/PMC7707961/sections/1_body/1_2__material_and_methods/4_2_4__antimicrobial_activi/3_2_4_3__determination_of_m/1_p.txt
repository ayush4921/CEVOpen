0: Micro broth dilution assay was utilized to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of  G. curviflora EO.
1: A 100  L of MuellerHinton broth was placed in each well of the microtitration plate, followed by the addition of 100  L of a suspension of EO in 2% aqueous DMSO (50  g/mL) into the first well which was mixed using the micropipette.
2: 100  L from the first well was transferred to the next well.
3: This process was replicated for the other 9 wells unlike the last well (#11) that was labeled as a negative control for bacterial growth.
4: The remaining solution from the 100  L was discharged after mixing, since the EO was not added to well number 12 that was labeled as the positive control.
5: Thereafter, 1  L of a bacterial suspension (from 5  10 7 CFU/mL bacterial suspension) was added to all wells excluding the negative control well #11.
6: In well number 12, the inoculated bacteria should grow because it does not contain the EO.
7: After 24 incubation at 35C, the lowest concentration of  G. curviflora EO that caused inhibition of the evident bacterial growth was identified as the MIC.
8: G. curviflora EO was screened twice in each run [ 17,  18].
9: The 2% DMSO solution was used as a positive control for every microbe separately to check the effect on each one (antimicrobial activity for DMSO was considered).
