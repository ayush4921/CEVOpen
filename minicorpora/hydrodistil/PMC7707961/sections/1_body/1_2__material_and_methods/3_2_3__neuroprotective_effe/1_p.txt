0: Previous work from our laboratory provides a methodology for the DNA preparation, cDNA transient transfection, and cell culturing of HEK293 to express AMPARs (of the flip isoform) of different subunits [ 14 16].
1: Two days after the chemical mediated transfection procedure, we proceeded to assess the electrophysiological recordings of the green fluorescent protein cotransfected cells.
2: Prior preparations included the replating of the cells on coverslips layered with laminin.
3: The cells exhibiting a strong fluorescent image were selected to proceed  via gigaseal.
4: The 24 M resistance patch electrodes were produced utilizing borosilicate glass.
5: An integrated patch amplifier IPA (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA, and SutterPatch Software v. 1.1.1 to digitize membrane currents for a short period) was employed to perform the whole-cell patch-clamp technique.
6: The IPA was set at 22C, the sampling frequency at 10 kHz, and the low-pass filter set at 2 kHz, using a membrane potential of 60 mV.
7: The extracellular solution composed of NaCl (0.15 M), KCl (2.8 mM), MgCl 2 (0.5 mM), CaCl 2 (2.0 mM), and NaOH that was attuned to a 7.4 pH.
8: The pipette solution comprised of CsF (0.11 M), CsCl (30 mM), 4 NaCl (4 mM), 0.5 CaCl 2 (0.5 mM), 10 Trypsin EDTA (10 mM) solution B (0.25%), EDTA (0.05%), and 10 HEPES (10 mM) which was adjusted to pH 7.2 with CsOH was prepared.
9: A double-barrel glass (theta tube), set at high-speed piezo solution switcher (Automate Scientific, Berkeley, CA), was employed for continuous wash of the cell from one opening whereas the other provides the currently tested compound to the cell.
10: Pulses per 500 ms resulted in a 1090% solution exchange whereby the velocity of this rate is calculated from the removal of the patch from the electrode.
11: Amplitude was induced due to the ionic strength differences from different solutions.
12: The desensitization was calculated after applying glutamate (10 mM) for 500 ms while deactivation was applied for 20 ms.
13: The total number of trials per experiment was 5 cells to calculate the mean of inhibition, desensitization, and deactivation.
14: The control was recordings for the biophysical properties of glutamate alone; the recordings before and after application of treatment must be indistinguishable to authenticate the effect of EO on the cell and confirm the health of the cell.
