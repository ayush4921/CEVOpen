<p>The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC
 <sub>50</sub>) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) results are summarized in 
 <xref rid="antibiotics-09-00147-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The results clearly showed the potential biological activity of several EOs against most of the bacterial species tested. The thymol-carvacrol-chemotype (I and II) oils from 
 <italic>Lippia origanoides</italic> exhibited the highest antimicrobial activity followed by 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> oil (

 <italic>Lippia alba</italic>, 
 <italic>Cymbopogon nardus</italic> oil, 
 <italic>Swinglea glutinosa</italic> oil, and 
 <italic>Cananga odorata</italic> oil did not show significant results.
