<p>MIC of the EOs against the reference bacterial strain 
 <italic>Chromobacterium violaceum</italic> CVO26 ranged from 0.18 mg/mL to 3.0 mg/mL (
 <xref rid="antibiotics-09-00147-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). A series of sub-MICs concentrations were selected for violacein production screening using CV026 strain. A significant reduction of 88.2% in the pigment production (violacein) was observed with the thymol-carvacrol-chemotype (II) oil from

 <italic>Lippia origanoides</italic> and 
 <italic>Elettaria cardamomum</italic> exhibited a reduction of 70% and 65%, respectively. Bacterial viability of CVO26 was also assessed for both control and treated samples with the EOs and the results, in terms of colony-forming units/mL (CFU/mL), did not show significant differences between both groups. Therefore, the reduction in violacein production was attributed to the biological effect caused by the EO.
