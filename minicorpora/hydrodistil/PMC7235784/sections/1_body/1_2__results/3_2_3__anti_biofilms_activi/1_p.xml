<p>A high inhibitory effect on biofilm formation was observed for most of the essential oils tested. Interestingly, thymol-carvacrol-chemotype (II) oil from 
 <italic>Lippia origanoides</italic> exhibited the most detrimental activity on biofilm formation against all bacterial tested. A biofilm reduction of 75, 73, and 74% on 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> O33, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> O157:H7, and 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> ATCC12228, respectively, was determined for this oil (

 <italic>Lippia origanoides</italic>, 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> oil, and 
 <italic>Cymbopogon martini</italic> oil against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> O157:H7, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> O33, and 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> (
