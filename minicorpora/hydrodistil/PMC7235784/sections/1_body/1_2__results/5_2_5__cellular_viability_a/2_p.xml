<p>Selectivity index (SI) was determined as the logarithm ratio of CC
 <sub>50</sub> and the MIC value for each microorganism (SI = log [CC
 <sub>50</sub>]/[MIC]) [

 <xref rid="B23-antibiotics-09-00147" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Positive values represent elevated selectivity against microorganisms, whereas negative values represent high toxicity to Vero cells. Thymol-carvacrol-chemotype (II) oil from 
 <italic>Lippia origanoides</italic> and 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> oil had positive SI value (selectivity index) in all concentrations tested. Therefore, it means that the above essential oils were more selective against bacteria rather than Vero cells. In contrast, thymol-carvacrol chemotype (I) oil from 
 <italic>Lippia origanoides</italic> and 
 <italic>Cymbopogon martini</italic> oil did show negative SI values, indicating a higher toxicity towards Vero cells.
