<p>Essential oils represent promising control agents to be used in therapeutic treatments. Here, it was demonstrated the high potential activity of thymol-carvacrol-chemotype (I and II) oils from 
 <italic>L. origanoides</italic>, 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic>, and 
 <italic>Cymbopogon martini</italic> oils against biofilm development and QS biosynthesis both in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> bacterial strains. In addition, these EOs did not display any toxic effect on Vero cell line, which indeed, opens the possibility for being used in reasonable design of new therapeutic strategies against the emerging impact of bacterial resistance.
