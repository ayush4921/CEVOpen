<p>Production of violacein pigment by 
 <italic>Chromobacterium violaceum</italic> in the presence or absence of essential oils was quantified spectrophotometrically [
 <xref rid="B49-antibiotics-09-00147" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Briefly, an inoculum of the bacterium was prepared at 0.1 OD (600 nm) and incubated in 3mL of LB broth supplemented with C6-HSL in an Erlenmeyer flask. One-hundred-and-fifty microliters of prepared dilutions of EOs at different concentrations (0.18, 0.37, 0.75, and 1.5 mg/mL) was added to each experimental assay. One-hundred-and-fifty microliters of water (or DMSO) was used as a control. The flasks were incubated at 28 Â°C during 24 h.
