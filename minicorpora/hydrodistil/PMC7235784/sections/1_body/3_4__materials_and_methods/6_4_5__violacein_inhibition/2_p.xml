<p>One microliter of each sample was centrifuged at 13000× 
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet solubilized in 1 mL of DMSO. The final solution was vortexed for 30 s to homogenize the violacein and centrifuged at 13000× 
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min to remove cell debris. The violacein was quantified spectrophotometrically at OD
 <sub>595</sub> (UV-1800 Shimadzu, Japan) [
 <xref rid="B50-antibiotics-09-00147" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Percent inhibition of violacein production in the presence of carvacrol-chemotype oil from 
 <italic>Lippia</italic> was measured as follows, [(OD
 <sub>control</sub>−OD
 <sub>treated</sub>)/OD
 <sub>control</sub>] × 100%. Simultaneously, cell viability of CV026 strain was determined by bacteria viable count. All experiments were carried out with three biological replicates.
