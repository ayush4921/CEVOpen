0: One microliter of each sample was centrifuged at 13000  g for 10 min.
1: The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet solubilized in 1 mL of DMSO.
2: The final solution was vortexed for 30 s to homogenize the violacein and centrifuged at 13000  g for 10 min to remove cell debris.
3: The violacein was quantified spectrophotometrically at OD 595 (UV-1800 Shimadzu, Japan) [ 50].
4: Percent inhibition of violacein production in the presence of carvacrol-chemotype oil from  Lippia was measured as follows, [(OD controlOD treated)/OD control]  100%.
5: Simultaneously, cell viability of CV026 strain was determined by bacteria viable count.
6: All experiments were carried out with three biological replicates.
