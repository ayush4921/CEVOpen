0: Production of violacein pigment by  Chromobacterium violaceum in the presence or absence of essential oils was quantified spectrophotometrically [ 49].
1: Briefly, an inoculum of the bacterium was prepared at 0.1 OD (600 nm) and incubated in 3mL of LB broth supplemented with C6-HSL in an Erlenmeyer flask.
2: One-hundred-and-fifty microliters of prepared dilutions of EOs at different concentrations (0.18, 0.37, 0.75, and 1.5 mg/mL) was added to each experimental assay.
3: One-hundred-and-fifty microliters of water (or DMSO) was used as a control.
4: The flasks were incubated at 28 C during 24 h.
