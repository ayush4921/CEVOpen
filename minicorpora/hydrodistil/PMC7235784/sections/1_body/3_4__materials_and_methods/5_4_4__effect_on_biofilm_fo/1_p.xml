 <italic>E. coli</italic> O157:H7 and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> O33 Luria Bertani (LB) culture medium was used in the same proportions. One-hundred microliters of the respective culture medium was transferred into the plate in the presence of 100 µL subinhibitory concentrations (subMIC) of EOs. 100µL of culture medium was used as control. After incubation for 24 h at 37 °C, the biofilms were washed three times with sterile phosphate buffer saline (PBS pH 7.2) to remove free-floating planktonic bacteria. Biofilms formed by adherent sessile organisms in plate were stained with crystal violet (0.4 %
