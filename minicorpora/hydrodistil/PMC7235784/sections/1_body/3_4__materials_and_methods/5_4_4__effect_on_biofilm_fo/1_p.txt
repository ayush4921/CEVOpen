0: The essential oils were assessed for their potential to prevent biofilm formation of a biofilm produced by strains  E. coli O157:H7,  E. coli O33, and  S. epidermidis ATCC 12228.
1: Individual wells of sterile polyvinyl chloride (PVC) flat bottomed microtitre plates as described previously with some modifications [ 42].
2: Cultures were grown overnight in 3 mL Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) with 1% glucose, diluted in growth medium to 5  10 5 CFU/mL for  S. epidermidis ATCC12228, whereas for  E. coli O157:H7 and  E. coli O33 Luria Bertani (LB) culture medium was used in the same proportions.
3: One-hundred microliters of the respective culture medium was transferred into the plate in the presence of 100 L subinhibitory concentrations (subMIC) of EOs.
4: 100L of culture medium was used as control.
5: After incubation for 24 h at 37 C, the biofilms were washed three times with sterile phosphate buffer saline (PBS pH 7.2) to remove free-floating planktonic bacteria.
6: Biofilms formed by adherent sessile organisms in plate were stained with crystal violet (0.4 %  w/v).
