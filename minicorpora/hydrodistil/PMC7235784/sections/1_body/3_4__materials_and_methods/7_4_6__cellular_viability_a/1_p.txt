0: The EOs were evaluated for their in vitro cytotoxicity on the VERO cell line, a cell linage derived from the kidney of African green monkey ( Cercopithecus aethiops), which has been used in our research group as a suitable cell model for cytotoxicity studies [ 51].
1: The cell line VERO was grown in EMEM culture medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and gentamicyn (50 g/mL) at 37 C in a 5% CO 2 humidified incubator.
2: The cells were plated (7.5  10 3 cells/well) in 96-well microplate.
3: After overnight incubation, VERO cells were treated with EOs at 0.18, 0.37, 0.75, and 1.5 mg/mL during 48 h. Cell viability was assessed by using MTT method [ 52].
4: The absorbance was measured at 540 nm using a microplate reader Multiskan go (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Vantaa-Helsinky, Finland).
5: The results were expressed as a percentage of viable cells in comparison to the control (taken as 100%).
