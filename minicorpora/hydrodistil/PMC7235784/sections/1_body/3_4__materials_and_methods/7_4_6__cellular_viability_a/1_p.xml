<p>The EOs were evaluated for their in vitro cytotoxicity on the VERO cell line, a cell linage derived from the kidney of African green monkey (
 <italic>Cercopithecus aethiops</italic>), which has been used in our research group as a suitable cell model for cytotoxicity studies [
 <xref rid="B51-antibiotics-09-00147" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The cell line VERO was grown in EMEM culture medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and gentamicyn (50 µg/mL) at 37 °C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> humidified incubator. The cells were plated (7.5 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> cells/well) in 96-well microplate. After overnight incubation, VERO cells were treated with EOs at 0.18, 0.37, 0.75, and 1.5 mg/mL during 48 h. Cell viability was assessed by using MTT method [
 <xref rid="B52-antibiotics-09-00147" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The absorbance was measured at 540 nm using a microplate reader Multiskan go (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Vantaa-Helsinky, Finland). The results were expressed as a percentage of viable cells in comparison to the control (taken as 100%).
