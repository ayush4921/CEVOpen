<p>The mass spectra were obtained by electron impact (EI) with energy of 70 eV. The temperature of the ionization chamber and the transfer line remained at 230 and 285 °C, respectively. The mass spectra, total ionic currents (TIC), and extracted ion (EIC) were obtained with a quadrupole analyzer, by means of automatic radiofrequency scanning (full scan) in the mass range of 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 40-350 (5.5 spectra/s). The components of the essential oils were identified by comparison of their mass spectra, obtained by GC-MS, and linear retention index (LRI) in the two columns—polar and non-polar—based on the calculated base of the homologous series of n-alkanes C9-C25 and compared with those of different mass spectral bases and data from scientific literature [
