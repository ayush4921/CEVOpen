0: The mass spectra were obtained by electron impact (EI) with energy of 70 eV.
1: The temperature of the ionization chamber and the transfer line remained at 230 and 285 C, respectively.
2: The mass spectra, total ionic currents (TIC), and extracted ion (EIC) were obtained with a quadrupole analyzer, by means of automatic radiofrequency scanning (full scan) in the mass range of  m/z 40-350 (5.5 spectra/s).
3: The components of the essential oils were identified by comparison of their mass spectra, obtained by GC-MS, and linear retention index (LRI) in the two columnspolar and non-polarbased on the calculated base of the homologous series of n-alkanes C9-C25 and compared with those of different mass spectral bases and data from scientific literature [ 46, 47].
