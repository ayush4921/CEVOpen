<p>The essential oil analysis was carried out using an Agilent Technologies 6890N Series Network System (Palo alto, California, USA) coupled to an Agilent Technologies MSD 5975 
 <italic>Inert</italic> XL mass-selective detector. An apolar capillary column DB-5MS (60 m × 0.25 mm i.d × 0.25 µm, d
 <sub>f</sub>), with a stationary phase of 5% phenyl-poly-(dimethylsiloxane), and a polar capillary column DB-WAX (60 m × 0.25 mm i.d × 0.25 µm, d
 <sub>f</sub>) with stationary phase of poly(ethylene glycol) were used. Helium was used as carrier gas (99.995%), with a constant volumetric flow of 1 mL/min. The oven temperature was programmed from 45 °C (5 min) to 150 °C (3 min) at 3 °C/min, then up to 220 °C (5 min), at 4 °C/min.
