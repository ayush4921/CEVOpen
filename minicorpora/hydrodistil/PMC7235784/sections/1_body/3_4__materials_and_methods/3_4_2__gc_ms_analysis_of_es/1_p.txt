0: The essential oil analysis was carried out using an Agilent Technologies 6890N Series Network System (Palo alto, California, USA) coupled to an Agilent Technologies MSD 5975  Inert XL mass-selective detector.
1: An apolar capillary column DB-5MS (60 m  0.25 mm i.d  0.25 m, d f), with a stationary phase of 5% phenyl-poly-(dimethylsiloxane), and a polar capillary column DB-WAX (60 m  0.25 mm i.d  0.25 m, d f) with stationary phase of poly(ethylene glycol) were used.
2: Helium was used as carrier gas (99.995%), with a constant volumetric flow of 1 mL/min.
3: The oven temperature was programmed from 45 C (5 min) to 150 C (3 min) at 3 C/min, then up to 220 C (5 min), at 4 C/min.
