<p>Essential oils were extracted by microwave-assisted hydrodistillation (MWHD) in a Clevenger-type distillation equipment adapted to a heating system in a Samsung MS-1242zk domestic microwave (Seúl, Korea oven with an output power of 1600 W and 2.4 GHz radiation frequency. The plants (200 g) suspended in water (300 mL) were placed in a 2 L balloon, which was connected to a glass equipment, type Clevenger, with a Dean–Stark distillation reservoir. The plant sample was heated by microwave irradiation for 45 min (3 × 15min, consecutives).
