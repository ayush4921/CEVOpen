<p>Antimicrobial activity of EOs was carried out as previously described with some modifications [
 <xref rid="B48-antibiotics-09-00147" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Briefly, The MIC of essential oils was determined using the broth microdilution method for bacteria, in a 96-well microplate. The essential oils were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Serial dilutions of the essential oils were prepared ranging from 3.0 up to 0.18 mg/mL to a final volume of 100 µL per well. All experiments were conducted with a maximum of 1% (
 <italic>v/v</italic>) DMSO in solution. One-hundred microliters of bacterial suspension were added to each well to obtain a final inoculum concentration of 4.6 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> CFU mL
 <sup>−1</sup> and a working volume of 200µL.

 <italic>E. coli</italic> O33 and CV026 in LB and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> ATCC 12228 in MH were used as growth control. Ofloxacin was used as a positive control. In vitro cultures were incubated at 37 °C with constant agitation during 24 h and the optical density monitored at 595 nm in a Bio-Rad iMark microplate absorbance reader version 1.02.01 (California, USA).
