0: Antimicrobial activity of EOs was carried out as previously described with some modifications [ 48].
1: Briefly, The MIC of essential oils was determined using the broth microdilution method for bacteria, in a 96-well microplate.
2: The essential oils were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).
3: Serial dilutions of the essential oils were prepared ranging from 3.0 up to 0.18 mg/mL to a final volume of 100 L per well.
4: All experiments were conducted with a maximum of 1% ( v/v) DMSO in solution.
5: One-hundred microliters of bacterial suspension were added to each well to obtain a final inoculum concentration of 4.6  10 7 CFU mL 1 and a working volume of 200L.
6: E. coli O157:H7,  E. coli O33 and CV026 in LB and  Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228 in MH were used as growth control.
7: Ofloxacin was used as a positive control.
8: In vitro cultures were incubated at 37 C with constant agitation during 24 h and the optical density monitored at 595 nm in a Bio-Rad iMark microplate absorbance reader version 1.02.01 (California, USA).
