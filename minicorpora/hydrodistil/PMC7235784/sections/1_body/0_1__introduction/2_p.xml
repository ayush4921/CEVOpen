 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> are among the bacterial species of high interest in clinical research. 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> O157:H7 is a Gram-negative foodborne pathogen that produce Shiga toxins, and it is responsible of causing diseases such as hemorrhagic colitis, hemolytic uremic syndrome, and the fatal thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [

 <italic>E. coli</italic> O157:H7 is able to form biofilms on biotic and abiotic surfaces such as stainless steel sheet, polymers, glass, and plant tissues if the appropriate conditions are given [

 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> is a Gram-positive opportunistic pathogen that causes biofilm to grow on intravascular devices placed within the body and fracture fixation infections [
 <xref rid="B9-antibiotics-09-00147" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The biofilm confers antibiotic resistance and induces a decrease in host responses, leading towards severe conditions such as bacteremia, sepsis, and even the death [
