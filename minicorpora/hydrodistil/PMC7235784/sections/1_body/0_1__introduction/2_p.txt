0: Escherichia coli and  Staphylococcus epidermidis are among the bacterial species of high interest in clinical research.
1: E. coli O157:H7 is a Gram-negative foodborne pathogen that produce Shiga toxins, and it is responsible of causing diseases such as hemorrhagic colitis, hemolytic uremic syndrome, and the fatal thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [ 6, 7].
2: E. coli O157:H7 is able to form biofilms on biotic and abiotic surfaces such as stainless steel sheet, polymers, glass, and plant tissues if the appropriate conditions are given [ 8].
3: On the other hand,  S. epidermidis is a Gram-positive opportunistic pathogen that causes biofilm to grow on intravascular devices placed within the body and fracture fixation infections [ 9].
4: The biofilm confers antibiotic resistance and induces a decrease in host responses, leading towards severe conditions such as bacteremia, sepsis, and even the death [ 10].
5: Approximately 80% of the most common infections during medical implant procedures such as joint prostheses, cardiac pacemakers, and central venous catheters are caused by  S. epidermidis [ 11].
