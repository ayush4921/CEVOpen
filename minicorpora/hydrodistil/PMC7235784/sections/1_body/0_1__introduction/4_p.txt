0: The essential oils (EOs), a mixture of a large and diverse class of terpenoid and phenolic compounds isolated from aromatic plants, have been of such a great interest during the last decades for exhibiting broad biological properties; among them, antibacterial, antiparasitic, antifungal, and antiviral properties have been reported [ 17, 18].
1: In addition, previous studies have also demonstrated the potential activity of EOs as antineoplastic, anti-inflammatory, allelopathic, antioxidant, insecticidal, and repellent, making them excellent candidates for new natural drugs discovery [ 19, 20, 21].
2: Thus, in this study,  E. coli and  S. epidermidis were both selected for studying the antimicrobial, antibiofilm and anti-QS activities of seventeen essential oils derived from  Lippia origanoides,  Thymus vulgaris,  Lippia alba,  Cymbopogon martini,  Cymbopogon flexuosus,  Rosmarinus officinales,  Salvia officinales,  Swinglea glutinosa,  Tagetes lucida,  Satureja viminea,  Cananga odorata,  Citrus sinensis, and  Elettaria cardamomum.
