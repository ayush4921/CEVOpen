0: The antimicrobial resistance is, currently, an urgent threat to global public health.
1: The poor set of antibiotics available in the market, its indiscriminate abuse in the treatments, and the slow rate of new therapeutic agents have led to an antibiotic resistant crisis during the last decades [ 1].
2: In this context, biofilms, a consortium of cell bacteria with a complex matrix of DNA, proteins, and polysaccharides, are among the most relevant clinical importance, as they protect the microorganism by allowing them survive hostile environments, hinder antibiotic uptake, and represent more than 80% of the microbial infections worldwide [ 2, 3].
3: The formation of bacterial biofilms is well known for their physical and biological properties that confers resistance against antibiotics, and therefore it is one of the major challenges in the current antibiotic therapy [ 4, 5].
