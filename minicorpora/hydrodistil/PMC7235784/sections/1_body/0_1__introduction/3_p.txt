0: Quorum sensing (QS), a mechanism of bacterial communication by using diffusible molecules known as autoinducers, plays an important role in the gene expression induction to control the cell behaviors such as bioluminescence, virulent factors secretion, biofilm development, and survival to antimicrobial agents [ 12, 13].
1: Autoinducers are studied under three different classes based on their structure and specific function: Acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) are responsible for facilitating cell signaling in Gram-negative bacteria, autoinducing peptides (AIP) are the molecules responsible for bacterial communication in Gram-positive bacteria, and autoinducer-2 (AI-2) represents furanones that allow communication in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria [ 14, 15].
2: Therefore, searching for new therapeutic candidates that interfere with bacterial QS-production has become an urgent and interesting research topic to try to counteract the bacterial resistance [ 16].
