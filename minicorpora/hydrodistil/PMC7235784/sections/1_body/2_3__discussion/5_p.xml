<p>Bacterial biofilm, a matrix of extracellular polymeric substances, has become as one of the main factors on the rapid emergence of resistant bacteria to conventional antibiotics. Therefore, new therapeutic strategies are currently needed to counter the negative impact caused by the bacteria resistance to antibiotics. In this regard, essential oils with antibiofilm properties could be a priceless and safe alternative against the emergence bacterial resistance. In this study, the effect of EOs on biofilm formation from 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> O157:H7, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> O33, and 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> ATCC 12228 was investigated. From the results, it was noteworthy the high anti-biofilm activity exhibited by thymol-carvacrol-chemotype (II) oil from 
 <italic>Lippia origanoides</italic>, which, in fact, did not affect the rate growth of planktonic bacteria.
