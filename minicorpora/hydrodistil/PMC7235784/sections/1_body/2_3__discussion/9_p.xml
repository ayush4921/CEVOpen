<p>On the other hand, Ahmad and coworkers did study the anti-QS effect of some metabolites present in the EOs. Among their findings, the metabolite œÅ-cimeno exhibited a higher activity than its counterpart carvacrol and thymol [

 <italic>L. origanoides</italic> could be the result of a synergistic mechanism among the diverse metabolites present which contribute to potentiate the biological activity. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to understand the biological role of each metabolite present in the EOs as inhibitors of biosynthetic pathways involved in bacterial resistant and pathogenesis.
