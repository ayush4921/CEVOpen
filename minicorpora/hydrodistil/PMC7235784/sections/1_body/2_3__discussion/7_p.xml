<p>Previous studies have demonstrated the anti-biofilm activity of monoterpenoids both on Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria during the first stages of biofilm development [

 <xref rid="B39-antibiotics-09-00147" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="B40-antibiotics-09-00147" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Particularly, carvacrol seems to cause a decrease in flagellar development of the bacterial cell, leading to loss of cell motility and affecting biofilm development on several pathogenic bacteria [
 <xref rid="B41-antibiotics-09-00147" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Our results suggest that thymol-carvacrol-chemotype I and II oils from 
 <italic>Lippia origanoides</italic> are potential inhibitors of the biofilm development on 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S. epidermidis.</italic> For the last case, interestingly, it was observed a higher inhibitory effect of the EO on the biofilm development, which in fact, was even higher than those reported by other authors [
 <xref rid="B42-antibiotics-09-00147" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Here, the inhibition of poly-N-acetylglucosamine polymers biosynthesis, the major components of the biofilm structure in 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>, could be a plausible mechanism of the effect caused by the essential oil.
