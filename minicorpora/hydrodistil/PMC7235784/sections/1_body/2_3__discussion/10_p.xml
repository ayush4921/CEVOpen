<p>The essential oils represent an excellent alternative to be used as antibiotics against resistant bacterial species. In this sense, they should meet health safety for inclusion as therapeutic treatments. Therefore, a preliminary study of EOs cytotoxicity was performed in Vero cell line. Interestingly, the selectivity index (SI) found for thymol-carvacrol-chemotype (I and II) from 
 <italic>L. origanoides</italic> had a higher affinity towards the bacterial species assessed rather than Vero cells. Overall, this result along with the high anti-biofilm and -QS activities found for these essential oils, position them as promising natural products in the development of new and better therapeutic strategies to the emergence clinical issues.
