<p>Therefore, the anti-QS activity of the EOs used in our study was also explored by using 
 <italic>C. violaceum</italic> CV026 as biological model. All essential oils did not exhibit anti-QS activity except for thymol-carvacrol chemotype (I and II) from 
 <italic>Lippia origanoides</italic> and 
 <italic>Elettaria cardamomum</italic>, which significantly inhibited the violacein production at 0.20, 0.75, and 1.00 mg/mL, respectively. Although the action mechanism of the EOs is not completely understood, our results suggest that they could act through the inhibition in the production of AHL or by blocking the cell–cell communication system. Cervantes and coworkers did report a poor anti-QS activity of the essential oils from 
 <italic>Lippia origanoides</italic> at the concentrations tested (2.5–25.0 µg/mL). However, note that thymol and carvacrol metabolites were present in low concentrations in such EO, and thereby it highlights the importance of these metabolites as the ones responsible for the anti-QS activity [
