<p>The essential oils assessed did show strong bacterial growth inhibition on

 <xref rid="antibiotics-09-00147-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Thymol-carvacrol chemotype (I and II) oils from 
 <italic>Lippia origanoides</italic> along with 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> oil were found to be the most effective antimicrobials, exhibiting MICs values in the range of 0.37 to 0.75 mg/mL. The major phenolic compounds identified in 
 <italic>Lippia origanoides</italic> oils, carvacrol, and thymol, are well recognized for exerting higher biological activity in comparison with other components such as limonene, geraniol, citronellal, and 1,8-cineol, the major metabolites of some essential oils [

 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic>, to date, they have not been associated with antimicrobial properties [

 <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic>, Salmonella 
 <italic>enterica</italic> serovar typhi, and
