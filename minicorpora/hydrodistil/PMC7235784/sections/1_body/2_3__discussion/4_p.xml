<p>Note that although the action mechanism of thymol and carvacrol has not been completely elucidated, it appears to act through a disruption of the cell membrane, which leads to increased cell permeability, membrane potential decay, dissipation of pH gradients, intracellular nutrient leaking, and subsequent cell death [

 <xref rid="B34-antibiotics-09-00147" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] also reported a strong enzymatic inhibition, particularly in the glycolysis and Krebs cycle pathways, when 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> was treated with carvacrol; however, this toxic effect could be reduced when glucose was added to the culture medium. On the other hand, thymol seems to have a greater activity against gram-positive than gram-negative bacteria, in part, due to lipid disturbance on the plasma membrane caused by this metabolite [
