0: Although the chemical compositions of lavender essential oil were studied by GC-MS in different literatures [ 4, 5], there is no report on the separation and analysis of lavender essential oil by preparative gas chromatography (pGC), NMR and GC-MS equipped with three capillary columns of different polarities.
1: This study could not only verify experimental results, but also the isolated monomer by pGC is of great help to the study of the activity of the single and composite component of lavender essential oil.
2: The combination of these two methods can effectively solve the problem of identifying the accuracy of essential oil components by GC-MS without reference compounds.
3: Therefore, the study has important analytical significance for identifying essential oil components.
