 <xref rid="B35-molecules-25-03166" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], 15 compounds were newly identified. In this study, sulfur was isolated from essential oil for the first time, and was identified by GC-MS, whose mass spectrogram is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-03166">Figures S2 and S3 (Supplementary Materials)</xref>. Therefore, it was proved that lavender essential oil contained a small amount of sulfur compounds. The sulfur compounds provide a new explanation for the insecticidal activity of lavender essential oil and provide a new research idea for later researchers. This finding may help to develop lavender essential oil into a new natural acaricides [
