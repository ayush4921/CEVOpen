<p>The essential oil was extracted by hydrodistillation from the fresh plants of lavender aerial parts, and the mean values of the oil yields were 1.3% (
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic>; mL/g) based on fresh weights. The essential oil GC-MS results of three different polarity capillary columns, which were HP-5 ms, HP-1 and HP-INNOWax capillary columns, are presented in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-03166-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-03166">Figures S1–S3 (Supplementary Materials)</xref>. The relative content of the essential oil components was normalized by peak area and expressed as a percentage. The integration method is that 0.8% of the maximum peak area was selected as the minimum integral peak. According to the above integration method, 40 peaks could be identified by comparing their real retention indices relative to 
 <italic>n</italic>-alkanes (C
 <sub>7</sub>–C
 <sub>30</sub>) and mass spectra with the NIST 14 (National Institute of Standards and Technology, USA; 14th edition) Mass Spectral Library, which accounts for 92.03% of the total amount of essential oil compounds. The ninth peak can be determined as the mixed peak of the 
 <italic>cis</italic> and 
 <italic>trans</italic> isomer of the linalool oxide according to the GC-MS results of the HP-1 and HP-INNOWax capillary columns.
