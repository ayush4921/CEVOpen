<p>Forty compounds were identified in the essential oil by GC-MS, representing 92.03% of the total volatiles (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-03166-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The identified monomers belong to different chemical classes and are present in different proportions. The essential oil contains essentially oxygenated monoterpenes (31.53%) and esters (43.23%), significant fraction monoterpene hydrocarbons (8.03%), sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (3.61%), oxygenated sesquiterpenes (4.54%), and small quantities of other compounds (1.14%). Linalool (
