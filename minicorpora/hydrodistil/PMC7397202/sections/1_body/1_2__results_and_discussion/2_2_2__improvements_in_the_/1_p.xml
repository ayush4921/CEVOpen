<p>In the early stages of the separation of lavender essential oils by pGC, we found that the cost and separation efficiency of this instrument were too low. To solve this problem, we converted the liquid nitrogen cooling system of the fraction collector to a cold trap cooling system. This improvement not only increased efficiency but also greatly reduced costs.</p>
