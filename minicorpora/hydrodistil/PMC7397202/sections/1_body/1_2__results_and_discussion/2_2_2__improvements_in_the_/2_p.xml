<p>By improving the preparation fraction collector of pGC without affecting the normal operation of the pGC, it was found that the improved pGC had a similar collection amount in the same time and temperature compared with the unmodified equipment. The liquid nitrogen cooling system of the preparative fraction collector of pGC was transformed into a cold well cooling system. This improvement doubled the efficiency of preparative gas chromatography, and the cost of the cooling system was reduced from RMB 675/day to RMB 25/day.</p>
