<p>The lavender essential oil was obtained from aerial parts of the lavender that were cut into about 2 cm by hydrodistillation for 3 h using a self-assembling Clevenger-type apparatus, and the ratio of material to liquid was 1:10. The essential oil was collected, centrifuged, and taken from the upper layer. The lavender essential oil was extracted three times with 1200 g of material each time. The yields were 12.9852 g, 13.9137 g and 11.5129 g, respectively. The upper layer (essential oil) was dried over Na
