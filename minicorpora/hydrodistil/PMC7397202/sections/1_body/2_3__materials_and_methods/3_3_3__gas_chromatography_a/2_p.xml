<p>Helium was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The injector and detector temperatures were 250 °C. The oven temperature was programmed from 70 (10 min) to 100 °C at a rate of 2 °C/min, then from 100 to 200 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min. The injection volumes were 0.4 µL. The split injection was conducted with a split ratio of 1:40. The mass spectra were recorded at 70 eV (EI) and were scanned in the range 50–500
