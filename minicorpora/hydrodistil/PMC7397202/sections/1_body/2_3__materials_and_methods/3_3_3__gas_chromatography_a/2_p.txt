0: Helium was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 mL/min.
1: The injector and detector temperatures were 250 C. The oven temperature was programmed from 70 (10 min) to 100 C at a rate of 2 C/min, then from 100 to 200 C at a rate of 5 C/min.
2: The injection volumes were 0.4 L. The split injection was conducted with a split ratio of 1:40.
3: The mass spectra were recorded at 70 eV (EI) and were scanned in the range 50500  m/ z.
