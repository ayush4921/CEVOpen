0: The essential oil was analyzed on the Agilent GC-MS system consisting of a 7693 autosampler and 7890A gas chromatograph connected to a 5975C mass spectrometer (Santa Clara, CA, USA) (inert XL EI/CI MSD with Triple-Axis detector), controlled by 5975-7890GC-MS software (Santa Clara, CA, USA).
1: The GC was equipped with HP-INNOWax (30 m  0.25 mm i.d., film thickness 0.25 m) and HP-1 capillary columns (30 m  0.25 mm i.d., film thickness 0.25 m).
2: Nitrogen was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min.
3: The injector and detector temperatures were 250 C. The oven temperature was programmed from 60 to 180 C at a rate of 8 C/min, then from 180 to 240 C (5 min) at a rate of 10 C/min.
4: The injection volumes were 0.8 L. The split injection was conducted with a split ratio of 1:40.
5: The mass spectra were recorded at 70 eV (EI) and were scanned in the range 30500  m/ z.
6: The components were identified by comparing their real retention indices relative to the  n-alkanes (C 7C 30) and the mass spectra with the NIST 14 Mass Spectral Library.
7: The formula for calculating the retention index is as follows [ 36]: (1)RI =100Z +100 (Tx Tz)/(Tz+1 Tz) where T X is the component retention time; Z is the carbon number of  n-alkanes component; T Z is the the retention time of  n-alkanes that carbon number is Z; and T Z+1 is the the retention time of  n-alkanes that carbon number is Z + 1.
