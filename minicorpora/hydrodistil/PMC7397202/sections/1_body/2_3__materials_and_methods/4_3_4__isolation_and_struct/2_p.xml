<p>In brief, 30.0 g of essential oil was firstly separated by silica gel column chromatography. The separation conditions were 380 g, 200–300 mesh silica gel and 60 × 600 mm column volume. The elution gradients were 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane:ethyl acetate = 100:0, 100:1, 100:1.5, 100:3, 100:8, 100:15, 100:30, 100:50, 0:100. According to the results of the thin layer, divided appropriately, the fractions were condensed to 4 mL and stored in brown vials at −20 °C. Then, suitable fractions were selected to separate monomers by improved pGC. Seven fractions were selected to separate the compounds by pGC, which were successively named A-G. Compound 38 (3.0 mg), compound 39 (1.3 mg), and compound 40 (0.8 mg) were prepared from A fractions by pGC. The injection volumes were 0.5 µL. The number of injections was 466. The oven temperature of pGC was programmed from 70 to 160 °C at a rate of 50 °C/min, then from 160 to 174 °C at a rate of 2 °C/min, and then from 174 to 280 °C (0.5 min) at a rate of 50 °C/min. Compounds 13 (1.5 mg), 18 (1.9 mg), 21 (3.7 mg) and 41 (0.7 mg) were prepared from B fractions by pGC. The injection volumes were 0.5 µL. The number of injections was 411. The oven temperature of pGC was programmed from 70 to 150 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min, then from 150 to 250 °C (0.5 min) at a rate of 50 °C/min. Compounds 27 (25.7 mg), 32 (15.3 mg), 43 (3.5 mg) and 46 (1.4 mg) were prepared from C fractions by pGC. The injection volumes were 1.0 µL. The number of injections was 524. The oven temperature of pGC was programmed from 100 to 170 °C at a rate of 10 °C per min, then from 170 to 250 °C (1.5 min) at a rate of 30 °C/min. Compounds 18 (3.8 mg), 17 (4.2 mg) and 41 (0.3 mg) were prepared from D fractions by pGC. The injection volumes were 1.0 µL. The number of injections was 435. The oven temperature of pGC was programmed from 150 (5 min) to 230 °C at a rate of 20 °C/min (1.5 min). Compounds 10 (5.2 mg) and 33 (2.7 mg) were prepared from E fractions by pGC. The injection volumes were 1.0 µL. The number of injections was 376. The oven temperature of pGC was programmed from 140 to 150 °C at a rate of 2 °C/min, then from 150 to 180 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min, then from 180 to 280 °C (5 min) at a rate of 100 °C/min. Compound 29 (27.5 mg) was prepared from F fractions by pGC. The injection volumes were 5.0 µL. The number of injections was 241. The oven temperature of pGC was programmed from 100 to 240 °C (1.5 min) at a rate of 20 °C/min. Compound 45 (1.0 mg) was prepared from G fractions by pGC. The injection volumes were 4.0 µL. The number of injections was 431. The oven temperature of pGC was programmed from 100 to 200 °C at a rate of 25 °C/min, then from 200 to 250 °C (3 min) at a rate of 20 °C/min. The structure of the monomers was proved by
