<p>In this study, the chemical composition of the lavender essential oil obtained from the aerial parts was studied by pGC and GC-MS equipped with three capillary columns of different polarity for the first time. Using GC-MS equipped with three capillary columns to analyze lavender essential oil made the composition accuracy of lavender essential oil more valuable for reference. Compared with the method of determining compounds by GC-MS, six missing compositions, which were 2,2,6-trimethyl-6-vinyltetrahydro-2
 <italic>H</italic>-pyran-3-ol, 3,7-dimethylocta-1,7-diene-3,6-diol, (
 <italic>E</italic>)-7-hydroxy-3,7-dimethylocta-1,5-dien-ylacetate, 11-hydroxy-Î±-santal-9-ene, (3

 <italic>R</italic>)-2-(hydroxymethyl)-5,5,9-trimethyltricyclo[7.2.0.0(3,6)]undecan-2-ol and (6
 <italic>R</italic>,10
 <italic>R</italic>)-6,10,14-Trimethyl-2-pentadecanone, were identified. In comparison with the literature about lavender essential oil, 15 compounds were newly identified. The improved pGC not only doubled the efficiency but also greatly reduced the cost. This improved pGC also holds great promise.
