0: Natural compounds obtained from different medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs) have gained respect as alternative treatments, as well as raw material for different applications.
1: Medicinal plants are a source of bioactive compounds that act as drugs in traditional treatments [ 1]; meanwhile, aromatic plants represent a rich source of essential oils, which can be used for their aroma and flavor [ 2].
2: MAPs are also used in cosmetics, functional food, or natural dyes production [ 3], thousands of species are all over the world being explored and exploited [ 4].
3: Another recent application is in the nanotechnology area, where the plant extracts phytoconstituents act as reducing and capping agents for the reduction of metallic ions from solutions in order to obtain different metallic nanoparticles, with further biomedical or industrial applications [ 5] ( Figure 1).
