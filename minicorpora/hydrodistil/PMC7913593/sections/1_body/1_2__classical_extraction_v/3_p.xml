<p>Another “
 <italic>green solvent</italic>” is carbon dioxide, which can be used as the main solvent for supercritical fluid extraction, having advantages such as non-toxicity and thermodynamic parameters, which facilitates its use in the supercritical state [
 <xref rid="B45-ijms-22-01521" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], being a suitable solvent first for non-polar molecules (lipids, terpenes, etc.), followed by more polar molecules [
 <xref rid="B46-ijms-22-01521" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In the case of 
 <italic>Salvia officinalis</italic> L., Jokić and coworkers optimized a supercritical CO
 <sub>2</sub> extraction method for terpenes and phenolic compounds, obtaining increased yields of recovery (7.4%) by varying the utilized pressure (15 or 20 MPa) [
 <xref rid="B33-ijms-22-01521" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] in only 90 min of extraction; meanwhile, Miguel and collaborators, through hydro-distillation obtained in 180 min a decreased yield of recovery (2%) [
 <xref rid="B34-ijms-22-01521" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Moreover, the quality of the obtained compounds can be modified depending on the extraction method used; Ollanketo and coworkers demonstrated that pressurized hot water extraction is a highly promising alternative to conventional solid–liquid techniques, in terms of final application of the recovered compounds; the highest antioxidant activities did not correspond to the maximum recovery yields, but the antioxidant activity was highest when pressurized hot water (PHW) was used as the extracting solvent instead of the maceration method [
 <xref rid="B35-ijms-22-01521" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In this case, the quality of the compounds is influenced by the extraction conditions, in which an increased time and temperature lead to a decrease of biological effects of the obtained compounds. In addition, some compounds do not respond to a classical or modern solvent (such as NADES) extraction, and it is necessary to optimize an enzymatic process and break hydrogen or hydrophobic bonding, which keeps them trapped in the polysaccharide–lignin network [
