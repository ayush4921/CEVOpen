These strains were obtained from the School of Medical Instrument and Food Engineering, University of Shanghai for Science and Technology (Shanghai, China), and stored in glass ampoules at −80 °C prior to use. In this test, nutrient broth (NB), potato dextrose agar (PDA), lauryl sulfate tryptose broth (LSTB), Czapek dox agar (CDA), yeast extract dextrose chloramphenicol agar (YEDCA) and modified Czapek dox broth (MCDB) medium were used as culture media, and there were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.
