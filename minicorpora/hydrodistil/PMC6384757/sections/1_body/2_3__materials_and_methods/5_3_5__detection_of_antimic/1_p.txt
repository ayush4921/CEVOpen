0: The agar disc diffusion assay was carried out to evaluate the antimicrobial activities of the essential oils with different extraction methods.
1: Briefly, 100 L aliquot of microbial inocula in the exponential growth phase (cell concentration of 10 510 6 CFU/mL) were spread over the plate surfaces.
2: The three essential oils were dissolved in 1% dimethyl sulfoxide to 25 L/mL.
3: Four sterile test discs ( = 6 mm) were placed onto each agar plate and then injected with 10 L essential oil individually.
4: Negative control was prepared using 1% dimethyl sulfoxide and the antibiotic amoxicillin was used as positive control at the concentration 50 g/mL.
5: The plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 C for bacteria and for 48 h at 30 C for yeasts.
6: Full diameter of the zone was regarded as the inhibition zone diameter, which was read by eye and measured by ruler.
7: The tests were performed in four replicates for each sample.
