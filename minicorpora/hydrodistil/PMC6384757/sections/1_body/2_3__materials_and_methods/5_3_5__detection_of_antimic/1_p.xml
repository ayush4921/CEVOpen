<p>The agar disc diffusion assay was carried out to evaluate the antimicrobial activities of the essential oils with different extraction methods. Briefly, 100 μL aliquot of microbial inocula in the exponential growth phase (cell concentration of 10
 <sup>5</sup>–10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU/mL) were spread over the plate surfaces. The three essential oils were dissolved in 1% dimethyl sulfoxide to 25 µL/mL. Four sterile test discs (Ф = 6 mm) were placed onto each agar plate and then injected with 10 μL essential oil individually. Negative control was prepared using 1% dimethyl sulfoxide and the antibiotic amoxicillin was used as positive control at the concentration 50 μg/mL. The plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C for bacteria and for 48 h at 30 °C for yeasts. Full diameter of the zone was regarded as the inhibition zone diameter, which was read by eye and measured by ruler. The tests were performed in four replicates for each sample.
