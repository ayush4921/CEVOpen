<p>The subcritical extraction system (shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00483-f006">Figure 6</xref>) was provided by Henan Subcritical Biological Technology Co., Ltd. (Henan, China). In this study, 100 g ground 
 <italic>A. argyi</italic> sample was loaded into the extraction cell. Butane from the storage pot (No. 1) was passed to refrigerator to be cooled and liquefied. Then liquefied butane was pressurized by the compressor (No. 7). Subsequently, compressed butane was passed into the solvent bottle (No. 4) and then transferred to the extraction agent (No. 2). In the shell-and-tube heat exchanger, water was circulated in its shell with constant temperature, providing the required temperature for extraction. The operation time was determined for all experiments by closing the extraction agent (No. 2) valve for about 5 h. The obtained essential oil was collected carefully from knockout drum (No. 3). Because the essential oil was sensitive to light and heat, it was carefully weighed and kept in a sealed murky vial in an ice box before analysis. According to the reported method [
