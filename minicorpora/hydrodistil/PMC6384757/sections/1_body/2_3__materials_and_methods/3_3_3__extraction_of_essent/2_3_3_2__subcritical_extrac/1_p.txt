0: The subcritical extraction system (shown in  Figure 6) was provided by Henan Subcritical Biological Technology Co., Ltd. (Henan, China).
1: In this study, 100 g ground  A. argyi sample was loaded into the extraction cell.
2: Butane from the storage pot (No.
3: 1) was passed to refrigerator to be cooled and liquefied.
4: Then liquefied butane was pressurized by the compressor (No.
5: 7).
6: Subsequently, compressed butane was passed into the solvent bottle (No.
7: 4) and then transferred to the extraction agent (No.
8: 2).
9: In the shell-and-tube heat exchanger, water was circulated in its shell with constant temperature, providing the required temperature for extraction.
10: The operation time was determined for all experiments by closing the extraction agent (No.
11: 2) valve for about 5 h. The obtained essential oil was collected carefully from knockout drum (No.
12: 3).
13: Because the essential oil was sensitive to light and heat, it was carefully weighed and kept in a sealed murky vial in an ice box before analysis.
14: According to the reported method [ 23], the experiment was repeated three times.
