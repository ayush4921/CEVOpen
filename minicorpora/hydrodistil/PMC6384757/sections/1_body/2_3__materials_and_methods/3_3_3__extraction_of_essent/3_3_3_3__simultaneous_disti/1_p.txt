0: Simultaneous distillation-extraction of  A. argyi essential oil was performed with a specially designed equipment (shown in  Figure 7).
1: Ground  A. argyi sample (100 g) was loaded into the flask (extraction agent, No.
2: 2) with 1500 mL deionized water, and coupled with another flask (No.
3: 9) which contained 30 mL hexane.
4: The operating temperatures of thermostats No.
5: 1 and 10 were set at 100 C and 45 C respectively.
6: The extraction system was performed for 3 h. Afterwards, the valve (No.
7: 8) was turned on, and the continuously condensed distillate was collected in the receiver (No.
8: 11).
9: The essential oil and hexane were separated by a rotary evaporator.
10: Subsequently, the extract was weighed and stored at 4 C. On the basis of the reported method [ 24], the experiment was repeated three times.
