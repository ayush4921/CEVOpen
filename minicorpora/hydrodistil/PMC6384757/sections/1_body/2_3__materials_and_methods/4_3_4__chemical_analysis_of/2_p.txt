0: Samples were analyzed by GC-MS and the data were analyzed using the MetAlign TM.
1: Software (version 3.0, Wageningen University, 2011,  http://www.MetAlign.nl).
2: In this untargeted approach, the software was used to align and compare full scan GC-MS chromatograms and assess possible difference between samples.
3: Raw data from GC-MS chromatograms were imported into MetAlign TM, and baseline correction, denoising and smoothing of the data were carried out.
4: This was achieved by setting parameters in the MetAlign TM interface, where the minimum peak threshold to eliminate noise that would interfere with peak alignment, was determined.
5: Spectral alignment was performed using the rough mode, where ion fragments originating from chromatographic peaks with corresponding retention times were aligned across all samples.
