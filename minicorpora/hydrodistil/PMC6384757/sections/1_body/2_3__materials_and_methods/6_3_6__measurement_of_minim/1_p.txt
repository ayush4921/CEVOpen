0: The three essential oils were first dissolved in 1% dimethyl sulfoxide and diluted to 50.000, 25.000, 12.500, 6.250, 3.125, and 1.562 L/mL respectively.
1: Then 1 mL of each diluted sample was mixed with 14 mL of PDA culture medium and poured into a sterile petri dish.
2: Subsequently, 1 mL culture medium was inoculated onto the potato dextrose agar plates and incubated for 48 h at 28 C. The growth of the strains was monitored and the assay was performed in triplicate.
3: The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of the essential oil at which the microorganism tested did not demonstrated visible on the plates [ 25].
