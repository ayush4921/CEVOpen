<p>The three essential oils were first dissolved in 1% dimethyl sulfoxide and diluted to 50.000, 25.000, 12.500, 6.250, 3.125, and 1.562 µL/mL respectively. Then 1 mL of each diluted sample was mixed with 14 mL of PDA culture medium and poured into a sterile petri dish. Subsequently, 1 mL culture medium was inoculated onto the potato dextrose agar plates and incubated for 48 h at 28 °C. The growth of the strains was monitored and the assay was performed in triplicate. The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of the essential oil at which the microorganism tested did not demonstrated visible on the plates [
