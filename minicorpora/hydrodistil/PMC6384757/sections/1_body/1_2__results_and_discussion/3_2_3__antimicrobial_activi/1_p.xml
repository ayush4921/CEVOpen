<p>The antimicrobial activities of 
 <italic>A. argyi</italic> essential oils determined by the agar disc diffusion assay are listed in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-00483-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. In general, Gram-positive pathogens were much more sensitive to 
 <italic>A. argyi</italic> essential oil than fungi and Gram-negative pathogens. 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> was the most sensitive bacterium, with an inhibition diameter longer than 15 mm and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> was the most inhibited Gram-negative bacterium with an inhibition diameter longer than 9.7 mm. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00483-f002">Figure 2</xref>, hydrodistillation oil showed strong inhibition against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, whereas subcritical extraction oil showed significant inhibition against 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and 
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, with inhibition zone diameters of 21.88 and 14.7 mm, respectively.
