<p>Taking both of the results from MICs and inhibition zone diameter into consideration, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> were the appropriate target bacteria with higher sensitivity. To further investigate the antimicrobial activity of the extracted essential oils, SEM analysis was performed using the two selected sensitive bacteria. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00483-f004">Figure 4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00483-f005">Figure 5</xref>, the images directly exhibited the detrimental inhibitory effect of the essential oil from 
 <italic>A. argyi</italic> against the tested bacteria. It could be found that, for the most part, control cells were intact and showed a smooth surface or weakly damaged (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00483-f004">Figure 4</xref>(A4) and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00483-f005">Figure 5</xref>(B4)). In contrast, bacterial cells treated with the 
 <italic>A. argyi</italic> essential oils were subjected to considerable damage (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00483-f004">Figure 4</xref>(A1–A3) and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00483-f005">Figure 5</xref>(B1–B3)). Similar results have been reported by Diao et al. [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-24-00483" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. These results revealed that the active compounds from essential oil might bind to the cell surface and then penetrate into the target sites, which could destroy the structure of cell walls. It should be noticed that, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00483-f004">Figure 4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-00483-f005">Figure 5</xref>, the cell walls changed much to different extents after treated with the essential oil, while SDE oil showed the strongest inhibitory effect against the strains.
