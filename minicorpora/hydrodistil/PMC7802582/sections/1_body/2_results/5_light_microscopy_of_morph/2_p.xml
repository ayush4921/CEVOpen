<p>The effects of increasing concentrations of 
 <italic>D. kotschyi</italic> essential oil treatment on 
 <italic>T. gondii</italic> in Vero cells were investigated by light microscopy (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32021-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). It shows the morphological effects of RPMI‐1640, positive control, and essential oil of 
 <italic>D. kotschyi</italic> on Vero cell and 
 <italic>T. gondii</italic>‐inoculated Vero cells. The number of tachyzoites decreased sharply from 1 µg to 1,000 µg of essential oil compared to the positive and negative control. The test was performed on tachyzoites from peritoneal exudates using Giemsa staining. Considerable numbers of the collected tachyzoites from all treated subgroups were reduced (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32021-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Microscopic observation of intracellular parasite postinfection treatment was performed. Treatment of infected cells with 
 <italic>D. kotschyi</italic> essential oil, treatment with the positive control, and negative control are shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32021-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. Vero cells showed no remarkable morphological changes.
