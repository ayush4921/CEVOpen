0: Tachyzoites of  T. gondii RH strain were maintained by intraperitoneal passages in Balb/c mice and collected in phosphatebuffered saline (PBS), pH 7.2, at 34 day intervals.
1: Peritoneal fluid was obtained from the infected mice and centrifuged for 10 min at 200  g at room temperature.
2: This centrifugation removed host cells and debris.
3: Subsequently, the supernatant containing the parasites was collected and centrifuged for 10 min at 1,000  g. The pellet was washed in two stages, first with PBS at pH 7.2 and then RPMI1640 (Gibco, USA) without bovine fetal serum.
