0: Vero cell culture (2 x 10 5 cells/ml) was carried out on a glass slide in a 35 mm cell culture dish up to the confluence and then infected with 1  10 6 tachyzoites/well.
1: After 4 hr incubation, the monolayers were washed with Hanks' Balanced Saline Solution (HBSS; Gibco Inc., USA), followed by the addition of the essential oil contained in RPMI1640.
2: The glass lids were removed from the dishes at 48 hr after adding the essential oil, pyrimethamine, sulphadiazine, and 1% DMSO (negative control).
3: All glass slides were washed with HBSS and fixed with methanol before staining with Giemsa (Sigma Inc., USA).
4: The samples were observed under an oilimmersion objective lens at a magnification of 1,000  by an optical microscope.
5: A camera and software were used to capture the images (ShengXia et al.,  2008).
