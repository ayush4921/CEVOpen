0: An Agilent 7890A GC coupled with an Agilent 5975C mass detector with triple quadrupole mass analyzer and electronic ionization (EI) was used for the GC analysis of the essential oil.
1: The gas chromatograph was prepared with an HP5 GC capillary column (30 m  0.25 mm; film thickness 0.25 m).
2: The oven temperature was started from 50 oC, held for 2 min, raised by 8oC/min up to 250C, followed by 250330C by 3oC/min with the total run time of 58 min.
3: The carrier gas was helium was at a flow rate of 2 ml/min.
4: The temperature used for the injector and the detector is 280C.
5: The parameters for MS were as follows: ion source temperature (230C), mass range (50700), ionization voltage (70 Ev).
6: The MSD ChemStation was used as operating software.
7: A comparison of mass spectra and retention times with literature data helped to identify compounds (Javidnia et al.,  2005).
