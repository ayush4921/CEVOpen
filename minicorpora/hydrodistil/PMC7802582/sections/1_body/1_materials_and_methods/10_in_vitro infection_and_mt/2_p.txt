0: Vero cells were used for this step.
1: The cells were obtained by exponential growth.
2: 3  10 5 parasites/ml was deposited in each well to have a final volume of 200 l (Belloni et al.,  2003).
3: The infected cells were then washed with RPMI1640 FBSfree medium (twice), six hours after inoculation, to remove extracellular parasites.
4: After incubation for 18 hr, 100 l of RPMI1640 medium with 2% FBS were added to each well with different concentrations of essential oil/pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine (to a final concentration of 11000g) (ShengXia et al.,  2008).
5: The treatment lasted 24 hr, the anti T. gondii activity and the cytotoxicity of the essential oil were determined by a thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT) method in 96well plates (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA).
6: The essential oil was added to the cell line.
7: After 24 hr, the MTT solution was added to the cells, and the presence of purple matrices was analyzed using a plate reader.
8: All data points represent the average of three independent experiments.
9: The mean inhibitory concentration (IC 50) was determined based on the concentration of extracts, controls, and essential oil that successfully inhibited 50% of the  T. gondii tachyzoites.
10: Selectivity is the mean IC 50 value for Vero cells relative to the mean IC 50 value for  T. gondii (Park et al.,  2003).
