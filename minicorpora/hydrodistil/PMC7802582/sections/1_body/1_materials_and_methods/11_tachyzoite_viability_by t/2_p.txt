0: Tachyzoite viability test was permed, in vitro using the method proposed by Cover and Gutteridge (Cover & Gutteridge,  1982).
1: 45 l of tachyzoite suspension containing 10 6 cells/ml and  D. kotschyi essential oil at six different concentrations (1, 10, 50, 100, 500, and 1000g) in 96well microplates are brought together.
2: The whole is incubated at 37C.
3: After 30, 90, and 180 min incubation in 5% CO 2 at 37C, a trypan blue dye exclusion test for tachyzoites is carried out under an inverted microscope.
4: Results were expressed as % viability.
5: Positive controls consisted of 96well plates containing pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine at a concentration of 100 mg/ml, while PBS were the negative controls.
6: The plates were then spread on a glass slide followed by an examination under an optical microscope.
7: The experiments were repeated three times.
