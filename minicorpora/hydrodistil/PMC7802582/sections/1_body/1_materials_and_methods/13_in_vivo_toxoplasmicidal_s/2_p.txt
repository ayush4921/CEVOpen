0: For in vivo determination of anti Toxoplasma activity, 60 female Balb/c mice between 4 and 6 weeks of age were used.
1: The animals received an intraperitoneal (IP) injection of  T. gondii RH (2  10 4 tachyzoites) and then divided into 6 groups of 10 mice (Ebrahimzadeh et al.,  2017).
2: After inoculation, batch treatment was immediately started and continued for 5 days at regular 24hr intervals as follows: essential oil (200, 100, and 50 mg/kg1/day1), pyrimethamine (25 mg/kg1/day1), PBS (negative control), and sulfadiazine (500 mg kg 1 day 1) (positive control).
3: Regular daily monitoring of the mice was carried out throughout the experiment.
4: Unusual observations and deaths of the mice were recorded.
5: To avoid side effects of the drugs used, the experiment was preceded by a preliminary study in which Balb/c mice were given the same dose of drugs.
6: No clinically significant toxicity or mortality was observed.
