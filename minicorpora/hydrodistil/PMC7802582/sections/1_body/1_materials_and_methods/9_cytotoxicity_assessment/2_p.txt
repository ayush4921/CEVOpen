0: The cytotoxicity of the essential oil was evaluated on Vero cells with a modification of the MTT test (SigmaAldrich, USA) with 3(4, 5dimethylthiazol2yl)2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide, described by Mosmann (Mosmann,  1983), using 96well plates.
1: 6  10 4 cells/mL of Vero cells were inoculated into each well previously containing 100L growth medium.
2: Incubation at 37oC followed in an incubator moistened with 5% CO 2 for 24 hr.
3: After this incubation, the Vero cells were treated with extracts of  D. kotschyi at different concentrations: 1,000, 500, 100, 50, 10, and 1 g. Each concentration was added to each respective 96well plate.
4: Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine (reference drugs used in the treatment of toxoplasmosis) were used as positive controls while RPMI1640 was used as a control buffer.
5: After 24 hr, the supernatant was removed.
6: 100 l of the MTTPBS solution (5 mg/ml) in RPMI1640 in a 1:9 ratios in each well.
7: The plate was then covered with aluminum foil and incubated for 4 hr in a 37o C incubator.
8: The medium was then discarded, and 100 l of DMSO was added to each well to solubilize the dark blue MTT formazan salt.
9: The optical density was measured at an absorbance of 570 nm using a Dynex microplate reader.
