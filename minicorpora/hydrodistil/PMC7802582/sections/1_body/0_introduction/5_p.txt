0: Although several scientific works have demonstrated the potential medicinal effect of  D. Kotschyi essential oil on several pathogens, few data are available about its antiparasitic activity.
1: Some flavonoid isolated from  D. Kotschyi essential oil had trypanocidal properties on  Trypanosoma cruzi epimastigotes (Gohari et al.,  2003), but there is, to our knowledge, no data relating to the antiToxoplasma properties of the plant.
2: Given the therapeutic failure and severe side effects of the synthetic drugs available against many pathogens, safer therapeutic options must be explored.
3: Incidentally, the use of essential oils to control parasitic pathogens could be useful in the fight against various infectious diseases.
4: Here, we studied the activity of  D. Kotschyi essential oil against  T. gondii tachyzoites.
