0: The treatment of toxoplasmosis involves antiparasitic drugs that act primarily against the tachyzoite form; they do not eradicate the encysted (bradyzoite) stage.
1: The most effective agent is the pyrimethamine, which is used in most drug regimens (Dunay et al.,  2018).
2: However, leucovorin must be given concomitantly to prevent bone marrow suppression.
3: The efficacy of trimethoprim, azithromycin, dapsone, clarithromycin, contrimaxole, atovaquone, and sulfamethoxazole is unclear; therefore, it is recommended that they are used only in combination with pyrimethamine (Dunay et al.,  2018; Rajapakse et al.,  2013).
4: Of the available combinations, the most effective include pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine or trisulfapyrimidines.
5: However, these combinations have many side effects that hamper their use.
6: Hypersensitivity reactions, megaloblastic anemia, bone marrow damage, and agranulocytosis are inevitable in many cases (De La Torre et al.,  2014; Guaraldo et al.,  2018).
7: Therefore, it is necessary to find new, less toxic drugs for the treatment of this infection.
