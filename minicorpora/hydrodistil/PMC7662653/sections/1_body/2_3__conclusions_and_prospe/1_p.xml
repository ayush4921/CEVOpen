<p>Overall, 
 <italic>Molecules</italic> is strongly committed to publish green insecticide research. Peculiar attention is devoted to studies shedding light on the modes of action and non-target toxicity of natural substances of plant origin. Studies about the development of novel formulations (including nano-objects) to boost the effectiveness and stability of green insecticides under real-world conditions represent major advances in this research field. Of note, the impact of sub-lethal doses of green insecticides on insect behavioral traits is still overlooked, representing a timely and important challenge for further research.
