0: The structures of the natural compounds were minimized using a conjugate gradient AMMP incorporated in VEGA ZZ [ 58].
1: The conversion of the file from PDB to PDBQT was done using AutoDockTools1.5.2.
2: We applied AutoDock Vina software with an exhaustiveness parameter of 32 to perform the docking simulations [ 59].
3: ADT was used for the docking conformation analysis.
4: Receptor ligand interactions were visualized by Discovery Studio Visualizer (Dassault Systemes BIOVIA, 2015) [ 60].
