0: Interactions between the natural compounds and human peroxiredoxin 5 were assessed by in silico molecular docking, in order to explore the preferred orientation of the ligands in the binding site of receptors.
1: The crystal structure was obtained from the Protein Data Bank: human peroxiredoxin 5 (PDB Code: 1HD2).
2: All water molecules were removed, as was the co-crystallized ligand from the structures.
3: Polar hydrogens and Gasteiger charges were assigned with AutoDockTools1.5.2 (ADT), and the PDBQT file format was prepared [ 57].
4: The same software was used to select a docking grid.
5: In human peroxiredoxin 5 enzyme (PDB: 1HD2), the grid box site was established at 7.611, 43.828, and 29.921A ( x,  y, and  z, respectively) using a grid of 70, 58, and 58 points ( x,  y, and  z, respectively) and including a spacing of 0.375 A.
