0: The -carotene bleaching test was performed based on the experimental protocol done by Kadri et al.
1: [ 8].
2: Briefly, a mixture containing 20 L of linoleic acid and 200 mg of Tween 20% (emulsifier) was added to a previously prepared solution by dissolving 0.2 mg of -carotene in 1 mL of chloroform.
3: After vacuum evaporation of the chloroform at 40 C, a volume of 50 mL of oxygen sparged water was added to the obtained emulsion.
4: Then, a volume of 5 mL of this emulsion was introduced into a tube containing 0.5 mL of the sample or BHT (reference synthetic antioxidant).
5: Control solutions have been prepared in parallel.
6: The antioxidant activity was determined according to the optical density of the sample at 470 nm against a control solution prepared as above, but devoid of -carotene.
