0: The chemical composition of  P. cubeba fruits essential oil has been identified using a GCMS apparatus (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), as described by Bakari et al.
1: [ 55].
2: The column used is an HP5MS (5% phenyl) of length 30 m, inside diameter 0.25 mm, and film thickness 0.25 m. The temperature of the injector and detector was 250 C. The oven temperature was maintained at 100 C for 1 min, then increased to 260 C at a rate of 4 C/min, and then maintained at 260 C for 10 min.
3: Helium gas has been used as a carrier gas at a constant rate of 1 mL/min.
4: The injection volume was 1 L. Ionization conditions by impact electronics (EI) were at an ionic energy of 70 eV and a range of swept mass of 50 to 550  m/ z.
