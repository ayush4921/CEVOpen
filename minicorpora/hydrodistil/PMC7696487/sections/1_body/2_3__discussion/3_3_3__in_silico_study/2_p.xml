<p>As stated above from the docking results, we found that they are in perfect agreement with those obtained by Declercq et al. [
 <xref rid="B53-plants-09-01534" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] when analyzing the crystal structure of human peroxiredoxin 5 (1HD2). The authors demonstrated that at the active site of the enzyme, the residue Cys47 located at the N-terminal part of the kinked helix α2, inside a small cavity, was directly involved in peroxide reductase activity by forming an intramolecular disulfide intermediate in the oxidized enzyme. Also, the amino acid Arg127, interacting with the sulfur atom of Cys47 at a distance of 3.3 Å, seems to be responsible for the positively charged active site pocket. On the other hand, Thr44 is present in the active site cavity of human peroxiredoxin 5, with its oxygen atom clearly interacting with the sulfur atom of the catalytic cysteine residue (Cys47) at a distance of 3.0 Å. In addition, they found that one side of the active site pocket contains several hydrophobic residues, including Leu116, Ile119, and Phe120, whose side-chains are located near the benzoate aromatic ring, which is shown to act as hydroxyl radical scavenger (via its benzoate ion). As shown, numerous interactions between human peroxiredoxin 5-selected phytocompounds are close to the active site of the enzyme. Our finding also corroborates perfectly those of Eze et al. [
