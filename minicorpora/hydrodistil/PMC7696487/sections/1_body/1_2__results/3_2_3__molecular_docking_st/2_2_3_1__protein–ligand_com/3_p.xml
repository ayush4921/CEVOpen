<p>From our molecular docking results, it was found that β-caryophyllene oxide was identified as the most potent inhibitor of the enzyme, with human peroxiredoxin 5 interacting favorably with its catalytic site via two H-bonding interactions with Gly46 (2.73) and Arg127 (6.35); five van der Waals interactions with Pro40, Thr44, Cys47, Ile119, and Thr147; and four Alkyl/Pi–Alkyl interactions with Pro45 (3.75), Leu116 (4.31) (4.68), and Phe120 (4.89). Isocembrol compound performed several hydrophobic interactions with the following residues of human peroxiredoxin 5 (1HD2): one H bond with Thr147 (2.61), five van der Waals interactions with Thr44, Gly46, Ile119, Arg127, and Gly148l and five Alkyl/Pi–Alkyl interactions with Pro40 (4.03), Pro45 (3.87) (4.31), Leu116 (4.50), and Phe120 (5.31) amino acid residues. The interactions involved between α-selinene and human peroxiredoxin 5 are van der Waals interactions with Ala42, Thr44, Asn76, Phe120, and Arg124; Pi-Sigma interactions with Phe43 (3.80); and Alkyl/Pi–Alkyl interactions with Phe43 (5.26) and Val80 (4.19) (4.56). Thr147 (2.86) formed one H bond with a viridiflorol OH group. Other forms of interactions that were established included van der Waals reactions with Gly46, Cys47, Phe120, and Arg12; C–H bonds with Thr147 (3.28); and Alkyl interactions with Pro45 (4.75), Leu116 (4.13) (4.42) (5.43), and Ile119 (5.10) residues.</p>
