<p>As one of the best filters in the virtual screening of bioactive molecules, in order to be an effective drug in early preclinical development, the forecasting of ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) profiles of the selected compounds, including their pharmacokinetic and drug-like properties, have been investigated using Swiss ADME (

 <sub>o/w</sub> in the range 2.25–4.75. Their bioavailability score of 0.55 indicates their more drug-like properties. Noticeably, there is no P-glycoprotein (P–gp) substrate justifying their good intestinal absorption and bioavailability; the compounds exhibited high gastrointestinal absorption (GI) (except α-selinene), and only isocembrol and α-selinene were predicted to not cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB). However, the others easily pass the blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeant, and can bind to specific receptors. The study’s components interacted at most with two isoenzymes of the Cytochrome P (CYP) family, confirming their better effectiveness with insignificant toxicity.
