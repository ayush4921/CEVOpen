0: Medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs), in their entirety or their separated parts, are used as they are or can be further processed by extraction of essential oils and are considered an important resource in various fields, such as pharmaceutical, flavor and fragrance, perfumery, and cosmetic industries [ 1].
1: Essential oils from medicinal and aromatic plants are a very interesting source of secondary metabolites because of their many different biological properties, such as cytotoxic [ 2], anti-inflammatory [ 3], antioxidant [ 4], insecticidal [ 5], antifungal [ 6] and antimicrobial [ 7, 8, 9], many of which are of increasing interest in the field of human and animal health.
2: In recent years, the development of antibiotic resistance represents the major issue in medical microbiology and the search for new weapons against antibiotic resistances has led to the search of new sources of potential antimicrobials.
3: Among them, the plant kingdom offers a wide range of biodiversity with a great value for the pharmaceutical industry.
4: In Tunisia and in other North African countries, MAPs in human and veterinary medicine are mainly used for respiratory and intestinal infections in children, and in the treatment of gastric pains, diabetes, hypertension, diarrhea and rheumatism [ 10, 11, 12, 13].
5: The genus  Tetraclinis is part of the Cupressaceae family and unspecific, consisting of only  Tetraclinis articulata (Vahl) Masters (synonyms:  Thuja articulata Vahl,  Callitris quadrivalvis Vent), commonly known as Barbary thuja.
6: This species is widespread across the North African region.
7: In Tunisia, this coniferous tree is located in the northeastern region of the country [ 14].
8: Previous studies on this species indicated its use as an antibacterial and antifungal [ 13, 15, 16], cytotoxic [ 17], antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent [ 18].
9: The essential oils isolated from some  Tetraclinis articulata organs (nonwoody branches, wood branches, wood, cones, roots, leaves, fruits and seeds) so far have exhibited wide variability in their major compounds, the most commonly encountered ones being monoterpene hydrocarbons, such as -pinene in leaves, fruits and cones (Algeria and Tunisia) [ 19, 20, 21] and camphene in wood branches and roots (Tunisia) [ 22], followed by oxygenated monoterpenes such as camphor and bornyl acetate in roots, leaves, nonwoody branches and wood branches (Malta, Algeria and Tunisia) [ 16, 23, 24].To date, no reports have been published on the chemical and cytotoxic activity of the trunk bark essential oil of  T. articulata (HEE).
10: Our aim was thus to isolate the essential oils of HEE from northeast Tunisia by steam distillation, and fractionate these by normal phase silica chromatography and assess the fractions for cytotoxic activity [ 25].
