0: The composition of HEE and its five fractions was determined by Gas Chromatography/Electron Ionization-Mass Spectrometry (GC-EI-MS).
1: Analyses were carried out with a Varian CP-3800 gas chromatograph (Varian Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA) fitted with an HP-5 capillary column (30 m, 0.25 mm, 0.25 m film thickness) coupled with a Varian Saturn (Varian Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA) 2000 ion-trap mass detector.
2: Operating conditions were as follows: injector temperature, 220 C; transfer line temperature, 240 C; oven temperature, 60 to 240 C (set to a 3 C/min increment), carrier gas: helium at a 1 mL/min flow.
3: After dilution (5%) in HPLC-grade  n-hexane, 1 L was injected in the GC (split ratio 1:30).
4: The acquisition was performed with the following parameters: full scan, with a scan range of 35300  m/ z; scan time: 1.0 s; threshold: 1 count.
5: The identification of the constituents was based on the comparison of their retention times (t R) with those of pure reference samples and of their linear retention indices (LRIs), which were determined relative to the t R of a series of  n-alkanes (C 9C 25).
6: The mass spectra detected were compared with those listed in the commercial libraries NIST 14 and ADAMS, and in a homemade mass-spectral library, built from pure substances and components of essential oils of known composition and MS literature data [ 38, 39].
