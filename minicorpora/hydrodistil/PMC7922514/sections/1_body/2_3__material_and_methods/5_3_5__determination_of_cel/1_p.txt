0: Cells were seeded into a 96-well plate 5  10 31  10 4 cells per well.
1: The next day, cells were challenged for 48 h with increasing concentrations of the essential oil and its fractions for 48 h. After the indicated times, cells were washed with PBS and then stained with crystal violet (0.5%  w/ v) for 5 min and then rinsed three times with water.
2: Absorbance was read at 540 nm after extraction of the dye with 0.1 M sodium citrate in 50% ethanol.
3: The inhibitory concentrations of 50% (IC 50) were calculated using a four-parameter nonlinear regression with GraphPad Prism version 6 software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA).
4: The chemotherapeutical drug 5-fluorouracil was used as positive control [ 40].
