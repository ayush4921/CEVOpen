0: Trunk bark of  T. articulata (750 g) was cut into little pieces and subjected to steam distillation over 4 h using a Clevenger-type system.
1: The essential oil (HEE) obtained was decanted, dried over anhydrous Na 2SO 4 and stored in sealed glass vials at 45 C until chemical and biological analysis.
2: The essential oil (300 mg) was fractionated on a column of silica gel using a hexane/ethyl acetate step gradient (95:5; 90:10; 80:20; 70:30) to afford five fractions (E.1E.5): fraction E.1 (137 mg, 45.7% of oil); fraction E.2 (37 mg, 12.4% of oil); fraction E.3 (28 mg, 9.4% of oil); fraction E.4 (22 mg, 7.4% of oil); fraction E.5 (46 mg, 15.4% of oil).
3: These fractions (E.1E.5) were also submitted to gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry.
