 <caption> Histopathological observation of renal tissue of control, ACEO, chlorpyrifos, and vitamin C stained with hematoxylin and eosin viewed at original magnification (Ã—400). (A) Control kidney showing normal architecture; (B) ACEO alone administered rats showing normal architecture in renal tissue; (C) CPF kidney sections revealed tubular epithelial degenerations, focal necrosis of renal tubules, vacuole formations and reduction of glomerular space after chlorpyrifos treatment; (D) ACEO + CPF showed that ACEO co-administration restored renal tissue alteration induced by chlorpyrifos; (E) VitC alone treated rats showed normal architecture in kidney tissue; and (F) VitC + CPF showed that vitamin C co-administration restored renal tissue damage induced by chlorpyrifos. </caption>
