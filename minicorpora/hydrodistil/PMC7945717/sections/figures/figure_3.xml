  <p>Histopathological observation of renal tissue of control, ACEO, chlorpyrifos, and vitamin C stained with hematoxylin and eosin viewed at original magnification (Ã—400). 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Control kidney showing normal architecture; 
   <bold>(B)</bold> ACEO alone administered rats showing normal architecture in renal tissue; 
   <bold>(C)</bold> CPF kidney sections revealed tubular epithelial degenerations, focal necrosis of renal tubules, vacuole formations and reduction of glomerular space after chlorpyrifos treatment; 
   <bold>(D)</bold> ACEO + CPF showed that ACEO co-administration restored renal tissue alteration induced by chlorpyrifos; 
   <bold>(E)</bold> VitC alone treated rats showed normal architecture in kidney tissue; and 
   <bold>(F)</bold> VitC + CPF showed that vitamin C co-administration restored renal tissue damage induced by chlorpyrifos.
