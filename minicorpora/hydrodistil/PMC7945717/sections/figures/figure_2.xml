  <p>Histopathological observation of rat hepatic tissue of control, ACEO, chlorpyrifos, and vitamin C stained with hematoxylin and eosin viewed at original magnification (Ã—400). 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Control liver showing normal architecture; 
   <bold>(B)</bold> ACEO alone administered rats showing normal architecture in liver tissue; 
   <bold>(C)</bold> CPF liver sections showed abnormal cellular morphology accompanied by sinusoidal dilatation, congestion, ballooning, necrosis, vacuole formations, and degeneration of hepatocytes after chlorpyrifos treatment; 
   <bold>(D)</bold> ACEO + CPF co-treated rats indicating protected hepatic tissue; 
   <bold>(E)</bold> VitC alone treated rats showed normal architecture in liver tissue; and 
   <bold>(F)</bold> VitC + CPF showed that vitamin C co-administration restored liver tissue alteration induced by chlorpyrifos.
