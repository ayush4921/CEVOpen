<p>Serum creatinine, uric acid, and urea indicators of kidney function increased significantly in rats after CPF treatment which may indicate degradation of both purines and pyrimidines and impaired kidney function. Many reports investigated an increase of creatinine, urea and uric acid in serum of rats exposed to toxic compounds including pesticides (

 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Kasteel et al., 2020</xref>). Levels of serum cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, and glucose were statistically enhanced in rats exposed to CPF. Our results corroborates with the studies of 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">El-Demerdash and Nasr (2014)</xref>, which demonstrated that diazinon disrupted several biochemical parameters including lipid profile. In fact, it is believed that lipids (particularly the unsaturated fatty acids which belong to the main components of the cell membranes) belong to the most sensitive molecules to oxidizing stress. Many reports showed significant changes in lipids profile in both blood and tissues of experimental animals exposed to pests (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">García-García et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Rahmouni et al., 2019</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Badraoui et al., 2020</xref>). On the other hand, this enhancement of serum cholesterol in rats treated with CPF may be due to liver damage that can be attributed to the effect of CPF on the permeability of liver cell membrane. Our study showed that all the serum hepatic, and renal lipid profile markers, and the blood glucose were restored to normal levels in the CPF + ACEO and CPF + VitC groups. This may be due to the antioxidant activities (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Saoudi et al., 2017b</xref>) of the bioactive components of ACEO. Recent reports were performed on the antioxidant activities of essential oil of 
 <italic>A. campestris</italic> and its effects on many biological studies (antioxidant, vasorelaxant, antiplatelet, anticancer, anti-acetylcholinesterase,…). In the current study, the perturbations of the biochemical parameters (hepatic markers, kidney markers, lipid profile, and blood glucose) were associated with an oxidative damage in rats’ livers and kidneys after treatment with CPF. Our results revealed that CPF treatment caused oxidative stress in the liver and kidney of rats, which was associated with the generation of lipid peroxidation (LPO). The overproduction of LPO disturbed the integrity of cellular membranes and implicated in the pathogenesis of liver and kidney injuries (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Badraoui et al., 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Joshi et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Saoudi et al., 2018</xref>). For this reason, it has been used as an indicator of pesticides induced oxidative stress (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Badraoui et al., 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Hemalatha et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Mzid et al., 2017</xref>). The present results demonstrated that the administration of CPF caused statistically increases in the level of liver and kidney LPO and decreases in antioxidant activities such as SOD, CAT, and GPx. These findings are consistent with previous studies, which indicated that CPF and other pests caused oxidative damage confirmed by a decrease in the levels of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, and GPx), and increase in the level of LPO (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Mansour and Gamet-Payrastre, 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Amri et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Saoudi et al., 2017a</xref>). The increase of LPO and decreases in SOD, CAT, and GPx activities observed in hepatic and kidneys tissues following CPF exposure could probably be explained by an excessive production of ROS, which could be related to hepatocyte and kidney enzymes leakage (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Narra et al., 2017</xref>). The present results are in accordance with those of 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Mosbah et al. (2016)</xref> who demonstrated a significant increase in LPO level and decreases of SOD, CAT, and GPx activities in plasma and testis after treatment of male rats with CPF. In fact, CPF can be responsible for increasing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells, which lead to increased lipid peroxidation levels and oxidative damage (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Kasteel et al., 2020</xref>). The decrease in antioxidant enzyme activities in liver and kidney tissues was due to cellular injury and death of healthy cells that are able to respond to the oxidative insult. On the other hand, it may be due to the insufficient detoxification capacity of CPF and damage caused by ROS (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Amri et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Kutluyer et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Mzid et al., 2017</xref>). SOD, CAT, and GPx activities, as antioxidant enzymes, play an important role in the protection against the deleterious effects of LPO by scavenging superoxide anions and hydroxyl ions. ACEO was also reported to combat effects of many toxins, including pesticides and heavy metals (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Badraoui et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Houicher et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Saoudi et al., 2017a</xref>). In our experiment, pre-administration of ACEO or vitamin C against CPF resulted in an increase in the activities of SOD, catalase and GPx in the liver and kidney tissues of rats. Preventive treatment with ACEO also restored the MDA level suggesting decrease in lipid peroxidation. These properties could be attributed to the high levels of antioxidants such as phyocyanin, carotenoids, vitamins, minerals, lipids, proteins and carbohydrates, which have been reported in 
 <italic>A. campestris</italic> (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Dib et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, ACEO could be used to prevent hepatic and renal diseases especially those induced by oxidative damage (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Saoudi et al., 2017a</xref>). The changes in oxidative stress, liver, and kidney biomarkers in rats exposed to the CPF corroborated the histopathological lesions observed in this study. In fact, the liver histological observations revealed sinusoidal dilatation, congestion, ballooning, necrosis, vacuole formations, and degeneration of hepatocytes after CPF treatment. The present findings are in consequence with the results of previous investigations after exposure to different types of insecticides (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Badraoui et al., 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Singh et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Rahmouni et al., 2019</xref>). The kidney histological examinations revealed tubular epithelial degenerations, focal necrosis of renal tubules, vacuole formations, and reduction of glomerular space after CPF treatment. Histological observations of the kidneys of CPF treated rats were comparable with other studies conducted on deltamethrin treated rats (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Saoudi et al., 2017a</xref>). The observations in the previous mentioned studies are in corroboration and support our results. The marked changes in the overall histoarchitecture of the liver and kidney in response to CPF could be attributed to the toxic effects of the insecticide through the excessive generation of ROS, causing damage to various membrane components of the hepatic and renal tissues.
