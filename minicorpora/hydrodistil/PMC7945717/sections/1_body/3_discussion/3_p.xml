<p>ACEO co-administration ameliorates the histological alterations induced by CPF, suggesting an efficient antiradical/antioxidant of ACEO. Moreover, our results are in accordance with earlier studies that postulated the beneficial role of ACEO on the histopathological and biochemical changes in rats (
