<p>In the current study, rats exposed to CPF exhibited increases of serum AST, ALT, ALP, and LDH activities, which could be a consequence of hepatic tissues injury. The increase of these liver biomarkers within the serum is usually indicating damage in both liver morphology and function (

Moreover, the elevation of serum transaminases (AST and ALT) following CPF treatment disturbed not only the synthesis of energetic macromolecules, which are needed for several vital and metabolic functions but also the detoxification processes (
