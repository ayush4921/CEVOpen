 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> show histopathological findings and attributed scores for both liver and kidneys in all the experimental rats. Liver tissue sections revealed sinusoidal dilatation, congestion, ballooning, necrosis, vacuole formations, and degeneration of hepatocytes after chlorpyrifos treatment. Both ACEO and vitamin C restored back the liver histological alterations, which were induced by CPF. However, the control and the rats treated with ACEO or vitamin C showed normal architecture of the hepatic lobule (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Renal tissue sections revealed tubular epithelial degenerations, focal necrosis of renal tubules, vacuole formations and reduction of glomerular space after chlorpyrifos treatment. Here again, ACEO and vitamin C co-administration alleviated renal histological alterations which were induced by CPF. However, the control rats and the treated rats with ACEO and vitamin C showed normal architecture of the renal parenchyma (
