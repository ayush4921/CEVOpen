<p>Levels of AST, ALT, ALP, and LDH in the different group of rats are given in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Statistical increases of serum AST, ALT, ALP, and LDH in rats exposed to CPF (8.42, 17.46, 22.9, and 25.19%, respectively) compared with control rats. Significant decreases in the levels of serum AST, ALT, ALP and LDH in ACEO plus CPF (ACEO + CPF) rats (3.59, 9.42, 24.9, and 19.76%, respectively) compared with CPF rats. The levels of serum AST, ALT, ALP, and LDH were statistically unchanged in rats treated with ACEO and vitamin C as compared with controls. Levels of serum creatinine, urea, uric acid, cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL, LDL and glucose in control and treated rats are shown in
