<p>After 2 weeks of treatments, the rats were sacrificed by decapitation under general anesthesia. Serum samples were collected from the blood of each rat by centrifuging at 2,700 g for 15 min. Both kidneys and livers were also collected. For each rat, kidney and liver specimens were homogenized with a Potter (glass-teflon) in the presence of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The homogenates were centrifuged at 4°C at 10,000 g for 15 min using Ultra Turrax (T25, Germany). Aliquots of serum and tissue supernatants were kept at −30°C until analyzed.</p>
