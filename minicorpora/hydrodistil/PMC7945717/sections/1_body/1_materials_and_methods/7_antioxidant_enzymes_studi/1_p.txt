0: Colorimetric methods were used to determine the levels of different enzymatic antioxidants.
1: SOD activity was assessed using the oxidizing reaction of nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) as previously reported by  Beyer and Fridovich (1987).
2: CAT activity was measured using H 2O 2 as reported by  Aebi (1984).
3: GPx activity was measured using H 2O 2 as substrate and reduced GSH as published by  Flohe and Gunzler (1984).
