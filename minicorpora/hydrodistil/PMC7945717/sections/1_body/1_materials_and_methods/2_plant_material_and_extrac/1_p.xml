 <italic>A. campestris</italic> aerial parts (stem and leaves) were collected from Kasserine (Central region of Tunisia). Small pieces of the plant were subjected to 2 h hydro distillation using a Clevenger-type apparatus. The oil phase was extracted and run three successive times using diethyl ether, then dried using a vaccum. The extracted essential oil was then purified and stored until further use.
