<p>Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), as an indicator of lipid peroxidation, were studied in the liver and kidney tissues as described by 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Buege and Aust (1978)</xref>. Overall, a mixture composed of 200 mL of tissue extracts, 250 mL of TCA-BHT (20%TCA and BHT 1%) and 150 mL of TBS (Tris 50 mM, NaCl 150 mM, pH 7.4) was vortexed and then centrifuged for 10 min at 1,500 rpm. To 400 mL of the supernatant, 320 mL of Tris–TBA (Tris 26 mM and TBA 120 mM) and HCl 0.6 N were added. Later on, the mixture was heated for 10 min at 80°C then the absorbance was read at 530 nm. The extinction coefficient of 1.56 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> mM
