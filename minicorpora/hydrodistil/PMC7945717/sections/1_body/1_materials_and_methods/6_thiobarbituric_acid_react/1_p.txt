0: Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), as an indicator of lipid peroxidation, were studied in the liver and kidney tissues as described by  Buege and Aust (1978).
1: Overall, a mixture composed of 200 mL of tissue extracts, 250 mL of TCA-BHT (20%TCA and BHT 1%) and 150 mL of TBS (Tris 50 mM, NaCl 150 mM, pH 7.4) was vortexed and then centrifuged for 10 min at 1,500 rpm.
2: To 400 mL of the supernatant, 320 mL of TrisTBA (Tris 26 mM and TBA 120 mM) and HCl 0.6 N were added.
3: Later on, the mixture was heated for 10 min at 80C then the absorbance was read at 530 nm.
4: The extinction coefficient of 1.56  10 5 mM 1 cm 1 was used to determine the level of TBARS.
