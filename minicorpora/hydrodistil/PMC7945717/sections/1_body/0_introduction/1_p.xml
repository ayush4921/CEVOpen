<p>Pesticides are commonly used to control insects, fungal diseases, and weeds to protect the world’s food supply. They are particularly used in agriculture to protect crops, but also in many other professional activities (maintenance of green spaces, wood treatment, disinfection of premises, veterinary uses.) as well as for domestic uses (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">de Bon et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, humans are differently exposed to pesticides; either directly in agricultural occupations or indirectly through the consumption of contaminated food (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Badraoui et al., 2007</xref>;

The appearance of these molecules (pesticides), generally more effective against pests than the inorganic molecules that preceded them (copper sulfate, lime.). Hence, these products have made interesting progress in the quality and quantity of crops and in the fight against disease vectors (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Donkor et al., 2016</xref>). However, their wide diffusion and toxic potential raised several questions about their risks to human health. Pesticides may enter the body when the product is mixed, applied or cleaned. Also, pesticides can enter the body via the three major routes of exposure: inhalation, ingestion, and skin contact through the lungs, the mouth, and the dermal contact, respectively. Pesticides pose a real public health problem (

 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Mzid et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Rahmouni et al., 2019</xref>). Indeed, the effects of low amounts of pesticides, in mixture, for long periods pose many health problems. Recent studies showed that people exposed to pesticides are more likely to develop cancer, congenital malformations, infertility problems, neurological problems or weakened immune systems than others (

 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Sharma and Chadha, 2016</xref>). The active substance in CPF induces a disruption of nervous system function by inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), an enzyme that degrades the acetylcholine (Ach) neurotransmitter in both neuromuscular junctions and cholinergic synapses (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Abolaji et al., 2017b</xref>). The AChE enzyme is common to many animals which confers on OPs a relative selectivity. For this reason, the activity of CPF is not limited to insects. For example, OPs are very dangerous to ecosystems (invertebrates and fish), even at very low doses. The neurotoxic effects of CPF are related to the cholinergic function, which in turn induces hyperactivity in the cholinergic synapses (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Albuquerquea et al., 2017</xref>). These neurotoxic effects are not related to CPF itself but to its main metabolite; the chorpyifos-oxon. The latter is well-known to bind to the enzyme acetylcholinesterase and blocking/disabling its activity within the nervous synapses (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Abolaji et al., 2017a</xref>,
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>). Also, CPF produces many other damaging effects, such as embryo- and geno- toxicity, immunological disruptions, hepatic failure, teratogenicity and neurobehavioral changes (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Burke, 2016</xref>). Recently, many studies demonstrated that oxygen free radicals play an important role in the pesticides’ toxicity (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Asghari et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Mzid et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Rahmouni et al., 2019</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Badraoui et al., 2020</xref>). It has been reported in an experimental study, that CPF produced oxidative damage associating accumulation of lipid peroxidation products in several organs (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Tanvir et al., 2016</xref>). CPF may differentially change the activity of the cell antioxidants such assuperoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and catalase (CAT). Thus, could result in of oxidative stress damage in various organ systems. Recent study by 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Narra et al. (2017)</xref> reported that CPF significantly decreased the activities of these antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, and GPx). Such effects of CPF might associate the perturbation of the normal cellular development and/or differentiation (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Dominah et al., 2017</xref>). Repeated exposure to CPF caused significant hepato-renal toxicity. In fact, several disruptions in profile of both liver and kidney markers have been reported. Together with this, essential trace elements and antioxidant enzymes were found to be adversely affected in CPF intoxicated animals (
