0: Pesticides are commonly used to control insects, fungal diseases, and weeds to protect the worlds food supply.
1: They are particularly used in agriculture to protect crops, but also in many other professional activities (maintenance of green spaces, wood treatment, disinfection of premises, veterinary uses.)
2: as well as for domestic uses ( de Bon et al., 2014).
3: Indeed, humans are differently exposed to pesticides; either directly in agricultural occupations or indirectly through the consumption of contaminated food ( Badraoui et al., 2007;  Negatu et al., 2016;  Mzid et al., 2017).
4: The appearance of these molecules (pesticides), generally more effective against pests than the inorganic molecules that preceded them (copper sulfate, lime.).
5: Hence, these products have made interesting progress in the quality and quantity of crops and in the fight against disease vectors ( Donkor et al., 2016).
6: However, their wide diffusion and toxic potential raised several questions about their risks to human health.
7: Pesticides may enter the body when the product is mixed, applied or cleaned.
8: Also, pesticides can enter the body via the three major routes of exposure: inhalation, ingestion, and skin contact through the lungs, the mouth, and the dermal contact, respectively.
9: Pesticides pose a real public health problem ( Badraoui et al., 2007,  2020;  Mzid et al., 2017;  Rahmouni et al., 2019).
10: Indeed, the effects of low amounts of pesticides, in mixture, for long periods pose many health problems.
11: Recent studies showed that people exposed to pesticides are more likely to develop cancer, congenital malformations, infertility problems, neurological problems or weakened immune systems than others ( Sears et al., 2006;  Badraoui et al., 2007,  2012;  Mzid et al., 2017).
12: Chlorpyrifos (CPF) is one of the most widely used organophosphorus (OP) in the world for both agriculture and indoor applications ( Sharma and Chadha, 2016).
13: The active substance in CPF induces a disruption of nervous system function by inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), an enzyme that degrades the acetylcholine (Ach) neurotransmitter in both neuromuscular junctions and cholinergic synapses ( Abolaji et al., 2017b).
14: The AChE enzyme is common to many animals which confers on OPs a relative selectivity.
15: For this reason, the activity of CPF is not limited to insects.
16: For example, OPs are very dangerous to ecosystems (invertebrates and fish), even at very low doses.
17: The neurotoxic effects of CPF are related to the cholinergic function, which in turn induces hyperactivity in the cholinergic synapses ( Albuquerquea et al., 2017).
18: These neurotoxic effects are not related to CPF itself but to its main metabolite; the chorpyifos-oxon.
19: The latter is well-known to bind to the enzyme acetylcholinesterase and blocking/disabling its activity within the nervous synapses ( Abolaji et al., 2017a, b).
20: Also, CPF produces many other damaging effects, such as embryo- and geno- toxicity, immunological disruptions, hepatic failure, teratogenicity and neurobehavioral changes ( Burke, 2016).
21: Recently, many studies demonstrated that oxygen free radicals play an important role in the pesticides toxicity ( Asghari et al., 2017;  Mzid et al., 2017;  Rahmouni et al., 2019;  Badraoui et al., 2020).
22: It has been reported in an experimental study, that CPF produced oxidative damage associating accumulation of lipid peroxidation products in several organs ( Tanvir et al., 2016).
23: CPF may differentially change the activity of the cell antioxidants such assuperoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and catalase (CAT).
24: Thus, could result in of oxidative stress damage in various organ systems.
25: Recent study by  Narra et al.
26: (2017) reported that CPF significantly decreased the activities of these antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, and GPx).
27: Such effects of CPF might associate the perturbation of the normal cellular development and/or differentiation ( Dominah et al., 2017).
28: Repeated exposure to CPF caused significant hepato-renal toxicity.
29: In fact, several disruptions in profile of both liver and kidney markers have been reported.
30: Together with this, essential trace elements and antioxidant enzymes were found to be adversely affected in CPF intoxicated animals ( Abolaji et al., 2017a).
