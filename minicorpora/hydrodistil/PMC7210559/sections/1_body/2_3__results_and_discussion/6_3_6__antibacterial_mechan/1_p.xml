 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>shows the microbial cells before and after treatment with 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic> essential oil. The cell appearances were changed upon treatment, likely through altering outer cell envelopes. The untreated 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> cells have their typical striated wall structures (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(a)</xref>), and the differences between the control cells and the treated ones can be easily observed in the rod morphology (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(b)</xref>). It seems that the essential oil of 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic> has the ability to disrupt the membrane of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> cells and facilitate intracellular compounds leakage, as indicated by the presence of malformed and sunken cell shapes. In fact, the essential oil resulted in a high cell disruption and subsequently greater cell lysis degrees in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. The strained wall structures of 
 <italic>L. innocua</italic> cells were changed after treatment with the essential oil, as well (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(c)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(d)</xref>). The oil caused deformity in the cell surfaces, and the treated 
 <italic>L. innocua</italic> cells had wrinkled and irregular cellular shapes.
