<p>The cells were exposed to increasing doses of the essential oil ranging from 1 to 200 mg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup> for 24 h. The essential oil had a concentration-dependent growth-inhibition effect on AT-MSCs, and the antiproliferative activity of the oil was increased markedly as its concentration increased up to 200 mg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The IC
 <sub>50</sub> value for the antiproliferative effect of the oil on AT-MSCs was calculated to be 83.51 mg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>. It seems that low concentrations of 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic> essential oil are able to induce cell proliferation and are beneficial for AT-MSC growth, besides having an outstanding antioxidant activity and strong bactericidal effect (at MBC &lt; 50 mg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) against all pathogenic and spoilage bacteria tested in this study.
