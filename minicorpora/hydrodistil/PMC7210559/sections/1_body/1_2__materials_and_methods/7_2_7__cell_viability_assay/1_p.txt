0: Antiproliferative effect of the essential oil against AT-MSCs was analyzed in 96-well flat-bottom plates using MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide] assay, utilizing the method of Yousefi et al.
1: [ 17] with some modification.
2: AT-MSCs from healthy donors were obtained and (1  10 5 per well) were seeded in the plates until 5060% confluence was obtained, followed by replacing the medium with 2 mL of complete culture medium (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium + fetal bovine serum) and adding different concentrations of the oil (1, 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, 100, and 200 mgmL 1) into each well.
3: The plates were incubated for 24 h, and cell proliferation was then quantified by MTT assay.
4: Each well was loaded with 30  L of 5 mgmL 1 MTT solution, and the plates were incubated in a CO 2 incubator for 3 h. The medium was discarded gently, and the wells were charged with 200  L of dimethyl sulfoxide.
5: The absorbance of the mixture was finally read at 570 nm using an ELISA reader (Convergent Technologies, Marburg, Germany).
