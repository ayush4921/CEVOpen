0: The chemical compounds of  C. zeylanicum essential oil were identified by a GC coupled with a mass spectrometer (TRACE MS, Thermo Finnigan) with a DB-5 capillary column (30 m  0.25 mm, 0.25  m stationary phase thickness).
1: The column temperature was increased from 40C to 250C with the heating rate of 2.5Cmin 1.
2: Helium was applied as the carrier gas, and the ionization energy was 70 eV.
3: The retention indices and mass spectra of the constituents of the essential oil were compared with the published data in the literature, followed by calculation of the retention indices using a homologous series of n-alkane (C 8-C 20) indices [ 9,  10].
