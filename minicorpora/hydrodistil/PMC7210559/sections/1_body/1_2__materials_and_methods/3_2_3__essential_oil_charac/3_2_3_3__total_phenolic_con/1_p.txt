0: The TPC of  C. zeylanicum essential oil was determined by means of FolinCiocalteu reagent based on a method described by Abeysekera et al.
1: [ 11].
2: 20  L of the essential oil was added to 110  L of freshly prepared FolinCiocalteu reagent (10-time diluted) which was followed by adding sodium carbonate solution (70  L), incubating at ambient temperature for 30 min, and recording its absorbance at 765 nm.
3: Gallic acid (0.061 mgmL 1) was used to formulate the standard curve, and the TPC of the essential oil was then expressed as mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/g dry weight  C. zeylanicum bark.
