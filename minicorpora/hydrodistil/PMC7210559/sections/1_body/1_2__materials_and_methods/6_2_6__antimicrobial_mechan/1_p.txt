0: According to the MIC results,  L. innocua and  E. coli were selected as the most sensitive and resistant bacteria to the essential oil, respectively, in order to investigate the antimicrobial mechanism action of the oil on their cell membranes.
1: The bacterial strains were cultured in a broth medium containing MIC of the oil for each bacteria, while the medium being shaken at 37C.
2: The microbial suspension was centrifuged (5000 g for 5 min) to separate the bacterial strains, followed by washing the strains twice by 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7) and filtration using polycarbonate filters.
3: Glutaraldehyde solution (2.5% v/v) was then used to fix the filtrate, and the solution was incubated at 4C for 120 min.
4: Double distilled water was applied to wash the sample, and ethanol (at increasing concentrations of 30%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, and 100%) was successively used to dehydrate the sample for 10 min.
5: Afterwards, the sample was vacuum dried to evaporate ethanol, coated with gold, and analyzed by means of a scanning electron microscopy apparatus (LEO 1450 VP model, Germany) to check the morphology of the bacterial strains upon treatment with the essential oil [ 16].
