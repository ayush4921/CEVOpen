0: Firstly, the sequential concentrations of the essential oil (100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.125, 1.562, 0.78, and 0.39 mgmL 1) were prepared in MHB medium and sterilized using 0.45  m syringe filters.
1: Each concentration (200  L) of the oil was added to the wells (in 96-well plates) which were previously filled with 20  L of microbial suspensions.
2: After incubation of the plate at 37C for 24 h, triphenyltetrazolium chloride solution (5%, 20  L) was added and the plate was reincubated.
3: The lowest concentration of the oil with microbial growth-suppression effect, indicated by the lack of dark-red color in the wells, was considered as the MIC.
