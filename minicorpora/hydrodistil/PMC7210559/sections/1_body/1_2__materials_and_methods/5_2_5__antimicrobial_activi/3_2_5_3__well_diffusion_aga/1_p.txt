0: In this assay, the microbial suspension was spread onto MHA medium in Petri dishes using a L-shaped spreader.
1: Afterwards, several wells (6 mm in diameter) were created on the medium surface and loaded with the essential oil (20  L).
2: The Petri dishes were kept at a constant temperature of 37C for 24 h, and the diameter of the inhibition zones around the wells was measured and expressed in millimeters [ 13].
