<p>All lyophilized bacterial strain cultures used in this study were 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> ATCC 25923, 
 <italic>Listeria innocua</italic> ATCC 33090, 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> ATTC 14579, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> ATCC 27853, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> ATCC 25922, and 
 <italic>Salmonella typhi</italic> ATCC 6539. They were subcultured in MHB for 24 h at 37°C under sterile conditions. The obtained stock culture was then subcultured in slant nutrient agar and washed several times with sterile ringer solution to prepare fresh microbial suspension. The optical density (at 630 nm) of the suspension was adjusted to provide a microbial suspension with 0.5 McFarland standard or 1.5 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/mL.
