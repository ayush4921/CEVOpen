0: An aliquot of 37.5  L of the essential oil or methanol (control sample) was charged and mixed with 2 mL of the DPPH methanolic solution (10 4 M).
1: The samples were incubated in the dark for 20 min followed by measuring their absorbance at 517 nm against methanol.
2: The following equation was used to calculate the DPPH radical scavenging activity of the essential oil [ 12]: (1)DPPH radical scavenging activity % =1sample absorbance control absorbance100.
