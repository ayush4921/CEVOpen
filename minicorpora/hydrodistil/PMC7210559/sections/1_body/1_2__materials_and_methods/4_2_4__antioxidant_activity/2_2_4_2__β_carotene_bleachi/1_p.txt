0: The procedure of Ribeiro-Santos et al.
1: [ 10] was used to perform this assay.
2: 1 mL of  -carotene solution (2 mg  -carotene in chloroform) was mixed with Tween 40 (200 mg) and linoleic acid (20 mg).
3: The chloroform was evaporated by vacuum drying of the mixture at 40C and then oxygenated ultrapure water (50 mL) was added.
4: Afterwards, the solution was vigorously shaken to form a linoleic acid/ -carotene emulsion, which (5 mL) was subsequently incorporated with the essential oil (200  L).
5: The resultant mixture was heated in water bath for 120 min, and its absorbance was then recorded at 470 nm (A S120).
6: The control sample was prepared according to the same procedure, but methanol was used instead of the essential oil.
7: The absorbance of the control sample was also recorded at 470 nm before (A C0) and after 120 min (A C120) incubation time.
8: The antioxidant activity of the oil was then calculated using the below equation: (2)antioxidant activity %=AS120AC120AC0AC120100.
