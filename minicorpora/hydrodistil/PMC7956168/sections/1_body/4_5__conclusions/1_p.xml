<p>This study concludes that the essential oil of 
 <italic>T. serrulatus</italic> ameliorated Cd-induced renal impairment, which was possibly mediated by improvement in the altered biochemical and oxidative stress parameters in addition to improvement in the histological structures. Furthermore, 
 <italic>T. serrulatus</italic> might be an appropriate agent to be developed in the future for renal protection and kidney-related disorders.
