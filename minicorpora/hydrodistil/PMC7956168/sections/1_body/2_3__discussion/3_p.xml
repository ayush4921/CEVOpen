<p>In the present study, it has been observed that Cd exposure results in kidney damage by enhancing the lipid peroxidation and disturbing the natural antioxidant system, thus indicating increased oxidative stress. Observed findings suggest that TSA oil could prevent Cd-induced changes in antioxidant-related variables in rats. These findings are in agreement with those of Kawamoto et al. [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-26-01252" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], who reported an increased lipid peroxidation after Cd exposure. Earlier studies reported that chronic Cd exposure resulted in diminished nonenzymatic (tissue GSH) antioxidants [

 <xref rid="B41-molecules-26-01252" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], who described reduced renal GSH content in Cd-intoxicated rats. The decreased GSH contents might be due to its consumption in the prevention of lipid peroxidation caused by oxidative stress [

 <xref rid="B43-molecules-26-01252" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. However, our findings disagree with those of Kamiyama et al. [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-26-01252" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], who described an elevated level of renal GSH in Cd-treated rats. Lipid peroxidation and antioxidant level in Cd-treated rats were significantly modulated with TSA oil administration, indicating a decrease in ROS, a rebalancing of the antioxidant defense system, or both. These findings corroborate those of an earlier study that described the ameliorative effect of thymoquinone against chemical-induced renal injury [
