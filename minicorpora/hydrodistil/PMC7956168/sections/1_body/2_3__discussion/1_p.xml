<p>In the environment, heavy metals are usually present and are prone to absorption, oxidation, and interference with the fate of cells. Particularly, Cd is a natural industrial compound that causes numerous toxic and hazardous impacts, including nephrotoxicity, on human health [

 <xref rid="B32-molecules-26-01252" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Its deposition in various organs causes oxidative stress that weakens the function of the native antioxidant system and, as a result, leads to the development of various severe pathological diseases [
