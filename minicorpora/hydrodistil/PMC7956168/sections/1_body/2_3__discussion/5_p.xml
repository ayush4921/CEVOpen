<p>Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is highly expressed in inflammatory conditions and infections. Thus, it is a vital component of the adaptive response of the host to noxious stimuli. It was reported earlier that Cd-induced renal injury is mediated by nitric oxide synthesis by iNOS stimulation [
