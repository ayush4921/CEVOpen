<p>Right kidney sample tissues fixed in 10% neutral formalin were managed in a tissue processing machine (ASP300s, Leica Biosystems, IL, USA); each sample was embedded in paraffin wax and sliced into 4–5-µm-thick sections. Three sections of each group were chosen and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) dye, periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) stain, and Masson’s trichrome (MT) stain [

All the sections of tissue were analyzed using a microscope (Olympus BX 52) for histopathological description which was recorded by a histopathologist, blinded to the experimental groups. Olympus DP21 camera fixed over the microscope was used for taking photographs.
