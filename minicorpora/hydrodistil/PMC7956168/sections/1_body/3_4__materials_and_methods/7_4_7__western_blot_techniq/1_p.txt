0: Western blot analysis and protein extraction were performed as mentioned in the previous study [ 55].
1: Kidney tissues were minced and the homogenate was prepared in a protease inhibitor mixture and cold protein lysis buffer [ 55].
2: To isolate the total proteins, the tissue lysates were preserved in ice for 60 min, with alternative vortexing (after 10 min), continued with the centrifugation at 12,000  g (4 C, 10 min).
3: The method of Lowry et al.
4: [ 56] was followed to determine the total protein.
5: For Western blot analysis, protein (2550 g) was briefly isolated from each group and shifted to nitrocellulose membranes obtained from Bio-Rad USA.
6: Immediately blocking of protein blots was done at 4 C (for 24 h); after that, incubation with primary antibodies against NF-B p65, iNOS, and Smad2 and peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies at room temperature was performed.
7: The proteins were analyzed with the help of a chemiluminescence detection kit (GE Health Care, Mississauga, Canada).
8: Protein band intensity was normalized to beta-actin bands using the ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, USA).
9: Images were captured with a C-Digit chemiluminescent Western blot scanner obtained from LI-COR, USA.
