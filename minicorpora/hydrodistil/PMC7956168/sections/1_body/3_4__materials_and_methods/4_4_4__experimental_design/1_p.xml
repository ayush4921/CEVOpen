<p>For the assessment of the nephroprotective effect of TSA oil against Cd-induced toxicity, rats were randomly allocated into five groups (
 <italic>n</italic> = 6). Group 1 (normal control) received physiological salt solution (0.9% NaCl) daily for 7 days. Group 2 (toxic control) received cadmium chloride (3 mg/Kg, IP, 7 days). Group 3 (positive control) was coadministered CdCl
 <sub>2</sub> and silymarin (100 mg/kg, PO) for 7 consecutive days. Groups 4 and 5 were coadministered CdCl
 <sub>2</sub> and TSA oil at doses of 100 and 200 mg/Kg (PO, 7 days), respectively. The dose of CdCl
 <sub>2</sub> was selected based on previously reported literature [
