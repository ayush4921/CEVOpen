0: For the assessment of the nephroprotective effect of TSA oil against Cd-induced toxicity, rats were randomly allocated into five groups ( n = 6).
1: Group 1 (normal control) received physiological salt solution (0.9% NaCl) daily for 7 days.
2: Group 2 (toxic control) received cadmium chloride (3 mg/Kg, IP, 7 days).
3: Group 3 (positive control) was coadministered CdCl 2 and silymarin (100 mg/kg, PO) for 7 consecutive days.
4: Groups 4 and 5 were coadministered CdCl 2 and TSA oil at doses of 100 and 200 mg/Kg (PO, 7 days), respectively.
5: The dose of CdCl 2 was selected based on previously reported literature [ 19, 52].
