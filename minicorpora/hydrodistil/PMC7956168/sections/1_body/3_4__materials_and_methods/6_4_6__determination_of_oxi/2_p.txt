0: MDA lipid peroxidation marker was estimated by using a previously described method [ 53].
1: Briefly, 0.25 mL of homogenate was incubated at a temperature of 37 C for 1 h in a metabolic shaker.
2: After incubation, 0.5 mL of 0.67% thiobarbituric acid (TBA) and 0.5 mL of 5% ( w/ v) chilled trichloroacetic acid (TCA) was added, followed by centrifugation (1000  g, 15 min).
3: Thereafter, the supernatant was kept in a boiling water bath for 10 min.
4: The absorbance developed was measured at 535 nm, i.e., pink color observed.
