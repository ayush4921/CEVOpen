0: For GSH, the Jollow et al.
1: [ 54] method was followed.
2: Briefly, after precipitation of 1 mL PMS with 1 mL of sulfosalicylic acid (4%), the test samples were incubated (4 C, 1 h), followed by centrifugation (1200  g, 15 min, 4 C).
3: The assay mixture contained supernatant (0.1 mL), phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.4) (1.7 mL), and dithio-bis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB) (0.4% in phosphate buffer, 0.1 M, pH 7.4) (0.2 mL) in a total volume of 2.0 mL.
4: The absorbance of samples was analyzed at 412 nm within 5 min after the addition of DTNB to the reaction mixtures.
