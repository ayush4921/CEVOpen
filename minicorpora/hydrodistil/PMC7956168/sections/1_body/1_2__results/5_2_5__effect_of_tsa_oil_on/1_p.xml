<p>Histopathological analysis of the control group rats showed normal kidney histological architecture with normal convoluted tubules, glomerulus, and Bowman capsule with normal space as well as the normal status of collagen fiber and periodic acid–Schiff (PAS)-positive materials such as basement membrane (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-01252-f004">Figure 4</xref>). Photomicrographs of the toxic group show abnormal glomeruli (G), degeneration (D) and necrosis (N) of convoluted tubules, and degenerated and almost absent Bowman space. Abnormal convoluted tubules indicate histological disruption (T), blocked by damaged tissue (B) and necrosis. Photomicrograph of Masson’s trichome (MT)-stained toxic group shows increased collagenic materials (C). Moreover, the photomicrograph of the PAS-stained toxic group shows abnormal deposition of PAS-positive materials (P) that displaced the parenchyma of the kidney; it also shows weakness or loss of intact basement membrane (L). Treatment with TSA oil at a low dose reinstated the normal glomeruli and normal convoluted tubules, although there was still slight suffering from toxic effects in the form of blocking tubules (B) and little increased collagenic material (C), as well as abnormal deposition of PAS-positive materials (P). Treatment with TSA oil at a high dose gave histological pictures of almost normal histological appearance very near to that of the standard treatment (magnification 400× and scale bar 20 µm for all photomicrographs).
