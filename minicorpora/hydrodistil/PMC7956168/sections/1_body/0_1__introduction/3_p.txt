0: Studies over the past few decades revealed that the maximum probability of renal damage is because of the release of Cd in the cell that provokes oxidative stress [ 9, 10].
1: One of the suggested mechanisms is the disturbance in the natural antioxidant defense system, which further causes the overproduction of oxygen free radicals (OFR) [ 11] and results in decreased glutathione (GSH) levels and, in turn, oxidative stress-related apoptosis [ 12].
2: Out of several reported mechanisms, decreased GSH content and OFR-induced cell damage are mainly responsible for lipid peroxidation [ 13, 14].
