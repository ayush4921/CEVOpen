0: Previous literature also finds that the correlation between oxidative stress and inflammation enhances various renal diseases [ 15].
1: Therefore, it can be suggested that renal toxicity is caused by Cd through complex intracellular signaling pathways which are mainly directed by oxidative stress.
2: Nuclear factor-B (NF-B) controls several inflammatory genes in all types of cells [ 16].
3: NF-B is the main cause of various kidney diseases and can be activated by Cd exposure.
4: Chronic kidney disease has been found in both human and animal models by upregulation of Smad2 proteins [ 9].
5: Earlier studies stated that downregulation of NF-B and Smad2 might be beneficial mechanisms for the anti-inflammatory drugs [ 17].
