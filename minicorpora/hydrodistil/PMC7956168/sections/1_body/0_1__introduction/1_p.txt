0: Environmental chemical exposure remains a major public health problem globally.
1: Exposure to cadmium (Cd), one of the most reactive toxic metals, has increased in the biosphere from both natural and anthropogenic sources [ 1].
2: The Cd exposure is also due to the contamination in soil, air, water, and food, as well as cigarette smoke [ 2].
3: A significantly increased absorption along with decreased excretion rate leads to an increased burden of Cd in different organs.
4: The Cd can damage multiple organs depending on its dose, route, and duration but mainly affects kidneys and causes renal impairment [ 3].
