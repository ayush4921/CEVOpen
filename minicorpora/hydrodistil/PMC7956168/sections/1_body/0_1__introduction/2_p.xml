<p>The kidneys are vital organs in the human body and responsible for various essential functions, including the removal of harmful metabolites, nitrogenous wastes, and some drugs with urine [

 <xref rid="B5-molecules-26-01252" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and causes decreased removal of the toxic chemicals, drugs, or both that lead to acute kidney failure. Moreover, renal injury caused by chronic Cd exposure may lead to chronic kidney failure and if not treated can result in death [

 <xref rid="B7-molecules-26-01252" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Cd accumulation in proximal convoluted tubules obstructs tubular reabsorption and results in polyuria and proteinuria. There have been studies of common abnormal effects of Cd on kidney function, but there is still a lack of detailed information on molecular mechanisms and a need to explore this further [
