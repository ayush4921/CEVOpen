 <caption> The effect of TSA oil on Cd-intoxicated kidney tissues as assessed by histopathological studies with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E), Masson’s trichrome (MT), and periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) staining. Photomicrographs of toxic group show abnormal glomeruli (G), degenerated (D) and necrotic (N) convoluted tubules, degenerated and almost absent Bowman space. Abnormal convoluted tubules indicate histological disruption (T), blocked by damaged tissue (B) and necrosis. Photomicrograph of MT-stained toxic group shows increased collagenic materials (C). Photomicrograph of PAS staining toxic group shows abnormal deposition of PAS-positive materials (P) and loss of intact basement membrane (L) (magnification 400×; scale bar 20 µm). </caption>
