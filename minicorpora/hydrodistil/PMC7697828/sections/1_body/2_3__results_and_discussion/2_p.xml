<p>Examined 
 <italic>Origanum</italic> subspecies cultivated in Poland varied also in terms of leaves parameters. Leaves of common oregano were characterized by higher area of blade than Greek oregano (78.27 and 61.76 mm
 <sup>2</sup>, respectively) (

 <xref rid="foods-09-01671-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). In 
 <italic>Origanum</italic> subspecies (as well as in other Lamiaceae), glandular trichomes are multicellular epidermal glands responsible for storage of essential oil. Two different types of these glands were recognized on the epidermis of 
 <italic>Origanum</italic> species: peltate and capitate glands. The glandular trichomes are built of one basal cell, one stalk cell and a multi-cellular head, where essential oil is synthesized before being transferred to subcuticular area [

 <xref rid="B56-foods-09-01671" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] claim that the location of glandular trichomes have valuable taxonomical significance at the species level. In the present work, the number of glandular trichomes per 1 mm
 <sup>2</sup> was significantly higher when given Greek oregano leaves (4.78 on adaxial and 4.85 on abaxial surface) in comparison to common oregano (0.78 and 1.17, respectively) (
 <xref rid="foods-09-01671-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). This pattern corresponds with studies undertaken earlier by Shafiee-Hajiabad et al. [
 <xref rid="B57-foods-09-01671" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. However, the author showed higher number of glands in both subspecies: up to 17 per 1 mm
 <sup>2</sup> in Greek oregano and up to 9.67 per 1 mm
 <sup>2</sup> in common oregano. This inaccuracy may be related to the phenomenon that the formation of glandular trichomes is variable and can be controlled by both genetic and environmental factors [
