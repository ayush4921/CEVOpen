<p>In the case of culinary herbs, the organoleptic characteristic and their acceptance by consumers are important issues. Unpleasant flavor may be a reason of the rejection of the product, even though its quality meets Pharmacopeia or ISO (International Organization for Standardization) specifications [

Results of sensory analysis, carried out in the present work, indicate on visible differences between odor and taste attributes of common oregano and Greek oregano (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-09-01671-f004">Figure 4</xref>). Following notes were selected for odor: minty, coniferous, turpenic, herbaceous (bitter), oregano-like, majoram-like, sweet, spicy, floral, oil-like and medicinal. General intensity of odor was estimated, as well. When given taste: bitter, pungent, coniferous, astringent, minty, herbaceous, spicy, acidic, sweet and salty attributes were chosen. With regards to odor, it was observed that notes of Greek oregano herb were higher in comparison to common oregano, expect from sweet and floral ones (

However, acidic and salty taste was described at the similar level for herb of both examined subspecies (

 <italic>Origanum</italic> plants, the sensory profile is conditioned mainly by its essential oil content and composition. As it was mentioned before, in our work, common oregano was qualified as mixed sabinyl/cymyl type rich in sesquiterpenes, while Greek oregano as mixed carvacrol/γ-terpinene chemotype (

 <italic>p</italic>-cymene, also may affect its sensory profile. Odor of both substances is regarded as gasoline and citrus, while γ-terpinene is additionally described as herbaceous and turpentine [
