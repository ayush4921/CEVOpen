<p>In the present study, 25 compounds were identified in the common oregano essential oil, forming up to 98.11% of total identified fraction. In the case of Greek oregano, 24 constituents were detected, accounting up to 98.89%. The monoterpenes created the fundamental part in both essential oils, with a domination of monoterpene hydrocarbons comprising up to 53.43% and 53.27%, respectively. In Greek oregano, phenolic monoterpenes were also present in the considerable amounts (up to 32.75%). Carvacrol took the majority of this fraction (up to 32.02%), while monoterpene hydrocarbons part was formed mainly by γ-terpinene (up to 28.00%). The domination of above listed compounds let to qualify investigated Greek oregano essential oil as mixed carvacrol/γ-terpinene chemotype. According to literature data, this subspecies is able to create various chemotypes (pure or mixed), based on the dominant compound, such as: carvacrol, tymol,

In present work it was observed that the percentage share of carvarol in Greek oregano essential oil increased from the beginning of blooming to the beginning of the seed-setting stage of plant’s development (28.35, 32.02% respectively), in parallel with γ-terpinene decrease (from 28.00 to 19.62%) (

 <xref rid="B62-foods-09-01671" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] studies, indicating that phenolic monoterpenes (thymol and carvacrol) and their precursors (γ-terpinene and 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene) show synchronized patterns of variations during vegetation season. Taking into consideration that the synthesis of monoterpenes can be affected by temperature, obtained results may be related to the plant’s physiological response for this climatic parameter [
