<p>Plants belonging to 
 <italic>Origanum</italic> genus (
 <italic>Lamiaceae</italic> family) have been known as culinary and medicinal plants since ancient times. This genus contains 49 taxa belonging to 10 sections. Some species, including 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> L., are rich in essential oil and commonly known as “oregano” [
 <xref rid="B1-foods-09-01671" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> L., an aromatic, perennial sub-shrub, is widely distributed all over Eurasia and North Africa [
 <xref rid="B2-foods-09-01671" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The species is regarded to be extremely variable, both in its morphological features and chemical composition. Given its specific biological character and significant economic importance, 
 <italic>O</italic>. 
 <italic>vulgare</italic> has been placed in the List of Priority Species in Europe [
 <xref rid="B3-foods-09-01671" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. According to the widely accepted taxonomy, six subspecies of 
 <italic>O</italic>. 
 <italic>vulgare</italic> have been recognized [
 <xref rid="B2-foods-09-01671" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B4-foods-09-01671" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Among them, 
 <italic>O</italic>. 
 <italic>vulgare</italic> L. subsp. 
 <italic>hirtum</italic> (Link) Ietswaart so-called Greek oregano, endemic to the Mediterranean area, is cultivated almost all over the world and regarded as the most valuable one [
 <xref rid="B5-foods-09-01671" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Another subspecies important from economic point of view, is 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> L. subsp. 
 <italic>vulgare</italic> (common oregano). It frequently occurs on the region of Northern and Central Europe and is the only representative of 
 <italic>O</italic>. 
 <italic>vulgare</italic> in Poland [
 <xref rid="B6-foods-09-01671" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-foods-09-01671" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The upper, not woody parts of flowering shoots (herb) of both subspecies is commonly used and traded raw material. Besides the range of occurrence, these two subspecies differ in terms of many features, whereas the content and composition of essential oil seems to be the most important, because it determines medicinal properties of the herb and its sensory value [
 <xref rid="B2-foods-09-01671" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Greek oregano is rich in essential oil (about 5%), while common oregano contains less amount (up to 2%) of this substance. Subspecies create few various chemotypes defined on the basis of the dominant compound in essential oil. Greek oregano accumulates mainly phenolic monoterpenes (thymol and carvacrol) followed by its precursors (
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene and γ-terpinene). In turn, common oregano is distinguished by less active biosynthesis of “cymyl” compounds in favor of the bicyclic “sabinyl” (i.a. sabinene, 
 <italic>cis</italic>/
 <italic>trans</italic> sabinene hydrate and its acetates) or acyclic once (i.a., β-ocimene, β-myrcen, linalyl acetate, linalool). This kind of chemotype is often accompanied by high content of sesquiterpenes (i.a. germacrene D, β-caryophyllene and caryophyllene oxide) [

 <xref rid="B18-foods-09-01671" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Both 
 <italic>Origanum</italic> subspecies contain also considerable amounts of non-volatile phenolic compounds such as flavonoids and phenolic acids. Rosmarinic acid followed by caffeic, vanillic, 
 <italic>o</italic>-coumaric and protocatechuic acids dominate in common oregano herb [

 <xref rid="B22-foods-09-01671" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In both subspecies, flavonoids are represented mainly by derivatives of luteoline and apigenine [

 <italic>Origanum</italic> subspecies indicate various pharmacological activities, especially antimicrobial, choleretic and antioxidant. Common oregano herb reveals also diuretic and expectorant properties, while Greek oregano—stimulative, carminative, antispasmodic, and anticancer [

 <xref rid="B26-foods-09-01671" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. It is worth noting that Greek oregano is listed in the European Pharmacopeia and is recommended as a remedy for gastrointestinal disorders treatment, temporary loss of appetite and to stimulate bile secretion [
