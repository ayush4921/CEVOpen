<p>Subcritical water extraction (SCWE), a new and promising extraction method, is safe, fast, economical, and environmentally friendly. This method entails the use of water subjected to high pressure, which raises its temperature to above its normal boiling point. The use of water, as the solvent for the extraction of essential oil, is both cost-effective and environmentally friendly [

 <xref rid="B16-molecules-25-03872" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Previously, the utilization of the SCWE method, for the extraction of essential oil from 
 <italic>Aquilaria crassna</italic>, under subcritical conditions (100, 125, and 150 °C), resulted in a higher yield of 
 <italic>A. crassna</italic> oils in a shorter time period, in comparison to the utilization of hydrodistillation [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-25-03872" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. These findings suggest that in terms of time, yield, and quality, the SCWE method could represent a better alternative to the currently available conventional methods, for the extraction of 
 <italic>A. malaccensis</italic>’ oil. With this in mind, this undertaking delves into the potential of employing SCWE for the extraction of 
 <italic>A. malaccensis</italic> essential oil. To date, no studies have been conducted on the optimization of subcritical water extraction (SCWE) for the extraction of 
 <italic>A. malaccensis</italic> oil from wood. This investigation is aimed at bridging this gap.
