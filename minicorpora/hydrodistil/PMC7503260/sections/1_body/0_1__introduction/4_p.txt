0: Hydro-distillation (HD) and steam distillation are the two common methods employed by industries, for the extraction of essential oil from the wood of  A. malaccensis.
1: However, these conventional methods have been observed to be exceedingly time-consuming [ 9, 10].
2: The essential oil extraction process can extend to as long as 16 h. Other drawbacks associated to these conventional methods include the loss of volatile compounds, low extraction efficiency, degradation of unsaturated compounds, and high energy consumption [ 11].
3: While other extraction methods have been engaged to address these drawbacks, they were also found to be problematic or inefficient.
4: For instance, the supercritical fluids extraction (SFE) method was developed, to reduce the time consumption, and also to improve the extraction efficiency (i.e., higher yield) [ 12].
5: However, this extraction method involves the emission of carbon dioxide, which is detrimental to the environment in terms of the greenhouse effect [ 13].
6: The soxhlet and accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) methods were used to improve the essential oil extraction from  A. Malaccensis [ 10].
7: However, although both these methods appeared to improve the yield of essential oil, they are deemed undesirable due to their use of organic solvents (such as n-hexane).
8: Organic solvents are not only toxic and hazardous, but also economically unappealing when used for the extraction of essential oil.
9: Other methods, such as ultrasound assisted, ohmic heating, and microwave assisted extraction [ 14], have yet to deliver a satisfactory yield.
10: Thus, an innovative extraction method, for addressing the problems mentioned above, remains essential.
