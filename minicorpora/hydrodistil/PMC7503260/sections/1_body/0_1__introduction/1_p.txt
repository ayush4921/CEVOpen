0: Of late, the anti-parasitical, bactericidal, fungicidal, cosmetic, pesticide, food additive, perfumery, and medicinal possibilities of essential oils, has gained much attention globally [ 1].
1: Generally, essential oils derive from secondary metabolites with complex compositions, and the number of components may range from a dozen to several hundred [ 2, 3].
2: They compose of complex mixtures of fairly hydrophobic volatile (around 100 u) to semi-volatile compounds, usually with a strong odour, rarely coloured, soluble in organic solvents, and insoluble in water [ 4].
3: Terpenoids (mono- and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons) and their oxygenated derivatives (hydroxyl and carbonyl), along with aliphatic aldehydes, alcohols, phenols, ethers, aldehydes, ketones, and esters are considered the main components of essential oils [ 1].
