<p>The effectiveness of extraction methods on the wood of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>malaccensis</italic> was assessed through BET surface area and BJH pore size. These tests measure the surface area of the sample, as well as its pore size, by referring to the amount of the N
 <sub>2</sub> gas they absorb. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03872-f007">Figure 7</xref>, the pore size graph of the untreated sample (raw wood sample) is slightly different from that of the wood after extraction by HD and SCWE, in both range and distribution of pore sizes. The pore sizes in the raw wood sample in the range of 300–450 Å vanished following the HD extraction. The pore size of both HD (soaking and extraction) and SCWE changed to 400–950 Å, implying that the rupturing of small pores rendered them larger.
