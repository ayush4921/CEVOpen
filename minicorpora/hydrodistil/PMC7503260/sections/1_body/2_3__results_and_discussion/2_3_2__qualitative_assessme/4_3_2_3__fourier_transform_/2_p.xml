<p>FTIR spectrum of 
 <italic>A. malaccensis</italic> wood after SCWE was observed to be slightly different, from the control and HD spectrum. The intensity of the absorbance bands for cellulose and hemicellulose [

 <sup>−1</sup>(CH

 <sup>−1</sup> (C=O stretch vibration), and 2910 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (C-H stretch). FTIR absorption peak of 897 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> generally corresponds to β (1→4)-glycosidic linkages [
 <xref rid="B53-molecules-25-03872" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The absence of this peak (897 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>) upon treatment of SCWE (at 225 °C) is believed to be due to the breaking of β (1→4)- glycosidic bonds (cellulose to glucose) [
 <xref rid="B53-molecules-25-03872" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. This glucose is then further decomposed into furfural as can be detected by GC/MS results presented previously. Previous workers have demonstrated the use of temperature as high as 250 °C in order to observe significant changes in FTIR of the cellulose sample [
