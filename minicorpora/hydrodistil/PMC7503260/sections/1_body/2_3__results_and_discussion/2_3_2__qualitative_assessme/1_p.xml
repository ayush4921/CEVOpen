<p>Both essential oil and wood samples from HD and SCW treatments were analysed to elucidate the effectiveness of different extraction methods, in terms of essential oil quality and morphological/structural changes. GC/MS was used to analyse essential oils extracted at optimum conditions for both HD (100 °C, 0.1 g/mL, 16 h) and SCWE (156 °C, 0.2 g/mL, 25 min), while raw and treated wood samples were analysed with the utilization of SEM, FTIR, and BET, to ascertain the morphology, chemical structure, surface area, and porosity of the sample. </p>
