<p>Gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS) was used to examine the chemical compositions of 
 <italic>A. malaccensis</italic> wood essential oils, extracted through HD and SCWE, at optimum conditions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03872-f004">Figure 4</xref>). Forty-three chemical components, constituting 92% of dark greenish 
 <italic>A. malaccensis</italic> wood essential oil, extracted by way of HD were identified, while for SCWE, 50 chemical components, constituting 96% of light orange/brownish 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>malaccensis</italic> essential oil were identified (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-03872-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The GC/MS identified n-hexadecenoic acid (17.238%), 2-butanone, 4-phenyl (10.732%), and agarospirol (7.618%) as the major compounds of essential oil extracted by way of hydro-distillation from the wood of 
 <italic>A. malaccensis</italic>, while furfural (14.36%), guaiacol (13.504%), and 2-butanone, 4-phenyl (12.042%) were identified as the major compounds of essential oil derived through SCWE.
