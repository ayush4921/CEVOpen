 <xref rid="molecules-25-03872-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. At low temperatures-short times of extraction, a lower yield was extracted, due to insufficient energy and time for effective breakage of cellulose and hemicelluloses. This circumstance impeded complete extraction as the structure of agarwood is both porous and fibrous. Temperature is a crucial parameter in the SCWE process, as it changes the polarity, dielectric constant, and viscosity of water. As such, temperature determines the capacity of water to perform as effectively as organic solvents [

 <xref rid="B21-molecules-25-03872" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-25-03872" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-25-03872" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The importance of temperature is clearly demonstrated in the results, when a rise in temperature significantly improved the yield. The high temperature and pressure of SCWE decreased the polarity, permittivity, density, surface tension, and viscosity of water to increase its diffusivity. An increase in the waterâ€™s diffusivity improves the mass transfer rate by enhancing the wetting of the matrix. This in turn facilitates a deeper penetration into the matrix particles, to boost the efficiency of the extraction process.
