 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03872-f003">Figure 3</xref>b portrays the effect of both temperature and extraction time on the yield of A. 
 <italic>malaccensis</italic> wood oil with 0.15 gr/mL of sample-to-solid ratio. The findings provide evidence that the rise in temperature brings about a higher yield of essential oil, while the extraction time has a somewhat minor effect on the yield, especially at temperatures above 200 °C. The results reveal that the parameter with the greatest impact on 
 <italic>A. malaccensis</italic> wood oil yield is temperature. At higher temperatures, the mass-transfer of the solvent and plant matrix tends to increase with the decrease in the density and viscosity of water [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-25-03872" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The highest yield was obtained when the temperature was around 200–260 °C, and the extraction time was equal to, or greater than 5 min.
