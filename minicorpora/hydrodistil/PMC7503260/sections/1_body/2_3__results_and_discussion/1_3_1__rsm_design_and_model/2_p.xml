<p>Furthermore, the high temperature-pressure associated with SCWE not only decreases the water polarity, but also increases the pressure within the plant cells. This increase in pressure effectively ruptures the cell walls, pores, and oil glands of the plant cells to enhance the essential oil recovery process [

 <xref rid="B27-molecules-25-03872" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, a prolonged extraction time under a high temperature leads to degradation, which reduces the oil yield [

 <xref rid="B29-molecules-25-03872" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Low yield at lowest and highest sample to water ratios may be explained by the extreme lack and excess of water, which can lead to charring and the hydrolytic effect, respectively. The high temperature and pressure associated with SCWE is significant as they (a) induce the effective rupturing of the cell wall, thus removing the main barrier to mass transfer, and (b) alter the properties of the water solvent to improve its solubility.
