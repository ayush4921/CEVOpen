<p>Equation (2) was used to plot 3D response surfaces for investigations on the interactive effect of variables (

 <italic>malaccensis</italic> wood oil, with the extraction time maintained at 17.5 min. Both the temperature (up to 250 °C) and sample-to-water ratio were positively associated to the yield of the essential oil. The results indicate that when the amount of sample and water is sufficient, and the temperature is raised to 250 °C, more essential oil is extracted from the wood. This is mainly due to the fact that this situation brings about a reduction in the polarity of the water. However, a further increase in temperature led to a decrease in essential oil yield, caused by adverse reactions such as hydrolysis, charring, and degradation [

 <xref rid="B29-molecules-25-03872" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The results also provided evidence that the sample-to-solvent ratio only has a minor effect on the yield of essential oil from wood. At ratios higher and lower than 0.12–0.2 gr/mL, the oil yield decreased due to charring or the hydrolytic effect, caused by the lack or excess of water, respectively. The optimum temperature-sample and solvent ratio was observed to be 190–250 °C and 0.13–0.2 gr/mL, respectively.
