<p>The lack-of-fit for the quadratic model (0.0778) (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-03872">Supplementary Materials Table S2</xref>) was not significant, as the probability value was higher than 0.05. Standard deviation, adjusted R
 <sup>2</sup>, predicted R
 <sup>2</sup>, and prediction error sum of squares (PRESS) obtained through the ANOVA (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-03872">Supplementary Materials Table S3</xref>) also supported the quadratic model. For yield of the essential oil, both the cubic and the quadratic models portrayed a low standard deviation, but the quadratic model has a lower PRESS value, as well as a high predicted, adjusted and normal R-squared. The predicted amount of 
 <italic>A. malaccensis</italic> wood oil under different extraction conditions is very close to the experiment results (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03872-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Additionally, all the points in the residual plot of experiment data (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-03872">Supplementary Materials Table S4</xref>) are close to the centre line, which is an indication of satisfactory residuals. Regression analysis for fitting the quadratic model to the data of the yield of the essential oil could explain 98.6% of the yield variation (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-03872-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The model’s 
 <italic>p</italic>-value is less than 0.05, while the F-value is higher than the model’s mean square. This is an indication of conformation to the quadratic model [

 <sup>2</sup> (0.979) and precision residual sum of square (PRESS &gt; 4) also confirmed the significance of the quadratic model.
