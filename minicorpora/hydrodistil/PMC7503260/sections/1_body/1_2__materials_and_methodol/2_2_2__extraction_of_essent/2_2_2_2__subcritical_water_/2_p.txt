0: A mixture of ground, dried raw-sample was loaded into a stainless-steel reactor (30 mL, 65 mm length, and 16 mm ID) (Swagelok, Solon, OH, USA), as shown in  Figure 1.
1: The steel reactor was then filled with water in accordance with the designated solvent-to-sample ratio.
2: Subsequently, the reactor was surged with argon gas to remove the presence of trapped air.
3: The cap was then secured to completely seal the reactor.
4: Prior to the extraction, the oil bath was preheated to the desired temperature (100271 C).
5: As soon as the heating bath (oil or salt bath) reached the set temperature, the reactor (filled with sample and water 0.080.22 gr/mL) was immersed in the bath.
6: The bath is equipped with an agitator, which serves to distribute the heat evenly during the extraction process ( Figure 1b).
7: On completion of the extraction process (within 134 min), the reactor was pulled out and immediately dipped into cool water.
8: Once the reactor was cooled down, the mixture, comprising sample and solvent, was transferred to a test tube for further purification and separation of essential oil, through the liquid-liquid extraction method, which is described in the following section.
