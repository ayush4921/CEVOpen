0: A Clevenger-type apparatus, described by European pharmacopeia, was used to extract essential oil from  A. malaccensis wood.
1: Prior to the extraction process, the wood was soaked in water for seven days, in order to speed up the release of essential oil.
2: Then, 100 g of air-dried and size-reduced wood of  A. Malaccensis, and an appropriate amount of distilled water, was placed in a bowl-shaped heating mantle, which was attached to the Clevenger.
3: The sample mixtures were boiled at 100 C and 1 atm to produce steam containing both water and essential oil.
4: This product was condensed and collected in a vessel of the Clevenger.
5: The extra condensed water was recycled to the flask during the extraction process.
6: The extraction process ends with the removal of water, followed by the collection of floating essential oil, both through the bottom.
7: The essential oil and wood sample, at optimized hydrodistillation conditions, were subsequently purified and analysed, for a later comparison with SCWE products.
