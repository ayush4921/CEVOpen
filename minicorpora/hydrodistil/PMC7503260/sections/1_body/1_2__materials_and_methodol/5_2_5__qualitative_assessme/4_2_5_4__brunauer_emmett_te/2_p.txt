0: Additionally, pore volume distribution was calculated based on the Barret, Joyner, and Halenda (BJH) method [ 18, 19].
1: As for the case of nitrogen, the cross-sectional area is taken as 16.2 A2/molecule.
2: BET experiments are typically conducted to a relative pressure, denoted as P/P 0, of approximately 0.3 at 77 K, where P 0 is the saturation pressure [ 20].
3: At relative pressures above the point at which a N 2 monolayer has formed on the solid, capillary condensation occurs within the pore structure of the material, such that the smaller pores are easily filled, and consecutively the larger pores are filled as the pressure is increased.
4: Upon reaching the saturation point, the P/P 0 is approximately 1.0, and the internal pore structure of the material contains condensed (liquid) nitrogen.
5: The total pore volume can be calculated by assuming that the density of liquid nitrogen (LIN) in the pores is similar to that of bulk LIN.
