0: Firstly, the chemical compounds were identified through their retention indices relative to n-alkanes indices on a HP-5 column.
1: The retention indices were determined using the retention times of n-alkanes (C 5-C 30), which were analysed using the same instrument and under the same chromatographic conditions.
2: NIST and WILEY libraries were used to identify the chemical compounds of the essential oils.
3: Relative amount of the individual component was based on percentage compositions of the essential oil, calculated by way of a computerized integrator, using the total ion chromatograms.
