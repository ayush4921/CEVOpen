0: Wood of  Aquilaria malaccensis was collected from the Forest Research Institute Malaysia (FRIM) garden.
1: The wood was air-dried in a dark room away from sunlight (to avoid the loss of volatiles due to light and temperature), and stored in a bag at a cool room temperature (4 C), for the experiments to follow.
2: All botanical materials require size-reduction before the extraction process, to improve sample distribution, heat transfer, and access to the cells content.
3: This will serve to quicken the release of essential oil.
4: A saw was used to cut the wood into smaller pieces.
5: Then, each piece of wood was shredded with a small knife.
6: The final step in the extraction preparation process involves the use of a grinder (Panasonic miller) to crush the shredded wood.
7: This is to prevent the loss of volatiles.
