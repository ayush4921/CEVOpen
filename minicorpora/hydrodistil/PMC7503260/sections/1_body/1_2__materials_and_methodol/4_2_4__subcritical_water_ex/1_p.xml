<p>Through screening experiments, the practical range of influential parameters (temperature, time, and solid to liquid ratio) was determined as follows: 100–271 °C for temperature, 0.08–0.2 gr/mL for sample-to-solvent ratio, and 1 to 30 min for extraction time. In this work, RSM incorporated with central composite design (CCD) at two levels was applied to ascertain the optimum value of the oil yield. Twenty-eight experiments (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-03872">Supplementary Materials Table S1</xref>) were performed and analysed using ANOVA. Linear, 2FI (two factorial), quadratic, and cubic models were fitted to the experimental data to acquire the regression equation. Then, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was employed to provide the statistical analysis details (lack of fits, PRESS, and others). This is to ensure the adequacy of each model [
