0: Through screening experiments, the practical range of influential parameters (temperature, time, and solid to liquid ratio) was determined as follows: 100271 C for temperature, 0.080.2 gr/mL for sample-to-solvent ratio, and 1 to 30 min for extraction time.
1: In this work, RSM incorporated with central composite design (CCD) at two levels was applied to ascertain the optimum value of the oil yield.
2: Twenty-eight experiments ( Supplementary Materials Table S1) were performed and analysed using ANOVA.
3: Linear, 2FI (two factorial), quadratic, and cubic models were fitted to the experimental data to acquire the regression equation.
4: Then, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was employed to provide the statistical analysis details (lack of fits, PRESS, and others).
5: This is to ensure the adequacy of each model [ 17].
6: In the next step, the effect of influential factors (temperature, sample-to-solvent ratio, and time) on the yield of essential oil was analysed.
7: The process concludes with the validation of the model.
