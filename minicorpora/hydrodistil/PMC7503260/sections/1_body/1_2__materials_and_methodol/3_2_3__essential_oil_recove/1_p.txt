0: The liquid part of the mixture, containing water and essential oil (aqueous mixture), was poured into a separation funnel, and the liquid-liquid extraction process proceeded with the addition of 5 mL of n-hexane, for the removal of essential oil from the mixture.
1: The liquid-liquid extraction process was replicated twice to ensure that no essential oil remained in the water.
2: The hexane was removed with the use of a rotary evaporator.
3: In the final step, sodium sulphate anhydrous was applied to the essential oil to remove any moisture or water.
4: The extracted essential oils were stored in a dark-sealed-vial at 4 C for further analysis.
5: The yield of each essential oil was calculated with the following equation: (1)y = V100W where y is the yield of essential oil (%  v/w), V is the volume of collected essential oil (mL), and W is the weight of the plant material (g) [ 5].
6: All experiments were carried out in triplicate, and the relative standard deviations, between replicate samples within the experimental range, were less than 5%.
