 <italic>malaccensis</italic>â€™ oil was extracted from its wood through SCWE. Temperature was identified as the most significant parameter as dramatic changes in oil yield was observed during variations in temperature. The interaction between temperature and reaction time greatly influences the essential oil yield through SCWE. Based on the GC/MS results, the 
 <italic>A. malaccensis</italic> wood oil extracted by way of SCWE is of significantly better quality than that extracted through hydrodistillation. Several value-added compounds with medicinal values (such as furfural and guaiacol) were observed to be present in essential oil extracted through SCWE. Further analysis through FTIR, SEM, and BET/BJH revealed that the severe damage to cell walls, cellulose, and hemicellulose of wood facilitates greater essential oil recovery during the extraction process. In short, not only is SCWE a superior method for extracting a higher yield and better quality of essential oil in a shorter time, but it also used a smaller sample volume, in comparison to conventional hydrodistillation.
