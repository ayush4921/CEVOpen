<p>In this investigation, the volatile constituents of 
 <italic>Haplophyllum canaliculatum</italic> were extracted by hydrodistillation (HD), solvent-free microwave extraction (SFME), and headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) methods. The essential oil obtained by the SFME method has higher percentage of oxygenated compounds, which are more odoriferous and valuable than the essential oil extracted by the HD process. SFME is a fast, eco-friendly, and low-cost method in comparison with the other extraction procedures. The usage of PDMS fiber as a nonpolar solid phase caused an increase in the extraction of nonpolar compounds compared with HD and SFME methods.
