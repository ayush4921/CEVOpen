<p>The volatile composition of

 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"> Figure 6</xref> shows the resultant gas chromatograms by these methods. As shown in 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, twenty-five compounds represent 99.88% of the total compounds in the oil that are obtained by the HD method, with 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene (18.90%), 1,8-cineole (13.94%), piperitone (12.22%), 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene (8.95%), and limonene (8.40%) characterized as dominate compounds. Piperitone (34.50%), caryophyllene oxide (9.94%), 
 <italic>α</italic>-eudesmol (7.94%), elemol (6.32%), and 1,8-cineole (5.56%) were the main compounds among twenty-one identified constituents, which represent 99.89% of the total composition in essential oil extracted by the SFME producer. Thirteen compounds, representing 99.95% of the total constituents, were characterized in a volatile fraction extracted by the HS-SPME method, with 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene (21.13%), 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene (13.07%), limonene (11.65%), and 
 <italic>δ</italic>-2-carene (10.23%) as major constituents.
