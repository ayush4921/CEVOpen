<p>The optimization for exposure time was carried out for 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes. It has been specified that 10 minutes was the optimum exposure time as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. After 10 minutes of exposure time, the extraction of the main volatiles increased, and then, by increasing the exposure time, isolation of these components decreased. Desorption of volatiles from the fiber by increasing the contact time resulted in this reduction.
