<p>It has been specified that as the temperature of the extraction increased, the rate of extraction changed as well. However, the distribution decreased constantly. Therefore, to obtain desirable sensitivity and extraction rate, an adequate temperature is needed. The amount of the volatile fractions was at its highest at the temperature of 70°C and after 10 minutes of exposure time (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). It seems that at this time, the HS-SPME process reaches equilibrium, and SPME has a maximum sensitivity at this point. Increasing the sample weights caused an increase in the concentrations of the volatile fractions in the headspace. Samples of 1, 2, and 5 g were placed in the SPME vial, and the HS-SPME process was carried out for 10 minutes at 70°C. The peak areas of the extracted main components were plotted for different weights of samples (
