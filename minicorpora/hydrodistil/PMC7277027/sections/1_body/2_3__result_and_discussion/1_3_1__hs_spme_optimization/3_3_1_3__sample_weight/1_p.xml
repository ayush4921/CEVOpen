<p>HS-SPME was carried out with samples of 1, 2, and 5 g, which were placed in the SPME. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the optimum weight of leaves of 
 <italic>Haplophyllum canaliculatum</italic> was 2 g. The differences between 2 and 5 g samples were negligible; therefore, 2 g samples were used in HS-SPME experiments.
