<p>As HS-SPME efficiency is affected by temperature, the effect of temperature on isolation of main components, obtained by this method, was investigated. At less than 50째C, the adsorption of volatiles was not considerable, and also, on the other hand, at temperatures above 90째C, desorption of the compounds from fiber was significant. Then, the temperature range was selected as 50 to 90째C. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the optimum temperature for leaves of 
 <italic>Haplophyllum canaliculatum</italic> was 70째C.
