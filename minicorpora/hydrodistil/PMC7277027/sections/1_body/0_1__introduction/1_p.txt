0: The genus  Haplophyllum belongs to the Rutaceae family, and its eighteen species are present in Iran.
1: These species are scattered in different regions of Iran (deserts and mountain ranges) .
2: H. canaliculatum,  H. tuberculatum,  H. perforatum, and  H. robustum are endemic species of Iran.
3: Some species of  Haplophyllum are grown in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Middle Asia, North Africa, Arabic countries, Anatolia, Iraq, and Palestine [ 1].
4: Literature survey revealed that the chemical composition of some species of  Haplophyllum was studied previously.
5: -ocimene (12.3%) and  -caryophyllene (11.6%) were the main constituents in the essential oil of  H. tuberculatum from Oman [ 2].
6: The volatile fraction of  H. tuberculatum from the United Arab Emirate was dominated by linalool (15.0%) and linalyl acetate (10.6%) as main compounds [ 3].
7: The major constituents in the essential oil of  H. linifolium from Spain which was characterized were  -caryophyllene (20.64%), bicyclogermacrene (14.73%), and  d-cadinene (13.40%) [ 4].
8: Palmito- -lactone (45.8%) and octadecatrienoic acid (10.7%) were the main compounds in the essential oil of  H. megalanthum reported from Turkey [ 5].
9: GC-MS analysis of  H. canaliculatum collected from Shiraz, Fars, Iran, showed that shoot cultures mainly contained piperitone (10.92%) and  -caryophyllene (12.67%) [ 6].
10: The essential oil of  Haplophyllum buhsei Boiss.
11: from Iran was analyzed for the first time using gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GC-MS).
12: The major compounds were  -caryophyllene (12.9%), limonene (9.7%),  -pinene (7.9%), linalool (7.4%),  -pinene (6.4%), and 1,8-cineole (5.5%) [ 7].
13: H. robustum Bge.
14: was isolated by hydrodistillation and was analyzed by GC-MS. Twenty-three compounds representing 86.1% of the total components were detected.
15: The oil consisted mainly of monoterpene hydrocarbons and a small percentage of sesquiterpenes.
16: The major compounds were sabinene (30.5%), -pinene (18.2%), and limonene (12.1%) [ 8].
