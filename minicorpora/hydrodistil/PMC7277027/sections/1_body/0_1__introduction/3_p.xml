<p>Pawliszyn and his coworkers have introduced solid-phase microextraction (SPME), which was developed for the analysis of volatiles in plant tissues [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Some advantages of the SPME method for the analysis of volatile components are that it is time saving, solvent-free, and cost-effective and requires a small amount of samples [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>–
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].
