<p>The genus 
 <italic>Haplophyllum</italic> belongs to the Rutaceae family, and its eighteen species are present in Iran. These species are scattered in different regions of Iran (deserts and mountain ranges)
 <italic>. H. canaliculatum</italic>, 
 <italic>H. tuberculatum</italic>, 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic>, and 
 <italic>H. robustum</italic> are endemic species of Iran. Some species of 
 <italic>Haplophyllum</italic> are grown in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Middle Asia, North Africa, Arabic countries, Anatolia, Iraq, and Palestine [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Literature survey revealed that the chemical composition of some species of 
 <italic>Haplophyllum</italic> was studied previously. 
 <italic>β</italic>-ocimene (12.3%) and 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene (11.6%) were the main constituents in the essential oil of 
 <italic>H. tuberculatum</italic> from Oman [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The volatile fraction of 
 <italic>H. tuberculatum</italic> from the United Arab Emirate was dominated by linalool (15.0%) and linalyl acetate (10.6%) as main compounds [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The major constituents in the essential oil of 
 <italic>H. linifolium</italic> from Spain which was characterized were 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene (20.64%), bicyclogermacrene (14.73%), and 
 <italic>d</italic>-cadinene (13.40%) [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Palmito-
 <italic>γ</italic>-lactone (45.8%) and octadecatrienoic acid (10.7%) were the main compounds in the essential oil of 
 <italic>H. megalanthum</italic> reported from Turkey [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. GC-MS analysis of 
 <italic>H. canaliculatum</italic> collected from Shiraz, Fars, Iran, showed that shoot cultures mainly contained piperitone (10.92%) and 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene (12.67%) [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The essential oil of 
 <italic>Haplophyllum buhsei</italic> Boiss. from Iran was analyzed for the first time using gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The major compounds were 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene (12.9%), limonene (9.7%), 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene (7.9%), linalool (7.4%), 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene (6.4%), and 1,8-cineole (5.5%) [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. 
 <italic>H. robustum</italic> Bge. was isolated by hydrodistillation and was analyzed by GC-MS. Twenty-three compounds representing 86.1% of the total components were detected. The oil consisted mainly of monoterpene hydrocarbons and a small percentage of sesquiterpenes. The major compounds were sabinene (30.5%), β-pinene (18.2%), and limonene (12.1%) [
