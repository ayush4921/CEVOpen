<p>GC-MS analysis was performed on a Hewlett-Packard 6890 gas chromatograph coupled with a 5973 mass selective detector, which was equipped with a HP-5MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm, film thickness 0.32 
 <italic>μ</italic>m). The program temperature was similar to the GC condition. Helium (99.999% purity) was used as a carrier gas with 1 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup> flow rate. Mass spectra were achieved at 70 eV as ionization energy in the electron impact mode.
