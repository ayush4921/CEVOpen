<p>The chemical composition of samples was analyzed by GC and GC-MS. The GC analysis was performed using Shimadzu GC-15A with a 30 m × 0.25 mm, film thickness 0.32 
 <italic>μ</italic>m DB-5 column. The initial temperature was 60°C (3 minutes hold time), then heated to 230°C as the final temperature with 5°C min
 <sup>−1</sup> heat gradient, and kept 10 minutes in 230°C. Injector and FID detector temperatures were set at 250°C. N
 <sub>2</sub> was used as a carrier gas (1 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup>). Quantitative data were acquired from the area percentage of each GC peak without the use of correction parameters.
