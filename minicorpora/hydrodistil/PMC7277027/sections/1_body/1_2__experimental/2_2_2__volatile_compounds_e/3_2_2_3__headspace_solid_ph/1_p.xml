<p>HS-SPME is an efficient method to isolate volatile organic compounds (VOCs). 2 g of powdered dried leaves of 
 <italic>H. canaliculatum</italic> were placed in a 20 mL vial that was capped with the PTFE septum and placed in room temperature for 24 h (equilibrium time). A manual SPME holder with a 65 
 <italic>μ</italic>m polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) (Supelco, USA, 2011) fiber was used for adsorbing the VOCs of 
 <italic>H. canaliculatum</italic>, which conditioned in the GC injector at 250°C for 5 h. The fiber was placed in headspace of the vial for 10 minutes (extraction time). Desorption of VOCs was performed at 250°C for 2 minutes in splitless GC and GC-MS injectors. The adsorbed analytes were desorbed at 250°C for 4 minutes in splitless GC and GC-MS injectors.
