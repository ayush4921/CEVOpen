0: Toxicity tests were performed in 15 mL plastic Falcon tubes containing 8 g of treated wheat.
1: One mL of essential oil diluted in acetone at concentrations of respectively 1; 2; 3; 4 and 5% ( v/v) were applied on the wheat except for  Gaultheria procumbens for which concentrations of 5; 3; 2; 1 and 0.75% were used.
2: Moreover, because of its efficiency, the same tests of mortality have been realized for  Allium sativum at lower concentrations of 0.75%; 0.5%, 0.25% and 0.125%.
