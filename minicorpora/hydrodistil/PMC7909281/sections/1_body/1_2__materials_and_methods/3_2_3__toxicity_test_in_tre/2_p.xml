<p>Toxicity tests were performed in 15 mL plastic Falcon tubes containing 8 g of treated wheat. One mL of essential oil diluted in acetone at concentrations of respectively 1; 2; 3; 4 and 5% (
 <italic>v/v</italic>) were applied on the wheat except for 
 <italic>Gaultheria procumbens</italic> for which concentrations of 5; 3; 2; 1 and 0.75% were used. Moreover, because of its efficiency, the same tests of mortality have been realized for 
 <italic>Allium sativum</italic> at lower concentrations of 0.75%; 0.5%, 0.25% and 0.125%.
