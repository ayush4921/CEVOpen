<p>After EO application, samples were mixed by a vortex for 1 min to homogenize the treatment. The control treatment consisted of five Falcons with 8 g of wheat treated with 1 mL of acetone only. Treated wheat dried for 15 min under hood to eliminate the acetone. Then, twenty insects per falcon were added to the wheat and Falcon were closed by a tulle to allow air circulation. Tubes were placed under controlled condition (28 °C ± 1 °C; 75 ± 5% RH). Temperature and humidity were chosen as the optimum for
