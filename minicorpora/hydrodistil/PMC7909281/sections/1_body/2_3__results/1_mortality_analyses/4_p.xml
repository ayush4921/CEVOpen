<p>For most of EOs tested, time of exposure did not have a significant effect on percentage of mortality, indicating that a knock down effect is rapidly observed (
 <xref rid="foods-10-00200-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). However, this observation does not hold for three EOs after 24 h and 7 days,
