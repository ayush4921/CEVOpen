<p>Toxicity on the target pests is a first step for any kind of new pesticide elaboration. However, in the perspective of a potential utilization of essential oils in an industrial context, it is also essential to focus on some other aspects, such as the price, the wheat deterioration or the mammal toxicity to determine their actual industrial potential. Concerning mammal toxicity, the WHO classification ranked compounds from “extremely hazardous” to “unlikely to present acute hazard” based on the concentration in mg/kg that provoke 50% of mortality in rat (WHO, 2009). Concerning 
 <italic>A. sativum,</italic> diallyl trisulfide is ranked as “unlikely to present acute hazard” while diallyl disulfide is considered as moderately hazardous with an oral LD50 (rat) of 260 mg/kg. Even if this toxicity is two to four times lower than deltamethrin currently used in granaries, it remains to be carefully considered in the case of a conception of healthy and ecofriendly alternatives to insecticide.
