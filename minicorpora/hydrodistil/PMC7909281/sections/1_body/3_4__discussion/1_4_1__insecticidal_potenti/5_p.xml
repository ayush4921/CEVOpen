<p>Despite numerous studies on the toxicity of essential oil on stored product pests, little data is available on the mechanism of action of the insecticidal effect of these essential oils as a mixture of molecules. However, some studies highlight some mechanisms. For instance, Jankowska et al. [
 <xref rid="B51-foods-10-00200" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] showed that menthol acts on octopamine receptors and trigger protein kinase A phosphorylation pathway on cockroach DUM neurons. Hong et al. [
 <xref rid="B52-foods-10-00200" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] indicate a potential interference of methyl salicylate and eugenol with octopamynergic system as well. Action on octopamine receptors is an advantage in the elaboration of an insecticide due to absence of key role in vertebrates involving a relative security for human health. However, methyl salicylate is known to have a LD50 oral (rat) of 887 mg/kg indicating that it should have another mechanism of action on mammals. Therefore, the mere fact that octopamynergic system is targeted by an essential oil cannot guarantee safety for human health. β-caryophyllene was identified as an inhibitor of the activities of acetylcholine esterase, polyphenol oxidase and carboxylesterase on

 <italic>Ephestia kuehniella</italic> by decreasing activity of digestive enzymes [
 <xref rid="B55-foods-10-00200" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Diallyl trisulfide, another major compound of garlic EO, has been recently described as a regulator of the expression of the chitin synthase A gene which generates alteration of the morphology and inhibition of the oviposition of 
 <italic>Sitotroga cerealella</italic> [

Therefore, it is important to analyse their impact on insect as a whole. For example, a recent study shows that 
 <italic>M. arvensis</italic> EO is associated with a systemic mode of action on 
 <italic>S. granarius</italic> since it is capable of altering the nervous and muscular systems, cellular respiration processes and the cuticle, the first protective barrier of insects [
