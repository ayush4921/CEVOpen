<p>Garlic essential oil has been identified as the most toxic oil with a LC90 two to four times lower than other EOs, probably because of its content in sulfur compounds. Its toxicity on other insect pests of stored products like

 <xref rid="B42-foods-10-00200" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] calculated a KD50 (knock down) of 1.32 mg/cm
 <sup>2</sup> and 7.65 mg/cm
 <sup>2</sup> of garlic essential oil against 
 <italic>T. castaneum</italic> and 
 <italic>S. zeamais</italic> respectively. In addition, Plata-Rueda et al. [
 <xref rid="B40-foods-10-00200" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] have identified diallyl disulfide as the most toxic compounds present in the garlic essential oil explaining its efficiency on 
 <italic>Tenebrio molitor.</italic> Contact and fumigation toxicities of diallyl trisulfide has been highlighted by Huang et al. [
 <xref rid="B43-foods-10-00200" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] on 
 <italic>T. castaneum</italic> and 
 <italic>S. zeamais</italic>. Contrary to most other essential oils, these molecules are not present in the garlic clove itself, but arise from the conversion of thiosulfinates (water-soluble) to sulfides (oil-soluble) during the hydrodistillation process [
 <xref rid="B44-foods-10-00200" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In short, the main sulfur compounds in the whole garlic clove are cysteine sulfoxides like allylcysteine sulfoxide (alliine) and methylcysteine sulfoxide (methiine) which are located in the clove mesophyll storage cells. After crushing the clove, those compounds come in contact with the enzyme 
 <italic>alliinase</italic> that is normally localized in the vascular bundle sheath cells. The vast majority of cysteine sulfoxides are then converted in sulfenic acids which self-condense to thiosulfinates like allicin which is the most abundant compound (60â€“90% of total thiosulfinate). Allicin is quite unstable depending on the medium and temperature. Upon hydrodistillation, thiosulfinates are transformed into diallyl trisulfide, diallyl disulfide and allyl methyl trisulfide as major products [
