<p>At the opposite, Zohry et al. [
 <xref rid="B50-foods-10-00200" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] tested toxicity of 10 essential oils on 
 <italic>S. granarius</italic> by exposure to treated wheat in a protocol close to that of this study. Garlic oil was identified as the most toxic one with a concentration of oil per grams of grain similar to ours. However, no precision on composition of EOs are available in their publication, which do not allow a deeper comparison. Further studies on the evaluation of the industrial potential of essential oils need to be based on a common protocol taking into account the influence of the media [
