 <italic>Gaultheria procumbens, M. arvensis</italic> and 
 <italic>E. dives</italic> are among the less costly essential oils on the market. Moreover, these three oils are easily available on the market. Based on our results, their toxicity and their price, these three essential oils could represent good opportunity to develop a botanical insecticide to control insect pest in stored product. We did not obtain a commercial price for
