<p>Thirdly, our experiment has been conducted at 28 Â°C. The evaporation rate of essential oils is rapid at this temperature and a substantial part of the essential oil may have vanished after 24 h. Heydarzade et al. [

 <italic>Foeniculum vulgare.</italic> Treated filter paper induced a 99% mortality at time zero and 0% 30 h after application on
