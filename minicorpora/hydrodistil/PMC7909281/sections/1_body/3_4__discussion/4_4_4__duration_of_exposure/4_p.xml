<p>Studies must be carried out on the combined influence of evaporation and absorption by grains of essential oils in order to demonstrate their toxicity persistence over time. In further studies, it is a priority to include GC-MS analyses of treated wheat that allowed scientists to determine the behavior of essential oils and its remanence at the surface and inside the treated wheat until the end of experiment. This factor is essential to control insect pests that lay eggs into the grain, which causes a delay between treatment and the potential contact with the insecticide product by emerging individuals.</p>
