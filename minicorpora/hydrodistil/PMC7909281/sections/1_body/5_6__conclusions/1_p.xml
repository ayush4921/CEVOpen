<p>Considering insecticidal effects, prices, availability and mammal toxicity of essential oils tested, 
 <italic>M. arvensis, E. dives</italic> and 
 <italic>G. procumbens</italic> can be considered as good potential alternatives to the synthetic pesticides presently used to control grain weevils. As essential oils are products of very variable composition, studies must be performed to clearly identify the compound(s) responsible of the insecticidal toxicity of these three essential oils to avoid variable responses to future treatments. More investigations need to be done on the mechanism of action of these oils, including the role of minor components, both on insects and mammals, to secure their industrial use.
