<p>Nevertheless, few actual applications have emerged for the protection of stored foodstuffs and we still lack a systematic screening of potently active oils under conditions mimicking storage reality and with a standardized strain of insects. The aim of our study was precisely to test and rank 25 essential oils commonly used and available on the market against 
 <italic>S. granarius.</italic> Special care has been taken for the selection of essential oil based on a large array of chemical composition (different major compounds or groups of major compounds,

In order to remain under realistic conditions for industrial large-scale application, data as price, availability on the market or health implications has been taken into account in our discussion. To allow comparison, a standardized strain of 
 <italic>S. granarius</italic> was used for all the test performed under the same experimental conditions. Determination of essential oils toxicity has been done by treating the wheat grains directly, considering that the presence of wheat may influence results [
