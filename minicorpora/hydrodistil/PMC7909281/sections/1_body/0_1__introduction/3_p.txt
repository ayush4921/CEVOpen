1: Many authors [ 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29] have investigated the use of essential oils as alternative insecticides against  S. granarius.
2: Yildirim et al.
3: [ 30] demonstrated the high fumigation toxicity of  Satureja hortensis among eleven essential oils from Lamiaceae family on  S. granarius.
4: Others have highlighted the contact toxicity by topical application of essential oils, such as Conti et al.
5: [ 28] with  Hyptis genera plants.
6: A few less have worked on treated grains taking into account contact, fumigation and ingestion intoxication paths together [ 31].
7: The repellency potential of essential oils was also analysed [ 32, 33] for  S. granarius.
8: In addition, essential oils were reported as a good food deterrent, as in the case of  H. spicigera essential oils against  Sitophilus zeamais, preventing grain degradation [ 34].
