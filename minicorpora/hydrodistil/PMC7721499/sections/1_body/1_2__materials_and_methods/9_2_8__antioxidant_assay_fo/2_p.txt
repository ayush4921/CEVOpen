0: HepG2 cells (6  10 4 cells/well) were incubated for 24 h. Then, the medium was removed, and cells were washed with phosphate buffer 3 times.
1: The wells were treated with 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) (Sigma-Aldrich, Co LLC, USA) and with either quercetin standards or (0.42  g/ml) samples (503200  g/ml).
2: The microplate was incubated (60 min at 37C).
3: Then, the liquid was removed, and cells were washed by PBS.
4: Finally, free radical initiator solution (AAPH) was added to the wells, and the plate was read on the Polar star omega device [ 9].
