0: In brief, DPPH solution was mixed with of sample solutions (12.53200  g/ml) in the 96-well microplate; after incubation (30 min, 25C), the absorbance was measured at 492 nm [ 11].
1: The result was used to determine the concentration of the extracts required to scavenge 50% of the DPPH free radicals (IC 50), and quercetin (3.121600  g/ml) was used as a standard.
