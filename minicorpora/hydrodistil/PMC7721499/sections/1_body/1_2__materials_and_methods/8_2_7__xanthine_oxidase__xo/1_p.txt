0: The inhibition effects of the sample on XO activity were done according to the kit protocol.
1: (Xanthine oxidase activity kit, Sigma-Aldrich).
2: The xanthine oxidase activity of the sample and vitamin C at 100  g/ml concentration were measured.
3: XO inhibitory activity was evaluated by the following formula: (2)% enzyme inhibition=1ba100,where  a is the activity of the enzyme without sample and  b is the activity of XO with sample [ 9].
