<p>The procedure was performed by the Polar star omega device (BMG LABTECH GmbH, Germany). The final assay mixture contained fluorescein (Sigma-Aldrich, Co. LLC, USA) (10 nm), AAPH (Sigma-Aldrich, Co. LLC, USA) (240 mM), and sample (25–400 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) or phosphate buffer as the blank. The decline of mixture fluorescence intensity was recorded every 90 s per cycle. Different concentrations of Trolox (Sigma-Aldrich, Co. LLC, USA) (3–50 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) were used to give a standard curve to compare the ORAC values of samples. The data were analyzed by data analysis software (MARS). The difference between the “area under the fluorescence decay curve” (AUC) of blank and each sample was expressed as Trolox equivalents (TE) [
