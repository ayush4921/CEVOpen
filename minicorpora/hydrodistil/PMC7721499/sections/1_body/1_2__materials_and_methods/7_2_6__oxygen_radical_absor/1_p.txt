0: The procedure was performed by the Polar star omega device (BMG LABTECH GmbH, Germany).
1: The final assay mixture contained fluorescein (Sigma-Aldrich, Co. LLC, USA) (10 nm), AAPH (Sigma-Aldrich, Co. LLC, USA) (240 mM), and sample (25400  g/ml) or phosphate buffer as the blank.
2: The decline of mixture fluorescence intensity was recorded every 90 s per cycle.
3: Different concentrations of Trolox (Sigma-Aldrich, Co. LLC, USA) (350  g/ml) were used to give a standard curve to compare the ORAC values of samples.
4: The data were analyzed by data analysis software (MARS).
5: The difference between the area under the fluorescence decay curve (AUC) of blank and each sample was expressed as Trolox equivalents (TE) [ 9].
