0: In this assay, the mixture of sodium nitroprusside (Sigma-Aldrich, Co. LLC, USA) and a sample was incubated at 27C for 150 min.
1: Then, Griess reagent was added to the mixture and then incubated at room temperature for 5 min.
2: As a final point, absorbance was measured at 542 nm [ 11].
3: Nitric oxide radical scavenging was determined as follows: (1)A1AA1100,where  A1 denotes control absorbance and  A denotes test absorbance.
