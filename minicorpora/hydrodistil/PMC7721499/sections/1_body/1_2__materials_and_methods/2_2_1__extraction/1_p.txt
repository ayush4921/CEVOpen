0: Liquid byproduct was filtered, freeze-dried by freeze dryer (Zirbus, Germany), and ground into powder.
1: The powder was suspended in water containing trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) (Samchun, Korea) (0.3%) and poured into the decanter, where it was shaken adequately with ethyl acetate (Samchun, Korea).
2: This extraction procedure was repeated three times, and the aqueous phase was collected in each repeat.
3: The aqueous phase was loaded on Amberlite XAD-7 (2.5  45 cm) (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA), and the stationary phase was rinsed with water containing TFA.
4: Then, for the last time, the stationary phase was rinsed with methanol containing TFA, and then the extract was collected and concentrated using a rotary evaporator.
