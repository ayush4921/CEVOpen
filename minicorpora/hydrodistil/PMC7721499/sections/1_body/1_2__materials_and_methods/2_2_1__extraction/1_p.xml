<p>Liquid byproduct was filtered, freeze-dried by freeze dryer (Zirbus, Germany), and ground into powder. The powder was suspended in water containing trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) (Samchun, Korea) (0.3%) and poured into the decanter, where it was shaken adequately with ethyl acetate (Samchun, Korea). This extraction procedure was repeated three times, and the aqueous phase was collected in each repeat. The aqueous phase was loaded on Amberlite XAD-7 (2.5 × 45 cm) (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA), and the stationary phase was rinsed with water containing TFA. Then, for the last time, the stationary phase was rinsed with methanol containing TFA, and then the extract was collected and concentrated using a rotary evaporator.</p>
