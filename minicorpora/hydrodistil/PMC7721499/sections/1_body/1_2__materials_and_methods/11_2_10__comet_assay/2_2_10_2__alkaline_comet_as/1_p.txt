0: The alkaline comet assay was performed according to the guidelines of Singh et al.
1: with some modifications [ 13].
2: The cells were treated with different concentrations of sample and H 2O 2 (100  M) simultaneously (20 min in the dark at 4C) to inhibit DNA repair followed by the induced oxidative DNA damage.
3: H 2O 2 solution in PBS was used as a positive control.
4: The cells were harvested and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min and then washed with PBS.
5: The cell pellets were mixed with 100  l of low melting point agarose (0.75% w/v), then spread on a microscopic slide precoated with normal melting agarose (1%), covered with a coverslip, and kept for 10 min at 4C.
6: After removing the coverslips, the slides were immersed in freshly prepared cold lysing solution (2.5 M NaCl, 100 mM Na 2EDTA, 10 mM tris, 1% (v/v) triton X-100, 10% DMSO, pH 10.0) at 4C for at least 2 h. The slides were presoaked in freshly prepared alkaline electrophoresis buffer for 30 min.
7: Electrophoresis was carried out (45 min at 4C).
8: All procedural steps were performed under yellow light conditions to minimize additional DNA damage.
9: Then, slides were placed vertically in a neutralizing tank and washed with a neutralizing solution (0.4 m tris HCl buffer, pH 7.5).
10: Lastly, the slides were stained with propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) (20  g/ml) dispensed directly onto the slides and covered with a coverslip.
11: The slides were studied by a fluorescent microscope (Olympus-BX61).
12: All experiments were performed at least three times.
13: For each slide, 50 selected cells were analyzed with CometScore software.
