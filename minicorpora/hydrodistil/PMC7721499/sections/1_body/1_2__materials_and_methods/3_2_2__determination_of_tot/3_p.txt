0: Flavonoid content was determined by the colorimetric method.
1: Quercetin (Sigma-Aldrich, Co. LLC, USA) was used as the standard for total flavonoid content measurement.
2: This content was calculated from a calibration curve, and the result was expressed as mg quercetin equivalent per g dry weight of the sample.
3: Data were recorded as mean  standard deviation (SD) for three replicates [ 9].
4: Total anthocyanin was measured according to the pH differential spectroscopic method [ 10].
