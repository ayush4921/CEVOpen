<p>Flavonoid content was determined by the colorimetric method. Quercetin (Sigma-Aldrich, Co. LLC, USA) was used as the standard for total flavonoid content measurement. This content was calculated from a calibration curve, and the result was expressed as mg quercetin equivalent per g dry weight of the sample. Data were recorded as mean ± standard deviation (SD) for three replicates [
