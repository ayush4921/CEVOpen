0: The cell viability assay was determined by a modified 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay.
1: In brief, 10 4/well HepG2 cells were seeded in 96-well culture plates and allowed to grow 24 h followed by treatment with samples (50800  g/ml) for 24 and 48 h. The medium was removed, MTT solution was added, and incubated at 37C for 4 h. The generated formazan was solubilized with DMSO.
2: The absorption was measured at 570 nm [ 12].
