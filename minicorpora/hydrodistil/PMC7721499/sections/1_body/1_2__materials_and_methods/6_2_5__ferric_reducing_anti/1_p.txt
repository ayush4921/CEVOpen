0: The FRAP reagent contains TPTZ solution (2,4,6-tripyridyl-s-triazine) (10 mM in HCl), FeCl 3 (20 mM in H 2O), and acetate buffer (300 mM, pH = 3.6).
1: The fresh mixture was prepared and incubated at 37C (10 min).
2: Subsequently, 180  L of FRAP reagent and 20  L of each sample were mixed.
3: Finally, the absorbance of the reaction mixture was measured at 593 nm after incubation at 37C for 10 min.
4: The concentration ranges of samples and standard were 12.53200  g/ml.
5: Results were reported as IC 50 [ 10].
