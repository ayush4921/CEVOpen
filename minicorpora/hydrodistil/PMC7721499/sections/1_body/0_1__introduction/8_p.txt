0: In this study, the polyphenol-rich fraction was isolated from  R. damascena waste waters by Amberlite column as the stationary phase.
1: The phenolic compound content and antioxidant activity of byproduct is compared before and after using the column to realize the efficacy of these types of column to concentrate active compounds.
2: Furthermore, XO inhibition and protective effects against DNA damage induced by H 2O 2 on isolated human lymphocytes of the fraction were measured to determine the biological activity of separated fraction.
