0: Initial tests were conducted to assist in selecting the appropriate range of concentrations.
1: Bioassays were carried out on 4 th instar larvae, which were deprived of nutrition for 4 h before the onset of experiments.
2: The essential oil concentrations of 0.5, 0.7, 1, 1.4 and 2% ( W/ V) in acetone as solvent (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) were selected.
3: For bioassays, mulberry leaf disks (8 cm in diameter) were immersed in desired concentrations for 10 s and then air-dried at room temperature for 30 min.
4: Ten 4th instar  G. pyloalis were placed on each disk.
5: The mortality was documented after 24 h. Control groups were placed on disks treated with acetone.
6: The control and treated groups were replicated four times.
