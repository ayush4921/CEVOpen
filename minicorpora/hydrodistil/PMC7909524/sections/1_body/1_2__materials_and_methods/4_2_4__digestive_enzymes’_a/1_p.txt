0: In order to evaluate digestive enzymes activity, the larvae that were treated with LC 50, LC 30, and LC 10 (Lethal Concentration to kill 50, 30, and 10% of insects, respectively) dosages of essential oil obtained from oral and fumigant bioassays and the controls were dissected in ringers solution (9%  v/ v NaCl and isotonic) 24 h after treatment and their digestive systems (only midguts) were dissected out.
1: Five midguts for each treatment and control were first homogenized in 500 L of universal buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate-borate at pH 7.1) in a tissue homogenizer (DWK885300-0001-1EA, Merk, Darmstadt, Germany).
2: The supernatant was then kept at 20 C until analyzed.
