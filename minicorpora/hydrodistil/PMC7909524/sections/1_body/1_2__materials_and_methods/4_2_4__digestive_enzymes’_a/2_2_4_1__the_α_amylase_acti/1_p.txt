0: The reagent dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS, Sigma, St. Louis, MI, USA) in 1% soluble starch was used to estimate -amylase activity according to the method of Bernfeld (1955) [ 21].
1: Briefly, 20 L of the enzyme was poured into 40 L of soluble starch and 100 L of universal buffer (pH 7).
2: The mixture was incubated for 30 min at 35 C, and DNS (100 L) was then added to stop the reaction.
3: The absorbance was read at 540 nm in an ELISA reader (Awareness, Temecula, CA, USA).
