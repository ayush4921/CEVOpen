0: Here, we used Triton X-100 in order to hydrolyze glucosidases (- and -) for 20 h at 40 C in a ratio of 10 mg of Triton X-100/mg protein.
1: Then, we incubated 75 mL p-nitrophenyl-- d-glucopyranoside (pNaG, 5 mM), p-nitrophenyl-- d-glucopyranoside (pNbG, 5 mM), 125 mL universal buffer (made of 2%Mol MES (2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid), glycine, and succinate, 100 mM, pH 5.0), and 50 mL enzyme solution.
2: In order to stop the reaction, 2 mL of sodium carbonate (1 M) was used and the absorbance was read at 450 nm [ 24].
