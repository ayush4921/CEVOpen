1: To quantify the whole body protein, the method of Bradford (1976) [ 25], using the kit (GDA01A, Biochem Co., Tehran, Iran), was incorporated, while glucose and triglyceride were measured by Siegert (1987) [ 26] method and the triglyceride diagnostic kit, respectively (Pars Azmoon Co., Tehran, Iran).
2: Key enzymes including esterase (general esterases with - and -naphthyl acetate substrates), glutathione S-transferase (GST), and phenol oxidase (PO) were assessed by the method described by van Asperen (1962) [ 27], Habing et al.
