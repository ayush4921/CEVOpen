0: The essential oil was analyzed through gas chromatography (Agilent Technologies 7890B) coupled with a mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies 5977A), which was armed with an HP-5MS ((5%-phenyl)-methylpolysiloxane) capillary column with a 30-m length, 0.25-mm width, and an internal thickness of 0.25 m. Helium gas at a 1 mL/min flow rate was used, while the column temperature started from 50 and reached to 280 C at a rate of 5 C/min.
1: A 10%  A. annua essential oil solution in methanol ( v/ v) was prepared, and 1 L of solution was injected.
2: Spectra were obtained in the electron impact mode with 70 eV of ionization energy.
3: The scan range was between 30600  m/ z.
4: The identification of components was performed by comparing mass spectral fragmentation patterns and retention indices with those described in the databases [ 19, 20].
