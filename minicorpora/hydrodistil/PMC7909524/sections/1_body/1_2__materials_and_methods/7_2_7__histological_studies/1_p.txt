0: The larvae midguts were separated from the whole dissected gut in insect ringer and were immediately fixed in aqueous Buine solution for 24 h [ 10].
1: Also, the ovary of adults (2 days old), emerging from either treated or control larvae, were separated and fixed.
2: The tissues were processed for embedding in paraffin after being dehydrated in grades of ethanol alcohol and also cleaned by xylene.
3: The fixed tissues were then cut by 5-M thickness through a rotary microtome (Model 2030; Leica, Wetzlar, Germany).
4: The hematoxylin and eosin were used for staining and then permanent slides were thus prepared, observed, and photographed under a light microscope (M1000 light microscope; Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) armed with an EOS 600D digital camera (Canon, Tokyo, Japan).
