0: The amount of various circulating blood cells in mm 3 of larval lesser mulberry pyralid treated with sublethal doses of  A. annua oil and in controls were assessed.
1: The hemolymph was drawn from one of the larval prolegs, cutting by a fine scissor, using a capillary glass tube (10 L for each treatment).
2: Then, the blood was diluted five times with a solution of anticoagulant (0.017 M EDTA, 0.186 M NaCl, 0.098 M NaOH, and 0.041 M citric acid at pH 4.5).
3: An improved Neubauer hemocytometer (mlabs, HBG, Giessen, Germany) [ 30] was used to assess the total cells using the formula of Jones (1962) [ 31].
4: A drop of hemolymph was collected from cut proleg of treated and control larvae.
5: A smear was formed and stained with diluted Giemsa (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) in distilled water (1:9) for 25 min, then just dipped in a saturated solution of lithium carbonate, and, finally, washed with distilled water.
6: Permanent slides were prepared in Canada balsam (Merck Darmstadt, Germany).
7: The percentage profile of different cells was done after identification and counting of 200 cells per slide [ 32].
