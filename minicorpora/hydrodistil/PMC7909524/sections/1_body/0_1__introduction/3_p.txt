0: The annual wormwood , Artemisia annua L. (Asterales: Asteraceae), native to temperate Asia, has been naturalized in many countries [ 12].
1: The  A. annua has traditionally been used to treat certain diseases of humans, including asthma, fever, malaria, skin diseases, jaundice, circulatory disorders, and hemorrhoids [ 13].
2: Although our previous findings of the essential oil or extracts in the vegetative stage of  A. annua showed the high potential of this medicinal plant species on insect pest control [ 14, 15, 16, 17, 18], the insecticidal effects of its floral essential oil were evaluated against  G. pyloalis in the present study.
