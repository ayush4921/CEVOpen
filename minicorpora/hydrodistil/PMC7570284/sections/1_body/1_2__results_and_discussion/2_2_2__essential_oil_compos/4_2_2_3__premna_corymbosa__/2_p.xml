<p>The major components of the leaf essential oil of 
 <italic>P. corymbosa</italic> (reported as 
 <italic>P. integrifolia</italic>) from Bangladesh were phytol (27.3%), α-humulene (14.2%), spathulenol (12.1%), 1-octen-3-ol (8.2%), eugenol (6.7%), and phenylethyl alcohol (5.8%) [
 <xref rid="B46-plants-09-01130" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Neither 1-octen-3-ol, phenylethyl alcohol, nor eugenol were detected in the samples from Vietnam. Likewise, neither α-copaene nor 
 <italic>allo</italic>-aromadendrene were reported from the Bangladeshi sample. In contrast, 
 <italic>P. corymbosa</italic> leaf essential oil (reported as 
 <italic>P. serratifolia</italic>) displayed a very simple composition of eugenol (47.9%), eugenyl acetate (9.1%), massoialactone (32.9%), and a compound identified as 
 <italic>cis</italic>-2-oxabicyclo[4.4.0]decane (12.4%) (likely incorrect based on relative retention times) [
 <xref rid="B47-plants-09-01130" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Thus, there is wide variation in the essential oil compositions of this plant, which suggests different chemotypes are possible or these three plants represent different species.
