<p>Leaves of 
 <italic>P. corymbosa</italic> were collected from two different sites (i.e., Nậm Giải Commune, Quế Phong district, Pu Hoat Nature Reserve, Nghe An province, and Son Tra Peninsula, Da Nang province). Although the two essential oil compositions are qualitatively similar, there are notable quantitative differences (
 <xref rid="plants-09-01130-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The sample from Nghe An province was rich in oxygenated sesquiterpenoids, e.g., spathulenol (17.3%) and caryophyllene oxide (16.8%), while the sample from Da Nang was dominated by sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, including 
 <italic>allo</italic>-aromadendrene (39.7%), (
 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene (13.3%), and α-copaene (8.1%).
