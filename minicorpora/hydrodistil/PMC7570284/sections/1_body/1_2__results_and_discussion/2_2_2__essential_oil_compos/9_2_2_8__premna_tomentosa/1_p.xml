<p>The leaf essential oil composition of 
 <italic>P. tomentosa</italic> is shown in 
 <xref rid="plants-09-01130-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. A total of 82 compounds were tentatively identified in the essential oil accounting for 99.8% of the composition, which was dominated by sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, especially (
 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene (22.0%) and germacrene D (11.4%). The only previous examination of the essential oil of 
 <italic>P. tomentosa</italic> is a relatively old work by Narayan and Muthana in 1953 [
 <xref rid="B48-plants-09-01130" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. These workers identified limonene (57.8%), (
 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene (17.2%), an unidentified cadinane sesquiterpene (7.8%), an unidentified sesquiterpene alcohol (5.6%), and an unidentified diterpene hydrocarbon (5.5%) in the leaf essential oil from southern India.
