<p>Compounds common to all eight of the 
 <italic>Premna</italic> leaf essential oils in this study were α-pinene, β-pinene, 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene, limonene, linalool, 
 <italic>trans</italic>-β-elemene, (
 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene, α-humulene, β-selinene, and caryophyllene oxide. These are all relatively common essential oil constituents, and therefore cannot be considered as key compounds defining the genus. Furthermore, leaf essential oils of other 
 <italic>Premna</italic> species were missing several of these components. The leaf essential oil of 
 <italic>P. coriacea</italic> from Karnataka, India, was devoid of α-pinene, β-pinene, linalool, and β-selinene [

 <italic>P. microphylla</italic> from Zhejiang Province, China, contained no α-pinene, β-pinene, linalool, (
 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene, or α-humulene [
 <xref rid="B55-plants-09-01130" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. 
 <italic>Premna integrifolia</italic> leaf essential oil from Bangladesh did not show 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene, limonene, linalool, β-elemene, or β-selinene [
 <xref rid="B46-plants-09-01130" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]; 
 <italic>P. odorata</italic> leaf oil from Giza, Egypt, showed no α-pinene, β-pinene, 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene, limonene, β-elemene, or β-selinene [
 <xref rid="B52-plants-09-01130" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]; 
 <italic>P. angolensis</italic> leaf oil from Comé, Benin, contained no β-pinene or caryophyllene oxide, and 
 <italic>P. quadrifolia</italic> from Comé, Benin, contained no α-pinene, limonene, or linalool [
 <xref rid="B51-plants-09-01130" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].
