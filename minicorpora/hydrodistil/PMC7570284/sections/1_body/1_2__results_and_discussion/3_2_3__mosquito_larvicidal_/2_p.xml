<p>The pronounced larvicidal activity of 
 <italic>P. mekongensis</italic> (Ngoc Linh) against 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> can be attributed to the high concentration of α-pinene. This monoterpene has shown larvicidal activity against 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> with LC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranging from 15.4 μg/mL to 79.1 μg/mL [
 <xref rid="B56-plants-09-01130" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Interestingly, the larvicidal activity of 
 <italic>P. mekongensis</italic> (Ngoc Linh) against 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> was less (24-h LC
 <sub>50</sub> = 42.7 μg/mL), consistent with the reduced activity of α-pinene against this mosquito larva (LC
 <sub>50</sub> = 95 μg/mL) [
