 <xref rid="B56-plants-09-01130" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]: Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010 Ultra, electron impact (EI) mode (electron energy = 70 eV), scan range = 40–400 atomic mass units, scan rate = 3.0 scans/s; ZB-5ms column (30 m length × 0.25 mm inner diameter × 0.25 μm film thickness); He carrier gas, head pressure of 552 kPa, flow rate of 1.37 mL/min; injector temperature was 250 °C, ion source temperature was 200 °C; GC oven temperature program: 50 °C initial temperature, increased 2 °C/min to 260 °C; 5% solution of essential oil in CH
