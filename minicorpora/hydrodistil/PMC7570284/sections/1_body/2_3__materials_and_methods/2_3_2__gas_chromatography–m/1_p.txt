0: The  Premna leaf essential oils were analyzed by gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GC-MS) as described previously [ 56]: Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010 Ultra, electron impact (EI) mode (electron energy = 70 eV), scan range = 40400 atomic mass units, scan rate = 3.0 scans/s; ZB-5ms column (30 m length  0.25 mm inner diameter  0.25 m film thickness); He carrier gas, head pressure of 552 kPa, flow rate of 1.37 mL/min; injector temperature was 250 C, ion source temperature was 200 C; GC oven temperature program: 50 C initial temperature, increased 2 C/min to 260 C; 5% solution of essential oil in CH 2Cl 2, 0.1 L injection, splitting ratio 30:1.
1: Putative identification of the essential oil components was based on their calculated retention indices (RI), based on a homologous series of  n-alkanes (C 8-C 40), and their mass spectral fragmentation patterns compared with those reported in the databases [ 42, 43, 44, 45], with RI values within 10 units and with matching factors >80%.
2: The concentrations of the essential oil components were calculated from raw peak areas, normalized to 100%, without standardization.
