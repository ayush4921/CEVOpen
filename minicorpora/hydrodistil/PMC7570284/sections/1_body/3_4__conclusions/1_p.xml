<p>The leaf essential oils of eight species of 
 <italic>Premna</italic> have been obtained in yields ranging from 0.10% to 0.25%. The mosquito larvicidal activities of these species have been determined for the first time and this is the first report of the essential oil compositions of 
 <italic>P. cambodiana</italic>, 
 <italic>P. flavescens</italic>, 
 <italic>P. maclurei</italic>, 
 <italic>P. mekongensis</italic>, and 
 <italic>P. puberula</italic>. The essential oil compositions were largely dominated by sesquiterpene hydrocarbons and oxygenated sesquiterpenoids. The larvicidal activities against 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> (LC
 <sub>50</sub> &lt; 65 Î¼g/mL) are promising and can probably be attributed to these components. The essential oil yields, however, are low and likely preclude their consideration as viable alternatives to other essential oils for control of mosquito vectors. However, potential utility of these essential oils will necessitate exploration of cultivation, including plant breeding aimed at increasing oil yield and/or larvicidal activity, potential detrimental effects of the essential oils on the environment, as well as field experiments on application of the essential oils, effects of environmental conditions and potential formulations on essential oil evaporation rates.
