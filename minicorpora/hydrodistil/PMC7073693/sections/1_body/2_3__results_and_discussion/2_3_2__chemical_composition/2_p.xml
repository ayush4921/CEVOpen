 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic>, a member of the family Myrtaceae, is a popular cultivated plant in Vietnam. Among the 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> species, the EO extracted from 
 <italic>Eucalyptus citriodora</italic> usually contains a high content of citronellal. In this study, the major constituents of 
 <italic>Eucalyptus citriodora</italic> oil were citronellal (78.6%), citronellol (12.1%), and isopulegol (7.2%). Plants cultivated in Brazil [

 <xref rid="B21-insects-11-00128" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] also produce EOs with a high content of citronellal. While 
 <italic>Eucalyptus citriodora</italic> is known for its high content of citronellal, 
 <italic>Eucalyptus camaldulensis</italic> is known to possess an oil rich in 1,8-cineole. In this study, the major constituents of 
 <italic>Eucalyptus camaldulensis</italic> oil were 1,8-cineol (42.6%), Î±-pinene (32.1%), and citronellyl acetate (5.6%). 
 <italic>Eucalyptus camaldulensis</italic> oils with a high content of 1,8-cineole were also reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo [
