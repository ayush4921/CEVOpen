 <xref rid="insects-11-00128-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> shows the major constituents of the EOs. Four constituents, which accounted for 97.4% of the 
 <italic>Cymbopogon citratus</italic> essential oil, were geranial (49.3%), neral (36.2%), Î²-myrcene (7.8%), and geraniol (4.1%). The high percentage of citral (85.5 %), which is a mixture of the two geometric isomers geranial and neral, is in good agreement with previous studies [

 <italic>Cymbopogon citratus</italic> is known for its high content of citral, 
 <italic>Cymbopogon winterianus</italic> is known to possess an oil rich in some monoterpenoids, such as citronellal, citronellol, geraniol, and elemol [

 <xref rid="B18-insects-11-00128" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In this study, the essential oil of 
 <italic>Cymbopogon winterianus</italic>, also known as citronella oil, mainly consists of elemol (29.5%), citronellal (23.5 %), citronellol (7.5%), and geraniol (6.1%). Citronella oil is well known for its natural mosquito repellent properties and is of great interest in the pharmaceutical, perfumery, and cosmetic industries.
