<p>Regarding the mode of action, several mechanisms through which essential oils produce neurotoxic effects have been proposed, such as EOs acting on GABA receptors, octopamine receptors, or acetylcholinesterase [

 <xref rid="B33-insects-11-00128" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Scalerandi et al. proposed an interesting mode for synergistic effects using the metabolic model [
 <xref rid="B34-insects-11-00128" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. They have shown that while the major component in the mixture is targeted by the detoxification system of the insect, the minor component intoxicates the insect. As a result, the minor component will be more toxic than when it was assayed alone since the detoxification system of the insect fights the main component.
