<p>In this study, the LC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 
 <italic>Eucalyptus citriodora</italic> essential oil was 104.4 ppm. This result is slightly higher compared to the previous findings of Vera et al. [
 <xref rid="B7-insects-11-00128" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], where the EO extracted from 
 <italic>Eucalyptus citriodora</italic> grown in Colombia had an LC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 70 ppm. In comparison with 
 <italic>Eucalyptus citriodora</italic>, 
 <italic>Eucalyptus camaldulensis</italic> essential oil had a much lower LC
 <sub>50</sub> value (33.7 ppm). This low LC
 <sub>50</sub> value was in good agreement with previous reports in which 
 <italic>Eucalyptus camaldulensis</italic> essential oil was able to induce 50% mortality at a concentration of around 30.0 Âµg/mL. [

 <sub>50</sub> = 0.026ppm) [
 <xref rid="B28-insects-11-00128" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and Neem oil formulations (LC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.7 ppm) [
 <xref rid="B29-insects-11-00128" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], the LC
 <sub>50</sub> of the four essential oils were much higher. Although these EOs show promising activity, the low efficacy of these EOs compared to commercial products has limited their application in practice.
