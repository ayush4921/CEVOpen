 <xref rid="insects-11-00128-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> shows the mosquito larvicidal activity for 
 <italic>Cymbopogon citratus, Cymbopogon winterianus, Eucalyptus citriodora,</italic> and 
 <italic>Eucalyptus camaldulensis</italic> leaf essential oils. 
 <italic>Cymbopogon citratus</italic> was the least effective EO since it has the highest value of LC
 <sub>50</sub>. This result is comparable with the results of earlier findings. Sosan et al. [
 <xref rid="B24-insects-11-00128" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and Vera et al. [
 <xref rid="B7-insects-11-00128" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] reported that 
 <italic>Cymbopogon citratus</italic> had an LC
 <sub>50</sub> of nearly 120 ppm and 123 ppm, compared to 120.6 ppm in the present study. In comparison with 
 <italic>Cymbopogon citratus</italic>, 
 <italic>Cymbopogon winterianus</italic> essential oil has a lower LC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 38.8 ppm. Mendonca et al. [
 <xref rid="B25-insects-11-00128" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] investigated an ethanol extract of 
 <italic>Cymbopogon winterianus</italic> leaves against 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> larvae and found a higher LC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 98 ppm. This result indicates that 
 <italic>Cymbopogon winterianus</italic> essential oil was more effective against 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> larvae than its ethanol extract.
