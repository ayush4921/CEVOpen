0: The analysis of all essential oils was performed using a gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GCMS) system consisting of an Agilent 6890N gas chromatograph coupled to a 5973 mass spectrometer.
1: The chromatographic separation was achieved on an HP-5MS capillary column (30 m  0.25 mm i.d.
2: 0.25 m film thickness).
3: The initial column temperature of 50 C was held for 2 min and increased by 2 C/min to 80 C; then the temperature was raised to 150 C at 5 C/min, increased to 200 C at 10 C/ min, and increased to 300 C at 20 C/ min.
4: The temperature was then held there for 5 min.
5: Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 mL/min.
6: The injector temperature was maintained at 250 C. The diluted samples (1:40 v/v in n-hexane) were injected at 1 L in splitless mode.
7: Each component was identified by using its relative retention index alongside the Wiley registry of mass spectral library and NIST MS Search.
8: The percentage composition was calculated by integrating the peak areas of the spectrograms.
