<p>The analysis of all essential oils was performed using a gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) system consisting of an Agilent 6890N gas chromatograph coupled to a 5973 mass spectrometer. The chromatographic separation was achieved on an HP-5MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d. × 0.25 μm film thickness). The initial column temperature of 50 °C was held for 2 min and increased by 2 °C/min to 80 °C; then the temperature was raised to 150 °C at 5 °C/min, increased to 200 °C at 10 °C/ min, and increased to 300 °C at 20 °C/ min. The temperature was then held there for 5 min. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The injector temperature was maintained at 250 °C. The diluted samples (1:40 v/v in n-hexane) were injected at 1 μL in splitless mode. Each component was identified by using its relative retention index alongside the Wiley registry of mass spectral library and NIST MS Search. The percentage composition was calculated by integrating the peak areas of the spectrograms. </p>
