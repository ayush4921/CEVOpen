1: The essential oils were serially diluted in ethanol to obtain the stock solutions in different concentrations.
2: Twenty-five 3rd or 4th instar larvae were introduced into cups containing 100 mL of distilled water.
3: Damaged or unhealthy larvae were replaced.
4: For each concentration, we performed tests three times.
5: Control tests were performed simultaneously with 1 mL of alcohol in distilled water.
6: The test containers were kept at 2528 C with a photoperiod of a 12:12 h light/dark cycle.
