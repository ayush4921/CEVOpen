<p>The larvicidal bioassay was carried out according to the recommendations of WHO [
 <xref rid="B12-insects-11-00128" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The essential oils were serially diluted in ethanol to obtain the stock solutions in different concentrations. Twenty-five 3rd or 4th instar larvae were introduced into cups containing 100 mL of distilled water. Damaged or unhealthy larvae were replaced. For each concentration, we performed tests three times. Control tests were performed simultaneously with 1 mL of alcohol in distilled water. The test containers were kept at 25–28 °C with a photoperiod of a 12:12 h light/dark cycle. Larval mortality was recorded after 24 h exposure.
