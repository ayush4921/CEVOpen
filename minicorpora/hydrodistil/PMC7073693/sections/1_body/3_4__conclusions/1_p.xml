<p>Our findings suggest that all the EOs exhibit toxicity to the larvae of 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, especially the essential oils of 
 <italic>Eucalyptus camaldulensis</italic> and 
 <italic>Cympobogon winterianus</italic> leaves, which may be potentially suitable for controlling mosquitoes at the larval stage. However, field evaluations and further research on the EOsâ€™ potential toxicology for non-target organisms is necessary.
