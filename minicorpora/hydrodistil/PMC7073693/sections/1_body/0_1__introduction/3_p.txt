0: Therefore, developing safe and eco-friendly insecticides is important for public health.
1: In this direction, plant essential oils (EOs) have been shown to be potential alternatives to synthetic insecticides against mosquito vectors [ 6, 7].
2: Plant-based insecticides are considered environmentally safe and have no or little effects on non-target organisms, in addition to being locally available in many parts of the world affected by mosquito-borne diseases [ 8, 9, 10].
3: Furthermore, EOs containing mixtures of active components act on insects at different target sites or with different modes of action and thus might reduce resistance in mosquito populations [ 11].
