 <p>The larvicidal activity of essential oils (EOs) extracted from 
  <italic>Cymbopogon citratus, Cymbopogon winterianus, Eucalyptus citriodora</italic>, and 
  <italic>Eucalyptus camaldulensis</italic> aromatic plants grown in Vietnam was evaluated on 
  <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> larvae. The EOs were hydro-distilled in a Clevenger-type apparatus. The EOs were analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). The mortality rates obtained from the bioassays were used to calculate the lethal concentrations (LC
  <sub>50</sub>) of the EOs by the probit analysis method. These essential oils exhibited toxicity to the larvae of 
  <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>. Results were obtained for 
  <italic>Cymbopogon citratus</italic> (LC
  <sub>50</sub> = 120.6 ppm), 
  <italic>Cymbopogon winterianus</italic> (LC
  <sub>50</sub> = 38.8 ppm), 
  <italic>Eucalyptus citriodora</italic> (LC
  <sub>50</sub> = 104.4 ppm), and 
  <italic>Eucalyptus camaldulensis</italic> (LC
  <sub>50</sub> = 33.7 ppm). The essential oils of 
  <italic>Eucalyptus camaldulensis</italic> and 
  <italic>Cymbopogon winterianus</italic> were found to be the most efficient, and their respective values of LC
  <sub>50</sub> were 33.7 ppm, 38.8 ppm. In conclusion, this research adds to the growing body of literature on natural larvicides from essential oils against 
  <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes.
