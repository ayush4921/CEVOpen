<p>Inhibition of α-amylase and α-glucosidase activity was also studied for 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> essential oil, with reported IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 4.6 and 0.1 mg/mL, respectively [
 <xref rid="B40-pharmaceuticals-13-00479" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The inhibition of these enzymes could result in the slow and prolonged release of glucose into circulation and, consequently, the retardation of sudden hyperglycemia after the consumption of a meal.
