<p>The antibacterial and antifungal activities of the essential oils and their main compounds were evaluated by several researchers. The effect of antibacterial activity of essential oils may inhibit the growth of bacteria (bacteriostatic) or destroy bacterial cells (bactericidal). Nevertheless, it is difficult to distinguish these actions, as the antibacterial activity evaluation if frequently based on the most known and basic methods such as disk-diffusion and broth microdilution for the determination of the diameter of the zone of inhibition, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), and minimum lethal concentration (MLC), and mixtures of methods, as can be seen in
