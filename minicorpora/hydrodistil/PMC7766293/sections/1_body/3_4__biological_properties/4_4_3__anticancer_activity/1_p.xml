<p>Dichloromethane and ethanol extracts from the aerial parts of 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> were evaluated regarding anticancer activity on the colon cancer cell line HCT, presenting IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 2.8 and 12 μg/mL, respectively. Additionally, one constituent of the extract, ursolic acid, was found to have an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 6.8 μg/mL, while the other compounds in the extract were inactive with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 20 μg/mL. A mixture of oleanolic and ursolic acid showed higher cytotoxicity than pure ursolic acid (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 2.8 μg/mL). The presence of these constituents identified by colon cancer cytotoxicity-guided activity indicates that 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> extracts may have a protective effect against colon cancer [
