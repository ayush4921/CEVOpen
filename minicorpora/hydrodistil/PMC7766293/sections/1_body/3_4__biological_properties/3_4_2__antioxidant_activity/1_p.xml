<p>The use of antioxidants is useful in the food industry to avoid rancidity and/or deterioration of foods [
 <xref rid="B58-pharmaceuticals-13-00479" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] and also to prevent reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, such as superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radicals. The ROS are capable of inducing lipid peroxidation, which may result in damage of membranes, lipids, lipoproteins, and induce DNA mutations that are linked to several diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, ischemia, carcinogenesis, and aging [

 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> plant extracts, essential oils, and pure compounds have been evaluated using a quite diverse number of in vitro assays, namely, those that evaluate lipid peroxidation, free radical scavenging ability, and chelating metal ions. In a study conducted by Miguel et al. [
 <xref rid="B22-pharmaceuticals-13-00479" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> essential oil, as well as its main constituents (1,8-cineole and linalool), evaluated through the peroxide values expressed as percentage of inhibition, showed antioxidant activity higher than that shown by the synthetic antioxidant butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). Nevertheless, the results cannot be explained only by some of its constituents because there may be synergistic or antagonistic effects among them. Due to the demonstrated antioxidant activity, essential oils of this species seem to be a good alternative to some synthetic antioxidants. Miguel et al. [
 <xref rid="B25-pharmaceuticals-13-00479" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] conducted another study, in which 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> essential oil was tested by a modified thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) assay in which the antioxidant capacity was evaluated measuring the ability to inhibit lipid peroxidation. In this modified TBARS assay egg yolk was used (as a lipid-rich medium) in the presence or absence of the radical inducer of lipid peroxidation, 2,2′-azobis (2 amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (ABAP). At concentrations of 62.5–500 mg/L of essential oil, the antioxidant capacity in the absence of the peroxyl radical inducer ABAP, presented values between 9.6% and 38.9% and in the presence of the peroxyl radical inducer, ABAP lower values were achieved (−19.5–16.0%). In 2007, the same research group compared the antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> essential oils, over a concentration range (160–1000 mg/L), isolated from different populations. The highest differences in the antioxidant activities of these essential oils were observed at the lowest concentration tested (160 mg/L), in which the 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> essential oil from Mértola showed the lowest activity (20%), whereas 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> essential oil from Sesimbra exhibited the highest activity (42%). Similarly, for the highest concentration tested (1000 mg/L), 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> essential oil from Mértola showed an antioxidant index of 59% and 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> essential oil from Sesimbra presented an inhibition percentage of 79%. At a concentration of 1000 mg/L, the 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> essential oils from Vila Real de Santo António and Sesimbra showed a higher ability to inhibit lipid oxidation than α-tocopherol and were within the same range of activity of BHA. In comparison with assays without ABAP, the presence of the radical inducer reduced the ability of 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> essential oils to prevent oxidation, particularly at concentrations of 160, 800, and 1000 mg/L [
