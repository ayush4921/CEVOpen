<p>Taghouti et al. [
 <xref rid="B10-pharmaceuticals-13-00479" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] showed that the 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> hydroethanolic extract presented a significantly higher scavenging activity of the ABTS radical cation (≈1.48 mmol TE/g extract) than the aqueous decoction extract (≈0.96 mmol TE/g extract). For the hydroxyl radical and nitric oxide radical scavenging assays, both extracts showed a similar capacity for scavenging. These screening assays showed that 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> extracts may be a potential source of phenolic compounds with relevant antioxidant activities, inclusively using the decoction that is the traditional method of consumption.
