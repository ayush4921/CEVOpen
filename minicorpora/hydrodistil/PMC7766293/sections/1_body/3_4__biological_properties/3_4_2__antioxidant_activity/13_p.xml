<p>The antioxidant activities of 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> essential oils have been evaluated using several complementary methods: oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) that measures the antioxidant capacity against peroxyl radicals, ABTS, DPPH, TBARS, and chelating power. The results obtained in the different methods were the following: ORAC method (163.5–735.1 mgTE/g), ABTS method (0.8–4.3 mg TE/g), DPPH assay (53.5–76.1 mg TE/kg), TBARS method (0.9–1.2 mg BHT equivalents (BHTE)/g), and chelating power (0.6–1.6 mg ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid equivalents (EDTAE)/g). In general, the different antioxidant activities were related to the individual constituents that were also tested in these assays [
