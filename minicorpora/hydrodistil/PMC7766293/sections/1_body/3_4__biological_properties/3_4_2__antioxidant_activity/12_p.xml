<p>In another study, the antioxidant activities of 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> essential oil and aqueous extract were evaluated. The essential oil in the β-carotene/linoleic acid method presented an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.622 mg/mL, while the aqueous extract presented values of 0.017 mg/mL activity. In the radical DPPH method, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were 9.052 and 0.104 mg/mL for the essential oil and aqueous extract, respectively. Finally, for the FRAP test, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values presented the same pattern (18.687 and 0.109 mg/mL for the essential oil and aqueous extract, respectively). Thus, it was clear that the extract showed higher antioxidant activity than the essential oil due to the high content of phenolic compounds in extracts [

 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> essential oil was corroborated through the DPPH radical method, FRAP assay, and β-carotene/linoleic acid system. This activity could be related to the high content of oxygenated monoterpenes (85.9%), which act as radical scavengers and ferric reducers with high activity to protect the lipid substrate [
