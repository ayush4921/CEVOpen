<p>In a study conducted by Delgado et al. [
 <xref rid="B37-pharmaceuticals-13-00479" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], the DPPH and FRAP assays of the methanolic extracts and essential oils from 20 different populations were examined. All methanolic extracts and essential oils presented a similar concentration-dependent pattern, increasing the scavenging activity against DPPH with the increase in concentration. However, much higher DPPH radical scavenging abilities were obtained with the methanolic extracts than with the essential oils. The results of the inhibition of DPPH radicals ranged between 86.6% and 93.9% when the highest methanolic extract concentration was used. In contrast, the essential oils of 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> presented a much lower DPPH radical scavenging activity, varying between 30.8% and 57.7%, even when the highest concentration was used. Relative to the reductive power assay, it was only determined for the methanolic extracts because it was not possible to perform the assay correctly with the essential oils. Interestingly, in this study, the authors tried to relate the antioxidant activity to their chemical composition. In fact, 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> methanolic extracts were rich in rosmarinic acid, which is a polyphenol carboxylic acid, known for possessing antioxidant activity, whereas the essential oils had low contents of thymol, among others, that could explain the low antioxidant activity.
