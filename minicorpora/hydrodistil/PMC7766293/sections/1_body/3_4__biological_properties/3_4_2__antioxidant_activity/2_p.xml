<p>In a study conducted by Galego et al. [
 <xref rid="B31-pharmaceuticals-13-00479" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], the antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> essential oil was determined using different methods, such as TBARS, measuring the scavenging effect of the substances on the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radicals, determining the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) based on the principle that substances, which have reduction potential, react with potassium ferricyanide (Fe
 <sup>3+</sup>) to form potassium ferrocyanide (Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>), which then reacts with ferric chloride to form ferricâ€“ferrous complex, and also monitoring the chelating effect on ferrous ions (Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>). The results showed that even at higher concentrations of 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> essential oil (1000 mg/L), the antioxidant index was around 50% as observed with the TBARS method, while for the synthetic antioxidants, BHA and BHT, the antioxidant index was approximately 100%. In other methods, the difference between the activity of the essential oil and synthetic antioxidants BHA and BHT was more accentuated showing lesser antioxidant activity.
