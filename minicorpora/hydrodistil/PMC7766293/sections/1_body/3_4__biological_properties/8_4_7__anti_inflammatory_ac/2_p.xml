<p>Albano and Miguel [
 <xref rid="B50-pharmaceuticals-13-00479" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] evaluated the 5-LOX activity of deodorized (divided into three fractions: the first one suspended in methanol; the second fractionated with water and chloroform; the third with chloroform), organic (diethyl ether, ethyl ether, and 
 <italic>n</italic>-butanol), and aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic>. This study reported that lower IC
 <sub>50</sub> values (12.2 μg/mL) were obtained for the water-insoluble deodorized chloroformic fraction of deodorized extract. In contrast, a higher IC
 <sub>50</sub> was obtained using diethyl ether, with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 62.5 μg/mL. Finally, for the deodorized fraction suspended in methanol and the aqueous extract, it was not possible to determine the IC
 <sub>50</sub>. For most of these extracts in the 5-LOX assay, there was a correlation between phenol content and IC
 <sub>50</sub> values, meaning that a higher phenolic content in the extract resulted in a lower 5-LOX activity.
