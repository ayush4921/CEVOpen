 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> has been traditionally used as a flavoring for food and in the treatment of health conditions due to its antiseptic, digestive, antirheumatic, and antitussive effects. Regarding the biological activities reported in different studies, 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> essential oil and/or extracts also have antibacterial, antifungal, antioxidant, insecticide, repellent, antiviral, anti-Alzheimer, and anti-inflammatory activities. The antibacterial and antifungal activities of 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> are an important characteristic for the use of these plants for production as natural antimicrobial agents that could be used as preservatives against diverse Gram-positive and negative bacteria and fungi. In addition, the antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> was also largely explored through different assays, representing an interesting alternative to synthetic antioxidants. Although little attention has been paid to other activities, such as insecticide, repellent, antiviral, anti-Alzheimer, and anti-inflammatory activities, 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> also showed interesting potential for these activities. In some studies, these effects were related to the composition and were tested to understand if some compounds were primarily responsible for the observed activity.
