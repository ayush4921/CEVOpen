0: The AChE inhibitory activity was measured using the spectrophotometric method developed by Ellman, et al.
1: [ 61], with slight modifications as suggested by Rhee, et al.
2: [ 62].
3: Acetylthiocholine was used as the substrate to detect the inhibition of AChE.
4: The reaction mixture contained 40 L of Buffer C (TrisHCl, 50 mM, pH 8, containing 0.1 M of sodium chloride and 0.02 M of magnesium chloride hexahydrate), 20 L of the tested sample solution, 20 L of AcSCh (15 mM, PBS pH 7.4), and 100 L of DTNB (3 Mm, dissolved in Buffer C).
5: The mixture was pre-incubated for 3 min at 25 C. Finally, the enzymatic reaction was started with the addition of 20 L of 0.5 U/mL AChE (137 U/mg solid) and then incubated at 25 C for 30 min.
6: The amount of product released was monitored in an EPOCH 2 (BIOTEK  ) microplate reader every 1 min at 405 nm.
7: All reactions were performed in triplicate in a 96-well microplate.
8: Tested sample solutions from the essential oil were made by dissolving 10 mg in 1 mL MeOH.
9: Two more dilutions were included in MEOH (10 dilution) to obtain final concentrations (1000, 100, and 10 ug/mL) of essential oil in MeOH.
10: The IC 50 value was calculated by curve fitting of data (non-linear regression analysis, PRISM 8.0.1, GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA).
11: Donepezil was used as positive control.
12: Any increase in absorbance because of spontaneous hydrolysis of the substrate was corrected by subtracting the absorbance at the end of pre-incubation from the absorbance measured after the addition of the enzyme.
13: The IC 50 value was measured from the corresponding rate of the reaction curve with Graph Pad v8.0.1.5.
