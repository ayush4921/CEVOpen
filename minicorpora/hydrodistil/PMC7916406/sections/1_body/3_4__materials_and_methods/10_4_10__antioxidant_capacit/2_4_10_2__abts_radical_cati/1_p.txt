0: The ABTS antioxidant method was performed according the modifications of Thaipong et al.
1: [ 59] to the initial procedure described by Arnao et al.
2: [ 60].
3: Briefly, the ABTS radical cation (ABTS+) was produced after the reaction for 12 h of equal volumes of two stock solutions (7.4 M ABTS and 2.6 M potassium persulfate).
4: After that, an ABTS standard solution was prepared by dissolution in methanol until reaching an absorbance of 1.1  0.02, at a wavelength of 734 nm.
5: The antiradical evaluation was evaluated when 2850 L of the ABTS standard solution was allowed to react with 150 L of the  P. carpunya essential oil at different concentrations, at room temperature, and protected from light for 2 h. Then, the final absorbance was registered.
6: Similar to the DPPH analysis, BHT and Trolox were used as positive controls, while deionized water was used as blank control.
7: ABTS radical scavenging activity was calculated by: SA (%) = (Ao  Ai)/Ao * 100%, where Ao represents the absorbance of the ABTS+ reaction with the blank control, and Ai is the final absorbance of ABTS+ after reacting with the essential oil or positive controls.
8: The SC 50 was determined by comparing the graph of SA (%) against the concentration of essential oil.
9: Every analysis was performed in triplicate and the average value was reported.
