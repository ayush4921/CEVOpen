0: The free radical-scavenging capacity was expressed as percentage and was calculated by: R (%) = [(As  Ai)/As] * 100%, where Ai represents the final absorbance of the DPPH after reacting with essential oil or positive controls, and As is the absorbance of the DPPH reaction with the blank control.
1: The plotting of R (%) against the concentration of the essential oil allowed us to identify the oil concentration that provided 50% scavenging effect (SC 50) of DPPH free radicals.
2: All measurements were performed in triplicate and reported as the average value.
