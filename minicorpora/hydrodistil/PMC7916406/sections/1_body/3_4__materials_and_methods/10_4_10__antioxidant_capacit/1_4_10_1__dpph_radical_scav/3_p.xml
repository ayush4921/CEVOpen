<p>The free radical-scavenging capacity was expressed as percentage and was calculated by: R (%) = [(As âˆ’ Ai)/As] * 100%, where Ai represents the final absorbance of the DPPH after reacting with essential oil or positive controls, and As is the absorbance of the DPPH reaction with the blank control. The plotting of R (%) against the concentration of the essential oil allowed us to identify the oil concentration that provided 50% scavenging effect (SC
 <sub>50</sub>) of DPPH free radicals. All measurements were performed in triplicate and reported as the average value.
