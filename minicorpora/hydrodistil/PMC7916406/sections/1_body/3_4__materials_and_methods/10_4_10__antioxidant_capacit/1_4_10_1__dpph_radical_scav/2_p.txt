0: The procedure was performed according to Brand Williams et al.
1: [ 58] and Thaipong et al.
2: [ 59].
3: The method consists in the preparation of a stable solution of DPPH with methanol until the absorbance is adjusted to 1.1  0.02 units at a wavelength of 515 nm in a UV spectrophotometer (Genesys 10S UV.Vis Spectrophotometer, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).
4: For the antiradical evaluation, 2850 L of DPPH solution were allowed to react with 150 L of  P. carpunya essential oil at different concentrations, at room temperature and protected from light for 24 h. After that, the final absorbance was measured at the same wavelength.
5: The same procedure was followed for positive controls BHT and Trolox, while methanol was used as a blank control.
