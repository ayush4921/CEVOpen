0: The quantitative and qualitative identification of the volatile secondary metabolites present in  Piper carpunya leaves and guaviduca beverage was carried out using gas chromatography (GC).
1: Quantitative analyses were carry out using an Agilent gas chromatograph (model 6890N series) equipped with a flame ionization detector (GC/FID) according to the procedure described by Valarezo et al.
2: [ 53].
3: The relative amounts of individual components were calculated based on the GC peak area (FID response) without using a correction factor.
4: For quantitative analysis, an external calibration curve was used.
5: The calibration curve was obtained by injecting six dilutions of limonene.
6: The dilutions were obtained by diluting 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 5, and 10 mg of limonene to 10 mL with dichloromethane.
7: The calibration curve achieved a R 2 > 0.99.
8: Qualitative analyses were performed using an Agilent gas chromatograph (model 6890N series, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) coupled to a mass spectrometer (quadrupole) detector (model Agilent series 5973 inert) (GC/MS) (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) as per the procedures described earlier by Valarezo et al.
9: [ 53].
10: Identification of the constituents was carried out by comparing the retention index (RI) and mass spectral data (MS) with those in the literature [ 54, 55, 56].
11: For qualitative and quantitative analyses, an automatic injector (Agilent 7683 automatic liquid sampler, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and a nonpolar column (J&W DB-5ms Ultra Inert GC column: 30 m  0.25 mm  0.25 m; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) were used.
