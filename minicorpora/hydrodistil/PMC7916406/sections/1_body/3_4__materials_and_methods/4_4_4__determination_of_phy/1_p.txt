0: Three physical properties were determined for the essential oil: relative density, refractive index, and optical rotation.
1: The standard AFNOR NF T 75-111 [ 52] (equivalent to the standard ISO 279:1998) was used to determine the relative density, the standard AFNOR NF T 75-112 [ 52] (similar to ISO 279:1998) for the refractive index, and the standard method ISO 592:1998 for optical rotation.
2: For relative density, an analytical balance (model Mettler AC 100, 0.0001) and a pycnometer (1 mL) were used; for refraction index, a refractometer (model ABBE) was used; and for optical rotation, an automatic polarimeter (model Mrc-P810) was used.
3: Measurements were performed at 20 C and repeated three times.
