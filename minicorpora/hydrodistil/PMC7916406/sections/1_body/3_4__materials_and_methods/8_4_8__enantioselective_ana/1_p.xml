<p>For enantioselective analysis, an Agilent gas chromatograph (model 6890N series) was used coupled to a mass spectrometer detector (quadrupole model Agilent series 5973 inert) using an enantioselective column with a stationary phase (2,3-diethyl-6-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-β-cyclodextrin). The chromatographic run was performed with a temperature ramp of 2 °C/min from 50 °C (mainatined for 2 min) to 220 °C (mainatined for 2 min).</p>
