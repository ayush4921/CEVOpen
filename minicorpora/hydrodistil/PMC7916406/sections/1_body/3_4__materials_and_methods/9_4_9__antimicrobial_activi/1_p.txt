0: Antimicrobial activity was determined against five Gram-negative bacteria ( Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853),  Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC 9997),  Proteus vulgaris (ATCC 8427),  Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922),  Salmonella typhimurium (LT2)) and two Gram-positive bacteria ( Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212) and  Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923)), according to the procedure previously described by Valarezo et al.
1: [ 57].
2: The bacterial strains were incubated in MuellerHinton (MH) broth and DMSO was used to dissolve the essential oil.
3: Gentamicine was used as a positive control for  P. aeruginosa,  K. pneumonia,  P. vulgaris,  E. coli,  S. aureus, and ampicilline for  E. faecalis and  S. typhimurium.
4: DMSO was used as a negative control and the results are reported as minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) (the lowest concentration of sample capable of inhibiting all visible signs of growth of the microorganism).
