<p>Through hydrodistillation in a Clevenger-type apparatus, we obtained ~40 mL of essential oil (EO) from 5000 g of

 <italic>w</italic>) (a mean of nine samples: three distillations x three collections) or 8.1 mL/Kg, which is considered as an intermediate yield [
 <xref rid="B15-plants-10-00338" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], in reference to fresh plant material (68 ± 4% of moisture). The essential oil was a viscous liquid of subjective greenish-yellow color (RGB values of R:154, G:205, B:50 and CMYK values of C:0.25, M:0, Y:0.76, K:0.2). The essential oil’s relative density was
