<p>The identification of compounds present in the 
 <italic>Piper carpunya</italic> essential oil collected in the Ecuadorian Amazon and in the guaviduca beverage was carried out using mass spectral (MS) and retention index (RI) data. The results are summarized in 
 <xref rid="plants-10-00338-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Considering that the guaviduca beverage is prepared and consumed throughout the year, the essential oil of the species collected in winter and summer was studied. The collections were performed every 15 days during two months for each season, in that way the variation in chemical composition was the greatest possible.
