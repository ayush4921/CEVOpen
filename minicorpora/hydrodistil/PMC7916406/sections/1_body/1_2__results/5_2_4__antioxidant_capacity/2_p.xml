<p>Through the DPPH method, the essential oils studied showed little antioxidant activity (12% of radical scavenge to 1000 ppm), and it was not possible to determine the SC
 <sub>50</sub> values (&gt;1000 μg/mL) at those concentrations. The SC
 <sub>50</sub> for BHT and Trolox was close, but BHT (SC
 <sub>50</sub> = 440 ± 30 μg/mL) was the most efficient. Employing the ABTS technique, an inhibition of 22% was obtained with 1000 ppm; however, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> not was reached at the concentration ranges tested (
