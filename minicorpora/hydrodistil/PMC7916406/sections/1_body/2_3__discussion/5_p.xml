<p>The antibacterial capacity against 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> of the 
 <italic>P. carpunya</italic> EO may be due to its high concentration in 1,8-cineole, which has been reported as a compound with antibacterial capacity [
 <xref rid="B37-plants-10-00338" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Furthermore, 1,8-cineole showed significant levels of synergistic interaction when combined with antimicrobial compounds such as chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic>, and 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> [
 <xref rid="B38-plants-10-00338" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. On the other hand, it has been determined that essential oils with a high safrole content (75–85%) such as that extracted from 
 <italic>Piper xylosteoides</italic> [
 <xref rid="B39-plants-10-00338" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and that from 
 <italic>Piper hispidinervum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B40-plants-10-00338" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,
 <xref rid="B41-plants-10-00338" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] present weak activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Azuero, et al. [
 <xref rid="B42-plants-10-00338" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] evaluated the antimicrobial effect of methanolic extracts of 
 <italic>P. carpunya</italic> leaves and determined a high antibacterial effect against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and a weak effect against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>; however, no effect against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> was determined. In the same study, 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>carpunya</italic> showed a high fungicidal action against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Quílez et al. [
 <xref rid="B12-plants-10-00338" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] isolated different compounds from an ethanolic extract, and the identified compounds were reported to present antibacterial activity [
 <xref rid="B43-plants-10-00338" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,
 <xref rid="B44-plants-10-00338" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,
