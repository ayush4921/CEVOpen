<p>Since the direct addition of aromatic plants in dry form in PDA media is impossible due to the inherent microbial load that the dry material carries, the dry form was mixed with the PDA before sterilization and subsequently sterilized at 121 °C for 20 min. Thus, the amount of phenolic compounds extracted from the dry mater in the aqueous solution was analyzed and linked with the antifungal activity of the aromatic plant in PDA. The profile and the amount of phenolic compounds in the aqueous solution autoclaved for 20 min at 121 °C is shown in 
 <xref rid="foods-09-01642-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. It was observed that the highest number of phenolic compounds were present in the oregano aqueous solution, followed by Satureja and thyme. In general, aqueous solutions were rich in the phenolic compounds carvacrol and rosmarinic acid. The total amount of phenolic compounds in oregano, thyme and Satureja was 204.83, 121.99 and 156.82 µg/mL, respectively. This amount (if converted to dry matter) is higher compared to the respective amount reported in the literature for water-soluble phenolics from oregano, thyme and Satureja [
 <xref rid="B19-foods-09-01642" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. It appears that although some compounds (i.e., ferulic acid, sinapic acid, p-coumaric acid and trans-cinnamic acid) were negatively affected by sterilization at 121 °C, the extracted amount of other phenolic compounds was higher, suggesting a high sensitivity for these compounds to high temperature.
