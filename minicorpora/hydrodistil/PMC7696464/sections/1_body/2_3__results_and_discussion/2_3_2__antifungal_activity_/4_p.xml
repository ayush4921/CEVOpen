<p>Although a significant increase in the fungal surface with increasing storage was observed, thyme exhibited a higher inhibition effect, followed by oregano and Satureja. In general, the aromatic plants were significantly more efficient in inhibiting the 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> species than 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic>. It seems that at 0.5%, the dry aromatic plants encouraged 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> growth since it was observed that the overall mean was significantly higher than that of the control. Contrary, the aromatic plants were effective in inhibiting the growth of 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> at the concentrations used.
