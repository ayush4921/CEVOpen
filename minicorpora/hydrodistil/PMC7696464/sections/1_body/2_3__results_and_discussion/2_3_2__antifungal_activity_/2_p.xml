<p>The results of the antifungal activity of the studied aromatic plants in the dry form on PDA medium are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-09-01642-f001">Figure 1</xref>. In general, the higher the content of aromatic plant, the higher the inhibition for each fungus studied. No fungal (
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic>, 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic>) growth was observed after two days of storage at the highest concentration (1%) for all the aromatic plants studied. At the concentration of 0.5%, thyme efficiently inhibited 100% of the 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> and 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> growth, while oregano and Satureja inhibited 91.92% and 92.10% of 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> growth, and 60.94% and 81.54% of 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> growth, respectively.
