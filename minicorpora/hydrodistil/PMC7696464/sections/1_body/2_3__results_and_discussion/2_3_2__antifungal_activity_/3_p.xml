<p>After five days of storage, the maximum (95.03%) and minimum (12.92%) inhibition of 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> was recorded for thyme 1% and Satureja 0.5%, respectively. After eight days of storage, two Satureja samples (at 0.5% and 1%) and oregano at 0.5% showed that the surface occupied by the 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> colony was greater than that of the respective control (no added dry aromatic plants after eight days of storage). It seems that 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> growth was inhibited from a minimum of 39.82% (Satureja 0.5%) to a maximum of 89.15% (thyme 1%) in all PDA samples. After 12 days of storage, only PDA with thyme showed 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> colony surfaces similar to that of the respective control, with the rest of the samples showing significantly higher values (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-09-01642-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). It seems that beyond this period, the addition of the aromatic plants promotes the growth of 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic>. Both PDA samples with thyme and the sample with oregano 1% inhibited the growth of 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> after 12 days of storage, whereas Satureja at 1% and oregano at 0.5% exhibited similar values to that of the control (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-09-01642-f001">Figure 1</xref>A). Only Satureja at 0.5% showed a colony surface area higher than the control.
