 <xref rid="foods-09-01642-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> reveals that the essential oil of oregano consisted mainly of monoterpene phenolic compounds (82.64%), monoterpene hydrocarbons (12.61%) and fewer sesquiterpenes (2.14%) and other oxygenated monoterpenes (1.12%). The main component is carvacrol (82.48%), followed by p-cymene (5.00%), and γ-terpinene (2.62%). Other major components are β-mycene (1.61%), followed by trans-caryophyllene (1.23%), α-terpinene (0.97%) and β-bisabolene (0.91%). The amount of carvacrol in our samples is significantly higher (82.48% vs. 59.7%) than those that Lagouri et al. [
 <xref rid="B26-foods-09-01642" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] found in a sample of Greek oregano, whereas the amount of thymol was significantly lower (0.16% vs. 13.70%). The species 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> ssp. 
 <italic>hirtum</italic>, also known as Greek oregano, is widely distributed throughout the Mediterranean basin [
 <xref rid="B27-foods-09-01642" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Analysis of the composition of its essential oil, as reported in the literature, showed that the main components are carvacrol accompanied by two monoterpenic hydrocarbons, p-cymene and γ-terpine. Carvacrol and thymol participate in giving the plant its aroma. Generally, the amounts of carvacrol and thymol are negatively correlated. The same applies between their sum and the sum of the two monoterpenic hydrocarbons [
