<p>The antimicrobial activity of the aqueous extract of aromatic plants may be attributed to the high content of phenolics. Among the compounds present in aromatic plants, carvacrol and thymol are recognized for their strong antifungal effect. They damage cell membranes by interacting with sterols, in particular with ergosterol [
