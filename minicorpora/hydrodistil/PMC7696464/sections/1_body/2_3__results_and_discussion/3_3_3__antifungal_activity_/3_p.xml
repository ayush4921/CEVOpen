<p>Plant phenolics, together with terpenoids, alkaloids, and lectins and polypeptides, are recognized to have antimicrobial properties [
 <xref rid="B36-foods-09-01642" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Phenolic and flavonoid compounds possess both antifungal and antimicrobial activity [
 <xref rid="B37-foods-09-01642" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="B38-foods-09-01642" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="B39-foods-09-01642" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Flavonoids have been reported to be involved in the inhibition of nucleic acid biosynthesis and other metabolic processes [
 <xref rid="B40-foods-09-01642" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], as well as in the inhibition of the spore germination of plant pathogens [
 <xref rid="B41-foods-09-01642" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Moreover, flavonoids are synthesized by plants in response to microbial infection. Phenolic compounds with a C3 side chain at a lower level of oxidation and containing no oxygen groups have often been reported to be antimicrobials [
 <xref rid="B42-foods-09-01642" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Based on previously published data [

 <xref rid="B20-foods-09-01642" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], it was expected that the inhibition of fungi should vary in the following range: oregano &gt; thyme &gt; Satureja, since total phenolics among the raw dry aromatic plants and in bread vary in this order (402.19, 379.49 and 357.24 μg/g bread, respectively). When added in dry form, theoretically, oregano should have shown the highest inhibition level, whereas Satureja should have shown the lowest. It seems that the profile of phenolic compounds, especially the amount of flavonoids that enriched the bread recipe, could affect the level of inhibition. Indeed, bread made with thyme (76.85 μg/g bread) showed the highest level of flavonoids compared to Satureja (72.99 μg/g bread) and oregano (41.05 μg/g bread) [
 <xref rid="B20-foods-09-01642" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Thus, the final effect on the inhibition of fungi is a result of the combination of the profile of phenolic compounds with the level of each compound present.
