<p>The antifungal properties of dry aromatic plants and their respective essential oils in bread are presented in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-09-01642-f003">Figure 3</xref>. The addition of aromatic plants (dry matter as well as essential oil) in the bread recipe resulted in antifungal activity against both 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> and 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic>. Other recent studies have examined the use of essential oils in order to extend the shelf-life of bread. The authors of [
 <xref rid="B32-foods-09-01642" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="B33-foods-09-01642" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] used starch microcapsules containing essential oils (citral and eugenol) to inhibit 
 <italic>P. roqueforti</italic> and 
 <italic>A. niger</italic> and extended the shelf life of bread. On the other hand, Gonçalves da Rosa et al. [
 <xref rid="B33-foods-09-01642" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] observed that the addition of essential oils from 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare Linneus</italic> and 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> incorporated in nanocapsules also extended the shelf life of bread. Both studies demonstrated that the inclusion of essential oils in nanocapsules before their incorporation in the bread recipe represents a great potential for the preservation of baked foods. In the study by Vasileva et al. [
 <xref rid="B34-foods-09-01642" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], the breads with 2.5% and 5% added lavender (
 <italic>Lavandula angustifolia</italic>) waste had increased shelf life compared to control bread without added plant waste, showing no fungal or bacterial spoilage for four days, indicating its potential as a bread preservative. They observed that there was no difference in antimicrobial/antifungal activity among the two levels of addition. In the present study, it was observed that the level of addition played a significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) effect in decreasing the fungal colony surface, regardless of the type of fungus. The higher the level of addition, the higher the inhibition effect against the fungi. Among the aromatic plants, thyme had significant antifungal activity, with values of 53.34–71.15%, which was the greatest activity observed against 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> when added in the bread recipe in dry form and the least against 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> when added as an essential oil. On the other hand, Satureja exhibited the lowest inhibition values against both fungi among the three aromatic plants. A general linear model applied to these data revealed that both forms of addition (essential oil and dry material) had the greatest activity (significance 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.5) against 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> compared to 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic>. In general, when the aromatic plants are added in the dry form in the bread recipe, they were more effective compared to essential oils.
