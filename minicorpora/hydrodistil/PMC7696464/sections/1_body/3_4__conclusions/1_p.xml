<p>Growth inhibitory potential against fungi by incorporating aromatic plants (in dry form or as essential oils) in food systems represent a very interesting approach that holds economic value. The enrichment of a bread recipe with aromatic plants, not only added as essential oils but also in dry form, could inhibit the mycelial growth of 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> and 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> fungi at a concentration range where the breads are considered acceptable based on sensory tests. It was observed that aromatic plants were more efficient in the inhibition of the growth of 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> compared to 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic>. This presents an advantage since 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> represents the primary fungal contaminant of bread. Moreover, the addition of aromatic plants in the dry form in the bread recipe is more effective against both fungi studied compared to essential oils. However, further research is needed to evaluate the effect of bread recipe and processing parameters on the inhibition effect in order to further augment it. In conclusion, at the levels used in this stidy, aromatic plants in dry form or as essential oils may be useful as natural and safe additives for promoting the safety and quality of ready-to-eat bread.
