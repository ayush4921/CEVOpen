<p>The objective of the present work was to explore the antifungal activities of three aromatic plants (in the dry form) common to the Mediterranean area, and widely used as spices (
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> ssp. 
 <italic>hirtum</italic> (oregano), 
 <italic>Thymus capitatus</italic> (thyme) and 
 <italic>Satureja thymbra</italic> (Satureja)) in potato dextrose agar (PDA) against two fungi, 
 <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> van Tieghem (BPIC 2539) and 
 <italic>Penicillium,</italic> isolated from bread. Moreover, the antifungal activities of the selected plants (when added as essential oil or in dry form) in a bread matrix were also studied, while possible relationships were evaluated between the components of oregano, thyme and Satureja and their antifungal activity. Finally, our breadmaking trials determined, for the first time, the extent of inhibition that these aromatic plants have when applied in bread at concentrations that are acceptable from a sensorialâ€“organoleptic point of view, as established in one our previous studies [
