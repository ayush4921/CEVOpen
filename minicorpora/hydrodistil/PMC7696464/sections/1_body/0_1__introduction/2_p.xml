 <italic>Lamiaceae</italic> family, is known to act as a natural preservative [

 <xref rid="B16-foods-09-01642" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. It was reported that carvacrol interacts with the membrane of bacteria by changing its permeability, resulting in the dissipation of ion gradients that in turn leads to impairment of essential processes in the cell, resulting in cell death. On the other hand, carvacrol does not exhibit adverse effects on human health, since the levels at which it exhibits its antimicrobial activity are not toxic at the cellular level [
