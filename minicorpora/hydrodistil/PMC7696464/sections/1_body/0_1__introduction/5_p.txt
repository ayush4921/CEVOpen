0: The objective of the present work was to explore the antifungal activities of three aromatic plants (in the dry form) common to the Mediterranean area, and widely used as spices ( Origanum vulgare ssp.
1: hirtum (oregano),  Thymus capitatus (thyme) and  Satureja thymbra (Satureja)) in potato dextrose agar (PDA) against two fungi,  Aspergillus niger van Tieghem (BPIC 2539) and  Penicillium, isolated from bread.
2: Moreover, the antifungal activities of the selected plants (when added as essential oil or in dry form) in a bread matrix were also studied, while possible relationships were evaluated between the components of oregano, thyme and Satureja and their antifungal activity.
3: Finally, our breadmaking trials determined, for the first time, the extent of inhibition that these aromatic plants have when applied in bread at concentrations that are acceptable from a sensorialorganoleptic point of view, as established in one our previous studies [ 20].
