0: The essential oils of the  Lamiaceae family have been extensively studied with respect to their use as food preservatives [ 1, 6, 7], and among them, oregano and thyme are of major importance due to their antimicrobial and antifungal activities [ 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12].
1: Essential oils are usually extracted from plants by steam distillation, and they contain a variety of volatile molecules such as terpenes and terpenoids, phenol-derived aromatic components, as well as aliphatic compounds [ 13, 14].
2: Carvacrol, an essential oil compound present in several taxa of the  Lamiaceae family, is known to act as a natural preservative [ 15, 16].
3: It was reported that carvacrol interacts with the membrane of bacteria by changing its permeability, resulting in the dissipation of ion gradients that in turn leads to impairment of essential processes in the cell, resulting in cell death.
4: On the other hand, carvacrol does not exhibit adverse effects on human health, since the levels at which it exhibits its antimicrobial activity are not toxic at the cellular level [ 17].
