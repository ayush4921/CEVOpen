0: The effect of the addition of 1% dry aromatic plants on  Aspergillus niger and  Penicillium growth was determined on petri plates with PDA media.
1: PDA was prepared in 400 mL aliquots.
2: The amount of dry aromatic plants to obtain concentrations of 0.5% and 1% (w/v) were added to PDA before water addition, and then the suspension was autoclaved at 121 C for 20 min.
3: After cooling to 45 C, the solutions containing PDA alone or with the added dry aromatic plants were poured into sterile petri plates.
4: Care was taken to ensure that the suspended particles of aromatic plants were evenly distributed within the petri plates.
