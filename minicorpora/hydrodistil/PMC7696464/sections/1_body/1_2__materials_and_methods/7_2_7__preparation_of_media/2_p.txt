0: The fungal conidia that were sub-cultured for 7 days on plates with PDA for mass production were collected by scraping the conidial layers formed on the plate surface using a sterilized scalpel [ 21, 25].
1: Preparation of the fungal spore suspension was made with spores that were harvested with a sterile loop in sterile distilled water and aseptically transferred into sterile test tubes [ 21].
2: The spore suspensions were adjusted to give a final spore concentration of 15  10 6 spores/mL using a hemocytometer.
