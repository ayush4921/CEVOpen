<p>The effect of the addition of 1% dry aromatic plants on 
 <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> and 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> growth was determined on petri plates with PDA media. PDA was prepared in 400 mL aliquots. The amount of dry aromatic plants to obtain concentrations of 0.5% and 1% (w/v) were added to PDA before water addition, and then the suspension was autoclaved at 121 °C for 20 min. After cooling to 45 °C, the solutions containing PDA alone or with the added dry aromatic plants were poured into sterile petri plates. Care was taken to ensure that the suspended particles of aromatic plants were evenly distributed within the petri plates.
