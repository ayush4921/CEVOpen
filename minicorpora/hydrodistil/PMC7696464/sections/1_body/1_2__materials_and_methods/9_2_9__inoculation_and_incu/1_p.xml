<p>Bread samples, 8 cm in diameter and 12.5 mm in thickness (whole slice) in Petri dishes, were exposed to ultraviolet light for 30 min and then inoculated with 10 µL of the suspension containing 15 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> spores/mL. The bread inoculated with fungal spores were sealed with parafilm and then incubated at 25 °C for 10 days. The determination was done for at least 12 biological replicates (bread slices in petri dishes). A high-resolution photo of each bread slice was analyzed similarly to
