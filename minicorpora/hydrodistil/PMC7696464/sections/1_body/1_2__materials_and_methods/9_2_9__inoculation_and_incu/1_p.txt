0: Bread samples, 8 cm in diameter and 12.5 mm in thickness (whole slice) in Petri dishes, were exposed to ultraviolet light for 30 min and then inoculated with 10 L of the suspension containing 15  10 6 spores/mL.
1: The bread inoculated with fungal spores were sealed with parafilm and then incubated at 25 C for 10 days.
2: The determination was done for at least 12 biological replicates (bread slices in petri dishes).
3: A high-resolution photo of each bread slice was analyzed similarly to  Section 2.8.
