0: The recipe and breadmaking procedure is described in detail elsewhere [ 20].
1: The recipe for bread production consisted of wheat flour (300 g), salt (6 g), dry yeast (5 g), water (49.3% on flour basis), and dried aromatic plants at four different levels (0%, 0.25%, 0.5% and 1% in 100 g flour basis) or essential oil at four addition levels (0, 12.5, 25, and 50 L).
2: All ingredients were mixed for 5 min in a farinograph bowl and then a two-step bulk fermentation (3032 C) and proofing up to the optimum volume was performed.
3: Bread loaves were baked for at least 23 min at 210 C then cooled for at least one hour at room temperature, sealed in polyethylene bags, and stored in the freezer.
4: Before the test, bread loaves were allowed to reach room temperature and were then immediately sliced and sized, and finally placed in petri dishes.
5: The level of aromatic plants and essential oil added in the present study was determined by the results of sensory tests performed and described elsewhere [ 20].
