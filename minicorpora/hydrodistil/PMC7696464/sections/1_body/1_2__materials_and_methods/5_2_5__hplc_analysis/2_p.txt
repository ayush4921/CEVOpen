0: Phenolic compounds in the water extract were separated in a Nucleosil 100 C18 5 m (250 mm  4.6 mm) column maintained at 30 C as explained in detail elsewhere [ 19].
1: The extracts were analyzed for the presence of 24 phenolics at least in duplicate and the results were expressed as micrograms per g (g/g).
2: The phenolic compounds were detected utilizing a diode-array detector (DAD) at different wavelengths as follows: 260 nm for protocatechuic acid (PRCA), 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (4-HBA), vanillic acid (VA) and rutin (RUT); 270 nm for gallic acid (GA), ()-epigallocatechine (EPIG) and syringic acid (SRA); 280 nm for (+)-catechin (CAT), ()-epicatechin (EPI), trans-cinnamic acid (CIN), ()-naringenin (NAR), carvacrol (CAR) and thymol (THY); 320 nm for caffeic acid (CA), p-coumaric acid (PCA), ferulic acid (FA) and sinapic acid (SA); 330 nm for chlorogenic acid (CLA), rosmarinic acid (RMA) and kaempferol (KAM); and 360 nm for myricetin (MYR), quercetin (QUE), luteolin (LUT) and apigenin (API).
