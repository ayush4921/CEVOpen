<p>Phenolic compounds in the water extract were separated in a Nucleosil 100 C18 5 µm (250 mm × 4.6 mm) column maintained at 30 °C as explained in detail elsewhere [
 <xref rid="B19-foods-09-01642" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The extracts were analyzed for the presence of 24 phenolics at least in duplicate and the results were expressed as micrograms per g (µg/g). The phenolic compounds were detected utilizing a diode-array detector (DAD) at different wavelengths as follows: 260 nm for protocatechuic acid (PRCA), 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (4-HBA), vanillic acid (VA) and rutin (RUT); 270 nm for gallic acid (GA), (−)-epigallocatechine (EPIG) and syringic acid (SRA); 280 nm for (+)-catechin (CAT), (−)-epicatechin (EPI), trans-cinnamic acid (CIN), (±)-naringenin (NAR), carvacrol (CAR) and thymol (THY); 320 nm for caffeic acid (CA), p-coumaric acid (PCA), ferulic acid (FA) and sinapic acid (SA); 330 nm for chlorogenic acid (CLA), rosmarinic acid (RMA) and kaempferol (KAM); and 360 nm for myricetin (MYR), quercetin (QUE), luteolin (LUT) and apigenin (API).
