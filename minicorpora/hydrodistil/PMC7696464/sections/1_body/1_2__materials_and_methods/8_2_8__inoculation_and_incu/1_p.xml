<p>Petri plates were centrally inoculated by spotting 10 µL of a spore suspension (1.5 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> spores/mL) in the middle of the plate (one inoculum per plate). The control sample was inoculated by spotting 10 µL of sterile distilled water. The plates were sealed with parafilm and then incubated at 25 °C for 12 days. Antifungal activity was evaluated by calculating the area of mycelium growth [

A high-resolution photo of each petri dish was analyzed utilizing the eCognition Developer 9 software from Trimble (Trimble Germany GmbH, Munich, Germany).
