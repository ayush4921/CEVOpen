0: Petri plates were centrally inoculated by spotting 10 L of a spore suspension (1.5  10 3 spores/mL) in the middle of the plate (one inoculum per plate).
1: The control sample was inoculated by spotting 10 L of sterile distilled water.
2: The plates were sealed with parafilm and then incubated at 25 C for 12 days.
3: Antifungal activity was evaluated by calculating the area of mycelium growth [ 12].
4: The determination was performed for at least 12 biological replicates (petri dishes).
5: A high-resolution photo of each petri dish was analyzed utilizing the eCognition Developer 9 software from Trimble (Trimble Germany GmbH, Munich, Germany).
