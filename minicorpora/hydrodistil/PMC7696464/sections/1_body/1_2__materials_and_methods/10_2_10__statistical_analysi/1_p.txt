1: One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Duncans multiple range test was used to determine significant differences between the means of colony surface of PDA/bread samples on the same day of storage.
2: A general linear model was used to detect the general effect of the type of aromatic plant, level of addition, storage day and fungi species.
3: Significance for all tests was determined at a  p-value of 0.05, with statistical analyses performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows (Version 25.0, IBM Corp. Armonk, NY, USA).
