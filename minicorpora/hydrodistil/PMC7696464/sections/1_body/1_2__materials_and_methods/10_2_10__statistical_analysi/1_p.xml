<p>The determination of the effect of aromatic plants on the growth of 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> and 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> species was carried out in two replications. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Duncan’s multiple range test was used to determine significant differences between the means of colony surface of PDA/bread samples on the same day of storage. A general linear model was used to detect the general effect of the type of aromatic plant, level of addition, storage day and fungi species. Significance for all tests was determined at a 
 <italic>p</italic>-value of ≤0.05, with statistical analyses performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows (Version 25.0, IBM Corp. Armonk, NY, USA).
