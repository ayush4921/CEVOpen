<p>Bread slices were left in open air at room temperature to develop green mold. Fungal isolation from the overgrown colonies was carried out by touching the tip of the conidiophores and transferring them into sterilized water to dilute and inoculate PDA petri dishes for monoconidial isolation. Colonies belonging to the 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> genera were identified according to their macromorphological characteristics, transferred onto PDA, and incubated for 7 days at 25 ± 2 °C [

 <italic>Penicillium</italic> genera was conducted based on colony diameter, color, and texture, as well as by observing microscopic characteristics such as hyphae and conidiophore appearance, and the size and shape of vesicles, metulae, phialides, and conidia [
