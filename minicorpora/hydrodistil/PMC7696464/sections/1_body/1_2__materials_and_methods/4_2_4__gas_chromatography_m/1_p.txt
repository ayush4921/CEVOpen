0: The essential oils were analyzed by GC/MS as reported previously [ 23] in order to detect the potential relationship between chemical composition and biological activity as antifungal agents.
1: The analyses were performed by using a gas chromatograph 17A Ver.
2: 3 (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Inc., Kyoto, Japan) interfaced with a mass spectrometer Shimadzu QP-5050A, supported by the GC/MS Solution Ver.
3: 1.21 software.
4: The GC was equipped with a fused silica DB-5 capillary column (30 m  0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 m), and the optimal temperature program used was as follows: (a) 55120 C (3 C/min), 120200 C (4 C/min), 200220 C (6 C/min), and 220 C for 5 min; (b) from 60 to 240 C with temperature rate 3 C/min.
5: The injector temperature was maintained at 260 C; interface temperature 300 C, ion source heating 200 C, carrier gas helium (54.8 kPa); split ratio 1:30.
6: The volume injected was 1 L. Mass spectra were recorded at 70 eV.
7: The acquisition mass range was  m/ z 41450 at a scan time of 0.5 s.
