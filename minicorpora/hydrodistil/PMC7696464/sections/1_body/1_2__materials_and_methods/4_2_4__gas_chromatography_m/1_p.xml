<p>The essential oils were analyzed by GC/MS as reported previously [
 <xref rid="B23-foods-09-01642" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] in order to detect the potential relationship between chemical composition and biological activity as antifungal agents. The analyses were performed by using a gas chromatograph 17A Ver. 3 (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Inc., Kyoto, Japan) interfaced with a mass spectrometer Shimadzu QP-5050A, supported by the GC/MS Solution Ver. 1.21 software. The GC was equipped with a fused silica DB-5 capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 μm), and the optimal temperature program used was as follows: (a) 55–120 °C (3 °C/min), 120–200 °C (4 °C/min), 200–220 °C (6 °C/min), and 220 °C for 5 min; (b) from 60 to 240 °C with temperature rate 3 °C/min. The injector temperature was maintained at 260 °C; interface temperature 300 °C, ion source heating 200 °C, carrier gas helium (54.8 kPa); split ratio 1:30. The volume injected was 1 μL. Mass spectra were recorded at 70 eV. The acquisition mass range was
