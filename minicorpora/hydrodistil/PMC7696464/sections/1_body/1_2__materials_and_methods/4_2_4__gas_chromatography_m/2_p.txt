0: The identification of the constituents was based on comparisons of the retention time with those of authentic samples, comparing their linear indices relative to a series of n-alkanes (C7C22).
1: Further identifications were also made using a library of mass spectra built up from pure substances and components of known oils, and MS literature data (National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Gaithersburg, MD, USA) [ 24].
2: The percentage of each component identified was determined as the average of two replicates.
