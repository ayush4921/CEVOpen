0: The five varieties used in this study were selected out of fourteen varieties according to three criteria: high yield but low curcuminoid content (varieties, CL5, CL3), low yield but high curcumin content (CL10), and high yield and high curcumin content, thus, high curcumin yield (CL9, CL11), based on studies at Auburn University and Alabama A&M University.
1: Thus, CL3 and CL5 may be considered for the fresh rhizome market, CL 10 for the high curcumin dry rhizome herbal products market, and CL9 and CL11, which have attractive, orange-colored rhizomes, could serve both fresh and dry herbal produce markets.
2: The two varieties CL3 and CL9 were consistent in their performance over three years in both south and north Alabama.
3: A knowledge of their relative oil yield and composition could help in value-addition for either fresh rhizomes or dry herbal markets.
