0: Agglomerative hierarchical cluster (AHC) analysis was carried out using the chemical compositions of the  C. longa rhizome essential oils.
1: The compositions were treated as operational taxonomic units, with the percentages of the 16 most abundant components (-turmerone,  ar-turmerone, -turmerone, -phellandrene, 1,8-cineole, -zingiberene, -sesquiphellandrene, terpinolene, (6 S,7 R)-bisabolone,  p-cymene, zingiberenol,  ar-curcumene, -bisabolene, 7- epi-trans-sesquisabinene hydrate, limonene, and  ar-tumerol), using XLSTAT Premium, version 2018.1.1.62926.
2: Euclidean distance was used to determine dissimilarity, and Wards method was used to define the clusters.
