  <p>Green process assessment according to green extraction. Principle 1: Innovation by selection of varieties and use of renewable plant resources. Principle 2: Use of alternative solvents and principally water or agro-solvents. Principle 3: Reduce energy consumption by energy recovery and using innovative technologies. Principle 4: Production of co-products instead of waste to include the bio- and agro-refining industry. Principle 5: Reduce unit operations and favor safe, robust, and controlled processes. Principle 6: Aim for a non-denatured and biodegradable extract without contaminants.</p>
