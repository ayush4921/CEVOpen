<p>Essential oil composition was determined by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) using an electronic impact (70 eV) ionisation mode. Analysis was performed on a Hewlett-Packard 6890 coupled to a 5973A mass spectrometer, using HP5MS (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 µm film thickness). GC-MS spectra were obtained using the following conditions: the vector gas was helium, the flow rate for the HP-5MS column was 0.3 mL/min, split-less mode, injection volume, 1 μL; injection temperature, 250 °C; oven temperature program, 60 °C for 8 min then increased at 2 °C/min to 250 °C and held at 250 °C for 15 min. Identification of the components was based on computer matching against commercial libraries (Wiley, MassFinder 2.1 Library, and NIST98), laboratory mass spectra libraries built up from pure substances, and MS literature data combined with the comparison of GC retention indices (RI) on apolar and polar column. RI values were calculated with the help of a series of linear alkanes C
 <sub>6</sub>–C
 <sub>26</sub> on an HP5MS column). Compounds available in the laboratory were confirmed by external standard compound co-injection. Each sample was analyzed three times, and the RI was calculated as the average of the three experiments.
