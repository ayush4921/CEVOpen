<p>Hydrodistillation was performed using the same reactor type (REUS, Grasse, France) without the use of the adjusted arm (rotor and mixer). All extractions were performed using 5 L of distilled water and the same amount of material (Chinese star anise 200 g, Brazillian red pepper 400 g, cinnamon 300 g). The heat source was set up for the solvent to reach 100 °C. The kinetic was calculated as the first drop of distillate was seen, and extraction was conducted until no more oil was extracted. The essential oil was dried over magnesium sulphate and stored at 4 °C until used.</p>
