0: In order to obtain the maximal extraction, TC parameters need to be set to respect two main characteristics.
1: The first characteristic is to grind the agglomerates and biggest chunks of hard matter in order to maximize the contact area for water to penetrate the solid phase.
2: The second parameter is to keep a steady turbulent flow inside the reactor to maximize the evaporation area.
3: The apparatus used in this study is a scaled-down version of industrial turbodistillation reactor ( Figure 3A).
4: The vessel (1) ( Figure 3Ba) is a classic Alambic reactor (REUS, Grasse, France) and can contain up to 5 L of water and hard matrix (200 to 500 g).
5: We added the adjusted arm that is comprised of a rotor (2) and a reproduction of a turbo shredder (3).
6: The rotor speed is controlled and has to be adjusted so that flow and mixing are adequate for the protocol (turbulent flow and grinding of material).
7: The vessel is heated and temperature is controlled with a thermometer (4).
8: Evaporation under atmospheric pressure occurs at 100 C, and the vapors charged in essential oils flow through the distillation column (5), enrich the concentration of essential oil, and flow further into the condenser (6) where both the water and essential oil are condensed and drop into the Clevenger apparatus.
