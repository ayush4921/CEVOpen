<p>The essential oils of three spices, Chinese star Anise, Brazilian pepper, and cinnamon, obtained with a turbo-clevenger apparatus were compared against conventional laboratory-scaled hydrodistillation. Although there were no major changes in chemical composition, improvements are reported here regarding the effectiveness of this apparatus. It allows the obtaining of essential oils in similar quantities/yields or even higher. The extraction time was divided by at least three compared to the conventional hydrodistillation process. The energy consumption was consequently dramatically reduced as well. The apparatus can then be used in laboratory to measure kinetics of extraction and to produce small quantities of quality essential oils that can be analyzed immediately. </p>
