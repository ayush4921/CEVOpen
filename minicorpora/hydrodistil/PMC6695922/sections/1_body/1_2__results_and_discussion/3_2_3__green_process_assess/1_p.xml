<p>Existing extraction technologies are linked to several technological, environmental, and scientific barriers that are generally complex and difficult to overcome, for instance, minimizing energy and toxic solvent consumption, all the while reducing CO
 <sub>2</sub> emission and guaranteeing safety and control for both the final product and the technical staff involved. Both the turbo-Clevenger and hydrodistillation processes were evaluated according to the six principles of green extraction that were developed by Chemat et al. [

Those principles allow the design of extraction methods that aim to grant a natural and safe extract from well-reasoned sourcing with, instead of waste, a high added value, while reducing the organic solvents, the energy consumption, as well as the process time (
