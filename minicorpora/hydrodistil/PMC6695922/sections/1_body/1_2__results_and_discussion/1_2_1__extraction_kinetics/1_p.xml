<p>Patent describes an industrial scale reactor that can contain 800 L of water and approximately 300 kg of dry matter to produce a mass of essential oil ranging few kilograms (40 to 60 kg) over 4 h. Our laboratory-scale TC permitted the extraction of 500 g of dry matter with 2 L of water over 2 h of extraction to produce a few grams of essential oil. The yield is defined as the percentage of weight of essential oil extracted from the initial mass. While reporting the Chinese star anise essential oil extracted volume against the extraction time (
