The first step from minute 0 to minute 15 for the TC with a very rapid extraction speed, which corresponds to the immediately accessible essential oil, easily transferred to the solvent. This phase occurs from minute 0 to minute 60 in the case of HD. From minute 15 to minute 45 in the TC protocol, a slower steady extraction phenomenon is observed. During this phase, the solvent must penetrate the matter’s hard structure before reaching the essential oil. This phase ranges from minute 60 to minute 300 for HD. Finally, the last phase from minute 45 to the end of the extraction (TC) and from minute 300 to minute 450 (HD) is the plateau that marks the end of the extraction process. The matter has almost been depleted in essential oil. Past 120 min for TC, no further essential oil could be obtained from the matter. This profile is typical to all essential oil extractions [

Although the extracted quantity differed from one species to the next, the kinetic profiles were similar for all three spices (data not shown). The main advantage of the TC, in regards to the kinetic of extraction, is that the essential oils were obtained in a dramatically reduced time. We observe here that TC permits us to divide by at least three the extraction time of hard matrices’ essential oils. Whatever the process, yields were at least similar for cinnamon (1.37%) and red pepper (2.22%) essential oils and in accordance with the yield range reported in literature [

 <xref rid="B14-molecules-24-02734" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], but the extraction time was reduced by a factor of three. In the case of Chinese star anise, the yield was improved by a factor of two in 120 min for TC vs HD. The maximum of the yield for HD was obtained in 360 min. The second phase of the extraction kinetic profile is particularly reduced (from 240 min for HD down to 30 min for TC), allowing the final plateau and maximum yield to be obtained very quickly. Turbo-distillation make three actions: detexturing the matrix, allowing better accessibility to glands of essential oil, and at the same time enhancing turbulence for better extraction and enhancement of surface evaporation.
