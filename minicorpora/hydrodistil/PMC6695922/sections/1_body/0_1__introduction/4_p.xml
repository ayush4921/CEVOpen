<p>Generally, the authors have reported full studies of processes from laboratory to pilot scale and not the other way around [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-24-02734" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Filly et al. [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-24-02734" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] have proposed a green method for the extraction of essential oil from aromatic herbs without any added solvent or water. This technique, solvent-free microwave extraction (SFME) is a combination of microwave heating and dry distillation. Experiments performed in a 75 L pilot microwave reactor prove the feasibility of SFME upscaling and potential industrial applications.
