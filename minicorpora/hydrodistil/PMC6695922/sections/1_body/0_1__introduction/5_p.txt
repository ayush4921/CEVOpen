0: Downscaling chemistry processes is a growing area of research.
1: Current trends in green analytical chemistry [ 7, 8] involve the development of downscaled instrumentation [ 9] due to an increase in demand for rapid, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly sample preparation methods prior to analysis: significant shortening of processes with subsequent savings in energy, natural state of the extracts is intact, and minimization of wastes.
2: These past years, there has been a development of downscale sample preparation apparatus that can help to do the in-field extraction, sample preparation, analysis, and data evaluation.
3: In parallel, a portable instrument is defined as easily movable, convenient for carrying, and capable of being transferred or adapted in altered circumstances.
4: Downscaling or miniaturization of a procedure can be achieved simply by reducing the dimensions of the systems used in earlier approaches or by developing completely new set-ups or techniques.
5: When compared to conventional systems, miniature systems can perform similar methods with remarkably reduced consumption of plant matrix and solvents, size and power requirements, system costs, with a faster analysis time and massively parallel analysis capability.
6: It is an attractive method for applications requiring in-field rapid assays.
