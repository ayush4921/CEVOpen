<p>Turbodistillation was patented by Martel in 1983 [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-24-02734" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and has been used in several companies (Grasse-France) as an industrial purpose (1000 L to 10 000 L) for the extraction of essential oils from hard matrixes (such as wood, bark, and seeds). The extraction process is the same as hydrodistillation (HD), but a mechanical stirrer breaks down agglomerates and chunks of hard matrices and homogenizes the medium at the same time. It reduces extraction time and energy consumption and allows preventing the degradation of volatile compounds compared to HD.
