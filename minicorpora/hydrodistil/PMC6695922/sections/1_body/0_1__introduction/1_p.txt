0: In general, an analytical procedure for essential oils from herbs or spices comprises two steps: extraction (steam distillation, hydrodistillation) and analysis (gas chromatography (GC), gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS)).
1: Whereas the last step is finished after only 15 to 30 min, extraction takes at least several hours.
2: It is frequently done by prolonged heating and stirring in boiling water using a Clevenger apparatus for hours or days.
3: These shortcomings have led to the consideration of the use of innovative techniques in essential oil extraction that typically use less water and energy, such as ultrasound and microwave [ 1, 2].
