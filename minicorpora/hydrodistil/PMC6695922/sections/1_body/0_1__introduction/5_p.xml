<p>Downscaling chemistry processes is a growing area of research. Current trends in green analytical chemistry [

 <xref rid="B9-molecules-24-02734" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] due to an increase in demand for rapid, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly sample preparation methods prior to analysis: significant shortening of processes with subsequent savings in energy, natural state of the extracts is intact, and minimization of wastes. These past years, there has been a development of downscale sample preparation apparatus that can help to do the in-field extraction, sample preparation, analysis, and data evaluation. In parallel, a portable instrument is defined as “easily” movable, convenient for carrying, and capable of being transferred or adapted in altered circumstances. Downscaling or miniaturization of a procedure can be achieved simply by reducing the dimensions of the systems used in earlier approaches or by developing completely new set-ups or techniques. When compared to conventional systems, miniature systems can perform similar methods with remarkably reduced consumption of plant matrix and solvents, size and power requirements, system costs, with a faster analysis time and massively parallel analysis capability. It is an attractive method for applications requiring in-field rapid assays.
