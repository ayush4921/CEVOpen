<p>In general, an analytical procedure for essential oils from herbs or spices comprises two steps: extraction (steam distillation, hydrodistillation) and analysis (gas chromatography (GC), gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS)). Whereas the last step is finished after only 15 to 30 min, extraction takes at least several hours. It is frequently done by prolonged heating and stirring in boiling water using a Clevenger apparatus for hours or days. These shortcomings have led to the consideration of the use of innovative techniques in essential oil extraction that typically use less water and energy, such as ultrasound and microwave [
