0: Turbodistillation was patented by Martel in 1983 [ 3] and has been used in several companies (Grasse-France) as an industrial purpose (1000 L to 10 000 L) for the extraction of essential oils from hard matrixes (such as wood, bark, and seeds).
1: The extraction process is the same as hydrodistillation (HD), but a mechanical stirrer breaks down agglomerates and chunks of hard matrices and homogenizes the medium at the same time.
2: It reduces extraction time and energy consumption and allows preventing the degradation of volatile compounds compared to HD.
