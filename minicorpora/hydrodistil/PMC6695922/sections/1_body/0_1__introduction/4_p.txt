2: [ 6] have proposed a green method for the extraction of essential oil from aromatic herbs without any added solvent or water.
3: This technique, solvent-free microwave extraction (SFME) is a combination of microwave heating and dry distillation.
4: Experiments performed in a 75 L pilot microwave reactor prove the feasibility of SFME upscaling and potential industrial applications.
