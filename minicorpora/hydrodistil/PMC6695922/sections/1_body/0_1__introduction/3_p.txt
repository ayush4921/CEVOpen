0: Turbodistillation resolves the problem of hard structure, encountered with spice matrices, which makes HD less effective as water has to penetrate a thick physical barrier in order to reach the secretory stores deep inside the structure.
1: Dry milling of hard matrices has been performed, but this extra unit operation generates thermal degradation of the essential oil.
2: Moreover, without stirring, the powdered matrix lies still at the bottom of the reactor, where it can burn, resulting in a degraded essential oil.
3: However, turbodistillation is not a good extraction alternative for soft matrices.
4: Perino-Issartier et al.
5: [ 4] have compared different extraction processes such as ultrasound, microwave, turbodistillation, steam, and hydrodistillation to obtain essential oils from lavandin.
6: The essential oils are all similar in terms of yields and aromatic profiles and the odor is similar to the original lavender.
