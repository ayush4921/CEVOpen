 <p>In the effort of innovation towards green analytical chemistry concepts and considering the six principles of green extraction, the industrial turbodistillation process was downscaled into a laboratory apparatus turbo-Clevenger (TC) for the extraction of essential oils. Turbodistillation is used as an industrial purpose for the extraction of essential oils from hard matrixes such as wood, barks, seeds. In this work, a TC and the conventional technique of hydrodistillation (HD, Clevenger apparatus) are used for the extraction of essential oils from three spices with hard structures (
  <italic>Illicium verum</italic>, 
  <italic>Schinus terebinthifolius,</italic> and 
  <italic>Cinnamomum cassia</italic>) and are compared. This study shows that the essential oils extracted by TC in 30 min were quantitatively (yield and kinetics profile) and qualitatively (aromatic profile) similar to those obtained using conventional hydrodistillation in 3 h. This process, which gave a reduced extraction time, was perfectly adapted to the extraction of hard matrixes.
