<p id="Par31">Reproductive behavioral compensation mechanisms have been reported in the butterfly

Males that experienced diet with low nutritional quality during larval development could not monopolize an energetically costly territory similar to well-provided males. However, they compensated this weakness with a patrolling tactic to maximize reproductive success
