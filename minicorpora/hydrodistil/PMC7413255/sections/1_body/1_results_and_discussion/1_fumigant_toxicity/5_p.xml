<p id="Par13">Some studies have documented that sublethal exposure to plant essential oils, or environmental changes (e.g., host changes) could impact the fitness of stored product insect pests. For example, clove and cinnamon essential oils have reported as toxic as the pyrethroid-based insecticide deltamethrin against 
 <italic>C. maculatus</italic> and severely decreased adult emergence and egg number

 <italic>Acanthoscelides obtectus</italic>, and reproductive performance has been evaluated after exposure to clove and cinnamon essential oils. The results indicated that clove essential oil was more effective when insects were reared on cranberry bean masses and caused higher mortality
