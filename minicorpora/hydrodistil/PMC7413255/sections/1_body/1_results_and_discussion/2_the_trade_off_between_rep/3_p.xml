<p id="Par18">Embryo short time exposure to the essential oils influenced female adult longevity (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d). The longevity was 10.8 days for control females and 8.0 and 8.1 days for leaf and flower essential oil-treated females, respectively. Treated and untreated adult males had statistically the same longevity. Male longevity was shorter than that of females (Fig.
