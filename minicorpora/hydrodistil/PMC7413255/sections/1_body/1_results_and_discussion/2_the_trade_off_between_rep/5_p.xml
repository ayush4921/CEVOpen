<p id="Par20">A trade-off occurs when an improvement in one life-history trait (improving fitness) is combined with a decrease in another life-history feature (reducing fitness). So that the fitness value is balanced against fitness costs by increasing one trait by decreasing another trait. Trade-offs are typically defined by negative genetic or phenotypic correlations between individual fitness components within a population
