<p id="Par19">It is worth noting that F0 embryo exposure to flower essential oil significantly reduced F1 egg number (10 ± 0.7) compared to control (15 ± 1.1) and leaf essential oil (14.4 ± 0.7) group (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). Therefore, there was a fitness consequence of essential oil stress by a trade-off between reproduction and female longevity in leaf essential oil-treated embryo. Thus, the improvement in reproduction was costly in terms of longevity decrease to avoid further reduction of egg numbers.
