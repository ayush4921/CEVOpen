0: Based on the bioassay, the embryo exposure to the concentration of 75.7 l/l air caused almost 50% of hatching in both essential oils (Supplementary Fig.
1: 2).
2: Therefore, 150 eggs were fumigated with leaf essential oil and 150 eggs with flower essential oil for 24 h. Also, 75 eggs that achieved no treatment considered as control.
3: Treated eggs were placed in Petri dishes individually.
4: Total numbers of eggs hatched were counted after 7 days.
5: The daily observation was done, and F0 larval duration, adult emergence, and longevity were monitored every day.
6: Since adults emerged, males and females were paired and checked daily to record their survival and the numbers of laid eggs.
7: The experiments continued until all of the individuals died.
8: Insects were allowed to oviposit 24 h to obtain the F1 egg number and hatch.
9: Then seeds with eggs were transferred to a separate Petri dish.
10: The experiment was repeated three times, and F1 adult emergence and longevity were recorded daily.
11: Egg number and hatch rate were documented for F2 generation, too.
