<p id="Par42">Based on the bioassay, the embryo exposure to the concentration of 75.7 µl/l
 <sub>air</sub> caused almost 50% of hatching in both essential oils (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Therefore, 150 eggs were fumigated with leaf essential oil and 150 eggs with flower essential oil for 24 h. Also, 75 eggs that achieved no treatment considered as control. Treated eggs were placed in Petri dishes individually. Total numbers of eggs hatched were counted after 7 days. The daily observation was done, and F0 larval duration, adult emergence, and longevity were monitored every day. Since adults emerged, males and females were paired and checked daily to record their survival and the numbers of laid eggs. The experiments continued until all of the individuals died. Insects were allowed to oviposit 24 h to obtain the F1 egg number and hatch. Then seeds with eggs were transferred to a separate Petri dish. The experiment was repeated three times, and F1 adult emergence and longevity were recorded daily. Egg number and hatch rate were documented for F2 generation, too.
