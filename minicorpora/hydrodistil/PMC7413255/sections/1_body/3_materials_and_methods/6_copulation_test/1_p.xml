<p id="Par43">We collected virgin males and females by removing adults as they emerged. We used 120 newly emerged (&lt; 24 h-old) virgin adults to do copulation test. The male was placed in a Petri dish, and then immediately, a female was transferred. Pairs were given 5 min to mate. The pair's behavioral changes were monitored, and mating latency, the start of copulation, the start of a male kicking by female, and termination of copulation were recorded. If a male does nothing during this time, it was recorded as male without tendency. If a male tried to start copulation and female actively rejected males and prevent copulation, it was recorded as male rejection.</p>
