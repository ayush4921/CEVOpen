<p id="Par36">In conclusion, our study demonstrates that 
 <italic>C. maculatus</italic> embryo, after exposure to an environmental stressor like essential oils, struggles to compensate deleterious effects even by changing reproductive behavior to increase fitness and guarantee progeny production or trade-off between longevity and fecundity. Epigenetic is the mechanism that can transfer gene expression alteration template during different life stages and even to the later generations. It can be an evolutionary mechanism to save the species from possible extinction in deleterious environmental situations.
