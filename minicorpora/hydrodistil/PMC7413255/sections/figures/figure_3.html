 <caption> Effect of eucalyptus leaf and flower essential oils (EO) on different biology parameters of C. maculatus F0 generation. ( a) F0 egg hatch (%); ( b) F0 larval duration (day); ( c) F0 adult emergence (%); ( d) F0 adult longevity (day). Essential oils did not influence F0 larval duration and adult longevity. However, decreased F0 egg hatch (%) and adult emergence. Different letters indicate significant differences between the treatments ( P &lt; 0.05). </caption>
