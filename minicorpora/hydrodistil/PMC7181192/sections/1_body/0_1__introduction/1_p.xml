<p>The occurrence of dementia and neurodegenerative diseases (like Alzheimerâ€™s disease) is increasing, especially among the older population. It is estimated, that by 2050 ca. 115.4 million people will be affected by the progression of the disease. This fact has a significant impact on the budget of healthcare and social care around the world, especially because there is no effective drug against the development of cognitive disorders. The currently available medications can slow down the progression of dementia, but not to treat it. Based on the above information, the search for new potential drug candidates that retard the progression of memory impairment is of the highest importance [

Among the mechanisms of dementia are disturbances in acetylcholine synthesis and an overproduction of esterases, that decompose this neuromodulator, have been highlighted in various scientific reports. Acetylcholine has a crucial role in the supporting neuronal signal transmission, which helps to remember and recall events and things. Cognitive dysfunctions are observed, when acetylcholine is excessively decomposed by the active esterases. Therefore, the inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) are carefully studied, as they sustain the signal transmission between the neuronal synapses and limit the occurrence of etiological factors for dementia [
