0: The occurrence of dementia and neurodegenerative diseases (like Alzheimers disease) is increasing, especially among the older population.
1: It is estimated, that by 2050 ca.
2: 115.4 million people will be affected by the progression of the disease.
3: This fact has a significant impact on the budget of healthcare and social care around the world, especially because there is no effective drug against the development of cognitive disorders.
4: The currently available medications can slow down the progression of dementia, but not to treat it.
5: Based on the above information, the search for new potential drug candidates that retard the progression of memory impairment is of the highest importance [ 1, 2].
6: Among the mechanisms of dementia are disturbances in acetylcholine synthesis and an overproduction of esterases, that decompose this neuromodulator, have been highlighted in various scientific reports.
7: Acetylcholine has a crucial role in the supporting neuronal signal transmission, which helps to remember and recall events and things.
8: Cognitive dysfunctions are observed, when acetylcholine is excessively decomposed by the active esterases.
9: Therefore, the inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) are carefully studied, as they sustain the signal transmission between the neuronal synapses and limit the occurrence of etiological factors for dementia [ 3].
