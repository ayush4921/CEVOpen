<p>According to Tung and co-investigators, [

 <italic>Zingiber officinale</italic>. Also, the manuscript by Fathy and colleagues described weak activity of phenolic constituents of ginger extracts and a moderate potential of ginger essential oil [

In the light of these findings the TLC-based bioautography screening was performed on the unpolar extracts from ginger rhizomes to identify the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors among terpens that are present in a rich mixture of secondary metabolites that are produced by ginger. The determination of their potency in comparison with galantamine—a phenanthrene alkaloid commonly administered in Alzheimer’s disease—was also achieved.
