<p>Surprisingly, despite the huge popularity of 
 <italic>Zingiber officinale,</italic> with several studies on its application in pharmacology, healthcare, and dietetics, the data on the nervous system targeting activity of single molecules from its extracts are still insufficient. Previous studies have mentioned a marked potential of ginger extracts or fractions as AChE inhibitors. The performed tests in most of the cases use an in vitro AChE inhibition assay (Ellmann’s method), that allows the calculation of the IC50 value of the tested samples in relation to other reference compounds (e.g., galanthamine or berberine) with confirmed AChE inhibitory properties. However, the activity determined in the Ellmann’s test concerns the entire tested sample. So, based on its results, it is impossible to identify the activity of single components present in the tested mixture of compounds, that are responsible for the studied properties [
