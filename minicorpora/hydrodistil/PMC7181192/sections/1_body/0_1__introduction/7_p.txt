0: Another goal of this study was to collect the qualitative and quantitative results from the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses, that will help to select the most optimal extraction conditions and obtain enriched extracts with an increased concentration of active metabolites.
1: In the presented work the unipolar ginger extracts will be obtained by hydrodistillation (HD), pressurized liquid extraction or accelerated solvent extraction (ASE), shaking maceration (SM), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), and ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE).
2: The obtained samples will be evaluated by GC-MS analyses to provide a clear view of the efficiency of all extraction techniques and extraction conditions.
