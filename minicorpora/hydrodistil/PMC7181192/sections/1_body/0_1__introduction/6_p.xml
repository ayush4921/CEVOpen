<p>The results of the in vitro AChE inhibition studies performed by other authors have been confirmed by several in vivo assays, that determine the actual activity of ginger extracts or fractions in living organisms. Sutalangka and Wattanathorn [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-25-01643" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] observed in their study on rats that after an oral administration of 
 <italic>Zingiber officinale</italic> and 
 <italic>Cyperus rotundus</italic> extracts the cognition and memorizing processes were elevated and AChE activity decreased. These extracts were found to affect the cholinergic functions of brain and decrease neurodegeneration and oxidative stress.
