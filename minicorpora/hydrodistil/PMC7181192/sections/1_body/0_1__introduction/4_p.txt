0: According to Tung and co-investigators, [ 8] the highest AChE-inhibitory activity was calculated for the ethyl acetate fraction obtained from a crude extract of  Zingiber officinale.
1: Also, the manuscript by Fathy and colleagues described weak activity of phenolic constituents of ginger extracts and a moderate potential of ginger essential oil [ 9].
2: Based on these results, the authors found it interesting to study less polar constituents of ginger extracts.
3: In the light of these findings the TLC-based bioautography screening was performed on the unpolar extracts from ginger rhizomes to identify the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors among terpens that are present in a rich mixture of secondary metabolites that are produced by ginger.
4: The determination of their potency in comparison with galantaminea phenanthrene alkaloid commonly administered in Alzheimers diseasewas also achieved.
