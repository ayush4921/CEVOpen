<p>The TLC-bioautography technique that has been used in the survey to identify the potentially active AChE inhibitors from the ginger rhizomes has been found effective enough to fish out the drug candidates and, coupled with TLC-HPLC-MS approach, to identify the active metabolites with no need for their isolation from the mixture. The optimization of extraction, that has been performed for the sake of a better recovery of the identified three active components: 
 <italic>ar</italic>-curcumene, α-sesquiphellandrene, and α-zingiberene showed the best efficiency of the HD, SFE and SM 10.
