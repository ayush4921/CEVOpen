<p>Contrary to the findings of Verma and colleagues [

 <italic>Zingiber montanum</italic> does not exhibit any AChE activity, in our study on 
 <italic>Zingiber officinale</italic>, it was found that regions of the TLC plate (the middle third and the lower third) that contain the phenolic compounds and unpolar metabolites (the upper third) contained several active zones (

 <xref rid="B15-molecules-25-01643" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] showed a positive physiological effect of both groups of metabolites, which were administered orally to animals in the form of an essential oil or ginger rhizomes extract at the quantity of 100 mg/kg b.w. In the same survey the Alzheimerâ€™s disease was induced in the tested animals through aluminum chloride. Subsequent biochemical tests showed an inhibition of AChE, a decreased inflammation, and an improvement in the morphological structure of brains. Based on these findings, the herein described results are in line with the expectations.
