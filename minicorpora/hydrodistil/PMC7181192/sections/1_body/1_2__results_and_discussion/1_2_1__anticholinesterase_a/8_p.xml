<p>Further results on the optimization of extraction, presented below, showed that α-zingiberene was present in much smaller quantity than the other two compounds. The SFE extract contained three times less α-sesquiphellandrene or 
 <italic>ar-</italic>curcumene than α-zingiberene in the extract. Based on these calculations the latter compound shows the weakest inhibitory potential among the three metabolites.
