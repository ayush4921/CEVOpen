<p>The AChE inhibitory assay used in the study was elaborated by Mroczek and colleagues [

In the process of derivatization Fast Blue B salt forms a purple diazonium dye with the acetic acid coming from the decomposition of substrate by the enzyme. In the presence of an active metabolite on a TLC plate, which is bound with the enzyme, no acetic acid production occurs and no colored background is visible. As a result, active inhibitors of AChE are visible on the TLC plate in the form of colorless or yellowish spots against a purple background [

According to di Giovanni and collaborators, some divergence related to the identification of enzyme inhibitor may occur between the TLC bioautographic and spectrophotometric methods. However, according to the authors, the positive results of the TLC assay were confirmed by the spectrophotometric studies in the vast majority of cases, which cannot be said of the opposite [
