<p>The calibration curve, that was obtained for galantamine in the same conditions of TLC bioautography assay, that was performed for the total extract from ginger rhizomes, helped to present the potency of the three terpenes, measured in galantamine equivalents. For the extract concentration of 2 mg/mL and the injection of 10 µL of the extract on the TLC plate the following values were obtained: for 
 <italic>ar-</italic>curcumene: 0.24, for α-sesquiphellandrene: 0.28, and for α-zingiberene: 0.21 galantamine equivalents [ng]. The calibration curve equation of galantamine was equal to y = 1541.5x + 6240.5, and the
