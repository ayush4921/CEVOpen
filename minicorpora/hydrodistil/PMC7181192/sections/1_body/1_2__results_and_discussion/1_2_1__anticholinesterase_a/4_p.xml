<p>The identity of the three active zones (A, B, and C) present in the upper part of the TLC plate (terpene’s region,

The volatile constituents were present in the documented mass spectra even when operating in the HPLC system, which means that they were successfully eluted out of the TLC-MS interface and a short chromatographic column by the mixture of water: acetonitrile (20:80
