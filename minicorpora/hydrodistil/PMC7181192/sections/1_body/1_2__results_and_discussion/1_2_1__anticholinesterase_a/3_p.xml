<p>To accurately identify the metabolites present in the discolored zones, two TLC plates were developed at the same time in different TLC chambers, using the very same mobile phaseâ€”one with an addition of 2-naphthyl acetate, that was further sprayed with the enzyme and derivatized with Fast Blue B solution, and the other one without an addition of 2-naphthyl-acetate or any other reagents in the mobile phase. Both TLC plates were later compared with each other under the UV lamp (Camag, Muttenz, Switzerland) at two wavelengths (254 and 366 nm), and the same spots were marked across each track. A designed, unsprayed TLC plate was later subjected to TLC-HPLC-MS analysis. This technique uses a moving head, which is capable of collecting the silica gel from the TLC plate from the indicated spot and washing out the compounds present in the indicated place with the help of a mobile phase, which is used in the HPLC-MS analysis. In our study, we attached a short chromatographic column right after the TLC-MS interface, to segregate any eventually present metabolite mixtures from one another and to assess the purity of the collected spot in a better manner. The eluted components were later directed to the mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization ion source and the identity was checked using a Qualitative Navigator of the MassHunter Workstation Program (see
