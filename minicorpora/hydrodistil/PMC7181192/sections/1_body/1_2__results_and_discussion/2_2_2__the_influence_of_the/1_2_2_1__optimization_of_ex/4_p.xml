<p>The application of the SFE extraction that uses CO
 <sub>2</sub> in its supercritical state, which occurs under the precisely set temperature and pressure conditions, can produce high-quality extracts according to the rules of green chemistry, as CO
 <sub>2</sub> turns to gas owing to the atmospheric pressure. Due to high loading capacities, low critical temperature, and pressure values, the SFE is especially used for extracting unipolar constituents from the plant matrix [
