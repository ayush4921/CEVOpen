<p>Owing to numerous limitations of conventional methods, some alternative techniques of extraction of volatiles were applied in this study, in the hope that they could drastically reduce the consumption of solvents and the extraction time, and at the same time increase the efficiency of the recovery process and provide the final samples that would be more rich in the three identified active molecules:
