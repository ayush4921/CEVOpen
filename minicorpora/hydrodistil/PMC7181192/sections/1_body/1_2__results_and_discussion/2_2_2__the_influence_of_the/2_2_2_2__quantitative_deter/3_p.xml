<p>Concerning the compounds of interest, the SFE extraction, followed by the HD, were the techniques that recovered the highest quantity of all three active molecules. However, the former technique was able to extract above three times more of each terpene in comparison with the HD. A-Zingiberene was the most abundant among the components (

 <italic>ar</italic>-curcumene and 0.77 ± 0.045 of α-sesquiphellandrene from the extract. An increase in the applied operating pressure elevated the content of the studied compounds, but not significantly, as it has been expected based on the previous results [

In case of the three selected components of the rhizomes, the ultrasonic extraction was the most efficient, when performed shortly. Longer extraction time (10 or 15 min) decreased the content of the volatiles, and a three-cycle extraction run provided the weakest recoveries. Also, an elevated temperature had an impact on the content of terpenes in UAE. The higher the temperature applied, the lower the content of terpenes. This conclusion stays in accordance with the previously published data [
