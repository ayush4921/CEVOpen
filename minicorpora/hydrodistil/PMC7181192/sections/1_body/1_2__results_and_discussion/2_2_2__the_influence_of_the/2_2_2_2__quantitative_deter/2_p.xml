<p>Concerning sesquiterpenes, which have been found to be the most active in the AChE TLC-based bioautography assay, we noted that the most effective technique that provided the highest recovery of these metabolites was SFE. Both the applied conditions delivered ca. 5 times more of the active molecules than the HD, which has been perceived as the second most effective technique. This significant difference may be affected by a very high penetrability of carbon dioxide through the plant cells. SM applied for 10 min and UAE at 30 °C within 5, 10, or 15 min recovered almost half of what HD could be able to extract. It is worth noting that the UTP extraction for 5 min gave results comparable to those of the HD. Surprisingly, ASE in all tested temperature settings (40, 60, and 80 °C) was found to be inefficient, probably due to the decomposition of volatiles occurring during the extraction process. The ASE extracts produced at 40 °C did not contain any terpenes, whereas when higher temperatures were applied, their content was still very low (see
