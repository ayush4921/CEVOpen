<p>The results of the quantitative GC-MS analysis of ginger oleoresin after HD, ASE, UAE, SM, and SFE were obtained based on the calculated calibration curve equations of each reference compound (the obtained R
 <sup>2</sup> values were higher than 0.99 for each curve), and are presented in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-01643-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-01643">Table S1 (supplementary material file)</xref>. Classical hydrodistillation and SFE extraction were the only techniques from the tested ones that extracted simple terpene hydrocarbons, such as α- and β-pinene, myrcene, eucalyptol, camphene or others (see 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-01643">Table S1</xref>). The other performed extraction protocols were not efficient enough to recover this group of metabolites from the plant cells.
