<p>On the other hand, ASE required higher operation temperatures. The lowest values applied (40 °C) did not recover any terpenes from the matrix. Only some of them were present in the extracts prepared at 60 °C, whereas in the case of ASE80 samples a higher variety of terpenes was noted. Further increase in the temperature led again to a decreased content of majority of compounds. Based on these observations it could be concluded, that ASE extraction is not a preferable technique for the recovery of ginger terpenes.</p>
