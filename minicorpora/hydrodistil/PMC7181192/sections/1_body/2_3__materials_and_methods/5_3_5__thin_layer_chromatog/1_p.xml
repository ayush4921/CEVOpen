<p>A thin layer chromatography-high-performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (TLC-HPLC-ESI-TOF-MS) analysis was performed to assess the identity of the active constituents of the extracts using a mass spectrometer. The analysis was performed on plain TLC plates with zero derivatization. For this purpose, an Agilent G3250AA HPLC 1200 Series/6210 MSD TOF platform with a connected TLC-MS interface (Camag, Muttenz, Switzerland) and a short chromatographic column (Zorbax RP-18 Rapid Resolution 50 × 2.1 mm, d
 <sub>p</sub> = 5 µm, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA USA) were used in accordance with the previously published methodology [

The following settings of the mass spectrometer were applied: positive ionization mode, gas and vaporizer temperatures 350 °C, drying gas flow 10 L/min, nebulizer 30 psig, fragmentor voltage 175 V, skimmer voltage 65 V, and capillary voltage 2000 V. MassHunter Workstation program (version B.02.00) was used to handle the obtained data.
