0: A thin layer chromatography-high-performance liquid chromatographymass spectrometry (TLC-HPLC-ESI-TOF-MS) analysis was performed to assess the identity of the active constituents of the extracts using a mass spectrometer.
1: The analysis was performed on plain TLC plates with zero derivatization.
2: For this purpose, an Agilent G3250AA HPLC 1200 Series/6210 MSD TOF platform with a connected TLC-MS interface (Camag, Muttenz, Switzerland) and a short chromatographic column (Zorbax RP-18 Rapid Resolution 50  2.1 mm, d p = 5 m, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA USA) were used in accordance with the previously published methodology [ 12].
3: An isocratic run was selected on the HPLC chromatograph.
4: The mobile phase was composed of solvent A (water with 0.1% formic acid) and solvent B (acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid), that were pumped in the ratio of 20:80 ( v/ v).
5: The total analysis time was set at 5 min from the collection of the spots content by a TLC interface (Camag, Muttenz, Switzerland).
6: The application time was set at 3 s. The following settings of the mass spectrometer were applied: positive ionization mode, gas and vaporizer temperatures 350 C, drying gas flow 10 L/min, nebulizer 30 psig, fragmentor voltage 175 V, skimmer voltage 65 V, and capillary voltage 2000 V. MassHunter Workstation program (version B.02.00) was used to handle the obtained data.
