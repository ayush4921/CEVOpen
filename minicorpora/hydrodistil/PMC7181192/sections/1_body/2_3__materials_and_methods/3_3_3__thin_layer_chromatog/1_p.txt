0: All TLC chromatograms were obtained on aluminum-covered normal phase TLC plates (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany, silica gel 60 F254).
1: First, optimization studies on the composition of the mobile phase were performed to efficiently separate phenolic compounds from terpens on the thin layer.
2: Finally the mixture of methanol and dichloromethane (5:95  v/v) was selected as the most effective one based on the derivatization with 1% sulfuric acid and UV visualization.
