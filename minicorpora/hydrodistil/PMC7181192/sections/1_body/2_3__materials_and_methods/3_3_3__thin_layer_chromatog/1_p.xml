<p>All TLC chromatograms were obtained on aluminum-covered normal phase TLC plates (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany, silica gel 60 F254). First, optimization studies on the composition of the mobile phase were performed to efficiently separate phenolic compounds from terpens on the thin layer. Finally the mixture of methanol and dichloromethane (5:95
