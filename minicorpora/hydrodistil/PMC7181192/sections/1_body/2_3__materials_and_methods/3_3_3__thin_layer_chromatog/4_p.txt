0: The TLC plates were developed in the mobile phase composed of 5% of MeOH in DCM, with an addition of 2-naphthyl acetate (30 mg for 20 mL of the mobile phase).
1: The TLC plates of the extract and galantamine standard, which were prepared in triplicate, were evaporated to dryness and derivatized with a solution of AChE (3 units/mL) in Tris buffer (pH of 7.8), that was stabilized with bovine serum.
2: The sprayed TLC plates were incubated for 20 min at 37 C in high humidity conditions and after air-drying, they were visualized with a Fast Blue B salt solution (0.615 mg/mL).
3: Separately, similar TLC plates were prepared without the derivatization, to be analyzed by TLC-LC-MS spectrometry for the identification purposes, as described in the  Section 3.5.
