<p>Several concentrations of the same extract ginger equal to 40, 20, 10, 5, 2.5, and 1.25 µg of the extract per spot were introduced using a Hamilton syringe on every TLC plate. Also, the solution of galantamine—a phenanthrene alkaloid of natural origin that is commonly administered in Alzheimer’s patients —was prepared and different volumes were spotted on a clean TLC plate to enable the calculation of galantamine calibration curve, namely: 27, 18, 9, 4.5, 2, and 0.25 ng of galantamine per spot (see
