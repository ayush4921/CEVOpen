<p>A revised test for the determination of AChE inhibitory properties authored by Mroczek [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-25-01643" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] was implemented in this study on diethyl ether extracts from fresh finely cut ginger rhizome and on the galantamine solution containing plate. The total extract was obtained from the ginger rhizomes that, finely cut, were transferred to a mortar and mixed vigorously with diethyl ether using a pistel. The obtained extract was filtered through a glass Pasteur pipette filled with silica gel to remove the water. Then, it was air-dried and used for the bioactivity studies.
