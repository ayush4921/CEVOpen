<p>The TLC plates were developed in the mobile phase composed of 5% of MeOH in DCM, with an addition of 2-naphthyl acetate (30 mg for 20 mL of the mobile phase). The TLC plates of the extract and galantamine standard, which were prepared in triplicate, were evaporated to dryness and derivatized with a solution of AChE (3 units/mL) in Tris buffer (pH of 7.8), that was stabilized with bovine serum. The sprayed TLC plates were incubated for 20 min at 37 Â°C in high humidity conditions and after air-drying, they were visualized with a Fast Blue B salt solution (0.615 mg/mL). Separately, similar TLC plates were prepared without the derivatization, to be analyzed by TLC-LC-MS spectrometry for the identification purposes, as described in the
