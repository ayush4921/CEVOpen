0: A revised test for the determination of AChE inhibitory properties authored by Mroczek [ 10] was implemented in this study on diethyl ether extracts from fresh finely cut ginger rhizome and on the galantamine solution containing plate.
1: The total extract was obtained from the ginger rhizomes that, finely cut, were transferred to a mortar and mixed vigorously with diethyl ether using a pistel.
2: The obtained extract was filtered through a glass Pasteur pipette filled with silica gel to remove the water.
3: Then, it was air-dried and used for the bioactivity studies.
