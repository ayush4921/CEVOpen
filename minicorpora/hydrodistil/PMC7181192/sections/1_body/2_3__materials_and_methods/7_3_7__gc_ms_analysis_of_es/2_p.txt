0: The quantitative analysis of terpenes was performed based on the calibration curves of bornyl acetate and 1, 8-cineol.
1: Both the compounds were diluted in hexane at the concentration of 1 mg/mL.
2: Out of this stock solution, six dilutions were prepared for each compound to construct a calibration curve equation, namely: 0.5, 0.1, 0.05, 0.025, 0.01, 0.005 mg/mL.
3: The injection volume was set at 2 L.
