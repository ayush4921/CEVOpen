<p>The GC–MS analysis was performed with a Shimadzu GC-2010 Plus GC instrument coupled with a Shimadzu QP2010 Ultra mass spectrometer (Kyoto, Japan). Compounds were separated on a fused-silica capillary column ZB-5 MS (30 m, 0.25 mm i.d.) with a film thickness of 0.25 μm (Phenomenex, Torrrance, CA, USA). The following oven temperature program was initiated at 50 °C, held for 3 min, then increased to 250 °C at the rate of 5 °C/min, and held for 15 min. The spectrometers were operated in the electron impact mode, the scan range was 40–500 amu, the ionization energy was 70 eV, and the scan rate was 0.20 s per scan. The injector, interface, and ion source were kept at 280, 250, and 220 °C, respectively. A split injection was performed with a split ratio of 1:20 and helium was used as a carrier gas of 1.0 mL/min flow rate. The retention indices were determined in relation to a homologous series of 
 <italic>n</italic>-alkanes (C8–C24) under the same operating conditions. Compounds were identified using a computer-assisted spectral library (MassFinder 2.1; NIST 2011).
