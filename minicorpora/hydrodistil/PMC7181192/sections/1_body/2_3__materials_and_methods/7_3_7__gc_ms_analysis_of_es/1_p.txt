0: The GCMS analysis was performed with a Shimadzu GC-2010 Plus GC instrument coupled with a Shimadzu QP2010 Ultra mass spectrometer (Kyoto, Japan).
1: Compounds were separated on a fused-silica capillary column ZB-5 MS (30 m, 0.25 mm i.d.)
2: with a film thickness of 0.25 m (Phenomenex, Torrrance, CA, USA).
3: The following oven temperature program was initiated at 50 C, held for 3 min, then increased to 250 C at the rate of 5 C/min, and held for 15 min.
4: The spectrometers were operated in the electron impact mode, the scan range was 40500 amu, the ionization energy was 70 eV, and the scan rate was 0.20 s per scan.
5: The injector, interface, and ion source were kept at 280, 250, and 220 C, respectively.
6: A split injection was performed with a split ratio of 1:20 and helium was used as a carrier gas of 1.0 mL/min flow rate.
7: The retention indices were determined in relation to a homologous series of  n-alkanes (C8C24) under the same operating conditions.
8: Compounds were identified using a computer-assisted spectral library (MassFinder 2.1; NIST 2011).
