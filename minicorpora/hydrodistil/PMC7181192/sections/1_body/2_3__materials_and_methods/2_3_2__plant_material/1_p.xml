<p>Fresh ginger rhizomes (500 g) were purchased from a local market in Lublin, Poland. The plant material was finely cut, thoroughly mixed and directly exposed to the tests. Only the SFE extraction was performed from the dried plant material, which was dried at a temperature of 35 °C in a laminar flow herb dryer. After the extraction, the extracts were dried on a rotary evaporator at a temperature of 35 °C and the dry residue was refrigerated at 4 °C. A voucher specimen is stored in the freezer of the Chair and Department of Pharmacognosy, at the Medical University of Lublin.</p>
