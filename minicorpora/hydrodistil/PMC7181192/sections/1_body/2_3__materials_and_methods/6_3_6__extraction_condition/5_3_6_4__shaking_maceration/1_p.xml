<p>Finely cut ginger rhizomes (1 g) were placed in Eppendorf tubes and extracted with 1.2 mL of dichloromethane on a shaking platform (300 rpm) for 5, 10, 15 min and 3 × 5 min, in triplicate. After each extraction, the vials were centrifuged at 1500 rpm and the supernatants were collected in fresh vials, evaporated to dryness using an Eppendorf Concentrator Plus centrifuge, and stored at 4 °C. Before the GC-MS analysis, they were re-dissolved in 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane at a concentration of 10 mg/mL.
