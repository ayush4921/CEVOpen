0: Finely cut rhizomes (1 g) were placed in a stainless steel extraction cell and extracted with n-hexane at the following temperatures: 40, 60, and 80 C. Each extraction was performed three times.
1: The other working conditions of the ASE 100 extractor (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) were set as follows: Static time 5 min, flush volume 60%, purge time 20 s, and number of extraction cycles 3.
2: The pressure was maintained at ca.
3: 100 bar throughout the extraction process.
4: The obtained extracts were first evaporated on a rotary vacuum evaporator at a temperature of 35 C and then directly dissolved in n-hexane before the GC-MS analysis.
