<p>Ginger was sent to INS in the form of cut pieces of about 2 cm in size. These pieces were then ground on a Retsch mill (model SM100) using a 1.5 mm sieve. The raw material prepared in this way was extracted through the SITEC/Switzerland research plant. The test plant parameters were as follows: The capacity of the extractor basket was 0.6 dm
 <sup>3</sup>, the maximum working pressure was 100 MPa, and the maximum working temperature was 200 Â°C. The experiments were carried out in duplicate at 115 bar and 300 bar pressure. Other parameters such as temperature, extraction time, and flow rate were kept constant. The average CO
 <sub>2</sub> flow rate was 5.46 kg/h. The operating parameters of the research plant are summarized in
