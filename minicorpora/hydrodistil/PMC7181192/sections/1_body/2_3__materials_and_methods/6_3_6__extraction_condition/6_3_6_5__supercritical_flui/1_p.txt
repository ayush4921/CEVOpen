0: Ginger was sent to INS in the form of cut pieces of about 2 cm in size.
1: These pieces were then ground on a Retsch mill (model SM100) using a 1.5 mm sieve.
2: The raw material prepared in this way was extracted through the SITEC/Switzerland research plant.
3: The test plant parameters were as follows: The capacity of the extractor basket was 0.6 dm 3, the maximum working pressure was 100 MPa, and the maximum working temperature was 200 C. The experiments were carried out in duplicate at 115 bar and 300 bar pressure.
4: Other parameters such as temperature, extraction time, and flow rate were kept constant.
5: The average CO 2 flow rate was 5.46 kg/h.
6: The operating parameters of the research plant are summarized in  Table 4.
7: In contrast to other techniques evaluated in this study, the standard deviation values obtained for this type of extraction come from a triple injection of the same extracts.
