<p>Portions of freshly cut ginger rhizomes (1 g) were placed in twelve Eppendorf tubes and extracted with 1.2 mL of dichloromethane under the following conditions: i) 4 Eppendorf tubes at room temperature, ii) four tubes at 30 °C, and iii) the last four tubes at 60 °C. The sonication process of the ginger rhizomes was conducted at different time intervals of 5, 10, 15 min and 3 × 5 min, in triplicate. After the extraction, the vials were centrifuged, and the supernatants were transferred to an amber glass vial and evaporated to dryness at 30 °C with the help an Eppendorf Concentrator Plus (Hamburg, Germany).
