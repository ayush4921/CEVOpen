0: The imaging studies were performed with help of an open source image processing program ImageJ (v.1.48).
1: It was used for the quantitative visualization of the intensity of inhibition spots in the obtained chromatograms of the total extract and galantamine reference solution after the above described TLC bioautography assay.
2: The developed TLC plated were dried in the air and photographed.
3: The obtained JPG files were modified according to the previously published procedure by Olech and co-investigators [ 28].
4: The images were transformed to 8-bit colorless pictures to better expose the contrast between the background and bright areas of inhibition.
5: The median filter was set at 5 pixels and the FFT Bandpass filter was adjusted to 40 pixels.
6: Rectangular selection tool setting was chosen to generate the tracks profile lines with plot lines setting.
7: With help of straight line selection tool the baseline was corrected, and the tracks were presented in the forms of chromatograms with integrated peaks (wand tools settings) coming from the zones of active inhibitors.
