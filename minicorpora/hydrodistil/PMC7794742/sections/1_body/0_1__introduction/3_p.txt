0: Several studies indicate that the volatile organic compound makeup of rosewood varies from one population to another [ 8, 9, 10].
1: A number of varieties within rosewood have been recognized in the past, but are all currently considered synonyms of a single species,  A. rosiodora [ 5].
2: Due to extreme difficulties in distinguishing specimens based on morphology [ 7], it is not known whether the phytochemical variants align with the taxonomic varieties.
3: The majority of the studies focused on the chemical and genetic variability in plants from the Amazon State [ 11, 12].
4: As a further complication, rosewood is frequently misidentified as other species, such as  Aniba parviflora (Meisn.)
5: Mez, which are similar morphologically, but are not economically important as sources of essential oils [ 13].
