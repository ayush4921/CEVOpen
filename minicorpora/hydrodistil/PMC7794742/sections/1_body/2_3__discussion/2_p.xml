<p>The evaluation of the non-volatile compound composition of the leaves, bark, and stems of the samples from FLONA and RESEX indicated a clear distinction between the two populations. The PCA analyses of the mass spectra data pinpointed the pyrone anibine, formerly isolated from 
 <italic>A. duckei</italic> Kosterm. (synon. 
 <italic>A. rosiodora</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-26-00069" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], as the main compound responsible for differentiating leaves and stem samples from FLONA. Bark samples from the same location presented reticuline, a benzylisoquinoline alkaloid previously identified in the trunk of 
 <italic>Aniba</italic> species [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-26-00069" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The presence of a pyrone, 6-styryl-2-pyrone, was crucial for the separation of samples from RESEX. This compound was previously isolated from the leaves of 
 <italic>A. parviflora</italic> [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-26-00069" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-26-00069" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. It is worth noting that both pyrones share a parallel biosynthetic sequence with a common chain elongation step carried out by polyketide synthase-type enzymes, but that differs in the starting units in which nicotinic acid and cinnamic acid are involved to produce anibine and 6-styryl-2-pyrone, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00069-f007">Figure 7</xref>). Among the few studies on Pará state samples, 
 <italic>A. rosiodora</italic> from Emílio Goeldi Museum campus (city of Belém), the flavonoid pinocembrin was the major compound identified in the leaves, using mass spectra [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-26-00069" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Analysis of seedling’s leaves from 
 <italic>A. rosiodora</italic> collected in the Ducke Forest Reserve (Manaus, Amazonas) indicated the benzophenones cotoin and hydroxycotoin as key compounds for these seedlings [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-26-00069" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Cotoin is found in high amounts in the 
 <italic>A. rosiodora</italic> woods [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-26-00069" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], but is not common in leaves. These results indicate that the chemical composition of 
 <italic>A. rosiodora</italic> populations diverge considerably from one another, not only for samples from opposite banks of the Tapajós river, but also for 
 <italic>A. rosiodora</italic> from different locations in the Amazon forest.
