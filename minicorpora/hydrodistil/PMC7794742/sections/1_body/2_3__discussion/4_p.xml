<p>Despite the long history of rosewood exploitation, neither the chemical nor the genetic variability of plants from Pará State classified as 
 <italic>A. rosiodora</italic> has been evaluated. This study shows that considerable dissimilarities exist in essential oil and non-volatile compound composition between two populations morphologically identified as 
 <italic>A. rosiodora</italic>, indicating the presence of different chemotypes in this species. Higher amounts of the linalool were detected in the samples from FLONA, comparing to the RESEX samples that, on the other hand, present α-phellandrene in their essential oil composition. In the compound 6-styryl-2-pyrone, which characterizes the separation of the plants from RESEX, however, anibine and reticuline were distinctive for FLONA samples. The evaluation of phylogenetic patterns provides further evidence for differentiation between the populations of this economically important species.
