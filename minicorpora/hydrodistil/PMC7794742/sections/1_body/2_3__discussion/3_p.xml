<p>The phylogeny of 
 <italic>Aniba</italic> presented here (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00069-f006">Figure 6</xref>) includes limited sampling (ca. 10% of the species of the genus [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-26-00069" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]), but shows several clear patterns. The Brazilian species form a moderately to well-supported clade that is sister to 
 <italic>A. cinnamomiflora</italic> from Costa Rica, Panama, and Venezuela and 
 <italic>A. hypoglauca</italic>, which is restricted to Guyana and Surinam. Among the Brazilian species, the two clades comprising linages of 
 <italic>A. rosiodora</italic>—one including collections from FLONA, Manaus, and Presidente Figueiredo, and the other from RESEX—are supported as separate in all analyses. These results suggest that some of the formerly recognized infraspecific taxa may, in fact, represent discrete lineages with unique phytochemical compositions.
