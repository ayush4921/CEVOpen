 <italic>Aniba rosiodora</italic> is widespread in the Amazonian basin, but data describing the phytochemical and genetic variation among populations are scarce and most of them focus on Amazonas State specimen variability. In this article, we analyzed two populations from Pará State located in the opposite banks of Tapajós River. This species has long been exploited because the essential oil has a high content of the terpenoid linalool, a compound appreciated by the perfumery industry. The presence of this compound at high concentrations (&gt;30%) is one of the characters that has facilitated the identification of this species [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-26-00069" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], since the presence of linalool is rare in the genus 
 <italic>Aniba</italic> [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-26-00069" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and is present in only a few other species (
 <italic>A. terminalis</italic>, 
 <italic>A. riparia</italic>, and 
 <italic>A. parviflora</italic>; [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-26-00069" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-26-00069" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-26-00069" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]). The amount of linalool in the essential oils is variable across populations, and in FLONA and RESEX were on average 83% and 39% of the total content, respectively. Not only is the amount of linalool variable between these two populations, but the composition of the essential oils is also variable. Samples from FLONA have a high percentage of linalool and lack phellandrene, whereas the RESEX samples have a much lower linalool content, but had over 22% phellandrene.
