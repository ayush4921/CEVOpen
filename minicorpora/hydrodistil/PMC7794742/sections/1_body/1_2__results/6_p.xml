<p>To explore further the relationships among the samples of 
 <italic>Aniba</italic>, a phylogenetic analysis of the samples was performed. The aligned matrices for the plastid 
 <italic>psbA</italic>–
 <italic>trnH</italic>, 
 <italic>psbD</italic>–
 <italic>trnT</italic>, 
 <italic>trnC</italic>–
 <italic>rpoB</italic>, and 
 <italic>trnS</italic>–
 <italic>trnG</italic> sequences contained 454, 1467, 1057, and 829 characters, respectively, of which 25, 4, and 0 were variable. The aligned, concatenated matrix contained 3807 characters. Of these, a total of 27 (0.8%) characters were variable, and 20 (0.5%) were parsimony informative. All 20 of the parsimony informative characters came from 
 <italic>psbA</italic>–
 <italic>trnH</italic>.
