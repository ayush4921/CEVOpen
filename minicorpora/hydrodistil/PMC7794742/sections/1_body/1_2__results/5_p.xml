<p>Since samples of 
 <italic>A. rosiodora</italic> from these two locations presented considerable differences in their volatile organic compounds and methanolic extract composition, samples of 
 <italic>A. parviflora</italic> from Santarém (Pará) and 
 <italic>A. rosiodora</italic> from Presidente Figueiredo (Amazonas) were also analyzed for comparison with the 
 <italic>Aniba</italic> samples from FLONA and RESEX using 
 <sup>1</sup>H-NMR data. The NMR spectra of FLONA, RESEX, and other samples are in the 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-00069">Supplementary Data (Figure S2)</xref>. Analysis of the data was focused on the region between 3.0 and 9.5 ppm to eliminate signals from highly lipophilic compounds (fatty acids). The 
 <italic>A. rosiodora</italic> samples from RESEX were clustered apart from samples of 
 <italic>A. parviflora</italic>, 
 <italic>A. rosiodora</italic> from Presidente Figueiredo, and FLONA, which were all arranged in a distinct cluster (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00069-f005">Figure 5</xref>). An analysis of the 
 <sup>1</sup>H-NMR data from crude methanolic extracts reveals complex spectra profiles and the inspection of the loading plot indicates groups of signals differentiating each sample, but the annotation of the compounds was not achievable (
