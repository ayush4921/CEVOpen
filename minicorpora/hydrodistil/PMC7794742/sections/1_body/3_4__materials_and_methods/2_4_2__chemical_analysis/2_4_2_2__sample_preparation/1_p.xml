<p>Samples of 
 <italic>A. rosiodora</italic> from FLONA and RESEX were collected, and leaves (L), stems (S), and bark (B) were dried in an oven at 40 Â°C for 24 h and then ground. Powdered samples of each part (200 mg) were extracted with MeOH (HPLC grade) (2 mL) using a crushing disperser (Ultra-Turrax T 25 basic IKA, Staufen, Germany)) for 1 min at 6500 rpm. The extracts were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatants were collected for analyses (modified from Matsuda et al., 2011 [
