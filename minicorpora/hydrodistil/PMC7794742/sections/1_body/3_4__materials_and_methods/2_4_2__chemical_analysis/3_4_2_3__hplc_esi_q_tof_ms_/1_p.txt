0: The analyses of ElectroSpray Ionization High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry (ESI-HRMS) were performed in a MicrOTOFQ-II Bruker Daltonics mass spectrometer (Q-Tof analyzer, Bremen, Germany) coupled to a Shimadzu HPLC (Kyoto, Japan) system consisting of two pumps LC-20AD, automatic injector SIL-20A, column oven CTO-20A and controller CBM-10A.
1: A Phenomenex Luna 5 m (150  3 mm, 100 A particle size) column was used.
2: The column oven was kept at 30 C, and chromatography was performed with a flow of 500 L/min using MeOH:H 2O as the mobile phase in a gradient of 0 min 20% of MeOH held until 5 min, from 5 to 30 min 20 to 100% MeOH.
3: The mass spectrometer was operating in electrospray positive mode, with nebulization and drying gas at 4 Bar and 8 L/min, respectively.
4: The capillary voltage was set to 4500 V, and the drying temperature was set to 200 C. The collision cell and quadrupole energy were set to 12 eV and 6 eV, respectively.
5: Samples were prepared by dissolving 50 L of the supernatant collected directly from the extracts in 950 L of MeOH, and filtered (Millex PTFE, 0.45 m); 10 L of this sample was injected into the equipment.
6: The HPLC-MS raw data were analyzed by XCMS online software 21, and multivariate analyses were performed using Unscrambler software version 10 (CAMO Analytics, Oslo, Norway).
