0: One hundred grams of fresh cut aerial parts (leaves and thin branches approximately 6 mm in diameter) of specimens from FLONA (5 individuals) and RESEX (10 individuals) were extracted in triplicate (300 g total), by hydrodistillation for 3 h using a Clevenger apparatus in proportion 1:10 ( w/ v).
1: The essential oil percentage was calculated based on the dry weight of the plant material [ 25], and the humidity of the samples was determined in triplicate using a thermogravimetric moisture analyzer balance (Celtac model DHS-16 A).
2: The average humidity was 49.02% and 58.05% for the FLONA and RESEX samples, respectively.
3: GC-MS analyses were performed using an Agilent instrument (model 6850, Santa Clara, CA, USA) with a DB-5HT capillary column (30 m  0.25 mm, film thickness 0.10 m).
4: The initial oven temperature was 66 C, which was increased by 5 C/min to 220 C. The injector and detector temperatures were 250 C and 230 C, respectively.
5: The sample was injected using a split ratio of 50:1.
6: The electron impact was set to 70 eV and was monitored in the range of 20 to 500  m/ z with 1.56 scans/s.
7: Retention indexes were calculated relative to C8-C24 n-alkanes, and the identification of essential oil components was based on NIST MS data library version 2.0, followed by comparisons with published literature [ 26, 27, 28].
