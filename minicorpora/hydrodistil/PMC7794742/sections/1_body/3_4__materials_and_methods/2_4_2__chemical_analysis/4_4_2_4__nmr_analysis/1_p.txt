0: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses were performed using 10 mg of MeOH extract dissolved in 800 L of CDCl 3 (99.8% Cambridge Isotopes Laboratories TM) containing 0.05% TMS (tetramethylsilane).
1: The  1H-NMR (Bruker DPX 200 MHz) spectra were obtained operating at a hydrogen NMR frequency of 200.13 MHz with a 5 mm probe.
2: The spectra consisted of 256 scans and 300 k data points, with a pulse width of 8.0 s (30) and a relaxation delay of 1.0 s. The processing of the spectra was performed in the MestReNova (version 6.0.2-5475) program by automatic Fourier transformation using a line broadening of 0.3 Hz.
3: TMS was used as an internal standard, and the residual hydrogen signal of CDCl 3 was referenced at 7.26 ppm.
4: The integration of the spectra signals was carried out into regions of equal width (0.05 ppm) of the region  3.009.50 ppm.
5: The region containing residues of chloroform (7.0 to 7.4 ppm) was excluded from each spectrum.
6: The multivariate analysis was performed using Unscrambler software version 10 (CAMO Analytics).
