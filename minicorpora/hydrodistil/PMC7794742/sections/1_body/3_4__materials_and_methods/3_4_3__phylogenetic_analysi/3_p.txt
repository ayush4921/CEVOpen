0: Bayesian inference analysis was performed using MrBayes 3.2.2 [ 34, 35].
1: The nucleotide substitution model [ 36] (F81) was selected using MrModeltest 2.2 [ 37].
2: MrBayes was run for 10,000,000 generations, with one tree sampled every 1000 generations and all other settings as the defaults.
3: The first 25% of trees were discarded as burn-in before constructing the majority rule consensus tree and calculating posterior probabilities.
4: Maximum parsimony analyses were performed using PAUP* 4.0a166 [ 38] using an exhaustive search with default parameters.
5: Bootstrap values for nodes were estimated from a branch and bound search of 5000 replicates.
