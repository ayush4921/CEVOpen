0: Total genomic DNA was isolated from silica gel-dried leaf material using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA, USA).
1: PCR amplification was carried out using GoTaq Green Master Mix following the manufacturers protocol (Promega Corp., Madison, WI, USA).
2: The four molecular markers from the chloroplast genome used were  psbA trhH [ 30],  psbD trnT [ 31],  trnC rpoB [ 32], and  trnS trnG [ 33].
3: After confirming amplification on agarose gels, amplified products were sent to Beckman-Coulter Genomics, Inc. (Danvers, MA, USA) for purification, labeling, and sequencing.
4: Forward and reverse sequences were assembled and aligned in Geneious R11 ( https://www.geneious.com).
