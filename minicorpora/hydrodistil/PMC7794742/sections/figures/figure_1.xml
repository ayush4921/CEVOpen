  <p>Results of a principal component analysis (PCA) from ESIHRMS data, illustrating the relationship between samples of 
   <italic>A. rosiodora</italic> from FLONA and RESEX reserves. (
   <bold>A</bold>) The score plot and (
   <bold>B</bold>) the PCA derived loading plot, presenting the contribution of RT/(
   <italic>m</italic>/
   <italic>z</italic>) data with cumulative 82% variance within the two components (PC1 and PC2). Samples are coded by “locality_tissue type”, with R = RESEX, F = FLONA, B = bark, S = stems, and L = leaves.
