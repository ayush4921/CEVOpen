0: For the extraction of the essential oil of  O. basilicum, a new method was developed based on the association of hydrodistillation and ultrasound techniques.
1: The extractions were carried out by hydrodistillation using a Clevenger-type apparatus with samples of 20 g of hand-grounded leaves dried under different temperatures.
2: The crushed leaves were placed in a 250 mL flask.
3: The balloon was attached to Clevenger and placed in an ultrasound device (Cristofoli, Parana, Brazil), where it was submerged in water at 100 C and subjected to different sonication (0, 8, 19, 31 and 38 min) and hydrodistillation (20, 30, 45, 60 and 70 min) times ( Figure 9).
4: At the end of this period, the essential oil was collected and separated from the hydrolate by freezing.
5: The extracted oil was quantified and its yield was calculated.
