<p>For the extraction of the essential oil of 
 <italic>O. basilicum</italic>, a new method was developed based on the association of hydrodistillation and ultrasound techniques. The extractions were carried out by hydrodistillation using a Clevenger-type apparatus with samples of 20 g of hand-grounded leaves dried under different temperatures. The crushed leaves were placed in a 250 mL flask. The balloon was attached to Clevenger and placed in an ultrasound device (Cristófoli, Paraná, Brazil), where it was submerged in water at 100 °C and subjected to different sonication (0, 8, 19, 31 and 38 min) and hydrodistillation (20, 30, 45, 60 and 70 min) times (
