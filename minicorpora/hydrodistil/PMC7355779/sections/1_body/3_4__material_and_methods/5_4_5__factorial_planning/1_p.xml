<p>The extraction of essential oil was optimized in order to reduce the extraction time and maintain the quality of the oil using a central composite design with six repetitions at the central point (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-02781-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Three variables were studied: ultrasound sonication time (UST), hydrodistillation time (HDT) and leaves drying temperature (DT). The variables were studied at two levels and the analyzes were performed in triplicate. The effects of each variable and the interactions between variables on oil yield and mortality of
