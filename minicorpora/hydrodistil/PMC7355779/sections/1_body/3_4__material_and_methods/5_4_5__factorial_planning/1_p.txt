0: The extraction of essential oil was optimized in order to reduce the extraction time and maintain the quality of the oil using a central composite design with six repetitions at the central point ( Table 1).
1: Three variables were studied: ultrasound sonication time (UST), hydrodistillation time (HDT) and leaves drying temperature (DT).
2: The variables were studied at two levels and the analyzes were performed in triplicate.
3: The effects of each variable and the interactions between variables on oil yield and mortality of  S. zeamais, were calculated using the software Statistica 12.0 (StatSoft Corp., Tulsa, OK, USA).
4: The data were presented in graphs generated using the SigmaPlot 12.5 software (Systat Software, San Jose, CA, USA).
