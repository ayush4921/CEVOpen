<p>A GC2010 gas chromatograph (Shimadzu) equipped with a flame ionization detector (GC-FID) was used for the quantification of the main components of samples of 
 <italic>O. Basilicum</italic> essential oil. The best extraction conditions obtained from factorial planning were evaluated by comparing the peak area values (chromatographic responses) for the analytes of interest in each assay. Chromatographic separation was performed on a DB-5 capillary column (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA), with a stationary phase composed of 5% phenyl and 95% dimethylsiloxane (30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.10 µm film thickness). Nitrogen (99.999%, Air Products, São Paulo, Brazil) was used as carrier gas in a flow of 1.82 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup> and a split ratio of 1:5. Injector and detector temperatures were set at 220 and 300 °C, respectively. The initial column temperature was 60 °C with heating rate at 7 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup> up to 120 °C and maintained at this temperature for 1 min. The total time of analysis was 8.5 min. Five solutions of essential oil were injected at a concentration of 10 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> in toluene, in three repetitions. Chromatographic parameters were managed using CGsolution software (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The compounds were identified by comparing the retention times of the peaks obtained for samples of the essential oil and those of the standards. The concentration of each compound was calculated based on their chromatographic area and the analytical curve of each compound.
