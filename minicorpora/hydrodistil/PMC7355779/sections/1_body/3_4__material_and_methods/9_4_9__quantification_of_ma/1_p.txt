0: A GC2010 gas chromatograph (Shimadzu) equipped with a flame ionization detector (GC-FID) was used for the quantification of the main components of samples of  O. Basilicum essential oil.
1: The best extraction conditions obtained from factorial planning were evaluated by comparing the peak area values (chromatographic responses) for the analytes of interest in each assay.
2: Chromatographic separation was performed on a DB-5 capillary column (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA), with a stationary phase composed of 5% phenyl and 95% dimethylsiloxane (30 m  0.25 mm, 0.10 m film thickness).
3: Nitrogen (99.999%, Air Products, Sao Paulo, Brazil) was used as carrier gas in a flow of 1.82 mL min 1 and a split ratio of 1:5.
4: Injector and detector temperatures were set at 220 and 300 C, respectively.
5: The initial column temperature was 60 C with heating rate at 7 C min 1 up to 120 C and maintained at this temperature for 1 min.
6: The total time of analysis was 8.5 min.
7: Five solutions of essential oil were injected at a concentration of 10 mg mL 1 in toluene, in three repetitions.
8: Chromatographic parameters were managed using CGsolution software (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan).
9: The compounds were identified by comparing the retention times of the peaks obtained for samples of the essential oil and those of the standards.
10: The concentration of each compound was calculated based on their chromatographic area and the analytical curve of each compound.
