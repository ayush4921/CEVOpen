0: The identification and the relative percentage of the compounds of the essential oil were carried out at the Chemistry Department of the of Universidade Federal de Vicosa (UFV), Brazil.
1: The essential oil of  O. basilicum was analyzed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) using a QP2010 system (Shimadzu, Japan) under the following conditions: capillary column of fused silica (30 m length and 0.25 mm of internal diameter) with RTX -5MS stationary phase (0.25 m film thickness) and helium as carrier gas with a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min.
2: Injector temperature of 220 C and initial temperature of the column as 60 C. Heating rate was set to increase 2 C min 1 up to 200 C, and 5 C min 1 up to 250 C. The mass spectra were obtained by electron impact at 70 eV, with a scan from 29 to 400 ( m/ z).
3: Samples of the extracted oil were diluted in toluene to the concentration of 10 mg mL 1 and 1 L was injected with a split ratio of 1:20.
4: The total analysis time was 80 min.
5: The identification of the compounds was carried out by comparing the mass spectra in the NIST library, visual interpretation of the mass spectra and confirmed by Kovats Index (KI) calculation and comparison with the literature [ 22].
6: The KI of each compound was calculated based on the retention time of the compounds and the alkanes of the standard solution of alkanes.
7: The relative percentage of each compound was calculated using the ratio between the area of each peak and the total area of all constituents in the sample.
