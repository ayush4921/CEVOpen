0: The validation of the method was developed according to the standards of the guide [ 25].
1: Solutions of both compounds in concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 100 mg mL 1 were used to construct the analytical curve of linalool and estragole.
2: The limits of detection and quantification of the analytical curve of linalool and estragole were determined by means of signal-to-noise.
