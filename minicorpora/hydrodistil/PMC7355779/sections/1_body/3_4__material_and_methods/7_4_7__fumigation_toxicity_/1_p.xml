<p>The bioassays were performed in 0.8 L glass flasks (8 cm in diameter × 15 cm in height) with 50 adults of non-sexed 
 <italic>S. zeamais</italic>, in four replicates. The concentration of essential oil used was 20 μL L
 <sup>−1</sup> of air. The working solutions with samples of the the essential oil were prepared using toluene as solvent and applied with a microsyringe (Hamilton, Reno, NV, USA) on filter-paper discs with a diameter of 4.4 cm placed in Petri dishes (diameter 6.5 cm). The Petri dishes were covered with organza fabric and placed at the bottom of the flasks. 25 μL of pure solvent (toluene) was used as a control. After the distribution of the insects, the flasks were closed with a screw-on metallic cap and sealed with parafilm PM996 (American, Neenah, USA) to avoid leakage of volatiles from the essential oil during the exposure period. The flasks were kept for 24 h in a B.O.D. (model 347 CD, Fanem, São Paulo, Brazil) at a temperature of 27 ± 2 °C. After this period, dead and live insects were counted. The mortality of 
 <italic>S. zeamais</italic> exposed to the essential oil was corrected in relation to the mortality of insects exposed to the solvent using Abbott’s formula [
