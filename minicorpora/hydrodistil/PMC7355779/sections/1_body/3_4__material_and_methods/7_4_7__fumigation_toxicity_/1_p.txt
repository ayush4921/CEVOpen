0: The bioassays were performed in 0.8 L glass flasks (8 cm in diameter  15 cm in height) with 50 adults of non-sexed  S. zeamais, in four replicates.
1: The concentration of essential oil used was 20 L L 1 of air.
2: The working solutions with samples of the the essential oil were prepared using toluene as solvent and applied with a microsyringe (Hamilton, Reno, NV, USA) on filter-paper discs with a diameter of 4.4 cm placed in Petri dishes (diameter 6.5 cm).
3: The Petri dishes were covered with organza fabric and placed at the bottom of the flasks.
4: 25 L of pure solvent (toluene) was used as a control.
5: After the distribution of the insects, the flasks were closed with a screw-on metallic cap and sealed with parafilm PM996 (American, Neenah, USA) to avoid leakage of volatiles from the essential oil during the exposure period.
6: The flasks were kept for 24 h in a B.O.D.
7: (model 347 CD, Fanem, Sao Paulo, Brazil) at a temperature of 27  2 C. After this period, dead and live insects were counted.
8: The mortality of  S. zeamais exposed to the essential oil was corrected in relation to the mortality of insects exposed to the solvent using Abbotts formula [ 57].
