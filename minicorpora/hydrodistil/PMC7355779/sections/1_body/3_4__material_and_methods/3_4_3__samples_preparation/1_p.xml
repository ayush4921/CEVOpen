<p>A greenhouse with forced air circulation (Didática SP 1152 L, São Paulo, Brazil) was used for drying 
 <italic>O. basilicum</italic> leaves. Six perforated trays with 100 g of fresh leaves each were used. During the drying process, the trays were weighed at intervals of 30 min on a semi-analytical scale (Gehaka, São Paulo, Brazil, model BG 4400, with accuracy of ±0.01/0.1 g), in order to control the drying until they reached constant weight. Five drying temperatures of leaves (20, 30, 45, 60 and 70 °C) were used and the experiment was conducted using factorial design (
