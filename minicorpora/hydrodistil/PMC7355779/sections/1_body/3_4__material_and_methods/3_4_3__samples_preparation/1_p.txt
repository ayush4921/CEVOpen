0: A greenhouse with forced air circulation (Didatica SP 1152 L, Sao Paulo, Brazil) was used for drying  O. basilicum leaves.
1: Six perforated trays with 100 g of fresh leaves each were used.
2: During the drying process, the trays were weighed at intervals of 30 min on a semi-analytical scale (Gehaka, Sao Paulo, Brazil, model BG 4400, with accuracy of 0.01/0.1 g), in order to control the drying until they reached constant weight.
3: Five drying temperatures of leaves (20, 30, 45, 60 and 70 C) were used and the experiment was conducted using factorial design ( Table 5).
