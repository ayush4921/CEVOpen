<p>Results of the central composite planning show that the variables investigated (drying temperature, time of sonication by ultrasound and hydrodistillation time) were significant (
 <italic>p</italic> â‰¤ 0.05) for the toxicity of the essential oil of 
 <italic>O. basilicum</italic> to 
 <italic>S. zeamais</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02781-f004">Figure 4</xref>). Linear effects for sonication time, hydrodistillation time, drying temperature, and the linear interaction of sonication time and drying temperature were signigicant. On the other hand, quadratic effects for sonication time and and hydrodistillation were also significant.
