<p>According to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02781-f001">Figure 1</xref>, the higher yields of essential oil were proportional to the increase in drying temperature, hydrodistillation time and ultrasound time. The highest yield of essential oil and greater toxicity on adults of 
 <italic>S. zeamais</italic> were obtained in treatments 7, 12, 14, 25 and 27 (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-02781-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) with ultrasound times of 19, 31 and 38 min, hydrodistillation time of 45, 60 and 70 min and drying temperature 30, 45, 60 and 70 Â°C. The lowest yield of essential oil was obtained in treatments 9 and 26, in which there was no use of ultrasound in the extraction, which shows that the longer the exposure time to ultrasound and hydrodistillation, the greater the yield of essential oil. The yield of the EO of 
 <italic>O. basilicum</italic> also increased with the increase in the drying temperature of its leaves (
