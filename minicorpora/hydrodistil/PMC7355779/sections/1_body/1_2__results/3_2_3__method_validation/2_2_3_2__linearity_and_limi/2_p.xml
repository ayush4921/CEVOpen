<p>The limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) of the method were calculated as the concentration giving a signal-to-noise ratio of three (S/N = 3) and ten (S/N = 10), respectively. In this study, the LOD and LOQ obtained for linalool was 2.19 and 6.62 µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> and for estragole was 2.001 and 6.063 µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively.
