0: The analytical curve is described by the relationship between the theoretical concentration of the analyte in the sample and the chromatographic area.
1: Linearity was evaluated by analyzing samples of linalool and estragole in different concentrations (0.5; 5; 10; 20; 30; 50 and 60 mg mL 1 for linalool) (0.25; 0.5; 1; 5; 10; 50 and 100 mg mL 1 for estragole) and subjected to the extraction and analysis method.
2: The data were used to construct analytical curves ( n = 7, analyzed in triplicates) relating the chromatographic area of the analytes versus their concentrations.
3: The determination coefficient ( R2) obtained for both compounds were >0.99, which indicates the good linearity of the method for the concentration range evaluated ( Figure 8A,B).
