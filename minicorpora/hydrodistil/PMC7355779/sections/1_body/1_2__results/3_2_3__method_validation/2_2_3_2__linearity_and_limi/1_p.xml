<p>The analytical curve is described by the relationship between the theoretical concentration of the analyte in the sample and the chromatographic area. Linearity was evaluated by analyzing samples of linalool and estragole in different concentrations (0.5; 5; 10; 20; 30; 50 and 60 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> for linalool) (0.25; 0.5; 1; 5; 10; 50 and 100 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> for estragole) and subjected to the extraction and analysis method. The data were used to construct analytical curves (
 <italic>n</italic> = 7, analyzed in triplicates) relating the chromatographic area of the analytes versus their concentrations. The determination coefficient (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup>) obtained for both compounds were &gt;0.99, which indicates the good linearity of the method for the concentration range evaluated (
