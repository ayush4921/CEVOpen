0: The limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) of the method were calculated as the concentration giving a signal-to-noise ratio of three (S/N = 3) and ten (S/N = 10), respectively.
1: In this study, the LOD and LOQ obtained for linalool was 2.19 and 6.62 g mL 1 and for estragole was 2.001 and 6.063 g mL 1, respectively.
