0: To assess selectivity, the optimized method was applied to samples of linalool and estragole.
1: The chromatograms for these samples are shown in  Figure 7.
2: The comparison of the two chromatograms shows that there are no coincident peaks between the original sample of toluene and the sample with the compounds, thus the analytes of interest are not affected by the analytes of the original sample, which proves the good selectivity of the proposed method.
