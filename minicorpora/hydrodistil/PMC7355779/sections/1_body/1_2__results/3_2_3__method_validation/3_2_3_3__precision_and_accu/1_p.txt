0: Precision and accuracy were assessed at the levels of 14 g mL 1 (2  LOQ), 35 g mL 1 (5  LOQ) and 70 g mL 1 (10  LOQ) in seven replicates ( Table 4).
1: The method showed good extraction efficiency and analytical frequency at the concentrations used with a coefficient of variation 6.4%.
2: For the three concentration levels evaluated, the average recovery ranged from 71 to 77% for linalool and of 74 to 106% for estragole.
3: Recoveries between 70 and 120% and coefficients of variation lower than 20% for analytes are considered satisfactory, indicating the accuracy and precision of the method [ 23].
