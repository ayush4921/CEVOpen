 <xref rid="molecules-25-02781-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The method showed good extraction efficiency and analytical frequency at the concentrations used with a coefficient of variation ≤6.4%. For the three concentration levels evaluated, the average recovery ranged from 71 to 77% for linalool and of 74 to 106% for estragole. Recoveries between 70 and 120% and coefficients of variation lower than 20% for analytes are considered satisfactory, indicating the accuracy and precision of the method [
