<p>The concentration of each compound was calculated based on their chromatographic area and the analytical curve of each compound. The highest amount of linalool (12.2 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) and estragole (51.6 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) was obtained in the samples extracted with an ultrasound time of 31 min, 60 min of hydrodistillation and drying temperature of leaves of 30 °C (
