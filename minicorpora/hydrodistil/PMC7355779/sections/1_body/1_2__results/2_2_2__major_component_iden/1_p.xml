<p>The chemical composition of the essential oil of the leaves of 
 <italic>O. basilicum</italic> was carried out using GC-MS. The main constituents were identified by comparison of the mass spectrum of the compounds with the NIST 14 library spectra and by calculating the Kovats index for a series of saturated alkanes (C
 <sub>7</sub>â€“C
 <sub>30</sub>) (49451-U, 99.0%, Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA). Chromatographic analysis showed the presence of two major constituents in the basil EO (
