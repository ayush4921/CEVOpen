<p>The method of extracting the essential oil of 
 <italic>O. basilicum</italic> by the association of ultrasound and hydrodistillation techniques was developed and validated. In general, the highest amount of linalool and estragole was obtained in the samples extracted with an ultrasound time of 31 min, 60 min of hydrodistillation and drying temperature of leaves of 30 Â°C. The bioactivity of the essential oil was assessed by its toxicity to 
 <italic>S. zeamais</italic>, which increased with the use of ultrasound in the extraction process.
