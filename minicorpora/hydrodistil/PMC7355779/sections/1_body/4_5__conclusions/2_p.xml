<p>The validation of the optimized method assessed for its selectivity, limits of detection and quantification, linearity, accuracy and precision showed that the proposed method is sensitive, precise and accurate (mean recoveries were between 71 and 106%), with coefficient of variation ≤6.4%. Values of LOD and LOQ for linalool were 2.19 and 6.62 µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> and for estragole 2.001 and 6.063 µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. Clevenger method and ultrasound were, for the first time, combined into a method for the extraction of essential oil of
