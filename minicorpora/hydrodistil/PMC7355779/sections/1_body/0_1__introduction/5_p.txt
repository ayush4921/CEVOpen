0: Ultrasonication is another promising technique that has been applied in the pre-treatment of plant parts.
1: It is applied to avoid the use of solvents and reduce the processing time for the extraction of essential oils [ 5].
2: The technique has also been applied to improve the extraction of polysaccharides and essential oils from plant material, mainly through the phenomenon of cavitation [ 15, 16].
3: The mechanical effect of ultrasound might accelerate the release of organic compounds contained in the plants body due to cell action, wall rupture, intensification of mass transfer and greater ease of solvent access to cell content [ 16].
