<p>Several techniques are used for the extraction of essential oils, such as: classic distillation of water vapor, percolation, extraction of solid fluid and the supercritical fluid extraction method [

 <xref rid="B9-molecules-25-02781" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Despite of being the most widely used method, it has some important deficiencies, such as the difficulty of controlling heat transfer in a constant manner throughout the process and extensive time of extraction. Thus, resulting in higher operational costs and can induce the hydrolysis of some essential oil constituents. All of that might reduce yield and cause losses of volatile compounds due to prolonged heating [
