0: More modern versions of the essential oil extraction system have been used.
1: Microwave heating can be used for distillation or pre-treatment [ 11, 12].
2: As pre-treatment, it is possible to use enzymatic digestion, where different fiber breakdowns (cellulase, hemicellulase, xylanase), pectin degradation (pectinase) or other enzymes (such as protease) are used [ 13, 14].
3: Microwave-assisted hydrodistillation (MHD) usually involves the use of freshly harvested parts of plants, since the required water vapor is provided by the natural moisture of the plant.
