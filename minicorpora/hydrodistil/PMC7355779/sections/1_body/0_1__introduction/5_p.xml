<p>Ultrasonication is another promising technique that has been applied in the pre-treatment of plant parts. It is applied to avoid the use of solvents and reduce the processing time for the extraction of essential oils [

 <xref rid="B16-molecules-25-02781" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The mechanical effect of ultrasound might accelerate the release of organic compounds contained in the plantâ€™s body due to cell action, wall rupture, intensification of mass transfer and greater ease of solvent access to cell content [
