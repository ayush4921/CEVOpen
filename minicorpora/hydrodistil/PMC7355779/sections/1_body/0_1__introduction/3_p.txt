0: Several techniques are used for the extraction of essential oils, such as: classic distillation of water vapor, percolation, extraction of solid fluid and the supercritical fluid extraction method [ 8].
1: Steam distillation (SD) is presented in one of the most conventional methods, hydrodistillation (HD), where the vapor evolves from the herbs suspension in the balloon.
2: Hydrodistillation is carried out using the Clevenger apparatus [ 9].
3: Despite of being the most widely used method, it has some important deficiencies, such as the difficulty of controlling heat transfer in a constant manner throughout the process and extensive time of extraction.
4: Thus, resulting in higher operational costs and can induce the hydrolysis of some essential oil constituents.
5: All of that might reduce yield and cause losses of volatile compounds due to prolonged heating [ 10].
