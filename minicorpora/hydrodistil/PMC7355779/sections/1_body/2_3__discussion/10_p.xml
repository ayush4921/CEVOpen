<p>The higher quality of essential oil extracted with the use of ultrasound can be attributed to lower degradation of thermosensitive compounds [

 <xref rid="B53-molecules-25-02781" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In addition, changes in composition are related to facilitated release of essential oils from secretory glands or to transformations of unstable chemical compounds during ultrasound application [

 <italic>Daucus carota</italic>, the use of ultrasound in the pre-treatment promoted an increase in the concentration of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes [
