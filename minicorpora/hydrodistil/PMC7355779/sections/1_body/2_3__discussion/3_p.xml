<p>The yield of EO of 
 <italic>O. basilicum</italic> increased with the increase in the drying temperature of its leaves. Similar results were obtained for lemongrass essential oil, whose yield increased with an increase in the drying temperature [

 <italic>Tanaecium nocturnum</italic> was evaluated by Pimentel et al. and the authors concluded that the increase on drying temperature (30–40 °C) did not affect the oil content, but caused losses and variations in the amounts of its compounds [
