<p>The longer time of ultrasound and hydrodistillation in the extraction of basil essential oil caused greater mortality in 
 <italic>S. zeamais</italic>, which means that in addition to increasing the yield of EO, such extraction conditions increased its toxicity to adults of 
 <italic>S. zeamais</italic>. The optimized extraction conditions provided higher yield and also higher bioactivity of the essential oil against a major insect pest of stored grains. This may be due to the use of ultrasound that increased the extraction of bioactive compounds and, consequently, improved the biological activity of the essential oil obtained [

Although not assessed in the present study, the enantiomeric ratio of chiral compounds might account for the differences observed in the biological activity of the essential oil extracted under different conditions against
