<p>The increase in yield of EO of 
 <italic>O. basilicum</italic> after using ultrasound in the extraction process might be due to the cavitation generated by sound waves, releasing heat, causing the rupture of plant cells and, therefore, increasing the extraction efficiency [

 <italic>Salvia</italic> essential oil also increased after its extraction with the use of ultrasound sonication [
