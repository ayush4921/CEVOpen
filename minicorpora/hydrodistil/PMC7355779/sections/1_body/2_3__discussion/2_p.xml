<p>The use of ultrasound as a pre-treatment, for example, allows a reduction of about 70% in the extraction time in relation to conventional hydrodistillation. In addition, these conditions allow an increase in the extraction of bioactive compounds and consequently improve the antioxidant and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils obtained [
