<p>The highest amount of linalool and estragole was obtained in the samples extracted with an ultrasound time of 31 min, 60 min of hydrodistillation and a drying temperature of 30 °C. Generally low drying temperatures (up to 30 °C) tend to preserve the chemical composition of essential oils since high temperatures can cause losses and chemical changes in their volatile compounds [
