 <p>The activity of 
  <italic>Tagetes minuta</italic> essential oil (TMEO) was tested against third instar larvae (L3) of the Australian blowfly 
  <italic>Lucilia cuprina</italic>. We have determined the potential of the 
  <italic>T. minuta</italic> EO as a new biopesticide candidate. To test this, groups of 20 L3 were placed on filter paper impregnated with ranging concentrations (from 0.19 to 6.36 μL/cm
  <sup>2</sup>) of TMEO, solubilized in acetone. Data show in this article is related to research article “Tissue damage and cytotoxic effects of 
  <italic>Tagetes minuta</italic> essential oil against 
  <italic>Lucilia cuprina</italic>” Chaaban et al., 2019. Thus, data of cuticle damage, color changes in L3 body and decrease in L3 motility were recorded 24 and 48 h after TMEO contact.
