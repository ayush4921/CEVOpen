<p id="p0085">Data of establishment of stock colonies, maintenance, mass reproduction and the protocol for the biological tests are mentioned in the companion paper 
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The toxicity of 
 <italic>T. minuta</italic> over L3 of 
 <italic>L. cuprina</italic> was performed using groups of 20 L3, placed on filter paper and impregnated with a range of concentrations (0.19–6.36 μL/cm
 <sup>2</sup>). The L3 were put into glass vials containing a filter paper (12.56 cm
 <sup>2</sup>) impregnated with 0.2 mL of TMEO solutions, solubilized in acetone. The 
 <italic>T. minuta</italic> toxicity was evaluated by observing L3 mortality at 6, 24 and 48 h after contact 
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Total larval mortality (LM) was calculated 
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> as follows:
 <disp-formula id="ufd1">LM = (total died larvae x 100)/total tested larvae.</disp-formula>
