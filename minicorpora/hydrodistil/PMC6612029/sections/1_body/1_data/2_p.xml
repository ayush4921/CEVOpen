<p id="p0030">The data displayed in this data article involve the experimental data from the effects on cuticle damage of 
 <italic>Lucilia cuprina</italic> third instar larvae, treated with different concentrations of 
 <italic>Tagetes minuta</italic> essential oil 
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The larvae of the control group, using acetone as solvent, showed no cuticle alterations after 6, 24 or 48 h of contact (Video 1–3). The essential oil from 
 <italic>T. minuta</italic> showed no toxicity at 6 h of treatment (Video 4), however, a time-dependent mortality was demonstrated after 24 and 48 h of exposure. Morphologic changes in mature larvae, such as cuticle softening and dryness, color changes, as well as reduction of their motility were observed (Video 5–7).
