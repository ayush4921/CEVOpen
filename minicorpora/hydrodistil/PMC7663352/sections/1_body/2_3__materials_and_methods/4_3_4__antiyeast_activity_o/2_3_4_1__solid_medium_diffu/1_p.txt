0: A solid medium diffusion procedure using wells in dishes was used to determine the antiyeast activity of all EOs [ 22, 44].
1: For this, 1 mL of  S. cerevisiae suspension with a concentration of 10 6 CFU/mL was uniformly spread on a sterile MEA petri dish (diameter 9 cm).
2: After inoculum absorption by agar, wells were made using sterile glass tubes (diameter 6 mm) which were filled with 10 L of each EO.
3: The disc radius was not included.
4: Negative controls were prepared with only 10 L of DMSO.
5: Petri dishes were incubated at 28 C for 48 h; antiyeast activity was evaluated by measuring the diameter of the growth inhibition halos and was expressed in millimeters.
6: All determinations were carried out in triplicate.
