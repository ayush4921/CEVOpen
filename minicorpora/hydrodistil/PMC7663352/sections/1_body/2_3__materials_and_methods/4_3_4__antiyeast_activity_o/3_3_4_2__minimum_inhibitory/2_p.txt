0: The microplate bioassay was used to study the antiyeast activity of EOs.
1: The 24-well plates were prepared by dispensing into each well 1.8 mL of Malt Extract broth and 0.2 mL of yeast inoculum with a final concentration of 10 6 CFU/mL.
2: An aliquot (20 L) of each EO (with concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1000 L/mL) was transferred into a well.
3: Negative controls were prepared adding only 20 L of DMSO to ME medium.
4: The microplates were sealed and incubated on a plate shaker (100 rpm) at 28 C for 48 h. The yeast growth was evaluated by measuring the absorbance at 600 nm.
