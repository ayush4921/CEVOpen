0: Saccharomyces cerevisiae obtained from the strain collection of the Institute of Research on Terrestrial Ecosystems (IRET) of the National Research Council (CNR) was used to evaluate the antiyeast activity of EOs.
1: Stock culture was maintained at 4 C on Malt Extract Agar (malt extract 30 g/L; peptone 5 g/L; agar 15 g/L).
2: Inocula were obtained from overnight cultures on MEA plates at 28 C.  S. cerevisiae was grown in malt extract (ME 30 g/L; peptone 5 g/L) for 24 h in an orbital shaking incubator at 120 rpm at 28 C [ 59].
3: The growth was monitored both by measuring the absorbance at 600 nm and by counting on plates (CFU/mL).
