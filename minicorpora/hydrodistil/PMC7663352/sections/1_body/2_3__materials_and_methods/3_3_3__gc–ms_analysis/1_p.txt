0: Diluted EO samples (1:100  v/ v in heptane) were analyzed by gas-chromatographymass spectrometry (GCMS) using the Trace 1300 GC coupled to the TSQ DUO triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Walthan, MA, USA) equipped with an electron impact ion source.
1: Samples were injected without derivatization into the DB-5 column, 30-m length, 0.25-mm internal diameter, 0.25-m film (Thermo Scientific, Walthan, MA, USA) using the 1:10 split mode.
2: The following parameters were used: ionization energy of 70 eV, mass range between 50 and 550  m/z and interface temperature of 250 C. The GC oven temperature was as follows: initial oven temperature of 70 C and an isotherm for 1 min; subsequently, at 24 C/min to 180 C and an isotherm for 2 min, and then reached 280 C at 50 C/min where the isotherm was kept for a further 2 min.
3: The carrier gas was helium (He, purity 99.999%) with a constant flow of 1.2 mL/min.
