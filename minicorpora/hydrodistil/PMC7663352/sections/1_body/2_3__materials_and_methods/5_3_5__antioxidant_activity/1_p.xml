<p>The radical scavenging activity (RSA) of EOs was evaluated by 2,2′-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay according to the procedure of Blois [
 <xref rid="B61-molecules-25-05126" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Briefly, 150 μL of each EOs (with a concentration ranging from 0.1 to 1000 µL/mL) were mixed with 1.35 mL of 60-μM DPPH methanolic solution. The absorbance reduction at 517 nm of the DPPH was determined continuously for 60 min. The RSA was calculated as a percentage of DPPH discoloration, using the following equation:

 </disp-formula> where A
 <sub>S</sub> is the absorbance of the solution when the EO was added and A
 <sub>DPPH</sub> is the absorbance of the DPPH solution, as reported [
 <xref rid="B62-molecules-25-05126" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. The extract concentration (EC) necessary to achieve 50% radical DPPH inhibition (EC
 <sub>50</sub>) was obtained by plotting the RSA percentage as a function of EOs’ concentrations and was expressed as microliters per milliliter (µL/mL).
