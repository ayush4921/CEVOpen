0: The radical scavenging activity (RSA) of EOs was evaluated by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay according to the procedure of Blois [ 61].
1: Briefly, 150 L of each EOs (with a concentration ranging from 0.1 to 1000 L/mL) were mixed with 1.35 mL of 60-M DPPH methanolic solution.
2: The absorbance reduction at 517 nm of the DPPH was determined continuously for 60 min.
3: The RSA was calculated as a percentage of DPPH discoloration, using the following equation: (1)%RSA= (ADPPH  As)ADPPH 100 where A S is the absorbance of the solution when the EO was added and A DPPH is the absorbance of the DPPH solution, as reported [ 62].
4: The extract concentration (EC) necessary to achieve 50% radical DPPH inhibition (EC 50) was obtained by plotting the RSA percentage as a function of EOs concentrations and was expressed as microliters per milliliter (L/mL).
