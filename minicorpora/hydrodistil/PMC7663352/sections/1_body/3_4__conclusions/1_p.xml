<p>From analyzing the chemical composition of the 14 EOs, bitter orange was found to consist mainly of monoterpenes while tea tree, eucalyptus, lavender, palmarosa, Chinese yin yang, and Japanese yin yang were characterized by high amounts of monoterpenoids and oxygenated monoterpenes. Sesquiterpenes, on the other hand, were abundant in ylang ylang, while star anise, fennel, clove, and oregano were rich in phenylpropanoids. Turmeric and pepper EOs exhibited a more heterogeneous chemoprofile and could not be associated with a prevalent terpenic class.</p>
