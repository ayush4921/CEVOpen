<p>Aromatic plants (APs) have been used since antiquity in folk medicine and as food preservatives due to their many biologically active components including phenolic compounds (e.g., phenolic acids, flavonoids, coumarins, lignans, stilbenes, and tannins), nitrogen-containing compounds (alkaloids, amines, and betalains) and terpenoids (including carotenoids). Essential oils (EOs) are the volatile fractions extracted from aromatic plants. EOs are highly complex natural mixtures of low-molecular mass volatile compounds such as terpenes and aldehydes that are responsible for the typical aroma of any APs [

In nature, EOs play important biological and ecological roles since they are directly involved in plant communication and thus are considered as the language of chemical signaling [

EOs have widely been used for centuries for their well-known virucidal, antibacterial, antifungal, anticancer, antioxidant, and antidiabetic activities in medicinal and pharmaceutical formulations, in perfumery, fragrance, and cosmetic industries, in aromatherapy and as food additives [
