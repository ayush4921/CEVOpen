<p>Fresh and stored food, such as raw olive, dairy products (cheeses and yogurts), fruits and products (jams, canned fruits, dried fruits, glac√©d fruits, and fruit salads), bakery products, alcoholic (wine and beer) and non-alcoholic (juice and soft drinks) beverages can undergo microbial contamination [

 <xref rid="B2-molecules-25-05126" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In order to ensure the quality and safety of food products and thus to protect consumer health, effective antimicrobial and antioxidant measures are necessary. Heat treatment, pasteurization, and antiseptic packaging are the most used methods to avoid microbiological deterioration of fruit and vegetable juices and purees and to exclude spoilage as long as the packaging remains intact [

 <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> is widely found in the industrial fermentation of foods and beverages containing mono- and disaccharides. Common cases of food spoilage by yeast are reported in fresh sea food, packed meat, fresh and frozen vegetables, wines and dairy products. Foods and drinks that cannot be pasteurized are usually treated with preservatives to prevent the growth of mold, yeast and fungi. Primarily used chemical preservatives are weak acids, such as sorbic and benzoic acid, and their salts or sulfites. Recent studies, however, raise concerns about the use of some chemical preservatives such as benzoic acid that can degrade to benzene, a carcinogen substance when used in foods [

However, most of the fungicides as well as their degradation products can contaminate the foodstuff and thus their use is an issue for food safety.
