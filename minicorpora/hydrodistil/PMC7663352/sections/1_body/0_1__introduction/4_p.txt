0: In general, EOs display their antiyeast, antimold and antifungal activities by means of irreversible damages affecting the membrane permeability and osmotic balance of the cell.
1: Furthermore, they were reported to be able to modify ion transport processes and interact with vital cellular constituents including membrane proteins, resulting in water imbalance, depletion of intracellular ATP concentration and finally causing cell death [ 2, 18, 19, 20].
2: Furthermore, EOs possess antioxidant activity capable of counteracting the action of free radical-mediated lipid peroxidation with the resulting decrease in shelf stability of foodstuffs [ 21, 22, 23, 24].
3: Most prominently, terpenes, terpenoids and phenylpropanoids, having lipophilic nature and showing remarkable antimicrobial activity, are the main active ingredient of EOs.
