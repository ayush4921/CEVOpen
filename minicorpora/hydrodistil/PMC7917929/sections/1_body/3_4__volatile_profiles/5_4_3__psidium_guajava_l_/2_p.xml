<p>Fifty-three records of 
 <italic>Psidium guajava</italic> essential oils were arranged in 28 profiles based on the chemical skeleton of their main compounds. The profile I was characterized by sesquiterpenes with caryophyllane, acyclic and aromadendrene types. Primary compounds were 
 <italic>E</italic>-caryophyllene (15.8–24.6%), 
 <italic>E</italic>-nerolidol (7.7–35.6%), caryophyllene oxide (5.1%), (2
 <italic>Z</italic>,6
 <italic>E</italic>)-farnesol (6.7%), and ledol (5.5%) of oil records from Asia (Pakistan) and Europe (France) [

 <xref rid="B51-molecules-26-00965" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Profile II corresponded to a record oil from Cuba, rich in the sesquiterpenes of caryophyllane, acyclic, cadinane and aromadendrene types: 
 <italic>E</italic>-caryophyllene (21.6%), 
 <italic>E</italic>-nerolidol (l9.2%), selin-11-en-4α-ol (13.4%), viridiflorene (8.8%), α-selinene (8.3%), caryophyllene oxide (8.2%), and cedr-8(15)-en-9α-ol (7.9%) [
 <xref rid="B52-molecules-26-00965" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The profile III displayed compounds with caryophyllane and aromadendrene skeletons, as 
 <italic>E</italic>-caryophyllene (24.4–36.4%) and γ-gurjunene (12.7–14.0%) corresponding to three oil records from China [
 <xref rid="B53-molecules-26-00965" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], and another from Tunisia, which was characterized by viridiflorol (36.4%) and 
 <italic>E</italic>-caryophyllene (5.9%) [
 <xref rid="B54-molecules-26-00965" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].
