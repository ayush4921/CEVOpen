<p>Profiles XX–XXV and XXVII–XXVIII were registered to only one 
 <italic>P. guajava</italic> sample from different locations. Profile XX from Mauritius was characterized by bisabolane (santalol 50.6%), caryophyllane (caryophyllene oxide 15.4%), 
 <italic>p</italic>-menthane (limonene (11.6%), and cadinane (cycloisosativene, 6.1%) skeleton types [

 <italic>E</italic>-hexenal (28.4%) and benzaldehyde (16.5%), followed by the sesquiterpene types 
 <italic>p</italic>-menthane (1,8-cineole 15.9%), aromadendrene (globulol 10.3%), and acyclic (
 <italic>E</italic>-nerolidol 6.9%) [

 <italic>E</italic>-hexenal (7.4%) [
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-26-00965" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The fruits volatile concentrate from Cuba, obtained by simultaneous distillation-extraction (SDE), was classified as profile XXIII, rich in a mixture of other classes of constituents, with 3
 <italic>Z</italic>-hexenyl acetate (5.0%) as the major compound [

 <italic>E</italic>-γ-bisabolene (5.3%), and α-curcumene (5.1%), followed by 
 <italic>E</italic>-caryophyllene (6.0%) [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-26-00965" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Profile XXV of fruits concentrate from Cuba showed 
 <italic>E</italic>-cinnamyl acetate (5.6%) as the most significant constituent [
 <xref rid="B61-molecules-26-00965" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Profile XXVII from Pakistan was rich in hexanol (13.9%), cinnamyl alcohol (10.9%), butanol (10.7%), 3-methyl glutaric anhydride (9.5%), hexene (7.7%), butanoic acid methyl ester (7.2%), and 3-hexenal (6.6%) [
