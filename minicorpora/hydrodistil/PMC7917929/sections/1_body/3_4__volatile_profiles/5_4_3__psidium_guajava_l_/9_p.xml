<p>Profile XXVI was composed of leaves oils from 22 genotypes of 
 <italic>P. guajava</italic> grown in Espírito Santo state, Brazil, at two different environments and showed a great chemical diversity. The main constituents were sesquiterpenes with acyclic, caryophyllane, bisabolane, cadinane, germacrene, and aromadendrene skeletons, followed by 
 <italic>p</italic>-menthane monoterpene constituents. Oil samples from the city of Mimoso do Sul displayed 
 <italic>E</italic>-caryophyllene (5.1–30.0%), α-humulene (2.0–24.4%), 14-hydroxy-
 <italic>epi</italic>-
