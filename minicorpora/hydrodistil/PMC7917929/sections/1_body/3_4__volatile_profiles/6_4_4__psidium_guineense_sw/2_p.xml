<p>Eighteen accessions of leaves (16 records) and fruits (2 records) oils of 
 <italic>P. guineense</italic> were classified in 16 chemical profiles, according to the major constituents (&gt;5%), corresponding to monoterpenes with 
 <italic>p</italic>-menthane and pinane skeletons, followed by sesquiterpenes with acyclic, bisabolane, germacrane, elemane, caryophyllane, and cadinane skeletons. Profiles I–V, VII–IX, and XI–XIII occur in Northern Brazil, profile VI in Northeast Brazil, profile X in Mexico, profile XIV in South Brazil, all of them from leaves, and profiles XV and XVI from fruits occur in Colombia. Profile I was dominated by limonene (47.4%) [
