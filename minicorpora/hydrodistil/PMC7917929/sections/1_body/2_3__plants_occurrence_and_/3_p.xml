<p>To find the most widespread subjects of 
 <italic>Psidium</italic> essential oils and identify their relationships, we analyzed the co-occurrence of similar terms in titles and abstracts of 158 articles in the Scopus database from 1990 to 2020. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00965-f003">Figure 3</xref> represents this survey and its associations. The size of the node indicates the extent of searches for the term. That is, the larger the node, the more frequently the term was searched. The search terms are grouped according to their similarity. Thus, the blue cluster includes terms related to in vivo tests, such as “rat”, “animal experiment”, “in humans”, and others. The red cluster contains terms related to biological activities, such as “enzyme activity”, “in vitro study”, “antimicrobial activity”, and “median inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>)”. The green cluster shows terms related to chemical composition, such as “essential oil composition”, “chemical analysis”, “hydrodistillation”, “gas chromatography”, “cineole”, “limonene”, etc. Finally, in yellow and to a lesser extent, one can observe a cluster four with terms related to this article’s theme.
