 <italic>Psidium pohlianum</italic> O. Berg (syn. 
 <italic>Psidium salutare</italic> var. 
 <italic>pohlianum</italic> (O. Berg) Landrum), rich in β-eudesmol (27.1%), 1,8-cineole (24.7%), α-elemol (11.8%), α-pinene (11.4%), guaiol (9.1%), and β-pinene (8.4%), showed an antinociceptive effect in mice, causing a reduction in nociception induced by formalin of 25% (dose of 100 mg/kg), 45% (dose of 200 mg/kg), and 84% (dose of 400 mg/kg), respectively. In the hot plate test, this oil increased the reaction times by 30 min (200 mg/kg) and 60 min (400 mg/kg), respectively. In the tail compression and locomotion tests, positive results were also observed [

 <italic>Psidium brownianum</italic> Mart. ex DC., rich in β-eudesmol (27.1%), 1,8-cineole (24.7%), α-elemol (11.8%), α-pinene (11.4%), guaiol (9.1%), and β-pinene (8.4%), the antinociceptive effect has also been observed in the acute nociception model, induced by acetic acid at 100 and 200 mg/kg doses, where the number of abdominal contortions was reduced by 41.79%. This oil reduced paw licking time in both phases, in formalin-induced abdominal contortions, by 80.47% (100 mg/kg) and 87.59% (200 mg/kg), respectively. In the hot plate test, at a concentration of 100 and 200 mg/kg, the oil prolonged the mice’s reaction time (30 min, 68.54, and 76.16%; 60 min, 105.47, and 106.52%; 90 min, 105.57, and 96.58%, respectively). In capsaicin-induced nociception, the oil reduced the animals’ paw licking time by 45.36% and 42.26% (doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg, orally administered) after capsaicin (20 μL/paw) administration [
