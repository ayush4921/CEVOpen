 <italic>Psidium guajava</italic> essential oil has been extensively investigated for its antioxidant potential, using different methods. The leaves oil from central region of Mauritius, dominated by caryophyllene oxide (15.4%) and limonene (11.6%), displayed antioxidant activity against DPPH (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 5.19 µg/mL), ABTS (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 3.09 µg/mL), XO (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 2.51 µg/mL), OH (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 1.90 µg/mL), NO (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 2.71 µg/mL), ORAC (0.27 gTE/gEO), and FRAP (44.41 µmol Fe
 <sup>+2</sup>/mg OE) methods [

 <italic>Psidium guajava</italic> essential oils from different China regions were evaluated by DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP methods. Three oil records rich in oxygenated sesquiterpenes (17.4–18.7%) from Guangdong province showed the highest antioxidant potential on DPPH (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 18.5–20.3 mg/mL), ABTS (13.1–16.2 mg/mL) and FRAP assays (7.3–9.1 mmol Vc/g DM). On the other hand, the samples from other regions were less active on DPPH (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 20.4–33.7 mg/mL) and ABTS (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 18.3–25.3 mg/mL) methods [

 <italic>Psidium guajava</italic> leaves (
 <italic>E</italic>-caryophyllene 16.9%, selin-7(11)-en-4-α-ol 8.3%, and α-selinene 6.5%) and fruits (
 <italic>E</italic>-caryophyllene 17.6%, limonene 11.0%, and α-selinene, 6.6%) oils from Egypt displayed antioxidant activity on DPPH (leaves oil, IC
 <sub>50</sub> 3,59 mg/mL; fruits oil, IC
 <sub>50</sub> 8,11 mg/mL), and deoxyribose assay (leaves oil, IC
 <sub>50</sub> 12,64 μg/mL; fruits oil, IC
 <sub>50</sub> 42,78 μg/mL). This antioxidant effect may result from the high content of oxygenated mono- and sesquiterpenes in both oils [
