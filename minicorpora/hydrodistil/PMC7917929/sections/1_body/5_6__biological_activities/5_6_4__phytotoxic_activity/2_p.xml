<p>Leaf essential oils of four 
 <italic>Psidium</italic> species from Espírito Santo state, Southeast Brazil, were evaluated against 
 <italic>Lactuca sativa</italic> L. and 
 <italic>Sorghum bicolor</italic> (L.) Moench. Germination inhibition and germination speed index were the analyzed parameters. 
 <italic>Psidium cattleyanum</italic> oil, rich in 
 <italic>E</italic>-caryophyllene (23.4%), caryophyllene oxide (11.5%), and α-pinene (11.3%), at a concentration of 3000 µg/mL, caused germination inhibition against 
 <italic>L. sativa</italic> (74.6%) and 
 <italic>S. bicolor</italic> (92.6%), with a germination speed index of 3.4 mm and 6.9 mm, respectively. 
 <italic>Psidium friedrichsthalianum</italic> oil dominated by 
 <italic>E</italic>-caryophyllene (24.6%), caryophyllene oxide (10.6%), α-humulene (9.2%), and α-copaene (5.9%), at a concentration of 375 µg/mL, inhibited the germination of 
 <italic>L. sativa</italic> (92.8%) and 
 <italic>S. bicolor</italic> (91.7%), with a germination speed index of 5.7 mm and 8.4 mm, respectively. 
 <italic>Psidium gaudichaudianum</italic>, rich in 
 <italic>E</italic>-caryophyllene (17.0%), limonene (16.2%), α-pinene (8.4%), caryophyllene oxide (7.5%), and α-humulene (5.8%), at a concentration of 1500 µg/mL, caused a germination inhibition of 
 <italic>L. sativa</italic> (90.7%) and 
 <italic>S. bicolor</italic> (91.1%), with a germination speed index of 5.2 mm and 8.1 mm, respectively. Also, 
 <italic>P. myrtoides</italic> oil, composed primarily of 
 <italic>E</italic>-caryophyllene (19.4%), α-bisabolol (10.4%), α-humulene (10.4%), α-copaene (6.3%), and caryophyllene oxide (5.3%), at a concentration of 3000 µg/mL, inhibited the germination of 
 <italic>L. sativa</italic> and 
 <italic>S. bicolor</italic> in 47.4% and 90.4%, at a germination speed index of 3.4 mm and 7.8 mm, respectively [
