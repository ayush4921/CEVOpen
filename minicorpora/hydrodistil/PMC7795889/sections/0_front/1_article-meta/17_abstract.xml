  <italic>Rhynchanthus beesianus</italic> W. W. Smith, an edible, medicinal, and ornamental plant, is mainly cultivated in China and Myanmar. The essential oil (EO) from 
  <italic>R. beesianus</italic> rhizome has been used as an aromatic stomachic in China. The chemical composition and biological activities of EO from 
  <italic>R. beesianus</italic> rhizome were reported for the first time. Based on gas chromatography with flame ionization or mass selective detection (GC-FID/MS) results, the major constituents of EO were 1,8-cineole (47.6%), borneol (15.0%), methyleugenol (11.2%), and bornyl formate (7.6%). For bioactivities, EO showed a significant antibacterial activity against 
  <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
  <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic>, 
  <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, 
  <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
  <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, and 
  <italic>Proteus vulgaris</italic> with the diameter of the inhibition zone (DIZ) (8.66–10.56 mm), minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) (3.13–6.25 mg/mL), and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) (6.25–12.5 mg/mL). Moreover, EO (128 μg/mL) significantly inhibited the production of proinflammatory mediators nitric oxide (NO) (92.73 ± 1.50%) and cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (20.29 ± 0.17%) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) (61.08 ± 0.13%) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW264.7 macrophages without any cytotoxic effect. Moreover, EO exhibited significant acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity (the concentration of the sample that affords a 50% inhibition in the assay (IC
  <sub>50</sub>) = 1.03 ± 0.18 mg/mL) and moderate α-glucosidase inhibition effect (IC
  <sub>50</sub> = 11.60 ± 0.25 mg/mL). Thus, the EO could be regarded as a bioactive natural product and has a high exploitation potential in the cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries.
