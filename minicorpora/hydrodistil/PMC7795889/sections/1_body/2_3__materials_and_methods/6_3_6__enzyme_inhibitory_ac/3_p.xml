<p>The inhibitory effects of cholinesterase including acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) were assayed according to Ellman’s method with marginal modification [
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-26-00167" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. EO solution (50 μL) was mixed with AChE or BuChE solution (10 μL, 0.5 U/mL) in a 96-well plate and incubated at 4 °C for 10 min. Subsequently, acetylthiocholine iodide (ATCI) or butyrylthiocholine chloride (BTCl) solution (20 μL, 2 mM) and 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) solution (20 μL, pH 8.0, 2 mM) were added and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. After that, the absorbance was read at 405 nm and galanthamine was used as a positive control. The cholinesterase inhibitory effects were expressed using IC
 <sub>50</sub> values.
