0: The inhibitory activity of tyrosinase was evaluated according to the method with L-tyrosine as a substrate [ 49].
1: EO solution (70 L) and tyrosinase solution (100 L, 100 U/mL) were mixed and added to each well.
2: After 5 min incubation at 37 C, 80 L of L-tyrosine solution (5.5 mM) was added and incubated at 37 C for 30 min.
3: Then, the absorbance was recorded at 492 nm and arbutin was used as a positive control.
4: The tyrosinase inhibitory activity was expressed using IC 50 values.
