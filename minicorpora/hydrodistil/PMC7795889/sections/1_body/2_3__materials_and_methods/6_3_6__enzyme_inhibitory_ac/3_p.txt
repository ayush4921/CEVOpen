0: The inhibitory effects of cholinesterase including acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) were assayed according to Ellmans method with marginal modification [ 50].
1: EO solution (50 L) was mixed with AChE or BuChE solution (10 L, 0.5 U/mL) in a 96-well plate and incubated at 4 C for 10 min.
2: Subsequently, acetylthiocholine iodide (ATCI) or butyrylthiocholine chloride (BTCl) solution (20 L, 2 mM) and 5,5-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) solution (20 L, pH 8.0, 2 mM) were added and incubated at 37 C for 30 min.
3: After that, the absorbance was read at 405 nm and galanthamine was used as a positive control.
4: The cholinesterase inhibitory effects were expressed using IC 50 values.
