<p>The α-glucosidase inhibitory activity was assayed according to the method previously described with slight modification [
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-26-00167" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. EO solution (30 μL), phosphate buffer (60 μL, pH 6.8), and α-glucosidase solution (10 μL, 0.8 U/mL) were mixed in a 96-well plate and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Then, p-Nitrophenyl-α-D-glucopyranoside (p-NPG) solution (10 μL, 1 mM) was added and incubated at 37 °C. After 15 min, the reaction was stopped by adding Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> solution (80 μL, 0.2 M), and finally the absorbance was measured at 405 nm. Acarbose was used as a positive reference. The α-glucosidase inhibitory effect was expressed using IC
 <sub>50</sub> values.
