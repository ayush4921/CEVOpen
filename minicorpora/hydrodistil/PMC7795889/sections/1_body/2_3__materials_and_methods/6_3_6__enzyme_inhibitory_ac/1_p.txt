0: The -glucosidase inhibitory activity was assayed according to the method previously described with slight modification [ 48].
1: EO solution (30 L), phosphate buffer (60 L, pH 6.8), and -glucosidase solution (10 L, 0.8 U/mL) were mixed in a 96-well plate and incubated at 37 C for 15 min.
2: Then, p-Nitrophenyl--D-glucopyranoside (p-NPG) solution (10 L, 1 mM) was added and incubated at 37 C. After 15 min, the reaction was stopped by adding Na 2CO 3 solution (80 L, 0.2 M), and finally the absorbance was measured at 405 nm.
3: Acarbose was used as a positive reference.
4: The -glucosidase inhibitory effect was expressed using IC 50 values.
