<p>The EO was analyzed by an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID). Capillary column: HP-5MS (60 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm film thickness). The injection volume was 1 μL and split injection was used (split ratio 1:20). The flow rate of carrier gas helium was set at 1 mL/min. The following GC oven temperature was used: kept at 70 °C (2 min), 2 °C per min to 180 °C (55 min), 10 °C per min to 310 °C (13 min), and held at 310 °C (4 min). The GC-MS analysis was carried out using an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph equipped with an Agilent 5975C mass selective detector (Agilent Technologies Inc., CA, USA). GC column and parameters were the same as in GC-FID. The mass spectra operated in the mass range (
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 29 to 500) and EI mode (70 eV). The interface temperature and ion source temperature were 280 °C and 230 °C, respectively. The relative percentage of chemical constituents was determined by the peak area. The retention index (RI) was determined by referring to a series of n-alkanes (C
 <sub>8</sub>–C
 <sub>21</sub>). The constituents of the EO were identified by comparison of their retention index and mass spectrum with those listed in NIST 2017 and Wiley 275 databases.
