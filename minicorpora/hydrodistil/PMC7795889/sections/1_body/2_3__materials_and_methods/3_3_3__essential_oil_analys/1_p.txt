0: The EO was analyzed by an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID).
1: Capillary column: HP-5MS (60 m  0.25 mm, 0.25 m film thickness).
2: The injection volume was 1 L and split injection was used (split ratio 1:20).
3: The flow rate of carrier gas helium was set at 1 mL/min.
4: The following GC oven temperature was used: kept at 70 C (2 min), 2 C per min to 180 C (55 min), 10 C per min to 310 C (13 min), and held at 310 C (4 min).
5: The GC-MS analysis was carried out using an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph equipped with an Agilent 5975C mass selective detector (Agilent Technologies Inc., CA, USA).
6: GC column and parameters were the same as in GC-FID.
7: The mass spectra operated in the mass range ( m/ z 29 to 500) and EI mode (70 eV).
8: The interface temperature and ion source temperature were 280 C and 230 C, respectively.
9: The relative percentage of chemical constituents was determined by the peak area.
10: The retention index (RI) was determined by referring to a series of n-alkanes (C 8C 21).
11: The constituents of the EO were identified by comparison of their retention index and mass spectrum with those listed in NIST 2017 and Wiley 275 databases.
