0: The diameter of the inhibition zone (DIZ) was assayed according to our previously published disc agar diffusion method [ 46].
1: Briefly, The EO was dissolved with ethyl acetate (100 mg/mL).
2: Streptomycin distilled water solution (100 g/mL) was used as a positive control.
3: The bacterial suspension (100 L, 10 6 CFU/mL) was evenly spread on the MuellerHinton agar medium.
4: The filter paper discs (diameter 6 mm) containing EO or streptomycin solution (20 L) were added and the diameter of inhibition zone (DIZ) was recorded after 24 h incubation at 37 C.
