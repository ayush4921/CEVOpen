0: The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) values were evaluated by the microplate dilution method [ 46].
1: Briefly, the two-fold serially diluted sample solution (100 L) and the bacterial suspensions (100 L) were added to each well at the final density of 10 5 CFU/mL.
2: The 96-well plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 C. Then, 20 L of resazurin solution (0.1 mg/mL) was added to each well and incubated for 2 h in the dark at 37 C. The MIC was determined as the minimum sample concentration without color change.
3: For the determination of MBC value, the sample (10 L) from the wells without color change was subcultured in a MuellerHinton agar plate for 24 h at 37 C. MBC was defined as the minimum sample concentration without bacterial growth.
