0: The RAW264.7 cell suspensions (100 L) were added to each well at the density of 2  10 4 cells per well and allowed to grow for 24 h. After removing the medium, the cells were incubated with 100 L of two-fold serially diluted EO solution for 2 h. Then, 100L lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was added to the final concentration of 1 g/mL and incubated for another 24 h. Morphological changes of the treated RAW264.7 cells were recorded using an inverted microscope (Leica DMi8, Leica Microsystems, Germany).
1: Subsequently, the supernatants were collected and centrifuged.
2: The accumulation amount of NO in the supernatant was detected using a colorimetric NO detection kit following the manufacturers instructions (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China).
3: The secretion of IL-6 and TNF- was determined using respective ELISA determination kits according to the manufacturers instructions (Multi Sciences Biotech Co., Ltd., Hangzhou, China).
4: Dexamethasone (DXM) (20 g/mL) was used as a positive control.
