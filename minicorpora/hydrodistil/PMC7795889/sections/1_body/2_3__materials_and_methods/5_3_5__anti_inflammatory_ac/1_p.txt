0: Murine macrophages RAW264.7 and murine fibroblast cells L929 were maintained at 37 C with 5% CO 2 atmosphere in Dulbeccos modified eagle medium (DMEM) and Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium, respectively.
1: Both media were supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 g/mL streptomycin.
2: The cytotoxic activity was determined by the MTT assay with slight modification [ 47].
3: The cell suspensions (100 L) were added to each well at the density of 2  10 4 cells per well and incubated for 24 h. Subsequently, 100 L of the diluted EO solution was added and cultured for 24 h. Then, the MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) solution (10 L, 5 mg/mL in PBS) was added.
4: After 4 h of incubation, the supernate was discarded and 150 L of DMSO was added to each well to dissolve formazan crystal.
5: The absorbance was measured using a Varioskan Lux Multimode microplate reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) at 490 nm to evaluate the cell viability and proliferation inhibitory ratio.
