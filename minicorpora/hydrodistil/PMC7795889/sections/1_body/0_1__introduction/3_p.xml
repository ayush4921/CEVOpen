 <italic>Rhynchanthus beesianus</italic> W. W. Smith, a perennial herb with tuberous rhizomes is cultivated as an edible, medicinal, and ornamental plant in Myanmar and Southern China [

 <xref rid="B15-molecules-26-00167" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The rhizomes and tender leaves of 
 <italic>R. beesianus</italic> are used as edible spices and vegetables in Yunnan Province, China. Its flower shape is peculiar, like a colorful and gorgeous brush, which can be used as fresh cut flowers or used for hanging cultivation. The rhizome has been used in Chinese folk medicine and as an aromatic stomachic, commonly known as 
 <italic>diangaoliangjiang</italic>, to treat stomachache, backache, and indigestion [

 <italic>R. beesianus</italic>, which could impede its exploitation in the industry. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to study the chemical composition of the essential oil from 
 <italic>R. beesianus</italic> rhizome and evaluate its antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and enzyme inhibitory activities.
