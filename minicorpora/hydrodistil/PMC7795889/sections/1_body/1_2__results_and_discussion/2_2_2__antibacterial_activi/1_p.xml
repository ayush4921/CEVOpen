<p>The antibacterial activity of EO was qualitatively evaluated by the diameter of inhibition zone (DIZ) and quantitatively determined by the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) values using streptomycin as the positive control (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00167-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The EO revealed broad-spectrum antibacterial activity with DIZ values ranging from 8.66 to 10.56 mm against Staphylococcus aureus (MIC = 6.25 mg/mL, MBC = 6.25 mg/mL), Enterococcus faecalis (MIC = 6.25 mg/mL, MBC = 6.25 mg/mL), Bacillus subtilis (MIC = 3.13 mg/mL, MBC = 6.25 mg/mL), Escherichia coli (MIC = 6.25 mg/mL, MBC = 12.50 mg/mL), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC = 6.25 mg/mL, MBC = 12.50 mg/mL), Proteus vulgaris (MIC = 3.13 mg/mL, MBC = 6.25 mg/mL). The 1,8-cineole, as the most predominant component of R. beesianus EO, has been demonstrated to have significant antibacterial activity [

 <xref rid="B20-molecules-26-00167" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Recent studies have shown that borneol has an effective broad-spectrum antibacterial capability against Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria, and even multi-drug resistant bacteria via membrane disruption mechanism [

According to the study of Donadu et al., EO rich in 1,8-cineole and α-pinene showed significant antibacterial against Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimum lethal concentration (MLC) values from 2 to 4% (

 <xref rid="B26-molecules-26-00167" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Therefore, the significant antibacterial property of R. beesianus EO can be attributed to these main components, and it can provide the natural antibacterial agents for the cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries.
