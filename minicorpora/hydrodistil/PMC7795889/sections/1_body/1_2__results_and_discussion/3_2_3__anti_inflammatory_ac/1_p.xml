<p>The anti-inflammatory activity of the EO from 
 <italic>R. beesianus</italic> rhizome was investigated against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation in RAW264.7 macrophages. The cytotoxicity of 
 <italic>R. beesianus</italic> EO on L929 and RAW264.7 cells were evaluated using 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Compared with the untreated control cells, 
 <italic>R. beesianus</italic> EO showed no significant cytotoxicity on L929 and RAW264.7 cells at 16−128 μg/mL (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00167-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Therefore, subsequent experiments were performed using EO concentrations of 16−128 μg/mL. Compared with the control group, RAW264.7 cells induced by LPS increased in size and became irregular in shape. RAW264.7 cells in the EO-treated group showed a relatively smooth surface compared to those in the LPS-induced group (

The accumulation of proinflammatory mediator nitric oxide (NO) in the culture supernatants were assayed by the Griess reaction using a colorimetric NO detection kit. Dexamethasone (DXM, 20 μg/mL) was used as a positive control. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00167-f003">Figure 3</xref>B, compared with the control (1.46 ± 0.19 μM), stimulation with LPS alone resulted in a more than 13-fold increase in NO production (19.44 ± 1.88 μM). EO inhibited the production of NO in a dose-dependent manner. In particular, pretreatment with 128 μg/mL EO significantly decreased NO production by 92.73 ± 1.50% (2.84 ± 0.31 μM), which was equivalent to that of the positive control DXM (92.56 ± 0.70%, 2.80 ± 0.19 μM). Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) are two important pro-inflammatory cytokines, which play a key role in inflammatory disorders [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-26-00167" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The levels of TNF-α and IL-6 in the culture supernatant were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assay using an ELISA determination kit. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00167-f003">Figure 3</xref>C, compared with the LPS group (3050.07 ± 4.04 pg/mL), EO significantly inhibited the secretion of TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophages at doses of 64 μg/mL (2731.02 ± 1.80 pg/mL) and 128 μg/mL (2451.02 ± 3.52 pg/mL). The maximum inhibition rate of EO (20.29 ± 0.17% at 128 μg/mL) was comparable to that of DXM (21.34 ± 0.20% at 20 μg/mL). Additionally, compared with the LPS group (974.28 ± 4.15 pg/mL), EO effectively inhibited the secretion of IL-6 in RAW264.7 cells induced by LPS at doses of 16 μg/mL (803.81 ± 28.82 pg/mL), 32 μg/mL (738.81 ± 5.87 pg/mL), 64 μg/mL (550.48 ± 8.30 pg/mL), and 128 μg/mL (379.17 ± 0.31 pg/mL). In particular, the inhibitory ratios of EO at 64 μg/mL (43.50 ± 1.09%) and 128 μg/mL (61.08 ± 0.13%) were exceeded that of DXM (21.90 ± 0.14% at 20 μg/mL) (
