<p>The inhibition of cholinesterase can reduce the decomposition of acetylcholine to enhance cholinergic neurotransmission, which has become an effective treatment strategy for Alzheimer’s disease [

 <sub>50</sub> value of 1.03 ± 0.18 mg/mL. However, EO showed a weak inhibitory effect on BChE (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 104.22 ± 11.61 mg/mL). According to the previous studies, 1,8-cineole and 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene showed a strong AChE inhibitory activity and were found to be uncompetitive reversible AChE inhibitors [

 <italic>α</italic>-terpineol has been demonstrated in the previous studies [
