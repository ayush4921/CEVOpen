<p>α-Glucosidase inhibitors, such as acarbose, have been used to treat type 2 diabetes by reducing post-meal blood glucose and insulin levels [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-26-00167" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Pre-diabetes is the preceding condition of diabetes and can lead to the development of diabetes in most cases. The treatment of pre-diabetes has shown great success in preventing the further progression of diabetes [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-26-00167" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The lower doses of acarbose have been shown to have beneficial effects on pre-diabetes by delaying the absorption of carbohydrates in the intestine, but its use is limited by its side effects, such as flatulence, diarrhea, and abdominal distension [

Hence, it is very promising to screen natural products that prevent pre-diabetic from developing into type 2 diabetes by inhibiting the activity of α-glucosidase to reduce glucose absorption. EO exhibited moderate α-glucosidase inhibition effect (the concentration of the sample that affords a 50% inhibition in the assay (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 11.60 ± 0.25 mg/mL). The inhibitory activities of 1,8-cineole and methyleugenol against α-glucosidase were reported in the previous studies [
