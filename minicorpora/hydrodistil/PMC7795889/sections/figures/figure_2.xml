  <p>The effect of 
   <italic>R. beesianus</italic> rhizome EO on the cell viability of RAW264.7 (murine macrophage cells) and L929 (murine fibroblast cells). L929 and RAW264.7 cells were pre-treated with different concentrations of 
   <italic>R. beesianus</italic> EO for 24 h, and the cell viability was assayed by 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The results were expressed as the percentage (%) of viable cells compared to the untreated cells and showed the mean Â± standard deviation (SD). * 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, compared to the control group.
