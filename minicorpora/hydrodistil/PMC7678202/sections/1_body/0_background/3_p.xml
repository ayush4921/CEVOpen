<p id="Par14">Modulation of DCs with plant-derived natural products was documented in several scientific articles. Generally, the plant and their constituents may enhance the differentiation of DCs from precursors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], or modulate DC functions to either induce or suppress immune responses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. To achieve such modulation, DC undergoes several phenotypical and functional changes. For instance, changes lead to up or downregulation of DC maturation markers including CD80, CD86, CD83, CD40, and HLA-DR, phagocytic activity, cytokine production, and the ability to activate CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells. For Example, 
 <italic>Vigna angularis</italic> (an extract from Azuki bean), pinecone extract, and 
 <italic>Mucuna pruviens</italic> var. exhibited differentiation and maturation of DCs in vitro [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Studies demonstrated that changes in the functional status of DCs may bind to pattern recognition receptors, therefore could be useful targets for infectious disease therapy. Accordingly, it has been reported that both soybean and peanut agglutinin were agonists for TLR4 in humans [
