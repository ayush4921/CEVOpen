0: Modulation of DCs with plant-derived natural products was documented in several scientific articles.
1: Generally, the plant and their constituents may enhance the differentiation of DCs from precursors [ 9], or modulate DC functions to either induce or suppress immune responses [ 10,  11].
2: To achieve such modulation, DC undergoes several phenotypical and functional changes.
3: For instance, changes lead to up or downregulation of DC maturation markers including CD80, CD86, CD83, CD40, and HLA-DR, phagocytic activity, cytokine production, and the ability to activate CD4 + T cells.
4: For Example,  Vigna angularis (an extract from Azuki bean), pinecone extract, and  Mucuna pruviens var.
5: exhibited differentiation and maturation of DCs in vitro [ 9,  12,  13].
6: Studies demonstrated that changes in the functional status of DCs may bind to pattern recognition receptors, therefore could be useful targets for infectious disease therapy.
7: Accordingly, it has been reported that both soybean and peanut agglutinin were agonists for TLR4 in humans [ 14].
