0: Dendritic cells (DCs) are one of the three mononuclear phagocyte system known for their exclusive characteristics [ 5].
1: DCs contain distinct subpopulations critically essential for the generation of multiple functions in the immune system, which determine the outcome of immune responses.
2: Immature DCs (imDCs) are located in the peripheral tissues where they work as sentinels and facilitate immune tolerance [ 6].
3: After DCs are activated, they become mature DCs (mDCs), which critically required for priming naive T lymphocytes.
4: Upon activation, naive T cells start to proliferate and differentiate into effector cells, which are needed for the promotion of the adaptive immune response against pathogens.
5: On the other hand, the production of immune tolerance is crucial for the maintenance of self-tolerance under steady state conditions [ 7,  8].
