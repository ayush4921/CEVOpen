<p id="Par13">Dendritic cells (DCs) are one of the three mononuclear phagocyte system known for their exclusive characteristics [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. DCs contain distinct subpopulations critically essential for the generation of multiple functions in the immune system, which determine the outcome of immune responses. Immature DCs (imDCs) are located in the peripheral tissues where they work as sentinels and facilitate immune tolerance [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. After DCs are activated, they become mature DCs (mDCs), which critically required for priming naïve T lymphocytes. Upon activation, naïve T cells start to proliferate and differentiate into effector cells, which are needed for the promotion of the adaptive immune response against pathogens. On the other hand, the production of immune tolerance is crucial for the maintenance of self-tolerance under steady state conditions [
