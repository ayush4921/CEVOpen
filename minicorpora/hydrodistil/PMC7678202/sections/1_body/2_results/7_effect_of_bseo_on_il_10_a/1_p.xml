<p id="Par38">The immunomodulatory effect of crude BSEO on DCs was investigated by the determination of both IL-10 and IL-12p70 levels in DCs culture supernatant after 24 h treatment using ELISA assay. As illustrated in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref>, each of LPS, vitamin D3, and BSEO (5 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL or 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) stimulated the secretion of IL-10 and IL-12p70. However, BSEO-treated DCs secreted higher levels of IL-10 than LPS or vitamin D3-treated DCs. Although these increasing levels of IL-10 were not significant, however, it was significant compared to control. Alternatively, the effect of LPS on IL-12p70 secretion was significantly more pronounced than the effect of all other treatments.
