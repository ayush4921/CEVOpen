<p id="Par37">To explore the impact of BSEO on the endocytic capacity of monocyte-derived DCs, the FITC-dextran uptake assay was performed. LPS-stimulated DCs showed a significant reduction in FITC-dextran uptake (18.5 ± 9, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) compared to control unstimulated DCs. Whereas vitamin D3-treated DCs showed no significant difference in FITC-dextran uptake compared to controls. BSEO treatments (5 μg/mL or 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) were also unable to reduce dextran uptake by DCs, as uptake percentages remained similar to imDCs (Table
