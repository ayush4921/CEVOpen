<p id="Par35">To determine whether crude BSEO-induce DCs apoptosis, the expression of plasma membrane phosphatidylserine was detected using the Annexin V-FITC assay. To this end, treated DCs were compared to CPT-treated DCs as a positive control for apoptotic DCs. Data in TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref> revealed that no significant differences were found between DCs treated with any of the stimulants on the induction of early or late apoptosis compared to unstimulated controls. Whereas, CPT-treated DCs expressed significantly greater percentages of apoptosis (36%) compared to control unstimulated cells. In all treatment conditions, the viability of cells was not affected significantly.
