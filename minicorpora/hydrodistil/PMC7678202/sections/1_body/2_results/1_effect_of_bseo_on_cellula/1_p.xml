<p id="Par30">The cytotoxic effect of crude BSEO was determined against the HSD cell line and peripheral blood monocytes. Stimulation of cells with different concentrations of crude BSEO for 24 h showed decreased in cell viability compared to control untreated cells. The percentage of cell viability was decreased along with increased oil concentration from 5 to 50 μg/mL. HSD cells treated with 50-μg/mL crude BSEO showed a highly significant decrease in viability 52.1 ± 2.9 (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). Similarly, 50 μg/mL crude BSEO induced significant decrease in monocytes viability 72.5 ± 7.3 (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Therefore, 5 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL and 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL concentrations of crude BSEO were selected for this study (Table
