<p id="Par36">The ability of BSEO-treated DCs to prompt proliferation of allogeneic T cells was examined by MLR assay. The co-culture of BSEO-treated DCs with allogenic T cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. T cell proliferation capability was calculated by the percentage of CD3
 <sup>+</sup>CD71
 <sup>+</sup>proliferative T cells. Data demonstrated that the ability of BSEO-treated DCs to induce proliferation of allogeneic T cells were similar to vitamin D3-treated DCs but significantly lower (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01 for 5 μg/mL-treated DCs and 0.001 for 10 μg/mL-treated DCs) than the capacity of LPS-treated DCs. Interestingly, BSEO reduces the capability of T cells to proliferate even in combination with LPS when compared to cells treated with LPS alone (Fig.
