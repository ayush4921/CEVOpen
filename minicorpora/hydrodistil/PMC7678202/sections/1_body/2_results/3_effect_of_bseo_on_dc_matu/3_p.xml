<p id="Par34">Data in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref> showed that LPS stimulated DCs were expressed full maturation properties and turned into mDCs. However, stimulation with LPS in the presence of crude BSEO at 5 μg/mL or 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL did not show the same properties. The surface expression of CD86 and CD83 markers were assessed. Data indicated that the expression of CD86 was slightly reduced on DCs treated with the combined treatment in comparison to LPS-stimulated DCs. However, this reduction was not significant. Interestingly, data demonstrated that the exposure of DCs to the combined effect of LPS and BSEO (both 5 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL or 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL), significantly suppressed the expression of the maturation marker CD83 (
 <italic>P</italic>-value &lt; 0.001), even in the existence of LPS compared to DCs treated with LPS alone.
