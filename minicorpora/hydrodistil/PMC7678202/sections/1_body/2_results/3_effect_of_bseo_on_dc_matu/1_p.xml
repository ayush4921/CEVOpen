<p id="Par32">To study the effects of BSEO treatment on DC maturation, cells were isolated and cultured as described previously in the materials and methods. Throughout the culturing period, cells were visualized and photographed using an inverted phase-contrast microscope. On day eight after 24 h of stimulation, typical distinctive differences of imDCs and mDCs were observed. Typical morphology of differentiated imDCs appeared with irregular shape with short cytoplasmic projections (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). Unlike, LPS stimulated DCs which appeared elongated and more irregular in shape with numerous and long cytoplasmic projections (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). However, BSEO-treated cells showed as typical as imDCs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c &amp; d).
