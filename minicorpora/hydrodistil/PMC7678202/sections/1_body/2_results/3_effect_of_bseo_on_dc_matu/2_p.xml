<p id="Par33">To evaluate the effects of crude BSEO treatments on the expression of cell surface markers of DC after 24 h, the percentages of CD14, CD11c, HLA-DR, CD83, CD80, CD86, and CCR7 expression were analyzed by flow cytometry. Our results showed a decreased percentage of CD14 marker on crude BSEO treated DCs and decreased expression of HLA-DR and CD11c markers similar to control unstimulated DCs and vitamin D3-stimulated DCs (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Whereas the mean percentages of cells expressing maturation marker CD83, co-stimulatory molecules CD80 / CD86, and homing receptor CCR7 were remained significantly lower at both 5 μg/mL and 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL doses of BSEO in comparison to DCs treated with LPS. These results indicated the immature status of BSEO treated DCs.
