<p id="Par31">Monocytes were cultured with crude BSEO at 5 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL or 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL to test the ability of crude BSEO to encourage differentiation of monocytes into DCs. In parallel, monocytes were cultured either with GM-CSF plus IL-4 or 0.1% DMSO. After the incubation period, cells were investigated for DC cell surface markers. The results showed that crude BSEO did not affect cell phenotype compared to positive controls cultured with GM-CSF plus IL-4. The presence of BSEO in monocytes’ culture interfered with their differentiation into DCs. Whereas, cytokine-treated cells expressed low levels of CD14 (2.7 ± 1.5) and high levels of CD11c (97.2 ± 2.1) as typical immature DCs; in contrast, cells incubated with BSEO were significantly expressed high levels of CD14 (87.05 ± 2.6) and low levels of CD11c (5.45 ± 3.6). The expression of HLA-DR was slightly decreased in BSEO-treated cells compared to cytokine-treated cells, although no significant differences were observed. Moreover, cytokine-treated cells showed significant differences in the expression of CD86 in comparison to BSEO-treated cells and negative control cells as shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. The expression of CD86 was also positive on the PMBCs before culturing (data not shown).
