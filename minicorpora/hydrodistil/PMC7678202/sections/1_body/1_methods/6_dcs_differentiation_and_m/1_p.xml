 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL BSEO were added separately to adherent monocytes in the absence of cytokines. In parallel, adherent monocytes were also cultured in the presence of cytokines for comparison purposes. For the determination of DC maturation, cells were stimulated for further 24 h with either BSEO at 5 μg/mL or 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL. Vitamin D3 at 12.5 ng/mL was used to induce tolerogenic DCs. Mature DCs were achieved by adding LPS (1 μg/mL) as a positive control and imDCs were left unstimulated or stimulated with 1% of DMSO. The effects of BSEO were also investigated on 1
