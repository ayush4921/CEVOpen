0: To investigate the capability of BSEO to induce differentiation of monocytes into imDCs, 5 g/mL or 10  g/mL BSEO were added separately to adherent monocytes in the absence of cytokines.
1: In parallel, adherent monocytes were also cultured in the presence of cytokines for comparison purposes.
2: For the determination of DC maturation, cells were stimulated for further 24 h with either BSEO at 5 g/mL or 10  g/mL.
3: Vitamin D3 at 12.5 ng/mL was used to induce tolerogenic DCs.
4: Mature DCs were achieved by adding LPS (1 g/mL) as a positive control and imDCs were left unstimulated or stimulated with 1% of DMSO.
5: The effects of BSEO were also investigated on 1  g/mL LPS stimulated DCs [ 19].
