0: To determine the internalization capability of stimulated and unstimulated DCs, cells were collected and counted prior to staining.
1: Harvested cells were washed and incubated with prewarm RPMI-1640 media without serum containing 1 mg/mL FITC-dextran (MW 40000 Da powder, UFC Biotech, KSA) at either 4 C (negative control) or 37 C (positive control) for 3 h. Then, cells were washed with 5% ice-cold PBS supplemented FBS three times.
2: Endocytosis was assessed by flow cytometry and was presented as the percentage of the cells that endocytosed FITC-dextran [ 22].
3: Data analysis was performed using Navios flow cytometer (Beckman coulter life science, USA).
