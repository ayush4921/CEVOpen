0: For the induction of allogenic MLR, stimulated DCs (as a stimulator) were harvested, washed, and co-cultured with fresh allogeneic PBMCs (as a responder) in a ratio 1:10 for 3 days at 37 C in a 5% CO 2 incubator.
1: Allogeneic PBMCs were used as a source of T cells.
2: For comparison, imDCs and PBMCs were cultured separately and used as control.
3: After 3 days, cells were washed, counted, and stained with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD71 for 30 min at 4 C. Later, cells were washed twice and re-suspended in 200 L PBS supplemented with 2% FBS.
4: Finally, stained cells were acquired and analyzed by Navios flow cytometry and software (Beckman coulter life science, USA) [ 21].
