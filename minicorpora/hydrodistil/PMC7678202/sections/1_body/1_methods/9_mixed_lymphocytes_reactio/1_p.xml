<p id="Par24">For the induction of allogenic MLR, stimulated DCs (as a stimulator) were harvested, washed, and co-cultured with fresh allogeneic PBMCs (as a responder) in a ratio 1:10 for 3 days at 37 °C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator. Allogeneic PBMCs were used as a source of T cells. For comparison, imDCs and PBMCs were cultured separately and used as control. After 3 days, cells were washed, counted, and stained with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD71 for 30 min at 4 °C. Later, cells were washed twice and re-suspended in 200 μL PBS supplemented with 2% FBS. Finally, stained cells were acquired and analyzed by Navios flow cytometry and software (Beckman coulter life science, USA) [
