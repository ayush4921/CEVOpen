<p id="Par19">The present study was approved by the research ethics committee and performed at the Immunology Unit at KFMRC, KAU. DCs isolation and differentiation were performed as reported by others [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Briefly, Heparinized human peripheral blood was diluted in HBSS, and Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were separated by Lymphoprep density gradient centrifugation. Cells were washed and resuspended in red blood cell lysis buffer then washed twice with HBSS. A total of 50 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> PBMCs were resuspended in RPMI-1640 medium and plated in a 12 well plate at a density of 5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/mL and allowed to adhere for 2 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator. Non-adherent cells were gently removed by washing several times with warm RPMI-1640 medium and the remaining adherent cells (monocytes) were used or cultured for further investigations. For DCs differentiation, adherent cells were cultivated in complete RPMI-1640 media containing IL-4 (50 ng/mL) and GM-CSF (100 ng/mL) for 7 days. Cultured cells were further fed on day three with complete RPMI-1640 media supplemented with the same concentration of cytokines.
