0: The present study was approved by the research ethics committee and performed at the Immunology Unit at KFMRC, KAU.
1: DCs isolation and differentiation were performed as reported by others [ 17].
2: Briefly, Heparinized human peripheral blood was diluted in HBSS, and Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were separated by Lymphoprep density gradient centrifugation.
3: Cells were washed and resuspended in red blood cell lysis buffer then washed twice with HBSS.
4: A total of 50  10 6 PBMCs were resuspended in RPMI-1640 medium and plated in a 12 well plate at a density of 5  10 6 cells/mL and allowed to adhere for 2 h at 37 C in a 5% CO 2 incubator.
5: Non-adherent cells were gently removed by washing several times with warm RPMI-1640 medium and the remaining adherent cells (monocytes) were used or cultured for further investigations.
6: For DCs differentiation, adherent cells were cultivated in complete RPMI-1640 media containing IL-4 (50 ng/mL) and GM-CSF (100 ng/mL) for 7 days.
7: Cultured cells were further fed on day three with complete RPMI-1640 media supplemented with the same concentration of cytokines.
