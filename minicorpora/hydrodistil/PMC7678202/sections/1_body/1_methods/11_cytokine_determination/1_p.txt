0: The concentrations of IL-12p70 and IL-10 cytokines released by stimulated DCs were quantified by sandwich ELISA using reagents from ELISA MAXTM Deluxe Sets (BioLegend, San Diego, California, USA) as described by manufacturer instructions.
1: Cell culture supernatants of stimulated DCs, without or with BSEO, were collected and then filter sterilized and stored at  20 C. The absorbance value was estimated using a microplate reader at 450 nm within 30 min.
2: The minimal detection level for this assay was 2 pg/mL for IL-10 and 4 pg/mL for IL-12.
3: The absorbance value was estimated using a microplate reader (BioTek, Vermont, USA) at 450 nm within 30 min.
4: The data were analyzed with computer-based standard curve [ 23].
