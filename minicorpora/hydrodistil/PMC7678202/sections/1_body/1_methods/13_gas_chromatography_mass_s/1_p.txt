0: BESO was analyzed using a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC/MS); Clarus 500 GC/MS (PerkinElmer, Shelton, CT] as previously described [ 24].
1: The software controller/integrator was TurboMass, 5.4.2.1617 (PerkinElmer) and Teknokroma TR-CN100 GC capillary column, (60 m  0.25 mm ID 0.20 m df) was used (Teknokroma, Analitica SA, Barcelona, Spain).
2: The column temperature program was: 80 C hold for 5 min, increased to 150 C (rate, 5 C/min), and held for 5 min, increased to 270 C (rate, 20 C/min) and hold for 5 min.
3: The injector temperature was 220 C. MS scan was from 45 to 350 m/z.
4: The total ion chromatogram was recorded from 45 to 350 m/z.
5: The targeted peaks were extracted by the knowledge of major m/z fragments, averaged masses at the peak top, and searched for matched compounds using mass spectrometry data bank NIST2008 database.
6: The percentage composition of the essential oil was computed by the normalization method from the GC peak area measurements [ 24].
