<p id="Par28">BESO was analyzed using a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC/MS); Clarus 500 GC/MS (PerkinElmer, Shelton, CT] as previously described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The software controller/integrator was TurboMass, 5.4.2.1617 (PerkinElmer) and Teknokroma TR-CN100 GC capillary column, (60 m × 0.25 mm ID× 0.20 μm df) was used (Teknokroma, Analitica SA, Barcelona, Spain). The column temperature program was: 80 °C hold for 5 min, increased to 150 °C (rate, 5 °C/min), and held for 5 min, increased to 270 °C (rate, 20 °C/min) and hold for 5 min. The injector temperature was 220 °C. MS scan was from 45 to 350 m/z. The total ion chromatogram was recorded from 45 to 350 m/z. The targeted peaks were extracted by the knowledge of major m/z fragments, averaged masses at the peak top, and searched for matched compounds using mass spectrometry data bank NIST2008 database. The percentage composition of the essential oil was computed by the normalization method from the GC peak area measurements [
