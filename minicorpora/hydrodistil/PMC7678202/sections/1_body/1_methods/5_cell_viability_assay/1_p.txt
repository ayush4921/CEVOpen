0: HSD cells (at density of 1  10 5 cells/well and 1.5 mL/well in 12-well plates) and adherent monocytes were treated with crude BSEO at concentrations of 5 g/mL, 10  g/mL, 15  g/mL, 20  g/mL, and 50  g/mL.
1: DMSO (< 0.2% that had no toxic effect on cells) was used as control.
2: After 24 h, cells were collected, washed, and resuspended in PBS.
3: Cytotoxicity was determined by the trypan blue exclusion test by mixing an equal volume of 0.4% trypan blue dye with the cell suspension [ 18].
4: Cellular viability was determined using an inverted microscope (Nikon eclipse Ti, Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with digital camera software (NIS-Elements F 3.2, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan.
