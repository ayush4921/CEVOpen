0: Boswellia sacra oleogum resin was purchased from Muttrah Souq in Muscat city, the capital of the Sultanate of Oman.
1: Crude BSEO was extracted via hydrodistillation done using a regular hydrodistiller.
2: The oleogum resins (100 g) were mixed with 500 mL distilled water and heated at 55 C until thick solution was formed [ 15].
3: Then, the temperature of the hydrodistiller was increased up to 78 C and remained for 3 h. The resulting mixture was filtered using a 0.22 m filter (CHMLAB Group 08205, Barcelona (SPAIN), EEC).
4: Finally, the crude essential oil layer was separated manually using a sterilized plastic dropper.
5: The collected essential oil was dried over anhydrous MgSO4.
6: The harvested essential oil was stored in sealed vials at  80 C until use.
7: The stock solution of BSEO was prepared by dissolving in DMSO (1:1) to obtain an initial concentration of 25 mg/mL.
8: Then, the stock solution was diluted in culture media to get the concentrations at 5 g/mL, 10  g/mL, 15  g/mL, 20  g/mL, and 50  g/mL.
