 <italic>Boswellia sacra</italic> oleogum resin was purchased from Muttrah Souq in Muscat city, the capital of the Sultanate of Oman. Crude BSEO was extracted via hydrodistillation done using a regular hydrodistiller. The oleogum resins (100 g) were mixed with 500 mL distilled water and heated at 55 °C until thick solution was formed [

The resulting mixture was filtered using a 0.22 μm filter (CHMLAB Group 08205, Barcelona (SPAIN), EEC). Finally, the crude essential oil layer was separated manually using a sterilized plastic dropper. The collected essential oil was dried over anhydrous MgSO4. The harvested essential oil was stored in sealed vials at − 80 °C until use. The stock solution of BSEO was prepared by dissolving in DMSO (1:1) to obtain an initial concentration of 25 mg/mL. Then, the stock solution was diluted in culture media to get the concentrations at 5 μg/mL, 10
