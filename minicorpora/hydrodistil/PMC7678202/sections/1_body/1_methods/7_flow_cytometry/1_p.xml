<p id="Par22">All BSEO treated and untreated cells were analyzed by Navios flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter Life Science, USA) following induction of differentiation or maturation. Cells were harvested, washed, and counted before staining. Then cells were stained with recombinant monoclonal antibodies including APC-conjugated anti-CD14, FITC-conjugated anti-CD11c, anti-HLA-DR, anti-CD83, anti-CD80, anti-CD86, and anti-CCR7 for 30 min at 4 °C. For negative control staining, appropriate conjugated isotypes were used. Following staining, all cells were washed with cold PBS and resuspended in 500 μL of PBS. Data were acquired and analyzed by Navios software (Beckman coulter life science, USA) [
