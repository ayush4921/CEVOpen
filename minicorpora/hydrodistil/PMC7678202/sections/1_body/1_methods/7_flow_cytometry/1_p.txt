0: All BSEO treated and untreated cells were analyzed by Navios flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter Life Science, USA) following induction of differentiation or maturation.
1: Cells were harvested, washed, and counted before staining.
2: Then cells were stained with recombinant monoclonal antibodies including APC-conjugated anti-CD14, FITC-conjugated anti-CD11c, anti-HLA-DR, anti-CD83, anti-CD80, anti-CD86, and anti-CCR7 for 30 min at 4 C. For negative control staining, appropriate conjugated isotypes were used.
3: Following staining, all cells were washed with cold PBS and resuspended in 500 L of PBS.
4: Data were acquired and analyzed by Navios software (Beckman coulter life science, USA) [ 19].
