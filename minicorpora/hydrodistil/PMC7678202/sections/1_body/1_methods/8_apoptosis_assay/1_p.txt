0: To determine the effects of BSEO treatment on the induction of apoptosis or necrosis in DCs, apoptosis detection kit (TACSAnnexin V-FITC, Trevigen, Gaithersburg, USA) was used and performed according to the manufacturers guidelines.
1: CPT was used as an apoptosis inducer at a concentration of 10 mM for 4 h and purchased from Sigma Aldrich,St.
2: Louis, USA.
3: Briefly, cells were collected, washed once, and resuspended in 100 L of Annexin-V reagent.
4: Cells were left in the dark for 15 min at room temperature.
5: Finally, 400 L of 1X binding buffer was added to stained cells and acquired by Navios flow cytometry (Beckman coulter life science, USA) within 1 h and analyzed using Navios software [ 20].
6: Ten  L of PI was added to the cells prior to analysis by flow cytometry.
7: Consequently, viable cells do not take any color (Annexin V/PI-), early apoptotic cells are green (Annexin V+/PI-), late apoptotic cells are green and orange (Annexin V+/PI+), and necrotic cells are orange (Annexin V/PI+).
