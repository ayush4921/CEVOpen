<p id="Par23">To determine the effects of BSEO treatment on the induction of apoptosis or necrosis in DCs, apoptosis detection kit (TACS®Annexin V-FITC, Trevigen, Gaithersburg, USA) was used and performed according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. CPT was used as an apoptosis inducer at a concentration of 10 mM for 4 h and purchased from Sigma Aldrich®,St. Louis, USA. Briefly, cells were collected, washed once, and resuspended in 100 μL of Annexin-V reagent. Cells were left in the dark for 15 min at room temperature. Finally, 400 μL of 1X binding buffer was added to stained cells and acquired by Navios flow cytometry (Beckman coulter life science, USA) within 1 h and analyzed using Navios software [

 <italic>μ</italic>L of PI was added to the cells prior to analysis by flow cytometry. Consequently, viable cells do not take any color (Annexin V−/PI-), early apoptotic cells are green (Annexin V+/PI-), late apoptotic cells are green and orange (Annexin V+/PI+), and necrotic cells are orange (Annexin V−/PI+).
