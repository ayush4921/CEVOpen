<p id="Par54">This study focused on the immunomodulatory effects of BSEO on DCs viability, phenotype, and function. Our results showed that BSEO has anti-inflammatory properties mediated by DCs. It was demonstrated that crude BSEO acts as an immune suppressor of human peripheral blood monocyte-derived DCs, which may promote the Treg permissive environment. The suppression effects were evident in terms of differentiation, expression of maturation markers, cytokine production, and inhibition of monocyte-derived DCs stimulated with LPS. Analysis of the chemical composition of BESO revealed the presence of compounds with several biological activities including antibacterial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiparasitic, antineoplastic, properties that may explain the anti-inflammatory properties of
