<p id="Par40">Dendritic cells became promising tools involved in immunotherapeutic techniques. Down-regulation of the immune response is needed to mitigate the inflammation associated with DCs, while the upregulation of immune response requires promoting DCs differentiation and maturation. To our knowledge, no precursor data reported the impact of 
 <italic>Boswellia sacra</italic> essential oil (BSEO) on human monocyte-derived DCs as professional antigen-presenting immune cells. Therefore, in this study, we assessed the outcomes of BSEO treatment on human DCs properties. The concentrations of BSEO used were based on the extent of cytotoxicity confirmed by several viability assessments. Phenotypical and functional properties have been also studied using microscopy, flow cytometry, and ELISA.
