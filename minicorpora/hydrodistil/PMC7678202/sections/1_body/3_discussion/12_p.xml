<p id="Par51">In the present study, cytokine analysis of DCs supernatant after crude BSEO treatment revealed a significant increase in the levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 secretion and reduced levels of inflammatory cytokine IL-12. Since IL-10 cytokine causes a reduction of antigen-presenting and costimulatory molecules on DCs [
