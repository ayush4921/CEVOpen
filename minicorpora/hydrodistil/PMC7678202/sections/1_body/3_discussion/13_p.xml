<p id="Par52">In accordance to our data, it has been reported that the boswellic acids of 
 <italic>Boswellia serrata</italic> inhibit the regulation of TNF-α in LPS-stimulated monocytes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. Moreover, the crude methanolic extract of 
 <italic>Boswellia serrata</italic> and its pure component, 12-ursine-2-diketone, inhibited pro-inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in cultured human PBMCs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Recently, several studies confirmed the therapeutic potential of some Boswellia sp. extracts and their chemical constituents as anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and immunomodulatory effects including antimicrobial activity towards antibiotic-resistant bacteria such as 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. Other investigations revealed that the constituents in the oleogum resin from different Boswellia species exhibited cytotoxic efficacy against treatment-resistant human metastatic breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Moreover, the boswellic extracts and 11-keto-ß-boswellic acid were also reported to suppress the activities of proinflammatory cytokines in type 1 and type 2 diabetes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. The analgesic activity of Boswellia and its extract has been reported to reduce osteoarthritis patients pain [
