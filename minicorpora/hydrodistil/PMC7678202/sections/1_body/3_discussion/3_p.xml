<p id="Par42">The ability of crude oil to induce monocyte differentiation into DCs was investigated using the two chosen concentrations. Our results showed that the addition of 5

 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL crude BSEO to cultured monocytes did not induce complete differentiation into DCs compared to cytokine differentiated DCs. This was observed by the high expression of CD14, which is identified as a monocyte marker that usually suppressed upon differentiation into DCs. The effect of BSEO on CD14 expression, as a natural product, was also shown with a natural product chrysin, in which its suppression effect on DC differentiation from monocytes [
