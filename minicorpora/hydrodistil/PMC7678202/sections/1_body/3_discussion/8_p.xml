<p id="Par47">The development of na√Øve T cells into effector cells is one of the major functions of DCs to establish the desired response, either immunity or tolerance. In this study, the determination of CD3 and CD71 expressions were used as indicators of T cell proliferation [

 <sup>+</sup> cocultured T-cells that suggest its effect on regulating T-cells proliferation. Furthermore, the current crude BSEO showed an inhibitory effect on the ability of LPS to provoke T cell proliferation, where is similar to the effect of vitamin D3 on T cell response observed in this study. Strong evidence indicated that vitamin D3 induces tolerogenic properties of DCs, which correlate with inhibition of DC maturation, high level of IL-10 secretion, and impaired stimulatory capacity of T cells [
