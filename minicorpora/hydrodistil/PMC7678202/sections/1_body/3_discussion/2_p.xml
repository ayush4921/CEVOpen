<p id="Par41">Crude BSEO is a natural product, which has chemical constituents with potential effects. Some BSEO constituents may induce toxicity to normal cells. For this reason, different concentrations of BSEO was previously tested on HSD cells and monocytes before applying on DCs. Trypan blue exclusion assay indicated that 5 μg/mL or 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL crude BSEO had no toxic effects on normal cells, HSD cells, and monocytes as DC progenitors, compared to control cells. Otherwise, high concentrations of crude BSEO at 15, 20, and 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL reduced the viability of cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Based on the above findings, less toxic concentrations 5 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL and 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL were used in the following experiments. Similar findings on the impact of BSEO toxicity on normal cells were also reported by [
