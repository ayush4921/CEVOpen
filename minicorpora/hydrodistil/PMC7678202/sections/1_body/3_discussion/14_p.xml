<p id="Par53">In the present study, we attempted to explore the major chemical components in BESO (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab8" ref-type="table">8</xref>). We found that the highest abundant constituent is β-Caryophyllen, 20% of the BESO, which is a volatile natural bicyclic sesquiterpene that contributes to the aroma of black pepper and found in many essential oils, especially clove oil, 
 <italic>Cannabis sativa</italic>, rosemary, and hops. Due to its resemblance in structure and properties of cannabinoid related molecules, β-Caryophyllen binds to the cannabinoid 2 (CB2) receptor and exerts analgesic, anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. However, it does not bind to centrally expressed cannabinoid receptor type-1 (CB1) or exert psychoactive effects [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. The second abundant compound in BESO is δ-cadinene (10%), which is bicyclic sesquiterpenes that occur in a wide variety of essential oil-producing plants. Cadinene is found in several species of cotton and exerts antimalarial activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. β-Cubebene constitute 6.5% of the BESO content, which is a tricyclic sesquiterpene, a constituent of the leaf oil cubebene first isolated from 
 <italic>Piper cubeba</italic> berries, known as cubebs and exerts antioxidant and antimicrobial activities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. β-Elemen and l-Elemol are sesquiterpenoid, where β-Elemen has anticancer and antiangiogenic activities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and l-elemol play a role as antiinflammatory agents useful against atopic dermatitis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. α- α-Copaene is a complex, highly volatile, widely distributed plant sesquiterpene specially in Copaifera species that showed marked anti-inflammatory activities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The next abundant compound in BESO is Humulene (4.55%), also known as α-Caryophyllene, which is a naturally occurring monocyclic sesquiterpene usually found as a mixture with β-Caryophyllen, and the two are often found together as a mixture in many aromatic plants. It has topical and systemic anti-inflammatory properties [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], and is an effective analgesic when taken topically, orally, or by aerosol [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. tau-cadino Tau-cadinol is a cadinane sesquiterpenoid that has a role as an antimicrobial agent [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. (S)-cis-verbenol, a natural metabolite from (−)-alpha-pinene of the host pine tree, has been found to have anti-ischemic activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. Selinene is another sesquiterpene found in celery seeds that exhibits anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. (−)-γ-Cadinene is a sesquiterpene and can be isolated from A. terreus. It has antioxidant properties [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Terpinen-4-ol, the main component of the essential oil of Melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree oil), is 1-menthene carrying a hydroxy substituent at position 4. It exhibits several biological activities including antibacterial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiparasitic, antineoplastic, and apoptosis and inflammatory mediators production [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The presence of these constituents with mostly antinflammatory confirms our aforementioned in-vitro results.
