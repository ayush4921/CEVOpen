<p id="Par49">Endocytic capacity of mannose receptor is strong in imDC differentiated in the presence of GM-CSF and IL-4 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. While LPS-matured DCs express about 50% low levels of mannose receptor than present on imDCs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. This was also observed in our results when DCs were treated with LPS and FITC-dextran uptake was decreased.
