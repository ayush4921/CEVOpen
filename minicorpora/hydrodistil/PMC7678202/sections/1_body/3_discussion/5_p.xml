<p id="Par44">The modulation effects of BSEO on DCs maturation were comparable to the modulation of vitamin D3 on DCs, where vitamin D3 is known to block DCs maturation as previously reported [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. It has also been reported the reduction of bone marrow-derived murine DC maturation treated with curcumin in the lack or presence of LPS, and which significantly reduced the expression of CD86 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Both costimulatory molecules, CD80 and CD86, contribute to homeostasis and direct the immune response into immunosuppressive or immunostimulatory [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. It is well known that imDCs mediate immune tolerance, and a decrease in the expression of CD86 is a typical marker for a tolerogenic DC phenotype [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. However, CD80 has a higher affinity for CTLA-4 than CD86 and mediates immuno-regulatory responses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. In the current study, the crude BSEO-stimulated DCs exhibited higher expression of CD80 than had CD86. We can conclude that stimulation of imDCs by crude BSEO may develop semimature or tolerogenic DCs and may mediate immunoregulatory responses. This characteristic was accompanied with lower expression of antigen-presenting molecule HLA-DR as reported by [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].
