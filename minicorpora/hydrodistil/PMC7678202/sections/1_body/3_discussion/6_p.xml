<p id="Par45">Migration of DCs to T cells areas at lymphoid tissues and organs depends on the presence of the chemokine receptor CCR7. This important role of CCR7 in migration has been verified in a knockout mouse model [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. However, other reports have shown that, apart from chemotaxis, CCR7 controls the endocytosis level, survival, and maturation of DCs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. During maturation, CCR7 is upregulated to guides the migratory DCs to the nodes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Independently from maturation, CCR7-expressing imDCs subsets continuously migrate to the lymph nodes to contribute to the peripheral tolerance against self-antigens even in the absence of danger signals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>].
