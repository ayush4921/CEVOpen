<p id="Par46">The current study has demonstrated that DCs CCR7 expression upon addition of BSEO was significantly lower than that of LPS-stimulated DCs. Taking into account the immature status of the produced DCs, this finding may suggest that BESO-treated DCs has a teloregenic immune response. Although mature DCs use CCR7 to build up an effective adaptive immune response, imDCs use this certain receptor to migrate continuously to induce immune tolerance in lymph nodes [
