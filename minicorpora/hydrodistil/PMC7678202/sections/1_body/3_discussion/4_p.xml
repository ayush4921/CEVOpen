<p id="Par43">The cell surface phenotype of DCs is used to determine the developmental and maturational status of DCs, imDCs, or mDCs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The upregulation of HLA-DR, CD86, and CD83 expression on DCs is an indication of their maturation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Moreover, low levels of CD83 mediate impaired T cells stimulation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. In our hands, exposure to BSEO in the presence or absence of LPS, reduced significantly the expression of CD83, CD86, and HLA-DR on the surface of DCs, suggesting an immature phenotype of the produced DCs.
