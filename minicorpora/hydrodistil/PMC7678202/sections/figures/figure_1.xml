  <p>Morphology of DCs treated with crude BSEO. DCs were treated with either crude BSEO or LPS for 24 h and visualized using an inverted microscope. 
   <bold>a</bold> Represents 0.1%DMSO-treated DCs that show a typical morphology of imDCs, which appeared irregular shape with short cytoplasmic projections. 
   <bold>b</bold> Represents LPS-treated DCs that show a typical morphology of mDCs which seen elongated with long cytoplasmic projection. 
   <bold>c</bold> Represents DCs treated with 5 
   <italic>μ</italic>g/mL of BSEO and 
   <bold>d</bold> DCs treated with 10 
   <italic>μ</italic>g/mL of BSEO that exhibited imDCs features. Arrows pointed to DC projections. Photographed by phase-contrast inverted microscope (Original magnifications were 400X) at Immunology unit, KFMRC, King Abdulaziz University
