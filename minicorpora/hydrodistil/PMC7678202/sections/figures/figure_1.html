 <caption> Morphology of DCs treated with crude BSEO. DCs were treated with either crude BSEO or LPS for 24 h and visualized using an inverted microscope. a Represents 0.1%DMSO-treated DCs that show a typical morphology of imDCs, which appeared irregular shape with short cytoplasmic projections. b Represents LPS-treated DCs that show a typical morphology of mDCs which seen elongated with long cytoplasmic projection. c Represents DCs treated with 5  μg/mL of BSEO and d DCs treated with 10  μg/mL of BSEO that exhibited imDCs features. Arrows pointed to DC projections. Photographed by phase-contrast inverted microscope (Original magnifications were 400X) at Immunology unit, KFMRC, King Abdulaziz University </caption>
