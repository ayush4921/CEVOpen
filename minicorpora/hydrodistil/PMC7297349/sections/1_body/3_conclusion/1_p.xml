<p>The high content of xanthoxylin in the leaves of Luodian 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>balsamifera</italic> was considered to be the primary cause of the unsuccessful collection of EO using Clevenger apparatus in the general hydrodistillation. A modified hydrodistillation was designed to isolate EO from Luodian 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>balsamifera</italic> leaves. Six EOs of Luodian 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>balsamifera</italic> leaves harvested from different growth periods were successfully obtained by the modified hydrodistillation. The EOs contained a considerable amount of caryophyllene and xanthoxylin, which was significantly different from 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>balsamifera</italic> cultivated in other regions. The chemical components of EOs from 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>balsamifera</italic> leaves harvested from October to December were comparatively consistent, and these EOs had good ACs. Considering the yields and the ACs of EOs, for extracting EO with high quality, Luodian 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>balsamifera</italic> leaves should be harvested in November and December. The EO may be used extensively in pharmaceutical, food, and cosmetic industries.
