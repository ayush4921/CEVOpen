<p>The internal standard method was used in the quantitative determination of 
 <italic>l</italic>-borneol and xanthoxylin and was performed on GC-FID system mentioned above. Naphthalene was used as the internal standard (IS). The samples and IS were prepared in ethyl acetate, and the final concentration was 0.2 mg/mL. The validation of quantitative determination as follows: the linear range was 0.6–1875 μg/mL for 
 <italic>l</italic>-borneol and xanthoxylin; the accuracy was verified by eight replicate analyses with standard solution, the calculated RSD values for 
 <italic>l</italic>-borneol and xanthoxylin were 0.16% and 0.21%, respectively; moreover, the recoveries of two compounds were 97% and 96%.
