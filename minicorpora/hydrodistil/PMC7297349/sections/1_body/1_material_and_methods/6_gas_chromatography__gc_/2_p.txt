0: The internal standard method was used in the quantitative determination of  l-borneol and xanthoxylin and was performed on GC-FID system mentioned above.
1: Naphthalene was used as the internal standard (IS).
2: The samples and IS were prepared in ethyl acetate, and the final concentration was 0.2 mg/mL.
3: The validation of quantitative determination as follows: the linear range was 0.61875 g/mL for  l-borneol and xanthoxylin; the accuracy was verified by eight replicate analyses with standard solution, the calculated RSD values for  l-borneol and xanthoxylin were 0.16% and 0.21%, respectively; moreover, the recoveries of two compounds were 97% and 96%.
