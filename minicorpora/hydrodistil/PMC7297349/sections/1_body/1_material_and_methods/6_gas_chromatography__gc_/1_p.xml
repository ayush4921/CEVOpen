<p>The oil samples for GC analysis were prepared in 99% 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane. The final concentration was 0.5 mg/mL. GC analysis was executed on a Shimadzu GC-2010 gas chromatograph operated with a split/splitless injector and a Shimadzu AOC-20i autoinjector (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Column: CP-WAX capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 25 μm) (Varian, USA) and DB-5 capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 25 μm) (Agilent, USA). Temperature program: from 45°C (1 min) to 280°C (3 min) at 5°C/min. Injection temperature: 250°C. Injection volume: 1.0 μL. Carrier gas: Nitrogen, flow rate: 3 mL/min. Injection mode: split (1:5). FID temperature: 250°C. H
 <sub>2</sub> flow: 47 mL/min; air flow: 400 mL/min. Data handling was carried out by means of GCsolution 2.3 (Shimadzu).
