0: Fifty grams of leaves samples and 1 L distilled water were added into 2 L flask.
1: At first, the mixture was heated to boiling temperature, and 500 mL distillate was collected and then extracted using diethyl ether anhydrous (500 mL), the extraction solution was concentrated to obtain the extract which was named Aifen (AF).
2: The residual mixture was added with 500 mL of deionized water and then connected to the Clevenger apparatus for being distilled continuously.
3: In the end, two phases were observed in Clevenger apparatus, an EO and an aqueous phase ( Fig 1B).
4: The EO was collected and dried with anhydrous Na 2SO 4.
5: The yield of EO was used as a reference to optimize the distillation time (from 2 h to 10 h).
6: AF and EO were stored at 4C in dark glass bottles until analysis.
7: The processes were executed with ten replicates.
