<p>GC-MS analysis was executed with a Varian 1200L GC-MS/MS model gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer equipped with an autoinjector (Varian, Walnut Creek, CA, USA). Two capillary columns were the same as GC-FID system. The temperature program: from 45°C (0.5 min) to 280°C (3 min) at 5.0°C/min. Injection temperature: 250°C. Injection volume: 1.0 μL. Injection mode: 1:10. Carrier gas: He, constant linear velocity: 1.0 mL/min. MS interface temperature: 280°C; MS mode: EI; detector voltage: 1 kV; mass range: 35–500 uma; acquisition mode: full scan.</p>
