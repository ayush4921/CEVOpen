<p>The quantitation of EO components was based on the peak area normalization with response factors (RFs). The constituents of EO were complex, and these compound standards were lack, so it was unrealistic to determine the RFs of all compounds. Therefore, we used a solution introduced by Costa 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="pone.0234661.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], based on EO constituents classified by their functional groups and chemical classes. RFs are the average values of the response factors measured by individual standard compounds within the same chemical class and are recorded in 
 <xref rid="pone.0234661.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The quantification was applied in the concentration determination (%) of all oil components.
