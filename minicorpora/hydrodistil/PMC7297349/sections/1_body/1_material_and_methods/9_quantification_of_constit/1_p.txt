0: The quantitation of EO components was based on the peak area normalization with response factors (RFs).
1: The constituents of EO were complex, and these compound standards were lack, so it was unrealistic to determine the RFs of all compounds.
2: Therefore, we used a solution introduced by Costa  et al.
3: [ 24], based on EO constituents classified by their functional groups and chemical classes.
4: RFs are the average values of the response factors measured by individual standard compounds within the same chemical class and are recorded in  Table 1.
5: The quantification was applied in the concentration determination (%) of all oil components.
