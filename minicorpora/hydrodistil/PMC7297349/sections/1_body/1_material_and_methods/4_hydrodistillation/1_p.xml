However, there were white volatile on the surface of condenser inner wall and an aqueous phase (aromatic water) in Clevenger apparatus. The aqueous phase was extracted by diethyl ether anhydrous (100 mL), and the extraction solution was concentrated under vacuum. White volatiles (WV) and the extract of aqueous phase (EAP) were weighed and stored at 4Â°C in dark glass bottles until analysis, respectively. The experiments were executed with six replicates.
