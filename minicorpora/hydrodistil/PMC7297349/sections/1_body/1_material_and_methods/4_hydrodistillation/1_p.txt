0: The general hydrodistillation was executed in Clevenger apparatus.
1: Fifty grams of leaves samples and 1 L distilled water were added into 2 L flask and distilled for 10 h in Clevenger apparatus (Jingbo, Jintan, China) ( Fig 1A).
2: In the end, there was no EO to be collected.
3: However, there were white volatile on the surface of condenser inner wall and an aqueous phase (aromatic water) in Clevenger apparatus.
4: The aqueous phase was extracted by diethyl ether anhydrous (100 mL), and the extraction solution was concentrated under vacuum.
5: White volatiles (WV) and the extract of aqueous phase (EAP) were weighed and stored at 4C in dark glass bottles until analysis, respectively.
6: The experiments were executed with six replicates.
