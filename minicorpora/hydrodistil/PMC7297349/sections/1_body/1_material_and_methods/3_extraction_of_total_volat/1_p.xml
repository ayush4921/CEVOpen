<p>Fifty grams dried leaves of 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>balsamifera</italic> were distilled to collect 5 L of distillate (distillation time: 10 h), and the distillate was collected for extracting total volatiles (TV) of the leaves using same volume anhydrous diethyl ether under room temperature. The extract solution was dehydrated with anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated to obtain total volatiles. The TV was stored at –20°C in dark glass bottles until required. The process was executed in ten replicates.
