<p>Antioxidant activities (ACs) of six EOs were evaluated by DPPH radical-scavenging test, 
 <italic>β</italic>-carotene bleaching (BCB) test, and thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS) assay. The results of AC tests are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0234661.g006">Fig 6</xref>. Six EOs exhibited ACs in three tests, which were in agreement with our previous study [
 <xref rid="pone.0234661.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Several studies have reported that the ACs of volatile oils and EOs of 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>balsamifera</italic> were significantly different in several cultivation areas [

 <xref rid="pone.0234661.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, to our knowledge, there is no study on the ACs of EOs of Luodian 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>balsamifera</italic> in different growth stages. DPPH test, BCB test, and TBRAS test exhibited that the ACs of EO sample No. 2–4 were significantly higher (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt;0.05). It indicated that the ACs of EOs from the leaves of 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>balsamifera</italic> growing from October to December were at a high level. This observation is consistent with previous studies [
 <xref rid="pone.0234661.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The joint interpretation of PCA of chemical components and AC tests presented that the AC of EO from 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>balsamifera</italic> was highly correlated with the chemical composition of EO. Besides, the yields and the ACs of EOs from 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>balsamifera</italic> harvested in November and December were high, and the leaves of 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>balsamifera</italic> was suitable for harvesting and extracting EO in these two months.
