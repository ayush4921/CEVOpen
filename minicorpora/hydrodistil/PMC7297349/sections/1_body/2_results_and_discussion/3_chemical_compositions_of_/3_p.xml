<p>To have an overview of all results and to analyse the difference among six EOs harvested at different times. A principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to the data set of six EOs. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0234661.g005">Fig 5</xref> shows the score-plot for PC1 and PC2 from PCA of different EO samples. PC1 and PC2 explained a great part of the total variance (70.80%). The score-plot was better to understand the relationships between harvest times of the leaves and chemical compounds of EOs. The regions occupied by the six EO samples were distributed in three parts (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0234661.g005">Fig 5</xref>). PCA shows that the chemical components of EO2-EO4 belonged to one category, and were different from that of EO1, EO5, and EO6. It indicated that there were significant differences in chemical components of
