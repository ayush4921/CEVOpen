<p>As known from the previous report [
 <xref rid="pone.0234661.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], borneol (57%), caryophyllene (8%), and camphor (5%) are the main constituents in the volatile oil of 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>balsamifera</italic> cultivated in Luodian County, China. The main components which exist in the EO of 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>balsamifera</italic> grown in Guangxi and Hainan Province, China, Thailand, and Bengal are 
 <italic>l</italic>-borneol (20–42%), caryophyllene (8–10%), camphor (8–20%) [
 <xref rid="pone.0234661.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0234661.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0234661.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In previous reports, the contents of xanthoxylin in the EO of 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>balsamifera</italic> was 0–4%. Besides, the contents of caryophyllene, 
 <italic>γ</italic>-eudesmol, and α-cubenene are lower. However, in this study, the content of 
 <italic>l</italic>-borneol was very low (only about 1%) in the EO isolated from Luodian 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>balsamifera</italic> leaves, and the content of xanthoxylin was 11%.
