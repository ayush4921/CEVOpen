<p>It is important to know whether the modified procedure negatively affects the chemical composition of EO or not. Firstly, two key components (
 <italic>l</italic>-borneol and xanthoxylin) were investigated. 
 <italic>l</italic>-Borneol (content 68.12%) and xanthoxylin (content 22.03%) were two main compositions in AF, and the contents of other volatiles were less (content &lt; 2%). Moreover, 
 <italic>l</italic>-borneol existed in AF was 79.80% of total 
 <italic>l</italic>-borneol in leaves. According to the result of general hydrodistillation, the internal surface of condenser was stained with white volatile matter (WV), and 
 <italic>l</italic>-borneol was the main constituent (content 90.81%) of WV. Because the sublimation property of 
 <italic>l</italic>-borneol, even if 
 <italic>l</italic>-borneol was not distilled and removed in the first 500 mL distillate, 
 <italic>l</italic>-borneol was not in the EO and existed on the surface of condenser inner wall of the glassware.
