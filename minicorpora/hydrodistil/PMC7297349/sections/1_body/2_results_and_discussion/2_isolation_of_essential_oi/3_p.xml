<p>Besides, the content of xanthoxylin was monitored in the hydrodistillation process. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0234661.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, the yield of xanthoxylin decreased gradually with the increase of distillation volume, and 23.85% of total xanthoxylin was distilled and removed in the first 500 mL distillate. The above hydrodistillation rule had been confirmed in simultaneous distillation and extraction in the previous study [
 <xref rid="pone.0234661.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Therefore, we believed that the removal of partial 
 <italic>l</italic>-borneol and xanthoxylin did not affect the composition of EO. Likewise, the effects of other low content volatile components were little and could be ignored in the collection of EO. Thus, the modified hydrodistillation procedure was feasible to collect EO of Luodian
