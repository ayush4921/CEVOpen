<p>As inferred from the above deduction, if a part of xanthoxylin is removed from the leaves, we designed the modified hydrodistillation procedure to isolate EO of Luodian

 <xref rid="pone.0234661.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, the objective of the previous method was the efficient extraction of 
 <italic>l</italic>-borneol and was different from this study. In the beginning, the first 500 mL distillate was distilled to remove partial volatiles (namely “Aifen”) from the leaves, and then the residual leaves were further distilled for collecting EO using Clevenger apparatus. Fortunately, we successfully isolated EO of Luodian 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>balsamifera</italic> leaves, and the modified procedure showed that the above deduction was credible. Next, the distillation time was optimized, as seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0234661.g002">Fig 2</xref>. The yield of EO did not significantly increase after 8 h. Therefore, eight hours was considered to be the optimal distillation time. As shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0234661.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, the yield of “Aifen” (AF) was 1.16% (w/w), accounted for 47.93% of total volatiles (2.42%, w/w) in leaves (
