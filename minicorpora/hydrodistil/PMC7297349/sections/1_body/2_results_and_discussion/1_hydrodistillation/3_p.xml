<p>For the failure of extracting EO by the general hydrodistillation, we assumed that one or some volatile components had adverse effects on the extraction process of EO. As seen from 
 <xref rid="pone.0234661.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, the melting points of several compounds extracted from TV and AP were lower than 80°C, as a result, these compounds in AP (measured temperature: 85°C) were liquid state in the collecting tube, such as caryophyllene, dehydro-aromadendrane, caryophyllene epoxide, guaiol, 10-

However, the density of xanthoxylin (1.172 g/mL) was higher than water, and xanthoxylin would sink to the bottom of the water. Besides, xanthoxylin was the main component of TV (content 44.92%) and EAP. Moreover, the concentrate of xanthoxylin was at a high level (28 mg/mL) in AP in the collecting tube. According to the physicochemical properties of xanthoxylin, we speculated that xanthoxylin dispersed into AP and made the property of AP similar to organic solution. Low-density components would also follow xanthoxylin disperse into AP rather than float on the surface of AP. The total concentration of volatile components in AP was at a high level (80 mg/mL). Thus, the volatile components and water circulated simultaneously in Clevenger apparatus. The coaction of these volatile components made AP play the role of organic solvent to dissolve EO so that EO could not float on the surface of AP to be collected. In a word, the high content of xanthoxylin was the primary cause of the failure to obtain EO of Luodian
