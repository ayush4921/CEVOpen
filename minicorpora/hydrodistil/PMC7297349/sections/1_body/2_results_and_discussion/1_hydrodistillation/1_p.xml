<p>In the general hydrodistillation process, EO should float on the surface of aqueous phase and be collected in Clevenger apparatus (

Unfortunately, EO was not collected on the surface of aqueous phase, while a white volatile matter (WV) and an aqueous phase (AP) were observed in the condenser and collecting tube. In the previous study, there was a large number of high purity

 <xref rid="pone.0234661.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, the mean yields of WV and the extract of aqueous phase (EAP) were 0.58% and 0.80% (w/w), respectively. The sum of two yields was 1.38% (w/w) and was less than the yield of total volatiles (TV, 2.42%, w/w). Thus, the volatiles of Luodian
