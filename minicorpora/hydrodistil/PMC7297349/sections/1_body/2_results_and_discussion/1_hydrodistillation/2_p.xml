<p>Qualitative and quantitative analyses of WV and EAP are shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0234661.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, 
 <italic>l</italic>-borneol (content 90.81%) was the main component of WV. It meant that 
 <italic>l</italic>-borneol was mainly present on the surface of the condenser inner wall of the glassware (Clevenger apparatus), and it had little effect on the extraction of EO. Xanthoxylin (content 34.96%) and 
 <italic>l</italic>-borneol (content 17.82%) were the key components of EAP, and xanthoxylin was the important component dispersed in AP during the process of general hydrodistillation. In other words, xanthoxylin could affect the collection of EO. Besides, the contents of camphor, 
 <italic>α</italic>-cubenene, and caryophyllene in WV were more than 1%, and the contents of caryophyllene, caryophyllene epoxide, 
 <italic>γ</italic>-eudesmol were above 5% in EAP. The contents of 
 <italic>l</italic>-borneol and xanthoxylin in TV, WV, and EAP were calculated and compared. The sum of 
 <italic>l</italic>-borneol contents in WV (53.54%) and EAP (14.14%) accounted for 67.68% of total 
 <italic>l</italic>-borneol content in leaves. The content of xanthoxylin was rare in WV, and 25.69% of total xanthoxylin was present in EAP. Other parts of total 
 <italic>l</italic>-borneol and xanthoxylin were still kept in the leaves.
