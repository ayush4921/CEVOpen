 <italic>balsamifera</italic> are rich in volatile compounds and can be used to collect essential oil (EO), and EO is found to possess antimicrobial and insecticidal activities [

 <xref rid="pone.0234661.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Besides, the crude extracts, flavonoids, sesquiterpenoids, and triterpenoids were extracted from the leaves of

 <italic>balsamifera</italic> at different growth times were analysed and evaluated [
