<p>The preparation method of EO has been strictly defined, and the accurate specification is recorded in European Pharmacopoeia [
 <xref rid="pone.0234661.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Clevenger apparatus is the classical laboratory equipment based on the circulatory distillation approach for collecting EO [
 <xref rid="pone.0234661.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. It must be noted that the entire distillate (hydrolate and oil) is not extracted with a solvent. Otherwise, the crude product cannot be called any longer an EO, it is just a solvent extract from the distillate [
 <xref rid="pone.0234661.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The previous literatures recorded that organic solvent was used in the distillation process of Luodian 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>balsamifera</italic> for collecting the extracts [
 <xref rid="pone.0234661.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0234661.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], therefore, the product was called a solvent extract rather than EO, including the remains recovered using some solvent from the walls of the glassware (Clevenger apparatus). The solvent-free extraction of EO is a green preparation process and is worth to be investigated. In our previous work, the EO of Luodian 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>balsamifera</italic> leaves was collected unsuccessfully by the ordinary hydrodistillation in Clevenger apparatus. However, 
 <italic>l</italic>-borneol was present on the inner wall of the condenser in the hydrodistillation, and the purity of 
 <italic>l</italic>-borneol was 82% [
 <xref rid="pone.0234661.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The above results can be used as a reference, and a modified hydrodistillation method was designed using volatile oil extraction apparatus (VOEA) recorded in the Chinese Pharmacopeia to collect EO of Luodian 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>balsamifera</italic> leaves [
 <xref rid="pone.0234661.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].
