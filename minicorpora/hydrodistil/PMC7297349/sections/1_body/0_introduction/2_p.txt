0: The preparation method of EO has been strictly defined, and the accurate specification is recorded in European Pharmacopoeia [ 19].
1: Clevenger apparatus is the classical laboratory equipment based on the circulatory distillation approach for collecting EO [ 20].
2: It must be noted that the entire distillate (hydrolate and oil) is not extracted with a solvent.
3: Otherwise, the crude product cannot be called any longer an EO, it is just a solvent extract from the distillate [ 21].
4: The previous literatures recorded that organic solvent was used in the distillation process of Luodian  B.  balsamifera for collecting the extracts [ 15, 17], therefore, the product was called a solvent extract rather than EO, including the remains recovered using some solvent from the walls of the glassware (Clevenger apparatus).
5: The solvent-free extraction of EO is a green preparation process and is worth to be investigated.
6: In our previous work, the EO of Luodian  B.  balsamifera leaves was collected unsuccessfully by the ordinary hydrodistillation in Clevenger apparatus.
7: However,  l-borneol was present on the inner wall of the condenser in the hydrodistillation, and the purity of  l-borneol was 82% [ 22].
8: The above results can be used as a reference, and a modified hydrodistillation method was designed using volatile oil extraction apparatus (VOEA) recorded in the Chinese Pharmacopeia to collect EO of Luodian  B.  balsamifera leaves [ 23].
