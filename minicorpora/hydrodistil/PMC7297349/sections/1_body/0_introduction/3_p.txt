0: In the study, we investigated the reason why we cannot obtain the EO by the general hydrodistillation using Clevenger apparatus more deeply.
1: Moreover, the EOs of Luodian  B.  balsamifera leaves harvested from different times were collected using Clevenger apparatus by the modified hydrodistillation method.
2: The chemical components of EOs were determined by GC-FID and GC-MS, the antioxidant activities of EOs were evaluated by DPPH radical scavenging test,  -carotene bleaching (BCB) test, and thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS) assay.
3: Moreover, the optimum harvest time of Luodian  B.  balsamifera leaves was reported.
