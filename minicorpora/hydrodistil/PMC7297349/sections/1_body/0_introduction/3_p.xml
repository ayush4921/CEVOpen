<p>In the study, we investigated the reason why we cannot obtain the EO by the general hydrodistillation using Clevenger apparatus more deeply. Moreover, the EOs of Luodian 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>balsamifera</italic> leaves harvested from different times were collected using Clevenger apparatus by the modified hydrodistillation method. The chemical components of EOs were determined by GC-FID and GC-MS, the antioxidant activities of EOs were evaluated by DPPH radical scavenging test, 
 <italic>Î²</italic>-carotene bleaching (BCB) test, and thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS) assay. Moreover, the optimum harvest time of Luodian 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>balsamifera</italic> leaves was reported.
