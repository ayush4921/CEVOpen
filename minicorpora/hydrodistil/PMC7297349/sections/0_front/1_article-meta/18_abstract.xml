 <p>Xanthoxylin was the main compound (content 44.92% of total volatiles) in the leaves of Luodian 
  <italic>B</italic>. 
  <italic>balsamifera</italic>, which might be the key cause of failure in collecting essential oil (EO) of the leaves using general hydrodistillation in Clevenger apparatus. A modified hydrodistillation equipped with Clevenger apparatus was designed for isolating EO from the leaves. Six EOs of Luodian 
  <italic>B</italic>. 
  <italic>balsamifera</italic> harvested once a month from September to next February were collected successfully. The main components of EOs were 
  <italic>δ</italic>-elemene, 
  <italic>α</italic>-cubenene, caryophyllene, caryophyllene epoxide, 
  <italic>γ</italic>-eudesmol, xanthoxylin, and 
  <italic>α</italic>-eudesmol. The EOs of Luodian 
  <italic>B</italic>. 
  <italic>balsamifera</italic> collected from October to December had higher antioxidant activities (ACs). Combining the principal component analysis of chemical components with the results of ACs and the yields of six EOs, the leaves of Luodian 
  <italic>B</italic>. 
  <italic>balsamifera</italic> were suitable to be harvested in November and December to obtain EO with high quality.
