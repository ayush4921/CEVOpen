 <italic>Clavibacter michiganensis</italic>, 
 <italic>Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens</italic>, 
 <italic>Xanthomonas citri</italic>, and 
 <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> were supplied by the Department of Plant Protection, Shiraz university, and Bacillus subtilis, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> were obtained from Institute of Biotechnology, Shiraz University. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the essential oils was determined by nutrient broth micro-dilution assay [
 <xref rid="B49-antibiotics-09-00409" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Bacterial species were cultured at 37 °C for 18 h into a nutrient broth medium on a shaker and their density was measured at OD
 <sub>600</sub> using a spectrophotometer. The EOs were dissolved in sterile nutrient broth medium containing 5% dimethyl sulfoxide and 2.5% tween 80 and the serial two-fold dilutions of essential oils were prepared within the concentration ranges of 0.0312–16 mg/ml. Chloramphenicol (0.5%, Sina Darou, Iran; ranging from 0.00625 to 5 mg/ml) was used as positive control, while 5% dimethyl sulfoxide and 2.5% tween 80 (as solvent for EOs) were considered as negative control for all the bacteria. An amount of 100 μL of the diluted essential oils was added to each well containing 20 μL fresh bacterial suspension (OD = 0.5 at 600 nm). The microplates were covered and incubated overnight at 37 °C in a shaking incubator to mix the contents of the wells and then 20 μL of 0.5% 
 <italic>p</italic>-iodonitrotetrazolium chloride (INT, Sigma-Aldrich) solution was added and incubated for 30 min in a shaking incubator. The MIC was recorded as the first concentration of the essential oil with no bacterial growth, which prevented the color change of the medium [
 <xref rid="B50-antibiotics-09-00409" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Before adding INT to the wells, the absorbance of bacterial growth was measured at 600 nm and the results of both methods were checked to obtain the real MIC values. The experiments were repeated twice with three replicates.
