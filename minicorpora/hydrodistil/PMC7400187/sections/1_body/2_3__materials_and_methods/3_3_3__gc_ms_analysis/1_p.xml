<p>The EOs composition was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). GC-MS analyses of the EO samples were carried out using a GC (Model 7890A; Agilent Technologies), equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and an HP-5 column (30 m × 0.32 mm i.d.; film thickness 0.25 μm). The program of column thermal started at 60 °C, then increased at the rate of 3 °C/min to 210 °C. Finally, the temperature reached 240 °C at the rate of 20 °C/min and maintained at the final temperature for 8.5 min. The injector temperature was 280 °C. Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas which contained an inlet flow of 1 mL/min. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis was conducted by the same GC coupled with a mass-spectrometer (Model MS-5975C, Agilent Technologies). The column included a HP-5MS (30 m × 0.32 mm i.d.; film thickness 0.25 μm). The injector and MS detector temperature was 280 °C. The ionization energy was 70 eV. Helium was also used as the carrier gas at 1 mL/min. </p>
