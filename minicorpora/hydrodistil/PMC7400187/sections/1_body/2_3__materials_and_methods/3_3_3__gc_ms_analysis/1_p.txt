0: The EOs composition was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).
1: GC-MS analyses of the EO samples were carried out using a GC (Model 7890A; Agilent Technologies), equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and an HP-5 column (30 m  0.32 mm i.d.
2: ; film thickness 0.25 m).
3: The program of column thermal started at 60 C, then increased at the rate of 3 C/min to 210 C. Finally, the temperature reached 240 C at the rate of 20 C/min and maintained at the final temperature for 8.5 min.
4: The injector temperature was 280 C. Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas which contained an inlet flow of 1 mL/min.
5: Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis was conducted by the same GC coupled with a mass-spectrometer (Model MS-5975C, Agilent Technologies).
6: The column included a HP-5MS (30 m  0.32 mm i.d.
7: ; film thickness 0.25 m).
8: The injector and MS detector temperature was 280 C. The ionization energy was 70 eV.
9: Helium was also used as the carrier gas at 1 mL/min.
