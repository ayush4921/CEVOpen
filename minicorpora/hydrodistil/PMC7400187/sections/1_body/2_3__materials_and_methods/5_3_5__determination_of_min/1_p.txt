0: The minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of  O. decumbens essential oils was determined [ 51].
1: The amount of 5 L of MIC and higher concentrations (without INT) were spread on nutrient agar plates and incubated at 37 C overnight.
2: The first concentration that showed no bacterial growth on nutrient agar medium was considered as MBC.
3: The experiments were repeated twice with three replicates.
