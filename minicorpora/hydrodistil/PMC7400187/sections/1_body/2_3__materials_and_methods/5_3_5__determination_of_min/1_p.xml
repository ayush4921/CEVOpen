<p>The minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of 
 <italic>O. decumbens</italic> essential oils was determined [
 <xref rid="B51-antibiotics-09-00409" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The amount of 5 μL of MIC and higher concentrations (without INT) were spread on nutrient agar plates and incubated at 37 °C overnight. The first concentration that showed no bacterial growth on nutrient agar medium was considered as MBC. The experiments were repeated twice with three replicates.
