<p>The main essential oil constituents were thymol (20.3–36.4%), carvacrol (18.8–33.1%), γ-terpinene (10.6–25.9%), and 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (9.5–17.3%). Quantitatively they showed a significant variability at variance with the geographic origin of the plant material. The highest amount of thymol was found in Nourabad Mamasani and Dehdasht populations, with 36.4 and 35.2%, respectively, whereas the lowest one (20.3%) was found in the Kahnoyeh population. Moreover, the highest percentage of carvacrol was found in the Nourabad Mamasani and Dehdasht populations, with 33.1 and 30.6%, respectively, while the lowest one was detected in the Kahnoyeh population (18.8%). γ-Terpinene, which is related to the biosynthesis of the phenolic monoterpenes [
