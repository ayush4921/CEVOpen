<p>The essential oil chemical profiles of 
 <italic>O. decumbens</italic> [
 <xref rid="B33-antibiotics-09-00409" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] detected in this study were in agreement with those described in previous studies in which thymol, carvacrol, γ-terpinene, and 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene resulted the major volatile constituents [

 <xref rid="B38-antibiotics-09-00409" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The variation in the number and content of essential oil constituents may be ascribable to factors including genetics, climatic, and geographic conditions, chemotype, collection time, and extraction technique [

 <xref rid="B40-antibiotics-09-00409" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. It has been shown that geographical and meteorological factors affect the content and composition of

 <xref rid="B41-antibiotics-09-00409" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Indeed, the essential oil content in 
 <italic>O. decumbens</italic> showed a significant positive correlation with the soil sand content and temperature, while it revealed a negative correlation with the altitude [
 <xref rid="B33-antibiotics-09-00409" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In our study, the 
 <italic>O. decumbens</italic> populations were collected at the same stage and time (flowering stage, 1–21 June 2017), thus we can exclude the effect of the phenological cycle. Also, the extraction and analytical methods were conducted in the same way. Therefore, we assume that the climate, environmental, and geographic conditions play a major role in affecting the essential oil chemical composition.
