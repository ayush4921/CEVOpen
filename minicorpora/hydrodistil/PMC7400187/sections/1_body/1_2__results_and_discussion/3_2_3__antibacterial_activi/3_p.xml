<p>The thymol and carvacrol contents and the MIC and MBC values were selected for principal component analysis (PCA).

The essential oils from Nourabad Mamasani and Dehdasht populations were placed closer to the lines of thymol and carvacrol contents highlighting the greatest correlation with these components. On the other hand, the oil from Kahnoyeh population was placed close to MBC showing the lowest bactericidal activity (
