<p>Moreover, the essentials oil from Nourabad Mamasani and Dehdasht populations showed the best performance in terms of MIC and MBC values, highlighting the highest inhibitory activity against both groups of bacteria. On the other hand, the essential oil from the Kahnoyeh population showed the lowest antibacterial activity with the highest MIC and MBC values. The strongest antibacterial activity of the essential oils from Nourabad Mamasani and Dehdasht populations might be attributed to the highest content of thymol (36.4 and 35.2%, respectively) and carvacrol (33.1 and 30.6%, respectively) and their possible synergism [

On the other hand, the oil from the Kahnoyeh population, with the lowest amount of thymol (20.3%) and carvacrol (18.8%), showed the weakest inhibitory activity. These differences in the content of thymol and carvacrol as the most important antimicrobial compounds, may explain the variability and level of the antibacterial activity among the four

 <xref rid="B45-antibiotics-09-00409" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. As a matter of fact, Pearson correlation analysis was conducted to evaluate the relationship between the thymol and carvacrol contents and the antibacterial activity (MICs and MBCs). Results showed that thymol had a significant positive correlation with the carvacrol content (r = 0.996, significant at the 0.01 level), thus the thymol content increased together with that of carvacrol. Taken together, the thymol and carvacrol contents showed a significant negative correlation with MIC values (r = 0.984 and 0.979, respectively, significant at the 0.01 level) meaning that the most active essential oils were the richest in these compounds. In addition, the MBC values exhibited a non-significant positive correlation with MIC values (r = 0.729) and a non-significant negative correlation with the thymol and carvacrol contents (r = 0.833 and 0.851).
