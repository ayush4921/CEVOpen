<p>Our results are in agreement with previous studies which documented the effectiveness of thymol and carvacrol compounds against various bacteria [
 <xref rid="B46-antibiotics-09-00409" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In addition, thymol and carvacrol were suggested as the bioactive compounds against 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus,</italic> and 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> [
 <xref rid="B17-antibiotics-09-00409" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Thymol and carvacrol inhibit the bacterial growth and ergosterol biosynthesis and also disrupt the bacterial membrane, resulting in ions and ATP leakage, and cell death [
 <xref rid="B14-antibiotics-09-00409" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B47-antibiotics-09-00409" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,
 <xref rid="B48-antibiotics-09-00409" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The average MICs and MBCs displayed by the essential oils indicated that 
 <italic>Clavibacter michiganensis</italic> and 
 <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> were the most susceptible phytopathogens with the lowest MIC values (0.44 mg/ml). While, 
 <italic>Xanthomonas citri</italic>, with the highest MIC values, showed the strongest resistance to the essential oils. In some cases, the essential oils activity was better than that of chloramphenicol used as positive control (

 <xref rid="antibiotics-09-00409-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Indeed, the essential oils from Nourabad Mamasani, Dehdasht, and Behbahan populations inhibited 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, with MIC values (0.0625, 0.25, and 0.5 mg/ml, respectively) lower than that of chloramphenicol. Moreover, the oil from Nourabad Mamasani showed the strongest activity against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, with a MIC value (0.25 mg/ml) lower than that of chloramphenicol (
 <xref rid="antibiotics-09-00409-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Furthermore, considering the average MBC of all essential oils assayed, 
 <italic>Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> showed the highest and lowest sensitivity (2 and 8 mg/ml), respectively (
 <xref rid="antibiotics-09-00409-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). It is worth noting that the bactericidal activity of the essential oil from Nourabad Mamasani, showing the highest content of thymol and carvacrol, was higher than that of chloramphenicol against both groups of bacteria. Based on these findings, the Nourabad Mamasani population was found to be the best one, offering the conditions allowing plants to produce essential oils with high yield and high content of thymol and carvacrol. This assures a notable antibacterial activity against human pathogens and phytopathogens.
