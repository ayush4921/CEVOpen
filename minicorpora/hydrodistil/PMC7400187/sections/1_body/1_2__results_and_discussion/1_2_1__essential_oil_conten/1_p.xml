<p>The essential oil content differed among the various

 <xref rid="B33-antibiotics-09-00409" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. On the other hand, the values reported in previous reports varied from 0.1 to 8.1% [

 <xref rid="B39-antibiotics-09-00409" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The highest and lowest contents were found in Behbahan and Nourabad Mamasani populations with 8.52 and 3.34%, respectively. Moreover, Dehdasht (5.19%) and Kahnoyeh (5.32%) populations showed no significant differences. The essential oil content of Behbahan population, with 8.52%, showed a remarkable difference compared to those previously reported for several 
 <italic>O. decumbens</italic> populations [
 <xref rid="B2-antibiotics-09-00409" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-antibiotics-09-00409" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,

 <xref rid="B39-antibiotics-09-00409" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. A number of various factors, including genetics, soil, geographic, and climatic conditions affect the essential oil content [
 <xref rid="B40-antibiotics-09-00409" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In addition, some factors like altitude have been reported to affect the essential oil content [
 <xref rid="B33-antibiotics-09-00409" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="B40-antibiotics-09-00409" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,
 <xref rid="B41-antibiotics-09-00409" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In our study, the highest content was found in the essential oil from Behbahan population growing at the lowest altitude (394 m), followed by that from Kahnoyeh and Dehdasht populations located at 758 and 971 m a.s.l., respectively. Also, the oil from Nourabad Mamasani population, growing at the highest altitude (1268 m), showed the lowest content. Based on our results, we can conclude that the highest essential oil contents were obtained at lower altitudes. This finding is in accordance with that reported in another study in which the authors showed a significant negative relationship between the 
 <italic>O. decumbens</italic> essential oil content and the altitude [
 <xref rid="B41-antibiotics-09-00409" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Thus, fields at low cultivation altitudes should be considered to produce essential oils with high yield.
