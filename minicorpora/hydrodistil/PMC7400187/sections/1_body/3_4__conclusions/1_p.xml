<p>The results of this work shed light on the positive relationship between thymol and carvacrol contents and the level of antibacterial activity exhibited by the 
 <italic>O. decumbens</italic> essential oils. The present study highlighted also the remarkable variability in the essential oil composition, content, and antibacterial activity of four Iranian populations of 
 <italic>O. decumbens</italic>. These differences might be due to a number of factors including plant genetics and environmental factors characterizing each growing area for 
 <italic>O. decumbens</italic> populations. Notably, the essential oil from the Nourabad Mamasani population exhibited a pronounced antibacterial activity and this was correlated with the highest essential oil contents of thymol and carvacrol. Interestingly, the MBC of this essential oil revealed to be better than that of the positive control chloramphenicol. On this basis, the essential oil of Nourabad Mamasani population is a valuable thymol and carvacrol-rich source which may be considered as a promising natural alternative to conventional antibiotics to be used to combat pathogens impacting human health and agriculture. Further studies are required to determine the effect of genetics and environmental factors on the content of thymol and carvacrol in the field. These measures might be effective in improving the amount of thymol and carvacrol constituents of the plants aimed to exploit them in the agrifood and pharmaceutical industries. The findings of this study could provide effective information for the commercial cultivation and breeding of 
 <italic>O. decumbens</italic> in order to exploit its valuable compounds.
