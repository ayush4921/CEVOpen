<p>The main constituents and their possible synergistic interactions determine the biological activities of plant essential oils [
 <xref rid="B37-antibiotics-09-00409" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Thus, the variation in chemical composition detected among various populations may affect the level of biological properties of a plant species, compromising in some cases its use on an industrial level. A previous study showed that essential oils from five populations of 
 <italic>O. decumbens</italic> collected in different regions showed no significant differences in antimicrobial activity [
 <xref rid="B17-antibiotics-09-00409" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. With regard to possible differences in chemical composition among different 
 <italic>O. decumbens</italic> accessions [

 <xref rid="B36-antibiotics-09-00409" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], it is of industrial importance to screen and select those populations characterized by the best fingerprint, in terms of bioactive compounds assuring a strong and reliable antibacterial activity. Therefore, the present study was aimed to investigate the chemical variability of essential oils in 
 <italic>O. decumbens</italic> growing in different Iranian regions and to evaluate its effect on the antibacterial activity exerted on different bacterial strains of human pathogens and phytopathogens.
