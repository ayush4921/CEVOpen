0: The main constituents and their possible synergistic interactions determine the biological activities of plant essential oils [ 37].
1: Thus, the variation in chemical composition detected among various populations may affect the level of biological properties of a plant species, compromising in some cases its use on an industrial level.
2: A previous study showed that essential oils from five populations of  O. decumbens collected in different regions showed no significant differences in antimicrobial activity [ 17].
3: With regard to possible differences in chemical composition among different  O. decumbens accessions [ 2, 7, 30, 33, 34, 35, 36], it is of industrial importance to screen and select those populations characterized by the best fingerprint, in terms of bioactive compounds assuring a strong and reliable antibacterial activity.
4: Therefore, the present study was aimed to investigate the chemical variability of essential oils in  O. decumbens growing in different Iranian regions and to evaluate its effect on the antibacterial activity exerted on different bacterial strains of human pathogens and phytopathogens.
