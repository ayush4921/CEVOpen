 <italic>Oliveria decumbens</italic> Vent., belonging to the Apiaceae family, is an annual, aromatic herb, endemic to southern and western parts of Iran [
 <xref rid="B1-antibiotics-09-00409" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The aerial parts of this plant have been used to cure fever, abdominal pain, indigestion, and diarrhea [

 <italic>O. decumbens</italic> is exploited in Persian traditional medicine for the treatment of cancer, infections, and inflammation [

 <italic>Oliveria decumbens</italic> is a good source of essential oil which has already been reported to exhibit notable antioxidant activity [
 <xref rid="B6-antibiotics-09-00409" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Notably, an 
 <italic>O. decumbens</italic> emulsion exhibited strong radical scavenging effects and suppressed lipid peroxidation in both chemical assays and living cells [
 <xref rid="B7-antibiotics-09-00409" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This essential oil has also been reported to have insecticidal activity against the cabbage looper 
 <italic>Trichoplusia ni</italic> (HÃ¼bner) [
 <xref rid="B8-antibiotics-09-00409" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Finally, the 
 <italic>O. decumbens</italic> essential oil showed cytotoxic effects on several cancer cell lines [

 <xref rid="B9-antibiotics-09-00409" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Actually, essential oils are natural sources of volatile, lipophilic mixtures of several dozens of compounds which are able to interact with the cell wall, increasing its permeability, or disrupting the energy production system of the cells. In addition, they exert an important inhibition of trans-membrane and cytosol enzymes as well as anti-quorum sensing activity [
