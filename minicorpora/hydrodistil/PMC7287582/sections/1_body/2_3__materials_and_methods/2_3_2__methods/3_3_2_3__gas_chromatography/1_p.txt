0: Essential oils from myrtle plants were stored in amber vial bottles at +4 C until analysis by GCMS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Milan, Italy).
1: A sample of 5 L of essential oil taken from the essential oils stored for GCMS analysis with the help of a micro syringe was injected into 2 mL vials containing cyclohexane.
2: Analysis of the essential oils obtained in high volume was carried out by using a Thermo Scientific DSQ model Gas Chromatograph equipped with MS, auto sampler, and TR-5MS (5% phenyl polysilphenylenesiloxane, 0.325 mm  60 m i.d, film thickness 0.25 m).
3: The carrier gas was helium (99.9%) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min; ionization energy was 70 eV.
4: Mass range was  m/ z 50650 amu.
5: Data acquisition was in scan mode.
6: MS transfer line temperature was 280 C, MS ionization source temperature was 200 C, the injection port temperature was 250 C. The samples were injected with a 250 split ratio.
7: The injection volume was 1 L. Oven temperature was programmed in the range of 50 to 220 C at 3 C/min.
8: The structure of each compound was identified by comparison with their mass spectrum (Wiley9 library).
9: The data were handled using the Xcalibur software program (version 2.1.0 SP1, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Milan, Italy).
