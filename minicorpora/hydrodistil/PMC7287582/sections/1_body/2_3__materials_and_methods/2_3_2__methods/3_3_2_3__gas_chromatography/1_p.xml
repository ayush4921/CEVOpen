<p>Essential oils from myrtle plants were stored in amber vial bottles at +4 °C until analysis by GC–MS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Milan, Italy). A sample of 5 µL of essential oil taken from the essential oils stored for GC–MS analysis with the help of a micro syringe was injected into 2 mL vials containing cyclohexane. Analysis of the essential oils obtained in high volume was carried out by using a Thermo Scientific DSQ model Gas Chromatograph equipped with MS, auto sampler, and TR-5MS (5% phenyl polysilphenylenesiloxane, 0.325 mm × 60 m i.d, film thickness 0.25 µm). The carrier gas was helium (99.9%) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min; ionization energy was 70 eV. Mass range was

The samples were injected with a 250 split ratio. The injection volume was 1 μL. Oven temperature was programmed in the range of 50 to 220 °C at 3 °C/min. The structure of each compound was identified by comparison with their mass spectrum (Wiley9 library). The data were handled using the Xcalibur software program (version 2.1.0 SP1, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Milan, Italy).
