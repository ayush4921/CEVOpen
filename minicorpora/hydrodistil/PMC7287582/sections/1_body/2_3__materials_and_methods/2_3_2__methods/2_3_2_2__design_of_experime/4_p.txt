0: The experiments were randomly performed.
1: The following response function approximated by the second degree polynomial equation (Equation (2)) was used to correlate the dependent variable (Y) with input parameters (X 1X 3): (2)Y=0+1X1+2X2+3X3 + 11X12+ 22X2 2+ 33X32+ 12X1X2+ 13X1X3+ 23X2X3 where  0 is the model constant,  13 the linear coefficients,  1133 the quadratic coefficients, and  12, 13, 23 the cross-products coefficients.
2: Statistica StatSoft Release software package was used for the determination of the coefficients of Equation (1) by regressional analysis of the experimental data.
3: A stepwise regression analysis was conducted to build the second order polynomial equations for the response variable.
4: The significant terms ( p< 0.05) were selected for the final equation and the reduced quadratic polynomial model was obtained.
5: The best fitting mathematical model was selected based on the determination coefficient, correlation coefficient, analysis of variance, and residual analysis.
6: To investigate the combined effect of independent variables on the response, three-dimensional response surfaces were also drawn.
7: The Taguchi signal/noise ratio was finally used for the evaluation of the design robustness.
