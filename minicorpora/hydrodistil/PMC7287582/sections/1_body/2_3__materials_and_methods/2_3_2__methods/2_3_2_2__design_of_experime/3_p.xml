<p>The input variables considered as significant operating conditions were boiler occupancy rate, distillation duration, and particle size, coded as X
 <sub>1</sub>, X
 <sub>2</sub>, and X
 <sub>3</sub>. The boiler occupancy rate was varied between 50% and 100%, the distillation duration was continued between 60 and 90 min, and the herbs were cut to particle sizes between 10 and 30 mm via guillotine. Each independent variable was evaluated at three different coded levels: low, middle, and high, coded as 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and their values (under the uncoded and coded form) are given in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-02399-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>. The dependent variable as the system response selected in the Boxâ€“Wilson design was the essential oil volume obtained (mL) coded as Y, its constraint being listed in
