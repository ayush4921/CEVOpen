0: The input variables considered as significant operating conditions were boiler occupancy rate, distillation duration, and particle size, coded as X 1, X 2, and X 3.
1: The boiler occupancy rate was varied between 50% and 100%, the distillation duration was continued between 60 and 90 min, and the herbs were cut to particle sizes between 10 and 30 mm via guillotine.
2: Each independent variable was evaluated at three different coded levels: low, middle, and high, coded as 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and their values (under the uncoded and coded form) are given in  Table 6.
3: The dependent variable as the system response selected in the BoxWilson design was the essential oil volume obtained (mL) coded as Y, its constraint being listed in  Table 6.
