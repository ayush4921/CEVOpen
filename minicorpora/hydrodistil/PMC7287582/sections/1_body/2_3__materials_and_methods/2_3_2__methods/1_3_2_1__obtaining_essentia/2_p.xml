<p>The distillation equipment consisted of 4 units, 2 active and 2 passive. When the active units were distilled, passive units were ready for distillation by discharging, cleaning, and filling. When the duration of the distillation of the active units reached the end, they were replaced by passive units and thus 24/7 continuous distillation was possible. Each distillation unit was 3 m high and had 500 L of water capacity. Water used in distillation was free of lime and heavy metals. With the automation program used, the parameters such as pressure, temperature, and time, which are exposed to the oiled plant during the distillation, were recorded and could be traced backwards. Low temperature (98 °C) and water vapor pressure (1 bar) were used to keep the quality and yield of volatile oil high. Furthermore, the water vapor (101 °C) was directed through the gap between the two walls to prevent the inner wall from being cooled, evaporated, and condensed repeatedly and consequently to prevent deterioration of essential oil quality.</p>
