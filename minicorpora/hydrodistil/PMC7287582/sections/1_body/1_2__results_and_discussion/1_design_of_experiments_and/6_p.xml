<p>The above reduced quadratic polynomial equation was assessed through the determination coefficient (R
 <sup>2</sup>), correlation coefficient (R), analysis of variance (ANOVA), and residual analysis, respectively. The R
 <sup>2</sup> value of 0.9948 was higher than 0.90, while R value was 0.9974, closed to 1. ANOVA results proved the statistical significance of the regressional model, the value for the model probability being smaller than &lt;0.0001. The results of the residual analysis are listed in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-02399-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. All these results indicated a good predictive power of the reduced regressional equation. The summary of variance analysis is presented in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-02399-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, indicating the statistical significance of the regression model.
