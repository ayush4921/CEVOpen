<p>In Equation (1) only the significant terms (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) were considered and indicate the interaction and quadratic effects of the extraction process operating conditions on the essential oil volume (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-02399-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The regressional coefficient values in the above equation explain their influence on the selected response. For a response that has to be maximized according to the constraint from Table 6, a positive sign means a synergistic effect while a negative sign means an antagonistic effect of the corresponding input variables. Thus, the coefficients of the reduced model in Equation (1) show that for X
 <sub>3</sub> a positive linear effect is noticed, while for both quadratic forms of X
 <sub>2</sub> and X
 <sub>3</sub> a negative effect appears. The essential oil volume is positively influenced by the interaction between X
 <sub>1</sub> and X
 <sub>2</sub>.
