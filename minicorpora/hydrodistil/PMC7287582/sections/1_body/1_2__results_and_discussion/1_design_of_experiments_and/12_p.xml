<p>Taking into consideration all remarks above, we could conclude that the optimum variation levels for operating parameters in the extraction process of the essential oil from 
 <italic>Myrtus communis</italic> L. herbs are as follows: X
 <sub>1</sub>: [70 รท 100] %, X
 <sub>2</sub>: [70 รท 90] min, X
 <sub>3</sub>: [10 รท 20] mm. It seems that a higher boiler occupancy rate and duration of distillation conduct an increase of the essential oil volume, while the same effect is recorded for smaller particle size of the leaves.
