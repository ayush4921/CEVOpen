<p>From 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-02399-f002">Figure 2</xref>a,b it is determined that the best values for the essential oil volume are obtained for a higher boiler occupancy rate. Thus, an increase of 171.10% for the essential oil volume (from 275 mL to 745 mL) was recorded when the boiler occupancy rate varied from minimum to maximum levels and the duration of distillation was kept at the minimum level. For the duration of the distillation increase from the minimum to the maximum level when the boiler occupancy rate was at the maximum level, the essential oil volume increased only 4.11% (from 730 mL to 760 mL). A similar dependency was recorded for the influence of the boiler occupancy rate and the particle size on the essential oil volume (
