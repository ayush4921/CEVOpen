<p>Using the Taguchi technique, a combination of the operating parameters belonging to the initial fractional factorial design was selected (
 <italic>Run 10</italic>). The response obtained did not have the biggest value (see 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-02399-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) but was the most robust, stable, and insensitive to the noise factors. For this experiment, close values are obtained for the S/N ratio between the predictive value (58.42 dB) and the experimental one (57.50 dB).
