0: Thus, the aim of this study was to select the optimal operating conditions in order to obtain high volumes of essential oils using a BoxWilson factorial design complemented with response surface analysis and the Taguchi approach.
1: This optimization method was successfully applied by the authors in the field of drug delivery systems to get the best values for the physicalchemical and biopharmaceutical parameters, as well as the most stable, robust, and insensitive to the noise factor responses [ 33, 34, 35, 36].
2: To the best of our knowledge, in this study we investigated for the first time at an industrial scale the effect of major process variables (boiler occupancy rate, distillation time, and size of particles) on the volume of essential oil extracted from  Myrthus communis L. herbs by steam distillation.
