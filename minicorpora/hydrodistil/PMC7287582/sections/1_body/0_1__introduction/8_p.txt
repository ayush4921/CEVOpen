0: Zermane et al., found that the supercritical fluid extraction (SCCO 2) process used to obtain essential oils from the Algerian myrtle leaves resulted in the maximum yield of 4.89 wt% for a temperature of 313 K, pressure of 30 Mpa, and the lowest mean particle diameter [ 28].
1: Perreira et al., showed that the optimum experimental conditions resulting in a high yield of essential oil from Portugal myrtle leaves, using the same supercritical CO 2 extraction method, refers to a pressure of 22 MPa, temperature of 51 C, and SCCO 2 flow rate of 0.1 kg/h [ 29].
2: Haj Ammar et al., studied the influence of three technological parameters involved in the hydrodistillation process on essential oil yield extracted from Tunisian myrtle leaves, and found that the ratio of vegetal material weight/water weight and the condensation flow had the most significant effect while the ultrasound exposure time effect can be neglected [ 30].
3: In another study by Haj Ammar et al., a wider screening design was used to find the best conditions for a higher extraction yield also from Tunisia myrtle leaves.
4: In this case, the results indicated that the yield is mostly influenced by processing time, condensation flow, and the mass ratio of plant material:water, while the granulometry had a less important effect [ 31].
5: Ghasemi et al., performed a more complex study, analyzing the results for the essential oil yield obtained from Iranian myrtle leaves by two extraction techniques: supercritical fluid extraction using different operating conditions and hydrodistillation methods, concluding that the first method led to the best results [ 32].
