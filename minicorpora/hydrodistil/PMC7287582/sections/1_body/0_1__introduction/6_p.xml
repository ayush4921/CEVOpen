<p>Taking into account these therapeutic properties of myrtle essential oil, one of the top subjects in the essential oil industry is to obtain both high extracted volumes and optimal conditions of extraction with reduction of experimental trials [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-25-02399" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The recent studies showed the use of response surface methodology (RSM) as effective and powerful statistical method to optimize the essential oils extraction. For example, RSM was applied to determine at the laboratory scale the optimum extraction parameters to obtain high volumes of essential oil from 
 <italic>Citrus latifolia</italic> by distilling peels [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-25-02399" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and high yields of essential oil from 
 <italic>Cyperus rotundus</italic> Linn. rhizomes [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-25-02399" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], 
 <italic>Piper betle</italic> L. fresh and cured leaves [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-25-02399" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and 
 <italic>Pistacia lentiscus</italic> ripe berries [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-25-02399" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Moreover, Taguchi orthogonal array design was used to optimize the essential oil extraction yield from aerial parts of 
 <italic>Dracocephalum kotschyi Boiss</italic> [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-25-02399" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The essential oils extraction process from 
 <italic>Cymbopogon martinii</italic> (Palmarosa) leaves was studied by the Taguchi method combined with grey relational analysis [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-25-02399" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The same Taguchi experimental design was applied to extract biodiesel from 
 <italic>Manilkara zapota</italic> L. seed oil [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-25-02399" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].
