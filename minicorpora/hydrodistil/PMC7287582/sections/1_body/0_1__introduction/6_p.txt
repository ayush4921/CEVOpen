0: Taking into account these therapeutic properties of myrtle essential oil, one of the top subjects in the essential oil industry is to obtain both high extracted volumes and optimal conditions of extraction with reduction of experimental trials [ 20].
1: The recent studies showed the use of response surface methodology (RSM) as effective and powerful statistical method to optimize the essential oils extraction.
2: For example, RSM was applied to determine at the laboratory scale the optimum extraction parameters to obtain high volumes of essential oil from  Citrus latifolia by distilling peels [ 21], and high yields of essential oil from  Cyperus rotundus Linn.
3: rhizomes [ 22],  Piper betle L. fresh and cured leaves [ 23], and  Pistacia lentiscus ripe berries [ 24].
4: Moreover, Taguchi orthogonal array design was used to optimize the essential oil extraction yield from aerial parts of  Dracocephalum kotschyi Boiss [ 25].
5: The essential oils extraction process from  Cymbopogon martinii (Palmarosa) leaves was studied by the Taguchi method combined with grey relational analysis [ 26].
6: The same Taguchi experimental design was applied to extract biodiesel from  Manilkara zapota L. seed oil [ 27].
