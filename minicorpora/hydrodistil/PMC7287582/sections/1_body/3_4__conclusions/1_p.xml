<p>In order to obtain high volumes of myrtle essential oils a Box–Wilson factorial design was applied to evaluate at an industrial scale the effect of major process variables on the essential oil extraction from 
 <italic>Myrtus communis</italic> L. herbs by the steam distillation method. The steps of the classical statistical experimental design technique were complemented with the Taguchi method to improve the quality of the extraction process of essential oil from 
 <italic>Myrtus communis</italic> L., and the optimum parameter conditions were selected as follows: boiler occupancy rate 100%, distillation duration 75 min, and particle size 20 mm. Following the optimum parameters, the GC-MS assay revealed for the 
 <italic>Myrtus communis</italic> L. essential oil two predominant components, α-pinene—33.14% and eucalyptol—55.09%.
