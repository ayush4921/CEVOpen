<p>The essential oils from different cultivars of 
 <italic>B. sacra</italic> were obtained through a hydrodistillation method using Clevenger-type apparatus. A total of 250 g of finely grounded frankincense oleogum resin was added to 2500 mL distilled water in a 5000 mL bottom flask placed in a heating mantle. Hydrodistillation was performed under atmospheric pressure at boiling temperature (about 100 °C) using a closed steam jacket. Following two hours of hydrodistillation, a Grade 1 essential oil of each oleogum resin was collected, whereas Grade 2 and Grade 3 essential oils were collected after 4 and 6 h of successive distillation of the same resin sample. Therefore, a total of nine gum resin essential oils were obtained. The resulted essential oils were collected, dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate, and kept in a dark glass bottle at 4° C until analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS).
