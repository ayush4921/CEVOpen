0: The essential oils from different cultivars of  B. sacra were obtained through a hydrodistillation method using Clevenger-type apparatus.
1: A total of 250 g of finely grounded frankincense oleogum resin was added to 2500 mL distilled water in a 5000 mL bottom flask placed in a heating mantle.
2: Hydrodistillation was performed under atmospheric pressure at boiling temperature (about 100 C) using a closed steam jacket.
3: Following two hours of hydrodistillation, a Grade 1 essential oil of each oleogum resin was collected, whereas Grade 2 and Grade 3 essential oils were collected after 4 and 6 h of successive distillation of the same resin sample.
4: Therefore, a total of nine gum resin essential oils were obtained.
5: The resulted essential oils were collected, dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate, and kept in a dark glass bottle at 4 C until analyzed by gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GC-MS).
