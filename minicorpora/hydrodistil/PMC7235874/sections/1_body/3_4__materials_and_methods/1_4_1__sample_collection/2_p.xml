<p>The sample named Najdi was obtained from a plateau behind the Dhofar Mountains, where a rapid decline in rainfall and moisture was noted in this region. At the same time, temperature variances rise and desert weather changes the climate of the plain, including the southern slopes. Though annual rainfall in the Jebel region ranges from 500â€“750 mm, precipitation in the Nejd is recorded only in traces. The sample named Sahli was obtained from valleys (Shabi) of the Dhofar region. The normal annual precipitation is around 110 mm but can be from 70 to 360 mm. July to August is usually the rainy period. The sample Houjri is from Jebel Samhan of the Dhofar region. The Jebel hill range forms a distinct agro-climatic region. Thick fogs are detained back through ranges from inner desert areas. Precipitation is predominantly high and it can be from 600 to 700 mm, the highest in the country, which supports an enduring flora cover.</p>
