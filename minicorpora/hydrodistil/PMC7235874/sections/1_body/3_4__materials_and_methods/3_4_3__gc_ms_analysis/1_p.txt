0: GC/MS analysis of obtained essential oils was carried out by using a Thermo Scientific DSQ II single quadrupole system of an EI (electron ionization) type, employed in full scan.
1: The temperatures of the injector and ion source were 265 C and 260 C, respectively.
2: The capillary column was a ZB-WAX (30 m x 0.25 mm i.e., film breadth 0.25 m, (Phenomenex, Italy)).
3: The temperature of the oven was set and the column temperature started at 50 C, was raised at 3 C/min to 250 C, and after that a second gradient was used to 300 C at 40 C per minute, which was then seized for 3 min under isothermal conditions.
4: The flow rate of helium, the carrier gas, was 1 mL/min.
5: A sample of 1L was inoculated with a split ratio of 1:100.
6: The temperature of the ion source was 260 C, the temperature of the MSn transfer line was 265 C and the temperature of the injector was 270 C. Ionization voltage was 70 eV and the mass range scanned was 35550  m/ z.
7: Each oil component was identified on the basis of its retention index, relative to C8-C36 n-alkanes, from MS library searches using the NIST and Wiley GC-MS databases, and by comparison with mass spectral data in the literature.
