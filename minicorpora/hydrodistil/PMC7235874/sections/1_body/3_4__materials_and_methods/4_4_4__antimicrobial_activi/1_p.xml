<p>The MICs of essential oils for seven reference bacterial strains (two strains of 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (ATCC 25923; ATCC 6538), two reference strains of 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (ATCC 15442; ATCC 9027) and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> ATCC 12228, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus hominis</italic> ATCC 27844, and 
 <italic>Propionibacterium acnes</italic> ATCC 11827) were defined by means of an already described technique for a dilution antimicrobial susceptibility test for bacteria that grow aerobically (CLSI), with few amendments [
 <xref rid="B18-antibiotics-09-00195" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Concisely, 0.1 mL of essential oil was mixed with 0.1mL of culture medium (Mueller Hinton broth, Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy) present in a well of a sterile 96-wells plate, and a 1:2 dilution series with broth medium was performed. A growth control and a negative sterile well control was included for each plate. A bacterial suspension (10 µL) from a suspension in NaCl 0.9% of isolated clusters, preferred from a 18 to 24 h agar plate and attuned to get a turbidity equivalent to a 0.5 McFarland standard, was added into the wells and the final test concentration of bacteria was approximately 5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU/mL bacterial. The 96-well plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h and MICs were read by a microplate spectrophotometer (GloMax
 <sup>®</sup>-Multi Detection System, Promega Italia s.r.l, Milan, Italy) as the lowest concentration of the sample that fully suppresses bacterial growth in the microdilution wells and whose optical density (OD) at 570 nm is comparable to OD values of negative control wells (only medium, without inoculum).
