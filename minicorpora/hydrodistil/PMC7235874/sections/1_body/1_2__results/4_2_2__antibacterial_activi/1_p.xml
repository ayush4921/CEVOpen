<p>All the essential oils from the different frankincense cultivars were tested against two relevant pathogens, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, included in the global priority list of antibiotic-resistant bacteria from WHO/OMS [
 <xref rid="B12-antibiotics-09-00195" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and against some reference strains of dermatological interest: 
 <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> ATCC 12228, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus hominis</italic> ATCC 27,844 and 
 <italic>Propionibacterium acnes</italic> ATCC 11827. The results are expressed in terms of minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) in percentage 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic> or in mg/mL and are reported in 
 <xref rid="antibiotics-09-00195-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The results indicate that Grade 2 essential oil of Najdi showed an MIC of 52 mg/mL for 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCC 6538, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> ATCC 9027 and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> ATCC15442. The essential oil of Grade 2 Sahli was active against all reference strains of 
 <italic>S.aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, with MIC values ranging from 440 to 110 mg/mL. It showed the best MIC values, ranging from 6.16 to 0.264 mg/mL, against bacterial strains of dermatological interest 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>, 
 <italic>S. hominis</italic> and 
 <italic>P. acnes</italic>.
