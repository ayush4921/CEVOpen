<p>In 
 <xref rid="antibiotics-09-00195-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, the essential oil yields from three different frankincense gum cultivars, called Najdi, Sahli and Houjri, are shown. The samples were subjected to three successive hydrodistillations (2, 4, 6 h) to obtain three corresponding essential oils that were called Grade 1, Grade 2 and Grade 3. The essential oils from 
 <italic>B. sacra</italic> oleogum resins were obtained in yields of 8.92–12% (

 <italic>w</italic>), followed by Sahli, of 2.08% (

 <italic>w</italic>) of essential oils (

 <italic>B. sacra</italic> oleo gum resin are comparable to a previous study [
