 <italic>B. sacra</italic> essential oil indicates α-pinene as its primary component. α-Pinene has been found to be one of the integral components of many other antimicrobial essential oils, and thus can be inferred as one of the main players in the antimicrobial activity of

Moreover, the occurrence of drug resistance towards an essential oil in a microorganism is very rare because of its multicomponent nature that necessitates modification of numerous targets [
