<p>Data presented in 
 <xref rid="antibiotics-09-00195-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> clearly indicate that there are major differences in the composition of the essential oils of three studied cultivars. All three grades of resin sample gave the highest value for α-pinene, similar findings reported by already mentioned authors [
 <xref rid="B11-antibiotics-09-00195" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and a comparable range for α-pinene was noted in different fractions of the essential oil of 
 <italic>B. sacra</italic> [
 <xref rid="B13-antibiotics-09-00195" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The percentage of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes reported for the Grade 1 essential oil of Najdi showed similar values as reported for 
 <italic>Boswellia serrata</italic> [
 <xref rid="B14-antibiotics-09-00195" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, there is a major difference in the values recorded for α-pinene in this study, which was 79.59%, while only 5.3% was reported for 
 <italic>B. serrata</italic> [
 <xref rid="B15-antibiotics-09-00195" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].
