<p>A previous article on four essential oils from different 
 <italic>Boswellia</italic> species showed a significant activity against 
 <italic>Candida tropicalis</italic> and 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> [
 <xref rid="B16-antibiotics-09-00195" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In our study we found that all tested samples showed an interesting antifungal activity against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>M. furfur</italic> with MIC values ranging from 27.28 to 0.240 mg/mL. A high percentage of Î±-pinene in all Grade 1 essential oils (and in general in monoterpenes) could explain the activity against tested fungal pathogens. Our findings could enable the use of frankincense oil blends in many fields, such as starting products for dermatological bacterial and fungal infections treatments.
