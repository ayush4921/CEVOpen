<p>Concerning the antimicrobial activity, it was interesting to note that both 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> tested strains were susceptible to most of the essential oils obtained from the three different cultivars. As there are not many antimicrobials concurrently active against the above-mentioned pathogens, these results are relevant because there is a pressing demand for effective antimicrobials towards these microorganisms present on the WHO/OMS priority bacteria list. Therefore, tested essential oils could be a source for new anti-staphylococcal and anti-pseudomonal molecules. Grade 2 of Sahli showed a MIC at 0.264 mg/mL for 
 <italic>P. acnes</italic>, an important pathogen of dermatologic relevance. The activity could be explained by a higher concentration of sesquiterpenes in the extracts obtained by subsequent hydrodistillation of 4 h.
