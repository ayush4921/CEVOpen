<p>Following the characterization of the antibiotic-modulating activity, the CcEO was tested against two Gram-negative bacteria (
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>) and one Gram-positive strain (
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>). Our data indicate that the oil has stronger activity against Gram-negative bacteria. Interestingly, these strains have a natural drug resistance profile due to the lipopolysaccharide layer, which hinders the permeability of these substances. Our tests demonstrated that the CcEO potentiated the action of gentamicin and norfloxacin, which act within the bacterial cell, suggesting that 
 <italic>C. ceanothifolius</italic> essential oil facilitated the permeability of these drugs to the bacterial cytoplasm [
