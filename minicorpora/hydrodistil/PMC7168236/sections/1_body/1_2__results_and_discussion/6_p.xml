<p>The association of 188 µL of the essential oil with gentamicin caused a synergistic effect against all strains tested. The MIC of this antibiotic was reduced from 128 to 50 µg/mL against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and from 32 to 16 µg/mL against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> tests. In tests with 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> CcEO decreased gentamicin MIC from 16 µg/mL to 12 µg/mL, but in this case, there was no statistical difference. Accordingly, Vidal et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-antibiotics-09-00027" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] demonstrated that 
 <italic>C. rhamnifolioides</italic> essential oil reduced gentamicin MIC against multidrug-resistant 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> strains. In addition, Da costa et al. [
 <xref rid="B9-antibiotics-09-00027" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] found that 
 <italic>C. rhamnifolioides</italic> essential oil exhibits antibacterial activity against Gram-positive strains. 
 <italic>C. zehntneri</italic> also showed modifying the effect of antibiotic action against strains of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> [
 <xref rid="B22-antibiotics-09-00027" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. These studies corroborate the data obtained in the present research and highlight the genus 
 <italic>Croton</italic> for its antibacterial potential.
