 <italic>C. ceanothifolius</italic> essential oil. Analyzing the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of CcEO against multidrug resistant bacteria, we found values greater than 1024 Âµg/mL against all strains evaluated, indicating that the oil did not present clinically relevant antibacterial activity. A similar result was obtained by Leite et al. [
