<p>Compared to data in the literature, these results suggest that species of the genus 
 <italic>Croton</italic> may have similar chemical compositions. Studies on 
 <italic>C. pallidulus</italic>, 
 <italic>C. isabelli</italic>, 
 <italic>C. ericoides</italic> [
 <xref rid="B14-antibiotics-09-00027" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], 
 <italic>C. argyrophylloides</italic>, and 
 <italic>C. sincorensis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B15-antibiotics-09-00027" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] showed a predominance of sesquiterpenes as found in 
 <italic>C. ceanothifolius</italic> essential oil. Moreover, these species presented the same major components, indicating that the relative composition of the constituents can also be conserved among the species of this genus. Importantly, Souza et al. [
 <xref rid="B15-antibiotics-09-00027" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] proved that climate variation affects the production of secondary metabolites since the concentration of specific metabolites varied as a function of seasonality. The genus 
 <italic>Croton</italic> has been widely investigated in several areas of biology. However, the species 
 <italic>C. ceanothifolius</italic> remains poorly studied. Thus, this study is a pioneer in the chemical characterization and identification of the pharmacological activity of this species.
