<p>On the other hand, CcEO failed to modulate penicillin activity under all conditions tested, suggesting an effect that is related to the mechanism of action of this antibiotic. In this case, bacterial resistance is caused by the action of β-lactamases, enzymes that hydrolyze the functional component of penicillin-class drugs. Many bacteria today have acquired this resistance mechanism mainly due to the indiscriminate use of these antibiotics [
 <xref rid="B24-antibiotics-09-00027" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Here, we suggest that while CcEO has facilitated drug entry (due to increased permeability), penicillinases continue to degrade its β-lactam ring, causing enzymatic inactivation.
