 <italic>C. ceanothifolius</italic> essential oil does not have clinically relevant antibacterial activity but has a significant modifying effect on the antibacterial action of some drugs, potentiating their effects against multiresistant bacteria. This is the first study to report the pharmacological properties of this species and, therefore, further studies are fundamental to determine the constituents as well as the mechanisms involved in modulating antibiotic resistance exerted by
