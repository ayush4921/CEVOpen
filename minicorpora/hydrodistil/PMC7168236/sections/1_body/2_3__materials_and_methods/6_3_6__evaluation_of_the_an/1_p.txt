0: Volumes of 100 L of each antibiotic at a concentration of 1024 g/mL were serially diluted in wells containing 10% BHI and suspensions of the multidrug resistant inocula and essential oil at a subinhibitory concentration (MIC/8) [ 29].
1: Controls were prepared by using 1350 L of 10% BHI medium and 150 L of the inoculum.
2: Each well of a microdilution plate was filled with 100 L of the oil or control solution.
3: Following this procedure, serial dilutions with 100 L the antibiotics at concentrations ranging between 512 and 0.5 g/mL were carried out.
4: The plates were incubated in an oven at 35 C for 24 h, and then the MIC of these antibiotics in the presence of the essential oil was determined by the addition of resazurin and interpreted as described above.
