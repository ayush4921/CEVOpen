<p>Volumes of 100 µL of each antibiotic at a concentration of 1024 µg/mL were serially diluted in wells containing 10% BHI and suspensions of the multidrug resistant inocula and essential oil at a subinhibitory concentration (MIC/8) [
 <xref rid="B29-antibiotics-09-00027" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Controls were prepared by using 1350 µL of 10% BHI medium and 150 µL of the inoculum. Each well of a microdilution plate was filled with 100 µL of the oil or control solution. Following this procedure, serial dilutions with 100 µL the antibiotics at concentrations ranging between 512 and 0.5 μg/mL were carried out. The plates were incubated in an oven at 35 °C for 24 h, and then the MIC of these antibiotics in the presence of the essential oil was determined by the addition of resazurin and interpreted as described above.
