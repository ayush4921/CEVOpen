<p>Bacterial strains were seeded in Petri dishes containing Heart Infusion Agar (HIA) and kept in the oven at 37 °C for 24 h for growth. After this time, an aliquot of the culture was diluted in test tubes containing sterile saline in triplicate to obtain inocula. The turbidity of the solution was compared to a 0.5 McFarland scale control. A volume of 100 μL of each inoculum (corresponding to 10% of the total solution) was added to a tube containing 900 μL of 10% Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) [
 <xref rid="B27-antibiotics-09-00027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and then, 100 μL of these solutions were transferred to 96-well plates. The volume of each well was supplemented with 100 μL of the essential oil added after serial dilution at concentrations ranging from 512 μg/mL to 8 μg/mL. All treatments were performed in triplicate.
