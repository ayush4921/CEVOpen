0: Bacterial strains were seeded in Petri dishes containing Heart Infusion Agar (HIA) and kept in the oven at 37 C for 24 h for growth.
1: After this time, an aliquot of the culture was diluted in test tubes containing sterile saline in triplicate to obtain inocula.
2: The turbidity of the solution was compared to a 0.5 McFarland scale control.
3: A volume of 100 L of each inoculum (corresponding to 10% of the total solution) was added to a tube containing 900 L of 10% Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) [ 27] and then, 100 L of these solutions were transferred to 96-well plates.
4: The volume of each well was supplemented with 100 L of the essential oil added after serial dilution at concentrations ranging from 512 g/mL to 8 g/mL.
5: All treatments were performed in triplicate.
