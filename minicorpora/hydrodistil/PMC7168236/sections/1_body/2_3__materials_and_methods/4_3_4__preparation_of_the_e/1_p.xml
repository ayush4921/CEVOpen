Soon after the first dilution, this solution was transferred to a falcon tube and an additional 8.765 mL of sterile distilled water added, making a total of 9.765 mL of solution to a concentration of 1024 µg/mL. This solution was used for minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) tests and evaluation of the antibiotic-modulating activity in association with Norfloxacin (quinolone), Penicillin (penicillin) and Gentamycin (aminoglycoside) at an initial concentration of 1024 μg/mL.
