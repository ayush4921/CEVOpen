<p>The chemical composition of the oil was analyzed by Gas Chromatography coupled to Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS). The essential oil was diluted in dichloromethane at a rate of 1% and injected in an Agilent 6890 (Palo Alto, CA, USA) chromatograph coupled to an Agilent 5973 N selective mass detector. The injector was kept at 250 °C. The separation of the constituents was obtained by HP-5MS capillary column (5%-phenyl-95%-dimethylpolysiloxane, 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) and using helium as carrier gas (1.0 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup>). The oven temperature was set at 60 to 240 °C at a rate of 3 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup>. The mass detector was operated in electronic ionization mode (70 eV) at a rate of 3.15 scan
 <sup>−1</sup> and mass range from 40 to 450 u. The transfer line was maintained at 260 °C, the ion source at 230 °C and the analyzer (quadrupole) at 150 °C.
