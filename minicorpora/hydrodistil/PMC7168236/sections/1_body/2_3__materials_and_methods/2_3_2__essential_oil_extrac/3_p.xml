<p>For quantification, the diluted sample was injected into an Agilent 7890 A chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID), operating at 280 °C and employing the same column and analytical conditions described above, except for the carrier gas used, which was hydrogen, at a flow rate of 1.5 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup>. The percentage composition was obtained by the electronic integration of the FID signal by dividing the area of each component by the total area (area%). Identification of components was performed by comparing their mass spectra with the standards reported in the literature [
