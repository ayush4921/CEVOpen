0: The chemical composition of the oil was analyzed by Gas Chromatography coupled to Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS).
1: The essential oil was diluted in dichloromethane at a rate of 1% and injected in an Agilent 6890 (Palo Alto, CA, USA) chromatograph coupled to an Agilent 5973 N selective mass detector.
2: The injector was kept at 250 C. The separation of the constituents was obtained by HP-5MS capillary column (5%-phenyl-95%-dimethylpolysiloxane, 30 m  0.25 mm  0.25 m) and using helium as carrier gas (1.0 mL min 1).
3: The oven temperature was set at 60 to 240 C at a rate of 3 C min 1.
4: The mass detector was operated in electronic ionization mode (70 eV) at a rate of 3.15 scan 1 and mass range from 40 to 450 u.
5: The transfer line was maintained at 260 C, the ion source at 230 C and the analyzer (quadrupole) at 150 C.
