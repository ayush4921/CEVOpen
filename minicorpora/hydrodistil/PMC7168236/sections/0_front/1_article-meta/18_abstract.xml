 <p>This study is a pioneer in reporting the antibacterial properties of the species 
  <italic>Croton ceanothifolius</italic> Baill. The genus 
  <italic>Croton</italic> belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae composed of numerous species with documented biological activities. However, the pharmacological properties of 
  <italic>C. ceanothifolius</italic> remain poorly understood. The leaves of this plant were submitted to hydrodistillation for essential oil (CcEO) extraction and the phytochemical characterization of the oil was performed by GC/MS. The minimum inhibitory concentration of the CcEO was determined for the evaluation of antibacterial activity against multiresistant strains of 
  <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
  <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa,</italic> and 
  <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. The antibiotic-modulating activity of the oil, in combination with antibiotics, was also evaluated. The combination of the CcEO with penicillin, norfloxacin, and gentamicin presented a synergistic effect. This effect was more significant for the association with antibiotics of the quinolone and aminoglycoside classes against 
  <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. The association of oil with gentamicin showed better results with regard to the Gram-positive strain. The association of the oil with norfloxacin against 
  <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> also showed synergism, but the association with penicillin did not change the effect of this antibiotic. Thus, it is concluded that 
  <italic>C. ceanothifolius</italic> essential oil selectively potentiates the action of antibiotics against multiresistant strains.
