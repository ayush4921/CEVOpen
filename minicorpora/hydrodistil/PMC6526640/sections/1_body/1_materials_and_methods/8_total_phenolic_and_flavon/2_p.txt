0: To determine the total polyphenol content, 0.5 ml of the sample extract was mixed with 2 ml of FolinCiocalteu's reagent.
1: After 5 min, 2.5 ml of 7.5% Na 2CO 3 solution was added, and the mixture was incubated for 90 min in the dark.
2: The reaction mixture absorbance was measured at 760 nm, and the reaction mixture without the sample was used as a blank.
3: Gallic acid was chosen as a standard, and a 6point standard curve was prepared (050 mg/L).
4: The TPC of the plant extract was expressed as gallic acid equivalents (mg GA/g) for dry powder (Riahi et al.,  2013; Singleton & Rosi,  1965).
5: All samples were analyzed in duplicate.
