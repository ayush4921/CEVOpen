<p>To determine the total polyphenol content, 0.5 ml of the sample extract was mixed with 2 ml of Folin–Ciocalteu's reagent. After 5 min, 2.5 ml of 7.5% Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3 </sub>solution was added, and the mixture was incubated for 90 min in the dark. The reaction mixture absorbance was measured at 760 nm, and the reaction mixture without the sample was used as a blank. Gallic acid was chosen as a standard, and a 6‐point standard curve was prepared (0–50 mg/L). The TPC of the plant extract was expressed as gallic acid equivalents (mg GA/g) for dry powder (Riahi et al.,
