0: To determine the TFC, 1 ml of diluted plant extract was mixed with 1 ml of 2% AlCl 3 methanolic solution.
1: After incubation at room temperature for 15 min, the absorbance of the reaction mixture was measured at 430 nm.
2: Quercetin was chosen as a standard, and a standard curve was prepared (050 mg/L).
3: The TFC was expressed as mg quercetin equivalents/g for dry weight (Djeridane et al.,  2006; Riahi et al.,  2013).
4: All samples were analyzed in duplicate.
