<p>To determine the TFC, 1 ml of diluted plant extract was mixed with 1 ml of 2% AlCl
 <sub>3</sub> methanolic solution. After incubation at room temperature for 15 min, the absorbance of the reaction mixture was measured at 430 nm. Quercetin was chosen as a standard, and a standard curve was prepared (0–50 mg/L). The TFC was expressed as mg quercetin equivalents/g for dry weight (Djeridane et al.,
