<p>The ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay was conducted according to Riahi et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31007-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). The FRAP reagent was freshly prepared by mixing acetate buffer (300 mM, pH 3.6), TPTZ solution (10 mM TPTZ in 40 mM HCl), and FeCl
 <sub>3</sub>·6H
 <sub>2</sub>O (20 mM) in a ratio of 10:1:1 (v:v:v). To carry out the assay, 900 µl of FRAP reagent, 90 µl distilled water, and 30 µl of plant extract or oil were mixed. After incubation at 37°C for 15 min, the absorbance was measured at 595 nm, using the FRAP solution as a blank. The antioxidant capacity of plant extracts or oil was determined from a standard curve plotted using the FeSO
 <sub>4</sub>·7H
 <sub>2</sub>O linear regression. Results were expressed as µM of Fe
 <sup>+2</sup>/g of essential oil or dry extract. Tests were conducted in duplicate.
