0: The ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay was conducted according to Riahi et al.
1: ( 2013).
2: The FRAP reagent was freshly prepared by mixing acetate buffer (300 mM, pH 3.6), TPTZ solution (10 mM TPTZ in 40 mM HCl), and FeCl 36H 2O (20 mM) in a ratio of 10:1:1 (v:v:v).
3: To carry out the assay, 900 l of FRAP reagent, 90 l distilled water, and 30 l of plant extract or oil were mixed.
4: After incubation at 37C for 15 min, the absorbance was measured at 595 nm, using the FRAP solution as a blank.
5: The antioxidant capacity of plant extracts or oil was determined from a standard curve plotted using the FeSO 47H 2O linear regression.
6: Results were expressed as M of Fe +2/g of essential oil or dry extract.
7: Tests were conducted in duplicate.
