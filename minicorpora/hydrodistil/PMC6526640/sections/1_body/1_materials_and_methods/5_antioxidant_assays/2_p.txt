0: The 2,2diphenyl1picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging capacity was measured according to Cuendet, Hostettmann, and Potterat ( 1997).
1: Next, 50 l of either essential oil or plant extract (at different concentrations in methanol) was mixed with 5 ml of a 0.004% (w/v) DPPH methanolic solution.
2: The reaction was allowed to stand at room temperature for 30 min, and absorbance was read against a blank at 517 nm.
3: The inhibitions of the DPPH radical in percent were calculated as follows:  I (%) = ( Ablank   Asample/ Ablank)  100, where  Ablank is the absorbance of the control reaction (containing all reagents except the test sample), and  Asample is the absorbance value of the essential oil or the extract.
4: Extract or oil concentration providing 50% inhibition (IC 50) was calculated using the graphplotted inhibition percentage against the extract or oil concentration.
5: Tests were conducted in duplicate, with gallic acid used as a positive control.
