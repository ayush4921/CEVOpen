<p>Air‐dried plants of cultivated 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris </italic>and 
 <italic>Thymbra spicata </italic>were obtained from Diyarbakir Research Institute (July 2017), Turkey. A NEOS microwave extraction system (MA 125 Milestone, Italy) was used for this study. Seventy‐five grams of dry plant material was weighed into a beaker. Then, 150 ml of distilled water was added (1:2, w/v). After 30 min of resting, extraction was performed at 550 W power for 30 min. Then, the essential oil was collected and placed into vial with anhydrous sodium sulfate to remove any water. Then, vials were stored at 4°C for later analysis.
