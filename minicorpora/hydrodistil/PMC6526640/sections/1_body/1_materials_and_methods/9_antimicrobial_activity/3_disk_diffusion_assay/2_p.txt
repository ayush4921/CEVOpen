0: A disk diffusion assay was used to determine the antibacterial properties.
1: Essential oils of hydrodistillation (HD) and microwaveassisted extraction (MAE) along with methanol and ethanol extracts of  Thymus vulgaris and  Thymbra spicata were individually tested against six bacteria.
2: All the bacterial species were first inoculated into tryptic soy agar and incubated overnight at 37C.
3: After checking for purity, the bacteria were suspended in a 0.9% NaCl solution using a densitometer to adjust the final cell concentration to a 0.5 McFarland number (1  10 8 cfu/ml).
4: Then, 100 l of the bacterial suspensions was spread on MuellerHinton agar.
5: The 6mmdiameter, sterile, empty disks were either impregnated with 10 l essential oils, or 20 l of extracts was placed on the inoculated agar.
6: Empty standard antibiotic disks were used as a control.
7: The inoculated plates were incubated at 37C for 24 hr.
8: Antibacterial activity was determined by measuring the zone of inhibition in mm without including the radius of the disk.
