0: Two solvents were used to extract polar fractions of the  Thymus vulgaris and  Thymbra spicata.
1: Ten grams of sample was weighed into a beaker.
2: Then, either 100 ml of 80% aqueous methanol (1:10 ratio of w/v) or 100 ml of 80% aqueous ethanol (1:10 ratio of w/v) was measured and placed into the beaker and shaken for 30 min to provide even mixing.
3: Next, it was sonicated for 30 min, after which the slurry was filtered using a Buchner funnel, vacuum flask, and Whatman  no.
4: 1 filter paper.
5: With the filtered solution in the dark and under refrigeration, the sonication procedure was repeated two more times.
6: The collected filtrates were combined, and the liquid extract was placed into a 500ml roundbottom flask.
7: The aqueous methanol or aqueous ethanol solution was completely evaporated using a rotary evaporator at 50C.
8: Then, extracts were frozen at 80C and freezedried.
9: The dried extracts were stored in the dark for later analysis.
10: The proper amount of lyophilized extracts was dissolved in a 50% methanolic solution and filtered with a 0.45m filter before use in the HPLC procedure.
