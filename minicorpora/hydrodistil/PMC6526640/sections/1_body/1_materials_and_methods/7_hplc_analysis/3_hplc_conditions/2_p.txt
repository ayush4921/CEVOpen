0: A Waters model W2690/5 autosampler equipped with Waters 2,695 pumps and a Waters 2,489 UV detector was used for this study.
1: Separation was achieved using an ACE C 18 (5 m  4.6  250 mm) column (Advanced Chromatography Technologies Ltd., Aberdeen, Scotland).
2: The mobile phases consisted of (A) 2% acetic acid, (B) acetonitrile and 0.5% acetic acid solution (1:1, v/v), and (C) acetonitrile.
3: The column temperature was fixed at 25C, and the injection volume was 20 l. The flow rate was kept constant at 1.2 ml/min.
4: A gradient program with the following proportions of solvents was used: We started the flow of mobile phase A as 95% and B as 5% to 5 min; this gradually increased to 20%, 22%, 25%, 27%, 40%, 45%, and 65% at 5, 8, 10, 17, 19, 30, 35, and 40 min, respectively, for mobile phase B, while mobile phase A decreased.
5: Then, mobile phase B was reduced to 10% at 45 min, while mobile phase C increased to 90%.
6: During the next 5 min, mobile phase C was 100%, followed by a return to the initial conditions for 10 min.
7: The chromatographic peaks were identified based on their retention times and compared with the retention times of the authentic standards.
8: Phenolic compounds found in the plants were calculated based on the external standard curve of the standard compounds.
9: This analysis was carried out in duplicate.
