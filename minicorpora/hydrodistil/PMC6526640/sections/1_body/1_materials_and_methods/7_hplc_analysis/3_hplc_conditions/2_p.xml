<p>A Waters model W2690/5 autosampler equipped with Waters 2,695 pumps and a Waters 2,489 UV detector was used for this study. Separation was achieved using an ACE C
 <sub>18 </sub>(5 µm − 4.6 × 250 mm) column (Advanced Chromatography Technologies Ltd., Aberdeen, Scotland). The mobile phases consisted of (A) 2% acetic acid, (B) acetonitrile and 0.5% acetic acid solution (1:1, v/v), and (C) acetonitrile. The column temperature was fixed at 25°C, and the injection volume was 20 µl. The flow rate was kept constant at 1.2 ml/min. A gradient program with the following proportions of solvents was used: We started the flow of mobile phase A as 95% and B as 5% to 5 min; this gradually increased to 20%, 22%, 25%, 27%, 40%, 45%, and 65% at 5, 8, 10, 17, 19, 30, 35, and 40 min, respectively, for mobile phase B, while mobile phase A decreased. Then, mobile phase B was reduced to 10% at 45 min, while mobile phase C increased to 90%. During the next 5 min, mobile phase C was 100%, followed by a return to the initial conditions for 10 min. The chromatographic peaks were identified based on their retention times and compared with the retention times of the authentic standards. Phenolic compounds found in the plants were calculated based on the external standard curve of the standard compounds. This analysis was carried out in duplicate.
