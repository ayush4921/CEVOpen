<p>Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC‐MS) analysis of the essential oil was performed on a GC‐MS QP2020 equipped with an Rxi‐5Sil MS column (5% diphenyl‐95% dimethylpolysiloxane 30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., 
 <italic>df</italic> = 0.25 µm; RESTEK GC Columns, USA). The injector and detector temperatures were set at 250°C. Temperature programming of the oven included an initial hold at 40°C for 2 min and a rise to 240°C at 4°C/min and held for 53 min. Helium was the carrier gas, with a linear velocity of 43.4 cm/s. The samples were diluted with 
 <italic>n</italic>‐hexane (1:10, v/v), and a volume of 1.0 µl was injected into the GC with the injector in the split mode (split ratio: 1:25). The ionization voltage applied was 70 eV (electron volt), with a mass range 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z </italic>(mass‐to‐charge ratio) of 40–400 amu (atomic mass unit). The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), WILEY 7 mass spectral library data, and authentic standards were applied to match the separated components. Peak area integration was used for the determination of percentage of combination. This analysis was carried out in duplicate.
