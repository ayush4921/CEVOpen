0: Gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GCMS) analysis of the essential oil was performed on a GCMS QP2020 equipped with an Rxi5Sil MS column (5% diphenyl95% dimethylpolysiloxane 30 m  0.25 mm i.d.,  df = 0.25 m; RESTEK GC Columns, USA).
1: The injector and detector temperatures were set at 250C.
2: Temperature programming of the oven included an initial hold at 40C for 2 min and a rise to 240C at 4C/min and held for 53 min.
3: Helium was the carrier gas, with a linear velocity of 43.4 cm/s.
4: The samples were diluted with  nhexane (1:10, v/v), and a volume of 1.0 l was injected into the GC with the injector in the split mode (split ratio: 1:25).
5: The ionization voltage applied was 70 eV (electron volt), with a mass range  m/ z (masstocharge ratio) of 40400 amu (atomic mass unit).
6: The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), WILEY 7 mass spectral library data, and authentic standards were applied to match the separated components.
7: Peak area integration was used for the determination of percentage of combination.
8: This analysis was carried out in duplicate.
