<p>Few studies have investigated both the hydrophobic and the hydrophilic fractures of Lamiaceae family plants. This study provides a comprehensive investigation of both the essential oil and the plant extracts of two Lamiaceae family plants, 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris </italic>and 
 <italic>Thymbra spicata</italic>. This study was designed to compare hydrophobic and hydrophilic extracts of both species. Hydrophobic fractions (essential oils) were obtained by hydrodistillation (HD) and microwave‐assisted extraction (MAE). MAE is fast and extracts essential oils quickly, so research is needed to determine whether oil compositions are affected by this extraction method. For the same reason, hydrophilic nonvolatile fractions will be extracted with two common solvents, methanol and ethanol. Therefore, the objectives of this study were (a) to obtain the essential oils by hydrodistillation (HD) and microwave‐assisted extraction (MAE) and to determine the effect of the oil extraction method on the chemical composition, oil yield (%), free radical scavenging activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub>), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) value, and antimicrobial properties; and (b) to determine the effect of different solvents (i.e., methanol [80%] and ethanol [80%]) on extraction by means of the phenolic acid composition, total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), IC
 <sub>50</sub>, FRAP values, and antimicrobial properties of thyme and zahter.
