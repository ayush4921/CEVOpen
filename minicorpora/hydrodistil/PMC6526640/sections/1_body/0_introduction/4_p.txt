0: Recently, the food industry has endeavored to move toward the direction of clean labeling.
1: Therefore, removing synthetic preservatives, such as butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), from food formulations and replacing them with natural preservatives have gained significant importance.
2: Many plants have been investigated for wide variety of active components for antimicrobial and antioxidant properties.
3: Thyme and zahter could be useful plants due to their essential oils being high in thymol and carvacrol, respectively (Lee et al.,  2005; Uysal et al.,  2015), and also their extracts being rich in phenolic acids (Erturk et al.,  2017; Roby, Sarhan, Selim, & Khalel,  2013).
4: Phenolic acids, such as rosmarinic acid, have been studied for their antioxidant properties (Kostic et al.,  2015; Skendi et al.,  2017).
5: Development of food additives made from essential oils and/or extracts with antioxidant and antimicrobial properties is a crucial step toward clean labeling and the production of healthier food products.
