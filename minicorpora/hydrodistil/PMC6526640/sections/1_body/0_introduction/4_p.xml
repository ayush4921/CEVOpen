<p>Recently, the food industry has endeavored to move toward the direction of clean labeling. Therefore, removing synthetic preservatives, such as butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), from food formulations and replacing them with natural preservatives have gained significant importance. Many plants have been investigated for wide variety of active components for antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. Thyme and zahter could be useful plants due to their essential oils being high in thymol and carvacrol, respectively (Lee et al.,
