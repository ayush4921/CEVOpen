0: Especially in last two decades, great efforts have been made to identify and quantify the bioactive components of Lamiaceae family plants.
1: Essential oils of these plants are rich in thymol, carvacrol, pcymene, and terpinene (Golmakani & Rezaei,  2008; Lee et al.,  2005; Sokmen et al.,  2004; Tohidi, Rahimmalek, & Arzani,  2017).
2: It has been reported based on in vitro tests that essential oils and their chemical constituents, such as thymol and carvacrol, provide antimicrobial and antioxidant properties (Sokmen et al.,  2004; Uysal et al.,  2015), which have been used in active packaging (BallesterCosta, Sendra, FernandezLopez, & ViudaMartos,  2016; Ramos, Beltran, Peltzer, Valente, & Garrigos,  2014; Ramos, Jimenez, Peltzer, & Garrigos,  2012) and in surface sanitation applications on fresh produce and meat (Lu, Joerger, & Wu,  2014; Lu & Wu,  2010, 2012).
3: In addition to the essential oils of these plants, hydrophilic fractions also have been studied.
4: Research on extracts of L. family plant chemical has investigated their composition (Martins et al.,  2015; Pereira, Peres, Silva, Domingues, & Cardoso,  2013) as well as their antioxidant (Martins et al.,  2015; Skendi, Irakli, & Chatzopoulou,  2017) and antimicrobial properties (Erturk, Tanrikulu, Yavuz, Can, & Cakir,  2017; Fatma, Mouna, Mondher, & Ahmed,  2014).
