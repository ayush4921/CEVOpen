<p>This study provided a comprehensive investigation of hydrophilic and hydrophobic fractures of 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris </italic>and 
 <italic>Thymbra spicata </italic>for chemical composition, antioxidant activity, and antimicrobial activity. Concerning the extraction methodology for essential oils, microwave‐assisted extraction provided results comparable to hydrodistillation for the GC‐MS and antioxidant assays. To the best of our knowledge, the results of the FRAP assay for 
 <italic>Thymbra spicata </italic>essential oil are the first to be reported. Bioactive compounds, such as rosmarinic acid, were high in both methanol extracts of the plants. Also, methanol extracts provided significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) higher bioactive compounds than ethanol extracts, which also relates to their antioxidant activity, TPC, and TFC. Plant extracts did not provide antimicrobial activity; on the other hand, essential oils showed antimicrobial activity. Use of both extracts and essential oil in emulsions could provide antioxidant and antimicrobial activity for food preservation. Future studies should be performed to determine whether extracts and essential oils in emulsions show a synergistic relationship for antioxidant and antimicrobial properties for food products.
