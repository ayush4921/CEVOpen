<p>To measure antioxidant activity, two assays—the DPPH (2,2‐diphenyl‐1‐picrylhydrazyl) free radical scavenging activity and the FRAP (ferric reducing antioxidant power)—were used to determine the in vitro antioxidant activities of the essential oils of 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris </italic>and 
 <italic>Thymbra spicata</italic>. The free radical scavenging activity is higher for lower IC
 <sub>50</sub> values. The amount of essential oil or extract needed to decrease the initial radical DPPH˙ concentration by 50% is used for the free radical scavenging activity and defined as IC
 <sub>50</sub>. Results of the antioxidant activity test are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn31007-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The free radical scavenging activity of thyme essential oil obtained with MAE (93.77 ± 13.0 µg/ml) was significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) higher than that found with HD (159.59 ± 12.79 µg/ml). When comparing the results with a corresponding commercial product (250 ± 0.01 µg/ml), the essential oil of thyme used in the current study had a much higher free radical scavenging activity (Teixeira et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31007-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). A similar pattern was observed for the free radical scavenging activity of the zahter essential oil. The MAE extraction (129.48 ± 11.58 µg/ml) had a significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) higher free radical scavenging activity than the HD (181.56 ± 2.13 µg/ml). Earlier studies found that compounds such as carvacrol and thymol exist in high amounts in Lamiaceae family plants. Lee et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31007-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>) found that volatile components such as carvacrol and thymol had antioxidant properties that hindered the hexanal inhibition by 95%–100% over a 30‐day period at 5 µg/ml concentration. It was also reported that thymol and carvacrol were successfully used in active packaging as antioxidants (Ramos et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31007-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). The present study found that thyme had a higher antioxidant capacity than zahter. This could be due to the presence of a high thymol content in 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic>. Previous studies found that thymol has a higher antioxidant activity due to the greater steric hindering effects of the phenolic group in thymol, which is greater than that of carvacrol (Yanishlieva, Marinova, Gordon, &amp; Raneva, 
 <xref rid="fsn31007-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">1999</xref>), which corresponds with our results. Our study is the first to report on the determination of the DPPH˙ free radical scavenging activity of zahter essential oil. Both thyme and zahter essential oils obtained by HD and MAE had higher free radical scavenging activity in comparison with 
 <italic>Thymus spathulifolius </italic>(0.243 ± 7.20 mg/ml; Sokmen et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31007-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>), 
 <italic>Thymus mastichina</italic> (3.11 ± 0.11 mg/ml), 
 <italic>Thymus zygis</italic> (0.9 ± 0.03 mg/ml), 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> (4.05 ± 0.09 mg/ml), 
 <italic>Thymus capitatus</italic> (0.6 ± 0.02 mg/ml; Ballester‐Costa, Sendra, Fernandez‐Lopez, Perez‐Alvarez, &amp; Viuda‐Martos, 
 <xref rid="fsn31007-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>), and 
 <italic>Thymua danesis </italic>subsp. 
 <italic>Lancifolius</italic> (23.9 ± 0.6 mg/ml; Tavakolpour, Moosavi‐Nasab, Niakousari, &amp; Haghighi‐Manesh, 
 <xref rid="fsn31007-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Similar results were also obtained in comparison with 
 <italic>Satureja thymbra </italic>essential oil (96.7 µg/ml; Giweli, Dzamic, Sokovic, Ristic, &amp; Marin, 
 <xref rid="fsn31007-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>).
