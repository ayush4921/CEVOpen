<p>The results of the TPC of the plant extracts are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn31007-tbl-0004" ref-type="table">4</xref>. The 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris </italic>methanol extract had significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) higher TPC than its 80% ethanol extract and also more than the 
 <italic>Thymbra spicata</italic> methanol and ethanol extracts. The TPC ranged between 13.13 and 15.13 mg GAE/g for dry weight. Sokmen et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31007-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>) reported very high TPC at 141 mg GAE/g DW for 
 <italic>T. spathulifolius</italic>. However, Skendi et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31007-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>) reported between 34.3 and 70.4 mg GAE/g DW of TPC for Lamiaceae family plant methanol extracts. In contrast, Fatma et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31007-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>) reported 7.05–8.81 mg GAE/g DW for 
 <italic>T. hirtus </italic>sp. algeriensis from various locations in Tunisia. Roby et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31007-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>) reported levels of TPC from 4.75 to 8.10 mg GAE/g DW for 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic>. Our results align with these reported studies. The TFC results are displayed in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn31007-tbl-0004" ref-type="table">4</xref>. The TFC ranged from 3.24 to 7.285 mg QUE/g DW for all the extracts. Methanol extracts exhibited significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) higher amounts of TFC in comparison with ethanol extracts. Also, thyme extracts had a significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) higher amount of TFC than zahter extracts. Tohidi et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31007-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>) reported between 1.89 and 8.55 mg QUE/g among the 14 Thymus species from Iran and found the highest TFC in 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic>, with 8.55 mg QUE/g. However, in some other studies, the TFC was determined based on rutin equivalent (Fatma et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31007-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Miliauskas, Venskutonis, &amp; van Beek, 
 <xref rid="fsn31007-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>). Both the TPC and the TFC supplied information about the antioxidant capacity because higher phenolic content is associated with higher antioxidant activity.
