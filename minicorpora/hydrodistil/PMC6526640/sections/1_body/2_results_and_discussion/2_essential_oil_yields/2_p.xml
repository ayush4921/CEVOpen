<p>The total yields of volatile chemicals from 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris </italic>(thyme) and 
 <italic>Thymbra spicata </italic>(zahter) are given in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn31007-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Results showed that microwave‐assisted extraction (MAE) of zahter had a significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) higher oil yield (2.16% ± 0.16%) in comparison with its hydrodistillation (HD; 1.59% ± 0.06%). However, the distillation method did not affect the oil yield (%) for thyme (1.8 ± 0.14 for HD; 1.77 ± 0.05 for MAE). The essential oils of both thyme and zahter obtained with MAE were darker in color. Golmakani and Rezaei (
 <xref rid="fsn31007-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>) reported similar results for the essential oil of 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic>: 2.52% for microwave‐assisted extraction, with the exception of a longer extraction time (2 hr) with a higher power wattage (990 W) and 2.39% for hydrodistillation (4 hr). Ozel, Gogus, and Lewis (
 <xref rid="fsn31007-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>) used supercritical water extraction for 
 <italic>Thymbra spicata</italic> essential oil, finding that an increase in the extraction temperature also increased oil yield, but they found a comparable extraction efficiency of 2% at 100°C. Similar results were reported by Uysal et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31007-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>) for the essential oil of 
 <italic>Thymbra spicata</italic> using solvent‐free microwave extraction (2.5%) and hydrodistillation (2.4%). In another study, ultrasound‐assisted ohmic heating provided much higher oil yield (%) for 
 <italic>Thymus daenensis </italic>in comparison with hydrodistillation (Tavakolpour et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31007-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Microwave extraction provides comparable yields with other methods and uses less time, energy, and only a small amount of water to hydrate the dry plants.
