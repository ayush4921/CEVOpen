<p>Reactive oxidative species, such as singlet oxygen, hydroxyl radical, peroxyl radical, and lipid hydrogen peroxide, cause oxidation of food products. Food oxidation can lead to the production of toxic compounds as well as a loss of nutrition. Also, oxidation reduces the shelf life and consumer acceptability of food products. Antioxidants scavenge radicals in food by donating hydrogen to these radicals and produce antioxidant radicals with low reduction potential. Also, due to the low reduction potential of these antioxidant radicals, they cannot cause oxidation of other molecules (Choe &amp; Min, 
 <xref rid="fsn31007-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). Phenolic compounds found in plants are great examples of natural antioxidants and can be used as food additives in formulations, coatings, or active packaging, to slow the oxidation of food products. Results of the antioxidant tests are shown in Table

The difference in the DPPH radical scavenging activity might result from the extraction method, extraction solvent, geographical location, or difference in plants within the same family. These variations were reported in previous studies (Fatma et al.,
