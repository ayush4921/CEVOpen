<p>Based on the obtained results, the thyme plant extracts had significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) higher antioxidant capacity than the zahter plant extracts. We also determined the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of gallic acid 1.74 µg/ml as a positive standard. Plant extracts provided lower antioxidant capacity in comparison with pure gallic acid. Results of the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn31007-tbl-0004" ref-type="table">4</xref>. The FRAP value of the thyme plant extracts was significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) higher than that of the zahter plant extracts. FRAP values were between 14.19 and 30.88 µM Fe
 <sup>+2</sup>/g. In addition, methanol provided significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) higher FRAP values in comparison with ethanol extracts. The results of the DPPH and FRAP assays were highly correlated. Similar results were observed by Ballester‐Costa et al. (

 <xref rid="fsn31007-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref> shows that hydrophilic fractions have higher radical scavenging activity and FRAP values than the essential oils of these plants. This might be explained by the fact that the bioactive compounds of essential oils are more effective in inhibiting conjugated dienes than free radical scavenging activity. Sokmen et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31007-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>) found similar results for 
 <italic>Thymus spathulifolius</italic>.
