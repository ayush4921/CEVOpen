<p>Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis resulted in the identification of 20 compounds for 
 <italic>Thymbra spicata</italic>, as shown in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn31007-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>. All the constituents of the essential oil were not significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05) different when using HD and MAE. Major components of the essential oil were carvacrol (68.20%, 66.91%), γ‐terpinene (13.25%, 13.94%), p
 <italic>‐</italic>cymene (5.37%, 4.65%), β‐caryophyllene (2.59%, 4.02%), and thymol (1.19%, 2.16%) when using HD and MAE, respectively. Similar results have been reported in several studies: Kizil et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31007-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>) identified 23 compounds in zahter essential oil and found the carvacrol content to be 67.08% from the same region, while in another study, lower carvacrol content was reported, with 36.1% when using HD and 44.8% when using MAE for essential oils of zahter from Antalya, Turkey (Kizil et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31007-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>; Uysal et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31007-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Much higher carvacrol content (75.74%) was also found in zahter essential oil from Mugla, Turkey (Sarac, Ugur, &amp; Duru, 
 <xref rid="fsn31007-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). Inan, Kirpik, Kaya, and Kirici (
 <xref rid="fsn31007-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>) investigated various harvesting times (i.e., before flowering, during flowering, and after flowering) on the essential oil constituents of zahter. Results of their study showed that γ‐terpinene decreased after flowering, while carvacrol increased. Similarly, Barakat, Wakim, Apostolides, Srour, and Beyrouthy (
 <xref rid="fsn31007-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>) found differences in the content of the constituents of the essential oil of zahter from Lebanon obtained before, during, and after flowering. They also reported the highest p
 <italic>‐</italic>cymene content (8.1%–46.8%) in comparison with our study and other studies from Turkey. Research has shown that many factors involving extraction parameters, such as temperature, time, and type of extraction procedure as well as location, soil composition, moisture, altitude, and many other environmental factors can influence the content and composition of an essential oil. Our study demonstrated that the microwave extraction method gives similar results in comparison with the traditional Clevenger method.
