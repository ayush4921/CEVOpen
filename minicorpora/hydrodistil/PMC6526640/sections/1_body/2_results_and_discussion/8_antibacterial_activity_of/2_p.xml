<p>Results of the antibacterial activity test based on disk diffusion are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn31007-tbl-0005" ref-type="table">5</xref>. The antibacterial activity of 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris </italic>and 
 <italic>Thymbra spicata </italic>essential oil and plant extracts was tested against gram‐positive and gram‐negative bacteria. Plant extracts did not display any antibacterial effects against the tested bacteria, while essential oils of both plants showed an antibacterial effect. The maximum effect was found against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> ATCC 9144 (24–35 mm), and the minimum activity was shown against 
 <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> ATCC 14028 (11–14.5 mm). The essential oil of 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris </italic>that underwent microwave‐assisted extraction displayed significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) higher antibacterial activity against four bacteria than did the hydrodistilled essential oil. The major chemical components of the essential oil, such as thymol and carvacrol, have been associated with antimicrobial properties (Rota, Herrera, Martinez, Sotomayor, &amp; Jordan, 
 <xref rid="fsn31007-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>; Sokmen et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31007-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>). This also aligns with our results. However, the fact that these major components occurred in a much higher quantity in hydrodistilled essential oil (Tables 
 <xref rid="fsn31007-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="fsn31007-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>) indicates that minor components can also influence antibacterial properties. Similar results were reported earlier (Bounatirou et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31007-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>; Rota et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31007-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). For 
 <italic>Thymbra spicata</italic>, the microwave‐assisted extraction of essential oil provided a larger inhibition zone (23–35 mm) for Gr (+) bacteria, while hydrodistilled oil provided a larger inhibition zone (14–19 mm) for Gr (−) bacteria. Overall, both essential oils showed a higher inhibition effect against Gr (+) bacteria in comparison with Gr (−) bacteria; this could be due to the difference in the wall type for Gr (+) and Gr (−) bacteria (Erturk et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31007-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>; Teixeira et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31007-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). In addition to successful results obtained from in vitro antimicrobial studies, thyme essential oil or its bioactive components such as thymol and carvacrol have been successfully used as antimicrobial agents in surface washes on fresh produce and meat (Lu et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31007-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Lu &amp; Wu, 
 <xref rid="fsn31007-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>,
 <xref rid="fsn31007-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). The essential oil of both 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris </italic>and 
 <italic>Thymbra spicata </italic>provided an antibacterial effect against these six bacteria. This is especially important because these bacteria are major foodborne pathogens (except 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> ATCC 25922) associated with serious foodborne illnesses. Therefore, the essential oils of 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris </italic>and 
 <italic>Thymbra spicata </italic>can be useful, natural antimicrobials for food preservation.
