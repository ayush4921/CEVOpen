<p>The chemical composition of the 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris </italic>and 
 <italic>Thymbra spicata </italic>methanol and ethanol extracts is shown in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn31007-tbl-0004" ref-type="table">4</xref>. Both of the plant extracts had higher phenolic acids for a majority of the compounds prepared with 80% methanol extract in comparison with 80% ethanol extract. Rosmarinic acid, benzoic acid, rutin, gallic acid, and cinnamic acid were the only compounds for which both the extraction solvent and type of plant had a significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) effect on the content. Rosmarinic acid was found highest in zahter, with 15.65% in the methanol extract in comparison with 7.65% in the ethanol extract, while the rosmarinic acid content for thyme with the methanol extract was 13.66% and with the ethanol extract, 8.69%. High rosmarinic acid content has a great potential because of its possible antioxidant, antibacterial, and antiviral properties (Kostic et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31007-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Our results agree with other studies reported for members of Lamiaceae family plants (Martins et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31007-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>; Roby et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31007-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). Some researchers reported lower rosmarinic acid content (Delgado et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31007-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Skendi et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31007-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Erturk et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31007-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>) studied 
 <italic>Ocimum bacillicum </italic>(sweet basil) and 
 <italic>Thymbra spicata</italic> from Amasya, Turkey. They did not report rosmarinic acid content, but the highest percentages of phenolics were found to be trans‐cinnamic acid (0.0545%) and syringic acid (0.0183%). We found a cinnamic acid content of 0.037% (methanol) and 0.021% (ethanol) for thyme and 0.026% (methanol) and 0.011% (ethanol) for zahter. Roby et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31007-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>) reported very high cinnamic acid content, with 28.54% for thyme. Many factors could influence the phenolic composition of the plants, such as the extraction solvent, methodology, location, soil composition, season, altitude (Kizil et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31007-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>; Magwaza et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31007-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>; Roby et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31007-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). Among the identified and quantified compounds, the second most frequently occurring compound after rosmarinic acid was benzoic acid. Its content ranged from 0.53% to 0.75% for zahter and 1.08% to 1.47% for thyme
 <italic>, </italic>when using ethanol and methanol extracts, respectively. Benzoic acid is an aromatic carboxylic acid naturally found in plant and animal tissues. It can be produced by the plant as protection against fungal attacks. Benzoic acid and its derivatives have been employed in the food industry as antifungal and antibacterial food additives (Olmo, Calzada, &amp; Nunez, 
 <xref rid="fsn31007-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Based on all the available data, we found that 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> and 
 <italic>Thymbra spicata</italic> provided a relatively high amount of rosmarinic acid and benzoic acid. Plant extracts with such high levels of rosmarinic acid and benzoic acid can be used as a natural food additive to improve the shelf life of food products.
