<p>Essential oil produced by the leaves had a higher antioxidative activity compared to essential oils from the underground parts of the plant, likely due to different chemical composition. Our results for the antioxidant activity of the leaves’ essential oil are supported by results for 
 <italic>Petasites albus</italic>, a different species in the Petasites genus, from Iran [

 <italic>P. hybridus</italic> subsp. ochroleucus contained high concentrations of sesquiterpene lactones (fukinanolide 33.42%) (

 <xref rid="B29-plants-09-00700" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], therefore it is likely that the higher antioxidant activity of the leaves’ vs the rhizome’s essential oil is due to the higher fukinanolide concentration.
