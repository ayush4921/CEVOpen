0: To the best of our knowledge, the chemical composition of the essential oil of  P. hybridus, subsp.
1: ochroleucus has not been studied before, and only limited information is available regarding its biological activities, despite the common use of the plant by the people of the Balkans.
2: Variability in chemical composition within and between  P. hybridus species is known to occur [ 11, 17].
3: We therefore analyzed the chemical profile of the essential oils, as well as their effect on a range of biological and toxicological activities.
4: Chemical composition may also vary between plant organs, and we have therefore comparatively evaluated the composition and activities of essential oils from leaves and rhizomes.
