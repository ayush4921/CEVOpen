<p>Edema thickness (mm) represents increases in the paw thickness at different time intervals after the carrageenan injection, relative to the values obtained before injection. Anti-inflammatory activity (edema inhibition) was calculated as anti-inflammatory activity (%) = (C–T)/(C) ×100, where C represents edema thickness in the control group, and T is the edema thickness in the test group. Indomethacin (10 mg/kg, p.o.) dissolved in saline was used as a standard anti-inflammatory drug, and its anti-inflammatory activity was measured as compared with the control group of animals that received the same amount of normal saline. Indomethacin and saline were given orally, 1 h before the carrageenan was injected. Data is expressed as mean ± S.D. The data was subjected to one–way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Dunnett’s test. Differences between two means were detected by Student
