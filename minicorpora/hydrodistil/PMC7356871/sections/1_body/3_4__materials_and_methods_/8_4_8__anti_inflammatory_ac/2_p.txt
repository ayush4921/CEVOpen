0: Edema thickness (mm) represents increases in the paw thickness at different time intervals after the carrageenan injection, relative to the values obtained before injection.
1: Anti-inflammatory activity (edema inhibition) was calculated as anti-inflammatory activity (%) = (CT)/(C) 100, where C represents edema thickness in the control group, and T is the edema thickness in the test group.
2: Indomethacin (10 mg/kg, p.o.)
3: dissolved in saline was used as a standard anti-inflammatory drug, and its anti-inflammatory activity was measured as compared with the control group of animals that received the same amount of normal saline.
4: Indomethacin and saline were given orally, 1 h before the carrageenan was injected.
5: Data is expressed as mean  S.D.
6: The data was subjected to oneway analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Dunnetts test.
7: Differences between two means were detected by Student  t-test.
8: Data were considered significantly different for  p< 0.05.
