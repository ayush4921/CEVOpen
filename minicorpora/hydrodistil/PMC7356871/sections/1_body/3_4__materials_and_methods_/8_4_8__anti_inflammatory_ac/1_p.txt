0: Anti-inflammation activity of the essential oils was determined on Carrageenan-induced paw edema in Sprague Dawley rats, following Amdekar et al.
1: (2012) [ 37, 38].
2: Female Sprague Dawley rats (180250 g) were divided into nine groups of five animals per group.
3: In all groups, 0.1 mL, 1%  w/ v -carrageenan analytical grade (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie Gmbh., Munich, Germany) in normal saline was injected into the subplantar tissue of the right hind paw.
4: Plant essential oils, obtained from rhizomes and leaves, were dissolved separately in 2.5% DMSO (final volume 50 L) and applied on the right hind paw of rats from the test groups, in concentrations of 10%, 20% or 40%.
5: Oil was applied twice: first, immediately after the carrageenan injection, and again 3 hours later.
6: The same volume (50 L) of DMSO was applied to the right paw of animals from the control group.
7: Paw thickness was measured before the carrageenan injection and 1, 2, 4 and 6 h after, using a digital caliper.
