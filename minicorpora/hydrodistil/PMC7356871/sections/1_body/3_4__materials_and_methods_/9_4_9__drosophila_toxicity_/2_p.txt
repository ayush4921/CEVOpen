0: Risk Assessment Tool Analysis Software RA V1.0 was used to predict the short term LC50 (the lethal concentration required to kill 50% of the experimental population at a given time) by using surface response model analysis of the results for the  P. hybridus rhizome and leaf extracts after subchronic exposure.
1: Furthermore, the chronic toxicity threshold (LC1) was derived for the  D. melanogaster (larva to adult).
2: Development time (larva to pupa; larva to adult) was calculated for each replica of 20 eggs (N = 3) according to the following equation: DT = n d*d/n t, where n d is the number of pupating larvae/emerging flies d days after the eggs were laid, and n t is the total number of individuals pupating/emerging at the end of experiment.
3: Results were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukeys test and Dunnetts procedure if significant.
4: In addition, frequency analysis was performed by pooling together three replicas (total N = 60 per concentration) and results were expressed as categorical data (1pass, or 0fail).
5: A chi-square test was conducted to assess significant differences in the relative mortality or pupation frequencies.
6: If significant, after residual analysis, Fischers exact test was used to compare specific 2  2 tables and assess differences in the relative frequencies.
7: Only a  p value of  0.05 was considered statistically significant.
