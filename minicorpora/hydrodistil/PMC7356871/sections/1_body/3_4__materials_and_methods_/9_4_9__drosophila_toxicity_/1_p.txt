0: Larvae of  Drosophila melanogaster Oregon-RC (wild-type flies, stock no.
1: 5) ("Bloomington  Drosophila Stock Center", Indiana University, USA) fruit flies were used for toxicity testing.
2: Fruit flies were cared for, grown, fed, mated and transferred to the treatment media as previously described [ 30].
3: Larvae aged 72  4 h were washed with distilled water and transferred to the standard feeding media containing 0, 0.19, 0.38, 0.75, 1.5 or 3%  v/v of either rhizome or leaf oil extract from  P. hybridus.
4: Each experimental/control group consisted of 3 replicas.
5: Each replica contained 20 larvae.
6: Number of pupae, hatched adults and adult mortality were recorded daily.
7: The exposure period lasted until all individuals that were alive emerged from pupae, i.e., 7 and 13 days for the rhizome and leaf essential oil extracts, respectively.
8: As each of the adults emerged from its pupae it was immediately transferred to a new essential oil extract-free feeding medium.
9: Hatched adults were monitored for an additional 7 (rhizome oil group) or 14 (leaf oil group) days after emergence for any prolonged effects on adulthood survival.
