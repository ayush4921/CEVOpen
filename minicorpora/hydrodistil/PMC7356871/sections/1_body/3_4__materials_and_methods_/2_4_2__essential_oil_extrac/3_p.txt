0: Essential oils from leaves and rhizome are complex systems containing numerous compounds, as is shown in  Figure S1 (supplemental).
1: Occurrence of the overlapped and embedded peaks is evident in the total ion chromatogram (TIC), as shown in the result of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis, especially with regard to teropenoids/sesquiterpenoids (compounds 1662).
2: First, the peaks from TICs obtained by GC-MS were identified by applying SIA.
3: AMDIS was used for the deconvolution of these peaks and extraction of characteristic ion peaks originating from the specific compounds.
4: After deconvolution, the purified mass spectrum of each peak was compared with the National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST) 08 database or the mass spectra of standards.
