0: The essential oil was extracted from fresh rhizomes and leaves by hydrodistillation for 4 h using a Clevenger-type apparatus.
1: The extracted oil was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and stored at 4 C until further use.
2: Chemical profile of the essential oils was obtained by GC and GC-MS analyses.
3: The GC analysis was performed on a GC HP-5890 II apparatus, equipped with a splitsplitless injector, an HP-5MS capillary column (30 m  0.25 mm, 0.25 m film thickness) using helium as the carrier gas (1 mL/min), and a flame ionization detector.
4: Operating conditions were as previously reported [ 30].
