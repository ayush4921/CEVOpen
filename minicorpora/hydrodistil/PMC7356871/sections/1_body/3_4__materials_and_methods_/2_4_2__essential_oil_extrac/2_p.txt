0: Comparison of Kovats retention indices [applying calibrated automated mass spectral deconvolution and identification system software (AMDIS ver.
1: 2.64)], in combination with the SIA resolution method [ 31], was used for detection of the compounds.
2: Spectral data were compared with the available literature [ 32], while obtained mass spectra were compared to those from Wiley 275 and NIST/NBS libraries using various search engines.
3: The retention indices were obtained by co-injection with a standard aliphatic hydrocarbons C7C40 mixture.
