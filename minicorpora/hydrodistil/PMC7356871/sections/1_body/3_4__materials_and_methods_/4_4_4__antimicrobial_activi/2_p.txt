0: The antibacterial activity of the essential oils against the selected bacteria was evaluated in vitro, by Micro-Well Dilution Assay [ 33], as was previously described [ 30].
1: All experiments were performed in triplicates, and two growth controls, consisting of the corresponding medium with 10% DMSO (as a negative control) and antibiotic Doxycycline (as a positive control), were included (the concentration of Doxycycline ranged from 0.005 to 10.0 mg/mL).
2: Bacterial growth was determined by adding 20 L of 0.5% triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) aqueous solution to the plate [ 34].
3: Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was defined as the lowest concentration of the oil that inhibited visible growth (red colored pellet on the bottom of the wells after the addition of TTC).
4: For the determination of the minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC), broth was taken from each well that did not exhibit visible growth, and inoculated in Mueller Hinton agar for 24 h at 37 C. MBC was defined as the lowest oil concentration that killed 99.9% of the bacterial cells.
