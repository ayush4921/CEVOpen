<p>The toxicity test on 
 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> revealed that the essential oils from both the rhizomes and the leaves is toxic for developing larvae. For both essential oils, significant larvae mortality was noted, starting at the concentration of 0.38% (Fischer’s exact test, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). Estimated 48 h and 96 h LC50s for the rhizome oil were 3.40% and 3.13%, respectively. By comparison, the leaves’ essential oil was four times more toxic, with estimated 48 h and 96 h LC50s of 0.84% and 0.80%, respectively (

Prolonged monitoring of pupae (until all individuals reached imago stadium) did not show any further significant increase in mortality at the stage of pupa with rhizome essential oil. Only a few individuals that turned into pupae could not achieve imago stadium. However, for the leaves’ essential oil, prolonged mortality was evident during the pupa stage. In the two highest concentrations tested, for both oil types, it was also noted that the larvae grew slower, and both the larvae pupae, and adults were visibly smaller compared to the other groups.
