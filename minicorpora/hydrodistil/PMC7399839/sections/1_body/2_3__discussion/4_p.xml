The volatile oil of sage was mostly made up of terpenoids (&gt;80% of the total compounds identified). A study by Narayanan et al. (2015) revealed the antimicrobial activity of various extracts of

 <italic>Fusobacterium nucleatum</italic> and highlighted the fact that the strong inhibitory activity of
