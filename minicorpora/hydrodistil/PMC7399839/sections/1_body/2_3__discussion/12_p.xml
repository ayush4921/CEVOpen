<p>In the present study, we evaluated the EO influence on membrane integrity and efflux pumps activity of the streptococcal strains, since it is well-known that 
 <italic>S. salivarius</italic> is a reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes and exchanges genetic material with other species [
 <xref rid="B46-antibiotics-09-00428" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Integrative and conjugative elements are chromosomal mobile genetic elements detected in 
 <italic>S. salivarius</italic> and in silico in other 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic> species (
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> and 
 <italic>S. parasanguinis</italic>) that can transfer autonomously by conjugation intra- and interspecies interactions [
 <xref rid="B47-antibiotics-09-00428" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In this approach, we have used a flow cytometry protocol, since is well-known that fluorescence-based flow cytometric methods could provide accurate, rapid, and highly sensitive results regarding the viability and vitality of the bacterial cells after incubation with EOs.
