<p>On the other side, there are approximately 500,000 plant species in the world, of which only 1% have been phytochemically analyzed, which means that there is a still a high potential for the discovery of new bioactive compounds [

Natural products derived from medicinal plants have proven to be an abundant source of pharmacologically active compounds, many of which being the basis for the development of synthetic or semisynthetic derivatives for the pharmaceutical industry. Volatile oils, products of plant secondary metabolisms, are valuable resources for the development of new anti-infective therapeutic alternatives. Numerous research papers but, also, patents are based on the use of volatile oils for various formulations with antimicrobial/antipathogenic activity.
