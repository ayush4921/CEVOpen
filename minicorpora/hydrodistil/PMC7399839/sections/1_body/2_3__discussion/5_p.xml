<p>The volatile oil obtained from aerial parts of summer savory—
 <italic>S. hortensis</italic>—was the most efficient in inhibiting the bacterial growth, with MIC values of 0.08 to 10.91 mg/mL. The major components in the volatile oil of 
 <italic>S. hortensis</italic> were carvacrol and γ-terpinene, the distribution of terpenes:terpenoids being balanced in this mixture. Carvacrol is mentioned in the literature as a a substance with proven antimicrobial activity due to the presence of the free hydroxyl group, hydrophobicity, and the phenol moiety. Our results were similar to those of different research teams. Sharifi-Rad et al. used an extract from aerial parts of 
 <italic>Satureja intermedia C.A.</italic> and reported MIC values of 4.2–5.1 mg/mL against 
 <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> and an MIC of 11.4–12.5 mg/mL for 
 <italic>S. salivarius</italic> [

 <italic>Satureja khuzestanica</italic> and 
 <italic>Satureja bachtiarica</italic> and reported MIC values between 0.062 and 0.25 and 0.125–0.5 µL/mL for a wide range of strains, including 
 <italic>S. mutans, S. sanguis, S. salivarius</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. sobrinus</italic> [
