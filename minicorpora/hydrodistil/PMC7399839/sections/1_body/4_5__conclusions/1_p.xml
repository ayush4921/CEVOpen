<p>EOs harbor many different biological properties including antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activity. Plant-derived compounds can hamper biofilm formations by targeting peptidoglycan synthesis, by damaging the bacterial membrane or by inhibiting the quorum-sensing process. We show here that EOS from 
 <italic>Anethum graveolens</italic>, 
 <italic>Salvia officinalis</italic> and 
 <italic>Satureja hortensis</italic> exhibited high bactericidal and antibiofilm activity against bacterial strains isolated from patients with oral diseases (
 <italic>Streptococcus mitis, S. salivarius, Prevotella oralis, Fusobacterium mortiferum, Actinomyces naeslundii</italic>). Subsequent flow cytometry analysis confirmed that the tested EOs act by permeabilizing the bacterial membrane and/or by inhibiting the activity of the efflux pumps. Out of the EOs tested, the summer savory EO induced a proinflammatory effect, while the others did not significantly influence the cytokines profile of THP-1 cells. Taken together, our results indicate that summer savory EO and, to a lesser extent, sage and dill EOs could be used to inhibit bacteria involved in oral plaque formation and to reduce the expression of genes known to contribute to the inflammatory response.
