0: Bacterial strains used in this study are members of the commensal oral microbiota and periodontal disease isolated from the subgingival bacterial plaque of individuals with periodontitis (from whom, written consent was obtained).
1: In this study, we used 25 strains, identified by API Biomeriuex as  Enterococcus faecalis, Aerococcus viridans, Eubacterium lentum, Pantoea sp.,  Prevotela oralis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Gemalla morbillorum, Staphylococcus sciuri, Staphylococcus xylosus, Pasteurella haemolytica, Micrococcus sp.,  Fusobacterium mortiferum, Streptococcus salivarius sp.
2: salivarius, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus mitis, and  Streptococcus acidomimimas.
3: The quantitative analysis of the antimicrobial activity of the volatile oils was performed using the method of serial microdilutions in a liquid medium (Mueller-Hinton broth) in 96-well plates [ 50, 51].
4: The volatile oils and analytical standard (-pinene was the chosen analytical standard, since it was found in all the EOs) were serially diluted in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to a final volume of 200 l. The negative control was represented by culture medium and the positive control by bacterial cultures.
5: The plates containing the bacterial cells and the tested EOs were incubated at 37 C for 18 h. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was established macroscopically as the last concentration at which the appearance of microbial growth was not observed, respectively, the appearance of turbidity and by spectrophotometric reading of the absorbance at 620 nm.
