0: The THP-1 monocyte line (American Tissue Culture CollectionsATCC: TIB-202) (Rockville, MD, USA) was used for immunomodulation experiments.
1: Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium with (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA), 1.0 Mm sodium pyruvate, and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA).
2: To evaluate the cytokine profile, THP1 cells (500,000 cells) were treated for 1 h with volatile oils (1:5000).
3: After 1 h, LPS (1 g/mL) was added, and incubation was continued at 37 C for 3.5 h. Cells were harvested and centrifuged at 1300 rpm.
4: Total RNA from cell sediments was extracted using an RNA isolation kit (RNeasy Mini Kit, Qiagen) according to the manufacturers instructions.
5: The total RNA was eluted with 25 L RNase-free water and DNase treated prior reverse-transcription (DNase TURBO, 2 Units, 30 min, 37 C).
6: The purity and concentration of RNA were established using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer, and the integrity of the total RNA was assessed through gel electrophoresis.
7: Two micrograms of RNA from tissue samples was reverse-transcribed using the high-capacity cDNA reverse-transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, USA) according to the manufacturers protocol.
8: The obtained cDNAs were subjected to real-time qRT-PCR (on a 7300 Applied Biosystems Real-Time PCR System) using the following TaqMan probes: Il-1beta (Assay ID: Hs00174097_m1); Il-2, Il-6, and Il-10 (Assay ID: Hs00174131_m1); TNF-a (Assay ID: Hs00174128_m1); and housekeeping gene TaqMan  Ribosomal RNA Control Reagents (p/n4308313).
