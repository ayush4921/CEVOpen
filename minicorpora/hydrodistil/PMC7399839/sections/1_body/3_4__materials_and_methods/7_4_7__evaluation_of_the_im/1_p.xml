<p>The THP-1 monocyte line (American Tissue Culture Collections–ATCC: TIB-202) (Rockville, MD, USA) was used for immunomodulation experiments. Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium with (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA), 1.0 Mm sodium pyruvate, and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). To evaluate the cytokine profile, THP1 cells (500,000 cells) were treated for 1 h with volatile oils (1:5000). After 1 h, LPS (1 µg/mL) was added, and incubation was continued at 37 °C for 3.5 h. Cells were harvested and centrifuged at 1300 rpm. Total RNA from cell sediments was extracted using an RNA isolation kit (RNeasy Mini Kit, Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The total RNA was eluted with 25 μL RNase-free water and DNase treated prior reverse-transcription (DNase TURBO, 2 Units, 30 min, 37 °C). The purity and concentration of RNA were established using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer, and the integrity of the total RNA was assessed through gel electrophoresis. Two micrograms of RNA from tissue samples was reverse-transcribed using the high-capacity cDNA reverse-transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The obtained cDNAs were subjected to real-time qRT-PCR (on a 7300 Applied Biosystems Real-Time PCR System) using the following TaqMan probes: Il-1beta (Assay ID: Hs00174097_m1); Il-2, Il-6, and Il-10 (Assay ID: Hs00174131_m1); TNF-a (Assay ID: Hs00174128_m1); and housekeeping gene TaqMan
