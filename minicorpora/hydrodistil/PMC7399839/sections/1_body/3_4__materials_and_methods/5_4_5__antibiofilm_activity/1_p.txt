0: The EO influences on biofilm formations on inert substrata were assessed using the same procedure as the one for testing the antimicrobial activity, but after the incubation (18 h, 37 C, no shaking), the plates containing the inoculum and the EOs were emptied of their contents, washed 3 times with saline solution to eliminate any nonadherent cells, and treated with alcohol in order to fix adherent cells.
1: After violet crystal staining, the plates were treated with acetic acid 33% solution, and optical density was read at 490 nm using FlexStation3 (Molecular Devices, Foster City, CA, USA).
2: Negative (culture medium) and positive (untreated cells) controls were used.
3: The minimal biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) corresponded to the last concentration at which there was no bacterial growth.
