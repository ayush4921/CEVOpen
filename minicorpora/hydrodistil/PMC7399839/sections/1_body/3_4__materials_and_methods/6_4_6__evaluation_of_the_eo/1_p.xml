<p>The bacterial cells grown in the presence of the EOs were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 3 min, washed twice, resuspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (adjusting, if necessary, the optical density OD
 <sub>620</sub> of the suspended cells to 0.01–0.04 mau, corresponding to an inoculum under 10
 <sup>7</sup> CFU/mL), stained (propidium iodide (PI 10 µg/mL) and ethidium bromide (EB 5 µg/mL), and incubated for 5 min at 4 °C in the dark. Positive (heat-inactivated cells at 100 °C for 1 h) and negative (viable cells) controls for membrane permeabilization were used. The fluorochromes used for cell staining allowed the investigation of the cellular coatings’ integrity (PI) and the efflux pumps’ activity (EB). For the assay, we used a FACS Calibur instrument equipped with a 488 nm Argon laser, using filters—a 670-nm-long pass-filter for samples stained with PI and a 585 ± 42-nm-band pass filter for the samples stained with EB. Forward scatter (FSC) vs. side scatter (SSC) and fluorescence measurements were acquired. Typical photomultiplier tube voltage parameters were SSC 550 V for bacteria and 450 V for fungal cells (log scale), a 670-nm-long pass filter (log scale) and a 585 ± 42-nm-band pass filter 550 V (log scale). A total of 10,000 events were collected in all runs.
