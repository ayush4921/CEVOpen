0: The bacterial cells grown in the presence of the EOs were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 3 min, washed twice, resuspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (adjusting, if necessary, the optical density OD 620 of the suspended cells to 0.010.04 mau, corresponding to an inoculum under 10 7 CFU/mL), stained (propidium iodide (PI 10 g/mL) and ethidium bromide (EB 5 g/mL), and incubated for 5 min at 4 C in the dark.
1: Positive (heat-inactivated cells at 100 C for 1 h) and negative (viable cells) controls for membrane permeabilization were used.
2: The fluorochromes used for cell staining allowed the investigation of the cellular coatings integrity (PI) and the efflux pumps activity (EB).
3: For the assay, we used a FACS Calibur instrument equipped with a 488 nm Argon laser, using filtersa 670-nm-long pass-filter for samples stained with PI and a 585  42-nm-band pass filter for the samples stained with EB.
4: Forward scatter (FSC) vs. side scatter (SSC) and fluorescence measurements were acquired.
5: Typical photomultiplier tube voltage parameters were SSC 550 V for bacteria and 450 V for fungal cells (log scale), a 670-nm-long pass filter (log scale) and a 585  42-nm-band pass filter 550 V (log scale).
6: A total of 10,000 events were collected in all runs.
