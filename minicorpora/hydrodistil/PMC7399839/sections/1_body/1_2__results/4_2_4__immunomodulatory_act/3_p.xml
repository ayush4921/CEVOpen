<p>IL-6 is a multifunctional cytokine secreted by monocytes, macrophages, T lymphocytes, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts in the early stages of the infectious process. IL-6 stimulates IgA synthesis in lymphoid structures associated with mucous membranes. The effects of IL-6 are synergistic with those of IL-1b, and it is an essential mediator of the acute phase response [

TNF-α is produced primarily by activated macrophages but, also, by other cells, including adipocytes, B lymphocytes, keratinocytes, fibroblasts, granulocytes, mast cells, monocytes, NK cells, smooth muscle cells, and T cells. IL-6 stimulates inflammation, under the action of variable stimuli, such as allogenic and bacterial cells, immune complexes, LPS, reactive oxygen species, malignant cells, and viral infections. 
 <italic>S. hortensis</italic> volatile oil upregulated the gene expression for IL-6 and TNF-α, whereas the
