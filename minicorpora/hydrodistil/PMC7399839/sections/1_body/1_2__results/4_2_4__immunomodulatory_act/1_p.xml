<p>The THP-1 cell line has become a model for the study of the functions and mechanisms of activation of monocytes and/or macrophages during the physiological or pathological inflammatory response, as well as of immunomodulators. THP-1 can be differentiated into macrophages using growth factors such as prostaglandin E2, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, or lipopolysaccharides (LPS) [

LPS-treated THP-1 cells respond rapidly by altering the expression of interleukin genes (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-α), which can be detected rapidly after 1–6 h of incubation. In addition, the exposure of THP-1 cells to LPS results in the activation of transcription factor NF-κB, which, in turn, activates genes for other chemokines and cytokines involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and survival. In this study, we aimed to monitor the gene expression for pro- (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokines in THP-1 cells treated with essential oils and then stimulated with LPS. Interleukin 10 is the main cytokine with anti-inflammatory effects, whose main function is to limit inflammatory reactions and regulate the differentiation and proliferation of immune cells (T, B cells, natural killer, antigen-presenting cells, mast cells, and granulocytes [
