<p>The antimicrobial activity of the volatile oils was evaluated against 25 Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains isolated from patients with oral diseases. These strains belong to species with proven pathogenic potential (
 <italic>Streptococcus mitis, S. salivarius, Prevotella oralis, Fusobacterium mortiferum,</italic> and 
 <italic>Actinomyces naeslundii</italic>) or are members of the oral microbiota. The results are expressed as minimum inhibitory concentration—MIC values (mg/mL) established after the spectrophotometric reading of the optical density of bacterial cultures for the entire concentration range tested for each variant analyzed. The EOs were ranked according to their antimicrobial effect. The classification criterion was that proposed by Carson and Hammer [
 <xref rid="B23-antibiotics-09-00428" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Concentration ranges were established for the analytical variants: &lt;1%, 1.5–2.5%, ~5%, and &gt;5% (
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>). Thus, volatile oils with antibacterial activity at concentrations &gt;5% were considered to have minimal effects (e.g., 
 <italic>A. graveolens</italic>), and those with antimicrobial activity at concentrations &lt;1% were considered to have maximum effects (e.g., 
 <italic>S. hortensis</italic>).
