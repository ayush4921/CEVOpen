0: Periodontitis is the most common chronic infection in the adult population globally.
1: It is estimated that about 50% of subjects affected have forms of gingivitis (inflammation of the bleeding gums with swelling, redness, exudate, and changes in the normal contour of insertion); 30% periodontitis (clinical semiology evolving towards progressive loss of the alveolar bone around the teeth); and 515% develop serious forms with ulceronecrotic gum damage and dental loss.
2: Importantly, periodontitis represents a risk factor for serious systemic diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases [ 5, 6, 7], or even the development of tumoral processes [ 8, 9, 10].
3: It was reported that the subgingival plaque of patients with periodontitis is associated with a number of genera, including  Filifactor, Treponema, Porphyromonas, Tannerella, Eubacterium, Peptostreptococcaceae, Desulfobulbus, Lachnospiraceae, Mogibacterium, Alloprevotella, Hallella, Phocaeicola, Johnsonella, and  Mycoplasma [ 11].
4: Dental plaque is an oral biofilm that has a central role in the development of periodontitis.
5: The most recent hypothesis explaining the involvement of dental plaque in periodontitis combines the concepts of the two earlier onesrespectively, the nonspecific and specific dental plaque hypothesesand was called the Ecological Plaque Hypothesis (1994), proposing that the periodontal disease is the result of an oral microbiota dysbiosis, resulting in the selection of certain pathogenic microorganisms.
6: This was changed into the Keystone-Pathogen Hypothesis (2012), proposing that certain low-abundant pathogens can cause inflammatory disease by interfering with the host immune system and remodeling the microbiota [ 12].
