0: Perioceutics involves the use of pharmacotherapeutic agents, including antimicrobial therapy and host modulatory therapy, specifically developed to manage periodontal disease [ 14].
1: Due to their complex composition of many active compounds with different targets, EOs seem to be a potential alternative to synthetic compounds, especially because of the resistance that has been increasingly developed by pathogenic microorganisms.
2: Due to a high number of constituents, EOs can interact with multiple target sites, like the destruction of the cytoplasm membrane or inhibition of protein synthesis and efflux pump, etc.
3: [ 15].
4: In the complex EO matrix, synergistic interactions between different components could occur.
5: An example is offered by terpenes, which have a modest antimicrobial activity, but they favor the entry of terpenoids in the cell where they exhibit their antimicrobial effect.
6: In addition, different terpenoids with aromatic structures could interact for the occurrence of the antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity [ 16].
7: Moreover, EOs are better tolerated in comparison with the synthetic antibacterial agents that are currently used for treatments of oral health problems, which are reported to cause several side effects such as diarrhea, vomiting, etc.
8: [ 17].
9: EOs could also increase the susceptibility of microorganisms to antibiotics commonly used in dental practice and stimulate the beneficial host response.
10: These are some of the advantages of using entire EOs instead of purified compounds.
11: In this context, the aim of the present study was to investigate the bacterial growth inhibition, antibiofilm, and immunomodulatory effects of  Salvia officinalis (sage),  Satureja hortensis (summer savory), and  Anethum graveolens (dill) essential oils against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria isolated from the subgingival dental plaque of patients with periodontitis.
