<p>It is extremely difficult to compare the studies that applied different essential oils because the results will be based on numerous factors, including essential composition, doses, extract methods and application, animal age, and housing conditions. The TEO feed additive, as an alternative to dietary antibiotics, is highly safe and could be utilized for improving the productive and reproductive performance of rabbits. The effects the phytogenic substances have on the intestinal health, antioxidant status, and antimicrobial activity are considered essential for the biological activities; however, studies lack the determination of active components, and their mechanisms are still not clear [

 <xref rid="B26-animals-10-01844" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Therefore, more studies under standardization are required to explore the mechanisms of TEO on rabbit production and reproduction. In the present study, the main active component of TEO was thymol which constitutes 40% of its analyzed composition. The composition of TEO used in the present study was consistent with that reported in the literature [

In the current study, it is observed that dietary TEO enhanced the productive performance associated with the present active component, thymol. The current study demonstrated that DBWG and FCR were improved in rabbits fed a control diet supplemented with TEO up to 180 mg/kg compared to PC and NC groups. These improvements may be because the active compounds (thymol and carvacrol) stimulated digestive enzymes, thus leading to the improvement in nutrient digestibility [
