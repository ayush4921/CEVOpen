<p>Blood biochemical analysis reflects internal organ integrity. In this direction, this study indicated that TEO did not cause obvious damage to any of the internal organs, including the kidney, liver, and heart. These obtained results can be confirmed by liver and kidney function. In the current study, supplementation of TEO to male rabbits significantly reduced serum urea, creatinine, and ALT and AST activities and increased serum testosterone levels compared to PC and NC groups, but the values were within the normal physiological range [

 <xref rid="B14-animals-10-01844" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], where it is reported that the activity of AST and ALT of rabbits was remarkably enhanced by oral administration of phytogenic additives (5 or 10 mg allicin/BW) compared to the control. Supplementation of 2.5% of thyme leaves to rabbit diets significantly decreased urea and creatinine [

 <xref rid="B31-animals-10-01844" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] demonstrated that thyme extracts at 100 mg/kg induced significant (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) reduction in creatinine and urea as well as ALT and AST of rabbits compared to the control group. However, Dieumou et al. [
 <xref rid="B32-animals-10-01844" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] reported that the administration of garlic and ginger oils via stomach tube in four doses, 0 (control), 10 mg/kg/day, 20 mg/kg/day, and 40 mg/kg/day, showed no clear variations recorded in ALT, AST and serum creatinine features due to ginger treatments. Shanoon et al. [
 <xref rid="B33-animals-10-01844" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] indicated that there were no obvious differences in serum ALT, AST and blood creatinine features, indicating that none of the examined three dosages of the oil administered to birds was harmful. In addition, Herve et al. [
 <xref rid="B34-animals-10-01844" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] found that the serum features of AST or ALT clearly decreased with 100 or 150 mg/kg BW of ginger roots oil when compared to control data, without any harmful outcomes on feed uptake and BW profits.
