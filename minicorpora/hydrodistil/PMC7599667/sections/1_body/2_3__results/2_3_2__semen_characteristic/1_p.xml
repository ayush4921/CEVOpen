 <xref rid="animals-10-01844-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> displays the effects of TEO on semen characteristics. Results demonstrated that TEO increased the sperm livability, sperm motility, and ejaculate volume compared with PC and NC groups at the end of treatments. Abnormal sperm was reduced (

However, no significant difference was observed in the semen pH values between treatments. Overall, the PC (oxytetracycline) exhibited a significant increase in semen quality compared to NC.
