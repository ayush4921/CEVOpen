Furthermore, the TEO supplementations at 60, 120, 180 mg/kg increased DBWG and improved FCR of male Californian rabbits compared to the PC and NC groups during the periods of 70–100, 100–130, and 70–130 days of age. The highest DBWG and most efficient FCR were found in the 180 mg, 120 mg, and 60 mg TEO groups, then the PC and NC. The weakest performance was recorded for the NC group compared with PC and TEO groups. In terms of the daily feed intake (DFI), the highest DFI was observed (
