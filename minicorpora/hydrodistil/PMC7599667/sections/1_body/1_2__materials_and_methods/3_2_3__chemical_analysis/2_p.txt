0: The gross energy (GE) contents of the diet and feces were measured using an adiabatic bomb calorimeter (Parr Instrument Company, Moline, IL, USA).
1: A digestibility trial was conducted using thirty 100-day-old male Californian rabbits to determine the dry matter (DM) and digestible energy (DE) of the basal diet according to Perez et al.
2: [ 19].
3: Rabbits were housed in individual metabolism cages (measuring width  length  height to be 50 cm  60 cm  40 cm).
4: A 10-day adaptation period was followed by continuous feces collection for 5 consecutive days (collection period).
5: Samples of daily feces of each rabbit were taken and oven dried at 60 C for 48 h, then was ground and stored for proximate chemical analysis.
6: Chemical analyses for the digestibility trial (DM and GE of diets and feces) were conducted at the Animal Nutrition Laboratory, Faculty of Agriculture, South Valley University, Egypt.
7: The DE refers to GE intake minus energy lost in feces according to Hall et al.
8: [ 20].
