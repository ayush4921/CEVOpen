<p>The gross energy (GE) contents of the diet and feces were measured using an adiabatic bomb calorimeter (Parr Instrument Company, Moline, IL, USA). A digestibility trial was conducted using thirty 100-day-old male Californian rabbits to determine the dry matter (DM) and digestible energy (DE) of the basal diet according to Perez et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-animals-10-01844" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Rabbits were housed in individual metabolism cages (measuring width × length × height to be 50 cm × 60 cm × 40 cm). A 10-day adaptation period was followed by continuous feces collection for 5 consecutive days (collection period). Samples of daily feces of each rabbit were taken and oven dried at 60 °C for 48 h, then was ground and stored for proximate chemical analysis. Chemical analyses for the digestibility trial (DM and GE of diets and feces) were conducted at the Animal Nutrition Laboratory, Faculty of Agriculture, South Valley University, Egypt. The DE refers to GE intake minus energy lost in feces according to Hall et al. [
