 <xref rid="B21-animals-10-01844" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The TEO was purchased from El Hawag Natural Oils Company, Cairo, Egypt. The TEO was extracted by hydrodistillation in a Clevenger-type apparatus for three hours. The TEO was analyzed at the Department of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants Research, National Research Centre, Egypt, by gas chromatography (Delsi 121C gas chromatograph). Constituents were identified by GC/MS, using a Sigma 300 apparatus attached to an HP 5970 300 mass spectrometer.
