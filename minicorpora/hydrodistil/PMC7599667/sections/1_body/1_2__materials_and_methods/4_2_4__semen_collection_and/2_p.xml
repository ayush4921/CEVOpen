<p>Assessments of live, dead, and abnormal sperms were performed by counting 200 sperm cells using an Eosin–Nigrosin staining mixture. Complete or partial, purple-stained sperm cells were considered nonviable, whereas nonstained sperm cells were considered viable. Percentages of motile sperms on a warm stage showing progressive forward movement were visually calculated in several microscopic fields under 100× magnification using light microscope.</p>
