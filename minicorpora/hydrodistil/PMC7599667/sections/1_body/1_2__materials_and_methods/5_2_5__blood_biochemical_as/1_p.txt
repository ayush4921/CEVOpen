0: At the end of the experimental period, rabbits were fasted 12 h prior to blood sampling.
1: The treated animals were anesthetized by intramuscular injection of ketamine and xylazine, and then 5 mL of blood was withdrawn from one of the external ear veins.
2: Blood samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 min, where the serum was collected and stored at 20 C until assayed for biochemical analysis.
3: Serum testosterone concentrations were measured by immunoassay using commercial kits (Monobind, Inc., Lake Forest, CA 92630, USA).
4: Liver enzymes, alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST); the kidney function markers, creatinine and urea, concentrations, were also measured using standard diagnostic kits (Monobind, Inc., Lake Forest, CA 92630, USA).
