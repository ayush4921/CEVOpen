<p>At the end of the experimental period, rabbits were fasted 12 h prior to blood sampling. The treated animals were anesthetized by intramuscular injection of ketamine and xylazine, and then 5 mL of blood was withdrawn from one of the external ear veins. Blood samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 min, where the serum was collected and stored at −20 °C until assayed for biochemical analysis. Serum testosterone concentrations were measured by immunoassay using commercial kits (Monobind, Inc., Lake Forest, CA 92630, USA). Liver enzymes, alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST); the kidney function markers, creatinine and urea, concentrations, were also measured using standard diagnostic kits (Monobind, Inc., Lake Forest, CA 92630, USA).</p>
