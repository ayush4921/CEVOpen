<p>The male Californian rabbits were assigned to five dietary treatment groups of 30 rabbits each. Dietary treatments included a basal diet as a negative control (NC), a basal diet supplemented with a 500 mg/kg oxytetracycline antibiotic as a positive control (PC), and a basal diet supplemented with 60, 120, or 180 mg/kg of TEO. The experiment period lasted for 60 days.

 <xref rid="B17-animals-10-01844" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Rabbits were individually identified, and their body weight (BW) values were recorded at day 0 (70 days old), mid-experiment (100 days old), and end of the experiment (130 days old). Daily body weight gain (DBWG) was calculated for each period per pen. Additionally, the feed consumption for each pen between weighing was determined through the measurement of feed residue on the same day as the rabbits were weighed. Feed conversion ratio (FCR) was calculated as feed per gain based on the weight of feed consumed divided by DBWG per pen. Besides, mortality was observed daily during the entire experimental period.
