0: The male Californian rabbits were assigned to five dietary treatment groups of 30 rabbits each.
1: Dietary treatments included a basal diet as a negative control (NC), a basal diet supplemented with a 500 mg/kg oxytetracycline antibiotic as a positive control (PC), and a basal diet supplemented with 60, 120, or 180 mg/kg of TEO.
2: The experiment period lasted for 60 days.
3: Table 1 presents the experimental ration ingredients and chemical composition.
4: The diets were formulated to contain adequate levels of nutrients for rabbits as per the National Research Council (NRC) [ 17].
5: Rabbits were individually identified, and their body weight (BW) values were recorded at day 0 (70 days old), mid-experiment (100 days old), and end of the experiment (130 days old).
6: Daily body weight gain (DBWG) was calculated for each period per pen.
7: Additionally, the feed consumption for each pen between weighing was determined through the measurement of feed residue on the same day as the rabbits were weighed.
8: Feed conversion ratio (FCR) was calculated as feed per gain based on the weight of feed consumed divided by DBWG per pen.
9: Besides, mortality was observed daily during the entire experimental period.
