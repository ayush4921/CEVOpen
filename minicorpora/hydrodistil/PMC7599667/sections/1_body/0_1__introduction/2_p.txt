0: The effects the phytogenic substances have on the intestinal, antioxidant status, and antimicrobial activity are considered essential for the biological activities.
1: Moreover, the thyme essential oil (TEO), as a phytogenic feed additive, can influence the rabbit performance and welfare positively [ 7].
2: Thyme ( Thymus vulgaris) is an aromatic plant that belongs to the Lamiaceae family, and great attention has been paid to its pharmaceutical and therapeutic effects.
3: Furthermore, supplementation of dietary thyme extract at 0.5 g/kg significantly improved gut integrity and antioxidant status of rabbits [ 8] mainly because of the thyme active components.
4: However, other studies have not observed any effect of the dietary inclusion of thyme on growth development [ 9] or the carcass of young rabbits [ 10].
5: The main components of TEO are thymol, carvacrol, -terpinene, p-cymene, -myrcene, linalool, and terpinen-4-ol [ 1, 11].
6: These active components had the best oxidative status [ 12] and may reduce serum cholesterol [ 13], which could improve the reproductive performance of rabbits.
7: El-Ratel et al.
8: [ 14] reported that oral administration of phytobiotics improved the liver function of rabbits compared to the control.
9: Similarly, supplementation of 2.5% of thyme leaves to rabbit diets remarkably enhanced kidney function by decreasing urea and creatinine levels [ 15].
10: However, no information is available regarding the effects of TEO, as alternatives to dietary antibiotic growth promoters, on the performance, semen quality, kidney and liver functions, and testosterone levels in male rabbits.
11: To explore the effects of TEO on the productive and physiological status of male rabbits, we investigated the efficiency of TEO as an alternative to antibiotics for improving the productive performance, testosterone levels, and liver and kidney functions of male rabbits.
