<p>The PMSM (2 g) was mixed with Tween‐80 (1 ml) and made up to 100 ml by distilled water followed by stirring and heating. Afterward, the PMSM solution was charged with CLEO (0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2% v/v). The buffalo meat slices were then immersed in the PMSM‐CLEO solutions for 1 min, air‐dried (10 min, 25°C), and stored at 4°C for 10 days. The coated samples were analyzed in terms of their physicochemical, textural, microbial, color, and sensory changes at time intervals of 0, 1, 4, 7, and 10 days.</p>
