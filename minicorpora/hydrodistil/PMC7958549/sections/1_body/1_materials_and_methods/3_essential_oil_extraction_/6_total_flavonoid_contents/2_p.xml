<p>The total flavonoid contents (TFC) of the CLEO was measured based on the method of Saki et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn32137-bib-0057" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). Briefly, the sample (0.5 ml) was charged with 300 µl of NaNO
 <sub>2</sub> solution (1:20 w/v) and the mixture was vortexed for 10 s and stored at room temperature for 5 min. In the next step, AlCl
 <sub>3</sub> (300 µl; 1:10 w/v), NaOH (1 M), and distilled water (1.9 ml) were added and mixed for 10 s. The absorbance of the mixture was read at 510 nm, and the TFC of the CLEO was expressed as mg quercetin equivalent (QE) per g of CLEO.
