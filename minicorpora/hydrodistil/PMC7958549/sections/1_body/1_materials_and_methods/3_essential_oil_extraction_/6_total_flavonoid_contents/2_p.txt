0: The total flavonoid contents (TFC) of the CLEO was measured based on the method of Saki et al.
1: ( 2019).
2: Briefly, the sample (0.5 ml) was charged with 300 l of NaNO 2 solution (1:20 w/v) and the mixture was vortexed for 10 s and stored at room temperature for 5 min.
3: In the next step, AlCl 3 (300 l; 1:10 w/v), NaOH (1 M), and distilled water (1.9 ml) were added and mixed for 10 s. The absorbance of the mixture was read at 510 nm, and the TFC of the CLEO was expressed as mg quercetin equivalent (QE) per g of CLEO.
