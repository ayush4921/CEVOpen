<p>The CLEO was subjected to a gas chromatograph (GC; Agilent 7890A) coupled to a mass spectrometer (MS; Agilent 5975C) to identify its main chemical compounds, according to the following conditions: 0.2 µl injection volume, 5°C/min heating rate, 70 eV ionization energy, helium gas with 1.1 ml/min rate, and DB‐5 capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 µm). The obtained retention profiles were finally compared with those of known samples analyzed by a GC‐MS apparatus with similar conditions (Alizadeh Behbahani et al.,
