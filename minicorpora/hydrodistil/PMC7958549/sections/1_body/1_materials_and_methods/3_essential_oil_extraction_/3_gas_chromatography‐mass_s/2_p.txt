0: The CLEO was subjected to a gas chromatograph (GC; Agilent 7890A) coupled to a mass spectrometer (MS; Agilent 5975C) to identify its main chemical compounds, according to the following conditions: 0.2 l injection volume, 5C/min heating rate, 70 eV ionization energy, helium gas with 1.1 ml/min rate, and DB5 capillary column (30 m  0.25 mm  0.25 m).
1: The obtained retention profiles were finally compared with those of known samples analyzed by a GCMS apparatus with similar conditions (Alizadeh Behbahani et al.,  2019a; Heydari et al.,  2020).
