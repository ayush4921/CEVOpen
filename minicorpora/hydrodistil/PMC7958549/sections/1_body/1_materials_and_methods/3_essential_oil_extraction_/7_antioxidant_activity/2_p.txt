0: DPPHradical scavenging (DPPHRS) activity of the CLEO was investigated by utilizing the method of Wollinger et al.
1: ( 2016).
2: To do this, 0.05 ml of CLEO was mixed with 3.95 ml of methanolic DPPH solution (0.1 mg/ml = 250 M) followed by incubation at room temperature and in a dark place for 60 min.
3: The methanol (0.05 ml) was applied to prepare the blank sample in the same way.
4: The absorbance of the sample (As) or blank (Ab) was measured at 518 nm, and the DPPHRS activity was calculated as below: DPPH-RSactivity (%)=[1-As/Ab]100
