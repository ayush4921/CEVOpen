<p>The method of Shan et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn32137-bib-0058" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>) with minor modification was used to determine the ABTS‐radical scavenging (ABTS‐RS) activity of the oil. Briefly, the same volumes of 7 mM ABTS solution and 2.45 mM K
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>8</sub> were mixed together and kept at 25°C for 16 hr under dark conditions. The obtained ABTS radical cation solution was then charged with methanol to reach 0.7 ± 0.2 absorbance at 734 nm. After that, the oil (0.1 ml) was mixed with the ABTS radical solution (3.9 ml) and the resulting solution was kept at ambient temperature for 6 min, which was followed by measuring its absorbance at 734 nm (As) against blank sample (methanol; Ac). The ABTS‐RS activity of the CLEO was calculated according to the following formula:
