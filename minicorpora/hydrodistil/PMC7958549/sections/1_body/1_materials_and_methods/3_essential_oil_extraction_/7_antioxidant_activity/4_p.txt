0: The inhibitory effect of the oil against bleaching of carotenelinoleate solution was evaluated according to the spectrophotometric method of Dapkevicius et al.
1: ( 1998).
2: The absorbance of the solution was determined at 490 nm after 120min incubation (As).
3: The control sample was prepared in the same way, and its absorbance (Ac) was recorded at the time zero and after 120min reaction.
4: The antioxidant potential of the CLEO was then measured as below: Inhibitoryeffect(%)=(As(120)Ac(120))/(Ac(0)Ac(120))100
