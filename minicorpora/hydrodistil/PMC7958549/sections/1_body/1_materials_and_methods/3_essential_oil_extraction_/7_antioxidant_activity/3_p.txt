0: The method of Shan et al.
1: ( 2005) with minor modification was used to determine the ABTSradical scavenging (ABTSRS) activity of the oil.
2: Briefly, the same volumes of 7 mM ABTS solution and 2.45 mM K 2S 2O 8 were mixed together and kept at 25C for 16 hr under dark conditions.
3: The obtained ABTS radical cation solution was then charged with methanol to reach 0.7  0.2 absorbance at 734 nm.
4: After that, the oil (0.1 ml) was mixed with the ABTS radical solution (3.9 ml) and the resulting solution was kept at ambient temperature for 6 min, which was followed by measuring its absorbance at 734 nm (As) against blank sample (methanol; Ac).
5: The ABTSRS activity of the CLEO was calculated according to the following formula: ABTSRSactivity(%)=[1As/Ac]100
