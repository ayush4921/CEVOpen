<p>The method of Ahmed et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn32137-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>) with some changes was employed to measure the TPC of CLEO. The oil (0.2 ml) or gallic acid (0.2 ml; 0–0.5 mg/ml) was mixed with 10% Folin‐Ciocalteu's reagent (2.5 ml). Then, Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> (2 ml; 7.50%) was added and the solution was incubated for 1 hr at ambient temperature. The absorbance was read at 756 nm, and the TPC of the CLEO was calculated and expressed as mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE) per g of CLEO.
