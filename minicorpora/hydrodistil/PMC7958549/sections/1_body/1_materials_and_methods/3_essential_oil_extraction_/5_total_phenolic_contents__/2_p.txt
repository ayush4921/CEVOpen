0: The method of Ahmed et al.
1: ( 2019) with some changes was employed to measure the TPC of CLEO.
2: The oil (0.2 ml) or gallic acid (0.2 ml; 00.5 mg/ml) was mixed with 10% FolinCiocalteu's reagent (2.5 ml).
3: Then, Na 2CO 3 (2 ml; 7.50%) was added and the solution was incubated for 1 hr at ambient temperature.
4: The absorbance was read at 756 nm, and the TPC of the CLEO was calculated and expressed as mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE) per g of CLEO.
