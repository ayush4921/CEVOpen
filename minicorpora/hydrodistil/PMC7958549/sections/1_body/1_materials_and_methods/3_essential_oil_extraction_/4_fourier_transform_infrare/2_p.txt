0: The functional groups of active compounds of the CLEO were analyzed by a Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectrometer.
1: To do this, the CLEO was mixed with potassium bromide and compressed to obtain an appropriate pellet.
2: The pellet was then subjected to the FTIR spectrometer, and the CLEO spectrum was collected from 400 to 4,000 wavenumber range (Alizadeh Behbahani, Falah, et al.,  2020).
