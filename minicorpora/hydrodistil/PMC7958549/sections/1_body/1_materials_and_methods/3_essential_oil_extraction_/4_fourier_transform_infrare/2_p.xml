<p>The functional groups of active compounds of the CLEO were analyzed by a Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectrometer. To do this, the CLEO was mixed with potassium bromide and compressed to obtain an appropriate pellet. The pellet was then subjected to the FTIR spectrometer, and the CLEO spectrum was collected from 400 to 4,000 wavenumber range (Alizadeh Behbahani, Falah, et al.,
