<p>A Stable Micro System Texture Analyzer (TA, XT2i, UK) was applied to determine the hardness changes of the meat samples during cold storage. To do this, the samples (2 × 2 × 2 cm) were compressed by a probe (36 mm in diameter) up to 50% of their initial heights at 5 mm/s test speed, and the highest force (N) was considered as the tissue hardness of the samples (Heydari et al.,
