0: The meat sample (5 g) was mixed with 0.1% peptone water (45 g) in a Stomacher and homogenized (200 rpm, 1.0 min).
1: The subsequent dilutions (10 1 to 10 6) were then prepared in the test tubes containing 0.1% peptone water.
2: The dilutions were inoculated into the plates containing culture medium and to perform the following microbial tests: total viable count (TVC) bacterial count in PCA (48 hr incubation at 37C), psychrotrophic count (PTC) in PCA (10 days of incubation at 7C),  S.  aureus count in MSA (24hr incubation at 37C),  E. coli count in EMB (24hr incubation at 37C), and Fungi count in SDA (72hr incubation at 27C) (Alizadeh Behbahani & Imani Fooladi,  2018b).
