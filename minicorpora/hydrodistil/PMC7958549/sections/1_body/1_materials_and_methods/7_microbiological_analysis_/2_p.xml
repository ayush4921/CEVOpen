<p>The meat sample (5 g) was mixed with 0.1% peptone water (45 g) in a Stomacher and homogenized (200 rpm, 1.0 min). The subsequent dilutions (10
 <sup>–1</sup> to 10
 <sup>–6</sup>) were then prepared in the test tubes containing 0.1% peptone water. The dilutions were inoculated into the plates containing culture medium and to perform the following microbial tests: total viable count (TVC) bacterial count in PCA (48 hr incubation at 37°C), psychrotrophic count (PTC) in PCA (10 days of incubation at 7°C),
