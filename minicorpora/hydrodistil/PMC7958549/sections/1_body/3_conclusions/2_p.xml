<p>The quality and shelf‐life of meat and meat products could be significantly affected by microbial growth and lipid oxidation. The edible coating based on 
 <italic>Plantago major</italic> seed mucilage and 
 <italic>Citrus limon</italic> essential oil effectively decreased the lipid oxidation, hardness loss, and microbial growth in the buffalo meat during cold storage. The coated meat had also a higher consumer acceptance compared to the control sample. Therefore, 
 <italic>Citrus limon</italic> essential oil‐rich 
 <italic>Plantago major</italic> seed mucilage based edible coatings have the potential to maintain/improve the characteristics of meat products during the shelf‐life.
