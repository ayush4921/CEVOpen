<p>Modern packaging technologies have the potential to prolong the shelf‐life of food products through inhibiting or delaying lipid oxidation and microbial growth. Synthetic packaging have been extensively applied for these purposes; however, due to the negative impact of the residues of these packaging systems on the environment, food industry experts have been motivated to develop novel environmentally friendly packaging systems such as edible films and coatings to preserve food quality during storage (Heydari et al.,

Currently, the natural polymer‐originated edible coatings, particularly polysaccharide‐based ones, are used as biodegradable and environmentally friendly packaging to preserve the quality, minimize the loss of volatile nutraceuticals and moisture, and increase the storage stability of food products (Alizadeh Behbahani, Yazdi, Shahidi, Mortazavi, et al.,
