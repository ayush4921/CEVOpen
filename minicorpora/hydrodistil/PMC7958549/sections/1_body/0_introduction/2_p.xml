<p>Buffalo meat is considered as an alternative source of meat and a healthy choice due to the absence of hormones and stimulants. It is also rich in iron and protein and has lower contents of fat and cholesterol in comparison with skinless chicken, pork, and beef meats. It is also worth noting that buffalo meat has a red brilliant colour because of very low contents of intramuscular fat. However, buffalo meat, as other types of fresh meat, is a very perishable food. And the presence of spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms on the surface of buffalo meat could affect safety, hygienic quality, and shelf‐life of the product (Cannarsi et al.,
