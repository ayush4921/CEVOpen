 <italic>Plantago major</italic> is a flowering plant from the family 
 <italic>Plantaginaceae</italic>. It has a large amount of small and ellipsoidal seeds, and the presence of polysaccharides in the seed coat make it to be gummy under warm and humid conditions. The polysaccharides are comprised of arabinose, xylose, rhamnose, galactose, glucose, glucuronic acid, and galacturonic acid and have the ability to be used as active natural polymers for developing edible coatings (Alizadeh Behbahani, Shahidi, et al.,

In this way, the edible coatings loaded with plant essential oils and extracts have been successfully developed for inhibiting or reducing oxidation and microbial growth in various food products (Choulitoudi et al.,
