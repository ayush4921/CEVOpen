<p>In recent years, global demands have been raised for marinated meat products. The reasons for this are majorly associated with the nutritional properties, the extended shelf‐life in addition to the enhancement of the sensory and textural properties of this type of food (Barbut et al.,

 <xref rid="fsn32137-bib-0060" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Moreover, marination makes it possible to variegate meat products and to present more choices to consumers. Marination is a broadly employed technic in the meat industry comprising the injection or immersion of meat cuts into aqueous solutions consisting of a variety of components like water, salt, lemon juice, vinegar, brine, soy sauce, herbs, essential oils, tenderizers, spices, and organic acids (Garcia‐Marquez et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32137-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>; Kargiotou et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32137-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>; Siroli et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32137-bib-0060" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). In general, marination of a meat cut is normally carried out to enhance the production efficiency (i.e., by elevating the product moisture content), ameliorate the sensory properties of the resulting product, and, eventually, restrict (or at least postpone) oxidative reactions (Alvarado &amp; McKee, 
 <xref rid="fsn32137-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>; Siroli et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32137-bib-0060" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>; Vlakhova‐Vangelova &amp; Dragoev,

 <xref rid="fsn32137-bib-0072" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). Furthermore, earlier works have shown that the marinade solutions containing “natural” components (e.g., spices, herbs, essential oils) can have antimicrobial effect on pathogens and spoilage microorganisms in poultry, beef, and pork meat. Apart from their capability of enhancing the safety and shelf‐life of marinated meat, the application of ingredients like essential oils may also improve consumers’ willingness to purchase, in light of the recent growing attitude towards the consumption of clean‐label products (Asioli et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32137-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>; Karam et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32137-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>; Pathania et al.,
