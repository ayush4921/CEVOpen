<p>Color is considered as one of the main factors in determining meat quality.

 <xref rid="fsn32137-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6a–d</xref>. As storage time increased from 1 to 10 days, there was a significant decrease in 
 <italic>L</italic>* values, representing that the buffalo meat samples become darker (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32137-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>). However, the samples wrapped with PMSM + 0.5%CLEO and PMSM + 1.5%CLEO were significantly lighter at the end of storage period, compared with control and other coated pairs (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). A significant decrease in 
 <italic>a</italic>* value was also observed in all samples as a function of storage time and the samples become less red (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32137-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>). This was more pronounced in the coated samples, which could be related to the conversion of myoglobin to metmyoglobin under low‐oxygen pressure conditions of the PMSM coatings in conjugation with exudate accumulation in the coated samples (Vital et al.,
