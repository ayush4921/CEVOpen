<p>It is also noteworthy that although the coated samples had initially higher 
 <italic>b</italic>* values than the noncoated control one (likely due to the yellowish color of the coating), there was a significant decrease in 
 <italic>b</italic>* values of the buffalo meat samples during storage (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32137-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>). This could be probably attributed to the fact that the samples became darker over time. Moreover, all of the meat samples underwent a significant increase in total color change as storage time increased (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32137-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6d</xref>). And the PMSM + 2%CLEO‐coated buffalo meat had a smaller total change in comparison to the other counterparts, probably indicating its shelf‐life extension. In congruent with our study, it has been reported that coated meat samples that show a smaller total change would have an extension in shelf‐life (Antoniewski et al.,
