<p>The CLEO‐loaded edible coatings did not affect the sensory properties of the buffalo meat over storage period (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32137-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7a–e</xref>). From the panelist’ points of view, the meat samples with a sensory score above 4 could be accepted (Heydari et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32137-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). All of the sensory properties were decreased as storage time increased and the control sample was unacceptable after 10 days storage at 4°C. However, the coated buffalo meats were acceptable throughout the storage period, except for the PMSM coated sample, which it perceived a texture score of 3.58 at the end of storage time (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32137-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7d</xref>). In general, the noncoated and coated meat samples had the shelf lives of 7 and 10 days, respectively, according to the overall acceptance results (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32137-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7e</xref>). And the lowest and highest sensory scores were observed in the control and meat samples wrapped with PMSM + 2% CLEO, respectively. This could be confirmed by the lipid oxidation and microbial growth progressions in the samples; the PMSM + 2% CLEO‐coated meat sample had the highest stability to the lipid oxidation and microbial spoilage in comparison to the control sample. Indeed, the antioxidant and antimicrobial function of the essential oil‐loaded edible coatings make them to be used as food‐grade preservatives to inhibit the lipid oxidation and microbial growth of the meat and meat products, thereby improving their shelf‐lives (Guerrero et al.,
