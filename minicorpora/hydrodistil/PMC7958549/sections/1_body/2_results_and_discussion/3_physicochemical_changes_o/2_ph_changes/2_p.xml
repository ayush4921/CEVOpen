 <xref rid="fsn32137-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3a</xref> shows the pH change of the coated buffalo meats during storage period at 4°C. Despite the fact that the samples underwent a gradual pH increase during storage, there were no significant differences among the samples (

The application of edible coating on the meat samples resulted in lower pH changes, and the CLEO‐loaded coatings, especially 2% CLEO loaded ones (PMSM + 2%CLEO) were more efficient than the others; the buffalo meat coated by PMSM + 2%CLEO showed the lowest changes in pH value (5.6–5.66) as the storage period rose from 1 to 10 days, compared to the control sample (

Indeed, microbial‐based enzymatic activities have the potential to degrade meat proteins to nitrogenous compounds like trimethylamine and ammonia with basic nature and the pH value could be subsequently increased during storage. However, the edible coatings rich in essential oils could reduce the permeability of carbon dioxide from the coating and the accumulation of this acidic compound could therefore lead to pH decrease in the sample and in turn microbial growth suppression (Alizadeh Behbahani, Noshad, et al.,
