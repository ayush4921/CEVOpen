<p>As can be seen from Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32137-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>, all samples underwent a significant decrease in moisture content as a function of storage time (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). The control sample showed an approximately 22.95% water loss at 10 days of storage; however, the water loss in the coated samples ranged from 11.43% in PMSM + 0%CLEO to 4.33% in PMSM + 2%CLEO by the end of storage period. And the higher CLEO loads in the edible coating, the lower was the water loss. This means that the CLEO‐loaded PMSM coatings inhibited the weight loss of the buffalo meat efficiently and could be applied to preserve its freshness for a longer period of time. This positive effect of the edible coating could be due to its lower permeability to water vapor and physical barrier function (Xiong et al.,
