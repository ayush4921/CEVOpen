<p>The changes of peroxide value of buffalo meat coated by the CLEO‐PMSM are illustrated in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32137-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>. The control and coated meat samples experienced an increase in the peroxide value as the storage time increased. By the end of storage period, there were significant differences in the peroxide value between the control meat and the wrapped ones, representing lower peroxide values of 0.31, 0.22, 0.2, 0.17, and 0.14 meq O
 <sub>2</sub>/kg in PMSM + 0%CLEO, PMSM + 0.5%CLEO, PMSM + 1%CLEO, PMSM + 1.5%CLEO, and PMSM + 2%CLEO, respectively, compared to the peroxide value of 1 meq O
 <sub>2</sub>/kg in the noncoated sample. It could be therefore concluded that the edible coating, especially high‐essential oil‐loaded ones, is effective in preventing the formation of hydroperoxide in the buffalo meat during storage period. This could be mainly due to the radical scavenging activity and hydroperoxide formation‐suppressing potential of essential oils (Barzegar et al.,
