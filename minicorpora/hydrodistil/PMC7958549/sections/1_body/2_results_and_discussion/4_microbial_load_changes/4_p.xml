<p>The changes in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> populations of buffalo meat, including control and samples coated by PMSM and CLEO‐loaded PMSM, stored at 4°C for up to 10 days are indicated in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32137-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4c,d</xref>. The initial 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> counts in all samples were in the range of 0.09–0.30 and 0.13–0.24 log CFU/g, respectively. All the coated samples remarkably decreased the population of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> as compared with the control at the end of storage time; the maximum count of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (2.00 log CFU/g) and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (2.67 log CFU/) were found in the noncoated buffalo meat, and the sample wrapped with PMSM + 2% CLEO showed the lowest 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (1 log CFU/g) and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (1.17 log CFU/g) populations (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05).
