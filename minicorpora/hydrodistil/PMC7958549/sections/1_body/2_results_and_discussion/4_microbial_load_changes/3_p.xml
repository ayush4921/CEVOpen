<p>The PTC in buffalo meat was significantly influenced (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) by the edible coating and storage time (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32137-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). All the samples underwent a significant increase in the PTC during storage, and the highest (~ 6.89 log CFU/g) and lowest (~ 2.99 log CFU/g) PTC changes were observed in the control and PMSM + 2%CLEO coated meats, respectively. Indeed, the PTC indicated the same pattern as that of TVC, with control (noncoated) meat also being the highest by the storage time (9.70 ± 0.63 log CFU/g), followed by the buffalo meats coated by PMSM + 0%CLEO (6.00 ± 0.29 log CFU/g), PMSM + 0.5%CLEO (5.50 ± 0.5 log CFU/g), PMSM + 1%CLEO (4.93 ± 0.49 log CFU/g), PMSM + 1.5%CLEO (4.09 ± 0.17 log CFU/g), and PMSM + 2%CLEO (3.83 ± 0.26 log CFU/g). This positive effect of the CLEO‐loaded edible coating could be ascribed to the antimicrobial property of the CLEO and the oxygen barrier function of the coating. In this way, the growth of aerobic psychrotrophic bacteria (like 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> species), as the main cause of the meat spoilage under aerobic conditions, is suppressed under low‐oxygen pressure (Alghooneh et al.,
