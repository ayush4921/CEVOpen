<p>The effect of the PMSM coatings loaded with different CLEO concentrations on the TVC changes in buffalo meat during storage period is indicated in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32137-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>. The TVC increased significantly in all samples as the storage time increased (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). The control sample had the highest TVC increment (~ 3.89‐fold) during storage, and the buffalo meat coated by PMSM + 2%CLEO presented the lowest change in TVC (~ 3.28‐fold); the higher the CLEO concentrations in the edible coatings, the lower were the changes in TVC of the meat samples. It is reported that 10
 <sup>7</sup> CFU/g (7 log CFU/g) is the maximum recommendation limit of TVC for fresh meat (ICMSF, 
 <xref rid="fsn32137-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">1986</xref>). In this context, the sample wrapped with 2% CLEO‐loaded PMSM had a TVC of 6.83 log CFU/g by the day 10 of storage, whilst the TVC in the control sample exceeded the maximum recommendation limit at 7 days (9.62 log CFU/g). This indicates microbial shelf‐lives of about 4–6 days for the noncoated buffalo meat and more than 10 days for the 2% CLEO‐loaded PMSM‐coated meat. Thus, the CLEO‐rich edible coatings have the potential to increase the shelf‐life of buffalo meat significantly, mainly due to the antimicrobial activity of the oil, in line with other studies (Guerrero et al.,
