<p>A similar behavior was observed for the growth pattern of fungi (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32137-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>). The CLEO‐rich PMSM coatings manifestly reduced the growth of fungi on the buffalo meat surface. The control and the sample coated by PMSM + 2% CLEO had the highest and lowest fungi populations of 2.50 and 1.17 log CFU/g at the end of storage period, respectively. This is mainly due to the fact that the oxygen‐barrier function of the edible coating makes it to be an inappropriate place for the growth of aerobic fungi species (Heydari et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32137-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). The anti‐fungal effect of the CLEO could be an another factor in reducing the population of fungi in buffalo meat during storage (Ammad et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32137-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). In accordance with our results, it has been reported that 
 <italic>Zataria multiflora</italic> essential oil and grape seed extract reduced the growth of mesophilic, psychrotrophic, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spp., lactic acid bacteria, and yeast strains in raw buffalo patty during cold storage (Tajik et al.,
