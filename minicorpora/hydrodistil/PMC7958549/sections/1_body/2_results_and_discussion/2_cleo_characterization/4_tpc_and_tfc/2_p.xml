<p>The mean values of TPC and TFC of CLEO were 38.91 ± 0.44 mg GAE/g and 87.90 ± 0.63 mg QE/g, respectively. According to the results of Abad‐García et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn32137-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>), five different classes of phenolic compounds are found in 
 <italic>Citrus</italic> species: flavanone (such as O‐dihexoside of naringenin), flavones (such as luteolin‐6‐C‐glucoside, apigenin‐7‐O‐rutinoside‐4′‐O‐glucoside, apigenin‐6‐C‐hexoside‐O‐hexoside, luteolin‐7‐O‐neohesperidoside‐4′‐O‐glucoside, and aligenin‐8‐C‐hexoside‐O‐acylrhamnoside), flavonols (such as 7‐O‐rutinosides of isorhamnetin, kaempferol, quercetin, and tamarixetin, isorhamnetin‐3‐O‐rutinoside‐7‐O‐glucoside, kaempferol‐3‐O‐rutinoside, and tamarixetin‐3‐O‐rutinoside‐7‐O‐glucoside), hydroxycinnamic acids (such as O‐hexoside of sinapic and ferulic acids), and coumarins (such as O‐rhamnosylhexoside and O‐hexoside of scopoletin). The high contents of phenolic compounds have been found in 
 <italic>citrus</italic> species essential oils and extracts (Di Rauso Simeone et al.,
