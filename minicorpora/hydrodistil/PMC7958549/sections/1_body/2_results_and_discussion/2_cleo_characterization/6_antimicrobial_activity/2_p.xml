<p>The antimicrobial effect of the CLEO on the spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms is illustrated in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32137-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. The oil had a remarkable antibacterial effect against Gram‐positive and Gram‐negative bacterial species; however, its effect was dependent on the microorganism type. In the DDA test, 
 <italic>L. innocua</italic> and 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>, with the inhibition zones (IZ) of 14.10 and 13.90 mm, respectively, were the most sensitive species to the CLEO; whilst, the most resistant microorganism was 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> with IZ of 7.20 mm (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32137-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). It could be also noted that the Gram‐positive bacterial species were generally more sensitive than the Gram‐negative ones (12.44 mm vs. 9.83 mm IZ). In general, the CLEO had significantly lower inhibitory effect (IZ = 11.46 mm) compared to the common antibiotics gentamicin (IZ = 23.37 mm), tetracycline (IZ = 21.66 mm), and chloramphenicol (IZ = 20.15). According to the results of WDA antimicrobial assay, 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> were the most sensitive and resistant species to the CLEO, respectively (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32137-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). And the average inhibition zone was found to be 10.2 mm for Gram‐negative bacteria and 14.4 mm for Gram‐positive bacteria. This difference in the sensitivity of the microorganisms to the CLEO could be mainly attributed to the complex structure of lipopolysaccharide cell membrane of the Gram‐negative bacteria compared to the single‐layer mucopeptidic structure of the Gram‐positive's cell membranes, which have the potential to decrease the diffusion of hydrophobic compounds across the membrane (Alizadeh Behbahani &amp; Imani Fooladi,
