<p>The CLEO was subjected to FTIR spectroscopy for identifying its functional groups (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32137-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The broad peak around 3,437 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> is likely due to –OH stretching, the strong peak at 2,927 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> is due to –CH stretching, and small peaks located at 1,377, 1,454, 1,642 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> could be assigned to the C=C aromatic ring bending of the bioactive compounds of the CLEO (Sotelo‐Boyás et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32137-bib-0061" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Additionally, it was claimed that the characteristic peak indicating the bending vibration of =CH for the disubstituted double bond of the limonene is located around 889 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (Akolade et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32137-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). It is also noteworthy that the peaks at 3,076 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and 2,872–2,962 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> could be probably attributed to the = C‐H and aliphatic C‐H of the limonene (Ansarifar et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32137-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). Likewise, some peaks were observed at 1,247 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (=C‐H in‐plane bending of aromatic rings and ‐CH
 <sub>2</sub> swing in alkanes), 1,176 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (C‐O stretching vibration), 1,036 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (C‐OH deformation vibration), and 759 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (=CH vibration of benzene ring) (Alizadeh Behbahani et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32137-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2019b</xref>). These aforementioned characteristic peaks indicate the presence of phenolic and aromatic compounds in the CLEO.
