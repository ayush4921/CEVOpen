<p>It has been demonstrated that a synergy among chemical compounds of plant essential oils determines their antioxidant potential and this bioactive activity is primarily influenced by the main compounds of the oil (Alizadeh Behbahani, Noshad, et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32137-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>; Farahmandfar &amp; Tirgarian, 
 <xref rid="fsn32137-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). The CLEO was therefore subjected to different in‐vitro antioxidant assays, namely DPPH‐RS activity, ABTS‐RS activity, and β‐carotene bleaching, to evaluate its potential antioxidant activity. In DPPH‐RS activity method, potent antioxidants react with DPPH free radicals and convert them to nonradical DPPH‐H molecules and the intense violet color of the reaction medium is subsequently changed to the colorless one (Fan et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32137-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). The CLEO had a remarkable DPPH‐RS activity (55.70 ± 0.46%), representing the potential of the bioactive CLEO to neutralize free radicals, mainly due to electron donation. The ABTS‐RS activity is however based on the reduction of ABTS
 <sup>●+</sup> to ABTS, through hydrogen atom transfer mechanism, in the presence of antioxidant agents (Jordão et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32137-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). The ABTS‐RS activity of the CLEO was found to be 63.82 ± 0.89%. This means that the CLEO is able to scavenge ABTS free radicals 
 <italic>via</italic> transferring hydrogen atoms. The inhibitory effect of the oil against β‐carotene discoloration was remarkable, as well (51.85 ± 0.67%). Potential antioxidant activity of the CLEO is therefore due to the presence of phenolic compounds and limonene in the oil as their antioxidative function (
 <italic>via</italic> electron and hydrogen atom donation) have been reported in the literature (Baschieri et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32137-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>; Campêlo et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32137-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>; Roberto et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32137-bib-0056" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). Accordingly, the CLEO could be employed as a natural antioxidant to inhibit lipid oxidation reactions and improve oxidative stability of food products.
