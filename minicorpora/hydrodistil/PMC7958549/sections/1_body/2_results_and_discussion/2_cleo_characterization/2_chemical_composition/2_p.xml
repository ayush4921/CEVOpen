<p>A total of 19 compounds were identified in the CLEO by the GC‐MS technique, which constituted 93.26% of the total oil (Table 
 <xref rid="fsn32137-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Limonene (40.5%) was the main compound of the CLEO, followed by carene (15.4%), α‐terpineol (7.61%), terpinen‐4‐ol (6.16%), β‐bisabolene (5.53%), octadecenoic acid (3.55%), and caryophyllene (3.11%). Similarly, Jomaa et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn32137-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>) reported that limonene (61.8%–73.8%) is the main identified compound in the CLEO extracted from the fruit peel, and γ‐terpinene (9.4%–10.4%), β‐pinene (3.7%–6.9%), O‐cymene (1%–2.4%), and citral (0.8%–5.4%) are found at lower concentrations in the oil. Also, it was demonstrated that the main components of the CLEO’s fruit peel are monoterpenoids, such as limonene (69.9%), pinene (11.2%), terpinene (8.21%), sabinene (3.9%), myrcene (3.1%), geranial (E‐citral, 2.9%), neral (Z‐citral, 1.5%), and linalool (1.41%) (Klimek‐Szczykutowicz et al.,

Although limonene has been found as the major compound of CLEO in all above‐mentioned studies, the minor differences between the concentrations of the chemical compounds could be due to fact that the quality and quantity of the essential oil is mainly dependent on the variety, growth stage, climate, growth location, and collection time of the bioactive plant (Kiarsi et al.,
