<p>The hardness of control and coated meat samples showed a decreasing trend throughout the storage period, and the hardness of the buffalo meat was not adversely influenced by the edible coating (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32137-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The samples coated by PMSM, especially CLEO‐rich coatings, showed higher hardness compared with the noncoated one; the highest and lowest hardness losses were observed in the control and PMSM + 2% CLEO samples (22.40% vs. 14.83%). Indeed, the higher essential oil concentration in the edible coating, the higher was buffalo meat hardness. According to the study of Ghani et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn32137-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>), essential oils have the potential to inhibit the growth of microorganisms and the activity of endogenous enzymes of meat (e.g., collagenase, cathepsins, and calpains). Myofibrillar and collagen proteins could be therefore inhibited from the enzymatic degradation, so meat texture preserves over time. Similar results have been reported by Kiarsi et al. (
