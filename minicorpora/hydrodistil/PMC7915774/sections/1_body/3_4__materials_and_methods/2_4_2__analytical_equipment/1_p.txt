0: Terpenes were extracted from oil using the VASE 5800 system (Entech Instruments, Simi Valley, CA, USA).
1: The system is based on extraction of volatile and semivolatile compounds into a trap filled with adsorbent (usually Tenax) with the aid of vacuum.
2: The trap (sorbent pen) has a special construction that allows evacuation of air using a vacuum pump from the vessel/vial in which sampling is performed.
3: After extraction, the vacuum from the vial is released, and the trap is inserted into a special thermal desorber, being part of the system, mounted as an injection port in GC/MS and controlled by the instruments electronic pressure control (EPC).
4: The system, apart from thermal desorber, consisted of a sorbent pen conditioner, controller, software for desorption process control, and membrane pump providing a vacuum of 28 Hg.
5: Sorbent pens used in the experiment were filled with Tenax.
6: VASE 5800 system was mounted on a single quadrupole GC/MS system (7890A/7895 TAD MSD, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with a DB-5MS column (30 m  0.25 mm  0.50 m, Agilent Technologies).
7: Helium at the flow of 1 mL/min was used as a carrier gas.
8: The following GC oven program was used for analyses: initial temperature 40 C for 3 min, then, an increase of 10 C/min to 180 C, and 20 C/min to 280 C (kept for 4 min).
9: GC/MS transfer line was kept at 290 C. Mass spectrometer was working in full scan mode in an  m/ z range 33333, 6.6 scans/s.
10: All peak area comparisons, as well as quantitation, was performed for total ion current (TIC) peaks.
11: Terpenes were identified based on comparison with NIST 02 library, and for selected compounds, by comparison with authentic standards.
12: Mass Hunter version 07.00.0 was used for controlling GC/MS system.
13: The following parameters were used for VASE 5800 desorption system: preheat; duration: 2 min at 260 C. Injection; split (1:25) achieved by splitter frit.
14: Desorption; standby temperature 70 C, duration 15 min desorption temperature 260 C, desorption time 20 min.
15: Bakeout; time 5 min at 260 C. Post bake; duration 4 min, temperature 70 C.
