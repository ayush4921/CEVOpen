0: Coriander oil was weighted into 44 mL screw top amber vials; the vials were capped with Teflon lined caps.
1: Before analysis, the Teflon lined caps were replaced by special Entech metal caps, which could seal the sorbent pen for sampling.
2: After inserting the sorbent pen into the vial, air was evacuated from the vial via the sorbent pen using a membrane pump with a manometer.
3: Once the vacuum in a vial reached 28 Hg (after approximately 15 s), the pump was disconnected and extraction of volatile compounds began.
4: When needed, the vials were heated in a metal block.
5: Different sample sizes were tested (2000 mg, 1000 mg and 200 mg), as well as different extraction temperatures (60 C, 40 C, and 20 C), and extraction times (3 min, 5 min, 10 min, and 20 min).
6: Quantitative analysis was performed using refined rapeseed oil as a matrix into which terpene standards were dissolved directly (approximately 200 mg per compound in 20 mL of oil); then, serial dilutions were prepared.
