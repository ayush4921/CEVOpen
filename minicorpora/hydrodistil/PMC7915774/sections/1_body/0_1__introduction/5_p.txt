0: Headspace analysis is a routine extracting method of food product samples with a number of advantages.
1: The most popular method of extracting volatile compounds from food is solid-phase microextraction (SPME); however, the most important limitation of this method is the difficult extraction of compounds with low Henrys law volatility constants.
2: Vacuum assisted sorbent extraction (VASE) is a novel approach for headspace sorbent extraction and only a few papers have been published demonstrating the potential of the technique.
3: Application of vacuum increases the yield of the extraction process of compounds that are difficult to extract, with the use of commercialized sorbent traps [ 13].
4: The sorbent traps are filled with a significant amount of Tenax (equivalent to approximately 500 times the volume typically used for SPME), which additionally supports exhaustive extraction [ 14].
5: Moreover, as the traps used in VASE are closed and vacuum is the driving force for extraction, there are no issues related to breakthrough volumes often present for purge and trap methods and other forms of dynamic headspace.
