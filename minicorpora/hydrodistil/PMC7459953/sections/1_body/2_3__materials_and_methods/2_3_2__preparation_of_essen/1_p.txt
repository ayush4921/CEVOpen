0: All the plant materials were air-dried in the shade for 7 days at room temperature and powdered using a mortar and pestle to get particles of a uniform, reduced size.
1: Preparation of the essential oil samples was achieved by hydrodistillation of the air-dried aerial parts of the different  Ferula species,  F. caratavica ( Fc),  F. kuchistanica (Fk),  F. pseudoreoselinum ( Fp),  F. samarcandica ( Fs),  F. tenuisecta  (Ft) and  F. varia ( Fv) for 2 h by Clevenger-type apparatus.
2: Anhydrous Na 2SO 4 was used to dehydrate the prepared essential oils, yielding 0.4, 0.7, 0.3, 0.3, 0.8 and 0.5 % v/w of dry weight for  Fc,  Fk,  Fp,  Fs,  Ft and  Fv, respectively.
3: Then the various oil samples were maintained at 30 C in dark-colored stoppered glasses until their analyses [ 26, 27].
