<p>The essential oils obtained from different 
 <italic>Ferula</italic> species, 
 <italic>F. caratavica</italic>, 
 <italic>F. kuchistanica</italic>, 
 <italic>F. pseudoreoselinum</italic>, 
 <italic>F. samarcandica</italic>, 
 <italic>F. tenuisecta</italic> and 
 <italic>F. varia</italic> showed significant variation as revealed by GC analyses. Furthermore, this variation became more clearly observable when coupled with a chemometric approach as represented by PCA used as an unsupervised pattern recognition technique. Additionally, the obtained essential oils showed notable antioxidant as well as tyrosinase and Î±-amylase inhibitory activities with variable degrees, which is mainly related to the differences in the secondary metabolites that predominate in the oils. Thus, it was concluded that the different 
 <italic>Ferula</italic> species could serve as a promising natural antioxidant drug that could be included in different products and used as spices to alleviate hyperglycemia and as a natural ingredient in pharmaceutical cosmetics to counteract hyperpigmentation. Chemometric study based on gathering the different biological activities of many additional 
 <italic>Ferula</italic> species will be considered. It is recommended that further in vivo studies such as animal and bioavailability studies be carried out to confirm the obtained results.
