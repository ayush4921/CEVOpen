0: This study aimed to investigate the contents of the essential oil from six  Ferula species growing in Uzbekistan, namely,  F. caratavica ( Fc),  F. kuchistanica ( Fk),  F. pseudoreoselinum ( Fp),  F. samarcandica ( Fs),  F. tenuisecta ( Ft) and  F. varia ( Fv) using GC analyses.
1: Discrimination of these species was carried by coupling the data obtained from GC-analyses with chemometrics employing unsupervised pattern recognition techniques represented by principal component analysis (PCA).
2: Furthermore, the antioxidant potential of the different essential oil samples using different assays, namely, 2,2-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS), cupric reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC), ferric reducing power (FRAP), and the phosphomolybdenum (PM) assay were evaluated  in vitro.
3: In addition, an evaluation of the possible enzymatic inhibitory activities of essential oils against tyrosinase and -amylase was done using standard in vitro bioassays.
