<p>This study aimed to investigate the contents of the essential oil from six 
 <italic>Ferula</italic> species growing in Uzbekistan, namely, 
 <italic>F. caratavica</italic> (
 <italic>Fc</italic>), 
 <italic>F. kuchistanica</italic> (
 <italic>Fk</italic>), 
 <italic>F. pseudoreoselinum</italic> (
 <italic>Fp</italic>), 
 <italic>F. samarcandica</italic> (
 <italic>Fs</italic>), 
 <italic>F. tenuisecta</italic> (
 <italic>Ft</italic>) and 
 <italic>F. varia</italic> (
 <italic>Fv</italic>) using GC analyses. Discrimination of these species was carried by coupling the data obtained from GC-analyses with chemometrics employing unsupervised pattern recognition techniques represented by principal component analysis (PCA). Furthermore, the antioxidant potential of the different essential oil samples using different assays, namely, 2,2′-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS), cupric reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC), ferric reducing power (FRAP), and the phosphomolybdenum (PM) assay were evaluated 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. In addition, an evaluation of the possible enzymatic inhibitory activities of essential oils against tyrosinase and α-amylase was done using standard in vitro bioassays.
