<p>Tyrosinase enzyme is an oxidase enzyme containing copper that assists in the completion of the first two steps of mammalian melanogenesis, which leads to undesirable hyperpigmentation. Thus, the search for effective tyrosinase inhibitors has recently become vital so that they can be incorporated in cosmetics for effective skin whitening and to counteract hyperpigmentation [

 <italic>Fk</italic> showed the most effective tyrosinase inhibitory potential, which was estimated as 119.67 mgKAE/g oil followed by 
 <italic>Fv</italic>, which showed an inhibitory potential equivalent to 118.42 mgKAE/g oil, where KAE is a Kojic acid equivalent, a potent tyrosinase inhibitory drug. 
 <italic>Fv</italic> oil is rich in 10,13 docosadienoic acid methyl ester, a polyunsaturated fatty acid, which greatly accounts for its promise as a tyrosinase inhibitor [

The underlying tyrosinase inhibitory mechanism mainly relies on the essential oils being rich in components that possess a hydrophobic portion that competitively inhibits the active sites of tyrosinase enzyme with subsequent interference of melanin synthesis. This inhibition may be achieved via interaction with Cu
 <sup>+2</sup> that exists in the active sites of tyrosinase in addition to the prohibition of tautomerization to dopachrome triggered by the oil, which behaves as a reducing agent and blocks of the oxidation reaction during the formation of melanin intermediates during the conversion of tyrosinase/DOPA into melanin, thus reducing skin pigmentation [
