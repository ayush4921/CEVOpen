<p>The antioxidant potential of the different essential oil samples was performed in vitro using the 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), the cupric ion reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC), The ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and the phosphomolybdenum method (PM) assays. The results displayed in 
 <xref rid="antibiotics-09-00518-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> reveal that most of the samples showed considerable antioxidant potential in the performed assays. 
 <italic>Fc</italic> (41.36 mgTE/g oil) exhibited the most antioxidant activity in ABTS assays, followed by 
 <italic>Fk</italic> (29.12 mgTE/g oil) and 
 <italic>Ft</italic> (28.03 mgTE/g oil). However, in CUPRAC assay, 
 <italic>Fp</italic> (289.45 mgTE/g oil) showed the most superior antioxidant potential followed by 
 <italic>Ft</italic> (278.87 mgTE/g oil) and 
 <italic>Fk</italic> (120.43 mgTE/g oil). Furthermore, 
 <italic>Ft</italic> exhibited the most significant antioxidant power in both FRAP and PM assays with antioxidant activity equivalent to 136.81 mgTE/g oil and 78.66 mmolTE/g oil, respectively, followed by 
 <italic>Fp</italic>, which showed antioxidant potential of 121.64 mgTE/g oil and 50.86 mmolTE/g oil in FRAP and PM assays, respectively. Thus, it can be concluded that the essential oil from both 
 <italic>Ft</italic> and 
 <italic>Fp</italic> exhibited the most notable antioxidant properties as evidenced by their pronounced activities in most of the performed antioxidant assays, followed by 
 <italic>Fc</italic>. α-Pinene, the predominant compound in 
 <italic>Ft</italic> and 
 <italic>Fp</italic> has previously been shown to possess notable antioxidant activity [

Additionally, the significant antioxidant activity found in this study, which can be interpreted as a result of the synergistic action between the different components that exist in the oils, was in accordance with that previously reported for many other 
 <italic>Ferula</italic> species such as 
 <italic>F. microcolea</italic>, 
 <italic>F. orantalis</italic> and 
 <italic>F. communis.</italic> Various mechanisms can be used to interpret antioxidant potential including the prohibition of chain initiation, peroxide decomposition, obstruction of continual hydrogen removal as well as the scavenging of free radical and uniting transition metal ion catalysts [

 <xref rid="B17-antibiotics-09-00518" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Additionally, α-pinene, the main constituent in both 
 <italic>Ft</italic> and 
 <italic>Fp</italic>, has previously been shown to be a potent antioxidant in both DPPH and FRAP assays, displaying EC
 <sub>50</sub> values equal to 310 and 238 μg/mL, respectively [
