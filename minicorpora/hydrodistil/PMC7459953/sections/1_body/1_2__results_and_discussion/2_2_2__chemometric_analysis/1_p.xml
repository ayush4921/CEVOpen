<p>It is extremely difficult to identify the qualitative and quantitative differences between the 
 <italic>Ferula</italic> species under evaluation with the naked eye. So, the data obtained from GC analyses were subjected to unsupervised pattern recognition chemometric analysis utilizing PCA to improve the visualization of these differences. The results of the PCA, as represented by the obtained score plot shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-09-00518-f004">Figure 4</xref>A effectively discriminated the six 
 <italic>Ferula</italic> species into five clusters along the first component (PC1) and the second component (PC2) that account for 57% and 30%, respectively, or 87% of the total variance. From the obtained results, it is obvious that both 
 <italic>Fk</italic> and 
 <italic>Ft</italic> are very closely related to each other as they are gathered together in one cluster in the lower left quadrant. However, PC1 successfully discriminated between 
 <italic>Fk</italic> and 
 <italic>Ft</italic> with negative values of PC1 as they are located in the lower left quadrant and 
 <italic>Fc</italic> and 
 <italic>Fv</italic>, which show positive values of PC1 are located in the lower right quadrant. Meanwhile, PC2 significantly discriminated between 
 <italic>Fk</italic> and 
 <italic>Ft</italic>, which show negative values of PC2 as they are located in the lower left quadrant and between 
 <italic>Fs</italic> and 
 <italic>Fp</italic>, which show positive values of PC2 and are located in the upper left quadrant. Furthermore, both PC1 and PC2 significantly discriminated between 
 <italic>Fc</italic> and 
 <italic>Fv</italic>, which show positive values for PC1 and negative values for PC2 as they are located in the lower right quadrant and between 
 <italic>Fs</italic> and 
 <italic>Fp</italic>, displaying negative values for PC1 and positive values for PC2 as they are located in the upper left quadrant. The major discriminatory signals are Î±-pinene, 10,13-docosadienoic acid methyl ester and palmitic acid as revealed in the loading plot shown in
