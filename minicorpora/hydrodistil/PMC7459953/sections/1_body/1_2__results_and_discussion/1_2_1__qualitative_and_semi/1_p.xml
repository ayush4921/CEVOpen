<p>The differences in the composition of the essential oils obtained from the aerial parts of 
 <italic>Fc</italic>, 
 <italic>Fk</italic>, 
 <italic>Fp</italic>, 
 <italic>Fs</italic>, 
 <italic>Ft</italic> and 
 <italic>Fv</italic> were detected both qualitatively and quantitatively using GC-MS and GC-FID analyses, respectively. All of the essential oils are yellow in color and possess a characteristic odor. Characterization of the essential oils using GC analyses revealed the presence of 106 metabolites (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-09-00518-f002">Figure 2</xref>) that account for 92.10, 96.43, 87.43, 95.95, 92.90 and 89.48% of 
 <italic>Fc</italic>, 
 <italic>Fk</italic>, 
 <italic>Fp</italic>, 
 <italic>Fs</italic>, 
 <italic>Ft</italic> and 
 <italic>Fv</italic> whole essential oils, respectively. Twenty-nine compounds were detected in 
 <italic>Fc</italic> with α-pinene (21.17%), 10,13 docosadienoic acid methyl ester (15.20%), β-caryophyllene oxide (13.23%) and caryophyllene (10.88%) representing the predominant compounds. Meanwhile, thirty-nine compounds were identified in 
 <italic>Fk</italic> essential oil with α-pinene (36.79%) and verbenol (8.49%) being the major compounds. In 
 <italic>Fp</italic>, forty-five compounds were characterized with 4-terpineol (16.28%), α-pinene (10.99%), β-myrcene (6.04%), β-caryophyllene oxide (5.69%), p-cymen-8-ol (5.36%) and spathulenol (5.34%) as the main metabolites in the oil. Furthermore, 15 compounds were determined in 
 <italic>Fs</italic> oil with the main compounds, palmitic acid, β-myrecene, heptacosane, octacosane, hexacosane and pentcosane accounting for 39.09, 10.75, 10.27, 9.60, 8.99 and 6.29%, respectively. For 
 <italic>Ft</italic>, 62 compounds were detected of which α-pinene (42.0%), camphene (8.34%) and α-cadinol (8.14%) exist in high percentages in the oil. Finally, 25 compounds were identified in the 
 <italic>Fv</italic> oil with 10,13 docosadienoic acid methyl ester (69.61%) constituting the major component (

 <xref rid="antibiotics-09-00518-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, it was concluded that monoterpenes are the predominate class of essential oil metabolites in 
 <italic>Fc</italic>, 
 <italic>Fk</italic> and 
 <italic>Ft</italic>, where they represents 24.90, 42.91 and 61.95%, respectively, while oxygenated monoterpenes are the dominant class of metabolites in 
 <italic>Fp</italic> (35.60%), and they also exist in a high percentage in 
 <italic>Fk</italic> (34.82%). On the contrary, fatty acids are highly predominate in 
 <italic>Fs</italic> and 
 <italic>Fv</italic> and account for 82.55 and 79.84%, respectively.
