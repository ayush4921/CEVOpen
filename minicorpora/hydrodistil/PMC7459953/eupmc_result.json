    "The differences in the composition of essential oils obtained from the aerial parts of six <i>Ferula</i> species viz., <i>F. caratavica</i> (<i>Fc</i>), <i>F. kuchistanica</i> (<i>Fk</i>), <i>F. pseudoreoselinum</i> (<i>Fp</i>), <i>F. samarcandica</i> (<i>Fs</i>), <i>F. tenuisecta</i> (<i>Ft</i>) and <i>F. varia</i> (<i>Fv</i>) were detected both qualitatively and semi-quantitatively using GC-MS and GC-FID analyses. One hundred and six metabolites were identified that account for 92.1, 96.43, 87.43, 95.95, 92.90 and 89.48% of <i>Fc</i>, <i>Fk</i>, <i>Fp</i>, <i>Fs</i>, <i>Ft</i> and <i>Fv</i> whole essential oils, respectively. The data from the GC-MS analyses were subjected to unsupervised pattern recognition chemometric analysis utilizing principal component analysis (PCA) to improve the visualization of such differences among the six species. <i>Fk</i> and <i>Ft</i> are very closely related to each other and were gathered together in one cluster. The antioxidant potential was assessed in vitro using different assays including 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS), cupric reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC), ferric reducing power (FRAP) and phosphomolybdenum (PM) assays. <i>Ft</i> and <i>Fp</i> exhibited the most notable antioxidant properties as evidenced by their pronounced activities in most of the antioxidant assays performed, followed by <i>Fc</i>. <i>Fk</i> showed the most effective tyrosinase inhibitory potential, which was estimated as 119.67 mgKAE/g oil, while <i>Fp</i> exhibited the most potent Î±-amylase inhibitory potential, which was equivalent to 2.61 mmol ACAE/g oil. Thus, it was concluded that <i>Ferula</i> species could serve as a promising natural antioxidant drug that could be included in different products and spices to alleviate hyperglycemia and used as a natural ingredient in pharmaceutical cosmetics to counteract hyperpigmentation."
