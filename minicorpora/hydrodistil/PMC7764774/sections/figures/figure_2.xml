  <p>The histologic section of an incisor tooth and periodontal tissue of rats. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Treatment control group, a and b. Intact junctional epithelium with mild inflammatory cells (black head arrows) in the insertion point, c. Regular bone surface with well-formed dense bone, a wide periodontal ligament space of uniform thickness filled with organized proliferating periodontal ligament tissue attached to a regular cementum surface and multiple blood vessels (red arrow, H&amp;E, scale bar 10 μm in section a, and 20 μm in section b and c). (
   <bold>B</bold>) EOK or tested treatment group, a and b. Intact junctional epithelium with mild inflammatory cells (black head arrows) in the insertion point (section b), c. Regular bone surface with well-formed dense bone, and dilated blood vessels (red arrow), d. A wide periodontal ligament space of uniform thickness filled with less organized proliferating periodontal ligament tissue attached to a regular cementum surface (H&amp;E, scale bar 10 μm in section a, and 20 μm in section b–d). (AB; alveolar bone, PL; periodontal ligament and C; cementum).
