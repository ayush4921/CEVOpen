  <p>The histologic section of an incisor tooth and periodontal tissue of rats. (
   <bold>A</bold>) The control negative group, a and b. Normal histological and structural organization of the intact gingival lining epithelium and periodontal tissues (inset is normal histological features in low magnification), (H&amp;E, scale bar 10 μm in section a and b). (
   <bold>B</bold>) Control positive group, a–c. Marked periodontal pocket (P) with disruption of the junctional epithelium and granulation tissue in the insertion point, also above the bone crest that indicated by G and inset, that showed the higher magnification of inflammatory cells infiltration, disorganized bone trabeculae (BT) and irregular bone surface with a presence of osteoclasts involved in bone matrix cavity (black arrows), d. The wide periodontal ligament space is filled with disorganized fiber and proliferating periodontal ligament tissue that has not attached to the cementum, (H&amp;E, scale bar 10 μm in section a, and 20 μm in section b and 40 μm in section c and d). (AB; alveolar bone, PL; periodontal ligament and C; cementum).
