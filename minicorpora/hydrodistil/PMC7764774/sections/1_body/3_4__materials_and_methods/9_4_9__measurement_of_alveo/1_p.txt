0: After scarifying of the rats, the fixed samples were fixed perpendicularly on heavy body impression materials to take a radiograph of them using CBCT (cone bean computed tomography) and a scanner Model-Cat (Imaging Science International) with an exposition area of 6 cm 2 and exposition time of 40 s, and of voxel of 0.2 mm (maximum resolution).
1: The digital images were analyzed using their axial, sagittal, and coronal cuts in the program i-Cat Cone Beam 3D Dental Imaging System, Vesion 3.1.62, Verona, Italy.
2: The horizontal bone loss was determined by measuring the distance the cusp tip and alveolar bone in the long axis of the lower incisor in lingual and mesial side, in units of mm/rat, in a modification method used by Crawford et al.
