 <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> turbidity of (0.8) optical density was determined spectrophotometrically at 600 nm, using (0.03 mL) of a mixture of bacteria and 4% sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (PanReac Química SLU, Barcelona, Spain) with a concentration of (2 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU/mL). Before injecting the animals with
