0: Experimental periodontitis was induced by a combination of ligature and application of  P. gingivalis as follows: after anesthetizing the animals, the necks of the cervix of both mandibular central incisors were ligated with a sterilized black braided nylon thread No 4-0 (Surgilon; USS/DG, Norwalk, CT, USA) sutures.
1: As previously described, this ligature induced gingival irritants and promoted the accumulation of plaque and, subsequently, the development of periodontal disease and, checked daily [ 44], they were subsequently injected with prepared clinically isolated strains of  Porphyromonas gingivalis which were grown in nutrient broth supplemented with 5 g/mL hemin (Sigma Aldrich, Shanghai, China), 1 g/mL vitamin K1 (HiMedia, Mumbai, India), and incubated using an anaerobic jar and anaerobic gas packs (AnearoPack system; Mitsubishi Gas Chemical, Tokyo, Japan) for about 2 days.
