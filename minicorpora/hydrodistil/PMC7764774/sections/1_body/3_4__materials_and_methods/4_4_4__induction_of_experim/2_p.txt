0: P. gingivalis turbidity of (0.8) optical density was determined spectrophotometrically at 600 nm, using (0.03 mL) of a mixture of bacteria and 4% sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (PanReac Quimica SLU, Barcelona, Spain) with a concentration of (2  10 6 CFU/mL).
1: Before injecting the animals with  P. gingivalis, they were anesthetized with a combination of a mixture of ketamine hydrochloride (3.3 mL) and xylazine hydrochloride (2 mL) by intraperitoneal injection at a dose of 0.05 mL/Kg/BW, then  P. gingivalis was locally injected into the gingival sulcus at the bottom of the lower incisor teeth and this procedure was performed three times per week for two weeks [ 45].
