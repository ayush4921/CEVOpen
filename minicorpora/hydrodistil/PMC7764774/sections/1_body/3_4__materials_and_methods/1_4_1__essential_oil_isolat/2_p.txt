0: The chemical composition of essential oil of  P. atlantica was determined by GC-MS method.
1: The sample was run on the Shimadzu QP-2010 GC-MS (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) method with a non-polar columnDB-5 (30 m  0.25 mm  0.25 m) which was linked directly with the MS.
2: The oven temperature was set to 40 C for 2 min and then held isothermally at 280 C for 2 min, while the injector port was held at 280 C. Essential oil (1 L) with hexane (1:1) was injected and the split ratio was 1:5.
3: Data capture took place at 70 eV using 1.5 s scanning times in the 50 to 800 amu mass range.
4: Mass spectra and chromatography were handled with Chem station software Shimadzu GC-MS solution ver.4 software (Tokyo, Japan).
