<p>The individual peaks/constituents were identified by comparison of their Kovats Index (K.I.) either with those of authentic compounds available in the authorâ€™s laboratory or with those of literature in close agreement to K.I. Further identification of essential oil constituents was made by comparison of the fragmentation pattern of mass spectra obtained by GC-MS analysis with those stored in the spectrometer database of NIST, NBS 54 K.L, WILEY8 libraries, and published literature [
