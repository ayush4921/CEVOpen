0: The individual peaks/constituents were identified by comparison of their Kovats Index (K.I.)
1: either with those of authentic compounds available in the authors laboratory or with those of literature in close agreement to K.I.
2: Further identification of essential oil constituents was made by comparison of the fragmentation pattern of mass spectra obtained by GC-MS analysis with those stored in the spectrometer database of NIST, NBS 54 K.L, WILEY8 libraries, and published literature [ 39, 40, 41, 42].
