<p>The chemical composition of essential oil of 
 <italic>P. atlantica</italic> was determined by GC-MS method. The sample was run on the Shimadzu QP-2010 GC-MS (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) method with a non-polar columnDB-5 (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) which was linked directly with the MS. The oven temperature was set to 40 °C for 2 min and then held isothermally at 280 °C for 2 min, while the injector port was held at 280 °C. Essential oil (1 μL) with hexane (1:1) was injected and the split ratio was 1:5. Data capture took place at 70 eV using 1.5 s scanning times in the 50 to 800 amu mass range. Mass spectra and chromatography were handled with Chem station software Shimadzu GC-MS solution ver.4 software (Tokyo, Japan).
