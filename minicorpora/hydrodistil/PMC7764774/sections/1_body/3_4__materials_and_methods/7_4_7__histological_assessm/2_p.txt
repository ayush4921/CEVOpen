0: Inflammatory cells were quantitatively evaluated at the site of damage after inducing periodontitis, whether treated or not treated, in 2 randomly selected fields at 400 by applying a light microscope (Leica Motic, Hong Kong, China), connected with an image analyzer software (AmScope, Tokyo, Japan, 86, 3.7.4183, 2014).
1: For each area, a picture was captured and then partitioned into 16 squares ( Figure 6), then all inflammatory cells (polymorphonuclear cells and mononuclear cells) were counted and an average number for each group was achieved.
2: The inflammatory cells were scored and classified as follows: score 0 (025 inflammatory cells), mild or score 1 (2650 inflammatory cells), score 2 (5175 inflammatory cells), and score 3 (more than 75 inflammatory cells) [ 16].
