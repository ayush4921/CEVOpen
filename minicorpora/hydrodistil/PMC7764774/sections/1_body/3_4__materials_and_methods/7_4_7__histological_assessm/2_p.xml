<p>Inflammatory cells were quantitatively evaluated at the site of damage after inducing periodontitis, whether treated or not treated, in 2 randomly selected fields at 400× by applying a light microscope (Leica Motic, Hong Kong, China), connected with an image analyzer software (AmScope, Tokyo, Japan, 86×, 3.7.4183, 2014). For each area, a picture was captured and then partitioned into 16 squares (

The inflammatory cells were scored and classified as follows: score 0 (0–25 inflammatory cells), mild or score 1 (26–50 inflammatory cells), score 2 (51–75 inflammatory cells), and score 3 (more than 75 inflammatory cells) [
