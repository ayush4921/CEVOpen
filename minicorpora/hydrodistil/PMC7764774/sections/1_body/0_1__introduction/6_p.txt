0: Interleukin-1 (IL-1) stimulates the proliferation of keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells of the periodontal tissues.
1: Additionally, it enhances fibroblast to synthesis type I procollagen, collagenase, hyaluronate, fibronectin, and prostaglandin E 2 [ 17].
2: Therefore, IL-1 is a vital component in the homeostasis of periodontal tissues.
3: Its excessive expression could result in tissue damage [ 18].
4: Interleukin 1 (IL-1) upregulates matrix metalloproteinase and downregulates tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase production.
5: It is well documented that (IL-1) has been involved in the pathogenesis of inflammation induced bone resorption [ 19].
