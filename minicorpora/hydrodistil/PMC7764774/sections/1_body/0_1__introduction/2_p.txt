0: Alveolar bone loss serves as a cardinal pathological and clinical feature for periodontitis.
1: Bone is a dynamic structure that is remodeled continuously.
2: In bone remodeling, there is a balance between bone resorption by osteoclasts and bone formation by osteoblasts.
3: This action is regulated by the effect of receptor activators of nuclear factor-kB ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) [ 5].
4: RANKL is expressed by several cells including osteoblasts, fibroblasts, activated T cells, and B cells, which stimulates the differentiation and maturation of osteoclast precursor cells into active osteoclasts [ 6, 7].
