<p>Alveolar bone loss serves as a cardinal pathological and clinical feature for periodontitis. Bone is a dynamic structure that is remodeled continuously. In bone remodeling, there is a balance between bone resorption by osteoclasts and bone formation by osteoblasts. This action is regulated by the effect of receptor activators of nuclear factor-kB ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) [
