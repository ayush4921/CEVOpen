0: Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the tooth-supporting structure.
1: It causes inflammatory cell infiltration followed by destruction of the connective tissue, cementum, bone, and the formation of periodontal pockets [ 1, 2].
2: The initiation and progression of periodontitis is connected to the presence of bacterial plaque, which enhances a local inflammatory response [ 3].
3: The inflammation causes vasodilatation, edema, infiltration by inflammatory cells and the release of a group of pro-inflammatory cytokines (including IL-1).
4: This process promoted an alveolar bone resorption, which could result in tooth loss [ 4].
