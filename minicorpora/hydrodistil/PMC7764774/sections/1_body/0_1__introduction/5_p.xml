<p>For the first time in the Kurdistan region of Iraq, the antibacterial activity of essential oil of 
 <italic>P. atlantica</italic> gum against a clinically isolated 
 <italic>p. gingivalis</italic> in vitro model has been reported. The polyphenols and flavonoids components of 
 <italic>Pistacia atlantica</italic> kurdica (EOK) are a promising agent in wound healing because of their powerful antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effect [

 <italic>P. atlantica</italic> gum on experimental periodontitis. This study was designed to evaluate whether the extract could control the inflammatory reaction and inhibit alveolar bone resorption in animal models of experimental periodontitis.
