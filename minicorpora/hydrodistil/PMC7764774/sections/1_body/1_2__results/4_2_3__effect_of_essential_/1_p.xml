 <italic>p</italic> = 0.08) in periodontal ligament thickness in the control positive group in comparison to the control negative group (18.90 ± 1.01), with an increase in the occupation of space by inflammatory reaction and tissue damage. In the treatment group the space slightly decreased and there was significant improvement in the thickness of the PDL; for instance, the mean (21.38 ± 1.99) with 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.09 in the treatment control and the EOK treated group showed marked improvement in PDL thickness (21.76 ± 0.87, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.02) in comparison to the control positive group.
