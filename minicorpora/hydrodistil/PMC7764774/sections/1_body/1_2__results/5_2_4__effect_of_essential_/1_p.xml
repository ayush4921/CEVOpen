<p>The mean numbers of osteoclasts in the different groups in this experiment, as displayed in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05819-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05819-f004">Figure 4</xref>, indicate that the number of osteoclasts significantly rose (4.33 ± 0.84, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.004) in the control positive group in comparison to the control negative group. Interestingly, the number of osteoclasts had reduced in both treated groups in comparison to the control positive group; for example, the mean number had dropped significantly in the control treatment group (1.16 ± 0.47, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.4), while in the EOK treated group it decreased with a highly significant effect (1.33 ± 0.42, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.009).
