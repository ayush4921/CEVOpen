 <xref rid="molecules-25-05819-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> presents the mean concentrations of RANKL in the studied groups. As shown, there was a highly significant (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.000) increase in the concentration of RANKL in comparison to the control negative group (514.16 ± 44.35 pg/µL). Meanwhile, there was a highly significant (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.02) reduction in the concentration of the RANKL in the EOK treated (301.66 ± 29.59 pg/µL) group in comparison to the control positive group, and even compared to the treatment control group which recorded (343.33 ± 21.55 pg/µL) with
