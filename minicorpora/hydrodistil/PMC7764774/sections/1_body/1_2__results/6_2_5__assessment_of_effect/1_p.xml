 <xref rid="molecules-25-05819-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> illustrates the evaluation of IL-1β mean concentrations in the different groups. IL-1β levels in the control positive group were significantly higher than in the control negative group and reached 8666.66 ± 299.62 pg/µL by 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.000. Whereas IL-1β concentration decreased significantly in the treatment groups in comparison to the control positive group; in particular, the group treated with 
 <italic>P. atlantica</italic> revealed a significant difference (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.000) and about 117-folds reduction in the IL-1β concentration compared to the treatment control group’s result of 4400.00 ± 288.67 pg/µL with
