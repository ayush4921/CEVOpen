<p>The statistical analysis of the polymorphonuclear and mononuclear inflammatory cells at 30 days among the different groups is shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05819-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The result showed an increase in inflammatory reaction in the control positive group by score 2 in comparison to the control negative group (score 0), which led to severe damage of periodontal tissue. The mean of the polymorphonuclear inflammatory cells was (25.6 ± 5.79), the highest cellular infiltration among these was of neutrophils with high significant value (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.005), followed by eosinophils with significant value (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.02) and non-significant infiltration of basophils (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.18). Meanwhile, the mononuclear inflammatory cells showed highly significant infiltration with mean (33.9 ± 10.38), and increased significance of the plasma and macrophages cells (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.02 and 0.03), in contrast to the treatment control group, where all types of inflammatory cells decreased (score 1); for instance, the mean of the polymorphonuclear inflammatory cells was (18.2 ± 3.88), with the neutrophils having significantly declined (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.004), followed by eosinophils and basophils at 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.16 and 0.13, respectively, while the mononuclear inflammatory cells had fallen significantly to (17.2 ± 4.38), with the plasma and macrophages cells showing a significant effect (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.03 and 0.02). Interestingly, both types of inflammatory cells in the EOK treated group had decreased by score 1, for the polymorphonuclear cells (8.7 ± 1.61), with 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.06 for the neutrophils and a non-significant reduction (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.34 and 0.65) of eosinophils and basophils, respectively. In contrast, the mononuclear inflammatory cells had slightly increased (15.4 ± 21.43), with 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.13 recorded for the plasma cells and 0.39 for the macrophages, which specified a significant effect of the P. atlantica oil in decreasing the inflammatory cells. In comparison to the control treatment group, a significant decrease in inflammatory reaction was seen in the rats treated with EOK (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.02).
