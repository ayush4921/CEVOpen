<p>Active bone resorption was found along with high numbers of osteoclasts involved in a large bone lacuna resorption (Howshipâ€™s lacuna) with ruffled border, marking the irregular bone surface. The newly formed bone trabeculae were disorganized. There was a newly formed layer of osteoid tissue that contained a large number of osteoclast, fibroblast, mononuclear inflammatory cells and dilated blood vessels. The periodontal ligament was partially degenerated and showed disorganized proliferation of periodontal ligament tissue (collagen fibers and fibroblast) that had not attached to the cementum surface.</p>
