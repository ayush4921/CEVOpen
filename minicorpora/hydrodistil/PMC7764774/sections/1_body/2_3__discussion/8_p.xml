<p>Our outcomes indicated that the progression of periodontal disease was more significantly associated with increased levels of RANKL in the control positive group than in the control negative group, possibly leading to marked bone loss and elevation of osteoclast numbers. As demonstrated previously by many studies, RANKL is a positive marker of bone resorption and production of RANKL modulates osteoclastogenesis and bone remodeling. This would explain the bone loss in periodontitis and it indicates that RANKL could play an important role in periodontal bone resorption and its inhibition might decrease resorption of periodontal bone [
