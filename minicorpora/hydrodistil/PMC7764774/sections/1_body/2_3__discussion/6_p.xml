<p>Plasma interleukin analysis in our study illustrated that the amount of IL-1β was much higher in rats’ blood in the control positive group than in healthy rats. Therefore, this group displayed severe destruction of PDL ligaments and connective tissue with marked periodontitis in comparison to the treatment groups; also, our finding is in agreement with authors who demonstrated that aggressive bone destruction correlated with the presence of high levels of proinflammatory IL-1β in periodontal disease [

 <xref rid="B32-molecules-25-05819" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], which is in accordance with our finding that high mean concentration of IL-1β is related to marked bone loss. Additionally, Feghali et al. mentioned that IL-1β stimulates production and extracellular release of high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) from murine fibroblast, Apoptotic and necrotic cell deaths of gingival fibroblasts resulted in the enhancement of HMGB1 [
