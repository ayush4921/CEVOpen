<p>Interestingly, the current study demonstrated that mean concentrations of RANKL were lower in the experimental periodontitis rats treated with the 
 <italic>P. atlantica</italic> gum oil when compared with the control positive group and control treated group. There was also a reduction in alveolar bone loss through a decrease of the osteoclast regulators (RANK) gene. Additionally, our study is in agreement with studies which reported that upregulated RANKL levels are related to the number of
