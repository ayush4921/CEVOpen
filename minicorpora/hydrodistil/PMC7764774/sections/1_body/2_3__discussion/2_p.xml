<p>Our histological findings showed that the extract of essential oil of 
 <italic>P. atlantica</italic> gum improved the damage associated with ligation and 
 <italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic> injection and also decreased loss of alveolar bone, at the same time improving the PDL thickness about 8.67 folds compared to the control positive group that exhibited marked alveolar bone loss and disruption of the periodontal tissues, and marked damage to the PDL of about (30.43 Â± 1.30). Moreover, the 
 <italic>P. atlantica</italic> had a better or the same effect as the chlorhexidine, which is conventionally used for treatment of periodontitis and, according to former reports, is effective in a topical application of 0.2% chlorhexidine gel as a periodontal therapy through the reduction of pellicle formation, modification of bacterial adherence to teeth, and lysis of bacterial cell walls [

 <italic>P. atlantica</italic> oil was due to the presence of antioxidant components such as phenols and flavonoids compounds that are effective in lipid peroxidation reduction and can enhance vascularity, collagen formation (which is the main component of the PDL), and increase cross linking of collagen fibers, as documented by a former study [
