<p>The presence of bacteria at sites of periodontitis may cause a delay in the starting of the proliferative and remodeling stages of wound healing phases due to the releasing of free radicals and lytic enzymes that also cause disruption and damage of the periodontal ligaments and tissues [

The decreasing of the bacterial load in periodontal tissue in the EOK treated group in comparison to the control positive group is due to antibacterial activities of this plant that stimulate healing by acceleration of wound contraction and re-epithelialization of the tissue, and our finding confirms a previous report, which documented that the presence of high concentrations of alpha-pinene in the composition of the oil causes disruption of bacterial cell membrane integrity [
