 <italic>Pistacia atlantica</italic> kurdica gel has shown a significant reduction in gingival inflammation and pocket depth, therefore demonstrating a good anti-inflammatory effect in this study. Here, for the first time, we confirmed a protective effect of 
 <italic>P. atlantica</italic> kurdica gel against bone loss in induced periodontitis by the down regulation of RANKL and IL-1Î² markers through ELISA analysis. However, further studies and with other cytokines are required in order to demonstrate the inhibitory effect of 
 <italic>Pistacia atlantica</italic> on the plasma levels of these cytokines. Hence, this extract can be used as an useful adjunct to enhance the outcomes of standard periodontal therapy.
