<p>An investigation of the antifungal activity of 
 <italic>Rh. tomentosum</italic> EO against 
 <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic> by the agar disc diffusion method revealed that EOs could be potential natural antifungal agents. Mediated amperometry at yeast 
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>-modified electrodes appeared to be fast and effective method to investigate the effect of vapors of 
 <italic>Rh. tomentosum</italic> essential oil on yeast membrane permeability. Yeasts affected by oil vapors possessed three to four-fold higher membrane permeability compared to that of intact yeast cells.
