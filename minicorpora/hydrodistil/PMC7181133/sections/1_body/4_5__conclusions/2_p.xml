<p>The differences in the biological activities of essential oils were ascribed to variation of oils compositions. Toxicity test in vivo using a brine shrimp (
 <italic>Artemia</italic> sp.) bioassay revealed the notable toxic activity of all investigated 
 <italic>Rh. tomentosum</italic> essential oils containing ledol and palustrol as two major compounds. The inflorescence oil comprising a significant amount of myrcene and minor amounts of ascaridol was the least toxic among the investigated samples. Essential oils obtained from young shoots collected in May (third major compound ascaridol and a minor amount of myrcene) were less toxic compared to oils obtained from aged shoots gathered in September and October. The latter oils differed in the quantities of the third major compounds (ascaridol and lepalol). Actually, not only the major constituents of the oils play the principal role in the toxic activity, the impact of less abundant constituents should be considered also.
