<p>It is known that ascaridol is a heat-sensitive compound, which undergoes thermal isomerization and can be converted fully or partially to 
 <italic>iso</italic>-ascaridole during GC analysis. 
 <italic>iso</italic>-Ascaridol (most probably the sum of ascaridol and 
 <italic>iso</italic>-ascaridol or even ascaridol alone) was determined as the third main constituent in shoot oils obtained from marsh rosemary in July, August, and September (5–7 Sh), during pre-seed and seed-ripening stages. The content of 
 <italic>iso</italic>-ascaridol changed drastically (from 0.1 ± 0.1% to 14.0 ± 2.4%) during different vegetative stages. Although only 
 <italic>iso</italic>-ascaridol was determined chromatographically, it is quite possible that actually both isomers 
 <italic>iso</italic>-ascaridol and ascaridol or ascaridol alone exist in the tested oils. Formerly, in order to clarify this phenomenon, a quantitative determination of ascaridol isomers in the 
 <italic>Rh. tomentosum</italic> shoot essential oil was performed by 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectroscopy [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-25-01676" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Spectra were recorded at room temperature, and under these conditions, neither degradation nor thermal isomerization occurred. Higher ascaridol concentration (4.0%) was determined by 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR compared to those (0.6%) determined chromatographically by GC (flame-ionization detector, FID) [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-25-01676" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Ascaridol also has been identified as a predominant compound in the marsh rosemary plants growing in some countries, such as Finland, Sweden, and China [
