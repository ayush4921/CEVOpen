<p>The metabolic pathway of some selected aromadendranes, which are the main components of 
 <italic>R. tomentosum</italic> EOs, has been reported [
 <xref rid="B59-molecules-25-01676" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. It was proposed that the biosynthesis of ledol takes place directly from 
 <italic>allo</italic>-aromadendrene or through 
 <italic>allo</italic>-aromadendrene epoxide. Possibly, the 
 <italic>allo</italic>-aromadendrene is also a precursor of palustrol; the pathway proceeds through ledene oxide (II) [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-25-01676" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. On other hand, it was suggested that (+)-bicyclogermacrene could be a potential platform intermediate for several aromadendrane sesquiterpenoids, such as ledene, viridiflorol, palustrol, and spathulenol [
 <xref rid="B60-molecules-25-01676" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Obviously, there could be several possible biosynthesis pathways of ledol and palustrol in the plants. On the basis of the minor amounts of 
 <italic>allo</italic>-aromadendrene determined in our research and the absence of bicyclogermacrene, we can hypothesize that the ledol and palustrol biosynthetic pathway arises from 
 <italic>allo</italic>-aromadendrene. α-Terpinene is a precursor of ascaridol [
 <xref rid="B61-molecules-25-01676" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]; the synthesis of the latter compound takes place in presence of oxygen and light. It is known that the laboratory synthesis of monoterpenoid ascaridol is performed from α-terpinene as well.
