<p>The abilities of plant extracts or separate compounds to scavenge ABTS cation radicals and DPPH radicals are frequently used to evaluate antioxidant activity. Young shoot essential oil (4 Sh, June) were the most active (48.19 ± 0.1 mmol/L TROLOX sample). The older the plant, the lower the ability of its second metabolite to scavenge ABTS
 <sup>•</sup>
 <sup>+</sup>, i.e., 30.35 ± 0.03 and 16.25 ± 0.2 mmol/L for shoot oils (
 <bold>7</bold> Sh and 8 Sh) of plants collected in September and October, respectively. A similar tendency was observed in DPPH
 <sup>•</sup> assay. Values of the TROLOX equivalent ranged from 5.86 ± 0.07 in flower oils to 19.89 ± 0.3 in shoot oils collected in June. Young shoot essential oil (4 Sh, June) were the most active in DPPH
 <sup>•</sup> assay as well.
