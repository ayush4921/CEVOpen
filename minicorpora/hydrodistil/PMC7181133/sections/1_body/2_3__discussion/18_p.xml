<p>Without EO treatment, the current responses to 0.2 mmol/L 
 <italic>L</italic>-lactic acid at the yeast-modified electrode were obviously lower (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-01676-f003">Figure 3</xref>, short-dashed line) compared to those obtained when yeast-modified electrodes were subjected to vapors of EO (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-01676-f003">Figure 3</xref>, long-dashed and solid lines). The decrease of the current response during measurement (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-01676-f003">Figure 3</xref>, solid line) possibly could indicate that a longer time (40 min) of subjection to vapors has affected the enzyme as well. The effect of 
 <italic>Rh. tomentosum</italic> EO vapors on yeast was observed already in 10 min and increased with time (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-01676-f004">Figure 4</xref>). A maximal effect was observed after about 20 min and practically did not change during the tested time (up to 40 min). This was a relatively short time needed to observe the effect of volatile compounds on yeast membrane permeability. For comparison, yeast-modified electrode subjection to the vapors of 
 <italic>Juniperus communis</italic> L. EOs for up to 40 min practically had no effect on electrode responses to lactic acid. The fast effect of vapors of 
 <italic>Rh. tomentosum</italic> essential oil on yeasts could be the possible reason why inhibition tests on agar were not successful. The research of the effects of various EOs on yeast membrane permeability is in progress. Dynamics of yeast-electrode responses to lactic acid could serve as a measure of EO antifungal activity. The shortcoming of the proposed amperometric method is that it can be applied for unicellular yeasts possessing relatively easily inducible changes in membrane permeability.
