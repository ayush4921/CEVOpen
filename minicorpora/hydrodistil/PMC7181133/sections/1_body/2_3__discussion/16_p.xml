<p>Among several mechanisms responsible for the antifungal activity of EOs [
 <xref rid="B68-molecules-25-01676" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], the disruption of cell membranes is frequently determined. The yeast cell envelope consists of a plasma membrane and cell wall [
 <xref rid="B69-molecules-25-01676" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. A relatively thick cell wall composed mostly from polysaccharides, chitin, and proteins is responsible for the cell’s resistance to mechanical stress and presents no real barrier to the diffusion to small molecules and ions. The plasma membrane forms a relatively impermeable barrier for hydrophilic molecules. Membrane permeability can be increased by cell treatment with solvents, detergents, salts, cell freezing and thawing [
 <xref rid="B70-molecules-25-01676" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], or by electropermeabilization [
 <xref rid="B71-molecules-25-01676" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Recently, the effect of essential oil of 
 <italic>Mentha piperita</italic> L. on various yeasts through the perturbation of different physiological functions (including membrane permeability) was reported [
 <xref rid="B72-molecules-25-01676" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. As an alternative to the sophisticated flow cytometry presented in the latter publication, we have used a mediated amperometry to evaluate the permeability of yeast membrane. An amperometric approach to investigate the permeability of yeast membrane is based on the 
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>-modified electrode responses to L-lactic acid [
 <xref rid="B73-molecules-25-01676" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] according to the scheme:
 <disp-formula>
  <italic>L</italic>-lactic acid + flavocytochrome b
  <sub>2(ox)</sub> →pyruvic acid + flavocytochrome b
  <sub>2(red)</sub>
  <label>(1)</label>
 </disp-formula>
 <disp-formula>flavocytochrome b
  <sub>2(red)</sub> + mediator
  <sub>(ox)</sub>→flavocytochrome b
  <sub>2(ox)</sub> + mediator
  <sub>(red)</sub>
  <label>(2)</label>
 </disp-formula>
 <disp-formula>mediator
  <sub>(red)</sub>→mediator
  <sub>(ox)</sub> + e
  <sup>−</sup>
  <label>(3)</label>
 </disp-formula> where Equations (1) and (2) are chemical reactions of flavocytochrome b
 <sub>2</sub> with the lactic acid and mediator, respectively, and Equation (3) is the electrochemical oxidation of the reduced form of mediator (schematic image is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-01676-f002">Figure 2</xref>).
