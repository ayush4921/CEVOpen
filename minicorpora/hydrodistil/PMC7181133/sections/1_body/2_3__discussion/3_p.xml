<p>Totally, up to 70 constituents were identified in the 
 <italic>Rh. tomentosum</italic> EOs; they comprised from 91.0 ± 4.7% to 96.2 ± 3.1% of total oil content. Oxygenated sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (54.1 ± 1.5%–76.1 ± 4.5%) were found to be the main fraction. A detailed chemical composition of the EOs of marsh rosemary (collected in 2007) from Samanis forest marsh was presented in the previous work [
