<p>The antifungal activity of 
 <italic>Rh. tomentosum</italic> essential oil (8 Sh, one of the most toxic) was tested against 
 <italic>C. parapsilosis.</italic> Infections caused by 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> and non-
 <italic>albicans Candida</italic> species remain one of the most common types of fungal infections. A previous investigation of the antifungal/antimicrobial activities of

 <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic> is of particular importance, as it is able to form tenacious biofilms on central venous catheters and other implanted devices, thus threatening patients who have undergone medical interventions [
