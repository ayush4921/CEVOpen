<p>The yields of 
 <italic>Rh. tomentosum</italic> EOs varied significantly (almost three-fold) depending on the plant vegetation stage. During plant growing, the yields were the lowest 0.59% (
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic>) in April, and increased to maximum values of 1.73% and 1.76% (
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic>) in June and July (at the end of flowering), respectively. Thereafter, the yields decreased to 1.36% (
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic>) in October, at full seeding stage. The differences in the content of EOs could be explained by temperature and sun illumination intensity as well.
