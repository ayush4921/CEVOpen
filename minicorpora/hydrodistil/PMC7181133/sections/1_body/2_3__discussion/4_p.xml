<p>All the oils were characterized by major compounds of aromadendrane skeleton, ledol, and palustrol. The largest quantities of these two principal compounds were determined in the beginning (in April and May) and at the end of vegetation (October), while the lowest amount of them was detected in June, at the beginning of seed formation (
