<p>Furyl-containing compounds such as lepaline, lepalone, lepalol, and 2-methyl-5-(3-furyl)-3-penten-2-ol were present in all the studied oils (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-01676-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The quantities of these furyl monoterpenoids increased in the autumn months. An appreciable amount (7.9 ± 0.3%) of lepalol was determined in shoot oil (8 Sh) obtained from marsh rosemary gathered in October. Lepalol in a quantity of 3.3 ± 0.3% was found as the third major constituent in the shoot oil (1 Sh) in April.
