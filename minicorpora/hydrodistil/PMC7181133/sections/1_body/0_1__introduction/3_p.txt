0: Rh.
1: tomentosum plants synthesize a high content of terpenoids in glandular trichomes and emit a strong characteristic smell, which attracts bees and other pollinating insects.
2: The smell may cause headaches to some people.
3: The chemical compositions of the essential oils (EOs) of the entire plant or separated aerial parts (mostly shoots) of  Rh.
4: tomentosum have been studied in some European countries [ 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19], the Far East and Siberia [ 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25], and Asian countries [ 17, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37].
5: A lot research works have been focused on the evaluation of bioactivities of marsh rosemary extracts.
6: It was shown that  Rh.
7: tomentosum extracts, essential oils, or emitted volatiles influence herbivores behavior [ 9, 10, 38, 39, 40] and the growth of neighboring plants [ 24], have an impact on polypropylene plastic degradation [ 31], and possess analgesic [ 41], antibacterial [ 42], anticancer [ 43, 44], antidiabetic [ 45, 46], antifungal [ 47, 48], anti-inflammatory [ 41, 42, 49, 50, 51], antioxidant [ 33, 46], antimicrobial [ 33, 52], anti-proliferative, and pro-apoptotic [ 19], antithrombin [ 43], hepatoprotective [ 53], toxic [ 54], and radioprotective [ 55, 56] properties (see  Supplementary materials: Table S1 for details).
