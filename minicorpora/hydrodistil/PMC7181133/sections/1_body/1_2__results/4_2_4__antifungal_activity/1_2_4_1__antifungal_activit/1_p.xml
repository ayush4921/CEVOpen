<p>The antifungal activity of essential oils against microorganisms is often assayed by the agar disc diffusion method [
 <xref rid="B58-molecules-25-01676" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The diameters of the inhibition zones formed on agar layers with inoculated tested cultures reflect the capabilities of EOs to affect their growth: the larger the inhibition zone that is obtained, the more effective the antimicrobial activity that is ascribed to the EO. Agar plates were inoculated with Candida parapsilosis. Then, the filter paper discs (6 mm in diameter) impregnated with 10 ÂµL of diluted EO (8 Sh) and nystatin (an agent used to treat Candida infections) as a positive control were placed on the agar surfaces.
