<p>Instead of agar disc assay, mediated amperometry was used as an alternative. The effect of the essential oil on the yeast membrane permeability was monitored by measuring potassium ferricyanide-mediated current responses to lactic acid at yeast-modified electrodes treated with vapors of EO (a schematic image of amperometric measurements is presented in
