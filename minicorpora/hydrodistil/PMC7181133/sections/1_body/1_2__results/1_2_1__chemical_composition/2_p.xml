<p>The plant material was collected from April (at the shoot-growing stage) to October (seed full-ripening phase). Palustrol (24.6 ± 2.6–33.5 ± 4.4% in all oil samples), ledol (18.0 ± 2.9–29.0 ± 5.0% in all samples), ascaridol isomers (7.0 ± 2.4–14.0 ± 2.4% in three oils), myrcene (7.2 ± 0.3 and 10.1 ± 1.3%), lepalol (3.3 ± 0.3 and 7.9 ± 3.0%), and cyclocolorenone isomers (4.1 ± 2.5%) were determined among the three major constituents in the oils. Palustrol and ledol was the first or second dominant compound in all the oils, and the total average quantity of these two sesquiterpene alcohols comprised on average 42.6–62.5% of all the oil content. The third position was attributed to the rest of the compounds listed above. 
 <italic>iso</italic>-Ascaridol (most probably the sum of ascaridol and 
 <italic>iso</italic>-ascaridol or even ascaridol alone) was the third main constituent in shoot oils obtained from marsh rosemary in July, August, and September (5–7 Sh), while an average content of this compound varied from 0.1% to 5.3% in the rest of the samples. Monoterpene hydrocarbon myrcene occupied the third position in inflorescence (3 Fl May) and shoot (4 Sh June) oils (10.1 ± 1.3 and 7.2 ± 0.3%, respectively). One shoot oil (8 Sh) collected during the seeding stage in October was characterized by an appreciable amount (7.9 ± 0.3%) of heteroaromatic compound lepalol, while an average quantity of this constituent varied from 0.1% to 3.3% in the rest of the samples. Two cyclocolorenone isomers (4.1 ± 2.5%) occupied the third position in the shoot oil (2 Sh) of plants gathered during the flowering stage (
