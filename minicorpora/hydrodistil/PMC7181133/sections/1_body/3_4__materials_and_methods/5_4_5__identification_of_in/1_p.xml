<p>The percentage composition of the essential oils was computed from GC peak areas without correction factors. Qualitative analysis was based on comparison of retention indexes on both columns, co-injection of some reference terpenoids (α-, β-pinenes, sabinene, myrcene,

 <xref rid="B57-molecules-25-01676" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] and computer mass spectra libraries (Wiley and NBS 54K). Identification has been approved when computer matching with the mass spectral libraries was with probabilities above 90%.
