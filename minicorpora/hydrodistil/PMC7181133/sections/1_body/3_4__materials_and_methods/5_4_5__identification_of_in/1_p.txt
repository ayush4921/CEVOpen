0: The percentage composition of the essential oils was computed from GC peak areas without correction factors.
1: Qualitative analysis was based on comparison of retention indexes on both columns, co-injection of some reference terpenoids (-, -pinenes, sabinene, myrcene,  p-cymene, -terpinene, thymol, neryl + geranyl acetate, -caryophyllene, -humulene, caryophyllene oxide) and C 8-C 28 n-alkane series; and mass spectra with corresponding data in the literature [ 57] and computer mass spectra libraries (Wiley and NBS 54K).
2: Identification has been approved when computer matching with the mass spectral libraries was with probabilities above 90%.
