0: Pathogenic yeast  Candida parapsilosis CBS 883C was from the collection of the Laboratory of Biodeterioration Research, Nature Research Centre (Vilnius, Lithuania).
1: Bakers yeast  S. cerevisiae was obtained from a local market (shelf life not less than 2 weeks as specified by the producer).
2: The antifungal activity of  Rh.
3: tomentosum was tested by the agar disc diffusion assay.
4: The tests were carried out employing 100 L of suspension containing 10 6 CFU (colony-forming units)/mL of yeast spread on MuellerHinton agar (Liofilchem, Roseto, Italy) on a Petri plate (90 mm).
5: Inoculum was obtained from yeasts cultured in Sabouraud dextrose agar (Liofilchem, Roseto, Italy) at 28  1 C for 48 h. After the absorption of inoculum by agar, the sterile paper discs (6 mm in diameter) impregnated with 10 L of methanolic solution (10 mg/mL) of  Rh.
6: tomentosum EO (8 Sh, October) was placed on the surface of agar layer.
7: The inoculated Petri plates were incubated at 30 C for 48 h. Nystatin (100 I.U., Liofilchem, Roseto, Italy) was used as a positive control.
8: The diameters of transparent inhibition zones formed in the yeast lawns around impregnated paper discs were used as a measure of antifungal activity.
9: Each assay was repeated twice.
