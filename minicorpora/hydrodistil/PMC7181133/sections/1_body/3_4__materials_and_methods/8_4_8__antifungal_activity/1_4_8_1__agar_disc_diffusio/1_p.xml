<p>Pathogenic yeast 
 <italic>Candida parapsilosis</italic> CBS 883C was from the collection of the Laboratory of Biodeterioration Research, Nature Research Centre (Vilnius, Lithuania). Baker’s yeast 
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> was obtained from a local market (shelf life not less than 2 weeks as specified by the producer). The antifungal activity of 
 <italic>Rh. tomentosum</italic> was tested by the agar disc diffusion assay. The tests were carried out employing 100 μL of suspension containing 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU (colony-forming units)/mL of yeast spread on Mueller–Hinton agar (Liofilchem, Roseto, Italy) on a Petri plate (90 mm). Inoculum was obtained from yeasts cultured in Sabouraud dextrose agar (Liofilchem, Roseto, Italy) at 28 ± 1 °C for 48 h. After the absorption of inoculum by agar, the sterile paper discs (6 mm in diameter) impregnated with 10 µL of methanolic solution (10 mg/mL) of 
 <italic>Rh. tomentosum</italic> EO (8 Sh, October) was placed on the surface of agar layer. The inoculated Petri plates were incubated at 30 °C for 48 h. Nystatin (100 I.U., Liofilchem, Roseto, Italy) was used as a positive control. The diameters of transparent inhibition zones formed in the yeast lawns around impregnated paper discs were used as a measure of antifungal activity. Each assay was repeated twice.
