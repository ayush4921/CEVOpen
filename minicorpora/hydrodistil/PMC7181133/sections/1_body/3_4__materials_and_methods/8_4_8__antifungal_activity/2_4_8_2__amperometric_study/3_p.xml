<p>Electrochemical experiments were carried out with a BAS-Epsilon Bioanalytical system (West Lafayette, IN, USA), and a three-electrode cell arranged with a magnetic stirrer. A modified carbon paste electrode served as a working electrode. Platinum wire and Ag/AgCl, 3N NaCl were, respectively, counter- and reference electrodes. Amperometric measurements were performed in a stirred phosphate buffer at pH 7.3 containing 0.5 mmol/L of K
 <sub>3</sub>[Fe(CN)
 <sub>6</sub>]. The yeast-modified electrode was held at a constant potential until a steady state of the background current was achieved. Electrode responses to lactic acid were measured after the addition of L-lactic acid to a final concentration of 0.2 mmol/L. All experiments were carried out at room temperature.
