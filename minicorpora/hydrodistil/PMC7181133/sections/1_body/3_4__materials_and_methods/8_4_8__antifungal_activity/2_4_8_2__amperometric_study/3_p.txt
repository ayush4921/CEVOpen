0: Electrochemical experiments were carried out with a BAS-Epsilon Bioanalytical system (West Lafayette, IN, USA), and a three-electrode cell arranged with a magnetic stirrer.
1: A modified carbon paste electrode served as a working electrode.
2: Platinum wire and Ag/AgCl, 3N NaCl were, respectively, counter- and reference electrodes.
3: Amperometric measurements were performed in a stirred phosphate buffer at pH 7.3 containing 0.5 mmol/L of K 3[Fe(CN) 6].
4: The yeast-modified electrode was held at a constant potential until a steady state of the background current was achieved.
5: Electrode responses to lactic acid were measured after the addition of L-lactic acid to a final concentration of 0.2 mmol/L.
6: All experiments were carried out at room temperature.
