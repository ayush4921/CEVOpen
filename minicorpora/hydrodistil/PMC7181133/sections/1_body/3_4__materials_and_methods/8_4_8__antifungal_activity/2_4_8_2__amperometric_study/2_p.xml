<p>Plain carbon paste was prepared by mixing 100 mg of graphite powder (Merck) with 50 µL of paraffin oil (Fluka). The paste was packed into an electrode body consisting of a plastic tube (diameter 2.9 mm) and a copper wire serving as an electrode contact. Yeast-modified electrodes were prepared by placing 10 µL of yeast suspension containing 40 mg of yeast and 0.5 mL water. The electrodes were allowed to dry at room temperature. The yeast-modified electrodes were transferred into custom-made camera (30 mL) containing a small amount of 
 <italic>Rh. tomentosum</italic> EO (8 Sh, October) and subjected to the vapors of the oil for 5, 10, 20, 30 or 40 min. Thereafter, the electrodes were covered with a dialysis membrane (Aldrich-Sigma) presoaked in water. Yeast-modified electrodes without vapor pretreatment were used for comparison. The experiments were performed in triplicate.
