0: Plain carbon paste was prepared by mixing 100 mg of graphite powder (Merck) with 50 L of paraffin oil (Fluka).
1: The paste was packed into an electrode body consisting of a plastic tube (diameter 2.9 mm) and a copper wire serving as an electrode contact.
2: Yeast-modified electrodes were prepared by placing 10 L of yeast suspension containing 40 mg of yeast and 0.5 mL water.
3: The electrodes were allowed to dry at room temperature.
4: The yeast-modified electrodes were transferred into custom-made camera (30 mL) containing a small amount of  Rh.
5: tomentosum EO (8 Sh, October) and subjected to the vapors of the oil for 5, 10, 20, 30 or 40 min.
6: Thereafter, the electrodes were covered with a dialysis membrane (Aldrich-Sigma) presoaked in water.
7: Yeast-modified electrodes without vapor pretreatment were used for comparison.
8: The experiments were performed in triplicate.
