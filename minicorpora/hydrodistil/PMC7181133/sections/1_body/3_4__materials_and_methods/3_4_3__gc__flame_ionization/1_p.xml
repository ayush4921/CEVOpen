<p>Quantitative analyses of the essential oils were carried out by GC on DB-5 ((5%-phenyl)-methylpolisiloxane; 50 m × 0.32 mm × 0.25 μm) and HP-FFAP (polyethylene glycol 30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., film thickness 0.25 μm) capillary columns using an HP 5890II chromatograph equipped with a FID. The GC oven temperature was programmed as follows: from 60 °C (isothermal for 3 min) increased to 160 °C (isothermal for 2 min) at a rate of 5 °C/min, then increased to 250 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min, and the final temperature was kept for 3 min. The temperature of the injector and detector was maintained at 250 °C. The flow rate of carrier gas (hydrogen) was 1 mL/min. At least two repetitions (
 <italic>n</italic> ≥ 2) per analysis were performed. Injection volume was 2 µL. Retention indices were determined relative to the retention times of a series of n-alkanes. The relative proportions of the oil constituents were expressed as percentages obtained by peak area normalization, all relative response factors being taken as one.
