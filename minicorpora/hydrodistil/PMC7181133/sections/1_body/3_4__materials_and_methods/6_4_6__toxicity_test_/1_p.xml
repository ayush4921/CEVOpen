<p>The toxicity of eight samples of 
 <italic>Rh. tomentosum</italic> inflorescence and shoot essential oils was tested in vivo, using brine shrimp 
 <italic>Artemia</italic> sp. (larvae) [
 <xref rid="B74-molecules-25-01676" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. The eggs of shrimps hatch in sea water (31 g/L sea salt) at 20–25 °C within 48 h to provide larvae (nauplii). Thereafter, different concentrations of marsh rosemary essential oils dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were added, and survivors were counted after 24 h. Lethality (LC
 <sub>50</sub> and LC
 <sub>95</sub>) of nauplii was calculated (
 <italic>n</italic> ≥ 4, with 95% confidence interval). Control tests were performed both with salt water and salt water with DMSO (5–40 µL).
