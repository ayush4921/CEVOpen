0: The toxicity of eight samples of  Rh.
1: tomentosum inflorescence and shoot essential oils was tested in vivo, using brine shrimp  Artemia sp.
2: (larvae) [ 74].
3: The eggs of shrimps hatch in sea water (31 g/L sea salt) at 2025 C within 48 h to provide larvae (nauplii).
4: Thereafter, different concentrations of marsh rosemary essential oils dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were added, and survivors were counted after 24 h. Lethality (LC 50 and LC 95) of nauplii was calculated ( n  4, with 95% confidence interval).
5: Control tests were performed both with salt water and salt water with DMSO (540 L).
