0: Analyses were carried out using an HP 5890 gas chromatograph equipped with an HP 5971 mass selective detector and an HP 7673 split/splitless (splitless 0.75 min) injector on the same capillary column DB-5.
1: The conditions of chromatographic separation were the same as for GC (FID) analysis.
2: The temperature of the injector and detector was 250 C. The flow rate of carrier gas (helium) was 1 mL/min.
3: At least two repetitions ( n  2) per analysis were performed.
4: Injection volume 2 L. Mass spectra in electron mode were generated at 70 eV, 0.97 scans/second, mass range 35650 m/z.
