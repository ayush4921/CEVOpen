<p>Analyses were carried out using an HP 5890 gas chromatograph equipped with an HP 5971 mass selective detector and an HP 7673 split/splitless (splitless 0.75 min) injector on the same capillary column DB-5. The conditions of chromatographic separation were the same as for GC (FID) analysis. The temperature of the injector and detector was 250 °C. The flow rate of carrier gas (helium) was 1 mL/min. At least two repetitions (
 <italic>n</italic> ≥ 2) per analysis were performed. Injection volume 2 µL. Mass spectra in electron mode were generated at 70 eV, 0.97 scans/second, mass range 35–650 m/z.
