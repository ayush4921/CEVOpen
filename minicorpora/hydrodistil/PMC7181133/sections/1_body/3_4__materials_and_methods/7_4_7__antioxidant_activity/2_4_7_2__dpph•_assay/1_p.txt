0: A 6  10 5 M stock solution of DPPH  was obtained by dissolving 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl with methanol.
1: The working solution was prepared by diluting stock solution with methanol to obtain an absorbance value of 0.730  0.02 at 515 nm.
2: Essential oils for analysis were diluted 1:200 with a mixture of methanol and water (80:20); 0.1 mL of the prepared sample was allowed to react with 3.9 mL of working DPPH  solution for 30 min in the dark.
3: Thereafter, the absorbance of reacted mixture was measured at 515 nm.
4: Results are expressed in mmol/L TROLOX equivalents.
5: All measurements were done in triplicate.
