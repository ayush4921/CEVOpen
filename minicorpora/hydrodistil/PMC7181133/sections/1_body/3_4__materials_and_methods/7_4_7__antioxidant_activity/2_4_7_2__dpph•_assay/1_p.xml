<p>A 6 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup> M stock solution of DPPH
 <sup>•</sup> was obtained by dissolving 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl with methanol. The working solution was prepared by diluting stock solution with methanol to obtain an absorbance value of 0.730 ± 0.02 at 515 nm. Essential oils for analysis were diluted 1:200 with a mixture of methanol and water (80:20); 0.1 mL of the prepared sample was allowed to react with 3.9 mL of working DPPH
 <sup>•</sup> solution for 30 min in the dark. Thereafter, the absorbance of reacted mixture was measured at 515 nm. Results are expressed in mmol/L TROLOX equivalents. All measurements were done in triplicate.
