0: The stock solution containing ABTS + (2,2-azino-bis(ethylbenzotiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt) and potassium persulfate (K 2S 2O 8) was prepared, dissolving these materials in a mixture of methanol and water (80:20) and left for 12 h in the darkness.
1: The working solution was prepared by diluting stock solution with a mixture of methanol and water (80:20) to obtain an absorbance value of 0.730  0.02 at 734 nm.
2: The absorbance was measured using the spectrophotometer (UV/Vis Lambda 25, Perkin Elmer Inc., Hamburg, Germany).
3: Essential oils for analysis were diluted 1:50 with a mixture of methanol and water (80:20); 0.1 mL of prepared sample was allowed to react with 3.9 mL of working ABTS + solution for 15 min in the dark.
4: Thereafter, the absorbance of reacted mixture was measured.
5: The results are expressed in mmol/L TROLOX equivalents.
6: All measurements were done in triplicate.
