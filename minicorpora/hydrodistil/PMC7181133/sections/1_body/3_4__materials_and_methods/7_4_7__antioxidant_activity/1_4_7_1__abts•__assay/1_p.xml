 <sub>8</sub>) was prepared, dissolving these materials in a mixture of methanol and water (80:20) and left for 12 h in the darkness. The working solution was prepared by diluting stock solution with a mixture of methanol and water (80:20) to obtain an absorbance value of 0.730 ± 0.02 at 734 nm. The absorbance was measured using the spectrophotometer (UV/Vis Lambda 25, Perkin Elmer Inc., Hamburg, Germany). Essential oils for analysis were diluted 1:50 with a mixture of methanol and water (80:20); 0.1 mL of prepared sample was allowed to react with 3.9 mL of working ABTS
 <sup>•</sup>
 <sup>+</sup> solution for 15 min in the dark. Thereafter, the absorbance of reacted mixture was measured. The results are expressed in mmol/L TROLOX equivalents. All measurements were done in triplicate.
