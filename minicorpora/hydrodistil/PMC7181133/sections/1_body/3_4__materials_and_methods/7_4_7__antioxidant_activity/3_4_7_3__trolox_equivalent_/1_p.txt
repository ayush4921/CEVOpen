0: First, 5 mg of Trolox (()-6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetra-methylchromane-2-carboxylic acid) was dissolved in a mixture of methanol and water (70:30) and diluted to 100 mL.
1: To obtain standard calibration curves, the solutions of four concentrations (200, 100, 50, and 25 mmol/L) of Trolox were prepared.
2: Then, 0.1 mL of each Trolox solution was allowed to react with 3.9 mL of working solutions of ABTS + and DPPH .
3: Absorbance values were measured after 15 and 30 min at 734 and 515 nm, respectively.
4: Linear calibration curves (see  Figure S2) were obtained and their parameters were used for further calculations of antioxidant activity.
5: All measurements were done in triplicate.
