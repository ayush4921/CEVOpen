<p>First, 5 mg of Trolox ((±)-6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetra-methylchromane-2-carboxylic acid) was dissolved in a mixture of methanol and water (70:30) and diluted to 100 mL. To obtain standard calibration curves, the solutions of four concentrations (200, 100, 50, and 25 mmol/L) of Trolox were prepared. Then, 0.1 mL of each Trolox solution was allowed to react with 3.9 mL of working solutions of ABTS
 <sup>•</sup>
 <sup>+</sup> and DPPH
 <sup>•</sup>. Absorbance values were measured after 15 and 30 min at 734 and 515 nm, respectively. Linear calibration curves (see 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-01676">Figure S2</xref>) were obtained and their parameters were used for further calculations of antioxidant activity. All measurements were done in triplicate.
