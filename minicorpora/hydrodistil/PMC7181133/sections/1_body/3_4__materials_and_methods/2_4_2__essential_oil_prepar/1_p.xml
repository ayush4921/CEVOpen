<p>The essential oils were extracted from air-dried material (50g each) by hydrodistillation for 2 h in a Clevenger-type apparatus according to the 
 <italic>European Pharmacopoeia</italic>. The ratio of plant material to water was 1:20. A yellow-gray, greasy mass with a sweet characteristic odor was obtained. The yields of the oils ranged from 0.59% to 1.76% (

 <italic>w</italic>, on a dry weight basis). The obtained oils were dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, kept in closed dark vials and stored in a refrigerator at −18 °C. In order to obtain appropriate chromatograms, the pure oil samples were diluted dozens of times with a mixture of pentane and diethyl ether (1:1) just before analyses.
