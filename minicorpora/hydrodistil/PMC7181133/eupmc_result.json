    "The chemical composition of eight (seven shoot and one inflorescence) essential oils (EOs) of <i>Rh. tomentosum</i> H. plants growing in Eastern Lithuania is reported. The plant material was collected during different phases of vegetation (from April to October). The oils were obtained by hydrodistillation from air-dried aerial parts (leaves and inflorescences). In total, up to 70 compounds were identified by GC-MS and GC (flame-ionization detector, FID); they comprised 91.0 ± 4.7%-96.2 ± 3.1% of the oil content. Sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (54.1 ± 1.5%-76.1 ± 4.5%) were found to be the main fraction. The major compounds were palustrol (24.6 ± 2.6%-33.5 ± 4.4%) and ledol (18.0 ± 2.9%-29.0 ± 5.0%). Ascaridol isomers (7.0 ± 2.4%-14.0 ± 2.4% in three oils), myrcene (7.2 ± 0.3% and 10.1 ± 1.3%), lepalol (3.3 ± 0.3% and 7.9 ± 3.0%), and cyclocolorenone isomers (4.1 ± 2.5%) were determined as the third main constituents. The toxic activity of marsh rosemary inflorescence and shoot oils samples was evaluated using a brine shrimp (<i>Artemia</i> sp.) bioassay. LC<sub>50</sub> average values (11.23-20.50 µg/mL) obtained after 24 h of exposure revealed that the oils were notably toxic. The oil obtained from shoots gathered in September during the seed-ripening stage and containing appreciable amounts of palustrol (26.0 ± 2.5%), ledol (21.5 ± 4.0%), and ascaridol (7.0 ± 2.4%) showed the highest toxic activity. Radical scavenging activity of <i>Rh. tomentosum</i> EOs depended on the plant vegetation stage. The highest activities were obtained for EOs isolated from young shoots collected in June (48.19 ± 0.1 and 19.89 ± 0.3 mmol/L TROLOX (6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetra-methylchromane-2-carboxylic acid) equivalent obtained by, respectively, ABTS<sup>•</sup><sup>+</sup> (2,2'-amino-bis(ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt) and DPPH<sup>•</sup>(2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) assays). Agar disc diffusion assay against pathogenic yeast <i>Candida parapsilosis</i> revealed the potential antifungal activity of EOs. An alternative investigation of antifungal activity employed mediated amperometry at yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>-modified electrodes. The subjection of yeast cells to vapors of EO resulted in a three to four-fold increase of electrode responses due to the disruption of yeast cell membranes."
