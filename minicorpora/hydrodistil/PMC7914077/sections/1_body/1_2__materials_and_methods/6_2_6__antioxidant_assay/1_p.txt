0: The determination of antioxidant activity was carried out according to the methodology suggested by Re et al., with modifications [ 15].
1: The test was carried out with a radical of ABTS which was prepared by the reaction of 5.0 mL of a 3.840  g/mL solution of ABTS with 88  L of the 37.840  g/mL potassium persulfate solution.
2: The mixture was left in the dark at room temperature for 16 hours.
3: Immediately after mixing, it was diluted in ethanol until an absorbance of 0.7 at 734 nm was obtained.
4: In a dark environment, an aliquot of 30  L of each concentration of essential oil (200 to 15  g/mL) and eugenol (90 to 5  g/mL) was transferred in test tubes containing 3.0 mL of the radical cation ABTS and homogenized in a tube shaker, and after 6 minutes the absorbance of the reaction mixture was read on a spectrophotometer at a length of 734 nm.
5: The tests were performed in triplicate, and the capture of the free radical was expressed as a percentage of inhibition (% I) of the ABTS radical cation according to the following equation: % inhibition = (absorbance of the solution of the ABTS radical - absorbance of the sample)/(ABTS absorbance radical solution)  100 [ 16].
6: It was also determined that the efficient concentration or EC50% represents the concentration of the sample necessary to sequester 50% of the ABTS root, in which the essential oil will be considered active when it has EC50% < 500  g/mL [ 17].
