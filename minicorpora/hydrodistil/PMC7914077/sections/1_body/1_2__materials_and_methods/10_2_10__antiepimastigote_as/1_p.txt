0: Epimastigote forms of  T. cruzi (10 6 parasites/mL) from a 24-day-old culture were added to 96-well plates, followed by the addition of different concentrations of either  S. aromaticum essential oil or eugenol (10007.81 g/mL), obtained by serial dilutions (1 : 2), at a final volume of 100  L per well, for 72 hours.
1: The controls were identified as follows: blank (wells without parasites), untreated control (parasites and DMSO 1%), and reference drug (benznidazole).
2: With the aid of the hemocytometer and light microscopy, viability was evaluated by counting parasites, and the results were used to calculate the IC 50 (50% inhibition of parasite growth) following the formula: IC 50 = (sample counting)/(control counting)  100 [ 20].
