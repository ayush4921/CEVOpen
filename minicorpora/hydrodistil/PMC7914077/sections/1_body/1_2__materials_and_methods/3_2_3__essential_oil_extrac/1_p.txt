0: The extraction of the essential oil of  S. aromaticum was carried out with 300 g of the ground vegetable product, and it was diluted in water in the proportion of 1 : 10 by hydrodistillation using the Clevenger system for 3h at 100 C. The essential oil collected was dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate (Na 2SO 4), and the final volume found was used to determine the yield through the mass/volume ratio by measuring the density.
1: Mass/volume ratios were calculated from the mass (g) of the initial vegetal material and the volume (mL) of essential oil obtained after extraction.
2: The essential oil samples were kept at 25C and then weighed.
3: For the verification of biological activity  in vitro, the essential oil and the reference drugs were diluted in DMSO, and subsequently serial dilutions were made in an appropriate culture medium until reaching a final concentration below 1% DMSO.
