0: BALB/c peritoneal macrophages (5  10 6 cells/mL) were treated with  S. aromaticum essential oil (200  g/mL) or eugenol (200  g/mL) and either stimulated or not stimulated with  T. cruzi trypomastigotes (5  10 7 parasites/mL).
1: After 48 hours of incubation, the supernatant of cultures was collected and the analysis of nitrite quantification was carried out with Griess reagent.
2: Briefly, in 96-well plates, 50  L of culture supernatant and 50  L of Griess reagent were added (25  L of sulfanilamide 1% in 2.5% H 3PO 4 solution and 25  L of N-(1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine 0.1% solution), followed by incubation in a dark environment for 10 minutes, and read at 570 nm on the spectrophotometer.
3: The nitrite values were obtained from the standard curve of sodium nitrite (1001.5  M) [ 24].
