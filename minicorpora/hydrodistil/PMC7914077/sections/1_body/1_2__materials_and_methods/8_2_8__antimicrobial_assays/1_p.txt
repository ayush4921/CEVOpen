0: The disk diffusion test was performed using the 75  L inoculum of the microbial suspension (1.5  10 8 CFU/mL) seeded on MuellerHinton agar.
1: Soon after, the disks containing 50  L of essential oil and eugenol were fixed on the agar surface.
2: The plates were incubated in a bacteriological oven at 35C for 24 hours.
3: The diameters of the inhibition halos were measured, including the disk diameter, in triplicate [ 19].
4: After checking the antimicrobial potential on the strains tested by the disk diffusion method, the oil was subjected to the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), in which an aliquot of the essential oil of  S. aromaticum and eugenol was transferred to a test tube containing MuellerHinton broth.
5: Then, serial dilutions were performed, resulting in concentrations of 1000, 500, 250, 200, 100, 75, 50, 25, 15, and 5  g/mL.
6: Microbial suspensions containing 1.5  10 8 CFU/mL were added at each concentration and incubated at 35C for 24 h. After the incubation period, the MIC of the oil was determined, being defined as the lowest concentration that visibly inhibited bacterial growth (absence of visible turbidity) [ 18].
