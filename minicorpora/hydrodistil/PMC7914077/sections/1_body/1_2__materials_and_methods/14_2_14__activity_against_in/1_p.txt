0: Initially, trypomastigote forms of  T. cruzi from cultured Vero cells were obtained  in vitro.
1: BALB/c peritoneal macrophages, cultured in 24-well plates (5  10 5 cells/well) with coverslips, were infected with trypomastigotes using the ratio of parasite/cell 10 : 1, at 37C and 5% CO 2 for 6 h. Afterwards, well plates were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2) to remove the noninternalized parasites.
2: The infected cells were treated with different concentrations of  S. aromaticum essential oil or eugenol (20012.5  g/mL) for 24 h. For light microscopy analysis, the coverslips with the infected and treated cells were fixed with Bouin and stained with Giemsa's azur-eosin-methylene blue.
3: The IC 50 was calculated from the total of intracellular amastigotes from 100 cells.
4: The mean number of amastigotes per cell was obtained from the number of intracellular amastigotes in 100 cells divided by the number of infected cells.
5: Benznidazole was used as the reference drug.
6: The selectivity index (SI) was obtained from the ratio between cytotoxicity of BALB/c peritoneal macrophages and activity against intracellular amastigote (SI = CC 50/IC 50) [ 23].
