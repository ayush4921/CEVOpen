0: Different concentrations, obtained by serial dilutions (1 : 2), of essential oils (10007.8  g/mL) or benznidazole (2000.78  g/mL) up to a final volume of 100  L per well were placed in 96-well plates with peritoneal macrophages (5  10 5 cells/mL).
1: The controls were categorized as blank (wells with culture medium without cells), untreated control (cells and DMSO 1%), and reference drug (benznidazole).
2: After 24 h, the cell viability was analyzed by the MTT colorimetric method [ 21].
3: Absorbance was measured in a spectrophotometer at 570 nm wavelength.
4: The concentration inhibiting 50% of cell growth (CC 50) was calculated following the formula: CC 50 = (sample absorbance-blank absorbance)/(control absorbance-blank absorbance)  100 [ 22].
