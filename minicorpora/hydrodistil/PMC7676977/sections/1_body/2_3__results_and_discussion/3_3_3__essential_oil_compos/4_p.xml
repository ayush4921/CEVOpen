<p>Dominant components in caraway oil were carvone (up to 53.05%) and limonene (up to 47.88%), which is also supported by the studies by Venskutonis et al. [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] where in oils acquired from a caraway collection limonene contents up to 55.40% and carvone up to 44.40%. In caraway oil, the content of carvone increased from 46.80% (primary raw material) to 53.05% (secondary sample after 30 min brewing). Caraway oil has antispastic effects, prevents flatulence, and improves the peristalsis of the digestive tract, and it is an antiseptic agent (against
