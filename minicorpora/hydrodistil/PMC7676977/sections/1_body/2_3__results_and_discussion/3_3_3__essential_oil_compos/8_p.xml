<p>The individual components of essential oils are characterised by various levels of stability in water systems, especially in the case of application of a high temperature (water solubility, volatility, chemical reactivity, etc.), which results from differences at the molecular level. Therefore, brewing process conducted at an initial temperature of 95Â°C may result in changes in the content of the individual components, which, in the examples presented here, can be observed in the form of decreasing or increasing trend lines for the percentage contents of volatile components in the distilled oils.</p>
