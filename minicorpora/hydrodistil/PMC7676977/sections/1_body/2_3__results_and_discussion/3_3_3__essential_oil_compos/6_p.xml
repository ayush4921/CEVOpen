<p>The basic components of oil from dried chamomile flowers in the experiment included 
 <italic>α</italic>-bisabolol oxide A (50.89%), 
 <italic>α</italic>-bisabolol oxide B (10.01%), and 
 <italic>α</italic>-bisabolone oxide A (6.80%). As reported by Szőke et al. [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], the contents of the individual components in chamomile oil depend primarily on the chemotype of the plant from which it is extracted. The first chemotype is characterised by a higher content of bisabolol oxide, and the second contains more 
 <italic>α</italic>-bisabolol. The dominant components of chamomile oil are 
 <italic>α</italic>-bisabolol (up to 60%), 
 <italic>α</italic>-bisabolol oxide A (up to 60%), 
 <italic>α</italic>-bisabolol oxide B (up to 50%), chamazulene (i.p. to 25%), and 
 <italic>α</italic>-bisabolone oxide A (up to 12%) [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Chamomile oil is used mainly as a component of complex preparations used in disorders of the alimentary tract.
