<p>Kazimierczak et al. [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] report that the content of flavonoids in sage leaves is 64.91 mg 100
 <sup>−1</sup> g
 <sup>−1</sup>, which, converted to the brew prepared in this study (1:20), corresponds to the concentration of about 32 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup>, and that is in conformance with the concentration in the primary brew from sage leaves in the presented study (from 27.71 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup> for 5 min to 120.60 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup> for 10 min). Frequently, the method of preparation of herbal brews in home conditions during 5 min is not always optimal in terms of achieving the highest concentrations of active substances, valuable in combating numerous diseases, and extension of the brewing time from 5 to 10 minutes can increase their concentration, as in the presented study, even fourfold in the case of sage leaves and dried chamomile flowers.
