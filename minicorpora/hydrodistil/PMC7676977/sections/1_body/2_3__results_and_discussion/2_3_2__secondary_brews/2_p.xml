<p>Analysing the concentration of polyphenols in the secondary brews (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(a)</xref>), generally lower concentrations of those substances in the brews were observed (for 15 min brews: sage 1006.24 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup>—primary brew, 709.23 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup>—secondary brew; lavender 519.20 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup>—primary brew, 470.01 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup>—secondary brew; caraway 182.96 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup>—primary brew, 142.19 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup>—secondary brew; chamomile 440.84 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup>—primary brew, 383.54 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup>—secondary brew; and mint 3966.48 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup>—primary brew, 1455.42 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup>—secondary brew). In the case of fennel fruits, the concentration of polyphenols after secondary infusion was higher than in the case of primary maceration (for 5 min brews: 65.24 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup>—primary brews, 121.16 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup>—secondary brews; for 10 min brews: 101.61 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup>—primary brews, 142.28 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup>—secondary brews). Fruits of fennel are characterised by relatively high hardness, compared to the other experimental materials, and hence, it can be supposed that as a result of primary maceration, their anatomical structures undergo a certain “loosening,” due to which the secondary brewing is more effective. In the case of the concentration of flavonoids in secondary brews, also lower concentrations were found compared to the primary brews (sage 120.60 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup>—primary brews, 60.88 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup>secondary brews; lavender 60.88 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup>—primary brews, 45.78 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup>—secondary brews; caraway 73.59 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup>—primary brews, 37.37 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup>—secondary brews; chamomile 403.53 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup>—primary brews, 178.78 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup>—secondary brews; fennel 109.71 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup>—primary brews, 92.03 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup>—secondary brews; and mint 360.81 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup>—primary brews, 247.52 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup>—secondary brews).
