<p>Therefore, the objective of the study presented herein was the estimation of concentration of polyphenolic compounds, flavonoids, and essential oils in primary and secondary herbal brews, obtained at various time parameters. In addition, an estimation was made of the possibility of reusing the waste plant material after the performed brewing process, through an analysis of the content of selected biologically active substances in that material. Available literature is very poor in research on the content of essential oil in herbal brews. In addition, the research topics regarding the possibility of using postbrewing plant material to obtain essential oils seem to be a topic that brings an innovative approach to research in this area.</p>
