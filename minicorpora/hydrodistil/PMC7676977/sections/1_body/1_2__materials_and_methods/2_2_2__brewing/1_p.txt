0: Weighed portions of 20 g of herbal material were placed in beakers of 1000 ml in volume and poured over with 400 ml of distilled water with initial temperature of 95C; then the whole was covered with watch glass.
1: The process of brewing was conducted in various time variants5 min, 10 min, 15 min, and 30 min (30 min under mechanical stirring).
2: Next, the primary brews were separated from the postbrewing plant material and used for the determination of the content of polyphenolic compounds, flavonoids, and essential oil.
3: In addition, the postbrewing plant material was washed with distilled water at room temperature and subjected again to the process of brewing with distilled water under analogous temperature and time conditions as those described above (secondary brewing).
4: The secondary brews were also analysed for the content of polyphenolic compounds, flavonoids, and essential oil.
5: Each brewing was performed in three replicates and analysed.
6: Figure 1 illustrates the procedure for samples preparation in the experiment.
