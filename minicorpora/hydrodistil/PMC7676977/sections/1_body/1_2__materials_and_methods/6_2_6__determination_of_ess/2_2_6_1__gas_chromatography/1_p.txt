0: GC/MS.
1: ITMS Varian 4000 GC-MS/MS (Varian, USA) equipped with a CP-8410 autoinjector and a 30 m  0.25 mmid.
2: VF-5 ms column (Varian, USA), film thickness 0.25  m, was used; carrier gas He at a rate of 0.5 mlmin 1; injector and detector temperature 250C and 200C, respectively; split ratio 1:50; and injection volume 0.50  l. A temperature gradient was applied (50C for 1 min, then incremented by 4C min 1 to 250C, and then held at 250C for 10 min); ionization energy 70 eV; mass range 40870 Da; and scan time 0.80 s.
