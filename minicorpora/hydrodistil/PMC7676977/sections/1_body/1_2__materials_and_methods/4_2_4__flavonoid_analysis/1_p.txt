0: Determination of flavonoid content in the tested herbal brews was performed by means of spectrophotometry (  = 425 nm) according to a modified Polish Pharmacopoeia VIII [ 11] procedure.
1: The results of the flavonoid content were expressed in quercetin equivalents (Sigma-Aldrich, ACS reagent  98.00%).
2: The results were calculated from the equation of the calibration curve prepared for quercetin standards in the concentration range 1.212 mgL 1 (1.2, 1.8, 3, 9, and 12 mgL 1).
3: Each sample, depending on the material of herbal, was diluted appropriately to the range of the standard curve.
4: All analyses were performed in triplicate.
