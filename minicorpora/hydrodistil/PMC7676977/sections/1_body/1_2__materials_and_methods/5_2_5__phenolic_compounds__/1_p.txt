0: Determinations of phenolic compounds in the tested macerates were made by spectrophotometric means (  = 725 nm) according to a modified Singleton and Rossi method [ 12].
1: The results of the phenols content were expressed in gallic acid equivalents (Sigma-Aldrich, ACS reagent  98.00%).
2: The results were calculated from the equation of the calibration curve prepared for gallic acid standards in the concentration range 1060 mgL 1 (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 mgL 1).
3: Each sample, depending on the material of herbal was diluted appropriately to the range of the standard curve.
4: All analyses were performed in triplicate.
