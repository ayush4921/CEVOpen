0: The availability of several plant species is limited due to their protection status.
1: Increasing pollution and adverse changes occurring in the natural environment result in the shrinkage of plant resources, and the collection of the raw materials from fields in such regions becomes questionable.
2: The alternative solution to these restrictions may be production of plant biomass of the endangered species applying the biotechnological methods.
3: Rapid production of homogeneous and renewable biomass capable of biosynthesis of substances with the pharmacological activity, and most importantly the possibility of strict control of this process, indicate the opportunity for wider application of the biotechnological methods in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industry [ 28, 29].
