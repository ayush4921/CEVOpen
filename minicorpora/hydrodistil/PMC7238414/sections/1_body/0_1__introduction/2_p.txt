0: E. maritimum L. (Sea holly) is a rare perennial under strict law protection in Poland and some European countries.
1: It grows on coastal dunes of the Baltic Sea, the Mediterranean basin, and the Black Sea [ 5].
2: The phytochemical investigations of  E. maritimum revealed the presence of secondary metabolitespolyhydroxylated oleanene triterpenoid saponins [ 6, 7], phenolic acids, mostly rosmarinic and chlorogenic acids [ 8, 9], flavonoids containing mainly kaempferol, astragalin, isoquercitrin, rutin, apigenin, and luteolin [ 8, 9, 10], coumarins [ 9], 20-hydroxyecdysone and polypodine B as the main phytoecdysteroids [ 11], betaines [ 12], and the essential oil [ 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19].
3: Several studies concerning the essential oil composition of  E. maritimum generally investigated aerial parts of the intact plant [ 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19] and no other research dealt with biomass from in vitro cultures.
4: Moreover, the Polish individuals have been examined on the basis of the essential oil characterization for the first time.
