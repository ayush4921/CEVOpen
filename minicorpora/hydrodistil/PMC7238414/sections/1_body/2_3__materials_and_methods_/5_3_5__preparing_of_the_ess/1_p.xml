<p>The essential oils were dissolved in DMSO and then diluted in MHB (bacteria) or SDB (fungi) to a concentration of 50 mg/mL—the leaf oil, and 240 mg/mL—the fruit oil. The final concentration of DMSO not excided 0.1%. The solutions of the essential oils (100 µL) were two-fold serially diluted with MHB (bacteria) and SDB (fungi) in 96 well microtiter plates to the concentrations ranging from 50 mg/mL to 0.10 mg/mL—the leaf oil, and from 240 mg/mL to 0.47 mg/mL—the fruit oil. Simultaneously, a test was carried out determining the antimicrobial activity of DMSO used for the preparation of the stock solution of the essential oils.</p>
