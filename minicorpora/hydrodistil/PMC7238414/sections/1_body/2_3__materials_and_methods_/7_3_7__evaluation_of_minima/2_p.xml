<p>All the microtiter plates were incubated at 34 ± 1 °C for 18 h (bacteria and 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>) and for 72 h (
 <italic>T. mentagrophytes</italic>). The MICs values were recorded as the lowest concentration of the essential oils that inhibited visible growth of the tested microorganisms. In order to determine the minimal bactericidal/fungicidal concentration (MBC/MFC), after recording the MIC endpoint, the concentrations equal to and higher than MIC were subcultured (10 µL) on Trypticase Soy Agar (TSA; OXOID, UK)—bacteria, and SDA—fungi. The MBC was defined as the lowest concentration at which no growth was observed. All the tests were performed in duplicate and the antimicrobial activity was expressed as mean values ± standard deviation (SD).
