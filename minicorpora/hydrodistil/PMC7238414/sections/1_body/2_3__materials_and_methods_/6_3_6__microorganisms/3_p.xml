<p>Filamentous fungi were inoculated on the Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA; OXOID, UK) and incubated at 34 Â°C for adequate formation of conidia. The culture of the 
 <italic>T. mentagrophytes</italic> were covered with a sterile 0.9% NaCl solution supplemented with 0.1% Tween 80. Then the conidia were carefully rubbed with a cotton swab and transferred to a sterile flask. The suspension was homogenized, vortexed, and filtered. The number of conidia (macroconidia and microconidia) in the suspension was determined using haemocytometer chamber as well as the serial dilution agar plating method. Inoculum was examined for the presence of hyphae, and both macroconidia and microconidia were observed.
