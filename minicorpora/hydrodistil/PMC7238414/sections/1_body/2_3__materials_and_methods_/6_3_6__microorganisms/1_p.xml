<p>The following microorganisms were tested: Gram-positive strain 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCC 25923; Gram-negative strain 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> ATCC 25922; yeast 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> ATCC 10231 and dermatophyte 
 <italic>T. mentagrophytes</italic> ATCC 9533. All the strains were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. Amikacin (Sigma-Aldrich, USA; A0368000) and nystatin (Sigma-Aldrich, USA; N4014) were used as reference substances for bacteria and fungi respectively (amikacin—breakpoint for 
 <italic>Enterobacterales</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> according to EUCAST: S ≤ 8, R &gt; 8; nystatin—there is no breakpoint limit range for microdilution tests).
