<p>The activity of the essential oils obtained from 
 <italic>E. maritimum</italic> basal leaves and fruits was evaluated by the broth microdilution method. Both oils were the most active against 
 <italic>T. mentagrophytes</italic> (Minimal Inhibitory Concentration MIC = 1.56 ± 0.0 mg/mL and 7.5 ± 0.0 mg/mL, respectively) and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MIC = 12.5 ± 0.0 mg/mL and 60 ± 0.0 mg/mL, respectively). The essential oil from basal leaves had also the moderate activity against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> (MIC = 12.5 ± 0.0 mg/mL) and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (MIC = 25 ± 0.0 mg/mL) (
