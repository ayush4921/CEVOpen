<p>The root essential oil differed significantly from the fruit and leaf oils. It contained mainly oxygenated monoterpenes menthol (16.8%), menthone (10.9%), and menthyl acetate (5.6%), as well as 2,3,4-trimethylbenzaldehyde (5.6%). According to the research of Darriet et al., [
 <xref rid="B17-plants-09-00417" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], the root oil of this species also differed entirely from the essential oil of the aerial part. However, its composition was different from the presented oil. It contained 2,4,5- (39.8%) and 2,3,6-trimethylbenzaldehyde (29.0%), Î±-muurolene (23.5%), and germacrene D (2%). Various trimethylbenzaldehyde isomers (2,3,4-trimethylbenzaldehyde, 2,4,5-trimethylbenzaldehyde, 2,3,6-trimethylbenzaldehyde, and 2,4,6-trimethylbenzaldehyde) were reported in high concentrations in the essential oil from different parts of

 <xref rid="B30-plants-09-00417" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Unambiguous identification of these isomers is difficult because of the similarity of their mass spectra and different literature data of RIs. In this paper, identification was done on the basis of MassFinder 4.1.
