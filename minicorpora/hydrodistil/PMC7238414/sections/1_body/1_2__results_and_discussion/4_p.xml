<p>In total, more than fifty constituents were identified in each oil. The composition of the intact plant essential oils differed significantly both between plant parts and from the earlier data. However, some similarities were observed in both regards. The main constituents of the leaf and fruit oils were sesquiterpenes and this is in good agreement with the previous reports [
 <xref rid="B14-plants-09-00417" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-plants-09-00417" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,

 <xref rid="B18-plants-09-00417" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The content of the dominant compound of this group, germacrene D, amounted to 45.2% in the fruit oil and 10.5% in the leaf oil. Other important constituents were γ-elemene (6.9%) and β-ylangene (4.0%) in the fruit oil, as well as 2,3,4-trimethylbenzaldehyde (11.3%), spathulenol (4.9%), and neophytadiene (5.2%) in the leaf oil. In the leaf oil, the mixture of two sesquiterpene aldehydes 4βH-cadin-9-en-15-al and 4βH-muurol-9-en-15-al (11.5%) was tentatively identified on the basis of the retention index (RI) because mass spectra were not available. These compounds, together with the corresponding alcohols, were previously isolated from the 
 <italic>E. maritimum</italic> oil and identified by NMR [
 <xref rid="B16-plants-09-00417" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Darriet et al., [
 <xref rid="B17-plants-09-00417" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] analyzed the essential oil of leaves, flowers, stems, and roots and compared the composition of the several oil samples of 
 <italic>E. maritimum</italic> from Corsica and Sardinia. They observed small differences in the composition of the essential oils isolated from aerial parts of the plant and stated that the dominant components were germacrene D (32.1–42.5%), 4βH-cadin-9-en-15-al (18.4–27.6%), 4βH-cadin-9-en-15-ol (2.2–10.5%), and 4βH-muurol-9-en-15-al (4.3–9.3%). The main difference between 12 oil samples was the higher content of germacrene D in the Corsican samples (32.2–45.9%) than in the Sardinian ones (13.7–23.8%) [
 <xref rid="B17-plants-09-00417" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Moreover, the high content of germacrene D (40%) was found in the essential oil of the Portuguese sample [

 <xref rid="B14-plants-09-00417" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In the aerial part oil from the Italian species, the content of germacrene D was similar (10.4%) to the presented study (10.5%) [
 <xref rid="B14-plants-09-00417" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The high amount of germacrene D (13.6–31.7%) was also noticed previously in the fruit essential oil of 
 <italic>E. maritimum</italic> growing on the Tunisian shoreline. The major individual compounds, except germacrene D, were 15-hydroxy-α-muurolene (12.0–18.6%) and germacrene B (6.8–15.0%) [
