<p>The composition of the in vitro shoot essential oil was very similar to the leaf oil. The majority of the identified compounds were found in both oils. What is more, the content of the constituents was similar, with the exception of germacrene D, the content of which was lower in the shoot oil than in the leaf oil (3.8% versus 10.5%). The most important feature that differentiated these oils was the presence of the pronounced amounts (1.2–5.7%) of some sesquiterpenes in the shoot oil, which were found neither in the leaf oil nor in the other two oils, namely hydrocarbons with eremophilane and selinane skeleton, (
 <italic>E</italic>)-nerolidol, and two ketones β-elemenone and germacrone. The absence of hexanal, octanal, and undecan-2-one was noticed in the shoot oil in contrast to the in vitro shoot oil.
