0: Antibacterial activity was evaluated against the Gram-negative bacteria  Proteus vulgaris (ATCC 8427),  Pseudomona aeruginosa (ATCC 27853),  Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922),  Klebsiella pneumonia (ATCC 9997) and  Salmonella typhimurium (LT2), and Gram-positive bacteria  Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923) and  Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212), according to the procedure described by Valarezo, Guaman, Paguay and Meneses [ 38].
1: The bacterial strains were incubated in MH broth and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by the two fold serial dilution method using 96-well microtiter plates [ 44].
2: Tetracycline was used as the positive control for Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and DMSO was considered as negative control (positive growth with 5% DMSO as final concentration).
