0: To carry out the essential oil repellency tests, the method reported by Talukder and Howse [ 47] and modified by Lopez, Lima, Aguero, Lopez, Hadad, Zygadlo, Caballero, Stariolo, Suero, Feresin and Tapia [ 25] was used, with some modifications.
1: Filter paper (Whatman Grade 1, 90 mm diameter circles) was cut in half.
2: In one of the filter paper halves, 1 mL of different concentrations of a solution of essential oil and glycerin was applied homogeneously; the concentrations of the solution were 0.5%, 1%, 2% and 3% of essential oil ( v/ w).
3: One mL of glycerin was placed in the other half of the filter paper.
4: The treated filter papers were allowed to air dry until the solvent evaporated, then the two filter paper semicircles were placed contiguously in a Petri dish.
5: Inside the Petri dish, 10 mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) were released.
6: The count of mosquitoes present in each half was carried out every hour for five hours and a commercial repellent with active ingredient N, N-Diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET) was used as a positive control.
7: To convert the results into a percentage of repulsion (PR), the following formula is applied: PR (%) = (Nc  50)  2, where Nc is the percentage of mosquitoes present in the half where the glycerin was applied (control half).
8: Positive values (+) indicate repellency and negative values () indicate attraction.
9: All tests were repeated three times and mean values were classified according to  Table 5 [ 47].
