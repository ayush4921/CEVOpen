0: The ABTS assay [ 49] with some modifications [ 50] was used to evaluate the free radical scavenging of essential oil as described by Valarezo et al.
1: (2020).
2: The ABTS + radical cation standard solution was prepared by reaction of ABTS and potassium persulfate; this solution was diluted in methanol until an absorbance of 1.1  0.02 was obtained in a spectrophotometer UV with a wavelength of 734 nm.
3: Quantities of 150 L of the essential oil diluted at different concentrations (0.025 to 2.5 mg/mL) were mixed with 2850 L of ABTS and allowed to react for 2 h at room temperature, protected from light, and immediately the absorbance was measured at 734 nm.
4: The same amount of deionized water was used as blank control while BHT and Trolox were used as positive controls.
5: The inhibition of ABTS + radicals was determined as follows: (3)Radical scavenging (%)=[AoAiAo]100 where  Ao is the blank control absorbance and  Ai is the absorbance of the samples.
6: The essential oil concentration providing 50% inhibition (IC 50) was calculated from the graph by plotting inhibition% against sample concentration.
