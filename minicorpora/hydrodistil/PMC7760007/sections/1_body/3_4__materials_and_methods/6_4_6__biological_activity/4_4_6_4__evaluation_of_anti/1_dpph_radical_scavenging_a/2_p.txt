0: The same amount of methanol was added instead of the sample solution as a blank control, and BHT and Trolox were used as positive controls.
1: The percentage of free radical-scavenging capacity was calculated using the following formula: (2)Radical scavenging (%)=[AsAiAs]100 where  Ai is the absorbance of the samples and  As is the absorbance of blank control.
2: The essential oil concentration providing 50% inhibition (IC 50) was calculated from the graph by plotting inhibition% against sample concentration.
