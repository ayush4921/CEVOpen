0: With the aims of knowing the physical nature of essential oil, some of its physical properties were determined.
1: The density of essential oils was determined according to the standard AFNOR NF T 75111 using a pycnometer (1 mL) and an analytical balance (model Mettler AC 100  0.0001).
2: Refraction index was determined according to the standard AFNOR NF T 75112 using a refractometer (model ABBE).
3: The optical rotation was determined according to the standard method ISO 592:1998 using an automatic polarimeter model Mrc-P810.
4: The measurements were performed at 20 C.
