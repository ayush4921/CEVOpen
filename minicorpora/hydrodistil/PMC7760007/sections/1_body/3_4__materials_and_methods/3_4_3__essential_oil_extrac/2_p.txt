0: The plant material previously treated in the release device was immediately hydrodistilled in a semi-pilot distiller (80 L capacity) (Clevenger-type apparatus).
1: The volume vs. time curve was obtained by hydrodistilling the copal fruit for four hours, collecting the essential oil for each period of time (1530 min).
2: Subsequently, the essential oil obtained was dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate and was stored in sealed vials, protecting them from light at 4 C until being used in the analysis [ 38].
