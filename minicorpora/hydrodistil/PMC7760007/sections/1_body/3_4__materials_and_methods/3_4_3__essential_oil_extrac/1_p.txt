0: For the extraction of the essential oil, two processes were carried out: release and isolation.
1: In order to reduce extraction times and increase yields, the essential oil was first released from the vegetal matrix prior to hydrodistillation.
2: The release of the essential oil was carried out by means of a device in the process of patenting called the Device for the release of essential oil from a plant matrix by crushing by immersion centrifugal force (Dispositivo para la liberacion de aceite esencial de una matriz vegetal por trituracion por fuerza centrifuga en inmersion), Application No.
3: IEPI-2014-27173.
4: The crushing of the fruit for the liberation of the essential oil was performed by centrifugal force, in immersion (water) and in vacuum, for 45 to 60 s. The release process was carried out in a single stage.
