 <caption> Effect of pressure, ethanol flow rate, and mole fraction of CO 2 on vetiver oil yield at a fixed temperature of 323 K. ( a) Effect of pressure on vetiver oil yield at a constant CO 2 mole fraction of 0.22 and an ethanol flow rate of 5 mL/min. ( b) Effect of CO 2 mole fraction on vetiver oil yield at a constant pressure of 8.4 MPa and an ethanol flow rate of 5 mL/min. ( c) Effect of the ethanol flow rate on vetiver oil yield at a constant pressure of 8.4 MPa and a CO 2 mole fraction of 0.22. </caption>
