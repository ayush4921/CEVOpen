<p>In this paper, a novel green solvent, CXE, was first applied to extract quality root oil from 
 <italic>Vetiveria zizanioides</italic> (L.) Nash. CXE fluid possessed a strong ability to maintain the more characteristic components, resulting from the varying range of dissolution caused by the regulated fraction of CO
 <sub>2</sub> and the high proportion of ethanol. In the CXE oil, the composition 22 components were identified, including valerenol (18.48%), valerenal (10.21%), and β-cadinene (6.23%), showing an extension of the polarity range from polar to non-polar. Moreover, from the antimicrobial activity assay, CXE oil exhibited a moderate ability against Gram-positive bacteria, especially 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, which was approximately equivalent to traditional samples. Preliminary results of the antioxidant activity from the DPPH scavenging assay were also investigated, presented in the following descending order: IVD &gt; HD &gt; CXE &gt; SFE. In summary, CXE–related extraction, an environmentally friendly technology, is an alternative for the production of vetiver root oil, which basically satisfies and, in some respects, exceeds traditional product criteria. Since the chemical composition of extracts from the root material are always more complex than typical essential oils from other vegetative parts of plants, further development of this novel technique as well as the following refining process is necessary.
