<p>Four bacterial strains were used for antimicrobial ability screening: Gram-positive bacteria, including 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (ATCC No. 6538) and 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (ATCC No. 14579); Gram-negative bacteria, including 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (ATCC No. 27853) and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (ATCC No. 8739). The antimicrobial activity against the above bacteria was evaluated by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) using the microbroth dilution method. Each well of 96 microplates was aliquoted with 50 μL of cation-adjusted Mueller Hinton broth (CAMHB) (Qingdao Hope Bio-Technology Co., Ltd.); the wells of the first row contained 50 μL of pure dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (Shanghai Aladdin Bio-Chem Technology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) (1st lane, negative control), 1% Gentamicin (Shanghai Aladdin Bio-Chem Technology Co., Ltd.) (2nd lane, positive antibiotic control), and 2.5 mg/mL oil samples were serially diluted (from 3rd lane to the 12th lane) and dissolved in DMSO, respectively. The following dilution was performed by transferring 50 μL in each well from the first row to the further one, until the eighth row. The final 50 μL of the solution in the last row was discarded. The tested strains at a concentration of approximately 1.5 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> colony forming units (CFU)/mL were inoculated into each well, after 24 h of incubation at 37 °C [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-24-01897" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Determination of the absorbance at 610 nm was used to detect the absence of turbidity in growth broth, which indicates the effectiveness of the microbial inhibition caused by the tested samples. The final MIC values were determined by the lowest concentrations, and all antimicrobial tests were performed in duplicate.
