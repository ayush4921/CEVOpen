0: A factory situated in Lanxi city uses this conventional technique for the isolation of vetiver essential oil.
1: Briefly, steam was used directly to pass through the vetiver root matrix (small pieces of around 5 cm).
2: The oil-water mixture was obtained after condensation using a specific separator.
3: The commercial oil products, including LFO (density of less than 1 g/mL) and HFO (density larger than 1 g/mL) were collected, respectively.
4: The aspect of LFO is similar to the experimental oil obtained from HD.
5: The middle phase between LFO and HFO is represented by the aromatic water (hydrolat), which can be recycled for production or extraction.
6: The HFO was identified as a sticky, brown oil, possibly containing an abundance of plant lipids.
7: The total yield of commercial vetiver oil was approximately 0.
8: 6%  (w/w).
9: Based on the physical properties, the LFO oil sample was investigated for further analysis.
