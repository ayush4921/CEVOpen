<p>A factory situated in Lanxi city uses this conventional technique for the isolation of vetiver essential oil. Briefly, steam was used directly to pass through the vetiver root matrix (small pieces of around 5 cm). The oil-water mixture was obtained after condensation using a specific separator. The commercial oil products, including LFO (density of less than 1 g/mL) and HFO (density larger than 1 g/mL) were collected, respectively. The aspect of LFO is similar to the experimental oil obtained from HD. The middle phase between LFO and HFO is represented by the aromatic water (hydrolat), which can be recycled for production or extraction. The HFO was identified as a sticky, brown oil, possibly containing an abundance of plant lipids. The total yield of commercial vetiver oil was approximately 0. 6%
