<p>The CXE extraction experiments were performed using a Supercritical Fluid Extraction device (HELIX Applied Separations, Model 7307, Allentown, PA, USA). In total, 25 g of weighed root powder was mixed with 6 g of glass beads (aimed at increasing the contact of the fluid with the root matrix to facilitate the isolation of the oil) and then loaded into a stainless-steel extraction vessel. The experimental design ensured a constant temperature of 323 K, and CO
 <sub>2</sub> was pressurized by the syringe pump to the desired mole fraction of 0.22% measured at an operating pressure of 8.4 MPa. Meanwhile, the ethanol was pumped by the HPLC pump (K-501, Knauer, Berlin, Germany) at a flow rate of 5 mL/min to form the CO
 <sub>2</sub> expanded ethanol (CXE). CXE fluid flowed into the extraction vessel at the operating temperature, followed by the separation vessel at ambient pressure, and collected by the peristaltic pump every 10 min for a total extraction time of 150 min. Solvent was removed by rotary evaporation at 50 Â°C and the oil samples were stored in a refrigerator for further analysis.
