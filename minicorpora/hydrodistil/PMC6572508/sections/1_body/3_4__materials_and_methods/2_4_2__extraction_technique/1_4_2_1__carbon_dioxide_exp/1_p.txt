0: The CXE extraction experiments were performed using a Supercritical Fluid Extraction device (HELIX Applied Separations, Model 7307, Allentown, PA, USA).
1: In total, 25 g of weighed root powder was mixed with 6 g of glass beads (aimed at increasing the contact of the fluid with the root matrix to facilitate the isolation of the oil) and then loaded into a stainless-steel extraction vessel.
2: The experimental design ensured a constant temperature of 323 K, and CO 2 was pressurized by the syringe pump to the desired mole fraction of 0.22% measured at an operating pressure of 8.4 MPa.
3: Meanwhile, the ethanol was pumped by the HPLC pump (K-501, Knauer, Berlin, Germany) at a flow rate of 5 mL/min to form the CO 2 expanded ethanol (CXE).
4: CXE fluid flowed into the extraction vessel at the operating temperature, followed by the separation vessel at ambient pressure, and collected by the peristaltic pump every 10 min for a total extraction time of 150 min.
5: Solvent was removed by rotary evaporation at 50 C and the oil samples were stored in a refrigerator for further analysis.
