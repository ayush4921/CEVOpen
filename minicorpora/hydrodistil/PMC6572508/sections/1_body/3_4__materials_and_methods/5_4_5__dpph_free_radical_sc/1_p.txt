0: The antioxidant activity of the vetiver essential oil was measured by the DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) free radical scavenging assay.
1: The gradual concentrations of the essential oil samples, i.e., 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 120 mg/mL, were prepared accurately in ethanol.
2: For each well of the 96 microplates, 0.15 mL of a 0.05 mmol/L ethanolic DPPH was mixed with the tested 0.15 mL oil sample [ 36].
3: The reaction liquid was incubated in the dark at room temperature for 30 min and the absorbance was read at 517 nm using a Multimode Microplate Reader (Tecan, Infinite M200 PRO, AU).
4: The standard antioxidant, ascorbic acid, was used as a negative control.
5: The free radical scavenging activity of each solution was calculated according to the following formula: (2)IDPPH% = (1  AblackAsample)  100
