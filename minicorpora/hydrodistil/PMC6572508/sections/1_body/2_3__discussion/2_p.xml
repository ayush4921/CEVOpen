<p>Since CXE was firstly used as a solvent to produce vetiver root oil, it was necessary to find the proper extraction conditions and to optimize the operating conditions. All experiments of CXE extraction were performed at a constant temperature of 323 K, because both the previous experimental results and the analysis of literature [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-24-01897" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] show that the temperature of CXE fluid is not significant for extraction, but should be maintained over the critical value (T
 <sub>c</sub> = 313K). At the temperature of 323 K, the effect of three major operating parameters of CXE, including pressure, mole fraction of CO
 <sub>2</sub>, and flow rate of ethanol, on the vetiver oil yield was investigated, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01897-f002">Figure 2</xref>. The result in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01897-f002">Figure 2</xref>a shows that the oil yield increased significantly with the rise of pressure from 5 MPa to 9.3 MPa at a constant mole fraction of CO
 <sub>2</sub> of 0.22 and ethanol flow rate of 5 mL/min. The pressure was a key factor that could alter the existence form of CO
 <sub>2</sub> in the CXE from the subcritical to supercritical state, further resulting in a change of the solubility as well as other fluid properties, especially the density and viscosity, which mainly depended on the expansion extent of the systemic volume. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01897-f002">Figure 2</xref>b, at a constant pressure of 8.4 MPa and an ethanol flow rate of 5 mL/min, the yield of vetiver oil increased from 4.5% to 5.4% with the CO
 <sub>2</sub> mole fraction rising from 0.16 to 0.22. The amount of CO
 <sub>2</sub> that is added should be controlled within a relatively narrow range to ensure the intact CXE fluid exhibits a phase that is as homogenous as possible, because phasic separation is usually adverse to solute extraction. The experimental result showed that even a slight change of the mole fraction of CO
 <sub>2</sub> might influence the polarity of the fluid, causing fluctuations of the oil yield. As illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01897-f002">Figure 2</xref>c, the vetiver yield increased from 3.5% to 7.4% with the flow rate of ethanol changing from 3 to 8 mL/min at a constant pressure and CO
 <sub>2</sub> mole fraction. If the extraction time was fixed for 3 h, the flow rate of ethanol mainly determined the final consumption of the CXE fluid. In particular, the slower flow rate of 5 mL/min had a higher yield of 7.42%, probably because the extracting process could be performed in adequate surroundings of the material matrix into the CXE fluid. Especially, a higher flow rate of ethanol of 8 mL/min had a lower oil yield of 5.12%, which is a result of a partial extraction of vetiver solutes due to the non-uniform excess of the solvent in the matrix. CXE exhibited a higher yield than that obtained with conventional methods (0.3%â€“0.6%) and SFE (0.5%).
