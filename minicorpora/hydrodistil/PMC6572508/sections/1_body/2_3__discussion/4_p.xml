<p>The antimicrobial activity of the vetiver oil samples demonstrated a significant ability against Gram-positive bacteria, especially 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, as well as 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and a relatively poor activity against the Gram negative bacilli, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-24-01897" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Similar to the results from the literature, Gram-positive bacteria are usually more vulnerable to natural plant extracts compared to Gram-negative bacteria [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-24-01897" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. According to the literature [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-24-01897" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], the strong antimicrobial activity of HD oil can be attributed to the presence of alcohols (2.77%). In addition, the moderate activity of CXE can be justified by ketones (1.54%), as it is reported that they can exhibit a potential ability.
