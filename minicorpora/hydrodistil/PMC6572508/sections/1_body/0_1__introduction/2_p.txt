0: Hydrodistillation is the most widely used conventional method for the isolation of volatile compounds from plant materials [ 10].
1: In general, the traditional extraction of vetiver oil using hydrodistillation usually lasts over 10 h [ 11, 12] at relatively high temperatures (steam or boiling water) [ 13], resulting in the break-down of some oxidizable and thermolabile components as well as a severe decline of the oil yield [ 14].
2: However, in recent years, many articles reported a novel extraction method for an oil-fat mixture [ 15, 16] based on CO 2 expanded ethanol (CXE) or CO 2-pressurized ethanol, which has been successfully used for the isolation of carotenoid pigment accumulated in  Haematococcus pluvialis [ 17],  -pinene, and  cis-verbenol from tree resin ( Boswellia sacra) [ 16] and phenolic compounds from garlic husk ( Allium sativum L.) [ 18, 19].
