0: Apparently, although the major component of CXE is a typical polar solvent, ethanol, the addition of CO 2 may effectively promote the inherent properties, including the specific dissolving ability as well as the mass-transfer efficiency [ 20, 21, 22], being able to extract relatively complex oil from the matrix [ 14].
1: Different from supercritical fluid (SCF) [ 11], CXE has an enhanced solubility for various solutes, which can be used for the extraction of both non-polar and moderately polar components [ 17, 23].
2: From the above analysis, as an environmentally friendly solvent, CXE fluid may have potential in improving the fundamental and functional properties of vetiver root oil extraction.
