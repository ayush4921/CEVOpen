<p>In this study, the antioxidant activity of essential oils from 
 <italic>Vetiveria zizanioides</italic> roots were evaluated by a DPPHÂ· (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl free radical) scavenging assay in contrast with a well-known hydrophilic antioxidant, ascorbic acid (Vc). The median inhibitory concentration 50 (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) values of the vetiver essential oils and the standard antioxidant, ascorbic acid, are shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01897-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of the five different essential oil samples ranged from 1.39 to 4.54 mg/mL. Since low values of IC
 <sub>50</sub> represent high antioxidant activity, the ability of oil samples can be observed in the following order: IVD oil (2.19 mg/mL) &gt; HD oil (3.57 mg/mL) &gt; CXE oil (3.71 mg/mL) &gt; SFE oil (4.54 mg/mL). Also shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-01897-f001">Figure 1</xref>, the CXE vetiver oil was anticipated to have approximately similar results with the traditional techniques.
