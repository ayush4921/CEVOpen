<p>The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of five different samples of vetiver essential oils against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria are illustrated in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01897-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. CXE oil exhibited a relatively strong antimicrobial ability against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MIC = 78 μg/mL) and a weak activity against 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (MIC = 312.5 μg/mL), 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (MIC = 312.5 μg/mL), and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (MIC = 2500 μg/mL). SFE oil presented a moderate activity against the same Gram positive bacteria, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus,</italic> similar to CXE oil, it had a poor ability against 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (MIC = 156 μg/mL), 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (MIC = 312.5 μg/mL), and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (MIC = 625 μg/mL). The essential oil extracted from vetiver root using HD showed a powerful antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MIC = 39 μg/mL), but also a moderate activity against 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (MIC = 312.5 μg/mL), 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (MIC = 312.5 μg/mL), and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (MIC = 312.5 μg/mL). The essential oil obtained from IVD, especially LFO (light fraction oil), displayed an evident antimicrobial ability against Gram-positive bacteria, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MIC = 78 μg/mL), but HFO (MIC = 156 μg/mL) displayed opposite result regarding the same bacteria. In accordance with the results, conventional and traditional methods have significant antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, especially 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>.
