<p>The chemical compositions of vetiver oils obtained from the extraction methods (CXE, SFE, HD, and IVD) are presented in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-01897-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Based on the GC-MS analysis of oil samples from the four above methods, a total of 48 components were identified and then grouped into four classes, including hydrocarbons, alcohols, carbonyl compounds, and carboxylic acids. Traditional and CXE oil showed a larger variety of components, such as alcohols and carboxylic acids, with the relevant amounts of 2.77% and 2.66% detected, respectively. Also, it was found that carbonyl compounds exist in CXE oil (5.42%) and IVD oil (1.54%). Furthermore, SFE oil is mainly composed of hydrocarbons (81.91%), which can be used as a potential food additive, while HD oil has an applicable usage in the perfumery and cosmetic industry [

Firstly, for the root oil from traditional hydrodistillation, 21 volatiles were observed with three main chemical compounds, cedr-8-en-13-ol (26.54%), β-guaiene (15.31%), and cycloisolongifolene (11.09%), which were also identified in previous reports [

Besides the one compound, cedr-8-en-13-ol (9.74%), being the same as HD oil, cycloisolongifolene (6.56%) and khusimene (5.86%) were merely present in the IVD oil, possibly exhibiting a strong ability to inhibit lipid peroxidation according to early findings. In contrast to the HD oil, the new method of CXE extraction obtained a total of 22 components, but the main components of CXE oil, including valerenol (18.48%), valerenal (10.21%), and β-cadinene (6.23%), were distinctly different from the HD oil. Furthermore, the oil produced by another green technique, SFE, exhibited a relatively simple chemical composition, solely containing 10 components and being predominated by hydrocarbons. In addition, it should be noted that although some minor components, such as khusimene, δ-selinene, and β-vetivenene, probably accounted for a low percent rate, they might be contribute to specific odor of vetiver oil. Notably, it was certain that the variation of the chemical composition due to the use of the new method instead of conventional ones would result in a possible promotion of the profiles of vetiver oil, such as reducing the unpleasant smoky fragrance, enhancing the bioactivity, and so on.
