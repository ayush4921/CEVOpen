0: One of the main strategic points at which the poultry industry can optimize the efficiency of production is the sanitation of fertile eggs.
1: Reducing the microbial load of eggshells can minimize the occurrence and prevalence of pathogenic microorganisms, which are severely harmful to embryonic development and maximize hatchability and chick quality ( Shahein and Sedeek, 2014).
2: The sanitizing compound commonly used in farms and hatcheries is paraformaldehyde, which is effective for maintaining low contamination levels of eggshells ( Williams, 1970;  Whistler and Sheldon, 1989).
3: However, paraformaldehyde is highly toxic to the health of the professionals who handle it and to chick embryos and harmful to the environment ( Casteel et al., 1987;  Roca et al., 2008;  Cadirci, 2009;  Unsaldi and Ciftci, 2010;  Rhomberg, 2015).
4: Zeweil et al.
5: (2015), for example, observed that paraformaldehyde can cause malformations in developing chick embryos.
