<p id="p0015">One of the main strategic points at which the poultry industry can optimize the efficiency of production is the sanitation of fertile eggs. Reducing the microbial load of eggshells can minimize the occurrence and prevalence of pathogenic microorganisms, which are severely harmful to embryonic development and maximize hatchability and chick quality (
