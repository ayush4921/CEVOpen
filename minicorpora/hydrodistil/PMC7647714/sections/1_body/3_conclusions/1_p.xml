<p id="p0225">Clove essential oil is effective and safe for eggs intended for incubation. Its use as an alternative to paraformaldehyde in the sanitation of fertile eggs is strongly recommended because it reduces the eggshell microbial load, resulting in good incubation parameters and better neonatal chick quality. Furthermore, our data indirectly suggest that the application of clove essential oil does not negatively affect the structural integrity of the cuticle on the eggshell surface or the development of the embryo.</p>
