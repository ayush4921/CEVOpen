<p id="p0065">Sanitation procedures were performed in a room at a commercial hatchery (Planaltina, Federal District, Brazil) 20 min after egg collection. The eggs from treatment T1 (negative control) were kept in the same room as the other treatments and did not receive any sanitation procedure. In the T2 (grain alcohol) and T3 (clove essential oil) treatments, eggs were homogeneously sprayed over their entire surface with manual sprayers. After spraying, the eggs were placed in sterile trays for drying at room temperature for 30 to 50 min. At the same time, the eggs from treatment T4 (paraformaldehyde) were sent for fumigation. In this process, a concentration of 6 g/m³ paraformaldehyde was used. Burning of the product, fumigation, and gas exhaustion proceeded for 20 min in a completely closed chamber, according to the guidelines of the commercial hatchery. The relative humidity and temperature in the chamber were 70% and 25°C, respectively.</p>
