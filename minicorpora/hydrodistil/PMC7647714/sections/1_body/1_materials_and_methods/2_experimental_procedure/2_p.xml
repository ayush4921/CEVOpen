<p id="p0040">Internal egg quality was measured using the Haugh unit and yolk index of 80 eggs (20 per treatment). There was no significant difference among treatments, preventing egg quality from interfering with the incubation results. The mean Haugh unit of the eggs was 85.65 ± 7.31 (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.2830; coefficient of variation [
 <bold>CV</bold>] = 8.30%), and they were classified as “AA”, that is, of excellent quality (
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">USDA, 2000</xref>). The calculated yolk index was 0.39 ± 0.03 (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.6647; CV = 7.33%). These analyses were also essential because the internal structure of the egg has the potential to meet the nutrient and energy demands of embryos until hatching.
