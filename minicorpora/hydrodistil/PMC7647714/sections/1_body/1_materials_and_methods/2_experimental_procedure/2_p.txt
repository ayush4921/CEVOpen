0: Internal egg quality was measured using the Haugh unit and yolk index of 80 eggs (20 per treatment).
1: There was no significant difference among treatments, preventing egg quality from interfering with the incubation results.
2: The mean Haugh unit of the eggs was 85.65  7.31 ( P = 0.2830; coefficient of variation [ CV] = 8.30%), and they were classified as AA, that is, of excellent quality ( USDA, 2000).
3: The calculated yolk index was 0.39  0.03 ( P = 0.6647; CV = 7.33%).
4: These analyses were also essential because the internal structure of the egg has the potential to meet the nutrient and energy demands of embryos until hatching.
