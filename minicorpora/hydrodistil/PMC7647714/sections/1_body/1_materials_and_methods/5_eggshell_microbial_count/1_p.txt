0: A method adapted from  Fasenko et al.
1: (2009) was used to count microbes on the eggshell.
2: One hour after sanitation, 20 eggs from each treatment were placed into sterile plastic bags (pooled sample of 4 eggs per bag) labeled according to treatment and transported under cooling to the laboratory of microbiology (Federal Institute of Brasilia, Planaltina), where the analyses of eggshell microbial count were performed.
3: Each bag containing a pooled sample of 4 eggs was reopened, and 220 mL of 0.1% peptone saline solution (Kasvi, Sao Jose dos Pinhais, Parana, Brazil) was added.
4: The eggs were manually massaged for 5 min to extract the microbial load.
5: Then, a 1.0-mL aliquot was removed from each bag, and serial decimal dilutions in 0.1% peptone saline solution were performed for each sample.
6: A 1.0-mL aliquot of each dilution was plated on standard plate count agar (Neogen), violet red bile glucose agar (Kasvi), and potato dextrose agar (HiMedia) to count of total aerobic mesophilic bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, and molds and yeasts, respectively.
7: The plates containing plate count agar and violet red bile glucose agar were incubated at 37C for 48 h, and the plates with potato dextrose agar were incubated at 29C for 6 D. After the incubation period, the colonies formed were counted, and the results are expressed in log 10 CFU/mL of pooled sample of 4 eggs.
