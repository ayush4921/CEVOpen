<p id="p0135">A method adapted from 
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Barbosa et al. (2012)</xref> was used to evaluate eggshell thickness. After the chicks hatched, 50 eggshells from each treatment were separated and dried at room temperature for 3 D. Then, the thickness of each eggshell was measured without removing its internal membranes, and means were obtained from 3 different points at the equatorial plane of the eggshell using a digital caliper with 0.001-mm precision (Mitutoyo).
