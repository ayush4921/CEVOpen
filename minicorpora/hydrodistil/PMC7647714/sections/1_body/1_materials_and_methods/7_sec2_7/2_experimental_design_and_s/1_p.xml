<p id="p0145">The experiment followed a randomized block design with 4 treatments. The analysis of incubation yield was based on 4 replicates per treatment, in which each tray of 80 eggs constituted a replicate. To analyze eggshell thickness and chick yield and quality, each egg and chick were considered a replicate. A completely randomized experimental design was used for eggshell bacterial count, with 5 replicates each, in which each pooled sample of 4 eggs was considered a replicate. Data were subjected to analysis of variance in SAS Studio University Edition software (SAS Inst. Inc., Cary, NC). Means were tested for significant differences by Tukey's test when the assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity were met. When the test for normality distribution or homogeneity of variances failed, the Kruskal-Wallis test was used. Statistical significance for all tests was considered at
