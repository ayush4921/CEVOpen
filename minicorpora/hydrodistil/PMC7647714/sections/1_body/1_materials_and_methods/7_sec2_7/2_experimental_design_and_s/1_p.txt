0: The experiment followed a randomized block design with 4 treatments.
1: The analysis of incubation yield was based on 4 replicates per treatment, in which each tray of 80 eggs constituted a replicate.
2: To analyze eggshell thickness and chick yield and quality, each egg and chick were considered a replicate.
3: A completely randomized experimental design was used for eggshell bacterial count, with 5 replicates each, in which each pooled sample of 4 eggs was considered a replicate.
4: Data were subjected to analysis of variance in SAS Studio University Edition software (SAS Inst.
5: Inc., Cary, NC).
6: Means were tested for significant differences by Tukey's test when the assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity were met.
7: When the test for normality distribution or homogeneity of variances failed, the Kruskal-Wallis test was used.
8: Statistical significance for all tests was considered at  P < 0.05.
