<p id="p0055">For this test, bacterial strains (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were activated in brain heart infusion broth (Neogen, Lansing, MI) and incubated for approximately 24 h at 36°C. Subsequently, they were standardized in sterile saline (NaCl 0.85%) until a turbidity compatible with grade 0.5 of the McFarland scale (1.5 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/mL) was obtained. The oil was weighed to determine the volume that comprised 100 mg. This amount was used in testing as the full-strength (100%) concentration and was then serially diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide (
 <bold>DMSO</bold> 5%; Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO). The sterile filter paper discs (4 mm) were impregnated with 10 μL of clove essential oil in concentrations ranging from 50 to 0.39% (p/v) and then deposited with sterile forceps on the surface of the Petri dishes containing the culture medium (Mueller-Hinton agar, HiMedia, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India), which was previously inoculated with 100 μL of bacteria. A pure DMSO control was included with each test to ensure that microbial growth was not inhibited by DMSO itself. Chloramphenicol (30 μg/disc; Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a positive control. Plates were then inverted and incubated for approximately 24 h at 36°C, and the diameter of the inhibition zones was measured in millimeters using a digital caliper with 0.001-mm precision (Mitutoyo, Suzano, São Paulo, Brazil). Each test was performed with 3 replicates.
