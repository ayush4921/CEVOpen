0: Dried clove flower buds were obtained from a commercial market in Brasilia, Federal District, Brazil.
1: The essential oil was extracted in a laboratory of natural product chemistry (Federal Institute of Brasilia, Gama, Federal District, Brazil) by a method adapted from  Ascencao and Filho (2013) involving hydrodistillation with the Clevenger extraction system (Vidrolabo, Poa, Sao Paulo, Brazil).
2: The chemical analysis of the clove essential oil by means of gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry allowed the identification of 3 components, with eugenol (89.97%) being the main component ( Table 2).
3: The structures were defined on the basis of retention times, calculation of the Kovats index, the Wiley7, FFNSCl.3, and NIST08 databases and comparison with data from  Adams (2017).
