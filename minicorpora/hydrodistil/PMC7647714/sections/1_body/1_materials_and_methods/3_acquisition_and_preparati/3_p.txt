0: For this test, bacterial strains (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were activated in brain heart infusion broth (Neogen, Lansing, MI) and incubated for approximately 24 h at 36C.
1: Subsequently, they were standardized in sterile saline (NaCl 0.85%) until a turbidity compatible with grade 0.5 of the McFarland scale (1.5  10 8 CFU/mL) was obtained.
2: The oil was weighed to determine the volume that comprised 100 mg.
3: This amount was used in testing as the full-strength (100%) concentration and was then serially diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO 5%; Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO).
4: The sterile filter paper discs (4 mm) were impregnated with 10 L of clove essential oil in concentrations ranging from 50 to 0.39% (p/v) and then deposited with sterile forceps on the surface of the Petri dishes containing the culture medium (Mueller-Hinton agar, HiMedia, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India), which was previously inoculated with 100 L of bacteria.
5: A pure DMSO control was included with each test to ensure that microbial growth was not inhibited by DMSO itself.
6: Chloramphenicol (30 g/disc; Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a positive control.
7: Plates were then inverted and incubated for approximately 24 h at 36C, and the diameter of the inhibition zones was measured in millimeters using a digital caliper with 0.001-mm precision (Mitutoyo, Suzano, Sao Paulo, Brazil).
8: Each test was performed with 3 replicates.
