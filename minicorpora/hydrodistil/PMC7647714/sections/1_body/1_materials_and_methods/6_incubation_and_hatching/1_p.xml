<p id="p0075">After the sanitation process, the eggs were transported to a laboratory of poultry science (Federal Institute of Brasília, Planaltina). The eggs were stored for 3 D at a temperature of 16°C to 18°C and a 55 to 60% relative humidity. The eggs were then separated by treatment into incubation trays with a capacity of 80 eggs each. For each treatment, 4 incubation trays were used, totaling 320 eggs. The incubation trays containing the eggs were individually weighed and randomly distributed into 4 single-stage setters (Luna 480, Chocmaster, Curitiba, Paraná, Brazil), as shown in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>. The setters were in an air-conditioned room at 22°C to 24°C and 50 to 55% humidity. These meteorological variables were monitored by 2 thermohygrometers (Testo 608-H1, Campinas, São Paulo, Brazil) to ensure the proper functioning of the setters.
