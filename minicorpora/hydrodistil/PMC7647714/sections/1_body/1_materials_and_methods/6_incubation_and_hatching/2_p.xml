<p id="p0080">The setters were operated at a mean temperature of 37.7°C (99.86°F), a mean relative humidity of 60%, and with automatic turning every hour at a 45° angle for the first 18 D of incubation. On the eighth day (192 h of incubation), all eggs were candled to remove infertile eggs and eggs with early embryonic mortality. Starting on day 19 (456 h of incubation), the incubation trays were weighed again, and the incubators were operated at a mean temperature of 36.6°C (97.88°F) and a 65% relative humidity. After 21 D (504 h of incubation), the unhatched eggs were counted, opened, and evaluated to determine the number of infertile eggs, the period of embryonic mortality (early [0–7 D], mid [8–18 D], and late [19–21 D plus pipped]), and the number of contaminated eggs.</p>
