0: The setters were operated at a mean temperature of 37.7C (99.86F), a mean relative humidity of 60%, and with automatic turning every hour at a 45 angle for the first 18 D of incubation.
1: On the eighth day (192 h of incubation), all eggs were candled to remove infertile eggs and eggs with early embryonic mortality.
2: Starting on day 19 (456 h of incubation), the incubation trays were weighed again, and the incubators were operated at a mean temperature of 36.6C (97.88F) and a 65% relative humidity.
3: After 21 D (504 h of incubation), the unhatched eggs were counted, opened, and evaluated to determine the number of infertile eggs, the period of embryonic mortality (early [07 D], mid [818 D], and late [1921 D plus pipped]), and the number of contaminated eggs.
