0: After the end of the incubation process, the percentages of egg weight loss (%), fertility (%), hatchability of set eggs (%), hatchability of fertile eggs (%), early dead (%), mid dead (%), late dead (%), contaminated eggs (%), and chick yield (%) were calculated per  Aviagen (2011) and  Baylan et al.
1: (2018) using equations 1 to 9, respectively.
2: 1)Egg weight loss (%) = [(initial egg weight  egg weight measured on the transfer day)/initial egg weight]  100.2)Fertility (%) = (number of fertilized eggs/number of eggs set)  100.3)Hatchability of set eggs (%) = (number of hatched chicks/total number of set eggs)  100.4)Hatchability of fertile eggs (%) = (number of hatched chicks/number of fertile eggs)  100.5)Early dead (%) = (number of dead embryos on days 07 of incubation/number of fertile eggs)  100.6)Mid dead (%) = (number of dead embryos on days 818 of incubation/number of fertile eggs)  100.7)Late dead (%) = (number of dead embryos on days 1921 of incubation/number of fertile eggs)  100.8)Contaminated eggs (%) = (number of contaminated eggs/number of fertile eggs)  100.9)Chick yield (%) = (chick weight on the day of hatch/initial egg weight)  100.
