0: After the sanitation process, the eggs were transported to a laboratory of poultry science (Federal Institute of Brasilia, Planaltina).
1: The eggs were stored for 3 D at a temperature of 16C to 18C and a 55 to 60% relative humidity.
2: The eggs were then separated by treatment into incubation trays with a capacity of 80 eggs each.
3: For each treatment, 4 incubation trays were used, totaling 320 eggs.
4: The incubation trays containing the eggs were individually weighed and randomly distributed into 4 single-stage setters (Luna 480, Chocmaster, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil), as shown in  Figure 2.
5: The setters were in an air-conditioned room at 22C to 24C and 50 to 55% humidity.
6: These meteorological variables were monitored by 2 thermohygrometers (Testo 608-H1, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil) to ensure the proper functioning of the setters.
