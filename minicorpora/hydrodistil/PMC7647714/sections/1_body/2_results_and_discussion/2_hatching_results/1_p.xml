 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). This parameter is more strongly influenced by physical factors essential for incubation, such as temperature and relative humidity (

In this experiment, as the eggs were subjected to the same incubation conditions, no difference between the treatments was expected. In addition, evaluating egg weight loss during incubation allowed us to indirectly estimate the level of sanitizers damage to the cuticle, and, consequently, embryonic development (
