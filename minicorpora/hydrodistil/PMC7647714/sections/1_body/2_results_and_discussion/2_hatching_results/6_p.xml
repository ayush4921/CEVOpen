 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0197; CV = 18.69%) in embryonic mortality during the late incubation stage in eggs sprayed with clove essential oil (8.67 ± 3.86%) compared with eggs sprayed with grain alcohol (13.60 ± 1.00) and eggs in the negative control group (13.41 ± 2.24%). In this context, 
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Copur et al. (2011)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Baylan et al. (2018)</xref> reported that a decrease in early and late mortality may be the result of reduced eggshell contamination. Therefore, the lower mortality percentage observed in the late incubation stage of eggs treated with clove essential oil may be associated with decreased microbial populations on the eggshell because of the action of the chemical constituents present in the oil.
