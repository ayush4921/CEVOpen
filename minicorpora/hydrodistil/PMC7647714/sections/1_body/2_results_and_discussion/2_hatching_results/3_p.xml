<p id="p0180">A significant difference was observed for the hatchability of set eggs (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0027, CV = 4.07%; 
 <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). The eggs treated with clove essential oil hatched at a mean rate of 70.81 ± 2.40%, which was similar to the mean of 66.87 ± 4.48% observed in the group fumigated with paraformaldehyde and significantly higher than that in the negative control (61.63 ± 3.32%) and grain alcohol (60.32 ± 2.89%) groups. This result can be attributed to the effects of the treatments, as there was no significant difference in the fertility rate.
