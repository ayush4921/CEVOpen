<p id="p0220">Eggshell thickness is one of the factors that affects gas exchange and moisture loss during embryonic development (

 <xref rid="tbl7" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>) between the means of eggshell thickness (0.365 ± 0.026 mm) showed that the tested treatments did not negatively affect this variable, even though the application of sanitizing agents to eggs can affect eggshell structure (
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Kim and Slavik, 1996</xref>). 
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Oliveira et al. (2020)</xref> also did not observe significant differences in the thickness of eggshells treated with grain alcohol, clove essential oil, ethanolic extract of propolis, or paraformaldehyde (mean of 0.37 ± 0.029 mm).
