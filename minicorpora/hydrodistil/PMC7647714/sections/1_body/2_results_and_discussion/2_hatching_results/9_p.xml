<p id="p0210">Chick yield allows us to infer whether the incubation time and parameters were correct, with ideal chick yield values ranging between 67 and 68% (
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Aviagen, 2011</xref>). In the present experiment, all treatments presented yields classified as “slightly high” (68.55 ± 0.76%) but close to acceptable. The data observed in this study differ from those reported by 
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Oliveira et al. (2020)</xref>, who observed that eggs sanitized with grain alcohol (67.50 ± 1.92%), clove essential oil (67.90 ± 1.87%), or paraformaldehyde (67.80 ± 1.85%) showed chick yields classified as ideal. However, because in both experiments the eggs were subjected to ideal temperature and humidity conditions, a possible explanation for these contradictory results may be the egg weight loss observed in the present study, which, despite being within the ideal range reported in the literature (
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Molenaar et al., 2010</xref>), resulted in heavy chicks.
