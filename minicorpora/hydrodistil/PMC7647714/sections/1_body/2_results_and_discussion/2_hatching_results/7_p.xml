 <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). The largest percentage of contaminated eggs was observed in the negative control group (3.13 ± 1.25%), followed by the grain alcohol (2.81 ± 0.84%), paraformaldehyde (0.81 ± 0.94%), and clove essential oil (0.38 ± 0.76%) groups. These results reinforce that the clove essential oil-based sanitizing agent presents a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity and may have been able to maintain low levels of microorganisms on the eggs during incubation, because according to 
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Magwood (1964)</xref>, there is a significant increase in the bacterial count on the eggshell during this period.
