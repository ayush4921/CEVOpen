<p id="p0185">The hatchability of fertile eggs (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0043; CV = 3.86%) differed significantly between the studied treatments (
 <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). The mean values for the eggs treated with clove essential oil (84.69 ± 1.65%) and paraformaldehyde (81.87 ± 3.92%) were statistically similar but were higher than those for the negative control (74.03 ± 3.58%) and the eggs treated with grain alcohol (73.59 ± 2.87%).
