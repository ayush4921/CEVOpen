 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0723; CV = 0.91%) and yield (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.2122; CV = 1.05%) did not differ between treatments (
 <xref rid="tbl6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). However, there was a significant difference (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001; CV = 2.48%) in the physical quality score of the chicks. Chick weight is strongly associated with the weight of the egg from which the chick hatches (
 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Morris et al., 1968</xref>). As no differences were observed in initial egg weight or weight loss, differences in the initial weight of the chicks were not expected.
