<p id="p0215">In the Pasgar© score assessment, it was determined that the clove essential oil (9.21 ± 0.89%) had a superior effect on the physical quality of the chicks compared with that of the other treatments. It is known that if eggs intended for incubation are not sanitized with effective products before being placed in the incubators, chick quality may decrease because of the high bacterial contamination that may occur, which may cause infection of the yolk sac (

 <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Cortés et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, the microbial contamination level may be an indicator of chick quality. Thus, more viable chicks were obtained in the clove essential oil treatment because this sanitizer reduces microbial populations and does not adversely affect embryos or chicks.
