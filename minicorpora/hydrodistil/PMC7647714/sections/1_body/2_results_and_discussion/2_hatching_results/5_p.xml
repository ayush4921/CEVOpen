 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Oliveira et al. (2020)</xref> compared the hatchability of fertile eggs between clove essential oil treatment at a concentration of 0.6 mg/mL (92.37 ± 3.25%) and paraformaldehyde treatment (94.44 ± 4.54%) and did not observe significant differences. 
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Copur et al. (2010)</xref> evaluated the effect of oregano essential oil at 2 concentrations (0.55 and 0.75 mL/cm
 <sup>3</sup>) and 2 exposure times (3 and 6 h) on the sanitation of eggs intended for incubation and observed that the hatchability of these eggs (90.00%) did not differ significantly from the hatchability of formaldehyde-treated eggs (89.91%). Thus, sanitation with clove essential oil increased hatchability compared with that of nonsanitized eggs, possibly because of control of the bacterial load on the eggshell surface.
