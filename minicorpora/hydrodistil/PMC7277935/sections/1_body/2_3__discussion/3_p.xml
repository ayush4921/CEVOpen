<p>The antibacterial activity analysis revealed that while the essential oil of 
 <italic>O. odorifera</italic> and safrole presented clinically ineffective antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, they presented clinically relevant MIC values against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. The data obtained by this study suggest that safrole is, at least partially, responsible for the antibacterial effects of the EOOO. It is still suggested that both the oil and the isolated compound are more effective against Gram-positive strains, which may be justified by differences in the constitution of the membrane of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
