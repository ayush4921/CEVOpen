<p>Previous studies suggest that chlorpromazine affects the membrane potassium flow in 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. However, in multi-drug resistant strains, a significant inhibition is observed only at concentrations above 50 ÂµM [

Curiously, studies have shown that this drug also acts as a strong inhibitor of the NorA efflux pump, and there is evidence that the interaction between this drug and the amino acid residues is favored by its hydrophobic properties and molecular dimension, corroborating the findings shown in the interaction map [
