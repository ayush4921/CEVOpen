<p>The present research investigated the antibacterial effects of the essential oil of 
 <italic>O. odorifera</italic> and its major constituent safrole against multi-resistant strains. The phytochemical analysis identified 93.1% of the total constituents of the EOOO, revealing the presence of 16 different compounds, including safrole as a major constituent. This finding is corroborated by a previous study showing a similar composition, as well as the presence of safrole as the principal component of essential oil obtained from the leaves of the same species [

 <xref rid="B31-antibiotics-09-00247" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], safrole is a bioactive compound widely used in the food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries. In general, essential oils present significant yield, and their composition can vary depending on climatic and environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity, precipitation, soil, and time of collection. Additionally, the part of the plant used (leaves, bark, seeds or root), as well as the method of the extraction, may interfere with the composition of the essential oil of a given species [
