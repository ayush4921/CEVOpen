<p>According to Nazzaro et al. [
 <xref rid="B34-antibiotics-09-00247" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], Gram-negative bacteria are more resistant to the penetration of essential oils due to the presence of an outer layer of lipopolysaccharides. Accordingly, Betim et al. [
 <xref rid="B35-antibiotics-09-00247" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], comparing the antibacterial activities of 
 <italic>O. odorífera</italic> and 
 <italic>O. nutans</italic>, demonstrated that the essential oil of 
 <italic>O. odorífera</italic> presented more potent effects. In addition, they found that both essential oils were more effective against Gram-positive bacteria, corroborating the findings of the present research. On the other hand, a study by Damascemo et al. [
 <xref rid="B36-antibiotics-09-00247" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] found clinically ineffective MIC values for the essential oil of 
 <italic>O. bicolor</italic> against 
 <italic>S. aureus, P. aeruginosa</italic>, and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. Furthermore, Cansian et al. [
 <xref rid="B37-antibiotics-09-00247" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] found that an essential oil obtained from 
 <italic>O. odorifera</italic> was more efficient against Gram-negative bacteria. As discussed above, the chemical composition of a species may be significantly influenced by several environmental factors, which may affect the pharmacological effects of extracts, fractions, and essential oils.
