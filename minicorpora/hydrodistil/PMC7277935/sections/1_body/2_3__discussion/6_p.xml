<p>Efflux pumps are membrane proteins that carry out the active transport of a wide range of molecules, removing potentially toxic substances from the intracellular medium. However, in the context of antibiotic therapy, the active transport of drugs by these proteins results in reduced intracellular concentrations and, consequently, failure in the therapeutic effect [
 <xref rid="B23-antibiotics-09-00247" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Increasing evidence has demonstrated that efflux pumps are overexpressed in multiresistant bacterial strains, such as methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA). Thus, considering the notable role of efflux pumps on antibacterial resistance in 
 <italic>S. aureus,</italic> we evaluated the potential involvement of EP inhibition on safrole-mediated antibiotic resistance modulation in the 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> 1199B and K2068 strains, which express the NorA and MepA EP, respectively. In the present study, the association with subinhibitory concentrations of safrole or chlorpromazine (control drug) significantly reduced the MIC of ethidium bromide against both strains. According to Tintino et al. [
 <xref rid="B39-antibiotics-09-00247" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], when natural or synthetic compounds are tested against EP-bearing strains in association with ethidium bromide, a reduction in the MIC of this substance indicates that the tested compound also acts as an EP inhibitor. Thus, it is suggested that safrole could serve as an EP inhibitor in these 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains.
