<p>The discovery of penicillin represented an important milestone in the therapy of bacterial diseases and opened new perspectives for antibacterial drug development. Additionally, the introduction of the last generation of antibiotics has had a significant impact on public health, contributing to reduced morbidity and mortality rates caused by bacterial infections. However, the irrational use of this therapeutic classes has contributed to the selection of multidrug-resistant bacterial strains, against which conventional antibiotics may become ineffective.
