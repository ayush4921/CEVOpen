<p>Accordingly, Oliveira-Tintino et al. [
 <xref rid="B40-antibiotics-09-00247" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] reported that while the essential oil of 
 <italic>Chenopodium ambrosioides</italic> significantly reduced the MIC of ethidium bromide against the 1199B strain, its principal constituent Î±-Terpinene presented no significant modulating effect, suggesting that other components of the 
 <italic>C. ambrosioides</italic> oil could act as EP inhibitors. However, the molecular mechanisms associated with EP inhibition by essential oils, as well as their isolated components, remain to be fully characterized. Nevertheless, since ethidium bromide is used as a substrate by bacterial EP, it is hypothesized that these natural products could act by blocking the binding of the substrate to the pump. Additionally, it has been suggested that energy depletion, competition with ATP, and interference with the proton gradient are potential mechanisms associated with EP inhibition by natural or synthetic compounds [
