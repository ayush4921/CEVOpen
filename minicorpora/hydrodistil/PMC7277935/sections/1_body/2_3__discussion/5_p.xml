<p>Following the antibacterial activity analysis, this work investigated the ability of the EOOO and safrole ability to modulate the antibacterial resistance to norfloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic. The MIC values of norfloxacin against strains of 
 <italic>S. aureus, P. aeruginosa</italic>, and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> were significantly reduced in the presence of a subinhibitory concentration of the EOOO and safrole (MIC รท 8) indicating that both the oil and the isolated compound can modulate the antibacterial resistance to norfloxacin observed for the Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains evaluated by our study. Nevertheless, the isolated compound showed more potent antibiotic-enhancing activity against all strains, reducing the MIC of norfloxacin by up to 7 fold in comparison with the antibiotic alone. Studies have demonstrated that antibacterial resistance to norfloxacin is significantly mediated by the expression of efflux systems [
