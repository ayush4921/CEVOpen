<p>Considering the promising effects demonstrated by safrole in the efflux pump inhibition assay, it was evaluated whether safrole could modulate bacterial resistance 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains bearing resistance genes against norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. The results of the present study demonstrated that safrole, as well as the EP inhibitor chlorpromazine (control), significantly reduced the MICs of both antibiotics, suggesting that the resistance to these drugs was, at least partially, reverted by safrole, which possibly inhibits the NorA- and MepA-mediated efflux mechanisms in 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> [

 <xref rid="B43-antibiotics-09-00247" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. To confirm this hypothesis, molecular modeling and docking analysis were used to evaluate in silico, the potential interactions between safrole or chlorpromazine (control drug) and the NorA and MepA efflux pumps. The present findings suggest that safrole, as well as chlorpromazine, could act as efflux pump inhibitors in the 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> SA1119B and K2068 strains, and that safrole has a more favorable interaction with the MepA protein compared to NorA.
