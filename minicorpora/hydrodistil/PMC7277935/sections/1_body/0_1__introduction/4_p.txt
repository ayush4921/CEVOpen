0: Aiming to discover new weapons to combat bacterial resistance, researchers have been dedicated to investigating the antibacterial and antibiotic-modulating properties of natural products.
1: Therefore, considering the evidence that essential oils and safrole could modulate bacterial growth in different resistant strains, this study aims to characterize the phytochemical profile and evaluate the antibacterial and antibiotic-modulating properties of the essential oil of  Ocotea odoriferas and safrole in EP-carrying strains.
