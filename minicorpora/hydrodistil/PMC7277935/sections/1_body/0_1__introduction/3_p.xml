 <italic>S. aureus</italic> is a Gram-positive bacterium with remarkable pathogenicity. Accordingly, resistance to antibiotics is currently a major worldwide public health problem [
 <xref rid="B21-antibiotics-09-00247" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Resistant bacteria are characterized by the presence of natural or acquired mechanisms that confer survivability even in the presence of high concentrations of antibiotics [
 <xref rid="B22-antibiotics-09-00247" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In this context, genetic modification of the binding site, enzymatic inactivation, and active transport by efflux pumps (EPs) are recognized as the principal mechanisms of resistance to antibiotics [
 <xref rid="B23-antibiotics-09-00247" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Importantly, EPs were found to mediate antibiotic resistance in several strains of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. By actively transporting drugs to the extracellular medium, these transmembrane proteins reduce the intracellular concentrations of antibiotics, resulting in ineffective therapy [
