0: S. aureus is a Gram-positive bacterium with remarkable pathogenicity.
1: Accordingly, resistance to antibiotics is currently a major worldwide public health problem [ 21].
2: Resistant bacteria are characterized by the presence of natural or acquired mechanisms that confer survivability even in the presence of high concentrations of antibiotics [ 22].
3: In this context, genetic modification of the binding site, enzymatic inactivation, and active transport by efflux pumps (EPs) are recognized as the principal mechanisms of resistance to antibiotics [ 23].
4: Importantly, EPs were found to mediate antibiotic resistance in several strains of  S. aureus.
5: By actively transporting drugs to the extracellular medium, these transmembrane proteins reduce the intracellular concentrations of antibiotics, resulting in ineffective therapy [ 24].
