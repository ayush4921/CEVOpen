 <italic>Ocotea odorífera</italic> (Lauraceae) is a plant popularly known as “sassafras”. This species, native to Brazil, is widely found in the Atlantic Forest where is used by the local communities in the treatment of malaria and rheumatism. In addition, due to its remarkable chemical constitution and abundance of essential oils, this plant has been used as a source of flavoring agents in the food industry [
