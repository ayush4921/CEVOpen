0: Compounds generated by the secondary metabolism of plants constitute a large group of substances with significant structural and functional diversity, among which essential oils are notable bioactive compounds with antifungal, antiviral, antiprotozoal and antibacterial properties [ 1, 2, 3, 4].
1: Essential oils are complex mixtures of volatile and aromatic compounds found in a great variety of plant species, acting in defense against infections, parasites, and other stress conditions [ 5, 6].
2: In this context, terpenes, which comprise the largest class of natural products, have been identified as very potent bioactive compounds [ 7].
3: Thymol and carvacrol are notable compounds with potent antimicrobial activities.
4: These monoterpenes have been found as major constituents of essential oils obtained from a wide variety of aromatic plants [ 8].
5: Accordingly, the essential oil of the leaves of Aloysia gratissima and Baccharis reticulata, which have 1,8-cineole, germacrene D, -pinene, -caryophyllene, and  -pinene as major constituents, demonstrated bactericidal activity against both Gram-positive ( Staphylococcus aureus and  Bacillus cereus) and Gram-negative ( Escherichia coli and  Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacterial strains [ 9, 10].
