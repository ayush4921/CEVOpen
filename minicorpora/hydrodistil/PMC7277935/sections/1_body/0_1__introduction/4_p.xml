<p>Aiming to discover new weapons to combat bacterial resistance, researchers have been dedicated to investigating the antibacterial and antibiotic-modulating properties of natural products. Therefore, considering the evidence that essential oils and safrole could modulate bacterial growth in different resistant strains, this study aims to characterize the phytochemical profile and evaluate the antibacterial and antibiotic-modulating properties of the essential oil of 
 <italic>Ocotea odoriferas</italic> and safrole in EP-carrying strains.
