0: Ocotea odorifera (Lauraceae) is a plant popularly known as sassafras.
1: This species, native to Brazil, is widely found in the Atlantic Forest where is used by the local communities in the treatment of malaria and rheumatism.
2: In addition, due to its remarkable chemical constitution and abundance of essential oils, this plant has been used as a source of flavoring agents in the food industry [ 11, 12, 13].
3: Previous research with the essential oil of  O. odorifera (EOOO) has identified safrole (C 10H 10O 2) as a major constituent, with unique chemical and pharmacological properties [ 14, 15, 16].
4: Accordingly, safrole has been used in the production of fragrances and as a raw material in the synthesis of drugs and insecticides [ 17].
5: While the effects of essential oils containing safrole against Gram-negative strains of  Escherichia coli, Salmonella thyphimurium, and  Pseudomonas aeruginosa, have been demonstrated previously, the antibacterial activity of this organic compound against  Staphylococcus aureus strains remains to be characterized [ 18, 19, 20].
