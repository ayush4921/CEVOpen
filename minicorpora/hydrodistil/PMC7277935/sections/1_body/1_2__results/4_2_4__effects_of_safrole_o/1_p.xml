<p>The ethidium bromide assay has been widely used to evaluate the potential action of drugs as EP inhibitors [
 <xref rid="B25-antibiotics-09-00247" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Therefore, it was evaluated whether safrole could modulate bacterial resistance in the 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> 1199B and K2068 strains, which express the NorA and MepA EP, respectively. The association with subinhibitory concentrations of safrole or chlorpromazine (control drug) significantly reduced the MIC of ethidium bromide against both strains, indicating that safrole could act as an EP inhibitor in some 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains (
