<p>Following the promising effects demonstrated by safrole in the ethidium bromide test, the effects of this compound as a modulator of bacterial resistance in association with norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin was investigated. Of note, the 1199B and K2068 strains, respectively, bear resistance genes against each of these antibiotics. To this end, the MIC of this antibiotic was calculated after culturing the same bacterial strains in the presence or absence of the natural products at concentrations equivalent to their MIC รท 8. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-09-00247-f003">Figure 3</xref>, the association with safrole or chlorpromazine (control) significantly reduced the MICs of both antibiotics, suggesting that the resistance to these drugs was, at least partially, reverted by safrole, which possibly inhibits the NorA and MepA-mediated efflux mechanisms in
