<p>As the EOOO and safrole presented variable intrinsic antibacterial activity, this study analyzed the ability of these substances to modulate the antibacterial resistance to norfloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic. To this end, the MIC of this antibiotic was calculated after culturing the same bacterial strains in the presence or absence of the natural products at concentrations equivalent to their MIC รท 8. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-09-00247-f001">Figure 1</xref>, The MIC values of norfloxacin against strains of 
 <italic>S. aureus, P. aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> were significantly reduced by both EOOO and safrole, indicating that they present antibiotic-modulating effects against all investigated strains. Interestingly, while these treatments did not present direct antibacterial effects against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, they were found to modulate the antibacterial resistance to norfloxacin observed for the Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains evaluated by the present study.
