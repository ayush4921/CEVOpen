<p>The broth dilution method was used to determine the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of the essential oil of 
 <italic>Ocotea odorifera</italic> and its major constituent safrole against multi-resistant strains of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. The antibacterial activity analysis revealed that both treatments presented MIC values above 1024 μg/mL against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, indicating that they exert clinically ineffective antibacterial activity against these strains. However, both treatments presented MIC values of 512 μg/mL against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, suggesting that 
 <italic>O. odorifera</italic> and its major constituent safrole exert antibacterial effects against this Gram-positive strain (
