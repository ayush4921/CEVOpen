 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-09-00247-f004">Figure 4</xref>B) in the binding pockets of the NorA (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-09-00247-f004">Figure 4</xref>D) efflux pumps. Interaction maps were used to predict the participation of amino acid residues in the binding of chlorpromazine (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-09-00247-f004">Figure 4</xref>E,F) or safrole (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-09-00247-f004">Figure 4</xref>G,H) to these efflux pumps. The interaction maps show that chlorpromazine and safrole similarly interact with the MepA binding site through anchors with Glu287, Leu366, Met363, Met341 Pro286, Val283, Leu282, and Val334, as well as with the NorA binding site through Gly342, Val286, Ile258, Ala261, Ile341, Ala339, Leu325, and Phe283. The interactions between these amino acids and safrole are given at nonpolar and partially hydrophobic regions involving Van der Waals, π-Allyl, and Allyl interactions. On the other hand, the binding of chlorpromazine to the corresponding amino acids predominantly involves Van der Waals, π-Allyl, Allyl, carbon hydrogen bond, π-π, π-sigma, and π-sulfur interactions. These findings corroborate the evidence that safrole, as well as chlorpromazine, could act as efflux pump inhibitors in the
