<p>The docking simulations determined the ligand-bound protein complexes with minimal energy and the best stability. The best-docked ligand conformations were saved in output clusters 0. The docking studies revealed that chlorpromazine and safrole presented the most favorable interaction energies (IE), which were positively correlated with their MIC values, inhibition constants (Ki) and size-independent ligand efficiency (SILE) for both NorA (
