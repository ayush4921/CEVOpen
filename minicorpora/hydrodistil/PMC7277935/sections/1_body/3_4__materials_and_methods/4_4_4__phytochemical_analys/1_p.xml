<p>The chemical composition of the essential oil was determined by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (CG-EM) using an Agilent 6890 chromatograph (Palo Alto, CA, USA) coupled to an Agilent 5973N mass selection detector. The separation of the constituents was obtained in a capillary column HP-5MS (5%-phenyl-95%-dimethylpolysiloxane, 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) and using helium as the carrier gas (1.0 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup>). The chemical constituents were identified by comparing their mass spectra with the standards reported in the literature [
