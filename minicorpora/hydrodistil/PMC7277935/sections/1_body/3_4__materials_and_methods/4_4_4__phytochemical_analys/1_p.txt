0: The chemical composition of the essential oil was determined by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (CG-EM) using an Agilent 6890 chromatograph (Palo Alto, CA, USA) coupled to an Agilent 5973N mass selection detector.
1: The separation of the constituents was obtained in a capillary column HP-5MS (5%-phenyl-95%-dimethylpolysiloxane, 30 m  0.25 mm  0.25 m) and using helium as the carrier gas (1.0 mL min 1).
2: The chemical constituents were identified by comparing their mass spectra with the standards reported in the literature [ 49].
