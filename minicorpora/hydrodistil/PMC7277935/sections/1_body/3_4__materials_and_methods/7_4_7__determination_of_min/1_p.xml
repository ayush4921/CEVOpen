<p>Each inoculum was prepared with 10% Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) at a ratio of 1:9. Next, 100 µL of inoculum in medium was placed in wells on a 96-well plate with 100 µL of the substance at concentrations ranging from 1024 to 8 µg/mL, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 24 h. Positive controls (medium + inoculum) were included in the last wells of the plate [

After incubation, 20 µL of sodium resazurin was added to each well, followed by an additional 1 h incubation period at room temperature. A change in the color of the solution, due to the reduction of resazurin, was used as an indicator of bacterial growth [
