0: Each inoculum was prepared with 10% Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) at a ratio of 1:9.
1: Next, 100 L of inoculum in medium was placed in wells on a 96-well plate with 100 L of the substance at concentrations ranging from 1024 to 8 g/mL, followed by incubation at 37 C for 24 h. Positive controls (medium + inoculum) were included in the last wells of the plate [ 50].
2: After incubation, 20 L of sodium resazurin was added to each well, followed by an additional 1 h incubation period at room temperature.
3: A change in the color of the solution, due to the reduction of resazurin, was used as an indicator of bacterial growth [ 51, 52].
4: The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration capable of inhibiting bacterial growth.
5: All experiments were carried out in triplicate for all bacterial strains.
