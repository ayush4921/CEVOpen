0: Docking simulations were carried out with a binding region defined by a 10 A  10 A  10 A box set at the centroid of predicted ligand-binding sites.
1: The structures were adjusted using a protein preparation tool provided by the Chimera package (version 1.14, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA), the 3D structures of ligands were obtained using the corina  3D structure generator (version 4.3, Altamira LLC, Oklahoma city, OK, USA), and minimization of energy was achieved using the UCSF Chimera structure build module [ 57].
2: The docking analyses were carried out using the UCSF Chimera and AutoDock Vina software (version 1.1.2., The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA, USA) based on the iterated local search global optimizer [ 58].
3: Proteins and ligands were maintained flexible during the docking process.
4: The selection of flexible residues from proteins was based on the active site at 4.0 A from the co-crystallized ligands.
5: The most favorable binding free energy was represented by clustering the positional Root-mean-square deviation of atomic positions (RMSD) data with no more than 1.0 A.
6: The final docked complexes were analyzed using the Discovery Studio visualizer program version 3.1 (Dassault Systemes, San Diego, CA, USA).
7: The binding energy score was used to calculate the inhibition constant (Ki value)-based in an equation by Onawole et al.
8: [ 59], and the size-independent ligand efficiency (SILE) was measured using the equation described by Nissink, J. W. M. [ 60].
