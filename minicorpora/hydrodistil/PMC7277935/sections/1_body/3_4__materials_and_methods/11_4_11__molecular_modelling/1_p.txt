0: The three-dimensional (3D) structures of the NoRA and MepA proteins were determined using homology models as follows: the three-dimensional structures were predicted using the Protein Homology/Analogy Recognition Engine version 2.0 (Phyre2, available  http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/phyre2) web server, and confirmed using the Iterative Threading Assembly Refinement (I-TASSER, available  http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/I-TASSER/) and MODELLER 9.14 servers.
1: The stereochemical quality of the protein structures was checked by the Ramachandran plot using the PROCHECK program [ 55].
2: The topographic structure of the pockets and cavities were characterized using the Computed Atlas of Surface Topography of proteins (CASTp, available  http://cast.engr.uic.edu) with a standard value of 1.4 A of the radius, and the ligand-binding sites were predicted using the 3DligandSite server [ 56].
