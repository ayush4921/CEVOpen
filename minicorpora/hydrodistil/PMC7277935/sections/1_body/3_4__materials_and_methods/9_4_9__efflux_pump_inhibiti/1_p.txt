0: In this test, the MIC of ethidium bromide was determined in the presence or absence of sub-inhibitory concentrations of the EOOO and safrole.
1: Briefly, the bacterial inocula were prepared in BHI medium, and the treatments were added at concentrations equivalent to their MIC  8.
2: Wells on a 96-well plate were filled with 100 L of the solutions of each treatment and then, ethidium bromide was added to the wells at concentrations ranging from 1024 to 0.5 g/mL.
3: A reduction in the ethidium bromide MIC was interpreted as EP inhibition [ 54].
4: Experimental controls and MIC values for both OEOC and safrole were determined as described above.
5: All tests were performed in triplicate.
