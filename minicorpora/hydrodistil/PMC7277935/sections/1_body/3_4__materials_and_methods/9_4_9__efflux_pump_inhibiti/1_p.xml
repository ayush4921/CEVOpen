<p>In this test, the MIC of ethidium bromide was determined in the presence or absence of sub-inhibitory concentrations of the EOOO and safrole. Briefly, the bacterial inocula were prepared in BHI medium, and the treatments were added at concentrations equivalent to their MIC ÷ 8. Wells on a 96-well plate were filled with 100 µL of the solutions of each treatment and then, ethidium bromide was added to the wells at concentrations ranging from 1024 to 0.5 µg/mL. A reduction in the ethidium bromide MIC was interpreted as EP inhibition [
