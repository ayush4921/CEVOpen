 <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains 1199B and K2068, which carry the NorA and MepA efflux proteins, respectively, were kindly provided by Prof. S. Gibbons (University of London). All strains were initially kept on blood agar (Laboratorios Difco Ltd.a., São Paulo, Brazil) and maintained in Heart Infusion Agar (HIA, Difco) medium at 4 °C. Samples were transferred from the solid medium to test tubes containing sterile saline, and turbidity was assessed using a value of 0.5 on the McFarland scale, corresponding to 10
 <sup>5</sup> CFU.
