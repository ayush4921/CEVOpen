0: S. aureus strains 1199B and K2068, which carry the NorA and MepA efflux proteins, respectively, were kindly provided by Prof. S. Gibbons (University of London).
1: All strains were initially kept on blood agar (Laboratorios Difco Ltd.a., Sao Paulo, Brazil) and maintained in Heart Infusion Agar (HIA, Difco) medium at 4 C. Samples were transferred from the solid medium to test tubes containing sterile saline, and turbidity was assessed using a value of 0.5 on the McFarland scale, corresponding to 10 5 CFU.
