0: Considering that the  S. aureus strains 1199B and K2068 carry genes encoding efflux proteins associated with antibiotic resistance to norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin, respectively, this protocol was used to evaluate the ability of the EOOO and safrole to modulate bacterial resistance in association with these antibiotics against the corresponding strain.
1: The bacterial inocula were prepared in BHI medium and the treatments were added at concentrations equivalent to their MIC  8.
2: Wells on a 96-well plate were filled with 100 L of the solutions of each treatment and then, each antibiotic was added to the wells at concentrations ranging from 1024 to 0.5 g/mL.
3: A reduction in the MIC of the antibiotic was interpreted as EP inhibition [ 54].
4: Experimental controls and MIC values for both EOOO and safrole were determined as described above.
5: All tests were performed in triplicate.
