<p>The essential oil of 
 <italic>Ocotea odorifera</italic> has antibacterial and antibiotic-enhancing activities that are, at least partially, mediated by its major constituent, safrole. Safrole modulates antibiotic resistance in the 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> SA1119B and K2068 strains, possibly through direct inhibition of the NorA and MepA efflux pumps, respectively.
