0: The chemical composition of  S. rosmarinus essential oils was screened by gas chromatography associated with mass spectrometry, using a Hewlett-Packard gas chromatograph (Agilent, Milan, Italy) equipped with a non-polar HP-5 capillary column (30 m  0.25 mm, 0.25 m), associated with a Hewlett-Packard mass spectrometer (Agilent, Milan, Italy).
1: The ionization of the sample constituents was performed in electronic impact (EI, 70 electronvolt).
2: The analyses were carried out with the following temperature schedule: Isotherm at 50 C for 5 min, temperature increase from 50 to 250 C of 5 C/min, and finally isotherm at 250 C for 10 min.
3: Helium was used as carrier gas (1.0 mL/min).
4: One L of diluted essential oil (1/10 v/v, in  n-hexane) was injected (split ratio 1:20).
5: Essential oils were also analyzed using a Shimadzu GC17A gas chromatograph, equipped with an ionization flame detector (FID) and an HP-5 capillary column (30 m  0.25 mm, 0.25 m) (Shimadzu, Milan, Italy).
6: Nitrogen was used as transport gas.
7: The conditions used were the same as those described for the GC-MS analyses.
8: Retention index were determined in relation to a homologous series of  n-alkanes (C 8-C 24) under the same operating conditions.
