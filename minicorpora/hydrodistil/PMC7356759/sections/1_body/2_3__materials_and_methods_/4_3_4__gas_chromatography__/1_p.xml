<p>The chemical composition of 
 <italic>S. rosmarinus</italic> essential oils was screened by gas chromatography associated with mass spectrometry, using a Hewlett-Packard gas chromatograph (Agilent, Milan, Italy) equipped with a non-polar HP-5 capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm), associated with a Hewlett-Packard mass spectrometer (Agilent, Milan, Italy). The ionization of the sample constituents was performed in electronic impact (EI, 70 electronvolt). The analyses were carried out with the following temperature schedule: Isotherm at 50 °C for 5 min, temperature increase from 50 to 250 °C of 5 °C/min, and finally isotherm at 250 °C for 10 min. Helium was used as carrier gas (1.0 mL/min). One μL of diluted essential oil (1/10 v/v, in 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane) was injected (split ratio 1:20). Essential oils were also analyzed using a Shimadzu GC17A gas chromatograph, equipped with an ionization flame detector (FID) and an HP-5 capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm) (Shimadzu, Milan, Italy). Nitrogen was used as transport gas. The conditions used were the same as those described for the GC-MS analyses. Retention index were determined in relation to a homologous series of 
 <italic>n</italic>-alkanes (C
 <sub>8</sub>-C
 <sub>24</sub>) under the same operating conditions.
