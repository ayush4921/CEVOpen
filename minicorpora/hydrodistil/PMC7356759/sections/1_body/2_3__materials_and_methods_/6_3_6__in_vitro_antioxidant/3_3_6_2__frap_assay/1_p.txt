0: The ability to reduce iron ions was assessed using FRAP test [ 58].
1: A solution of tripyridyltriazine (TPTZ, 10 mM), 2.5 mL of FeCl 30 (20 mM), HCl (40 mM), and 25 mL of acetate buffer (0.3 M) at pH 3.6 was prepared in order to obtain FRAP reagent.
2: The latter (2.0 mL), water (900 L), and essential oil (100 L) at a concentration of 2.5 mg/mL were mixed.
3: After 30 min of incubation, the absorbance was measured at 595 nm.
4: Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) was used as a positive control.
5: The FRAP value was expressed as M Fe (II)/g.
