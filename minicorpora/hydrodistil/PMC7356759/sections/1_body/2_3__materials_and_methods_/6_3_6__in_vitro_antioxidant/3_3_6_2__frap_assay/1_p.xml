<p>The ability to reduce iron ions was assessed using FRAP test [
 <xref rid="B58-plants-09-00798" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. A solution of tripyridyltriazine (TPTZ, 10 mM), 2.5 mL of FeCl
 <sub>30</sub> (20 mM), HCl (40 mM), and 25 mL of acetate buffer (0.3 M) at pH 3.6 was prepared in order to obtain FRAP reagent. The latter (2.0 mL), water (900 μL), and essential oil (100 μL) at a concentration of 2.5 mg/mL were mixed. After 30 min of incubation, the absorbance was measured at 595 nm. Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) was used as a positive control. The FRAP value was expressed as μM Fe (II)/g.
