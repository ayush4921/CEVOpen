0: The ability of rosemary essential oils to protect lipid peroxidation was assessed by using the -carotene bleaching test [ 59].
1: Propyl gallate was the positive control.
2: In brief, a mixture of -carotene, linoleic acid, and 100% Tween 20 was prepared.
3: The obtained emulsion was added to a 96-well microplate containing sample at concentrations ranging from 100 to 2.5 g/mL.
4: The absorbance was measured at 470 nm against a blank at t = 0 and after 30 and 60 min of incubation.
5: The antioxidant activity was calculated as follows: AA = [(A 0  A t) /(A 0*  A t*)]  100, where A 0 and A 0* are the absorbance values obtained at the time 0 for samples and control, respectively, while A t and A t* are the absorbance values obtained after 30 and 60 min of incubation for samples and control, respectively.
