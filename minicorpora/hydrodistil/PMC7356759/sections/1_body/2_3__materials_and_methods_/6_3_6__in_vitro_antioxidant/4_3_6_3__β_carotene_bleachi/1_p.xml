<p>The ability of rosemary essential oils to protect lipid peroxidation was assessed by using the β-carotene bleaching test [
 <xref rid="B59-plants-09-00798" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Propyl gallate was the positive control. In brief, a mixture of β-carotene, linoleic acid, and 100% Tween 20 was prepared. The obtained emulsion was added to a 96-well microplate containing sample at concentrations ranging from 100 to 2.5 μg/mL. The absorbance was measured at 470 nm against a blank at t = 0 and after 30 and 60 min of incubation. The antioxidant activity was calculated as follows: AA = [(A
 <sub>0</sub> − A
 <sub>t</sub>) /(A
 <sub>0</sub>* − A
 <sub>t</sub>*)] × 100, where A
 <sub>0</sub> and A
 <sub>0</sub>* are the absorbance values obtained at the time 0 for samples and control, respectively, while A
 <sub>t</sub> and A
 <sub>t</sub>* are the absorbance values obtained after 30 and 60 min of incubation for samples and control, respectively.
