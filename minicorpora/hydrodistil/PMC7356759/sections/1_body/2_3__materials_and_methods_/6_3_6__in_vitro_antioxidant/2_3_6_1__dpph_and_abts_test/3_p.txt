0: The DPPH radicals scavenging activity was calculated by using the following equation: DPPH radicals scavenging activity (%) = [1  (sample absorbance with DPPH  sample absorbance without DPPH)]  100.
1: ABTS test was employed following the procedure previously used by [ 59].
2: ABTS solution (7 mM) and potassium persulphate (2.45 mM) were mixed in order to obtain ABTS radical cation solution (ABTS +).
3: After 12 h, ABTS + was diluted with ethanol to final absorbance of 0.70 at 734 nm.
4: Successively, 2 mL of diluted ABTS + solution was added to extracts (25 L) at concentrations (1400 g/mL).
5: After 6 min the absorbance was read at 734 nm.
6: The ABTS scavenging capacity was calculated following the equation: ABTS radicals scavenging activity (%) = [(A 0  A)/A 0]  100, where A 0 is the absorbance of the control reaction and A is the absorbance in the presence of extract.
