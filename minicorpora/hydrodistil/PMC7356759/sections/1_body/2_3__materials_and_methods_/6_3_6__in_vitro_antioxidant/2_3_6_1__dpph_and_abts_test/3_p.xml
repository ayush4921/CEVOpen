<p>The DPPH radicals’ scavenging activity was calculated by using the following equation: DPPH radicals’ scavenging activity (%) = [1 − (sample absorbance with DPPH − sample absorbance without DPPH)] × 100. ABTS test was employed following the procedure previously used by [
 <xref rid="B59-plants-09-00798" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. ABTS solution (7 mM) and potassium persulphate (2.45 mM) were mixed in order to obtain ABTS radical cation solution (ABTS
 <sup>+</sup>). After 12 h, ABTS
 <sup>+</sup> was diluted with ethanol to final absorbance of 0.70 at 734 nm. Successively, 2 mL of diluted ABTS
 <sup>+</sup> solution was added to extracts (25 μL) at concentrations (1–400 μg/mL). After 6 min the absorbance was read at 734 nm. The ABTS scavenging capacity was calculated following the equation: ABTS radicals’ scavenging activity (%) = [(A
 <sub>0</sub> − A)/A
 <sub>0</sub>] × 100, where A
 <sub>0</sub> is the absorbance of the control reaction and A is the absorbance in the presence of extract.
