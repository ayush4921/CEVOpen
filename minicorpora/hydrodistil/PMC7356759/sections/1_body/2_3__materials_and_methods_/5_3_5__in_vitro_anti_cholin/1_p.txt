0: The inhibition of AChE and BChE enzymes was measured by using a modified colorimetric Ellmans method [ 20] based on the reaction of released thiocholine to give a colored product with a chromogenic reagent such as AChE from  E. electricus (EC 3.1.1.7, Type VI-S) and BChE equine serum (EC 3.1.1.8).
1: Acetylthiocholine (ATCI) iodide and butyrylthiocholine iodide (BTCI) were employed as the substrates of the reaction.
2: In brief, enzyme, essential oils, and phosphate buffer were mixed in microplates and incubated in an ice bath at 4 C. After 30 min, physostigmine was added.
3: The reaction started by adding 5,5-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic-acid) (DTNB) solution and substrate.
4: The microplate was placed in a thermostatic water bath (Branson model 3800-CPXH, Milan, Italy) for 20 min at 37 C. The reaction was stopped by placing the microplate in an ice bath and adding physostigmine.
5: The absorbance was measured at 405 nm.
6: The percentage inhibition was calculated by the equation:
