<p>The inhibition of AChE and BChE enzymes was measured by using a modified colorimetric Ellman’s method [
 <xref rid="B20-plants-09-00798" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] based on the reaction of released thiocholine to give a colored product with a chromogenic reagent such as AChE from 
 <italic>E. electricus</italic> (EC 3.1.1.7, Type VI-S) and BChE equine serum (EC 3.1.1.8). Acetylthiocholine (ATCI) iodide and butyrylthiocholine iodide (BTCI) were employed as the substrates of the reaction. In brief, enzyme, essential oils, and phosphate buffer were mixed in microplates and incubated in an ice bath at 4 °C. After 30 min, physostigmine was added. The reaction started by adding 5,5’-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic-acid) (DTNB) solution and substrate. The microplate was placed in a thermostatic water bath (Branson model 3800-CPXH, Milan, Italy) for 20 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by placing the microplate in an ice bath and adding physostigmine. The absorbance was measured at 405 nm. The percentage inhibition was calculated by the equation:
