 <italic>S. rosmarinus</italic> were collected in Calabria (Southern Italy) in Cirò Marina, Ionian coast [R1 (Crotone, latitude: 39°22′43″ N, longitude: 17°01′52″ E, 360 m above the sea), voucher specimen n. CLU 23969], and in Praia a Mare, Tyrrhenian coast [R2 (Cosenza, latitude: 39°52′14″ N, longitude: 15°47′26″ E, 30 m above the sea), voucher specimen n. CLU 23974]. Both sites are characterized by a Mediterranean climate. However, the R1 site results with a dry-thermo-Mediterranean bioclimate, whereas in the R2 site the bioclimate is sub humid-meso-Mediterranean. Plants of rosemary grow in a shrubby habitat with an open canopy structure and some bare ground (garrigue) on a rocky limestone soil.
