<p>All experiments were performed in triplicate (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3). Data are expressed as means ± standard deviation (SD). The concentration giving 50% inhibition (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) was calculated by nonlinear regression with the use of Prism GraphPad Prism version 4.0 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). The concentration-response curve was obtained by plotting the percentage inhibition versus concentration. Differences within and between groups were evaluated by one-way analysis of variance test (ANOVA) followed by a multi-comparison Dunnett’s test that was used to compare each group with the positive control in biological assays. Differences were considered to be significant at
