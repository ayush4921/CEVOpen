0: All experiments were performed in triplicate ( n = 3).
1: Data are expressed as means  standard deviation (SD).
2: The concentration giving 50% inhibition (IC 50) was calculated by nonlinear regression with the use of Prism GraphPad Prism version 4.0 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).
3: The concentration-response curve was obtained by plotting the percentage inhibition versus concentration.
4: Differences within and between groups were evaluated by one-way analysis of variance test (ANOVA) followed by a multi-comparison Dunnetts test that was used to compare each group with the positive control in biological assays.
5: Differences were considered to be significant at  p< 0.05 in the biological test.
6: Relative antioxidant capacity index (RACI) is an integrated statistical application to analyse the antioxidant capacity values generated by different in vitro methods [ 60].
