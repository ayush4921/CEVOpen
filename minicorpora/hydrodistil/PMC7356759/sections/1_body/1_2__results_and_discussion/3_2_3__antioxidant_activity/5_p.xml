<p>Our results differed from those recently reported by Chraibi et al. [
 <xref rid="B46-plants-09-00798" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] who analysed the radical scavenging power against DPPH of 
 <italic>S. rosmarinus</italic> essential oil from Morocco and found a better activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 2.77 mg/mL. El Kamli et al. [
 <xref rid="B47-plants-09-00798" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] reported the potential of Moroccan rosemary essential oils to inhibit lipid peroxidation. However, all samples demonstrated less antioxidant capacity compared to our samples, showing IC
 <sub>50</sub> values in the range of 18.12–24.23 mg/mL. Previously, Bouyahya et al. [
 <xref rid="B48-plants-09-00798" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] assessed the antioxidant activity of Moroccan 
 <italic>S. rosmarinus</italic> essential oils but, in comparison with our results, this essential oil showed major activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 85.74 and 523.41 μg/mL, respectively, for FRAP and DPPH test. The antioxidant ability of essential oils obtained from seven Iranian populations of 
 <italic>S. rosmarinus</italic> was analysed, finding lower inhibition percentages ranging from 28.73–73.69%, tested at concentration of 3.6 mg/mL in DPPH test [
