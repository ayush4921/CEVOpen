<p>Literature data evidenced a correlation between oxidative stress and degenerative diseases. Indeed, the oxidative stress is a key hallmark of generation and accumulation of ROS that promote neuronal cell death [

Iron-induced oxidative stress, as evidenced by iron accumulation in the brain of AD, is responsible for neurodegeneration in patients diagnosed with AD. This iron accumulation in the brain of AD patients leads to the formation of hydroxyl radicals through the Fenton reaction [
