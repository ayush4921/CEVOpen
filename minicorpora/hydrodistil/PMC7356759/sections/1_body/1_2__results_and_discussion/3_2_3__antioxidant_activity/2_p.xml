<p>Herein, in order to estimate the antioxidant potential effects, 
 <italic>S. rosmarinus</italic> essential oils were investigated by using different in vitro assays, namely 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), ferric reducing ability power (FRAP), and β-carotene bleaching test (
