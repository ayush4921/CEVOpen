<p>Nie et al. [
 <xref rid="B55-plants-09-00798" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] evaluated the radical scavenging activity of active compounds of rosemary essential oil in DPPH and ABTS test. In the first test, the active order was camphor &gt; bornyl acetate &gt; 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene &gt; 3-carene &gt; 
 <italic>o</italic>-cymene &gt; α-pinene &gt; terpinen-4-ol &gt; camphene &gt; linalool oxide acetate &gt; β-pinene &gt; α-bisabolene. The authors suggested that the carbonyl group is important to free radical scavenging activity and the presence of a double bond conjugated to a carbonyl group will further enhance the antioxidant activity. In ABTS test, the active order was 
 <italic>o</italic>-cymene &gt; camphene &gt; α-pinene &gt; camphor &gt; bornyl acetate &gt; α-bisabolene. It was observed that camphor and bornyl acetate showed strong activity in scavenging DPPH radical but less activity against ABTS radical cation due to different kinds of free radicals and the way antioxidants interact with free radicals. Indeed, both affected the scavenging effect of antioxidants. In this case, the cyclic ether group was particularly important for ABTS radical cation scavenging. Thus, the antioxidant activity was correlated to essential oil composition and, consequently, to oxygenated monoterpenes and mixture of mono- and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons [

 <xref rid="B49-plants-09-00798" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], the antioxidant activity was positively correlated with the most abundant compounds, such as β-pinene or 1,8-cineole. In a previous study, 1,8-cineole and α-pinene demonstrated to prevent lipid peroxidation [

The higher lipophilic character of this monoterpene drives strong interactions with cell membranes. Interestingly, α-pinene and 1,8-cineole increased the activity and protein expression of the main antioxidant enzymes including catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and superoxide dismutase. However, it is important to know that minor compounds may act in synergism with the most abundant compounds.
