<p>Previously, Kadri et al. [
 <xref rid="B53-plants-09-00798" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] screened the 
 <italic>S. rosmarinus</italic> essential oil from Tunisia for its in vitro antioxidant activities using DPPH, β-carotene bleaching test, and FRAP assay. The results of the DPPH assay showed an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 110.20 μg/mL, better than our results. In the β-carotene bleaching test, Tunisian essential oil showed a higher inhibition of lipid peroxidation (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 27.28 μg/mL). The half maximal effective concentration (EC
 <sub>50</sub>) (concentration at which the absorbance is 0.5) value of 
 <italic>S. rosmarinus</italic> essential oil was 38.68 μg/mL. Interestingly, Hussain et al. [
 <xref rid="B54-plants-09-00798" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] reported that essential oil of 
 <italic>S. rosmarinus</italic>, cultivated in Pakistan, showed strong antioxidant activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 20.9 μg/mL).
