<p>In DPPH test, R1 sample exhibited a greater radicals’ scavenging activity with a percentage of 33.21%. Conversely, the ABTS
 <sup>+</sup> radical cation was more sensible to R2 oil that showed an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 22.61 μg/mL. This evidence can be justified because ABTS
 <sup>+</sup> and DPPH radicals possessed a different stereochemistry and a different training mechanism and, after reaction with essential oils, these two radicals can produce different responses.
