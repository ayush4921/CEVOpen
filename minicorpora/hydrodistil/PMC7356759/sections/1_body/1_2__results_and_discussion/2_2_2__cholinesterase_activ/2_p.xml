<p>Indeed, in spite of the multi-factorial nature of AD, the available therapeutic approach currently applied is based on the cholinergic hypothesis, which postulates that at least some of the cognitive decline experienced by patients affected by AD results from a deficiency in neurotransmitter acetylcholine and, thus, in a reduced cholinergic neurotransmission in brain cortical or hippocampal regions. Therefore, restoring the levels of acetylcholine through the inhibition of both cholinesterases is a useful therapeutic approach to treat AD. Both rosemary essential oils inhibited AChE and BChE in a concentration-dependent manner. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) values and selectivity index (SI) are reported in
