<p>Some studies have analysed structureâ€“activity relationships for monoterpenes and AChE inhibitory activity [
 <xref rid="B42-plants-09-00798" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. One of these works proposed that the interactions of the hydrocarbon skeletal of terpenes are with the AChE hydrophobic active center. Since the hydrophobicity degree of the active site on the AChE is described to be different among the globular forms of AChE, this may further explain the variation in inhibition seen between studies. In conclusion, the inhibitory activity of the essential oil likely results from a complex interaction of its chemical components, ultimately producing synergistic or antagonistic inhibitory responses [
