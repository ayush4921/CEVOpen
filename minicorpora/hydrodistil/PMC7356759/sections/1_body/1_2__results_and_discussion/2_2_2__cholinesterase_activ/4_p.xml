<p>A promising AChE inhibitory activity was observed also with Spanish

 <sub>50</sub> values of 68.4 μg/mL [

 <xref rid="B36-plants-09-00798" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] who assessed the AChE inhibitory activity of rosemary essential oil from Portugal, finding an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 69.8 μg/mL. Less activity was reported for Tunisian 
 <italic>S. rosmarinus</italic> essential oil with inhibition percentage of 36.2% at concentration of 50 mg/mL against AChE [

 <italic>S. rosmarinus</italic> essential oil was previously investigated by Orhan et al. [
 <xref rid="B38-plants-09-00798" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. An inhibitions’ percentage of 63.7 and 74% at concentration of 1 mg/mL, respectively for AChE and BChE enzymes, was observed.
