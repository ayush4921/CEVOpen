<p>Among identified compounds, α-pinene, 1,8-cineole, and camphor exhibited IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.63, 0.67 mM, and &gt;10 mM and showed to be competitively reversible inhibitors of AChE [
 <xref rid="B39-plants-09-00798" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. More recently, 1,8-cineole and camphor were investigated against AChE. IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 2.27 and 21.43 µM, respectively, were found [
 <xref rid="B40-plants-09-00798" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. A percentage of AChE inhibition of 48.5% at 1 mM was found for β-pinene [

 <italic>trans</italic>-caryophyllene revealed an AChE inhibition of 32% at the final concentration of 0.06 mM with a more selective activity against BChE (IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 78.6 μM) [
