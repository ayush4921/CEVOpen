<p>Forty-one samples of 
 <italic>S. rosmarinus</italic> collected in different locations of Sicily were analysed by Napoli et al. [
 <xref rid="B32-plants-09-00798" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Monoterpenes, both hydrocarbons (range of 21–68%) and oxygenated (range of 29–79%), were the most highly represented components. Three essential oils obtained from aerial parts of 
 <italic>S. rosmarinus</italic> growing in Tunisia were analysed with detection of 38 components. Among them, 1,8-cineole and camphor were found in more content (33.08–37.75% and 13.55–18.13%, respectively) than our essential oils, but similar values for α-pinene (8.58–9.32%), α-terpineol (6.79–8.17%), camphene (5.07–5.58%), and borneol (4.08–5.48%) were observed [
