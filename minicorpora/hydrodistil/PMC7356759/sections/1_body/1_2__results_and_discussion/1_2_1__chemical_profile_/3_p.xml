<p>The relative quantities, presence, and/or absence of rosemary essential oils’ constituents are strongly affected by environmental conditions and agronomic management practices, as shown in literature data. According to Pintore et al. [
 <xref rid="B31-plants-09-00798" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], Angioni et al. [
 <xref rid="B10-plants-09-00798" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] demonstrated that Sardinian rosemary essential oil is an α-pinene/borneol/bornyl acetate/verbenone chemotype. Compared with our essential oils, Sardinian samples presented more content in α-pinene (~23%), borneol (~16%), bornyl-acetate (~10.4%), and camphene (~7.6%) but lower camphor content in camphor (~4.5%). Verbenone compound was not detected in our essential oils. In Corsican rosemary essential oil, the same trend and similar values were observed: α-pinene &gt; borneol &gt; bornyl acetate &gt; verbenone.
