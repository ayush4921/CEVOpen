<p>The main volatiles were monoterpene hydrocarbons (40.7 and 39.32%, respectively per R1 and R2), followed by oxygenated monoterpenes (36.08 and 39.47%, respectively per R1 and R2) and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (16.5 and 18.21%, respectively per R1 and R2). The 1,8-cineole, α-pinene, 
 <italic>trans</italic>-caryophyllene, and β-pinene are the most abundant compounds of both rosemary essential oils (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-09-00798">Figure S3</xref>). The 1,8-cineole content was highest in R2 (21.89%) compared to R1 (16.98%). 
 <italic>Trans</italic>-caryophyllene content was greater in R1 (10.58) than R2 (8.62%). Conversely, a similar value was observed for α-pinene (10.96 and 10.37%, for R2 and R1, respectively). Significant amounts of camphor (11.08 and 7.27%, respectively for R2 and R1) and camphene (6.87% and 6.30%, respectively for R2 and R1) were found. The δ-3-sarene, α-cubebene, δ-selinene, β-bisabolene, and γ-cadinene were not detected in R1 sample. On the other hand, linalool, α-thujone, terpinen-4-ol, and α-copaene were not identified or were absent in sample R2.
