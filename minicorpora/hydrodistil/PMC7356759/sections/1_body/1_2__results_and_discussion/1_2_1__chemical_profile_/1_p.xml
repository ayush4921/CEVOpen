<p>The essential oils obtained by hydrodistillation of 
 <italic>S. rosmarinus</italic> aerial parts collected in two areas of Calabria (Southern Italy) were herein investigated. The main constituents are listed in 
 <xref rid="plants-09-00798-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Thirty-one compounds were identified, accounting for 97.48 and 98.78% of the total composition of essential oil for R1 (essential oil of 
 <italic>S. rosmarinus</italic> from Ionian coast) and R2 (essential oil of 
 <italic>S. rosmarinus</italic> from Tyrrhenian coast), respectively. Chromatograms are reported in
