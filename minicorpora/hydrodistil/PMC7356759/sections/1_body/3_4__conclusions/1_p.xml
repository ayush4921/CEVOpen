<p>In this work, two Calabrian rosemary populations (collected on the Ionian and Tyrrhenian coasts) were studied. Chemical analyses revealed 1,8-cineole, Î±-pinene, camphor, and 
 <italic>trans</italic>-caryophyllene as the most representative compounds. However, differences occurred between samples, suggesting that a different chemical composition of the essential oils is subject to change under the influence of various factors including climatic conditions and environmental factors. Our results confirmed 
 <italic>S. rosmarinus</italic> essential oils, in particular, the Tyrrhenian sample, as a promising source of natural cholinesterase inhibitors useful in the management and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.
