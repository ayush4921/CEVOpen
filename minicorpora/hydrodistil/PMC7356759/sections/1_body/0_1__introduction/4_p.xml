 <xref rid="B23-plants-09-00798" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. At present, there is no a therapeutic approach that can delay the AD progression, but available treatment has provided symptomatic benefits. Nowadays, two main classes of drugs are available for AD patients: Cholinesterase inhibitors, such as donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine, and the glutamate antagonist memantine [
 <xref rid="B24-plants-09-00798" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Two cholinesterases, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), participate in cholinergic neurotransmission by hydrolysing acetylcholine (Ach) in the central and peripheral nervous system. AChE is responsible for the degradation of Ach in the synaptic cleft of cholinergic synapses and neuromuscular junctions into choline and acetate. It has a crucial role in regulating many functions such as learning, memory, cerebral blood flow control, and cortical organization of movement. On the other hand, BChE has a higher activity in liver, heart, intestine, kidney, and lung. The enzymes share 65% amino acids’ sequence homology and show similar molecular forms and active sites. Oxidative stress has been identified as a contributing factor in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. The abnormal cellular metabolism caused by the excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) could affect both production and accumulation of β-amyloid that could exacerbate cellular dysfunction and ROS production, thus contributing to a vicious cycle [
