0: The analysis of the genetic variation pattern in the Mediterranean area [ 3] highlighted the presence of a basal haplotype from which four branches derived, consisting of a total of nine haplotypes clustered in two co-ancestry groups of populations.
1: This work included one Calabrian population, which was found with the two widely shared basal haplotypes.
2: Nonetheless, plants outside the core distribution of the species were proven to show a different chemical profile and biological activity [ 8].
3: Calabrian populations are in the eastern side of the species distribution range and differ from plants commonly cultivated by the prostrate habitus of individuals.
