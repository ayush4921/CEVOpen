<p>Phytochemical studies on this 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> species have reported the presence of different classes of bioactive compounds mainly including polyphenols, phenol diterpenes, and triterpenes. Rosmarinic acid, carnosic acid, carnosol, caffeic acid, betulinic acid, and ursolic acid are the dominant constituents. 
 <italic>S. rosmarinus</italic> is also a rich source of essential oil [

Taking into account that numerous aspects, such as area of collection, time of harvest, and environmental and agronomic factors, influence the chemical composition of rosemary essential oil, several studies analysed the chemical profile of rosemary essential oil in different stages of ontogenesis in Greece [
