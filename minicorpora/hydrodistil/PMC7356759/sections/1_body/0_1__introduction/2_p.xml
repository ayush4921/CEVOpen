<p>The analysis of the genetic variation pattern in the Mediterranean area [
 <xref rid="B3-plants-09-00798" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] highlighted the presence of a basal haplotype from which four branches derived, consisting of a total of nine haplotypes clustered in two co-ancestry groups of populations. This work included one Calabrian population, which was found with the two widely shared basal haplotypes. Nonetheless, plants outside the core distribution of the species were proven to show a different chemical profile and biological activity [
