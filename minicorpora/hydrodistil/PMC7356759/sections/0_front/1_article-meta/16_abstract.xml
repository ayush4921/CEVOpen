 <p>The chemical composition of the essential oil from 
  <italic>Salvia rosmarinus</italic> Spenn. collected in Calabrian Ionian (R1) and Tyrrhenian (R2) coast (Southern Italy) was examined by gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Essential oils are mainly characterized by monoterpene hydrocarbons (39.32–40.70%) and oxygenated monoterpenes (36.08-39.47%). The 1,8-cineole, α-pinene, camphor, and 
  <italic>trans</italic>-caryophyllene are the most representative compounds. 
  <italic>S. rosmarinus</italic> essential oils were investigated for their antioxidant activity by using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2′-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), ferric reducing ability power (FRAP), and β-carotene bleaching tests. Additionally, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibitory activity assays were used to screen the neuroprotective effects of 
  <italic>S. rosmarinus</italic>. R2 showed the highest antioxidant potential as confirmed by relative antioxidant capacity index (RACI) and exhibited a selective activity against AChE (half maximal inhibitory concentration, IC
  <sub>50</sub>, value of 41.86 μg/mL). These results suggest 
  <italic>S. rosmarinus</italic> essential oil as a potential source of bioactive compounds.
