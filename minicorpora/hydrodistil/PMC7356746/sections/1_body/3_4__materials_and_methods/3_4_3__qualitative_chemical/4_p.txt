0: In order to identify the components of the EO, the linear retention index (LRI) of each constituent was calculated according to Van Den Dool and Kratz [ 36] and compared to literature, together with the corresponding mass spectrum (see  Table 1).
1: LRIs were calculated through the homologous series of linear alkanes, using a mixture from  n-nonane to  n-pentacosane ( n-nonane purity was 99% from BDH, Dubai, UAE.
2: C 10C 25 purity was 99% from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA).
