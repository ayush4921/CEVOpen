<p>In order to identify the components of the EO, the linear retention index (LRI) of each constituent was calculated according to Van Den Dool and Kratz [
 <xref rid="B36-plants-09-00791" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and compared to literature, together with the corresponding mass spectrum (see 
 <xref rid="plants-09-00791-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). LRIs were calculated through the homologous series of linear alkanes, using a mixture from 
 <italic>n</italic>-nonane to 
 <italic>n</italic>-pentacosane (
 <italic>n</italic>-nonane purity was 99% from BDH, Dubai, UAE. C
 <sub>10</sub>â€“C
 <sub>25</sub> purity was 99% from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA).
