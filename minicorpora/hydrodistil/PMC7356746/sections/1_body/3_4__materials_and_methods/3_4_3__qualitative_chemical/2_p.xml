<p>The GC-MS analyses on DB-5ms were performed as follow: the carrier gas was helium, set at constant flow, with a rate of 1 mL/min. All the chromatographic runs were performed injecting 1 μL. The injector was set in split mode (40:1), with an injection temperature of 250 °C. The elution was conducted from 50 °C (1 min) to 250 °C (10 min) at a gradient rate of 3 °C/min.</p>
