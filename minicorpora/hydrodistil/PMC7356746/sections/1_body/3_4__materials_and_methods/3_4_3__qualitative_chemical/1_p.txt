0: The qualitative chemical analyses were performed with a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) system, constituted by an Agilent Technologies gas chromatograph 6890N coupled to a simple quadrupole Mass Spectrometry Detector (MSD) model 5973 (Santa Clara, CA, USA).
1: The MSD was operated in SCAN mode, with an electronic ionization source of 70 eV.
2: The ion detection was limited to the range of 35350 m/z.
3: The transfer line was set at the temperature of 280 C, the MS ion source at 200 C. The gas chromatograph was configurated with a DB-5ms non-polar (5%-phenyl-methylpolysiloxane, 30 m, 0.25 mm internal diameter, and 0.25 m film thickness; J & W Scientific, Folsom, CA, USA) and a HP-INNOWax polar (polyethylene glycol, 30 m, 0.25 mm internal diameter and 0.25 m film thickness; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) capillary columns.
