<p>The qualitative chemical analyses were performed with a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) system, constituted by an Agilent Technologies gas chromatograph 6890N coupled to a simple quadrupole Mass Spectrometry Detector (MSD) model 5973 (Santa Clara, CA, USA). The MSD was operated in SCAN mode, with an electronic ionization source of 70 eV. The ion detection was limited to the range of 35–350 m/z. The transfer line was set at the temperature of 280 °C, the MS ion source at 200 °C. The gas chromatograph was configurated with a DB-5ms non-polar (5%-phenyl-methylpolysiloxane, 30 m, 0.25 mm internal diameter, and 0.25 μm film thickness; J &amp; W Scientific, Folsom, CA, USA) and a HP-INNOWax polar (polyethylene glycol, 30 m, 0.25 mm internal diameter and 0.25 μm film thickness; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) capillary columns.</p>
