<p>The analytical conditions were the same described for the qualitative analyses, but with a different thermal program. In fact, with DB-5ms column, the initial temperature of 50 °C was kept for 1 min, followed by a thermal gradient of 3 °C/min until 180 °C, then a second thermal gradient of 15 °C/min until 250 °C. The final temperature was maintained for 15 min. For what concerns the analysis on HP-INNOWax, the same GC method as DB-5ms was applied, except for the final temperature that only reached 230 °C. The FID was alimented with a mixture of hydrogen and air, at the flow of 30 mL/min and 300 mL/min respectively. The detector was set at the temperature of 250 °C. In order to quantify the analytes, a relative response factor (RRF) was calculated for each component, according to the respective combustion enthalpy [

 <xref rid="B38-plants-09-00791" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In this respect, A. Chaintreau and colleagues demonstrated that the RRF of an organic compound, analyzed by FID, only depends, with good approximation, on its molecular formula and number of aromatic rings. According to this principle, they described a mathematical formula [

In our case, a modified method was actually applied, since isopropyl caproate was used instead of methyl octanoate and two calibration curves (one for each column) have been used instead of a single point internal standard. The isopropyl caproate was prepared by synthesis in one of the authors’ laboratory (G.G.) and its purity was calculated by GC as 97%. For calibration curves construction, six calibration standard dilutions were prepared, dissolving 0.6, 1.8, 4.3, 8.3, 16.8, and 34.3 mg of isopropyl caproate in 10 mL of cyclohexane respectively. As usual, an amount of 7.0 mg of
