0: The following thermal program was applied: 50 C maintained for 5 min, then a gradient temperature of 2 C/min until 220 C, that were kept for 5 min.
1: The enantiomer order of elution was determined through the injection, in the same instrumental conditions, of mixtures of enantiomerically pure standards.
