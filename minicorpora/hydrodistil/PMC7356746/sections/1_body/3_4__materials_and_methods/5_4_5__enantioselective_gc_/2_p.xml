<p>The following thermal program was applied: 50 °C maintained for 5 min, then a gradient temperature of 2 °C/min until 220 °C, that were kept for 5 min. The enantiomer order of elution was determined through the injection, in the same instrumental conditions, of mixtures of enantiomerically pure standards.</p>
