<p>In order to obtain the pure essential oil, 3 kg of fresh plant material were preparatively hydrodistilled for 4 h, inside a stainless-steel Clevenger-type apparatus. After recovery of the organic layer, the EO was dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate. For all the GC injections, 10 mg of EO were weighted and diluted with 1 mL of cyclohexane, previously prepared with an internal standard (
 <italic>n</italic>-nonane) at the concentration of 0.7 mg/mL. Additionally, four portions of 10 mL of the water layer were collected and eluted on previously conditioned solid phase extraction (SPE) columns. After complete removal of water from the solid phase, the analytes were recovered by elution with 2 mL of acetone prepared, as previously described for cyclohexane, dissolving 
 <italic>n</italic>-nonane as internal standard (0.7 mg/mL). The acetone solutions were directly injected into GC. The SPE columns were standard products, packed with 1 g of C-18 reversed phase and purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
