0: In order to obtain the pure essential oil, 3 kg of fresh plant material were preparatively hydrodistilled for 4 h, inside a stainless-steel Clevenger-type apparatus.
1: After recovery of the organic layer, the EO was dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate.
2: For all the GC injections, 10 mg of EO were weighted and diluted with 1 mL of cyclohexane, previously prepared with an internal standard ( n-nonane) at the concentration of 0.7 mg/mL.
3: Additionally, four portions of 10 mL of the water layer were collected and eluted on previously conditioned solid phase extraction (SPE) columns.
4: After complete removal of water from the solid phase, the analytes were recovered by elution with 2 mL of acetone prepared, as previously described for cyclohexane, dissolving  n-nonane as internal standard (0.7 mg/mL).
5: The acetone solutions were directly injected into GC.
6: The SPE columns were standard products, packed with 1 g of C-18 reversed phase and purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
