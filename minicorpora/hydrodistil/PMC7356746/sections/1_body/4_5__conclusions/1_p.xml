<p>The leaves of 
 <italic>Piper coruscans</italic> Kunth contain a volatile fraction of prevalently sesquiterpene composition. The hydrodistillation of the leaves produces an essential oil, whose known major compounds are (
 <italic>E</italic>)-β-caryophyllene (24.1–25.0%), α-humulene (11.6–12.0%), caryophyllene oxide (9.3–10.9%), linalool (4.5–5.2%), humulene epoxide II (3.6–4.1%), (
 <italic>E</italic>)-nerolidol (3.7–4.0%), α-copaene (3.7–3.9%), α-muurolol (3.4–3.7%), α-selinene (3.4–3.5%), and β-selinene (3.1–3.3%). The sesquiterpene fraction of this EO counts for more than 80% of the chemical composition. For what concerns the monoterpene fraction, at least five of its chiral components subsist as mixtures of enantiomeric pairs.
