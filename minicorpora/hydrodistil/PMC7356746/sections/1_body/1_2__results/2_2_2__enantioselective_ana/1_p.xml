<p>The enantioselective analysis was performed on two enantioselective columns: a 2,3-diethyl-6-
 <italic>tert</italic>-butyldimethylsilyl-β-cyclodextrin and a 2,3-diacetyl-6-
 <italic>tert</italic>-butyldimethylsilyl-β-cyclodextrin based capillary columns. A total of five enantiomeric pairs were identified, all belonging to the class of monoterpenes and monoterpenoids. None of the detected chiral compounds was enantiomerically pure. The complete enantioelective analysis is represented in
