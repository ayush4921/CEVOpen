<p>The essential oil was obtained with a distillation yield of 0.4 ± 0.26% from fresh plant material. The chemical analyses were performed on two different columns, a non-polar one (DB-5ms) and a polar one (HP-INNOWax), detecting a total of 58 compounds. Most of the constituents (52) were identified by comparing the electron impact mass spectrum (EIMS) and the linear retention index (LRI) with literature, whereas 6 remained unidentified. According to their molecular weight, the unknown components are consistent with one sesquiterpene (204 amu) and five oxygenated sesquiterpenoids (220 and 222 amu). For what concerns the quantitative analysis, 46 identified constituents, corresponding to about 91% of the EO, could be quantified on at least one column, whereas 6 compounds (camphene, p-cymene, terpinen-4-ol, cyclosativene, β-cubebene, and aromadendrene) appeared as traces (&lt;0.1%) in both columns. In this case, due to the abundance of oxygenated terpenoids, the existence of an important residual organic fraction dissolved in the aqueous phase (hydrolate) was supposed. Hence, the distillation water phase was analyzed in the same conditions of the EO, after concentration by solid phase extraction (SPE). The results were expressed as milligrams of analytes per 100 mL of water. The main organic substance in solution was linalool, with an abundance of 12.3–15.7 mg/100 mL. All the analytical results are reported in
