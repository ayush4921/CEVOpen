<p>The chemical analysis of this essential oil was complemented with the enantioselective one, where the enantiomeric distribution and the enantiomeric excess (
 <italic>e.e.</italic>) of some monoterpenes and monoterpenoids were determined and confirmed on two different enantioselective columns. None of the detected chiral metabolites was present in its enantiomerically pure form, however β-pinene and linalool were almost racemic, with just a small 
 <italic>e.e.</italic> in favor of (1
 <italic>S</italic>,5
 <italic>S</italic>)-(-)-β-pinene and (
 <italic>R</italic>)-(-)-linalool.
