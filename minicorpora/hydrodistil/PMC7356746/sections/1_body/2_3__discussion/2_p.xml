<p>For what concerns the aqueous phase that spontaneously separates from an EO after distillation, commonly called hydrolate, it is well known that sometimes it has an important commercial value, such is the case for example of rose water or mint water. For the EO of 
 <italic>P. coruscans</italic>, the high content of oxygenated terpenoids suggested that an important residue could remain dissolved in water, which effectively presented a clear sweet odor. The chemical analysis of the hydrolate revealed that linalool is actually the very most abundant organic solute, reaching the concentration of about 15 mg/100 mL (150 ppm), what explains the perceived aroma.
