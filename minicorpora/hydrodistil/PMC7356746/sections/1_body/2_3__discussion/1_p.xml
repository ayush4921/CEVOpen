<p>According to literature [
 <xref rid="B14-plants-09-00791" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], some authors classify the EOs distilled from the species of genus 
 <italic>Piper</italic> into six categories, depending on their chemical composition: EOs dominated by monoterpenes (mainly limonene, sabinene, β-pinene, α-pinene, and piperitone), EOs dominated by sesquiterpenes (typically β-caryophyllene, germacrene D, β-elemene, 
 <italic>epi</italic>-cubebol, β-guaiene, and β-bisabolene), EOs equally dominated by both families of terpenoids, EOs dominated by phenylpropanoids (for example safrole, dillapole, eugenol, chavibetol, and (
 <italic>Z</italic>)-asarone), EOs dominated by benzenoid compounds and EOs dominated by non-terpenoid compounds (usually derivatives from the acetate pathway). Observing the chemical analysis performed in the present study, we can conclude that the EO distilled from the leaves of 
 <italic>P. coruscans</italic> clearly belongs to the second group. In fact, despite α-pinene, β-pinene and linalool were present in a significant amount, about 80% of the chemical composition corresponded to sesquiterpenes and sesquiterpenoids. In particular, (
 <italic>E</italic>)-β-caryophyllene (24.1–25.0%), α-humulene (11.6–12.0%), and caryophyllene oxide (9.3–10.9%) were clearly dominant. In this case, the plant material was freshly distilled after collection and the EO immediately injected, what makes the authors think that no artefact was significantly produced. However, caryophyllene oxide is sometime considered as a result of aging in a (
 <italic>E</italic>)-β-caryophyllene containing EO. If this were the case, the real amount of (
 <italic>E</italic>)-β-caryophyllene would overpass 30%. The very high content of (
 <italic>E</italic>)-β-caryophyllene makes 
 <italic>P. coruscans</italic> EO relatively quite similar to the one obtained from fruits of 
 <italic>P. nigrum</italic> (black pepper), where the abundance of this sesquiterpene ranges normally between 15–50% but it can rise until 70% in some Malaysian cultivars [
 <xref rid="B14-plants-09-00791" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The high amount of (
 <italic>E</italic>)-β-caryophyllene also opens the way to the study of interesting biological properties for this EO, according to great number of bioactivities described in literature for this sesquiterpene [
