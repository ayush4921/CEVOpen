<p>Ecuador is a small country located across the Equatorial line, overlooking the Pacific Ocean in the northern portion of the South American continent. It is geographically and climatically divided in four main regions: The islands (Galapagos), the coast, the Andean region, and the Amazonian forest. Each one of these zones is characterized by a peculiar climate, what makes biodiversity an incredible strength for the country. That is why Ecuador has been recognized by the UN Environment Program World Conservation Monitoring Centre as one of the 17 megadiverse countries in the world, counting by definition with “at least 5000 of the world’s plants as endemics” [
