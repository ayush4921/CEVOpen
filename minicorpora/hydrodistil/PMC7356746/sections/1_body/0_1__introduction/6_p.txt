0: Despite a lot of literature exists about the chemistry of genus  Piper, only about 10% of all known  Piper species have been submitted to a phytochemical study [ 14].
1: For what concerns  P. coruscans, seven references have been found in literature.
2: Six of them were related to the chemistry, synthesis, and biological activity of non-volatile extracts and metabolites (mainly coruscanones) [ 15, 16, 17, 18, 19], whereas only one cited the essential oil [ 20].
3: However, nowhere the chemical or the enantioselective analysis was reported.
4: On the other hand, no literature was found about any synonyms of this species, whereby, to the best of the authors knowledge, this study describes for the first time an EO distilled from  Piper coruscans Kunth.
