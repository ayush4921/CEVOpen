<p>Among the natural products the authors are interested in, we can cite essential oils (EOs) [

 <xref rid="B11-plants-09-00791" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. According to the European Pharmacopeia, an EO is an “odorous product, usually of complex composition, obtained from a botanically defined plant raw material by steam distillation, dry distillation, or a suitable mechanical process without heating. Essential oils are usually separated from the aqueous phase by a physical process that does not significantly affect their composition” [
