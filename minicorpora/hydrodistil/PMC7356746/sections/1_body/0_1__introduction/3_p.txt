0: Among the natural products the authors are interested in, we can cite essential oils (EOs) [ 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11].
1: According to the European Pharmacopeia, an EO is an odorous product, usually of complex composition, obtained from a botanically defined plant raw material by steam distillation, dry distillation, or a suitable mechanical process without heating.
2: Essential oils are usually separated from the aqueous phase by a physical process that does not significantly affect their composition [ 12].
3: In this context, the authors decided to describe the chemical and enantiomeric composition of the EO distilled from the leaves of  Piper coruscans Kunth.
