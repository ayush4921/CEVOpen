<p>Despite a lot of literature exists about the chemistry of genus 
 <italic>Piper</italic>, only about 10% of all known 
 <italic>Piper</italic> species have been submitted to a phytochemical study [
 <xref rid="B14-plants-09-00791" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. For what concerns 
 <italic>P. coruscans</italic>, seven references have been found in literature. Six of them were related to the chemistry, synthesis, and biological activity of non-volatile extracts and metabolites (mainly coruscanones) [

 <xref rid="B20-plants-09-00791" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, nowhere the chemical or the enantioselective analysis was reported. On the other hand, no literature was found about any synonyms of this species, whereby, to the best of the authorsâ€™ knowledge, this study describes for the first time an EO distilled from 
 <italic>Piper coruscans</italic> Kunth.
