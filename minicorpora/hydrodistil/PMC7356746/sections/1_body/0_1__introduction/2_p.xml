<p>Every year, botanists discover and describe in Ecuador new botanical species, that are added to the approximately 16,000 already known. According to the most complete botanical publication on the Ecuadorian flora [
 <xref rid="B2-plants-09-00791" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], 15,306 native species were known in 1999, of which 4173 were endemic. Most of the native plants described in this country have never been investigated so far for what concerns their metabolic composition [
