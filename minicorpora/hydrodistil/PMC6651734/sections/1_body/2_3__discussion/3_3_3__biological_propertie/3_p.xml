<p>Regarding anti-inflammatory activity, we investigated the lipoxygenase inhibitory properties of the isolated essential oils. The results showed that all of the tested essential oils have strong lipoxygenase inhibitory activity due to the presence of β-caryophyllene, α-pinene and methylketones. These compounds are well-known for their anti-inflammatory activity [
