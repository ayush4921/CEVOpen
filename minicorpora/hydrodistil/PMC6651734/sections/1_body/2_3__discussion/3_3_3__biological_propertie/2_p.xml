<p>Several analytical methods have been developed to determine the antioxidant capacity of natural substances in vitro. Here, the DPPH radical scavenging and FRAP methods were used to evaluate the antioxidant activity of the essential oils. The two tests showed that the essential oils isolated from 
 <italic>Z. mezoneurispinosum</italic> have a better antioxidant activity than those isolated from 
 <italic>Z. psammophilum</italic>, probably due to their different chemical composition. The weak antioxidant activity of the 
 <italic>Z. psammophilum</italic> essential oils may be due to their high non-terpenic compound content. The essential oils isolated from 
 <italic>Z. mezoneurispinozum</italic> were found to be rich in monoterpenes, which are molecules known for their high antioxidant activity [

 <italic>Z. mezoneurispinosum</italic> roots contained a high proportion of thymol, which is a molecule that is known to have antioxidant properties [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-24-02445" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The presence of this compound could explain why the antioxidant activity of the essential oil isolated from 
 <italic>Z. mezoneurispinosum</italic> roots was higher than that isolated from 
 <italic>Z. psammophilum</italic>.
