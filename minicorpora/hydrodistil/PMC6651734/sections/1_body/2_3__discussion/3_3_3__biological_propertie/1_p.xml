<p>A wide range of molecules with interesting biological properties were identified in the essential oils produced from the different organs of the two 
 <italic>Zanthoxylum</italic> species. Reports on the interesting biological properties of solvant extracts and essential oils from a range of 
 <italic>Zanthoxylum</italic> species can also be found in the literature [

 <xref rid="B34-molecules-24-02445" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. For instance, 
 <italic>Zanthoxylum limonella</italic> and 
 <italic>Z. leprieurii</italic> were shown to have antioxidant activities, and 
 <italic>Z. armatum</italic> was shown to possess anti-inflammatory properties [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-24-02445" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. It would seem then plausible to reveal antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of the essential oils that were isolated in this paper.
