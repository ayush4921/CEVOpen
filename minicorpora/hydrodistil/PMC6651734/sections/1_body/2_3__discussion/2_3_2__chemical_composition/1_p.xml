<p>This work represents the first report regarding the characterization of the chemical composition of the essential oils isolated from the different organs of 
 <italic>Zanthoxylum</italic> species. Methylketones were found as main dominant chemical component of the essential oils isolated from aerial parts of 
 <italic>Z. psammophilum</italic>. This is consistent with the chemical composition of essential oils isolated from the leaves and trunk bark of 
 <italic>Z. leprieurii</italic> from Côte d’Ivoire [

 <italic>Z. armatum</italic> and Australian 
 <italic>Z. pinnatum</italic>, methylketones have also been reported as major components of leaves essential oils (undecan-2-one (54.3%) and tridecan-2-one (31.7%)) for the former and undecan-2-one (46.0%) and tridecan-2-one (27.1%) for the latter [

 <xref rid="B17-molecules-24-02445" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, when comparing the methylketones proportion in these two species with the ones in 
 <italic>Z. psammophilum</italic>, it appeared that tridecan-2-one compound is the most dominant in 
 <italic>Z. psammophilum</italic> leaves whereas in the trunk bark, it was the undecan-2-one which was the prevailing molecule. This could suggest that the leaves and trunk bark of 
 <italic>Z. psammophilum</italic> could exhibit interesting properties as they are used for their flavor and fragrance in the food, pharmaceutical, and perfumery industries [

 <xref rid="B20-molecules-24-02445" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The composition of the essential oil isolated from 
 <italic>Z. psammophilum</italic> roots was different to those isolated from the aerial parts of the plant, as β-caryophyllene (21.8%), α-humulene (13.6%), and thymol (15.7%) were the main compounds in the root oil. The high proportion of β-caryophyllene in this oil is interesting because this molecule is known to have several biological activities, including good antioxidant properties [
