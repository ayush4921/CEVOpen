<p>The complete chemical characterization of essential oils isolated from organs of 
 <italic>Z. psammophilum</italic> and 
 <italic>Z. mezoneurispinosum</italic> allows us to highlight the potential of these two plants as a source of therapeutic molecules for use in traditional medicine. We found compounds with antibacterial, antimicrobial, and antioxidant activities in the different essential oils that we isolated. Moreover, other applications might be considered for some of the newly described essential oils. Some could, in fact, be used as a new source of raw material for the flavour industry or as a new bioactive agent in pest management.
