<p>Monoterpenoids dominated the chemical composition of the essential oils isolated from aerial parts of 
 <italic>Z. mezoneurispinosum</italic>. This is in agreement with the chemical composition of several other 
 <italic>Zanthoxylum</italic> species [

 <xref rid="B23-molecules-24-02445" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Moreover, two new compounds, (
 <italic>E</italic>)-β-ocimene and γ-eudesmol, which, to our knowledge, have not been described before in these species, were present in their essential oils. These two molecules have interesting antioxidant, antibacterial, and antimicrobial properties [

 <xref rid="B25-molecules-24-02445" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Additionally, the essential oil isolated from 
 <italic>Z. mezoneurispinosum</italic> roots was found to be rich in sesquiterpenoids, as high quantities of cyclosativene (11.9%) were present in this oil. This is an interesting finding, as it appears that this molecule has only been found before in trace quantities in leaf essential oils obtained from 
 <italic>Xylopia aromatica</italic> and 
 <italic>Persea americanum</italic>, which are grown in Cuba [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-24-02445" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. To our knowledge, this is the first time that high quantities of this compound have been described in an essential oil. The high content of cyclosativene is of consequence for the valorization of this essential oil as this molecule has strong antimicrobial, antioxidant, and insecticidal properties [

 <xref rid="B30-molecules-24-02445" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Moreover, γ-elemene (24.8%), which is a molecule known for its insecticidal, antimicrobial, and antioxidant properties, was reported in high quantities in essential oil isolated from 
 <italic>Z. mezoneurispinosum</italic> roots [
