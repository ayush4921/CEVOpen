<p>In this study, essential oils were isolated from different organs of 
 <italic>Z. psammophilum</italic> and 
 <italic>Z. mezoneurispinosum</italic>, two plant species endemic to Côte d’Ivoire [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-24-02445" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. For several other 
 <italic>Zanthoxylum</italic> species, the literature reports essential oil hydrodistillation yields that range from 0.05 to 1.90% (
 <italic>w/w</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-24-02445" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-24-02445" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-24-02445" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The yields of essential oils isolated from leaves and roots of 
 <italic>Z. psammophilum</italic> (0.05% and 0.02%, 
 <italic>w/w</italic>), and from leaves, trunk bark, and roots of 
 <italic>Z. mezoneurispinosum</italic> (0.50%, 0.2% and 0.04%, 
 <italic>w/w</italic>), that were obtained in the present study seem, therefore, to be consistent with those reported in the literature. The yield value of essential oil of 3.2% (
 <italic>w/w</italic>) that was obtained from the trunk bark of 
 <italic>Z. psammophilum</italic> seems to be high; however, it is similar to the yield obtained from dried fruits of another 
 <italic>Zanthoxylum</italic> species (
 <italic>Zanthoxylum leprieurii</italic> from Cameroon) [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-24-02445" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and can be explained by the morphology of the trunk bark of this specie presenting a thick bark.
