0: Zanthoxylum psammophilum and  Zanthoxylum mezoneurispinosum are two species of the genus  Zanthoxylum that are endemic to Cote dIvoire [ 11].
1: Z. psammophilum is a thin, hairless lianascent plant that grows up to 15 m tall and 2 cm in diameter with solitary stem spines.
2: Z. psammophilum presents a thick trunk bark that is easy to separate from the bark (the separation occurs at the vascular cambium level).
3: Its leaves are composed of five to seven pairs of alternate leaflets with a moderately thorny petiole ( Figure 1A).
4: Z. mezoneurispinosum is a sarmentary shrub that grows to 1015 m tall with twin stem spines.
5: The trunk bark is not very thick and is quite difficult to collect.
6: The spines of the relatively large, leafy shoots are black and measure 0.51 cm.
7: They are located on either side of the petiole, with the tip bent downwards ( Figure 1B).
8: The nonvolatile compounds that the roots of these two species produce have already been studied.
9: Two new benzophenanthridines, including 8-methoxy-7,8-dihydrofagaridine, were isolated from  Z. psammophilum roots.
10: Benzophenanthridines are known to have a wide range of interesting properties, including antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer activities [ 12].
11: A cycloheptapeptide, akeassimezorine, was also found in  Z. mezoneurispinosum roots [ 1].
12: To date, the volatile molecules of these two species have not been studied, either for their chemical composition or for their biological activities.
13: The aim of this work is to isolate essential oils from the leaves, trunk bark, and roots of these two species, characterize the oils by GC-MS, and evaluate their antioxidant and lipoxygenase inhibitory activities.
