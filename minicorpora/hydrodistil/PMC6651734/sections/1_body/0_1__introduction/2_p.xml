 <italic>Zanthoxylum psammophilum</italic> and 
 <italic>Zanthoxylum mezoneurispinosum</italic> are two species of the genus 
 <italic>Zanthoxylum</italic> that are endemic to Côte d’Ivoire [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-24-02445" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. 
 <italic>Z. psammophilum</italic> is a thin, hairless lianascent plant that grows up to 15 m tall and 2 cm in diameter with solitary stem spines. 
 <italic>Z. psammophilum</italic> presents a thick trunk bark that is easy to separate from the bark (the separation occurs at the vascular cambium level). Its leaves are composed of five to seven pairs of alternate leaflets with a moderately thorny petiole (

 <italic>Z. mezoneurispinosum</italic> is a sarmentary shrub that grows to 10–15 m tall with twin stem spines. The trunk bark is not very thick and is quite difficult to collect. The spines of the relatively large, leafy shoots are black and measure 0.5–1 cm. They are located on either side of the petiole, with the tip bent downwards (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02445-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). The nonvolatile compounds that the roots of these two species produce have already been studied. Two new benzophenanthridines, including 8-methoxy-7,8-dihydrofagaridine, were isolated from 
 <italic>Z. psammophilum</italic> roots. Benzophenanthridines are known to have a wide range of interesting properties, including antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer activities [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-24-02445" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. A cycloheptapeptide, akeassimezorine, was also found in 
 <italic>Z. mezoneurispinosum</italic> roots [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-24-02445" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. To date, the volatile molecules of these two species have not been studied, either for their chemical composition or for their biological activities. The aim of this work is to isolate essential oils from the leaves, trunk bark, and roots of these two species, characterize the oils by GC-MS, and evaluate their antioxidant and lipoxygenase inhibitory activities.
