<p>The lipoxygenase inhibitory activities of essential oils isolated from different organs of 
 <italic>Z. mezoneurispinosum</italic> and 
 <italic>Z. psammophilum</italic> were evaluated by measuring the ability of each oil to inhibit the activity of lipoxygenase, which is an enzyme involved in the inflammation process. Quercetin was used as the reference standard. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values are presented in 
 <xref rid="molecules-24-02445-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The results showed that the essential oils isolated from different organs of 
 <italic>Z. mezoneurispinosum</italic> had lower IC
 <sub>50</sub> values than those isolated from different organs of 
 <italic>Z. psammophilum</italic> (
 <italic>p</italic>-value &lt;0.05). For all essential oils and both plant species, dose effects were observed as higher essential oil concentrations always resulted in greater lipoxygenase inhibitory activities (
 <italic>p</italic>-value &lt;0.05).
