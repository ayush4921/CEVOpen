<p>The in vitro antioxidant activities of the essential oils isolated from the two 
 <italic>Zanthoxylum</italic> species were evaluated in two different ways. The 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical test was used to evaluate the H-donating or radical scavenging ability of the oils. The ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay was used to estimate the ferric-reducing capacity of the oils. For each tested essential oil and each assay, the concentration ranging from 100 to 25 Âµg/mL that caused a 50% inhibition of the oxidant activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) was determined and compared to a standard. A low IC
 <sub>50</sub> value indicates a high antioxidant activity.
