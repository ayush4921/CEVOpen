<p>The antioxidant activity of the essential oils was also evaluated using the reducing power test. The presence of reducing agents in oils causes a reduction of Fe
 <sup>3+</sup>, which is a complex in ferrous form. Therefore, we evaluated Fe
 <sup>2+</sup> by measuring and monitoring the increase in blue color density in reaction media of essential oils of 
 <italic>Z. mezoneurispinosum</italic> and 
 <italic>Z. psammophilum</italic>.

 <italic>Z. psammophilum</italic> essential oil. For each essential oil and each species, a dose effect was observed as a significant increase in antioxidant activity, which was found to be correlated with an increase in concentration (
 <italic>p</italic>-value &lt;0.001). Moreover, all of the essential oils isolated from 
 <italic>Z. mezoneurispinosum</italic> had higher antioxidant activities (
 <italic>p</italic>-value &lt;0.001) than those isolated from 
 <italic>Z. psammophilum</italic>.
