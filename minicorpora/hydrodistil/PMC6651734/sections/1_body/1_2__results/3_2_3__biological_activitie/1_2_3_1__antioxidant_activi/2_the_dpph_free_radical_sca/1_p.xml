<p>The antioxidant activities of essential oils isolated from different organs of both 
 <italic>Zanthoxylum</italic> species were evaluated with the DPPH assay. Trolox, a molecule well-known for its antioxidant properties, was used as a standard. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02445-f003">Figure 3</xref> shows the results. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of the essential oils varied by species and organ. For both plants, an increase in essential oil concentration induced a higher antioxidant activity (
 <italic>p</italic>-value &lt;0.05). Moreover, at the same concentration and for the same organ, all essential oils isolated from 
 <italic>Z. psammophilum</italic> had higher antioxidant activities than essential oils isolated from 
 <italic>Z. mezoneurispinosum</italic> (
 <italic>p</italic>-value &lt;0.001). For the 
 <italic>Z. mezoneurispinosum</italic> specie, the essential oil isolated from the roots showed the highest antioxidant activity, with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 45.8 ± 0.1 µg/mL. The Trolox standard showed an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 28.4 ± 1.1 µg/mL. The essential oils isolated from the trunk bark and leaves had IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 58.1 ± 1.2 µg/mL and 71.4 ± 0.5 µg/mL, respectively. The essential oils isolated from 
 <italic>Z. psammophilum</italic> exhibited higher IC
 <sub>50</sub> values: 64.5 ± 1.5 µg/mL for the roots, 91.5 ± 1.4 µg/mL for the leaves, and 160.5 ± 2.1 µg/mL for the trunk bark.
