<p>The analysis of the chemical composition of essential oils isolated from 
 <italic>Z. mezoneurispinosum</italic> organs revealed 15 compounds for the leaves, 19 compounds for the trunk bark, and 27 compounds for the roots. These compounds represent more than 99.9% of each essential oilâ€™s overall composition (
 <xref rid="molecules-24-02445-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The essential oils isolated from the trunk bark and from the leaves were predominantly composed of monoterpenes (83.3% and 92.1%, respectively). Sesquiterpenes represented 16.7% and 7.9% of the composition of the trunk bark oil and the leaf oil, respectively. The essential oil isolated from the roots was mainly composed of sesquiterpenes (81.5%) and monoterpenes (18.6%).
