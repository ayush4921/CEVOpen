<p>Different hydrodistillation yields were obtained depending on the species and on which fresh organ was hydrodistilled. Average yields of 0.5% and 0.05% for leaf oil, 0.2% and 3.2% for trunk bark oil, and 0.04% and 0.02% for root oil were obtained for 
 <italic>Z. mezoneurispinosum</italic> and 
 <italic>Z. psammophilum,</italic> respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02445-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Moreover, the obtained essential oils differed by their smells. For both species, leaves had a pronounced herbal scent, and roots had a spice-like scent. Nevertheless, the scent of the trunk bark differed between species. The 
 <italic>Z. mezoneurispinosum</italic> trunk bark oil had a wood-like scent, whereas the 
 <italic>Z. psammophilum</italic> trunk bark oil had a buttery note.
