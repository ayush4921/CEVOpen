<p>Various organs of 
 <italic>Z. psammophilum</italic> and 
 <italic>Z. mezoneurispinosum</italic>, including leaves, trunk bark, and roots, were collected in southeastern Côte d’Ivoire, namely Agboville (5°55′40″ N, 4°12′47″ W) and Grand Lahou (5°15′2.4″ N, 5°0′12″ W), in October and November 2017. The plant material was authenticated by botanists at the National Flora Center (CNF) (Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire) and the vegetation improvement laboratory of Nangui Abrogoua University (Côte d’Ivoire). A specimen of each species (AA21002 and AA21009 for 
 <italic>Z. psammophilum</italic> and 
 <italic>Z. mezoneurispinosum</italic>, respectively) was deposited at the Herbarium of the CNF. The scent of the essential oils was determined by five trained panelists. Fresh material (1.0–1.5 kg) was hydrodistillated for 3 h using a Clevenger-type apparatus. Essential oils were collected, dried over anhydrous Na
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>, stored in sealed amber vials, and kept under refrigeration (4–6 °C) until analysis. The essential oil hydrodistillation yield was determined as the ratio of the mass of oil after distillation to the mass of fresh organs.
