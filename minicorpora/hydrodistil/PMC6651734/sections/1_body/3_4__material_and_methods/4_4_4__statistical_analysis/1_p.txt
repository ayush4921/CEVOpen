0: The DPPH and FRAP methods were used to determine the antioxidant activity of the essential oils.
1: The measurements to determine the antioxidant activity as well as the lipoxygenase inhibitory activity were performed in triplicate.
2: Two factors were considered for the statistical analysis: the organ and the concentration.
3: Experimental data are expressed as mean  SD.
4: The analysis of variance between the different averages was carried out by ANOVA using the Minitab 18 software (Pennsylvania, PA, USA).
5: The significance level for the tests was set at 5%.
6: The structuring of averages was done using Dunnetts test.
7: A multiple comparison analysis was performed using Tukeys test on both DPPH and lipoxygenase inhibitory activities.
