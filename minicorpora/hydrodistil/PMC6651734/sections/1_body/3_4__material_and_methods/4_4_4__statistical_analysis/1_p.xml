<p>The DPPH and FRAP methods were used to determine the antioxidant activity of the essential oils. The measurements to determine the antioxidant activity as well as the lipoxygenase inhibitory activity were performed in triplicate. Two factors were considered for the statistical analysis: the organ and the concentration. Experimental data are expressed as mean ± SD. The analysis of variance between the different averages was carried out by ANOVA using the Minitab 18 software (Pennsylvania, PA, USA). The significance level for the tests was set at 5%. The structuring of averages was done using Dunnett’s test. A multiple comparison analysis was performed using Tukey’s test on both DPPH and lipoxygenase inhibitory activities.</p>
