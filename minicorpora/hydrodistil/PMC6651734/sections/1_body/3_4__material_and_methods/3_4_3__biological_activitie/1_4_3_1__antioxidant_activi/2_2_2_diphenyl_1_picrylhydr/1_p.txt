0: The free radical scavenging activity [ 43] was determined in triplicate according to [ 48] with slight modifications in concentrations [ 49, 50].
1: Briefly, 0.5 mL of the essential oils at four concentrations (25, 50, 75, and 100 g/mL) in methanol was added to 1 mL of a stable solution of DPPH (0.06 mM, methanol) [ 50].
2: The mixture was vortexed for about 1 min and then incubated at room temperature in the dark for 30 min.
3: Absorbance was measured at 517 nm in a spectrophotometer Ultrospec 7000 UVvisible, dual beam spectrophotometer (GE Healthcare, Cambridge, UK).
4: Trolox (Sigma, Darmstadt, Germany) was used as a standard (a positive control) under the same conditions.
5: All tests were performed in triplicate.
6: The scavenging activity of essential oils on DPPH radicals was calculated as DPPH (%) inhibition using the following equation: % Inhibition = ((Ab  Aa)/Ab)  100  (1)Ab = absorbance of the blank sample.Aa = absorbance of the test sample.
