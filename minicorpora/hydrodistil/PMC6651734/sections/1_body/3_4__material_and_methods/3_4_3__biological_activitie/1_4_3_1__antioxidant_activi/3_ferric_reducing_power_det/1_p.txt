0: The reducing power of essential oils and the standard (Trolox) was evaluated as described by Singleton and Hseu [ 51, 52].
1: In brief, a 1 mL sample at four concentrations (25, 50, 75, and 100 g/mL) (in triplicate for each concentration) and prepared in methanol was mixed with phosphate buffer (1 mL, 0.2 M, pH = 6.6) and 1% potassium ferricyanide [K 3Fe(CN) 6] solution (1 mL) and incubated at 50 C for 20 min.
2: Afterwards, trichloroacetic acid (TCA) (1 mL, 10%  v/v) was added to the solution, which was then centrifuged for 10 min at 3000  g. The recovered supernatant was mixed with distilled water (1.5 mL) and 0.1%  v/v FeCl 3 (150 L).
3: The absorbance of the resulting solution was then measured at 700 nm [ 53].
4: An increase in absorbance (when compared to the blank) indicates an increase in the reducing power.
5: Absorbance due to the essential oils themselves (at the different concentrations) was systematically subtracted for each assay.
