<p>The free radical scavenging activity [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-24-02445" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] was determined in triplicate according to [
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-24-02445" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] with slight modifications in concentrations [
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-24-02445" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-24-02445" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Briefly, 0.5 mL of the essential oils at four concentrations (25, 50, 75, and 100 µg/mL) in methanol was added to 1 mL of a stable solution of DPPH (0.06 mM, methanol) [
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-24-02445" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The mixture was vortexed for about 1 min and then incubated at room temperature in the dark for 30 min. Absorbance was measured at 517 nm in a spectrophotometer Ultrospec 7000 UV–visible, dual beam spectrophotometer (GE Healthcare, Cambridge, UK). Trolox (Sigma, Darmstadt, Germany) was used as a standard (a positive control) under the same conditions. All tests were performed in triplicate. The scavenging activity of essential oils on DPPH radicals was calculated as DPPH (%) inhibition using the following equation:
 <disp-formula>% Inhibition = ((Ab − Aa)/Ab) × 100
  <label>(1)</label>
 </disp-formula>
 <disp-formula>Ab = absorbance of the blank sample.</disp-formula>
 <disp-formula>Aa = absorbance of the test sample.</disp-formula>
