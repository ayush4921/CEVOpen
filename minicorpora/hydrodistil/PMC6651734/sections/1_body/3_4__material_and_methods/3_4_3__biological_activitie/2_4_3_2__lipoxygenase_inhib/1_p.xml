<p>The in vitro lipoxygenase inhibitory activity of essential oils was determined by measuring the inhibition power of essential oils on lipoxygenase activity (EC 1.13.11.12). The spectrophotometric method described by Lyckander and Malterud (1992) was used with some minor modifications. Briefly, a reaction mixture containing essential oils in various concentrations (100, 75, 50, and 25 µg/mL of methanol) (in triplicate for each concentration), lipoxygenase (Sigma, Darmstadt, Germany), and 35 µL (0.1 mg/mL) of a 0.2 M borate buffer solution (pH = 9.0) was incubated for 15 min at 25 °C. The reaction was then initiated by addition of 35 µL of a substrate solution (linoleic acid 250 µM) and the absorbance was measured at 234 nm. Quercetin (Sigma) was used as a standard inhibitor at the same concentration as the essential oils [

 <xref rid="B56-molecules-24-02445" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The inhibition percentage of lipoxygenase activity was calculated as follows:
 <disp-formula>Inhibition percentage (%) = 100 × (OD
  <sub>blank</sub> − OD
  <sub>sample</sub>)/OD
  <sub>blank</sub>
  <label>(2)</label>
 </disp-formula> where OD
 <sub>blank</sub> is the Optical Density (OD) of the reaction media without the essential oil, and OD
 <sub>sample</sub> is the OD of the reaction media with the essential oil minus the OD value of the diluted essential oil (to compensate for absorbance due to the essential oils themselves).
