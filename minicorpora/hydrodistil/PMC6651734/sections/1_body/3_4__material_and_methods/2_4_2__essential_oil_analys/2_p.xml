<p>GC-MS was carried out using an Agilent GC system 7890B (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) fitted with a split-splitless injector and coupled to an Agilent MSD 5977B detector. One microliter of 0.01% essential oil solution was injected, and the analytical conditions were fixed as follows: injection mode: splitless at 300 °C; HP-5MS capillary column (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) (30 m × 0.25 mm, df = 0.25 µm); temperature program: from 50 °C (1 min) to 300 °C (5 min) at a rate of 5 °C/min. The carrier gas was helium at a flow rate of 1.2 mL/min. The mass spectra were recorded in Electron Ionization mode at 70 eV (scanned mass range: 40–400

The main components were confirmed by comparison of their retention and MS spectrum data with co-injected pure references (Sigma, Darmstadt, Germany) when commercially available.
