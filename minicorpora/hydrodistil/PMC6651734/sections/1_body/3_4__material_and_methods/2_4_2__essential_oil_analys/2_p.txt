0: GC-MS was carried out using an Agilent GC system 7890B (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) fitted with a split-splitless injector and coupled to an Agilent MSD 5977B detector.
1: One microliter of 0.01% essential oil solution was injected, and the analytical conditions were fixed as follows: injection mode: splitless at 300 C; HP-5MS capillary column (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) (30 m  0.25 mm, df = 0.25 m); temperature program: from 50 C (1 min) to 300 C (5 min) at a rate of 5 C/min.
2: The carrier gas was helium at a flow rate of 1.2 mL/min.
3: The mass spectra were recorded in Electron Ionization mode at 70 eV (scanned mass range: 40400  m/z).
4: The source and quadrupole temperatures were fixed at 230 C and 150 C, respectively.
5: The component identification was performed on the basis of chromatographic retention indices (RI) and by comparison of the recorded spectra with a computed data library (Pal 600K) [ 43].
6: RI values were measured on an HP-5MS column (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA).
7: RI calculations were performed in temperature program mode according to [ 44, 45, 46, 47, 48]; a mixture of homologues n-alkanes (C7C30) was used under the same chromatographic conditions.
8: The main components were confirmed by comparison of their retention and MS spectrum data with co-injected pure references (Sigma, Darmstadt, Germany) when commercially available.
