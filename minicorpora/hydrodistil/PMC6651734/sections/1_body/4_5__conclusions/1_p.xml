<p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of 
 <italic>Z. psammophilum</italic> and 
 <italic>Z. mezoneurispinosum</italic>, two species endemic to Côte d’Ivoire, as a source of therapeutic molecules for use in traditional medicine or other applications. The results showed that the essential oils isolated from these plants contain interesting molecules and display some good and previously unknown biological properties. Although the essential oils exhibited only moderate antioxidant activities, all isolated oils displayed elevated lipoxygenase inhibitory activities. Essential oils isolated from these plants could, therefore, be used in traditional medicine, given this interesting property. However, subsequent studies on these oils should take into account the plant’s age and the harvesting season to better understand their impact on the oils’ composition and biological properties. Moreover, the chemical characterization of these oils led to the identification of molecules that potentially have other biological activities, such as antimicrobial properties. Hence, it could be interesting to test the antimicrobial activity of these essential oils as plant extracts are increasingly being used in therapeutics to control multi-resistant organisms [

The use of these newly described essential oils would, of course, require an extensive study of their cytotoxicity before application in human or animal care. The insecticidal activity of these essential oils could also represent another potential source of valorization, as the plant protection sector is always searching for new bio-based active compounds to replace conventional insecticides. Perfumers are also avid for new scents for their creations, which may constitute a high added-value valorization for these newly described essential oils.
