0: Power consumption was 500 W and 1400 W for SFME and hydrodistillation methods, respectively.
1: The energy consumption and CO 2 emission were calculated according to previous literature as energy consumption (kWh) = Pt/1000 and to obtain 1 kWh from the combustion of coal or fossil fuel, and 800 g of CO 2 will be emitted into the atmosphere [ 18 20].
