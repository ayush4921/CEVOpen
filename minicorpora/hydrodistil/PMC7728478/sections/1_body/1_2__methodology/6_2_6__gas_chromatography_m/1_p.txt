0: The essential oils extracted were separately analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (Agilent 6890 GC, coupled to an Agilent 5975 mass spectrometric detector).
1: Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was combined with a chromatography column HP-5.5% phenylmethylsiloxane, with 30 m length, 0.32 mm film thickness, 0.25  m internal diameter.
2: The injection port was held at 230C, while the interface was at 280C.
3: The temperature was set from 50C to 280C at 10C per minute, using helium as the carrier gas.
