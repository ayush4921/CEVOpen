<p>Some conventional methods used for the extraction of essential oils are hydrodistillation, steam distillation, Microwave-Assisted Extraction (MAE), and solvent extraction. Although these techniques have been used over time, they have some limitations such as longer time of extraction, low extraction effectiveness, reduced oil quality due to degradation of unsaturated or ester compounds through thermal or hydrolytic effects, and negative impacts on the environment [
