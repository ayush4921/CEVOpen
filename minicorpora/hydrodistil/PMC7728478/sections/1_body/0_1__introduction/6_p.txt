0: The solvent-free microwave extraction (SFME) set up is referred to as a green technology which involves a combination of heat from the microwave and dry distillation at atmospheric pressure [ 11].
1: It is a sustainable extraction method which relies on reduced energy consumption, ensuring a safe and high quality end product [ 12].
2: It involves heating the fresh plant material in a microwave reactor, devoid of water or any solvent at all for 30 min.
3: The short-term heating of the water in the plant material expands the plant cells causing the plant cells and oil producing glands to release the oil from the plant material [ 9].
4: SFME method has widely been employed in the extraction of oils from  Melalaica leucadendra L. [ 13],  Ocimum basilicum L. [ 14],  Kananga odorata [ 15],  Pogostemon cabin [ 16],  Cuminumcyminum L. and  Zanthoxylum bungeanum Maxim [ 17], and many others.
5: However, until now, there has been no studies on the comparison of the quality and yield of essential oils obtained from  H. arborescens leaves using hydrodistillation and SFME methods.
6: This work is therefore aimed at making a comparative study in terms of extraction yields and chemical compositions of essential oils obtained from  H. arborescens leaves using hydrodistillation and solvent-free microwave extraction methods.
