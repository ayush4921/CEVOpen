 <p>Laurel (
  <italic>Laurus nobilis</italic> L.) is a plant species from Lauraceae family, and is native to the Mediterranean region. The goal of this study was to compare chemical composition of laurel leaves and antibacterial activity of its essential oil (EO) from wild-grown trees in Greece and Georgia. The laurel leaves from the two native habitats had dissimilar concentrations of phenolic acids. Of the conjugated flavonols and flavons, kaempferol (1981.3 μg/g) and apigenin (1433.6 μg/g) were the major representatives in the leaves from Greece, while luteolin (839.1 μg/g) and kaempferol (688.1 μg/g) were the major ones in the leaves from Georgia, respectively. The EO content was 1.42% and 4.54% in the leaves from Greece and Georgia, respectively. The main EO constituents of the Greek laurel plants were 1,8-cineole (30.8%), 
  <italic>α</italic>-terpinyl acetate (14.9%), 
  <italic>α</italic>-terpineol (8.0%), sabinene (7.9%), and terpinen-4-ol (6.0%). The main EO constituents of the Georgian laurel plants were 1,8-cineole (29.2%), 
  <italic>α</italic>-terpinyl acetate (22.6%), sabinene (12.2%), and methyleugenol (8.1%). The EO antimicrobial activities against 20 microorganisms were determined. Among the Gram-positive bacteria, the 
  <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> strain was the most sensitive, followed by 
  <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> ATCC 6538. Among the 
  <italic>Candida</italic> species, 
  <italic>C. albicans</italic> ATCC 10231 was the most sensitive to the laurel leaf EOs.
