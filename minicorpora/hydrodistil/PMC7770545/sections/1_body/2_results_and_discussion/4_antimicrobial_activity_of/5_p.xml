<p id="p0150">The antimicrobial activity of the tested EOs in this study was comparable to the activity of the antibacterial antibiotic ciprofloxacin and antimycotic fluconazole with the exception of the EO activity against 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spp. The different antimicrobial resistance of both types of bacteria was probably due to the different structure and chemical composition of the cell wall of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Indeed, the so-called “
 <italic>external membrane</italic>”, which is typical for Gram-negative bacteria, could prevent or delay the diffusion of the EO extract from the nutritive medium through the cell wall and membrane into the cytoplasm.
