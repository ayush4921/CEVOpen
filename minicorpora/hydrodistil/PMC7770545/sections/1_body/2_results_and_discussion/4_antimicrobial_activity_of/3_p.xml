<p id="p0140">Among the Gram-positive bacteria, the strain belonging to 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic> was the most sensitive, followed by 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCC 6538, whereas 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> NCTC 11994 was the most resistant. Among the species belonging to the 
 <italic>Candida</italic> genus, 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> was the most sensitive and 
 <italic>C. glabrata</italic> was the most resistant to the tested laurel leaf EOs. Also, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> were resistant to the tested EO samples. 
 <italic>S. flexneri</italic> and 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> were resistant to the EOs. Overall, the Gram-positive bacteria and yeasts were more sensitive to the tested EOs in comparison with the Gram-negative bacteria, which is in agreement previous reports (
