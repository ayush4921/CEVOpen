<p id="p0145">In general, the laurel leaf EO from Georgia demonstrated weaker inhibitory activity. The difference in the antimicrobial activities of the tested EO samples was most probably due to the differences in their chemical composition. The content of oxygenated monoterpenes in the two oils was different; e.g. 1,8 cineole, 
 <italic>α-</italic>terpinyl acetate, 
 <italic>α</italic>-terpineol, terpinen-4 ol, 
 <italic>etc.,</italic> and the presence of these compounds may explain the antimicrobial activity of EOs (
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Griffin et al., 1999</xref>). Antimicrobial activity of 1,8-cineole, which is the most abundand component of both laurel EOs was also studied. Pure 1,8-cineole demonstrated weaker antimicrobial activity in comparison with EOs, which means that antimicrobial activity of laurel EOs could not be attributed only to the dominant compound but the additional effect of some minor compounds as well as synergistic effects may have played a role.
