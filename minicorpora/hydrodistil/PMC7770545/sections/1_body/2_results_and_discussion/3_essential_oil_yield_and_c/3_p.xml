<p id="p0105">The EO content of the Greek laurel leaves was 1.42 ± 0.01% (v/w), whereas the EO content of the Georgian laurel leaves was 4.54 ± 0.04% (v/w). The EO content of laurel leaves was similar to that in some literature reports but different from other reports, most probably due to environmental and genotypic differences. Previous studies reported that the EO content of dried laurel leaves was 0.2% to 4.3% (
