<p id="p0120">Thirty-three constituents, or 97.8% of the total oil were identified in the Georgian laurel EO. Eleven of these EO constituents were in concentrations over 1%. The major ones in the Georgian laurel EO were: 1,8-cineole (29.2%), 
 <italic>α-</italic>terpinyl acetate (22.6%), sabinene (12.2%), methyleugenol (8.1%), 
 <italic>α-</italic>pinene (5.5%), linalool (3.7%), and 
 <italic>β-</italic>pinene (3.7%). Some of the differences in the chemical composition of the laurel leaf EOs in this study and in some reports may be due to environmental and genetic factors.
