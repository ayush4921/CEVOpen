<p id="p0090">In this study, twelve phenolic acids were quantified in the laurel leaves (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Overall, the results showed significant differences in the free and conjugated phenolic acid content, which was determinated after acid hydrolysis. In the laurel leaves from Greece, in the hydroxycinnamic acid derivates, sinapic (607.7 μg/g), caffeic (586.1 μg/g), and ferulic (300.1 μg/g) acids were the major free phenolic acids, while ferulic (2193.0 μg/g), sinapic (560.4 μg/g), and cinnamic (486.2 μg/g) acids were the major conjugated acids. The major free hydroxybenzoic acid derivates were syringic (242.0 μg/g) and salicylic (207.3 μg/g) acids, while vanillic acid (83.9 μg/g) was the major conjugated acid. Kaempferol (1981.3 μg/g) and apigenin (1433.6 μg/g) were the major representatives of the group of conjugated flavonols and flavons, respectively. In the group of quercetin glycosides only the free form of rutin and hyperoside in the Greek leaves was identified. In the laurel leaves from Georgia, 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid (45.3 μg/g) was the major free phenolic acid in the group of the hydroxycinnamic acid derivates, while sinapic (1513.9 μg/g), caffeic (789.3 μg/g), and cinnamic (513.4 μg/g) acids were the major conjugated acids. In the group of the hydroxybenzoic acid derivates the dominnat was syringic acid (789.1 μg/g). Luteolin (839.1 μg/g) and kaempferol (688.1 μg/g) were the major constituents of the group of conjugated flavonols and flavons, respectively. The derivates of the group of conjugated cinnamic acids were the dominant compounds in the Georgian leaves, while the level of flavonols and flavons was lower (
