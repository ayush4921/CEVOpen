<p id="p0095">The observed differences in the polyphenol composition of the samples from the two countries can be explained by the different environmental conditions at the two collection sites. Mount Athos on the Athos peninsula (Greece) is on the Aegean coast, and the village of Meria in Western Georgia is near the Black Sea. The long-term average annual precipitation at the sampling site in Greece (Hilandar on Mount Athos) is 474 mm. At that location, the average temperature in July is 25 °C, while the one in January is 8 °C. Also, most of the precipitation occurs in December, with an average of 80 mm of rain. On the other hand, the climate at the sampling location in Western Georgia, around the village of Meria, is warm, humid, mild, and temperate. The weather station at Ozurgeti, Georgia (around 10 km from the collection site at Meria) has long-term average annual precipitation of 1981 mm, with average temperature in August of 22.7 °C, and average temperature inf January of 5.0 °C. In general, the results reported here showed that climatic differences in both regions caused significant differences in leaf polyphenols. Therefore, our results are in agreement with previous literature reports on other plants, which are cultivated in different geographic regions (
