0: The essential oil (EO) content of laurel leaves has been reported to range between 0.2% and 4.3% depending on the location, harvesting time, and EO extraction type and conditions (e.g.
1: hydrodistillation or steam distillation) ( Abu-Dahab et al., 2014;  Bahmanzadegan et al., 2015;  El et al., 2014;  Fidan et al., 2019;  Shokoohinna et al., 2014;  Vasundhara et al., 2016).
2: Previous research has shown that up to 270 EO constituents may be found in laurel leaves, the major ones being 1,8-cineole (2256%), linalool (0.926.9%),  -terpinyl acetate (4.518.2%),  -pinene (2.215.9%),  -pinene (1.915.3%), sabinene (4.512.7%),  -terpineol (0.912.0%), terpineol-4 (0.94.1%) ( Abu-Dahab et al., 2014;  Bahmanzadegan et al., 2015;  Chahal et al., 2017;  El et al., 2014;  Fidan et al., 2019;  Goudjil et al., 2015;  Shokoohinna et al., 2014;  Vasundhara et al., 2016).
3: Similarly to other EO-containing plants, the composition of laurel leaf EO has been shown to vary significantly as a function of the environment, genotype, and the type and duration of the distillation process ( Abu-Dahab et al., 2014;  Bahmanzadegan et al., 2015;  Chahal et al., 2017;  El et al., 2014;  Fidan et al., 2019;  Goudjil et al., 2015;  Shokoohinna et al., 2014;  Vasundhara et al., 2016).
4: A recent retrospective on  L. nobilis chemistry and biological activities of its EO was published by  Chahal et al.
5: (2017).
6: In addition, laurel leaf EO has exhibited antimicrobial and antioxidant activities ( Bahmanzadegan et al., 2015;  Caputo et al., 2017;  Dias et al., 2014;  El et al., 2014;  Fidan et al., 2019).
