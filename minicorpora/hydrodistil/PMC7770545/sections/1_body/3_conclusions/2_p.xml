<p id="p0170">This study found significant dissimilarities in the chemical profile of laurel leaf EOs from Greece and Georgia. Derivates of hydroxycinnamic and hydroxybenzoic acids, flavonols and flavons dominated in the laurel leaves from Greece, whereas the dominant compounds in the Georgian leaves were the group of conjugated cinnamic acids. The main group of constituents in the EOs from Greek and Georgian laurel leaves was composed of the oxygen monoterpenes 1,8-cineole, 
 <italic>α-</italic>terpinyl acetate, 
 <italic>α</italic>-terpineol, and terpinen-4-ol. The EOs demonstrated antimicrobial activity against pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms. Laurel plants from Greece and Georgia show promise as a new source of laurel leaves for the international spice market.
