<p id="p0030">Leaves from 
 <italic>L. nobilis</italic> L. were collected only from wild growing trees, from one location per country. Subsamples were generated from 10 different trees per location by sampling leaves at different height and exposure within a tree. The leaves were harvested at the end of vegetation, during the formation of fruits. The leaves were collected in October 2016 from the Athos peninsula on a land belonging to the Bulgarian monastery (North Greece, at 160 m elev., 40°09′26″N and 24°19′35″E) and in December 2016 from the province of Meria (West Georgia, at 200 m elev., 41° 56′ 27″ N 41° 53′ 45″ E).
