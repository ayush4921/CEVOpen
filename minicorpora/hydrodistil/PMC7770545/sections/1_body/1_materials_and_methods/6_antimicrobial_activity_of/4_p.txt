0: The antibacterial activity of the EOs was assessed according to the Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI) reference method for antimicrobial disk susceptibility tests ( CLSI, M2-A9 2006;  CLS, M7-A7 2006).
1: The anticandidal activity of the EOs was assessed according to the CLSI reference method for antifungal disk diffusion susceptibility testing of yeast ( CLSI, M27-A3 2008;  CLSI, M44-A2 2009).
2: The used filter paper discs (Whatman No1) in disc diffusion test were prepared by soaking with 10 L of the tested essential oil samples.
3: 1,8-Cineole represents about 30% of the total oil content and the filter paper discs were prepared by soaking with 3 L of the 1,8-cineole.
4: The used positive controls of reference antibiotic discs Ciprofloxacin (5 g/disc) and antimycotic Fluconazole (25 g/disc) were purchased by HiMedia (India).
5: The antimicrobial activity of the EOs and 1,8-cineole determined by disc diffusion tests was expressed as inhibitory zone (IZ) diameter in mm; these zones were measured to the nearest millimeter using an antibiotic zone scale.
6: The antimicrobial activities of CPH and FLC were also determined as positive controls.
