 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">CLSI, M44-A2 2009</xref>). The used filter paper discs (Whatman №1) in disc diffusion test were prepared by soaking with 10 μL of the tested essential oil samples. 1,8-Cineole represents about 30% of the total oil content and the filter paper discs were prepared by soaking with 3 μL of the 1,8-cineole. The used positive controls of reference antibiotic discs Ciprofloxacin (5 μg/disc) and antimycotic Fluconazole (25 μg/disc) were purchased by HiMedia (India). The antimicrobial activity of the EOs and 1,8-cineole determined by disc diffusion tests was expressed as inhibitory zone (IZ) diameter in mm; these zones were measured to the nearest millimeter using an antibiotic zone scale. The antimicrobial activities of CPH and FLC were also determined as positive controls.
