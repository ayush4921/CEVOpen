0: A GC analysis was carried out using an Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph, HP-5 column MS (30 m  250 m x 0.25 m), temperature: 35 C/3 min, 5 C/min to 250 C for 3 min, 49 min in total, helium as carrier gas, 1 ml/min constant speed, 30:1 split ratio.
1: A gas chromatographymass spectrometric (GC/MS) analysis was performed on an Agilent 5975C mass spectrometer, helium as carrier gas, column and temperature the same as in the GC analysis.
2: The identification of the chemical constituents was made by comparison to their retention time and library data ( Adams, 2007; NIST 08 database; own libraries).
3: Components were listed according to their retention (Kovat's) indices, calculated using a standard calibration mixture of C 8 - C 40 n-alkanes in n-hexane.
4: Compound concentration was computed as percentage of the total ion current (TIC).
