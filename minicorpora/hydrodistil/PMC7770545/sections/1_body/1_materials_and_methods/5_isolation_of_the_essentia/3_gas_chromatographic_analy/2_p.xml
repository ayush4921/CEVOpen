<p id="p0060">A GC analysis was carried out using an Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph, HP-5 column MS (30 m × 250 μm x 0.25 μm), temperature: 35 °C/3 min, 5 °C/min to 250 °C for 3 min, 49 min in total, helium as carrier gas, 1 ml/min constant speed, 30:1 split ratio. A gas chromatography–mass spectrometric (GC/MS) analysis was performed on an Agilent 5975C mass spectrometer, helium as carrier gas, column and temperature the same as in the GC analysis. The identification of the chemical constituents was made by comparison to their retention time and library data (
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Adams, 2007</xref>; NIST 08 database; own libraries). Components were listed according to their retention (Kovat's) indices, calculated using a standard calibration mixture of C
 <sub>8</sub> - C
 <sub>40</sub> n-alkanes in n-hexane. Compound concentration was computed as percentage of the total ion current (TIC).
