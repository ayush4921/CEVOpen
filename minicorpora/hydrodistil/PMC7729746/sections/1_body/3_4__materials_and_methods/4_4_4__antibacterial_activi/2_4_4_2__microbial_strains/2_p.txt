0: Seven  H. pylori (HP) strains were selected from a collection of clinical isolates from the Laboratorio Patogenesis Microbiana, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Diego Portales, Santiago, Chile.
1: The HP strains were routinely cultured on 1.5% Brucella agar (from BD, USA) supplemented with 57% horse blood and DENT cocktail diluted 1:200 and were incubated for 37 days under microaerophilic conditions (10% CO 2) and 95% humidity at 37 C. The  HP strains were confirmed by colony morphology, Gram staining, the urease test (He-Py Test, GrupoBios, Chile) and positive PCR using primers for the  H. pylori-specific  hpaA gene, which has been previously described (Bergozelli et al., 2003).
2: HP strain HPK5 was used as a pathogen reference [ 47, 48].
