0: The agar disk diffusion technique has been widely used to assay plant extracts for antimicrobial activity.
1: In this method, 6 mm sterilized filter paper disks (Whatman  No 1) were saturated with 10 L of filter-sterilized oil plant extract.
2: The impregnated discs were then placed onto the surface of a suitable solid agar medium, such as Mueller Hinton BD .
3: The media was pre-inoculated with test organisms.
4: A standard inoculum size of 1  10 8 CFU/mL of bacteria was used to inoculate the diffusion plates, which is equal to the McFarland 0.5 turbidity standard.
5: The plates were incubated overnight at 37 C, and the diameter of the inhibition zone around each disk (diameter of inhibition zone plus diameter of the disk) was measured in millimeters.
6: A Sensydisc was used as a positive control for Gram+ and Gram strains Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) [ 48].
