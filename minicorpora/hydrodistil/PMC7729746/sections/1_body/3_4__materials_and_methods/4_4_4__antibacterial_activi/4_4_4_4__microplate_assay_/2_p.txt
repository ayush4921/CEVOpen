0: To enhance EO solubility, they were dissolved in 2% ( v/ v) dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) Merck  (this amount does not affect bacterial growth) and then added to the microplates.
1: The inoculated microplates were incubated as described above for agar plates, but for only 1 day.
2: ELISA (Tecan) readings at 600 nm were recorded to calculate the MIC values as described by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute [ 48, 49] protocol.
3: Control microplates of bacteria without the EO and without bacteria were also included in these assays.
4: To identify significant differences between treated and untreated groups, data comparison by the ANOVA test was performed using the GraphPad Prism 5 program.
