0: The CA and LS essential oils were prepared at concentrations of 0.39, 0.78, 1.56, 3.12, 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 50.0 mg/mL and placed in a final volume of 100 L in 96-well plates.
1: The control assays were performed with M9 and 1% DMSO Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).
2: Ten individuals of  C. elegans/well were used in each trial.
3: The plates were incubated (incubator Binder KT) at 20 C for 24 and 48 h. The experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated twice.
4: After incubation at 20 C, all the nematodes were counted at 24 and 48 h to determine their survival.
5: They were considered alive if they showed some type of motility and were considered dead when they showed no movement, either from their tail, head or pharynx, after 5 s of observation (Stereo Microscope Leica MZ12).
6: The count was performed to establish the degree of mortality [ 51].
