0: The N2 wild-type strain of  C. elegans was used to investigate toxicity.
1: The nematodes were maintained on nematode growth medium (NGM) agar plates, with an established layer of the  E. coli OP50 strain.
2: The plates were maintained at 20 C for 3 days.
3: The gravid nematodes were collected and treated for 5 min in a chlorine solution (0.45 N NaOH, 2% HOCl Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA)) to isolate eggs.
4: The eggs were placed in plates with OP50; once hatched they were left for 3 days to obtain synchronized adult nematodes.
5: These were collected in M9 saline solution (1.5 g KH 2PO 4, 3 g Na 2HPO 4, 2.5 g NaCl, 0.5 mL of 1 M MgSO 4 Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) and distilled water for a final volume of 500 mL) [ 50].
