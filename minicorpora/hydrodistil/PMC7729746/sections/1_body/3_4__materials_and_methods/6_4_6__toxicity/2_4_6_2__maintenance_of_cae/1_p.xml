<p>The N2 wild-type strain of 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> was used to investigate toxicity. The nematodes were maintained on nematode growth medium (NGM) agar plates, with an established layer of the 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 strain. The plates were maintained at 20 Â°C for 3 days. The gravid nematodes were collected and treated for 5 min in a chlorine solution (0.45 N NaOH, 2% HOCl Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA)) to isolate eggs. The eggs were placed in plates with OP50; once hatched they were left for 3 days to obtain synchronized adult nematodes. These were collected in M9 saline solution (1.5 g KH
