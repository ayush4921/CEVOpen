0: The human epithelial mammary cell lines MCF10A (non-tumoral) and MCF7 (tumoral) and the human epithelial renal cell lines HK-2 (non-tumoral), 786-O and ACHN (tumoral) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD).
1: Glioblastoma cell lines U87GM and Primary human fibroblasts.
2: The cells were cultured in Dulbeccos Modified Eagles F-12 Medium (DMEM-F12; Gibco, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco, USA) and maintained at 37 C in 5% of CO 2 atmosphere.
3: When the cells reach the 80% of confluence were replicated.
4: The numbers of generations of the cell lines were about 510.
5: In vitro assays were performed in triplicate of three independent experiments for each cell line.
