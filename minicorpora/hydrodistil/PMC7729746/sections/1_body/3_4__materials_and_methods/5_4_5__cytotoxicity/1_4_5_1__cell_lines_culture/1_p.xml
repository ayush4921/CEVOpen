<p>The human epithelial mammary cell lines MCF10A (non-tumoral) and MCF7 (tumoral) and the human epithelial renal cell lines HK-2 (non-tumoral), 786-O and ACHN (tumoral) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD). Glioblastoma cell lines U87GM and Primary human fibroblasts. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s F-12 Medium (DMEM-F12; Gibco, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco, USA) and maintained at 37 °C in 5% of CO
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere. When the cells reach the 80% of confluence were replicated. The numbers of generations of the cell lines were about 5–10. In vitro assays were performed in triplicate of three independent experiments for each cell line.
