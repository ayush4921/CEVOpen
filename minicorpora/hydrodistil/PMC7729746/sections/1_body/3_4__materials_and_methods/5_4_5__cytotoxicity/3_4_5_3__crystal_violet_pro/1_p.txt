0: To evaluate the dose-response at given concentrations and the time-course of Eos, the cells where detached with Trypsin-EDTA 0.5% (Gibco, USA) and 5  10 3 cells/well were seeded and incubated in a 96-well cell plate with DMEM-F12 supplemented with 10% FBS for 24 h. The supernatant were removed and the cells were washed 1 with PBS 1X (Gibco, USA), and treated with EOs extracts of CA or LS at known concentrations (64, 32, 16, 8, 4, or 2 g/mL) dissolved in culture medium (DMEM-F12 supplemented with 1% FBS).
1: The vehicle was DMSO 1% dissolved in DMEM-F12, supplemented with 1% FBS as a control treatment (the EOs are dissolved in DMSO 1%).
2: After 24 or 48 h the supernatant was discarded, the cells were washed with PBS 1X and incubated with 100 l of crystal violet (CV) solution (0.2%  w/ v in ethanol 10%) (Gibco, USA) for 20 min, then the CV solution was removed and Na 2HPO 4 (0.1 M, pH 4.5, in ethanol 50:50  v/ v) (SIGMA, USA), was added to elute the intra-cellular colorant.
3: The absorbance of each sample was measured at 570 nm.
4: The results are shown as percentage of color intensity and normalized to cells grown in DMSO 1% as control treatment.
