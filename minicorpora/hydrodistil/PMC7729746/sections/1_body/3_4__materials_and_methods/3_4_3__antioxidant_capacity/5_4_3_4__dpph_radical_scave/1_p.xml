<p>The quantitative measurement of the EOs radical scavenging properties was carried out by the following methodology [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-25-05600" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. A 0.2 mM solution of DPPH in methanol was prepared, and 70 μL of this solution was added to 20 μL of EO (0–1000 μg/mL). Trolox at concentrations of 0–1000 μg/mL was used as a reference antioxidant. Discoloration of reaction mixture was measured at 517 nm after incubation for 30 min. The results were expressed as IC
 <sub>50</sub> values (concentration of EO in μg/mL required to inhibit 50% of DPPH radical present in solution). The analyses were carried out in triplicate.
