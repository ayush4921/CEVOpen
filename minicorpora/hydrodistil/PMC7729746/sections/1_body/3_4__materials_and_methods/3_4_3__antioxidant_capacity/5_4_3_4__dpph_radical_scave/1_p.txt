0: The quantitative measurement of the EOs radical scavenging properties was carried out by the following methodology [ 16].
1: A 0.2 mM solution of DPPH in methanol was prepared, and 70 L of this solution was added to 20 L of EO (01000 g/mL).
2: Trolox at concentrations of 01000 g/mL was used as a reference antioxidant.
3: Discoloration of reaction mixture was measured at 517 nm after incubation for 30 min.
4: The results were expressed as IC 50 values (concentration of EO in g/mL required to inhibit 50% of DPPH radical present in solution).
5: The analyses were carried out in triplicate.
