0: The FRAP assay was carried out with the following method [ 44].
1: The FRAP reagent consisted of 300 mM acetate buffer pH 3.6, 10 mM 2,4,6- tris-(2-pyridyl)-s-triazine (TPTZ) solution in 40 mM HCl, and 20 mM FeCl 36H 2O aqueous solution at a ratio of 10:1:1 ( v/ v).
2: The EOs were prepared at a final concentration of 500 g/mL.
3: The extract solution (10 L) was mixed with 70 L of freshly prepared FRAP solution and incubated at 37 C for 30 min.
4: The absorbance of the solutions was measured at 593 nm.
5: Trolox was used as the standard solution to construct a calibration curve over a concentration range of 0500 g/mL.
6: The FRAP results were expressed as mg of Trolox equivalent per mL of EO.
7: All experiments were performed in triplicate.
