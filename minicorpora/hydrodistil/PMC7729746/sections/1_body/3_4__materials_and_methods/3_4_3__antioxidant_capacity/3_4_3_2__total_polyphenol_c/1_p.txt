0: The TPC method was based on the 96-well microplate FolinCiocalteu method and adapted from [ 12].
1: A 20 L sample of the diluted EO (500 g/mL) was mixed with 100 L of 10% ( v/ v) Folin-Ciocalteu reagent and shaken.
2: The mixture was left for 5 min, and then 80 L of sodium carbonate solution (700 mM) was added, and the mixture was shaken for 1 min.
3: After 60 min at room temperature, the absorbance was measured at 765 nm using a microplate reader.
4: Gallic acid dilutions (01000 g/mL) were used as standards for calibration.
5: The results were expressed as mg of gallic acid equivalent per ml of essential oil.
6: All experiments were performed in triplicate.
