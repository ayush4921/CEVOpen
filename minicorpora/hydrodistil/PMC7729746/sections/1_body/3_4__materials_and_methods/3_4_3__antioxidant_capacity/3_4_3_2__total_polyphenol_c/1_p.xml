<p>The TPC method was based on the 96-well microplate Folin–Ciocalteu method and adapted from [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-25-05600" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. A 20 μL sample of the diluted EO (500 μg/mL) was mixed with 100 μL of 10% (

 <italic>v</italic>) Folin-Ciocalteu reagent and shaken. The mixture was left for 5 min, and then 80 μL of sodium carbonate solution (700 mM) was added, and the mixture was shaken for 1 min. After 60 min at room temperature, the absorbance was measured at 765 nm using a microplate reader. Gallic acid dilutions (0–1000 μg/mL) were used as standards for calibration. The results were expressed as mg of gallic acid equivalent per ml of essential oil. All experiments were performed in triplicate.
