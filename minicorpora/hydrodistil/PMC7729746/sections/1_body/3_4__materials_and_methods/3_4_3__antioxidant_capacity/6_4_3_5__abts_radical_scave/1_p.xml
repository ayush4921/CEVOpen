<p>The radical scavenging capacity of the samples for ABTS radical cation was carried out by following method. ABTS was generated by mixing a 7 mM stock solution of ABTS in PBS at pH 7.4 with 2.5 mM K
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>8</sub> (final concentration) followed by storage in the dark at room temperature for 16 h before use. The mixture was diluted with PBS to give an absorbance of 0.700 ± 0.02 units at 734 nm using spectrophotometer. For each sample, diluted solution of the sample (20 μL) was allowed to react with fresh ABTS solution (180 μL), and then the absorbance was measured 6 min after initial mixing. The blank was prepared from 180 μL of solution of the ABTS in PBS and 20 μL of PBS. Trolox was used as a standard and the capacity of free radical scavenging was expressed by IC
 <sub>50</sub> (μg/mL) values calculated denote the concentration required to scavenge 50% of ABTS radicals. All measurements were performed in triplicate [
