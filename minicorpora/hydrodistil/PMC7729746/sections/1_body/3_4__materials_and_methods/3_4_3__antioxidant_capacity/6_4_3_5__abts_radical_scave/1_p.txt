0: The radical scavenging capacity of the samples for ABTS radical cation was carried out by following method.
1: ABTS was generated by mixing a 7 mM stock solution of ABTS in PBS at pH 7.4 with 2.5 mM K 2S 2O 8 (final concentration) followed by storage in the dark at room temperature for 16 h before use.
2: The mixture was diluted with PBS to give an absorbance of 0.700  0.02 units at 734 nm using spectrophotometer.
3: For each sample, diluted solution of the sample (20 L) was allowed to react with fresh ABTS solution (180 L), and then the absorbance was measured 6 min after initial mixing.
4: The blank was prepared from 180 L of solution of the ABTS in PBS and 20 L of PBS.
5: Trolox was used as a standard and the capacity of free radical scavenging was expressed by IC 50 (g/mL) values calculated denote the concentration required to scavenge 50% of ABTS radicals.
6: All measurements were performed in triplicate [ 45, 46].
