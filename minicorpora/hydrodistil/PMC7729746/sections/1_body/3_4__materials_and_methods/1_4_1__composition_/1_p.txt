0: Gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis was performed on a Varian gas chromatograph series 431 (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) fitted with a DB-5 ms fused silica capillary column (30  0.25 mm; film thickness, 0.25 m) using split/split-less injection and coupled to a series 220 mass detector (Agilent Technologies, Inc.).
1: The following conditions were used: injection volume: 0.8 L with split ratio 1:80; helium as a carrier gas at 1.5 mL/min in constant flow; injector temperature: 250 C; oven temperature: 50260 C at 2 C/min.
2: The mass spectra electron impact (EI+) mode was set at 70 eV, with an ion source temperature of 260 C. The mass spectra were recorded within a range of 40300 atomic mass units.
3: Identification of the EO constituents was accomplished based on the following: the retention index (RI) determined with respect to a homologous series of  n-alkanes (C 5C 28; PolyScience, Niles, IL, USA) under the same experimental conditions; co-injection with standards (Sigma-Aldrich) and standard isolates; identification using an MS library (NIST 05 and Wiley; NIST/EPA/NIH Mass Spectral Library with Search Program (data version NIST 11; software version 2.0 g), available online at:  http://www.nist.gov/srd/nist1a.cfm) and comparison with previously reported MS data [ 43].
