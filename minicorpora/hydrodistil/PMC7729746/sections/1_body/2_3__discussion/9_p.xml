<p>Regarding the lower MIC or bacteriolytic activity values reported against 
 <italic>H. pylori</italic> for some EOs such as 0.01% (
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) dilution for lemongrass (
 <italic>Cymbopagon citratus</italic>) oil [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-25-05600" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and the MIC value 2 µg/mL of EO from the Peruvian native plant 
 <italic>Minthostachys mollis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-25-05600" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The MCB values for carrot and lemongrass oil are 0.02 and 0.04 µg/mL respectively [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-25-05600" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. These numbers are not quite comparable given that the value described here for 
 <italic>C. alba</italic> EO 0.1%(
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) dilution and MIC = 29 µg/mL, (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05600-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) is close to the range of those oils previously mentioned as values required to block 
 <italic>H. pylori</italic> growth. This implies that CA_EO is a promising candidate to fight 
 <italic>H. pylori</italic> infections. For further comparison with other compounds also see 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05600-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. In addition to this antibacterial activity, the CA_EO has been used in, traditional medicine and an insect repellent. Other studies have verified antifungal properties against 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> sp. and 
 <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-25-05600" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] as well as activity against other fungus species [
