<p>The CA_EO was the most effective against 
 <italic>S. aureus, E. coli, C. albicans and H. pylori</italic> with inhibition zones of 25, 8, and 15 mm (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05600-f001">Figure 1</xref>) respectively. Additionally, the CA_EO showed a complete inhibition at the same concentration against 
 <italic>H. pylori</italic> and showed antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. At the same concentration antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> was slightly lower than that against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The MICs of the CA_EO against the bacteria mentioned above were 19.0, 36.0, 31.0, and 30.0 μg/mL respectively (

The chemical composition of CA_EO which is primarily composed of α-terpineol (27.96%), eucalyptol (21.63%), and β-phellandrene (14.84%). On the other hand, LS_EO which is composed by limonene (5.3%), showed strong antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>H. pylori.</italic>
