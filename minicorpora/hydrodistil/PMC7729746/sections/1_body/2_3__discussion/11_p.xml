<p>Plants are hence a potential source of drug discovery and development of cancer chemoprevention or treatment. It has been reported that they produce secondary metabolites with antitumoral effect available for the treatment of cancer patients [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-25-05600" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. We found antitumoral activity with a selective cytotoxicity of human tumor epithelial cells lines such as MCF-7 (mammary) and 786-O and ACHN (renal). The viability and proliferation were significantly affected by the treatment. Meanwhile, the EOs did not show any cytotoxic effect on non-tumor human epithelial cell lines MCF10A (mammary) and HK2 (renal). More studies, however, are necessary to carry out the anti-cancer activity of EOs and also their source of biological and chemical diversity [

Despite the new evidence that has been reported, very few studies have been carried out on the combination of EOs with chemotherapy drugs, (e.g., the association synergistic effect of Geraniol and 5-fluorouracil tested in both SW620 and Caco-2 human colon carcinoma cell lines [
