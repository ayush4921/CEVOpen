<p>The biological activity on the major monoterpenes reported for CA_EO components, has been previously described, as noted below. For instance, a study showed that a protective effect of standardized 
 <italic>Pistacia atlantica</italic> EO against ethanol-induced gastric ulcers; α-pinene being the main agent responsible for the 
 <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> antibacterial activity [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-25-05600" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In a study about several EOs (
 <italic>C. alba</italic> was not included) and their effects on 
 <italic>H. pylori</italic>, eugenol was detected in the EOs isolated from 
 <italic>Cinnamomum zeylanicum</italic> and 
 <italic>Eugenia caryophyllus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-25-05600" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Eucalyptol was also found in 
 <italic>Satureja montana</italic> and also in 
 <italic>Eucalyptus globulus</italic>. In addition to this, carvacrol (an α-terpineol isomer), was present in 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic> and 
 <italic>S.montana</italic>. Little is known regarding the mechanisms of action of these compounds. For instance, carvacrol, has a hydroxyl group with the potential capability to act as a metal chelator of transmembrane carriers for monovalent cations thus affecting membrane potential [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-25-05600" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Therefore, this compound potentially destroys the proton motive force and inhibits some enzymes and other essential macromolecules involved in this phenomenon [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-25-05600" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. With the above-described, one could associate the monoterpene α-terpineol and eucalyptol with the CA_EO antibacterial activity. With this background, the antibacterial activity could be attributed to CA_EO monoterpenes such as α-terpineol and eucalyptol.
