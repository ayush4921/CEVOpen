0: Cancer is an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide [ 2].
1: The increase of the incidence indicates that 1:8 men and 1:10 women will develop this multifactorial disease in a lifetime [ 2].
2: Due to the aforementioned, the research for alternative and complementary treatments of cancerous diseases still motivates the search for new antitumoral agents [ 3].
3: The EOs obtained from diverse plants are able to increase the efficacy of commonly used chemotherapy drugs, having also shown pro-immune functions when administered to cancer patients [ 4].
4: It has been reported that the EOs may interfere in various signaling pathways in cancerous cells and may exert anti-mutagenic, anti-proliferative, antioxidant and detoxifying effects [ 3].
5: The MCF-7 line is one of the most described cell lines in the literature for testing antitumor activity of natural bioactive products.
6: The cytotoxic effects on MCF-7 cell line treated with EOs from plants of the genus  Cryptocarya [ 5, 6] and  Laurelia [ 7] had previously been reported.
