<p>Some studies conducted on the EOs of 
 <italic>Myrcia</italic> species revealed their chemical diversity; they contained a wide range of chemicals, such as β-caryophyllene, germacrene B, δ-cadinene [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-25-00783" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], α-pinene, α-terpineol [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-25-00783" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], caryophyllene oxide, globulol, (
 <italic>E</italic>)-nerolidyl acetate, 
 <italic>ar</italic>-curcumene, δ-cadinene, and spathulenol [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-25-00783" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Studies on the species 
 <italic>Myrcia eximia</italic> DC only focused on its anatomy and taxonomy. This species, popularly known in Brazil as “goiabinha”, is geographically distributed in the northeast, midwest, and southeast regions of Brazil [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-25-00783" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-25-00783" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Apart from a small report on the existence of β-caryophyllene [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-25-00783" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], there is no literature available on the yield and chemical composition of its EO. In this context, herein, we aim to analyze the mass yield of EOs of 
 <italic>Myrcia eximia</italic> DC collected in 2017 and 2018 from the city of Magalhães Barata, northeast Pará-Brazil, Eastern Amazon. We aim to garner new information for the dissemination of knowledge related to the chemical profile of the EOs of this species.
