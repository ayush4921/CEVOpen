0: Some studies conducted on the EOs of  Myrcia species revealed their chemical diversity; they contained a wide range of chemicals, such as -caryophyllene, germacrene B, -cadinene [ 11], -pinene, -terpineol [ 12], caryophyllene oxide, globulol, ( E)-nerolidyl acetate,  ar-curcumene, -cadinene, and spathulenol [ 13].
1: Studies on the species  Myrcia eximia DC only focused on its anatomy and taxonomy.
2: This species, popularly known in Brazil as goiabinha, is geographically distributed in the northeast, midwest, and southeast regions of Brazil [ 14, 15].
3: Apart from a small report on the existence of -caryophyllene [ 16], there is no literature available on the yield and chemical composition of its EO.
4: In this context, herein, we aim to analyze the mass yield of EOs of  Myrcia eximia DC collected in 2017 and 2018 from the city of Magalhaes Barata, northeast Para-Brazil, Eastern Amazon.
5: We aim to garner new information for the dissemination of knowledge related to the chemical profile of the EOs of this species.
