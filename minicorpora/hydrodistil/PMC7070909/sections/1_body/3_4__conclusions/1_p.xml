<p>High concentrations of oxygenated sesquiterpenes were found in the EOs of 
 <italic>Myrcia eximia</italic> DC specimens collected in 2017 and 2018, among which (
 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene gained prominence in the chemical composition of both specimens. Aldehydes were responsible for the characterization of the 2018 sample (HD) oils, with emphasis on hexanal. Notably, hydrocarbon sesquiterpenes are commonly found in the chemical composition of EOs of the genus 
 <italic>Myrcia</italic>, such as (
 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene. The results of this study of 
 <italic>M. eximia</italic> can contribute to dissemination of knowledge regarding the chemical composition of this species, which is almost incipient in the literature. As noted, important molecules were identified in the 
 <italic>Myrcia eximia</italic> DC essential oil, which shows that this species can be a natural source of chemically active substances for a wide range of industrial applications.
