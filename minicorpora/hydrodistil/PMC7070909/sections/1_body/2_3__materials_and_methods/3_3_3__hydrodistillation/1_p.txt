0: Hydrodistillation was performed on a Clevenger-type apparatus [ 48, 49], using 176.29 g of the plant material collected in 2017 and 2018.
1: The extraction period was 10,800 s with a temperature of 100 C. After extraction, anhydrous sodium sulfate (Na 2SO 4) was added, and the EO was centrifuged to eliminate moisture.
2: The mass yield of the EO was calculated on dry basis (db), by relating the oil mass obtained by HD and the dry mass used in the extraction process, according to Equation (1).
3: (1)% yield oil(ww)db=  moilmsample (humidity (%)) 100.
