0: The chemical composition of the EOs was evaluated according to a reported methodology [ 51], by using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Shimadzu, QP-2010 plus system, (City Kyoto, Japan), under the following conditions: silica capillary column Rtx-5MS (30 m  0.25 mm, film thickness = 0.25 m), program temperature of 60240 C (3 C/min), injector temperature of 250 C, helium as drag gas (linear velocity of 32 cm/s, measured at 100 C), and splitless injection (1 L of a 2:1000 hexane solution).
1: Ionization was obtained by the electronic impact technique at 70 eV; the temperature of the ion source and other parts was 200 C. The volatile compounds were quantified by gas chromatography using a flame ionization detector (FID) (Shimadzu, QP 2010 system), under the same conditions as GC/MS, except that nitrogen was used as the drag gas.
2: The retention index was calculated for all the volatile constituents using a homologous series of  n-alkanes (C8C20).
3: They were identified by comparison of their mass spectra and retention indices to those reported in the literature [ 22, 52].
