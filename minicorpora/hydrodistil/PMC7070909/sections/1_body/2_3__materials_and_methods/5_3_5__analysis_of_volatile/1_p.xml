<p>The chemical composition of the EOs was evaluated according to a reported methodology [
 <xref rid="B51-molecules-25-00783" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], by using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Shimadzu, QP-2010 plus system, (City Kyoto, Japan), under the following conditions: silica capillary column Rtx-5MS (30 m × 0.25 mm, film thickness = 0.25 μm), program temperature of 60–240 °C (3 °C/min), injector temperature of 250 °C, helium as drag gas (linear velocity of 32 cm/s, measured at 100 °C), and splitless injection (1 μL of a 2:1000 hexane solution). Ionization was obtained by the electronic impact technique at 70 eV; the temperature of the ion source and other parts was 200 °C. The volatile compounds were quantified by gas chromatography using a flame ionization detector (FID) (Shimadzu, QP 2010 system), under the same conditions as GC/MS, except that nitrogen was used as the drag gas. The retention index was calculated for all the volatile constituents using a homologous series of 
 <italic>n</italic>-alkanes (C8–C20). They were identified by comparison of their mass spectra and retention indices to those reported in the literature [
