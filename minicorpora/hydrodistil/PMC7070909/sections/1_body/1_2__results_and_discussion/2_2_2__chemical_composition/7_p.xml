<p>Nonanal was identified in the EO obtained by HD of the samples collected in 2017 and 2018, with its contents being 1.28% and 3.24%, respectively. This compound was also identified in the oil extracted by SD of the 2018 sample. The presence of this substance enhances the antimicrobial activity of the EO against bacterial and fungal pathogens. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) against 
 <italic>Penicillium cyclopium</italic> were investigated [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-25-00783" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and the results demonstrated that this volatile compound could alter the fungal hyphae morphology, leading to loss in cytoplasmic material and mycelial distortion. In addition, this substance caused severe changes in the permeability of fungal cell membranes. In this study, the authors obtained MIC = 0.3 mL/L and MFC = 0.4 mL/L, demonstrating that nonanal has suitable activity against 
 <italic>P. cyclopium</italic> fungus. Zavala-SÃ¡nchez et al. [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-25-00783" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] reported the antidiarrheal activity of nonanal, which showed significant inhibitory effects in mice with diarrhea induced by castor oil, magnesium sulfate, and arachidonic acid [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-25-00783" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Nonanal was also used for alpha stimulation [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-25-00783" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], and improvement of trap performance against 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-25-00783" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].
