<p>Caryophyllene oxide was identified in the sample oil obtained by HD with contents of 10.25% and 16.31% in 2017 and 2018, respectively. When the 2018 sample was subjected to SD, caryophyllene oxide was obtained in greater quantity (22.16%). 14-Hydroxy-9-
 <italic>epi</italic>-(
 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene was also obtained from the three extractions. Its contents were 7.02% and 4.63% in the oil obtained by HD of samples collected in 2017 and 2018, respectively, and 7.84% of the EO obtained by SD of the sample collected in 2018. There are several reports in the literature on plants in which these compounds are the major components of the EOs, and these were investigated in relation to their property of inducing programmed cell death in
