<p>The samples were quantified and identified by using gas chromatography (GC) alone and gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry (GCâ€“MS). In total, 93 chemical compounds were identified, and they are listed in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-00783-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. To obtain the EO, two different techniques were used, HD and SD. For the plant material collected in 2017, EO was obtained only by HD, while, for the material collected in 2018, EO was obtained by HD and SD.
