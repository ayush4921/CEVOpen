<p>The main classes of compounds found in the sample collected in 2017 (dry season) were aldehydes (2.38%), hydrocarbon sesquiterpenes (36.21%), oxygenated sesquiterpenes (53.41%), and other compounds (0.27%), whereas, in the sample collected in 2018 (rainy season), there was large quantitative variation with respect to the classes of compounds obtained in the 2017 sample, i.e., 40.5% aldehydes, 23% hydrocarbon sesquiterpenes, and 30.5% oxygenated sesquiterpenes, as well as other compounds (0.2%), were identified. The different collection periods influenced the composition of this specimen of 
 <italic>M. eximia</italic> because the aldehyde content increased, while the contents of hydrocarbon sesquiterpenes and oxygenated sesquiterpenes decreased.
