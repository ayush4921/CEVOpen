<p>Moisture contents of 9.43% and 11.95% were obtained for leaf samples of 
 <italic>Myrcia eximia</italic> DC collected in 2017 and 2018, respectively. This variation may be related to the collection period, because the sample with the highest moisture content was that collected in the rainy season. For samples obtained by hydrodistillation (HD), yields ranged from 0.01% to 0.36% (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-00783-f001">Figure 1</xref> shows the chromatograms of the EO fractions collected in 2017 and 2018. Differences in the yields of EO fractions may be associated with the extraction technique employed. Other authors studying other plants compared the extraction methods of HD and steam distillation (SD) and reported that they can influence and induce differences in mass yields and chemical compositions at the end of the extraction process [
