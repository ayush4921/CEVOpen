<p>The yield in essential was 0.0034%. The plants from which the stems were collected were not affected by the removal of the stems and they completed their vegetative cycle and flowered in the following years. In the essential oil of 
 <italic>E. intisy</italic>, we detected 70 compounds (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-pharmaceuticals-14-00111">Figure S1</xref>) accounting 68.79% of the whole composition. Only compounds that showed mass spectral similarities ≥80% in respect to our libraries were considered [

 <xref rid="B39-pharmaceuticals-14-00111" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and NIST11. The composition was dominated by terpenoids with 48 compounds covering 37.98% of the total EO composition. Sesquiterpene alcohols and sequiterpene hydrocarbons where the classes with the higher number of compounds. Phytol and isophytol are the only diterpene, and phytol alone covers 9.55% of the whole EO composition. Mammals are generally able to use phytol, as they would do with any fatty acid, as a source of energy through its beta-oxidation [

 <xref rid="B41-pharmaceuticals-14-00111" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Recent studies on phytol have shown effects as a function of anxiolytic, metabolism modulator, cytotoxicity, antioxidant, autophagy, and induction to apoptosis, antinociceptive, anti-inflammatory, immunity modulator, and bactericide [
 <xref rid="B42-pharmaceuticals-14-00111" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Recently Poma et al. [
 <xref rid="B6-pharmaceuticals-14-00111" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] showed that the essential oils of two succulent plants, rich in phytol, interfere with NF-κB on human cancer cell lines. Aliphatic compounds were the second most abundant class (22.89%), and heptacosane with 15.73% was the most abundant aliphatic compound and the most abundant one of the whole EO. Heptacosane falls into the category of phytoecdysteroids that mimic the biological function of the insect mover hormone, interfering with the synthesis of chitin, thus not allowing induction to the moult and metamorphosis [
 <xref rid="B43-pharmaceuticals-14-00111" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. This also may play a role in plant defense against insects. Benzyl benzoate is the only aromatic compound found in the EO of 
 <italic>E. insity</italic>. It is a powerful acaricide [
 <xref rid="B44-pharmaceuticals-14-00111" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The ketone compounds found in 
 <italic>E. intisy</italic> are the isomer (Z)-jasmone (0.23%) that is produced by some plants and can act both as an attractor and as a repellent for various insects [
 <xref rid="B45-pharmaceuticals-14-00111" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], and hexahydrofarnesyl-acetone (0.35%) that appears to be an antimicrobial for bacteria and fungi [

 <xref rid="B47-pharmaceuticals-14-00111" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Some of the compounds identified in 
 <italic>E. intisy</italic> are found in the EOs of other 
 <italic>Euphorbia</italic> species (as reported in the introduction): nonanal, phytol, heneicosane, heptacosane, and beta-elemol [
