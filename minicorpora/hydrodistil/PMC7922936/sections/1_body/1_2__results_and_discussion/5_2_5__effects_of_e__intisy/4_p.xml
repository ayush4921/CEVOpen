<p>Eid et al. [
 <xref rid="B51-pharmaceuticals-14-00111" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] indicates that, among others, lipophilic terpenoids are probably competitive inhibitors of P-gp in cancer cells. Devanjee at al. [
 <xref rid="B3-pharmaceuticals-14-00111" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] report that terpenoids possess significant P-gp inhibitory activity via different mechanisms. According to Wortelboer et al. [
 <xref rid="B52-pharmaceuticals-14-00111" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] citral inhibits MRP1 and MRP2. In particular, Duarte et al. [
 <xref rid="B22-pharmaceuticals-14-00111" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] identified latilagascene B, latilagascene E, and latilagascene D as inhibitors of P-gp that directly blocking its active sites. Some terpenoids can inhibit P-gp activity via binding with its active sites [
