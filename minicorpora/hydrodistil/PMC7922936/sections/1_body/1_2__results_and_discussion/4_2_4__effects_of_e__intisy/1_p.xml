<p>Due to the strong reduction of mRNA and protein level of P-gp under treatment with essential oil in our cell lines, we investigated the possible involvement of the EO in the drug resistance mechanism. P-gp-overexpressing cells show significant decreases in drug accumulation compared to non-P-gp-expressing. In order to evaluate the effects of 
 <italic>E. intisy</italic> EO on intracellular accumulation of doxorubicin, a P-gp substrate anticancer drug, HL-60 and HL-60R cells were treated with EO 15 μg/mL for 24 h. After this incubation, doxorubicin 1 μg/mL was added for different times (30 min, 1 h and 2 h). The intracellular accumulation of doxorubicin was measured by flow cytometric analysis. The results are presented as percentage of fluorescence intensity in HL-60 (
