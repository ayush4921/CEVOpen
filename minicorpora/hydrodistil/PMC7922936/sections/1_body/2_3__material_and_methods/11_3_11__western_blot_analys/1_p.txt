0: The whole-cell lysates were obtained from HL-60R cells using radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Dallas, TX, USA) and 25 g protein was subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham, Pharmacia Biotech, Milan, Italy) using a semi-dry fast blot apparatus (Bio-Rad, Milan, Italy).
1: Membranes were blocked with 5% ( w/v) BSA in PBS-0.1% ( v/v) Tween 20 for 1 h and then filters were incubated with primary antibodies raised against GAPDH (1:20,000; Sigma-Aldrich Srl, Milan, Italy.
2: ), XIAP (1:500; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. Danvers, MA, USA), survivin (1:2000, Abcam Limited, Cambridge, UK), Bcl-2 ( 1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and P-gp (1:100, Invitrogen, Milan, Italy).
3: The hybridization was visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate, Thermo Scientific Life Technologies Italia, Monza, Italy) and the Versa DOC imaging system (BioRad Laboratories, Milan, Italy).
4: Immunoblots were quantified by densitometry and results were expressed as arbitrary units (protein/GADPH).
