0: The identification of compounds was carried out using the mass spectral libraries in respect to our libraries were considered [ 38, 39], and NIST11.
1: We only considered compounds which showed mass spectral similarities > 80% in respect to our libraries.
2: Kovats retention indices were calculated using a series of n-alkanes (C10-C30).
