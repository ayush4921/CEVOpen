0: Total RNA was extracted from cell lines using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA).
1: For the evaluation of gene expression, RNA was reverse transcribed using a high-capacity complementary DNA (cDNA) reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems Life Technologies Inc., Foster City, CA, USA).
2: The resulting cDNAs were subjected to real-time RT-PCR using the TaqMan Gene Expression Master Mix kit (Applied Biosystems Life Technologies Inc., Foster City, CA, USA) in triplicates.
3: The PCR cycling conditions were as follows: Denaturation at 50 C for 2 min, annealing at 95 C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 C for 15 sec and extension at 60 C for 60 min.
4: The running of the samples and data collection were performed on a StepOne AB Real Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems Life Technologies Inc., Foster City, CA, USA).
5: -actin was used as an internal standard.
6: The specific TaqMan Assay used were: Survivin Hs00153353, XIAP Hs00236913, Bcl-2 Hs00236329, ABCB1 Hs00184005 (Applied Biosystems Life Technologies Inc., Foster City, CA, USA).
7: Relative expression was calculated using the comparative Ct method [Ct = Ct(target gene)Ct(housekeeping gene)].
8: Where Ct was the fractional cycle number at which the fluorescence of each sample passed the fixed threshold.
9: Fluorescence was measured at 515518 nm using StepOne AB Real Time PCR System software (Applied Biosystems Life Technologies Inc., Foster City, CA, USA).
10: The Ct method was used to determine gene expression levels.
11: Ct was calculated using the formula: Ct = Ct (each sample)Ct (reference sample).
12: Fold change was calculated using the 2  Ct equation.
