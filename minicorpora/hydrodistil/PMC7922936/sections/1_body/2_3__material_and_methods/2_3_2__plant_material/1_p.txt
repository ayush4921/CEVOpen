0: Unlignified stems of  Euphorbia intisy were collected in September 2018 from plants cultivated in the open air at the Botanical Garden of the University of Palermo.
1: The plants were raised from seeds in 1984 with reference code: Euphorbiaceae N.19.C.
2: The matrices were placed in paper bags and kept at 30 C for 24 h before hydrodistillation.
3: No specific permits were required for the collection of plant material because the plants are part of the living collection of the Botanical Garden of the University of Palermo and the authors have access to that.
4: The plant species used in the present study is listed in CITES Appendix II together with all succulent Euphorbiae and therefore seeds are exempt from the provisions of CITES.
5: The seeds were obtained, and the plants raised before the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) entered into force on 29 December 1993 and therefore are pre-CBD specimens.
