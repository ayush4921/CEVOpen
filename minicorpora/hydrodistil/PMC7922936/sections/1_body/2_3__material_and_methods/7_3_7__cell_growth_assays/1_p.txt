0: The cells were seeded at 5  10 3 cells/well onto 96-well plates and incubated overnight at 37 C. At time 0, the medium was replaced with fresh complete medium supplemented with the substances ( E. intisy EO, doxorubicin, or their combinations) at the indicated concentrations.
1: Following 72 h of treatment, 15 L commercial solution obtained from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI, USA) containing 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulphophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) and phenazine ethosulfate was added.
2: The plates were incubated in a humidified atmosphere at 37  C in 5% CO 2 for 2 h, and the bioreduction of MTS dye was evaluated by measuring the absorbance of each well at 490 nm using a microplate absorbance reader (iMark Microplate Reader; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA).
3: Cell growth inhibition was expressed as a percentage of the absorbance of the control cells.
4: For the combinations, to evaluate the type of interaction between the agents, dose-effect curves were analyzed according to the Chou and Talalay method [ 59] using CalcuSyn software (version 2.1; Biosoft, Cambridge, UK) as a non-constant ratio combination.
5: The combination index (CI) indicates a quantitative measure of the degree of drug interaction in terms of synergistic (CI< 1), additive (CI = 1) or antagonistic (CI > 1) effects.
