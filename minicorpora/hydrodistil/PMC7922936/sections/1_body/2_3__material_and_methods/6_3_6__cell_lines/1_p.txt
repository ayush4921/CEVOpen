0: The HL-60 cells were obtained from ATCC (CCL-240, Rockville, MD, USA), while its variant HL-60R were cultured as previously described [ 6].
1: Caco-2 cells was kindly provided by Professor Mario Allegra (Department of Biological, Chemical and Pharmaceutical Science and Technology, University of Palermo, Italy).
2: HL-60 and HL-60R cells were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640, while Caco-2 cells were cultured in Dulbeccos Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (HyClone Europe Ltd., Cramlington, UK) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 units /mL penicillin and 100 g/mL streptomycin (all reagents were from HyClone Europe Ltd., Cramlington, UK) in a humidified atmosphere at 37 C in 5% CO 2.
3: Caco-2 cells were treated 15 days after confluence, at which time the cells are differentiated in normal intestinal-like cells.
