0: Essential oil of  E. intisy was analyzed by GC-MS on a single quadrupole Shimadzu GC-MS-QP2010 (Kyoto, Japan) Plus equipped with an AOC-20i autoinjector (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) and a Supelcowax 10 capillary column (30 m long, 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 m film thickness).
1: One L of diluted samples (1/100  v/v, in n-pentane) was injected at 250 C in a split ratio of 1:1, and the column flow (carrier gas: helium) was set at 1 mL/min.
2: The GC oven temperature was held for 5 min at 40 C, then increased by 2 C/min to 180 C, held for 60 min, and finally raised to 240 C at 10 C/min.
3: The MS interface worked at 280 C, and the ion source at 250 C. Mass spectra were taken at 70 eV (in EI mode) from  m/z 30 to 600.
4: The GC/MS data were analyzed using the GCMSolution package, Version 4.11.
