0: In order to evaluate the effects of  E. intisy EO on intracellular accumulation of doxorubicin in HL-60R cell line, the cells were cultured in 24-well plates at a density of 1  10 5 cells per well.
1: After 24 h, the cells were treated with  E. intisy EO 15 g/mL or verapamil 10 M. After 24 h of incubation doxorubicin 1 g/mL has been added for different time: 30min, 1h and 2h.
2: Subsequently, the cells were washed twice with PBS and then resuspended in 400 L PBS for doxorubicin fluorescence intensity measurement by flow cytometry using a FACSAria III instrument (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA, USA).
3: The results are presented as percentage of fluorescence intensity relative to control (means  SE of three experiments).
