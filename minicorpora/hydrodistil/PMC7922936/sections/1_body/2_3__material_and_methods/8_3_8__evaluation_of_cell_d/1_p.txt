0: The cells were collected and washed twice with ice-cold PBS and then resuspended in a hypotonic fluorochrome solution containing propidium iodide (PI) 50 g/mL in 0.1% sodium citrate plus 0.03% ( v/v) Nonidet P-40, at 1  10 6/mL.
1: After incubation (at least 1 h at 4 C) in this solution, the samples were filtered through nylon cloth, 40 m mesh, and their fluorescence was analyzed using a FACSCanto instrument (Becton Dickinson, Montain View, CA, USA).
2: The data were analyzed with BD FACSDiva software v.6.1.2.
3: (Becton Dickinson).
4: Cell death was determined by evaluating the percentage of events accumulated in the preG 0-G 1 position [ 48].
