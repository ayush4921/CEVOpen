0: P-gp ATPase activity was performed with Pgp-GloTM Assay Systems (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) following manufacturers instructions.
1: Different concentrations of  E. intisy EO (test compound, TC) were added to a 96-well white plate in duplicate and incubated with recombinant human P-gp membranes.
2: No treatment control (NT) with only Pgp-GLO assay buffer was used to provide a measure of unregulated ATPase activity, while Na 3VO 4 (0.25 mM) was used as the selective inhibitor of P-gp ATPase activity and provides a measure of P-gp-independent ATPase activity.
3: Verapamil (0.5 mM) is a P-gp substrate that stimulates P-gp ATPase activity and serves as a positive control for drug stimulation of P-gp ATPase activity.
4: We also performed an ATP Standards curve as internal control, to verify the correct execution of the assay, and another control with DMSO (equivalent amount of higher concentration of  E. intisy EO).
5: MgATP (5 mM) was added to initiate the ATPase activity.
6: After 40 min incubation at 37 C, the reaction was stopped with 50 L ATPase Detection Reagent and then incubated for 20 min at room temperature.
7: Luminescence was measured using a GLOMAX Multidetection System (Promega).
8: We calculated RLU basal that reflects basal P-gp ATPase activity as the difference between the average luminescent signals from Na 3VO 4-treated samples (RLU Na3VO4) and untreated (NT) samples (RLU NT).
9: After, we calculated RLU TC that reflects P-gp ATPase activity in the presence of a test compound, as the difference between the average luminescent signals from Na 3VO 4-treated samples (RLU Na3VO4) and test compound-treated samples (RLU TC).
10: The data were presented as change in luminescence (RLU).
11: To confirm that the EO acts like the verapamil, we examined its inhibitory effects against a verapamil-stimulated P-gp ATPase activity; in this case verapamil is added in the TC wells, and the results presented as RLU produced by EO on stimulated P-gp.
