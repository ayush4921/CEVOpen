0: The DNA binding capacity of NF-B (p65 subunit) was measured in the nuclear extracts of cells treated using the TransAM NF-B and Nuclear ExtractTM Kits (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturers instructions.
1: The results were expressed as arbitrary units: One unit is the DNA binding capacity shown by 2.5 g of whole cell extract from Jurkat cells stimulated with 12-Otetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) + calcium ionophore (CI)/g protein of HL-60/R nuclear extracts.
