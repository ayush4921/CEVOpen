<p>Additionally, 
 <xref rid="plants-09-01532-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> contains values of biochemical parameters of oxidative stress measured in the control group that was treated with distillated water and in groups that were treated only with SC1 and SD1 extracts [
 <xref rid="B36-plants-09-01532" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. By comparing these values with the parameters of oxidative stress determined in this study, it can be concluded that extracts exhibit selectivity towards tumor cells by inducing them into oxidative stress, while not manifesting any side-effects on the healthy cells.
