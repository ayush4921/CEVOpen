 <sub>2</sub> (350 bar and 50 °C) was applied to obtain extracts that are lipophilic in character and contained the highest content of carvacrol [

 <xref rid="B33-plants-09-01532" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The goal was to evaluate the antitumor activity of extracts of winter savory of polar and non-polar character to identify the potential mechanism of activity of extracts. Furthermore, to determine whether carvacrol as the most dominant component in winter savory is responsible for the manifestation of the activity, essential oil was isolated from powder and its chemical profile was determined [
