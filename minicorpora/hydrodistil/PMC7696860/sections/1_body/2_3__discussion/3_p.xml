<p>Considering that the Sc-CO
 <sub>2</sub> is a solvent that extracts only non-polar components while the mixture water/ethanol shows an affinity toward more polar components, the content of carvacrol in supercritical extract was expectedly multiple times higher compared to the powder (SC 60.82 g/100 g; SD 902.52 mg/100 g), according to the GC-FID (gas chromatography with flame-ionization detection) analysis [

Polyphenolic components that were identified in the extracts of winter savory are caffeic, syringic, rosmarinic, gallic, ferulic, cinnamic, syringic, gentisic, ferulic, and vanillic acids, as well as luteolin, rutin, epicatechin, catechin, and quercetin [
