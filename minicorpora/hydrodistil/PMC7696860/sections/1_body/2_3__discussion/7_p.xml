<p>Ascites fluid is highly important for the development of tumor considering that it represents a source of food for its cells; therefore, the increase in volume of ascites is a significant indicator of proliferation of tumor cells [
 <xref rid="B41-plants-09-01532" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. It was determined that the application of extracts leads to a decrease in volume of ascites in groups of mice, but not in the number of cells. Therefore, it can be assumed that in the decreased volume of ascites there is a concentrated higher number of cells and that extracts do not exhibit an impact in that respect; that is, they do not lead to the death of cells nor the inhibition of cell growth. Hence, they do not exhibit cytotoxic nor cytostatic activity with regard to malignant cells. The potential oncostatic effect (statistically insignificant) was exhibited only by SC (SC1 and SC5) and SD5 extracts applied as treatment.
