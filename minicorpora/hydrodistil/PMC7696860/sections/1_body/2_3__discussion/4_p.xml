<p>The antioxidative activity of extracts was investigated by using the DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl-hydrate) assay. By comparing the manifested activities, expressed as the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value; that is, the concentration with which 50% of free radicals is inhibited, the dry extract showed a stronger antioxidative activity (SC 17.40 µg/mL; SD 5.24 µg/mL) [

 <xref rid="B36-plants-09-01532" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The extract with the more dominant percentage of carvacrol did not exhibit a stronger antioxidative activity. An explanation for this can be that carvacrol is not the main carrier of antioxidative activities in the extract. Additionally, Serrano et al. [
 <xref rid="B37-plants-09-01532" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] reported a stronger antioxidant activity of ethanolic and aqueous extracts compared to essential oil. A reason they state the presence of a higher content of phenolic acids, such as rosmarinic and others, is that, because of their hydroxyl group, they have a strong capability of capturing free radicals. Further, it is suggested that the presence of sesquiterpenes, which generally have a lower antioxidative capacity, contributes to the lower antioxidative activity of oils [
