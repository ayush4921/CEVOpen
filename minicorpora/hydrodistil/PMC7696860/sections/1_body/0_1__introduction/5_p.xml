<p>For the aforementioned reasons, this study investigated the antiproliferative activities of 
 <italic>S. montana</italic> extracts obtained by applying environmentally-friendly techniques and using the model of induced Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) in mice. Considering that winter savory possesses significant bioactive components that are polar and non-polar in character, lipophilic extracts obtained by supercritical carbon-dioxide extraction (Sc-CO
 <sub>2</sub>) and extracts with a more polar character obtained by solidâ€“liquid extraction with ethanol followed by the spray drying process were investigated. To determine the potential of extracts, parameters of tumor growth and the antioxidant status of malignant cells were monitored. In addition, the impact of extracts before, at the time of, and after the implantation of EAC cells was monitored.
