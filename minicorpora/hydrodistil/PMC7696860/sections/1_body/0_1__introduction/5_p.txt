0: For the aforementioned reasons, this study investigated the antiproliferative activities of  S. montana extracts obtained by applying environmentally-friendly techniques and using the model of induced Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) in mice.
1: Considering that winter savory possesses significant bioactive components that are polar and non-polar in character, lipophilic extracts obtained by supercritical carbon-dioxide extraction (Sc-CO 2) and extracts with a more polar character obtained by solidliquid extraction with ethanol followed by the spray drying process were investigated.
2: To determine the potential of extracts, parameters of tumor growth and the antioxidant status of malignant cells were monitored.
3: In addition, the impact of extracts before, at the time of, and after the implantation of EAC cells was monitored.
