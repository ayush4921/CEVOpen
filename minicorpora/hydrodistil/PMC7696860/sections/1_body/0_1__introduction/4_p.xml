<p>Furthermore, the demand for natural products which is, along with market competition, constantly on the rise, dictates the demand for introducing new, modern, efficient, and green procedures which are to provide a stable, quality, and safe product. Modern production processes have to meet the following requirements of the modern market: production without the use of toxic solvents, extended stability of products, optimized chemical composition with efficient use of natural resources, reduced use of energy, higher process safety, and reduction of waste. The attainment of winter savory extracts was investigated by applying different modern green techniques and alternative solvents including supercritical and subcritical fluids [
