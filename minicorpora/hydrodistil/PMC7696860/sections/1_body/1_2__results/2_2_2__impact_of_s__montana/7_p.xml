<p>Compared to the EAC control group, the amount of GSH was reduced in all groups that were pretreated. Moreover, a significant reduction in GSH was recorded in groups in which SC extracts were applied. Furthermore, animal treatment with extracts also resulted in a decrease in the amount of GSH, and SC extracts in the treatment also led to a significant reduction in the amount of GSH compared to SD extracts. In post-treatments, a reduction was recorded only in the case of SD1, while with SC extracts and SD5, an increase in the amount of GSG was determined.</p>
