<p>The activity of the GR enzyme in tumor cells was significantly different after the application of extracts. SC extracts and SD5 in the pretreated groups caused an increase in the activity of GR. Moreover, the highest increase was recorded in the group of mice pretreated with SC5. By starting therapy at the moment of tumor implantation, there were significant changes in the activity of enzymes in EAC cells. The treatment with SC and SD5 resulted in an increase, while treating mice with SD1 resulted in a decrease in the activity in the GR in EAC cells. After the application of SD1 in post-treated groups of animals, an increase was recorded, while the post-treatment with other extracts resulted in a decrease in the activity of GR.</p>
