<p>In the control group, the XOD activity in EAC cells was low, and by applying the SC extracts in pretreatments, there was a significant increase in the XOD activity in malignant cells, without a difference in their impact on this parameter (SC1 and SC5). On the other hand, the application of SD extracts did not cause any significant changes in the intensity of XOD. In the groups treated with extracts, significant changes in the activity of enzymes were determined where SC extracts intensified the XOD activity in EAC cells, as well as in the treatment with SD5. Furthermore, the treatment with a lower concentration of SD significantly decreased the activity of XOD. The application of extracts in post-treatments caused significant changes in all groups (except in the posttreatment with SD1)â€”a decrease in XOD activity compared to the EAC group, while the post-treatment with SD1 caused an increase in the XOD activity.</p>
