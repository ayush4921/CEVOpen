<p>The GSPHx activity in EAC cells when extracts SD5 and SC were applied prior to the implantation of tumor, increased compared to the control group. The impact of extracts that were applied as a treatment was also significant. It was determined that there was an increase in this activity in all treated groups (SC1, SC5, and SD5), except for the group treated with SD1 where the GSHPx activity was significantly decreased. The post-treatment of animals with SC1, SC5, and SD5 extracts caused a decrease in the GSPHx activity, and an increase with the application of SD1.</p>
