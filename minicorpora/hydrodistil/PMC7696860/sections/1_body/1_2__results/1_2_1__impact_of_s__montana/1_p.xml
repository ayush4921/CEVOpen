<p>In order to determine the activity of 
 <italic>S. montana</italic> extracts on the parameters of tumor growth, the changes in cell parameters were monitoredâ€”ascites volume, number of tumor cells, and tumor cells variability (

 <sub>2</sub> (SC extract) was investigated in two concentrations (1% (SD1 and SC1) and 5% (SD5 and SC5)) and different impacts of the extracts on the volume of ascites were recorded (

 <xref rid="plants-09-01532-t0A1" ref-type="table">Table A1</xref>). After the application of extracts in the pretreatment (both extracts and both concentrations), there was a significant decrease in the volume of ascites compared to the EAC control group. Moreover, the most significant decrease was recorded in the group that was pretreated with SC5. During treatment, there was also a significant decrease in the volume of the ascites when all extracts were applied. In addition, the most efficient decrease among the treated groups was recorded in a group in which SD5 was applied. In the posttreatment, a reduced volume was only recorded in a group in which SD1 was applied, while in all other groups an increase in the volume of ascites compared to the EAC group was recorded.
