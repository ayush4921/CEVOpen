0: The samples were diluted with KrebsRinger phosphate buffer and the activities of antioxidant enzymes were determined in EAC cells by standard laboratory protocols.

2: [ 47], glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx) according to Beutler et al.
3: [ 48], and glutathione reductase (GR) according to Goldberg and Spooner [ 49].
4: The amount of reduced glutathione (GSH) was determined according to Beutler [ 50], as well as the intensity of lipid peroxidation (LPx) using the Buege and Aust protocol [ 51].
