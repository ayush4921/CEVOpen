<p>During experimental work, mice were divided into groups of 6 mice through random selection and were treated in accordance with the following protocol: 
 <list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
   <p>Group EAC—animals with implanted Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) cells treated with 2 mL/kg of saline, i.p. (n = 6).</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Group PRETREATMENT—animals pretreated with 2 mL/kg of the investigated extract, i.p. during seven days (n = 6).</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Group TREATMENT—animals were treated with 2 mL/kg of the investigated extract, i.p. seven days after the implantation of EAC (n = 6).</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Group POSTTREATMENT—animals post-treated with 2 mL/kg of the investigated extract, i.p. during seven days, seven days after implantation (n = 6).</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>After 14 days from the day of implementation of EAC, all animals were sacrificed and the ascites was collected for further biochemical analyses.</p>
