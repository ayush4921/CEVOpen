0: The ascites from the abdomen was transferred to KrebsRinger phosphate buffer solution (0 C, pH 7.4) and subjected to sequential centrifuging at 4500 rpm (MSE HIGH SPEED, 4 C) and 12,000 rpm (Eppendorf 3200, 2.5 min) to obtain a dense cell suspension (1:1).
1: The cell number was counted in a Neubauer chamber and expressed as number of cells/mm 3.
2: Cell viability was determined by the Trypan blue exclusion method and expressed as percentage of damaged cells.
