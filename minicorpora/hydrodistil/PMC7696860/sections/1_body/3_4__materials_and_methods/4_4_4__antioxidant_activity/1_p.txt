0: The antioxidant activity of extracts was analyzed using the DPPH assay [ 44].
1: Different volumes of extracts were mixed with 95% and 90 M DPPH solution.
2: After the 60-min incubation at room temperature, absorption was measured at a wavelength of 515 nm.
3: The antioxidant activity was expressed as IC 50 value which represents the concentration of the extract which inhibits 50% DPPH radicals.
4: All the measurements were performed in triplicate.
