<p>The antioxidant activity of extracts was analyzed using the DPPH assay [
 <xref rid="B44-plants-09-01532" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Different volumes of extracts were mixed with 95% and 90 Î¼M DPPH solution. After the 60-min incubation at room temperature, absorption was measured at a wavelength of 515 nm. The antioxidant activity was expressed as IC
 <sub>50</sub> value which represents the concentration of the extract which inhibits 50% DPPH radicals. All the measurements were performed in triplicate.
