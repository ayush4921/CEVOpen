0: Gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GC/MS) and gas chromatography with flame-ionization detection (GC/FID) analyses were performed according to the procedures described in previous studies [ 32, 33].
1: GC analysis was performed on an Agilent GC6890N system coupled with a mass spectrometer model Agilent MS 5795.
2: An HP-5MS column (30 m length, 0.25 mm inner diameter, and 0.25 m film thickness) was used.
3: Essential oil was isolated from SD powder using the hydrodistillation procedure according to the European Pharmacopoeia (Clevenger-type apparatus) and its chemical profile was determined.
4: The injected volume of the sample solution (SD in methylene chloride and SC in methanol) was 5 L with a split ratio of 30:1.
5: Aromatic compounds were identified using the NIST 05 and the Wiley 7n mass database.
6: The GC/MS operating conditions were as follows: injector temperature 250 C, temperature program 60150 C (4 C/min), carrier gas He with flow rate 2 mL/min.
7: Quantification of carvacrol was performed with an FID detector and the calibration curve for carvacrol.
8: The GC/FID operating conditions were: injector temperature 250 C, temperature program 60150 C (4 C/min), and detector temperature 300 C.
