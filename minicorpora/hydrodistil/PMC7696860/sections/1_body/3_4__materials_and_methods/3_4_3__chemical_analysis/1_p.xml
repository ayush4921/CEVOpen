<p>Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and gas chromatography with flame-ionization detection (GC/FID) analyses were performed according to the procedures described in previous studies [

 <xref rid="B33-plants-09-01532" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. GC analysis was performed on an Agilent GC6890N system coupled with a mass spectrometer model Agilent MS 5795. An HP-5MS column (30 m length, 0.25 mm inner diameter, and 0.25 μm film thickness) was used. Essential oil was isolated from SD powder using the hydrodistillation procedure according to the European Pharmacopoeia (Clevenger-type apparatus) and its chemical profile was determined. The injected volume of the sample solution (SD in methylene chloride and SC in methanol) was 5 μL with a split ratio of 30:1. Aromatic compounds were identified using the NIST 05 and the Wiley 7n mass database. The GC/MS operating conditions were as follows: injector temperature 250 °C, temperature program 60–150 °C (4 °C/min), carrier gas He with flow rate 2 mL/min. Quantification of carvacrol was performed with an FID detector and the calibration curve for carvacrol. The GC/FID operating conditions were: injector temperature 250 °C, temperature program 60–150 °C (4 °C/min), and detector temperature 300 °C.
