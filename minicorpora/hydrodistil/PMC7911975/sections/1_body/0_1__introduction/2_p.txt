0: Accordingly, the present study was designed to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of PCEO (new chemotype) from dry berries against thirteen pathogenic strains and to demonstrate for the first time their wound healing effects using an in vivo rat wound model based on a series of clinical, biochemical and histopathological assays.
1: Furthermore, molecular docking studies were performed to investigate the potential binding mode of the selected PCEO phytocompounds against  S. aureus TyrRS known as an attractive target enzyme for finding new antibacterial agents.
