<p>The MICs, MBCs and MFCs results of PCEO against microbial strains ranged from 1.56 to 12.5 mg/mL (MICs) and 3.12 to 25 mg/mL (MBCs) for bacterial strains, and from 3.12 to 6.25 mg/mL (MICs) and 12.5 to 25 mg/mL (MFCs) for fungal strains. We note the highest susceptibility of 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> and 
 <italic>F.</italic> sp. to PCEO with MIC of 3.12 mg/mL and MFC of 12.5 mg/mL, respectively.
