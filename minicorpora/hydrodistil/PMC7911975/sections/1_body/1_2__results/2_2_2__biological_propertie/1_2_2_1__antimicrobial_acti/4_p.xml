<p>In addition, we determined the ratio MBC/MIC for bacteria MFC/MIC for fungi. When these ratios were less than or equal 2.0, the PCEO was considered as bactericidal or fungicidal, or otherwise bacteriostatic or fungistatic, respectively. If the ratio is greater than or equal 16.0, the extract was considered ineffective. Based on the results depicted in 
 <xref rid="plants-10-00205-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, it can be concluded that our oil exerted a bactericidal effect against 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>, 
 <italic>S. enterica</italic>, 
 <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. On the contrary, amongst the tested fungi, 
 <italic>P. catenulatum</italic>, 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> and 
 <italic>F.</italic> sp. showed a fungistatic effect however, 
 <italic>F. phyllophilum</italic> remains ineffective.
