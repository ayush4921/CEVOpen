0: Oxidative status in skin tissue could be estimated from the concentration of lipid peroxidation and the activity of antioxidant enzymes, malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD).
1: To measure these indicators organs tissues were grind into small pieces and inversed into 2 mL ice cold buffer (TBS, pH 7.4); the mixtures were homogenized on ice using an Ultra-Turraks homogenizer for 15 min and then filtered and centrifuged.
