0: The rats were depilated on the back and a predetermined area of 500 mm 2 full thickness skin was excised in the dorsal.
1: Rats wounds were left undressed to the open environment.
2: This model was used to monitor wound contraction and epithelialization time.
3: The reference standard drug Cicaflora  and cream including PCEO (prepared by mixing with petroleum jelly in a concentration of 5%  w/w) were applied every day until the wound was completely healed.
4: The progressive changes in wound area were monitored planimetrically by tracing the wound margin on a graph paper every alternate day.
5: The changes in healing of the wound or the measurement of the wound area traced on graph paper were expressed as unit (mm 2).
6: Wound contraction was expressed as a percentage reduction of original wound size.
