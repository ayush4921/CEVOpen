<p>The rats were depilated on the back and a predetermined area of 500 mm
 <sup>2</sup> full thickness skin was excised in the dorsal. Rat’s wounds were left undressed to the open environment. This model was used to monitor wound contraction and epithelialization time. The reference standard drug “Cicaflora
 <sup>®</sup>” and cream including PCEO (prepared by mixing with petroleum jelly in a concentration of 5% 
 <italic>w/w</italic>) were applied every day until the wound was completely healed. The progressive changes in wound area were monitored planimetrically by tracing the wound margin on a graph paper every alternate day. The changes in healing of the wound or the measurement of the wound area traced on graph paper were expressed as unit (mm
 <sup>2</sup>). Wound contraction was expressed as a percentage reduction of original wound size.
