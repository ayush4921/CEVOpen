<p>The structures of the natural compounds were minimized using a conjugate gradient AMMP incorporated in VEGA ZZ. [
 <xref rid="B66-plants-10-00205" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] The conversion of the file from PDB to PDBQT was done using ADT. We applied AutoDock Vina software [
 <xref rid="B67-plants-10-00205" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] with an exhaustiveness parameter of 32 to perform the docking simulations. ADT was used for the docking conformation analysis. Receptor ligand interactions are visualized by Discovery Studio Visualizer [
