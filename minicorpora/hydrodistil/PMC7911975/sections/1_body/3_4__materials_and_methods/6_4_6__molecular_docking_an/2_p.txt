0: The structures of the natural compounds were minimized using a conjugate gradient AMMP incorporated in VEGA ZZ.
1: [ 66] The conversion of the file from PDB to PDBQT was done using ADT.
2: We applied AutoDock Vina software [ 67] with an exhaustiveness parameter of 32 to perform the docking simulations.
3: ADT was used for the docking conformation analysis.
4: Receptor ligand interactions are visualized by Discovery Studio Visualizer [ 68].
