0: Interactions between natural compound and  S. aureus tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase were assessed by in silico molecular docking in order to explore the preferred orientation of the ligands in the binding site of receptor.
1: The crystal structures were obtained from the Protein Data Bank:  S. aureus tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (PDB code 1JIJ).
2: All water molecules have been removed and the co-crystallized ligand from the structures.
3: Polar hydrogens and Gasteiger charges were assigned with AutoDockTools1.5.2 (ADT) and the PDBQT file format was prepared [ 65].
4: ADT was used to select a docking grid.
5: In 1JIJ, the grid box site was established in 10.908, 14.432 and 86.420 A (x, y and z).
6: The grid box size for the coordinates x, y and z was 25 A, with a grid spacing of 0.375 A.
