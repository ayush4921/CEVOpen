0: The MIC is the lowest concentration in extract inhibiting any visible growth of microorganisms.
1: It was determined by the microdilution method used by Felhi et al.
2: [ 63].
3: Serial and semiserial dilutions were prepared to obtain a concentration range.
4: Thus, 90 L of MH broth for the bacteria were dispersed in each well by adding 10 L of each inoculum already prepared.
5: Of each dilution of the PCEO 100 L was thus poured.
6: The last well, containing the MH for bacteria without addition of the oil, was considered as a positive growth control.
7: In addition, another well, containing DMSO without PCEO, was used as a negative control.
8: The final volume in each well was equal to 200 L.
