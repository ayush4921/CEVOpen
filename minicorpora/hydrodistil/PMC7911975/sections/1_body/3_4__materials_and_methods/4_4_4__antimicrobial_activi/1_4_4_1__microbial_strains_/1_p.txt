0: Antimicrobial assay was performed in in vitro cultures across 13 microbial strains, including 5 Gram-positive bacteria ( Bacillus cereus (JN 934390) as the most important cause of food poisoning,  Bacillus subtilis (JN 934392), which are endospore-forming, rod-shaped, facultative anaerobic bacteria that are widely distributed in nature,  Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6538) as a sphere-shaped bacteria responsible of skin infections and can cause also pneumonia and heart valve infections,  Listeria monocytogenes (ATCC 19115) as a food-borne pathogen responsible for listeriosis, a sickness with a high mortality rate,  Micrococcus luteus (NCIMB 8166) is a non-motile, non-sporing cocci belonging to the Micrococcea family considered as a non-pathogenic saprophyte of human skin and eye), 4 Gram-negative bacteria ( Klebsiella pneumonia (ATCC 10031) often causes bacterial pneumonia, or infection of the lungs,  Salmonella enteric (ATCC 43972) and  Salmonella typhimurium (ATCC 19430) are the dominant cause of non-typhoidal  Salmonella infections and  Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) as a pathogenic bacteria predominately found in the intestinal lumen) and 4 fungi ( Pythium catenulatum (AY598675) known to be plant pathogens of both crops and vegetables,  Fusarium oxysporum (AB586994),  Fusarium phyllophilum (AB587006) and  Fusarium sp.
1: (JX391934) frequently are responsible of skin infections and can produce mycotoxins, which cause various disorders, including cancer in animals and humans).
2: The evaluation of the antimicrobial capacity was carried out based on the same protocol as displayed by Ghannay et al.
3: [ 63, 64].
4: The bacteria were seeded on petri dishes containing Mueller Hinton agar (MH) and incubated for 24 h. From these plates, bacterial culture was prepared in 3 mL MH broth for 24 h at 200 rpm and 37 C. The optical density was read at 600 nm and adjusted at 0.080.10 density equivalent to 10 8 CFU/mL.
5: 20 mL of (MH) agar were cast in Petri dishes 90 mm in diameter.
6: After solidification, 100 L of the bacterial suspension (10 8 CFU/mL) were spread on the surface of the agar using a sterile swab.
7: After 5 min of contact, 6 mm diameter wells were dug with a sterile Pasteur pipette in MH and each well was filled with 75 L of sample.
8: Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) was served as a negative control.
9: The Petri dishes thus prepared were incubated at +4 C for 4 h to allow the diffusion of the active substance.
10: Finally, the dishes were incubated in an oven at 37 C or 30 C, for 24 or 48 h depending on the microorganism tested.
11: The tests were carried out in triplicate and the results are expressed in mm.
12: The bacterial strains showing sensitivity to the EO were selected to determine the minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations.
