<p>Our results showed also that the level of MDA, lipid peroxidation marker, increased after wound induction. In contrast, treatment with PCEO reduced this level. Lipid peroxidation is found to be an important pathophysiological event inducing also oxidative deterioration of poly unsaturated fatty acids, which leads to cellular injury and also promotes the generation of ROS in the tissue site, which damage cell structures [

On the other hand, the application of PCEO cream in rats to wound tissue increased the SOD level suggesting the protective effect of the PCEO against the oxidative damage induced by these wounds. Therefore, the enhanced wound healing by SOD repaired the tissue damage, which is a result of the increased antioxidant enzyme level in the granulation tissue due to the high free radical scavenging effect of PCEO [

This effect have been recently confirmed by our team revealing that PCEO exhibited a potent antioxidant activity using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity, ferric reducing/antioxidant power (FRAP) and Î²-carotene bleaching assays in comparison to the positive controls, butylated hydroxytoluene and ascorbic acid and the results have been well supported by molecular docking analysis [
