<p>In summary, PCEO from fruits showed potent antibacterial and antifungal activities against several pathogenic strains and antioxidant potential reinforcing the popular useful of this plant in traditional cure. The topical application of PCEO cream on rats exhibited significant wound healing potency by stimulating the wound contraction, increasing the antioxidant enzymes activities and regenerating skin tissues. In addition, computational study confirms the high potency of PCEO as an anti-infection agent. Therefore, the beneficial effects of PCEO cream on wound healing might be related to the dual antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of PCEO constituents able to prevent oxidative damage triggered by free radicals and to treat infections caused by pathogenic bacteria and fungi. Further studies with purified constituents are required to elucidate the optimal conditions, the principal bioactive compound and the mechanism of wound healing activity completed with clinical assays to assess the modalities of administration in practice.</p>
