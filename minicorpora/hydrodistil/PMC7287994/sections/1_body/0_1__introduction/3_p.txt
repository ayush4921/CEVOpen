0: Traditionally, agar dilution, broth dilution or broth microdilution methods have been used to measure the minimal inhibitory concentrations of antimicrobial agents against microorganisms [ 16, 17].
1: Unfortunately, these methods have been limited to measuring the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of antimicrobials only in the liquid phase.
2: In the last few years, several methods and the modification-testing MICs of antimicrobials in the vapor phase were developed.
3: Usually, the disc volatilization method with various modifications is used [ 10, 11, 12, 17, 18].
