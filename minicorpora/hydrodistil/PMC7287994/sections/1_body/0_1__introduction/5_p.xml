<p>Due to the growing demand for natural products and in light of the prevalence of pharmaceuticals, antioxidants or food additives in the food preservation process, it is necessary to find new sources for developing these products and to specify their properties. Plant-derived essential oils have received significant attention in this field. The aim of this study was to find herbs used both in the cuisine and natural medicine and determine their EOs composition and especially their antimicrobial efficiency in both vapor and liquid phase. In this study were two EOs obtained by hydrodistillation and thereafter analyzed by standard techniques GC–MS and GC–FID. Antimicrobial activity was determined by the modern, recently developed method of Houdkova et al. [
