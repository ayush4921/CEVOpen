0: In recent years, many researchers have been focused on finding new antimicrobial agents that could be applied to multi-resistant microorganisms.
1: Medicinal herbs and their products, such as essential oils (EOs), are the main source of natural remedies.
2: They have been used since the time immemorial as the most affordable means of treating diseases.
3: As it has been proven several times, EOs have diverse biological properties.
4: They are bactericidal, viricidal, fungicidal, antiparasitic, antioxidant and insecticidal [ 1, 2, 3].
5: EOs and their components have activity against a variety of targets, particularly the membrane and cytoplasm, and, in some cases, they can completely change the morphology of the cells [ 4].
6: They contain a wide range of complex and structurally different compounds that are biologically, respectively, antimicrobially active.
7: Antimicrobial activity is closely related to the chemical composition of EOs, functional groups and possible synergic interactions among constituents.
8: In addition, due to the combination of these active compounds, bacteria are more difficult to develop a resistance to these compounds in comparison with commercial antimicrobials, which are usually based on one chemical substance [ 5].
9: In order to use EOs for treating various diseases caused by bacteria, it is important to understand to the relationship between their chemical composition and the potential antimicrobial activity.
