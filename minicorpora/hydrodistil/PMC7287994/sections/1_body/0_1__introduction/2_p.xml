<p>EOs are volatile, and their vapors influence their antimicrobial properties. Therefore, it is necessary to sufficiently investigate the composition and properties of the vapors of essential oil. Currently, several researchers have investigated the vapor phase of the essential oil, but it deserves much wider research and consideration when examining the properties of essential oils [

It is assumed that active compounds in both phases are synergic and furthermore it has been shown that vapor phase is sometimes even more effective than liquid phase to some microorganisms. If biologically active molecules were present in the vapor phase, there would be, for example, the possibility of using EOs for the inhalation and treatment of respiratory diseases [
