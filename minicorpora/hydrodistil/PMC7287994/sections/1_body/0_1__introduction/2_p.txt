0: EOs are volatile, and their vapors influence their antimicrobial properties.
1: Therefore, it is necessary to sufficiently investigate the composition and properties of the vapors of essential oil.
2: Currently, several researchers have investigated the vapor phase of the essential oil, but it deserves much wider research and consideration when examining the properties of essential oils [ 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12].
3: It is assumed that active compounds in both phases are synergic and furthermore it has been shown that vapor phase is sometimes even more effective than liquid phase to some microorganisms.
4: If biologically active molecules were present in the vapor phase, there would be, for example, the possibility of using EOs for the inhalation and treatment of respiratory diseases [ 8, 9].
5: Furthermore, there would be the possibility of using these properties of EOs to produce various food packaging materials that protect food against the spread of microorganisms and extend their shelf life [ 13, 14, 15].
