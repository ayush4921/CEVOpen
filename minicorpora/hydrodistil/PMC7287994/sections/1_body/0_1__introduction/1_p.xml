<p>In recent years, many researchers have been focused on finding new antimicrobial agents that could be applied to multi-resistant microorganisms. Medicinal herbs and their products, such as essential oils (EOs), are the main source of natural remedies. They have been used since the time immemorial as the most affordable means of treating diseases. As it has been proven several times, EOs have diverse biological properties. They are bactericidal, viricidal, fungicidal, antiparasitic, antioxidant and insecticidal [

Antimicrobial activity is closely related to the chemical composition of EOs, functional groups and possible synergic interactions among constituents. In addition, due to the combination of these active compounds, bacteria are more difficult to develop a resistance to these compounds in comparison with commercial antimicrobials, which are usually based on one chemical substance [
