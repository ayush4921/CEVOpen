<p>Traditionally, agar dilution, broth dilution or broth microdilution methods have been used to measure the minimal inhibitory concentrations of antimicrobial agents against microorganisms [

Unfortunately, these methods have been limited to measuring the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of antimicrobials only in the liquid phase. In the last few years, several methods and the modification-testing MICs of antimicrobials in the vapor phase were developed. Usually, the disc volatilization method with various modifications is used [
