<p>When comparing both EOs, it was found that they have only 12 common compounds out of 41 but they vary in the percent content. The essential oil from 
 <italic>Hottuynia cordata</italic> contained much more monoterpenes and monoterpenoids, where the most abundant compound was myrcene (51%) that was not found in the essential oil from the 
 <italic>P. odorata</italic>. On the other hand, the essential oil from 
 <italic>Persicaria odorata</italic> contained more sesquiterpenes, sesquipterpenoids and especially aldehydes, where 
 <italic>n</italic>-dodecanal (37.1%) was the dominant compound compared to 
 <italic>H. cordata</italic> essential oil, where it was only 0.02%. In general, the composition of both essential oils is different. The results are adequate because both herbs are neither from the same genus nor family, so their similarity in composition was not expected. They were selected for this study according to their similar use and same geographical occurrence.
