<p>Hydrodistillation in Clevenger-type apparatus of 
 <italic>Persicaria odorata</italic> produced a deep yellow liquid with a strong spicy coriander-like aroma. Due to its aroma, it is also called Vietnamese coriander [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-25-02432" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The essential oil content of distilled aerial parts of dried plant was 0.41%. The extraction yield is lower in comparison with those previously published by A. A. Almarie et al. [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-25-02432" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] who achieved a yield of 0.64%. A total of 41 compounds were identified that made up 90.4% of the essential oil composition. In comparison with other reports, we identified more compounds [

 <xref rid="B39-molecules-25-02432" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. N. X. Dung et al. [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-25-02432" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] used steam distillation for the isolation of essential oils and they identified 28 compounds and the most abundant were β-caryophyllene, dodecanal and caryophyllene oxide. M. V. Hunter et al. [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-25-02432" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] only identified 17 compounds using steam distillation as an extraction technique for the isolation of essential oil from 
 <italic>P. odorata</italic>, where the most abundant compounds were α-humulene, decanal and dodecanal. Our essential oil contained a higher amount of non-terpenoid compounds (72.7%) followed by terpenoid compounds (17.7%). Carbonyls and alcohols, especially C10 and C12, made up 68.8% of essential oil composition, followed by the group of sesquiterpenes with a content of 11.5% and oxidized sesquiterpenes with a content of 5.7%. Other groups (monoterpenes, oxidized monoterpenes and oxidized diterpenes) made up less than 1% of essential oil constitution. The major compounds of the essential oil were 
 <italic>n</italic>-dodecanal (37.1%), 
 <italic>n</italic>-decanal (18.1%), 1-decanol (5.4%), 1-dodecanol (4.8%), α-humulene (4.5%), 
 <italic>cis</italic>-caryophyllene (3.9%) and 
 <italic>n</italic>-undecane (2.5%). The other compounds were present at less than 2%. These results in relative percent content are similar with the results of previous reports. It can clearly be seen that the essential oil from 
 <italic>Persicaria odorata</italic> is rich in C10 and C12 carbonyls. Dodecanal and decanal are the main compounds of 
 <italic>Persicaria odorata</italic> essential oil in all previous published reports and ours [
