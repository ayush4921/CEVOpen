<p>Hydrodistillation in the Clevenger-type apparatus of 
 <italic>Houttuynia cordata</italic> produced a pale-yellow liquid with a fishy scent. The essential oil content of distilled aerial parts of dried plant was 0.34%. The extraction yield is higher in comparison with those previously published by R. S. Verma et al. [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-25-02432" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] who only achieved a yield of 0.06–0.14%. A total of 41 compounds were identified that made up 90.6% of the essential oil composition (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-02432-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The essential oil contained a higher amount of terpenoid compounds (75.5%), followed by non-terpenoid compounds (15.1%), such as derivates of phenylpropene, aldehydes, ketones, esters and fatty acids. The major group of substances was monoterpenes with a content of 59.4%, followed by the group of other compounds with a content of 14.8%, oxidized monoterpenes with a content of 7.2% and sesquiterpenes with a content of 6.6%. Other groups were oxidized sesquiterpenes and derivates of phenylpropene. Major compounds of the essential oil were myrcene (51.6%), 2-undecanone (6.7%), tridecan-2-one (6.1%), 
 <italic>cis-</italic>β-ocimene (5.7%), geranyl acetate (3.1%), bornyl acetate (2.9%) and 
 <italic>cis-</italic>caryophyllene (2.6%). The other compounds were present at less than 2%. These results are similar with the results of previous reports [

 <xref rid="B24-molecules-25-02432" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Only a few fluctuations from other reports were found and are probably attributed to the origin of the plant samples or different extraction method. For the characteristic fishy scent and flavoring of 
 <italic>H. cordata</italic> essential oils is responsible compound houttuynin (decanoyl acetaldehyde). This compound was not identified in our essential oil due to its instability. It is usual that decanoyl acetaldehyde is during the process of distillation easily oxidized into 2-undecanone [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-25-02432" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This compound had the second highest concentration in our essential oil. Therefore, the amount of 2-undecanone is the primary indicator for the quality of 
 <italic>Houttuynia cordata</italic> essential oil [
