<p>In general, Gram-negative bacteria are more resistant to EOs than Gram-positive bacteria [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-25-02432" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. This is supported by our results because, as it is shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-02432-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, Gram-positive bacteria were more sensitive to tested EOs in comparison with Gram-negative bacteria. It is possible that active compounds in EOs can more easily break important bonds (peptidoglycan) in the cell wall structure of Gram-positive bacteria. The structure of the Gram-positive bacteria cell wall allows hydrophobic molecules to easily penetrate the cells and act on both the cell wall and within the cytoplasm. After the cell wall is broken, the reactive constituents of the essential oil can penetrate the interior of the cell and further damage its DNA. The other fact is that phenolic compounds, which are also present in the EOs, generally show antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria. On the other hand, the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria is far more complex, and it is, among other reasons, why they are more resistant to biologically active compounds (EOs) [
