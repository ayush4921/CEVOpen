<p>The most abundant compound in 
 <italic>H. cordata</italic> essential oil is myrcene. Myrcene has an antimicrobial activity and moreover enhances the activity of antibiotics [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-25-02432" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. EOs with a high content of myrcene have a positive effect on urinary and genital infections [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-25-02432" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-25-02432" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. These infections may be caused among others by 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic>; therefore, we could assume that EOs from 
 <italic>H. cordata</italic> will affect them, which has been confirmed in this study. The most abundant compound in 
 <italic>P. odorata</italic> essential oil was α-humulene, which is known for its anti-inflammatory effect. It is well known that EOs with α-humulene are natural antimicrobial agents [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-25-02432" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-25-02432" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-25-02432" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Pichette et al. [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-25-02432" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] have tested the antimicrobial activity of α-humulene against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> using the microdillution method. α-humulene exhibited an MIC of 2.6 μg∙mL
 <sup>−1</sup> against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and an MIC of more than 20 μg∙mL
 <sup>−1</sup> against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. Jang et al. [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-25-02432" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] have tested the antimicrobial activity of α-humulene against 
 <italic>B. fragilis</italic> and obtained MIC of 0.5 μg∙mL
 <sup>−1</sup>. The high content of α-humulene could be the reason why 
 <italic>P. odorata</italic> EOs inhibited the growth of six from eight tested bacteria. On the other hand, there is one possible disadvantage when using these oils orally or internally, which is possible irritation or allergy caused by 
 <italic>cis</italic>-caryophyllene, which both EOs contains [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-25-02432" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. It would be necessary to further examine the negative effect of each compound in the essential oil on the human body before using it for treating illness.
