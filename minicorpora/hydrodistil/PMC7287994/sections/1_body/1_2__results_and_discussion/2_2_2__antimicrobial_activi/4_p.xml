<p>As far as authors know, there are no previous reports about 
 <italic>Persicaria odorata</italic> and 
 <italic>Houttuynia cordata</italic> essential oils and its antimicrobial activity in the vapor phase, so it is not possible to further compare those results with other publications. However, there are some reports about testing the liquid phase of EOs from 
 <italic>Houttuynia cordata</italic>. Verma et al. [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-25-02432" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] tested the antimicrobial activity of the essential oil from 
 <italic>Houttuynia cordata</italic> against four bacteria (
 <italic>Staphylococcus aures</italic>, 
 <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic>, 
 <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic> and 
 <italic>Enteroccocus faecalis</italic>). Their essential oil exhibited MIC in the range of 0.52–1.04 μL∙mL
 <sup>−1</sup>. Ji et al. [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-25-02432" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] performed a disc diffusion test to determine antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic>H. cordata</italic> essential oil against 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>; unfortunately, the disc diffusion test is only a screening method, which is not possible to compare with MIC. Lu et al. [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-25-02432" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] tested the antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic>H. cordata</italic> EOs against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>Sarcina ureae</italic> using the broth and agar dilution method. Their reached minimal inhibitory concentration was in the range of 0.5–1.0 μL∙mL
