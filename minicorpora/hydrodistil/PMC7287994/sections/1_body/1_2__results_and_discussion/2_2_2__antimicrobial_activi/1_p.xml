<p>The antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic>H. cordata</italic> and 
 <italic>P. odorata</italic> essential oils is reported in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-02432-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Both EOs showed antimicrobial efficiency but in different concentrations. 
 <italic>H. cordata</italic> and 
 <italic>P. odorata</italic> essential oil expressed various antimicrobial activity in the range of 128–1024 μg∙mL
 <sup>−1</sup>, 512–1024 μg∙mL
 <sup>−1</sup> in broth and 1024 μg∙mL
 <sup>−1</sup>, 512–1024 μg∙mL
 <sup>−1</sup> in agar, respectively. In the liquid phase, the lowest MIC was showed for 
 <italic>H. cordata</italic> (128 μg∙mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) against 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic> and for 
 <italic>P. odorata</italic> (512 μg∙mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) against 
 <italic>S. pyogenes</italic>, 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic> and 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic>. In the vapor phase, the lowest MIC was observed for 
 <italic>H. cordata</italic> (1024 μg∙mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) against 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and for 
 <italic>P. odorata</italic> (512 μg∙mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. There are observable differences between the efficiency of the vapor and liquid phases of observed essential oils (EOs). In most cases, the higher MIC reached the liquid phase, except in the case of EOs from 
 <italic>P. odorata</italic> on 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, where the vapor phase was twice as effective as the liquid phase.
