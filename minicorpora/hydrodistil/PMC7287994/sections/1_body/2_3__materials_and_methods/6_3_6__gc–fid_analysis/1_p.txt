0: The GCFID analysis of samples was carried out by using a Gas Chromatograph GC 2010 with a flame ionization detector (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) and Autosampler Combi Pal (CTC Analytics, AG, Zwingen, Swizerland) on a capillary column SLB-5ms Supelco (30 m  0.25 mm, 2.5 m film thickness; Bellefonte, PA, USA).
1: The GCFID conditions were the same as in case of GCMS analysis.
2: The injector temperature was set at 200 C and the detector temperature was set at 260 C. A total of 1 L of diluted essential oil (200 times,  n-hexane) was injected with a split ratio 1:50.
3: As in the case of GCMS, experimental retention indices were calculated and compared to published data.
