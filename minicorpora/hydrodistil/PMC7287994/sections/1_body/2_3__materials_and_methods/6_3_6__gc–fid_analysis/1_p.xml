<p>The GC–FID analysis of samples was carried out by using a Gas Chromatograph GC 2010 with a flame ionization detector (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) and Autosampler Combi Pal (CTC Analytics, AG, Zwingen, Swizerland) on a capillary column SLB-5ms Supelco (30 m × 0.25 mm, 2.5 μm film thickness; Bellefonte, PA, USA). The GC–FID conditions were the same as in case of GC–MS analysis. The injector temperature was set at 200 °C and the detector temperature was set at 260 °C. A total of 1 µL of diluted essential oil (200 times, 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane) was injected with a split ratio 1:50. As in the case of GC–MS, experimental retention indices were calculated and compared to published data.
