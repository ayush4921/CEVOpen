0: Four Gram-negative and four Gram-positive bacteria that caused respiratory infections, including upper and lower airway diseases, were chosen.
1: Standard strains were used for the experiment:  Escherichia coli CCM 3954,  Pseudomonas aeruginosa CCM 3955,  Klebsiella pneumoniae NPK12,  Serratia marcescens CCM 303,  Staphylococcus aureus CCM 4223,  Enterococcus faecalis CCM 4224,  Streptococcus pyogenes NPK01 and  Bacillus subtilis CCM 2215.
2: All standard strains were purchased from Czech Collection of Microorganisms (CCM), Brno, Czech Republic.
3: Bacteria were incubated at 37 C for 24 h. Prior to the experiment, bacterial suspensions with turbidity according to the McFarland scale were prepared corresponding to the grade 0.5 (~1.5  10 8 CFUmL 1).
4: The cultivation and assay media were Mueller-Hinton (agar and broth; Himedia, India).
5: The pH of the broth was adjusted to a final value of 7.6 using Trizma base and hydrochloric acid (both Himedia, India).
6: Ampicilin (St. Louis, MO, USA) was used as a positive antibiotic control.
