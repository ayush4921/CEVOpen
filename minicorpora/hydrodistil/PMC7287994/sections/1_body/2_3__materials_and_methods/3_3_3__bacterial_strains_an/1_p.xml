<p>Four Gram-negative and four Gram-positive bacteria that caused respiratory infections, including upper and lower airway diseases, were chosen. Standard strains were used for the experiment: 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> CCM 3954, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> CCM 3955, 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> NPK12, 
 <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic> CCM 303, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> CCM 4223, 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> CCM 4224, 
 <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> NPK01 and 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> CCM 2215. All standard strains were purchased from Czech Collection of Microorganisms (CCM), Brno, Czech Republic. Bacteria were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Prior to the experiment, bacterial suspensions with turbidity according to the McFarland scale were prepared corresponding to the grade 0.5 (~1.5 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>). The cultivation and assay media were Mueller-Hinton (agar and broth; Himedia, India). The pH of the broth was adjusted to a final value of 7.6 using Trizma base and hydrochloric acid (both Himedia, India). Ampicilin (St. Louis, MO, USA) was used as a positive antibiotic control.
