<p>The antimicrobial activity of the liquid and vapor phase of Eos was determined by the broth microdilution volatilization method [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-25-02432" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The experiments were carried out in 96-well microtiter plates with one well volume of 400 µL. The test is designed for the testing of 6 essential oils in total. For this study, we tested only 2 essential oils, and different samples were in other wells. The plates were covered with wooden plates and clamped to prevent vapor phase leakage. The edge wells were left blank to avoid the edge effect. First, essential oil samples were prepared as follows: approximately 2 µL of EOs was added to corresponding amount of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at a concentration of 1%, then further diluted in the corresponding broth to initial concentration. Then, the antibiotic was prepared at an initial concentration of 4 µg∙mL
 <sup>−1</sup>. In the first part of the experiment, 30 µL of agar was pipetted onto the plate lid and inoculated with 5 µL of bacterial suspension for vapor phase testing. In the second part (liquid phase assay), 100 µL of buffered Mueller-Hinton broth was pipetted into the wells. Each well had a final volume of 100 µL. Seven two-fold diluted concentrations of samples starting at a concentration of 1024 µg∙mL
 <sup>−1</sup> were prepared for each essential oil in one row. A positive and negative control of bacterial growth was prepared in the first two columns. In the last column, 6 two-fold diluted concentrations of antibiotic starting at 4 µg∙mL
 <sup>−1</sup> were prepared. Finally, all wells except the negative control were inoculated with 5 µL of bacterial suspension. Plates were closed, fixed and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. After incubation, minimal inhibitory concentrations of EOs were evaluated by the visual assessment of bacterial growth after the coloring of a metabolically active bacterial colony with thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide dye (MTT; Sigma Aldrich, Prague, Czech Republic). A total of 25 µL of 600 µg∙mL
 <sup>−1</sup> dye was applied to the lid and each well of the plate and equilibrated for 10 min. The color changed from yellow (dead cells) to purple (live cells). Thereafter, the MICs were recorded. All experiments were performed in triplicate in three independent experiments. The results were expressed as the median of minimal inhibition concentration of the antimicrobial agent values.
