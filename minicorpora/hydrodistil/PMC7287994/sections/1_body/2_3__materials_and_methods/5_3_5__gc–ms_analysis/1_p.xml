<p>The GC–MS analysis of samples was carried out by using a Gas Chromatograph GC 2010 coupled to a Mass Selective Detector GCMS-QP2010 Plus (both Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) and Combi Pal Autosampler (CTC Analytics, AG, Zwingen, Swizerland) on a capillary column SLB-5ms Supelco (30 m × 0.25 mm, 2.5 μm film thickness; Bellefonte, PA, USA). The carrier gas was Helium 5.0 (Linde, Prague, Czech Republic) with a constant flow of 30 cm·s
 <sup>−1</sup>. The oven temperature program was set at an initial temperature of 40 °C for 3 min, then heated up to 250 °C at 2 °C·min
 <sup>−1</sup> and held at 250 °C for 10 min. The injector and detector temperatures were set at 200 °C. The mass spectrometry detector was operated under electron ionization mode at ionization energy of 70 eV when ions with

 <italic>z</italic> 33–500 were scanned. A total of 1 µL of diluted essential oil (200 times, 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane) was injected with a split ratio 1:50. The experimental results of retention indices were calculated relative to C8–C33 
 <italic>n</italic>-alkanes in concentrations of 100–200 µg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>, dissolved in 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane (Restek, Bellefonte, PA, USA). The calculation was performed according to the van den Dool and Kratz method, and the results were further compared to published data [
