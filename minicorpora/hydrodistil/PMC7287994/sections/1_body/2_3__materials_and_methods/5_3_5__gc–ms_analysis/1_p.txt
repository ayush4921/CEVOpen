0: The GCMS analysis of samples was carried out by using a Gas Chromatograph GC 2010 coupled to a Mass Selective Detector GCMS-QP2010 Plus (both Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) and Combi Pal Autosampler (CTC Analytics, AG, Zwingen, Swizerland) on a capillary column SLB-5ms Supelco (30 m  0.25 mm, 2.5 m film thickness; Bellefonte, PA, USA).
1: The carrier gas was Helium 5.0 (Linde, Prague, Czech Republic) with a constant flow of 30 cms 1.
2: The oven temperature program was set at an initial temperature of 40 C for 3 min, then heated up to 250 C at 2 Cmin 1 and held at 250 C for 10 min.
3: The injector and detector temperatures were set at 200 C. The mass spectrometry detector was operated under electron ionization mode at ionization energy of 70 eV when ions with  m/ z 33500 were scanned.
4: A total of 1 L of diluted essential oil (200 times,  n-hexane) was injected with a split ratio 1:50.
5: The experimental results of retention indices were calculated relative to C8C33  n-alkanes in concentrations of 100200 gmL 1, dissolved in  n-hexane (Restek, Bellefonte, PA, USA).
6: The calculation was performed according to the van den Dool and Kratz method, and the results were further compared to published data [ 36, 37].
7: Compounds were identified by comparing their mass spectra with mass spectra of several standards ( Table 1) and commercial mass spectral databases NIST14 Mass Spectral Library and FFNSC 2 GC/MS Library Release 2.0 (Flavor and Fragrance Natural and Synthetic Compounds Library) and further checked out by manual mass spectra evaluation.
