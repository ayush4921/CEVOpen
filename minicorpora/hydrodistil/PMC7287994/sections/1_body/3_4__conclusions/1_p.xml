<p>This study shows new interesting knowledge about EOs distilled from two Asian herbsâ€”
 <italic>Persicaria odorata</italic> and 
 <italic>Houttuynia cordata</italic>. The chemical composition of EOs corresponds to previous studies with a minor deviation that may be caused by agronomic factors, sample storage or sample preparation and other factors. Both EOs showed antimicrobial activity in different concentrations to different bacteria. Due to great antibacterial activity, along with the composition of Eos, we see a great potential for future usages of these oils, such as natural antimicrobials or food preservatives. As far as we know, we were the first to describe the antimicrobial properties of those EOs in both vapor and liquid phases on eight selected bacteria. Furthermore, it is necessary to study the possible cytotoxicity of these oils. The disadvantage is that both oils contain 
 <italic>cis</italic>-caryophyllene that causes allergic reactions and skin irritation. It would be necessary to find the balance in concentrations of beneficial antimicrobial active compounds and potentially toxic compounds.
