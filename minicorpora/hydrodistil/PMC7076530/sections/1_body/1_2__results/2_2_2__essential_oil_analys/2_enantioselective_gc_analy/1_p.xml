<p>The enantioselective analysis of the EO was carried out with a β-cyclodextrine-based GC column, coated with 2,3-diacethyl-6-tert-butylsilyl-β-cyclodextrin as chiral selector. The analysis was performed on two of the four major compounds (α-pinene and β-pinene), with myrcene being a non-chiral molecule and limonene enantiomers not being separable with this chiral selector. The results of the enantioselective analysis are shown in
