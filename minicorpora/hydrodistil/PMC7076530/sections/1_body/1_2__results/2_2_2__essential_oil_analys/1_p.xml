<p>The EO distillation produced a yield of 1.09 ± 0.10 % (
 <italic>w/w</italic>, referred to dry fruits). In the chemical analysis of the EO of 
 <italic>S. echinata</italic>, a total of twenty-seven and nineteen compounds were identified and quantified, respectively, with DB-5ms and HP-INNOWax columns. The EO was mainly composed of monoterpene hydrocarbons, corresponding to 84.8% and 89.7% of the total composition, respectively. Major compounds were α-pinene (24.3%, 20.3%), β-pinene (21.7%, 22.7%), β-myrcene (11.3%, 14.8%), limonene (10.0%, 11.3%), 
 <italic>cis</italic>-ocimene (8.5%, 8.1%), and 
 <italic>trans</italic>-ocimene (8.9%, 8.4%). The chemical composition of the EO is shown in 
 <xref rid="plants-09-00187-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> according to the elution order in DB-5ms.
