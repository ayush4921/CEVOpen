<p>Furthermore, the essential oil of 
 <italic>S. echinata</italic> was qualitatively and quantitatively characterized for the first time. A total of 27 and 19 compounds were identified and quantified in a non-polar and polar column, respectively. Major compounds were α-pinene (24.3%, 20.3%), β-pinene (21.7%, 22.7%), β-myrcene (11.3%, 14.8%), limonene (10.0%, 11.3%), 
 <italic>cis</italic>-ocimene (8.5%, 8.1%), and 
 <italic>trans</italic>-ocimene (8.9%, 8.4%). The enantioselective analysis performed on major monoterpenes indicated (+)-α-pinene as enantiomerically pure and (+)-β-pinene with 6.7% of enantiomeric excess.
