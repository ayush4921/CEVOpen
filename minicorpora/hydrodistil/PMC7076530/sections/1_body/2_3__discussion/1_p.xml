<p>Sipaucins are rare sesquiterpenoids that have been described for the first time in 2003 in 
 <italic>S. pauciflora</italic> [
 <xref rid="B8-plants-09-00187" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and not yet found in other species until now. As these metabolites could be characteristic of 
 <italic>Siparuna</italic> genus, we decided to selectively search for them in the ethyl acetate extract, performing a single ion monitoring (SIM) GC-MS analysis. In the chromatogram of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00187-f001">Figure 1</xref>, all the peaks consistent with the selected ions are shown. In particular, peak 1, 2, and 3 represent compounds whose ions and relative abundance are, respectively, compatible with Sipaucin A, B, and C. It should be underlined that these peaks are quite evident only in SIM analysis and splitless injection, demonstrating that they actually correspond to minor constituents of the extract. This fact could justify the low yield of Sipaucin A and the non-obtention of other Sipaucins. The presence of more than three peaks, all being compatible with this family of metabolites suggests that other new related compounds are possibly produced by 
 <italic>S. echinata</italic>, though there is no evidence of the certain presence of these molecules in the extract.
