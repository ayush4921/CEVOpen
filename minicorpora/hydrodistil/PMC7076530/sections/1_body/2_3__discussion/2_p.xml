<p>Concerning the chemical composition of the volatile fraction, the EOs from other species of genus 
 <italic>Siparuna</italic> were mainly based on sesquiterpenes: 
 <italic>S. aspera</italic> and 
 <italic>S. macrotepala</italic> presented as major compounds germacrene D (23.2%, 42.1%), bicyclogermacrene (7.8%, 11.8%), and α-pinene (7.0%, 1.8%) [
 <xref rid="B34-plants-09-00187" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], while in the essential oil of 
 <italic>S. eggersii</italic> the principal components were epicurzerenone (29.9%), germacrone (10.5%), and caryophyllene oxide (29.0%) [
 <xref rid="B23-plants-09-00187" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. On the other hand, our EO was mainly composed of monoterpenes, with α-pinene (24.3%), β-pinene (21.7%), β-myrcene (11.3), and limonene (10.0%) being major constituents.
