<p>An amount of 10 g of extract was eluted on C-18 reversed phase, in order to completely remove chlorophylls. The elution was performed isocratically with a mixture of methanol/water in the ratio of 85:15, producing 5 g of chlorophyll-free extract. To prove the presence of Sipaucins, 20 mg of chlorophyll-free extract was dissolved in 1 mL of dichloromethane and the solution (1 μL) was injected in splitless mode in GC-MS (DB-5ms column). The elution was conducted with a thermal gradient, according to the following program: the initial temperature was 50 °C maintained for 3 min, followed by a thermal gradient of 10 °C/min until the temperature of 250 °C, that was maintained for 17 min. The injector temperature was set at 250 °C and the carrier gas (helium) at 1 mL/min (constant flow). The SIM method is described in
