<p>The preparative purification by CC was performed from 2 g of chlorophyll-free extract. Silica gel (200 g) was packed in a glass column (50 mm Ã— 800 mm), and the extract was eluted in fractions with varying ratios of eluent mixture hexane/EtOAc from 100% hexane until 100% EtOAc. A total of 14 fractions were obtained (JK01-JK14), according to TLC profiles.</p>
