0: An amount of 10 g of extract was eluted on C-18 reversed phase, in order to completely remove chlorophylls.
1: The elution was performed isocratically with a mixture of methanol/water in the ratio of 85:15, producing 5 g of chlorophyll-free extract.
2: To prove the presence of Sipaucins, 20 mg of chlorophyll-free extract was dissolved in 1 mL of dichloromethane and the solution (1 L) was injected in splitless mode in GC-MS (DB-5ms column).
3: The elution was conducted with a thermal gradient, according to the following program: the initial temperature was 50 C maintained for 3 min, followed by a thermal gradient of 10 C/min until the temperature of 250 C, that was maintained for 17 min.
4: The injector temperature was set at 250 C and the carrier gas (helium) at 1 mL/min (constant flow).
5: The SIM method is described in  Table 3.
