0: The quantitative analysis was performed by GC-FID, applying the same method and equipment conditions described above.
1: Quantification was performed with external calibration curve and internal standard.
2: Two calibration curves were obtained, injecting six dilutions of isopropyl caproate (calibration standard) and  n-nonane (internal standard) in both columns.
3: The dilutions were obtained by diluting 0.8 mg, 1.8 mg, 4.1 mg, 8.3 mg, 16.9 mg, and 34.5 mg of isopropyl caproate and an exactly weighed amount of 7.67.8 mg of  n-nonane to 10 mL with cyclohexane.
4: All calibration curves achieved a R 2 > 0.995.
5: The relative response factor (RRF) of each constituent of the EO versus isopropyl caproate was calculated, according to combustion enthalpy [ 36], prior to calibration.
