<p>The qualitative analysis was performed by injecting 1 μL of the EO solution (split 40:1) with the following thermal program. The initial oven temperature was 60 °C for 5 min, followed by a thermal gradient of 3 °C/min up to 180 °C and 15 °C/min up to 250 °C. The final temperature was maintained for 5 min. The injector temperature was set at 250°C, the carrier gas (helium) was set at 1 mL/min (constant flow). Additionally, a mixture of 
 <italic>n</italic>-alkanes (C
 <sub>9</sub>–C
 <sub>25</sub>) was injected under the same conditions to determine the linear retention indices (LRIs).
