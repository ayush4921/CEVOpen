0: The enantioselective analysis was performed by GC-MS on the same samples of the qualitative and quantitative analyses, according to the following method.
1: The initial oven temperature was 60 C for 2 min, followed by a thermal gradient of 2 C/min until 220 C, maintained for 2 min.
2: Also, in this case, a mixture of  n-alkanes (C 9C 25) was injected under the same conditions to calculate LRIs.
3: The elution order of the enantiomeric pairs was determined according to literature data for the same chiral selector [ 37].
