0: The qualitative analysis was performed by injecting 1 L of the EO solution (split 40:1) with the following thermal program.
1: The initial oven temperature was 60 C for 5 min, followed by a thermal gradient of 3 C/min up to 180 C and 15 C/min up to 250 C. The final temperature was maintained for 5 min.
2: The injector temperature was set at 250C, the carrier gas (helium) was set at 1 mL/min (constant flow).
3: Additionally, a mixture of  n-alkanes (C 9C 25) was injected under the same conditions to determine the linear retention indices (LRIs).
