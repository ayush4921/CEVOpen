0: The analytical samples were prepared by diluting an exactly weighed amount of essential oil (corresponding to 10 L) with 1 mL of internal standard solution, previously prepared by diluting 0.7 mg of  n-nonane to a total volume of 10 mL with cyclohexane.
1: Such a preparation was repeated for each sample.
2: These samples were directly used for the qualitative, quantitative, and enantioselective analyses.
