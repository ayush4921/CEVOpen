<p>The enantioselective analysis was performed by GC-MS on the same samples of the qualitative and quantitative analyses, according to the following method. The initial oven temperature was 60 °C for 2 min, followed by a thermal gradient of 2 °C/min until 220 °C, maintained for 2 min. Also, in this case, a mixture of 
 <italic>n</italic>-alkanes (C
 <sub>9</sub>–C
 <sub>25</sub>) was injected under the same conditions to calculate LRIs. The elution order of the enantiomeric pairs was determined according to literature data for the same chiral selector [
