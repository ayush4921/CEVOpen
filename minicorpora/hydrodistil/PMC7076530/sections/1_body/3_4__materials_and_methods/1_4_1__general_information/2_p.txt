0: The GC-MS analyses were performed on an Agilent Technologies (Wilmington, DE, USA) 6890N gas chromatograph coupled to a mass spectrometer detector (MSD) Agilent Technologies 5973N.
1: For both GC-MS and gas chromatographyflame ionization detector (GC-FID) analyses, the instrument was equipped with a DB-5ms Agilent 122-5532 column (length 30 m, 0.25 mm internal diameter and 0.25 m stationary phase thickness) and a HP-INNOWax column (length 30 m, 0.25 mm internal diameter and 0.25 m stationary phase thickness).
2: The MSD was equipped with an electron impact ion source, operating at 70 eV.
3: The ion analyzer was operated in SCAN mode for the EO analysis (35350 amu) and SIM mode for Sipaucins detection.
