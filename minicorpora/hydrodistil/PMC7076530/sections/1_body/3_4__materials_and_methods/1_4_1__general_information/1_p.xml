<p>The NMR spectra were performed in a Varian spectrometer (Walnut Creek, CA, USA, 400 MHz for 
 <sup>1</sup>H and 100 MHz for 
 <sup>13</sup>C) in CDCl
 <sub>3</sub> (from Sigma Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA). The chemical shifts were reported in Î´ (ppm), relative to the signal of tetramethylsilane (TMS) and the coupling constants (
 <italic>J</italic>) in Hz.
