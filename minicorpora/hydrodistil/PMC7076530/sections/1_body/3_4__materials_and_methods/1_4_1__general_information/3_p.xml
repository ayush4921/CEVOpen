<p>The enantioselective GC analysis was carried out with an enantioselective capillary column, based on 2,3-diacethyl-6-
 <italic>tert</italic>-butylsilyl-β-cyclodextrin as chiral selector (25 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm, purchased from MEGA, Milan, Italy), installed in the same GC-MS system. Helium was used as carrier gas (Indura, Guayaquil, Ecuador).
