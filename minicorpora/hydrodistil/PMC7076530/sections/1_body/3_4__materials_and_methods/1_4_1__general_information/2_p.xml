<p>The GC-MS analyses were performed on an Agilent Technologies (Wilmington, DE, USA) 6890N gas chromatograph coupled to a mass spectrometer detector (MSD) Agilent Technologies 5973N. For both GC-MS and gas chromatography–flame ionization detector (GC-FID) analyses, the instrument was equipped with a DB-5ms Agilent 122-5532 column (length 30 m, 0.25 mm internal diameter and 0.25 μm stationary phase thickness) and a HP-INNOWax column (length 30 m, 0.25 mm internal diameter and 0.25 μm stationary phase thickness). The MSD was equipped with an electron impact ion source, operating at 70 eV. The ion analyzer was operated in SCAN mode for the EO analysis (35–350 amu) and SIM mode for Sipaucins’ detection.</p>
