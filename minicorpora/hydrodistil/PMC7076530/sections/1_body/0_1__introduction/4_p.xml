<p>In this work, we focused on some new terpenoids called Sipaucins, recently discovered in the species 
 <italic>Siparuna pauciflora</italic> and described so far only once in literature [
 <xref rid="B8-plants-09-00187" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Furthermore, 
 <italic>Siparuna</italic> spp. often produce a volatile fraction that appeared to be abundant in fruits of 
 <italic>S. echinata</italic>, justifying the study of the essential oil (EO).
