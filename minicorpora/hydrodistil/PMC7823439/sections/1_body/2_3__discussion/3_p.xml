<p>A high percentage of paralyzed J2s was recorded after incubating juveniles for 24, 48, and 96 h. The EO and HL of 
 <italic>C. cyminum</italic> seem to have remarkable nematicidal activity against 
 <italic>M. incognita</italic> and 
 <italic>M. javanica</italic>. There was a drastic increase in J2 paralysis when the concentration was increased from 31.2 to 62.5 μL/L. The juveniles’ paralysis remained constantly high upon a further increase in the concentration to 500 μL/L. Other researchers, working with plant extracts, also reported an effective nematicidal action in J2s. Laquale et al. [
 <xref rid="B29-plants-10-00046" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] reported a strong action of EOs isolated from two Italian ecotypes of 
 <italic>Monarda</italic> species. Those essential oils had as constituents, among others, γ-terpinene and 
 <italic>o</italic>-cymene, which are also present in 
 <italic>C. cyminum</italic>. Faria et al. [
 <xref rid="B30-plants-10-00046" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], working with isolated EOs from 56 plant samples, found that some of the most successful EOs were those containing 2-undecanone, ascaridol, carvacrol, methyl salicylate, 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene, and γ-terpinene. Although a straight comparison cannot be made, since essential oils always have different constituents in a different ratio, it seems that 
 <italic>C. cyminum</italic> EO contains some of the most well-known nematicidal compounds, which were responsible for the high efficacy of the tested extract against 
 <italic>M. incognita</italic> and 
 <italic>M. javanica</italic> J2s. An increased number of paralyzed J2s were recorded upon increasing the exposure time (from 24 to 96 h) or the concentration of EO. The hydrosol of 
 <italic>C. cyminum</italic> showed lower nematicidal activity, and J2 paralysis was always less than that observed using EO.
