 <italic>C. cyminum</italic> essential oil significantly inhibited egg differentiation. This was noticeable even at the 7.8 μL/L concentration for both nematode species tested. Egg differentiation remained constantly low as the concentration was increased to 250 (
 <italic>M. javanica</italic>) and 125 μL/L (
 <italic>M. incognita</italic>). A further concentration increase resulted in an even lower egg differentiation rate. The use of 
 <italic>C. cyminum</italic> HL was also effective in decreasing egg differentiation for both species. When HL was tested on the differentiation of 
 <italic>M. javanica</italic> eggs, a significant decrease was observed upon increasing the concentration to 0.05 
 <italic>v/v</italic>, while a constant decrease was observed upon increasing the concentration to 0.5 
 <italic>v/v</italic>. This decrease in egg differentiation correlated with an increase in concentration when 
 <italic>M. incognita</italic> eggs were used, although this was not as obvious as observed in 
 <italic>M. javanica</italic>.
