<p>All in vitro tests were performed in Cellstar
 <sup>®</sup> flat-bottom 24-well plates. Solutions of 
 <italic>C. cyminum</italic> essential oil were tested for J2 motility at the doses of 0, 7.8, 15.6, 31.2, 62.5, 125, 250, and 500 μL/L. The essential oil was dissolved in ethanol (Sigma-Aldrich; Italy) and serially diluted in distilled water containing Tween-20 to produce test solutions of the above concentrations. The ethanol and Tween-20 concentrations (1% and 0.2%, respectively) were tested in preliminary tests which showed no effect on nematodes. The hydrosol dilutions (in distilled water) tested for J2 motility were 1% (0.01), 2% (0.02), 5% (0.05), 10% (0.1) 20% (0.2), and 50% (0.5) (

An inverted microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) at 100× magnification was used for the J2 observation after 24, 48, and 96 h of incubation time. The juveniles were scored as motile or paralyzed after 10 s of observation. If there was lack of movement, the J2s were considered paralyzed. Each experiment was conducted twice, and every treatment was replicated five times per trial.
