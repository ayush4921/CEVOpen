3: The infestation of seedlings took place when the plants were 4 weeks old, at the four-leaf stage.
4: After 40 days, the infested plants were uprooted, and the roots washed free of soil.
5: Eggs of  Meloidogyne populations were extracted using 1% sodium hypochlorite solution (Hussey and Barker 1973).
6: Second-stage juveniles (J2s) were hatched in a modified Baermann funnel, where the eggs were placed.
