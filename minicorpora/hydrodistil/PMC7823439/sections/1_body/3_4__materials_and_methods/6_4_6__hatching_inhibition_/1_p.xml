<p>Mature egg masses (dark yellow color) of 
 <italic>Meloidogyne incognita</italic> and 
 <italic>M. javanica</italic> were handpicked using sterilized forceps from roots free of soil. Egg masses were placed in small plastic extraction trays made using 6 cm diameter Petri dishes (one egg mass per extracting tray). Solutions of 
 <italic>C. cyminum</italic> essential oil (7.8, 15.6, 31.2, 62.5, 125, 250, and 500 μL/L) or hydrosol (0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) were added to each extracting tray to cover egg masses. Egg masses were maintained for 7 days, and all J2s hatched in test solutions were collected and counted. Then, test solutions were removed by washing them with tap water and placed in new extracting trays filled with clean water. Extracting trays were covered with aluminum foil to avoid evaporation and placed in an incubator at 26 ± 1 °C. After 7 days, all J2s in Petri dishes were counted; then, they were discarded, and the water was substituted with fresh water. The same procedure was repeated every 7 days. The experiment was terminated when J2s no longer emerged, 35 days later. Then, every egg mass was handpicked from Petri dishes, placed in a drop of water on a glass slide, and squashed using a coverslip; all unhatched eggs were counted using an inverted microscope to obtain the total number of eggs at the beginning of the hatching test (hatched + unhatched eggs). The percentage hatch was calculated as the ratio between hatched J2s and the total number of eggs. The experiment was carried out twice, and each treatment was replicated five times per trial.
