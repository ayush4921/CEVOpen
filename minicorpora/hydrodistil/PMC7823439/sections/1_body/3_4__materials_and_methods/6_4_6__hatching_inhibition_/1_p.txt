0: Mature egg masses (dark yellow color) of  Meloidogyne incognita and  M. javanica were handpicked using sterilized forceps from roots free of soil.
1: Egg masses were placed in small plastic extraction trays made using 6 cm diameter Petri dishes (one egg mass per extracting tray).
2: Solutions of  C. cyminum essential oil (7.8, 15.6, 31.2, 62.5, 125, 250, and 500 L/L) or hydrosol (0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5  v/ v) were added to each extracting tray to cover egg masses.
3: Egg masses were maintained for 7 days, and all J2s hatched in test solutions were collected and counted.
4: Then, test solutions were removed by washing them with tap water and placed in new extracting trays filled with clean water.
5: Extracting trays were covered with aluminum foil to avoid evaporation and placed in an incubator at 26  1 C. After 7 days, all J2s in Petri dishes were counted; then, they were discarded, and the water was substituted with fresh water.
6: The same procedure was repeated every 7 days.
7: The experiment was terminated when J2s no longer emerged, 35 days later.
8: Then, every egg mass was handpicked from Petri dishes, placed in a drop of water on a glass slide, and squashed using a coverslip; all unhatched eggs were counted using an inverted microscope to obtain the total number of eggs at the beginning of the hatching test (hatched + unhatched eggs).
9: The percentage hatch was calculated as the ratio between hatched J2s and the total number of eggs.
10: The experiment was carried out twice, and each treatment was replicated five times per trial.
