0: Seeds were purchased from a commercial supplier in Athens, Greece.
1: The essential oil was isolated from seeds of  C. cyminum via hydrodistillation (HD) for 3 h in a 5 L Clevenger-type apparatus.
2: The essential oil was dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO 4).
3: The hydrosol was collected in a separate glass bottle.
4: A part of it was extracted using diethyl ether in order to isolate the volatile compounds.
5: The organic phase was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and reduced to a final volume.
6: Both the essential oil and the organic phase were stored at 18 C until their analysis.
7: The determination of the chemical composition of the plant isolates was achieved using the gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GCMS) technique with a Trace Ultra Gas Chromatographer coupled to a DSQ II Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Scientific), fitted with a TR-5MS (30 m  0.25 mm  0.25 m) capillary column (Thermo Scientific).
8: The injector and MS transfer line temperatures were set at 220 and 250 C, respectively.
9: Experimental conditions included an oven GC temperature programmed from 60 to 250 C at a rate of 3 C/min.
10: Helium was used as the carrier gas at 1 mL/min flow rate.
11: A quantity of 1.0 L of the diluted samples in the case of EO (1/1000 in acetone,  v/ v) or of the organic phase were injected manually in splitless mode.
12: The MS was operated in electrospray ionization (EI) mode at 70 eV, with an ion source temperature of 240 C, whereas mass spectra were acquired in scan mode for a mass range of 35400.
13: Tentative identification of the compounds was achieved on the basis of a comparison of their relative retention indices and mass spectra with corresponding data reported in the literature and the instruments databases [Adams Book 07, Nist 98, Xcalibur].
14: The relative retention indices (RRIs) of compounds were determined with reference to the retention times of C 8C 24n-alkanes.
15: Relative percentages of the compounds were obtained electronically from area percentage data.
