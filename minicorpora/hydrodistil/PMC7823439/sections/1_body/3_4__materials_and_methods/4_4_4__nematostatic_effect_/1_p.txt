0: C. cyminum EO was dissolved in ethanol, and solutions at 0, 62.5, 150, and 500 L/L concentrations were produced after serially diluting in distilled water containing Tween-20.
1: One hundred milliliters of each solution containing approximately 5000 J2s was transferred to a 250 mL Erlemeyer flask.
2: Oxygen was supplied throughout the experiment using plastic tubes connected to an air pump.
3: Distilled water and water with ethanol and Tween-20 were used as controls.
4: Twelve hours later, two 5 mL solutions were removed from each flask and placed into wells in Cellstar  flat-bottom 24-well plates.
5: The first 5 mL solution, containing approximately 250 J2s, was placed into wells (1 mL per well) just after removal from the flask, observed using an inverted microscope, and categorized as motile or paralyzed (T0).
6: After counting, all J2s were discarded.
7: The second 5 mL solution was rinsed in tap water using a 20 m sieve, collected in a beaker, and placed in wells (1 mL per well containing approximately 50 J2s).
8: After 12 h (T12), motile and paralyzed J2s were observed using an inverted microscope (100).
9: J2s were remained in wells, and another two counts were performed after 24 (T24) and 48 (T48) h. No motility regained was evidence of nematicidal activity (permanent death) of the EO.
10: The experiment was carried out twice and every treatment was replicated five times per trial.
