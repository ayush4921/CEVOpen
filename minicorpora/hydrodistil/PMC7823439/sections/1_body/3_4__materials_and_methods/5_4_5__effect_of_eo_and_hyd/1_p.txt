0: Eggs of the two species of nematodes were extracted from tomato ( Solanum lycopersicum cv.
1: Belladona) roots, using the hypochlorite method [ 32].
2: The suspension of eggs was placed on a sieve (pore size 38m), thoroughly rinsed with tap water, and collected into a 100 mL beaker.
3: The suspension of eggs was quantified with the aid of an inverted microscope (100), and the number of eggs per mL was adjusted and used directly in the bioassays.
4: Essential oil solutions, at 0, 7.8, 15.6, 31.2, 62.5, 125, 250, and 500 L/L concentrations (in ethanol and Tween-20), and hydrosol dilutions (in distilled water) at 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5  v/v concentrations were tested on the development of eggs.
5: The solutions were prepared as previously described.
6: Distilled water was used as a control.
7: Approximately 50 eggs per well, of which 90% were undifferentiated (eggs containing only cells), were exposed to either EO or HL solutions and incubated at 26  1 C. All plates were covered with aluminum foil to avoid evaporation.
8: For monitoring egg differentiation, eggs were observed on day 0 and day 28, with the aid of an inverted microscope (Zeiss, Germany) at 100 magnification.
9: The experiment was carried out twice, and each treatment was replicated five times.
