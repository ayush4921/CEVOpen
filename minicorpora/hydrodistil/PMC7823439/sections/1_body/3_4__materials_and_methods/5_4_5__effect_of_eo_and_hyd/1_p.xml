<p>Eggs of the two species of nematodes were extracted from tomato (
 <italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic> cv. Belladona) roots, using the hypochlorite method [
 <xref rid="B32-plants-10-00046" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The suspension of eggs was placed on a sieve (pore size 38μm), thoroughly rinsed with tap water, and collected into a 100 mL beaker. The suspension of eggs was quantified with the aid of an inverted microscope (100×), and the number of eggs per mL was adjusted and used directly in the bioassays. Essential oil solutions, at 0, 7.8, 15.6, 31.2, 62.5, 125, 250, and 500 μL/L concentrations (in ethanol and Tween-20), and hydrosol dilutions (in distilled water) at 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 
 <italic>v/v</italic> concentrations were tested on the development of eggs. The solutions were prepared as previously described. Distilled water was used as a control. Approximately 50 eggs per well, of which 90% were undifferentiated (eggs containing only cells), were exposed to either EO or HL solutions and incubated at 26 ± 1 °C. All plates were covered with aluminum foil to avoid evaporation. For monitoring egg differentiation, eggs were observed on day 0 and day 28, with the aid of an inverted microscope (Zeiss, Germany) at 100× magnification. The experiment was carried out twice, and each treatment was replicated five times.
