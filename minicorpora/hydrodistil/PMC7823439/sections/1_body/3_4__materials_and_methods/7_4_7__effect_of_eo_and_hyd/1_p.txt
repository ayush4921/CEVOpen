0: A soil collected at Gargalianoi village (Peloponnese, Greece) was autoclaved to kill any plant parasitic nematodes and then used in the experiment to verify the effects of C.  cyminum EO and HL against  M. javanica J2s.
1: EO solutions at 7.8, 15.6, 31.2, 62.5, 125, 250, and 500 L/L concentrations, and HL dilutions (in distilled water) at 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.5  v/v concentrations were tested on J2s in soil.
2: Five plastic pots (9 cm deep and 5 cm diameter) per treatment were filled with 350 g of the treated soil, and 60 mL of the test solutions were applied in each pot.
3: After 2 h, 1 mL of a suspension containing 500 J2s was used for inoculation by making one hole in the center of each pot.
4: Pots were covered with aluminum foil to avoid water evaporation and maintained at 25  1 C for 24 h to be sure that juveniles were in contact with the chemicals.
5: Then, a seedling of tomato (cv Belladonna) at the four-leaf stage was transplanted in the center of each pot.
6: All plants were placed in a growth room at 25  1 C with a 16 h photoperiod; 28 days later, they were uprooted, stems were removed, and roots were gently washed free of soil.
7: Roots were stained using acid fuchsin as described in Byrd et al.
8: [ 33].
9: Roots were then washed in water and placed in vials containing equal volumes of glycerol and distilled water.
10: Female nematodes were counted in the whole root system of each plant using a stereoscopic microscope at 12.5 magnification.
11: All treatments were replicated five times per trial, while the experiment was performed twice.
