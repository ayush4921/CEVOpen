<p>Plant parasitic nematodes belonging to the genus 
 <italic>Meloidogyne</italic> are one of the most widespread and destructive groups of plant parasites, and their control is extremely challenging [
 <xref rid="B1-plants-10-00046" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. A large variety of crops worldwide can be infested, and the impact on yield losses has been estimated as a billion euros annually [
 <xref rid="B2-plants-10-00046" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In recent years, the management of root-knot nematode (RKN) populations in vegetable production was mainly based on the use of chemical nematicides. However, many of the most effective and well-known nematicides, such as methyl bromide and 1,3 dichloropropene, have been phased out due to their adverse effects on the environment. Farmers are obliged or enforced to use other means of management such as cultural practices, crop rotation, resistant cultivars, or rootstocks, while the use of synthetic chemical nematicides is declining. However, the persistence and efficacy of the nematicides still in use are reduced due to enhanced degradation [

 <xref rid="B4-plants-10-00046" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Researchers keep trying to find new molecules effective against plant parasitic nematodes [

 <xref rid="B9-plants-10-00046" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Isolated phytochemicals from different plant species have been used as pesticides themselves or have served as model compounds for synthetic agrochemicals by the industry [
 <xref rid="B10-plants-10-00046" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Plant-origin essential oils (EOs) and their components have been tested against plant parasitic nematodes [

 <xref rid="B12-plants-10-00046" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Volatile organic compounds produced by plants belonging to different botanical families are useful as defense substances against pests and pathogens. They are a complex mixture of mainly terpenoids and a variety of aromatic phenols, oxides, ethers, alcohols, esters, aldehydes, and ketones [
 <xref rid="B13-plants-10-00046" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Their chemical composition is not consistent among plant species and varieties, or different ratios of substances can be found due to the phenological stages of the plant. There are reports of EOs showing antimicrobial, antifungal [
 <xref rid="B14-plants-10-00046" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], antioxidant [
 <xref rid="B15-plants-10-00046" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and insecticidal activities [

 <xref rid="B20-plants-10-00046" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Specifically, many EOs and their components have been reported to have efficacy against pinewood (
 <italic>Bursaphelenchus xylophilus</italic>) and root-knot nematodes (
 <italic>Meloidogyne</italic> spp.) [

 <xref rid="B23-plants-10-00046" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] demonstrated the antibacterial activity of 
 <italic>Cuminum cyminum</italic> L. oil against genera responsible for plant or cultivated mushroom diseases. Although there are many studies using EOs, less attention has been paid to the use of hydrosols. Petrakis et al. [
 <xref rid="B24-plants-10-00046" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], working with hydrosols (HLs) isolated from three Lamiaceae plants, showed a significant change in 
 <italic>Myzus persicae</italic> behavior. Traka et al. [
 <xref rid="B25-plants-10-00046" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] reported that hydrosols derived from 
 <italic>Ocinum basilicum</italic> and 
 <italic>Ruta chalepensis</italic> were effective against 
 <italic>Aphis gossypii</italic> and 
 <italic>Tetranychus urticae</italic>.
