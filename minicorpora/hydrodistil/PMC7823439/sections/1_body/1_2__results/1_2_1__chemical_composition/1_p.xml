<p>All compounds of the EO and HL, identified according to their elution order from the TR-5MS capillary column, the relative retention indices (RRI), and the compounds’ relative percentages in the total composition, are shown in 
 <xref rid="plants-10-00046-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Twelve constituents were recorded in the EO, while nine constituents were identified from the HL. 
 <italic>γ</italic>-Terpinen-7-al (34.9%) and cumin aldehyde (26.5%) dominated in the EO, while α-terpinen-7-al (12.8%) and 
 <italic>γ</italic>-terpinene (11.1%) were present to a lesser extent. The HL was characterized by the presence of the same constituents in the same order, i.e., 
 <italic>γ</italic>-terpinen-7-al (42.0%), cumin aldehyde (31.5%) and α-terpinen-7-al (20.9%).
