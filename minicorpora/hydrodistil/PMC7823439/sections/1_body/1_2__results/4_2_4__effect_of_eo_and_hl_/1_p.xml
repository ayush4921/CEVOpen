<p>There was a significant decrease (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00046-f003">Figure 3</xref>) in the percentage of differentiated eggs (fully developed juvenile) between the control and all concentrations tested. Statistical analysis revealed no significant differences among the different concentrations of the EO for 
 <italic>M. javanica</italic>, apart from the concentration of 500 μL/L, which was significantly lower than the concentrations of 7.8, 15.6, and 31.2 μL/L. The lowest percentages of differentiated eggs were recorded at the concentrations of 250 and 500 μL/L. A significant reduction in egg differentiation was observed when undifferentiated eggs were treated with the lowest EO concentration (7.8 μL/L). When eggs were immersed in HL, a significant decrease in differentiated 
 <italic>M. javanica</italic> eggs was recorded upon increasing the HL dilution to 0.05 
 <italic>v/v</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00046-f004">Figure 4</xref>). A further reduction in egg differentiation was observed upon increasing the HL dilution to 0.2 and 0.5 
 <italic>v/v</italic>. The lowest percentage differentiation was observed in eggs of both species submerged in a 
 <italic>C. cyminum</italic> dilution of 0.5 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic> for 28 days.
