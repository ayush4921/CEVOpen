0: TFC was determined using the slightly modified analytical procedures of differential spectrometry provided by A. Meda et al.
1: for the estimation of the TFC in honey [ 42] and by N. Hudz et al.
2: for bee bread [ 33].
3: Rutin trihydrate was used to build the calibration curve in the concentration range of 20 to 100 mg/L.
4: Rutin trihydrate dissolution in 50% ethanol was carried out with the aid of ultrasound.
5: The results were expressed as rutin equivalents: mg eq-rutin/L of a tincture and mg eq-rutin/g of the  S. montana herb.
