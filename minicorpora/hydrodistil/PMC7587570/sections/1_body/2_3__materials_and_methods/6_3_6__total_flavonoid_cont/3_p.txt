0: The second way was used for the other tinctures.
1: Instead of plotting a calibration curve, a point of 50 L of a stock solution of rutin trihydrate (1000 mg/L) was used at least one time per day.
2: In this case TFC was calculated using the following formula: C = A test   m  1000   k/A rutin  V rutin, where C is TFC of the tested tincture (mg/L), A test is the absorbance of a reaction mixture of a tincture at the absorption maximum, A rutin is the absorbance of a reaction mixture of rutin solution in a concentration of 50 mg/L at the absorption maximum, m (mg) is mass of rutin trihydrate for the preparation of the stock solution (approximately 1000 mg/L), k is coefficient for the recalculation of rutin trihydrate into rutin (0.917), and V rutin is a volume in which rutin was dissolved.
