0: The TFC was calculated in two ways.
1: The first way was used for tinctures T1 and T2 with the simultaneous study of linearity of the analytical procedure.
2: Thereby, 10, 30, 50, 70, and 100 L of the stock solution of rutin trihydrate (1000 mg/L) were diluted with 50% ethanol up to 1.0 mL.
3: The obtained dilutions of rutin trihydrate were mixed with 1.0 mL of 2% aluminum chloride hexahydrate in 50% ethanol.
4: After incubation at room temperature for 75  10 min the spectra of the reaction mixtures were measured in the range of 360 nm to 460 nm with spectrophotometer (Photometry Hitachi U-2810).
5: The volume of 2% aluminum chloride hexahydrate in 50% ethanol was substituted by the same volume of 50% ethanol in the blank for each dilution of rutin trihydrate.
6: In a like manner, 50 L of the developed tinctures of  S. montana were diluted with 50% ethanol up to 1.0 mL and was mixed with 1.0 of 2% solution of aluminum chloride hexahydrate.
7: The mixture was mixed by vortex and incubation was done at room temperature for 75  10 min.
8: The volume of 2% solution of aluminum chloride was substituted by the same amount of 50% ethanol in blank.
9: The test was carried out for each tincture in triplicate.
10: For tinctures T1 and T2 the TFC was calculated using expression C = c  20  k, where C is TFC of the tested tincture, c is TPC taken from the calibration curve, 20 is coefficient of dilution of the tincture for testing, k is coefficient for the recalculation of rutin trihydrate into rutin (0.917).
