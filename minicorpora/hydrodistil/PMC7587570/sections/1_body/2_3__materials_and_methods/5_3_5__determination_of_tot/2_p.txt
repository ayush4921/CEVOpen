0: 100 L of dilution of a tincture (1:20 in 50% ethanol) were mixed with 100 L of FCR, 1500 L of purified water and 300 L of 20% solution of sodium carbonate.
1: The mixtures were mixed by vortex and incubation was done at room temperature at darkness for 2 h. Absorbance was measured at 760 mm with using spectrophotometer Photometry Hitachi U-2810.
2: Purified water was used as a blank.
3: The test was carried out for the two tinctures in triplicate.
4: The test was performed twice for tincture T2 for the repeatability study of the elaborated analytical procedure.
5: The results were expressed as gallic acid and rutin equivalents: mg eq-gallic acid and mg eq-rutin per 1 L of a tincture and per 1 g of the herbal substance.
6: The curves of gallic acid and rutin hydrate were plotted in the concentration range of 20 to 150 mg/L and 62 to 310 mg/L, respectively.
7: The stock solutions of gallic acid monohydrate (1100 mg/L) and rutin trihydrate (1200 mg/L) were prepared using purified water and 50% aqueous solution of ethanol, respectively.
8: The TPC was calculated using expression C = c  20  k, where C is TPC of the tested tincture, c is TPC taken from the calibration curve, 20 is coefficient of dilution of the tincture for testing, k is coefficient for the calculation of rutin trihydrate into rutin (0.919) and 1 for gallic acid.
9: The mean of three measurements was used for each concentration of the reference standard.
10: The kinetics of the reaction for the tinctures 1 and 2 was evaluated by comparing r (R 2) between the absorbance at 760 nm and the reaction time.
11: r  0.7 was established as the acceptance criterion [ 25].
