0: The TPC of the tinctures was determined by the FolinCiocalteu method using gallic acid and rutin as the reference standards according to the analytical procedure described in the publications [ 25, 41].
1: Gallic acid was chosen as it had been identified as a phenolic compound in  S. montana [ 1].
2: Rutin was chosen as commercially available reference standard.
3: Moreover, rutin [ 9, 30] and flavonoids with quercetin aglycon were identified in  S. montana [ 28].
