0: HPTLC analysis of phenolic compounds was carried out using the CAMAG analytical system (Muttenz, Switzerland) as described by N. Stanek and I. Jasicka-Misiak [ 16].
1: The reference standards of phenolic compounds were dissolved in methanol in a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL with the exception of rutin, quercetin, and ()-catechin.
2: For these three reference standards, the concentration was 0.1 mg/mL.
3: The tincture and standard solutions in a volume of 10 L were applied to chromatographic plates (20 cm  10 cm) using an automatic application device.
4: The mobile phase consisting of chloroform: ethyl acetate: formic acid (5:4:1,  v/ v/ v) was used for chromatography.
5: Visualization was performed in two ways: (1) under UV light (254 nm, 366 nm) and (2) under UV light (254 nm, 366 nm) after spraying with 1% methanolic AlCl 3 and drying for approximately 3 min in warm air.
6: The obtained chromatographic results were analyzed using HPTLC software (vision CATS, CAMAG, Muttenz, Switzerland).
