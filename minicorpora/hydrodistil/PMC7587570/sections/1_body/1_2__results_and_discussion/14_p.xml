<p>The influence of extraction mode could be explained by the following factors. More effective remaceration in time is not effective in extraction as maceration for 1 day yields a significantly small amount of extracted flavonoids (

 <xref rid="molecules-25-04763-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>, the more days of extraction, the higher is the TFC. Using maceration, 5â€“14 days of extraction is a general time of tinctures manufacture [
