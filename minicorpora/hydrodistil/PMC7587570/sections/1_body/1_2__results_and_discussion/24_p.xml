 <italic>S. montana</italic> collected in Albania (Valbonë location) and Montenegro (Ulcinj location). Thymol (31.1%), carvacrol (16.2%) and 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (13.7%) were found in the essential oil of 
 <italic>S. montana</italic> collected in Valbonë. Thymol (14.97%), carvacrol (17.92%) and

 <italic>S. montana</italic> collected in Ulcinj. Hajdari et al. [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-25-04763" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] consider that plants from Valbonë and Ulcinj belong to the monoterpene aromatic polyphenol chemotype (
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene, thymol and carvacrol chemotype). Aerial parts of 
 <italic>S. montana</italic> were collected from July to September 2013 in the locations from naturally growing populations in Albania and Montenegro [
