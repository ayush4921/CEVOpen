<p>The HPTLC fingerprints of this tincture had two prominent bands at R
 <sub>f</sub> = 0.34 (light blue) and R
 <sub>f</sub> = 0.52 (blue) under 254 nm and 366 nm before and after derivatisation that corresponded to rosmarinic and caffeic acids, respectively. The complex identification by means of colour reactions at 254 and 366 nm irradiation before and after derivatisation did not allow to unambiguously differ luteolin from quercetin in the tincture due to low separation. As illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04763-f005">Figure 5</xref>, very similar Rf are observed for luteolin (R
 <sub>f</sub> = 0.54) and quercetin (R
 <sub>f</sub> = 0.56). Under 254 nm irradiation before and after derivatisation, respectively, there is a black band of low intensity and deep yellow band of low intensity (R
 <sub>f</sub> ~ 0.55) that could meet Rf of the reference standard of luteolin and quercetin. Moreover, the chromatograms exhibit the two notable bands of intensive blue and intensive black colours at R
 <sub>f</sub> = 0.27 − 0.28 and 0.25, respectively, under 254 nm and 366 nm irradiation. One of them (R
 <sub>f</sub> = 0.25) could be ascribed to (–)-catechin. The band of the reference standard of (–)-catechin has the lowest intensity among all the three phenolic compounds taken in a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL. Additionally, in case of rutin (R
 <sub>f</sub> = 0.03) and chlorogenic acid (R
 <sub>f</sub> = 0.09), it seems that they are present in the tincture in a small amount. Furthermore, in case of apigenin (R
 <sub>f</sub> = 0.58), it is supposed that it is not present in a detectable concentration in this tincture.
