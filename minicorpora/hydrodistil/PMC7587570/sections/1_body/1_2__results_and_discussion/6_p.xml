<p>Such regularity was established in the performed studies: the longer was the reaction time, the less was the R
 <sup>2</sup> between the absorbance and time of the reaction of FCR with the tinctures of 
 <italic>S. montana.</italic> In addition, 62 and 92 min can be chosen as the period for checking robustness of the analytical procedure of the TPC determination in the 
 <italic>S. montana</italic> tinctures. Therefore, on the basis of experimental studies, it was set up and justified that 65 min is the time of the almost complete interaction of 
 <italic>S. montana</italic> polyphenols with the FCR and reaction time more than 65 min has no influence on the TPC determination. The TPC is provided in
