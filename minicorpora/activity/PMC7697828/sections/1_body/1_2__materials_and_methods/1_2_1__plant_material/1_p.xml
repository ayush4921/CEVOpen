<p>The experiment was carried out at the experimental field of the Department of Vegetable and Medicinal Plants, Warsaw University of Life Sciences (WULS-SGGW) (5210180 N; 2105234 E), on heavy alluvial soil. Seeds of Greek oregano and common oregano originated from Polish Gene Bank collection (accession numbers: 406735 and 401291, respectively). Seeds were sown in the first week of February (2020) into multi-pots filled with a peat substrate, in a greenhouse. A total of 180 seedlings of each subspecies were randomly selected and planted out into the field in the last week of April. The randomized block design (60 seedlings per plot; in 3 replications) was applied, with a spacing of 40 × 60 cm. The harvest of the herb (upper, not woody parts of shoots) was performed on 1-year old plants, at three stages of plant’s development: at the beginning of blooming (fourth week of June), at the full blooming (third week of July) and at the beginning of seed-setting (second week of August). The herb was cut at a height of about 15 cm above ground. The fresh and dry weight of the herb was determined (g per plant). After drying at 35 °C, the herb was ground and prepared for chemical analysis. Climatic parameters were recorded (
