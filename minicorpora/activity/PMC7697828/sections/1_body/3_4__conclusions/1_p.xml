<p>Results obtained in the present work indicate on quite good adaptation of Greek oregano to climatic conditions of Central Europe. This subspecies, grown in the temperate zone, is able to create satisfied yield and still keeps its typical characters of the Mediterranean plant. Among them, a high amount of essential oil followed by a high percentage share of carvacrol seem to be the most important from the practice point of view. Common oregano also presented interesting features, especially when its chemotype (sabinyl/cymyl type rich in sesquiterpenes) and sensory value (floral, sweet) are concerned. Herb of both subspecies appeared to be a rich source of rosmarinic acid, a compound known for its extremely high antioxidant properties. It was shown that the content of this substance fluctuated during plantâ€™s development: increased from the beginning of blooming to the beginning of seed-setting, both in Greek oregano and common oregano. With regards to the obtained results, it seems that Greek oregano can be successfully cultivated in the temperate climate of Central Europe. The production of this herb on site, which usually results in its lower price, may increase its availability and utilization, not only as a spice but also as natural medicine.</p>
