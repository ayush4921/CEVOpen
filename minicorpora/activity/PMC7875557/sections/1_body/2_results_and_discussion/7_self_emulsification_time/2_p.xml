<p>The rate of emulsification is the prime determinant factor to estimate the efficiency of SNEDDS (Pouton, 
 <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). The recorded self-emulsification times for the drug loaded (SN and DN) formulation are presented in 
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. From the data obtained, it was shown that all the tested formulation of SN-DN SNEDDS were self-emulsified within 7.45 to 23.50â€‰s. This short period of self-emulsification as recorded in all the investigated formulation systems showed their potentiality for easy and rapid self-emulsification. The data from the self-emulsification assessment test also suggested that the rapid emulsification occurs only when the surface tension is reduced during the formulation dispersion and depends mainly upon the nature of the oil/surfactant and their proportion.
