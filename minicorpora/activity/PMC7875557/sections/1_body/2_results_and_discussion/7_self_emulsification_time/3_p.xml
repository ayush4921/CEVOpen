<p>From the overall self-emulsification time, it was suggested that if the concentration of water-soluble excipients increased in the formulation, the spontaneity of emulsification process improved but self-emulsification time might decrease. In addition, the use of cremophor EL facilitated in reducing the interfacial tension and thus causing significant interfacial disruption and discharge of droplets into the bulk aqueous phase. These results were in agreement with the work done by Ali Nasr et al. in 2016, where SNEDDS were developed for Olmesartan medoxomil using surfactant cremophor RH40 and found that all representative SNEDDS formulations showed far less emulsification time in the range of 14 to 23 s (Nasr et al.,
