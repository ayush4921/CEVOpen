<p>Developed SNEDDS formulations were assessed for the physical appearance after dilution in aqueous media (water). The physical appearance of the SNEDDS suggests that the dispersion can be formed upon aqueous dilution in the gastro intestinal tract and thereby produce nanodroplets (Kazi et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Initially dispersion was assessed visually after adding 1 g formulation to 100 mL water. Typically, the formulations produced transparent appearances spontaneously when diluted (

 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The efficiency of the formulation was visually evaluated using the following grading system (Nasr et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>): Grade A: Spontaneously forming emulsion having a clear or bluish appearance (within 30 s, F1, F3, F4). Grade B: Spontaneously forming but slightly less clear emulsion, having a fine white appearance (F2). The results from the efficiency assessment showed that all the grade A SNEDDS were found to be promising in terms of the assessment criteria and were used for further developmental process (
