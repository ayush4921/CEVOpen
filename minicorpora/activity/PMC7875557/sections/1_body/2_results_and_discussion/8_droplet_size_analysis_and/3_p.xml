<p>SNEDDS contain several components which may affect the droplet size in GI fluids upon dispersion. Therefore, the droplet size analysis was essential and could mimic the dilution behavior 
 <italic>inÂ vivo.</italic> The results from the droplet size analysis suggested that more the water-soluble materials in the formulation, lower the droplet size substantially upon aqueous dispersion. Hence, the droplet sizes of F1 and F3 were less than F2 and F4 due to high contents of water-soluble excipients in the formulations. In addition, the SNEDDS were widely monodispersed in the aqueous media with lower polydispersity values of less than 0.2.
