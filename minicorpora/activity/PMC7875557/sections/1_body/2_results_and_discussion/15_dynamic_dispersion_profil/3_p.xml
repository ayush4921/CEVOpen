 <italic>In vitro</italic> dispersion tests appropriately predicted whether precipitation is likely to occur prior to absorption. In the current assessment, the SN and DN loaded SNEDDS were tested in the Fasted (FaSSIF) and Fed State Simulated Intestinal Fluid (FeSSIF) and the drug concentration was monitored until 24 h time. The results showed that the F1-SNEDDS containing 80% SN and DN (8.91 mg and 44.06 mg) maintained more than 99% drug in solution within 4 h (
