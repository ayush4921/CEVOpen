<p>The release performance of the SNEDDS formulation and absence of drug precipitation upon dispersion is the desired goal for pharmaceutical applications. Dynamic dispersion tests for the developed SNEDDS 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> was used to examine the ability of SNEDDS vehicle when dispersed into intestinal media and therefore helped us to follow the roles in development and selection of appropriate SNEDDS formulations for further 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies for the combined dose. The extensively improved solubilization capacity of the SNEDDS formulation over the desired drug concentration could help avoid 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> drug precipitation.
