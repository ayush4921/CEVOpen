<p>Physical stability was carried out to determine the maximum storage duration which can lead to the separation of emulsion (cracking) phases (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3</xref>). The test results showed no significant droplet size changes and zeta potential values, which suggested good physical stability in both anhydrous and dispersed forms.
