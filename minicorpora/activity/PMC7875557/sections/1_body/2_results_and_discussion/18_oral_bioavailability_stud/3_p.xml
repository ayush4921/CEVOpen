<p>The AUC of DN was also significantly increased in the SNEDDS treated group as compared to only marketed product treated group from 6.46 ± 0.17 to 17.94 ± 1.25 (µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>). The 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> study exhibited a twofold increase in the oral bioavailability of DN from our F1-SNEDDS compared with the marketed product (tablet). These results suggest the potential use of the proposed SNEDDS for improving oral bioavailability of anti-diabetic drug DN, which could be a great choice for combined dose with SN to improve the treatment of Type 2 diabetes.
