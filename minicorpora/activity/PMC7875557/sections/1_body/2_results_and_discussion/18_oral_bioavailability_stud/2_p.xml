<p>The 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> pharmacokinetic behavior of the representative F1-SNEDDS formulation was studied to quantify DN at the present investigation in rat plasma after oral administration. DN is reported in this study to be well absorbed after oral administration, with peak plasma levels attained within 4 h. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0009">Figure 9</xref> showed that the 
 <italic>C</italic>
 <sub>max</sub> of the DN from the oral administration of marketed product was found to be 1.04 ± 0.02 µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>, whereas the

 <sub>max</sub> of DN from the oral administration of our developed F1-SNEDDS formulation was 1.99 ± 0.21 µg mL
