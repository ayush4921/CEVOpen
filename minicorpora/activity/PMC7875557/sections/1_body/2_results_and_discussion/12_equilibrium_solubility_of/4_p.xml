<p>Amongst all the anhydrous formulations, F1-SNEDDS, BSO: CMCM (3:7) with CrEL at ratio [50:50% w/w] exhibited the highest SN and DN solubility at 11.14 mg/g and 55.07 mg/g (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), respectively with transparent appearance upon aqueous dilution. Formulations (F2), which contained the same oil components as F1 but opposite mixing ratios [7:3] with 50% surfactant cremophor EL, respectively showed the comparably lower solubility of SN and DN (5.83 mg and 44.38 mg) in anhydrous formulations. These formulations were also found to be transparent and bluish in appearance. On the other hand, the SNEDDS containing long chain lipids such as SBO and maisene 35-1 at ratio 3:7 and 7:3 with 50% cremophor EL as surfactant have lower equilibrium solubility. The solubility studies suggest that both SN and DN are highly soluble in the presence of polar lipids (high percent of mono-glycerides) in the formulations.
