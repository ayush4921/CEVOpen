<p>The therapeutic efficiency of DN is particularly limited by its poor water solubility and low bioavailability after oral delivery. In this study, all four SNEDDS were studied to improve the solubility of SN and DN in combined dosage form. During the initial screening process, a suitable SNEDDS formulation of SN and DN, was selected in terms of the following important considerations: (1) compatibility of the excipients within the formulation compositions, (2) good solubility of SN and DN, and (3) the efficient droplet size and stability after forming nanoemulsion (Zhang etÂ al.,
