<p>The excipients used to design SNEDDS in this research and the fraction used to blend together to yield various formulation systems are shown in (
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Four formulations were developed using various concentrations of oil blends with one specific water soluble surfactant. Two long chain triglycerides oils such as BSO and SBO was blended with capmul medium chain mono-glycerides and maisene long chain mono-glycerides, respectively. The first two formulations (F1 and F2) contained 15% and 35% BSO and 35% and 15% capmul MCM with 50% nonionic surfactant cremophorEL. On the other hand, formulation F3 and F4 contained SBO 15% and 35% and maisene 35-1 35% and 15% with 50% cremophor EL. Nonionic surfactant cremophor EL used was constantly at 50% in all four formulations. The formulations were categorized in two different kinds as medium chain SNEDDS (F1 and F2) and long chain SNEDDS (F3 and F4) in the current set. The appearance of the anhydrous formulations and their dispersion upon aqueous dilution are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2</xref>. The anhydrous formulation of F1 and F2 produced yellowish colored texture due to the BSO. The aqueous dispersion of F1, F3, and F4 were shown transparent and or bluish appearance whereas F2 produced whitish appearance.
