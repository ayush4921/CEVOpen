<p>TEM images of SN and DN loaded SNEDDS formulation subsequent to post dilution with deionized water are shown in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4(B)</xref>) suggest that SN-DN loaded F1-SNEDDS showed spherical and homogeneous droplets and were in the nanometer size range (50–100 nm), which was also evident by the particle size distribution data obtained using Malvern Zetasizer (
 <xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The uniformed droplet size of the monodispersed self-nanoemulsifying formulation in the current study was well-correlated by the images obtained from TEM analysis.
