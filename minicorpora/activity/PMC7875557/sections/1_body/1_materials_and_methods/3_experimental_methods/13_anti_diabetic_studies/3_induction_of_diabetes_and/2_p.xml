<p>Diabetes was induced overnight in fasted mice by single intraperitoneal (IP) injection of 60 mg/kg of streptozotocin (STZ) that was freshly dissolved in in 0.1 M cold citrate buffer at pH 4.5. After 72 h of STZ administration, blood was collected from the animals and plasma glucose levels were examined. Animals that were confirmed diabetic by the elevated plasma glucose levels (&gt;200 mg/dl) were used for the experiment. The animals were then randomly assigned into seven groups of three animals and received the following treatments: Group I: Normal control mice treated with Normal saline; Group II: Diabetic control mice treated with Normal saline; Group III: Diabetic mice treated with thymoquinone 5 mg/kg (IP); Group IV: Diabetic mice treated with DN 6 mg/kg (IP); Group V: Diabetic mice treated with SN 10 mg/kg (IP); Group VI: Diabetic mice treated with DN 6 mg/kg (IP) and SN 10 mg/kg (IP); Group VII: Diabetic mice treated with marketed product Dapazin
 <sup>®</sup> 6 mg/kg (IP).
