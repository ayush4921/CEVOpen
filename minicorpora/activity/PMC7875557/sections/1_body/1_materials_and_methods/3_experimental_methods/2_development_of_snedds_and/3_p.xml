<p>The compositions of SNEDDS were prepared using different natural/semi synthetic long chain lipid oils, and hydrophilic surfactants which have good solubilizing capacity for the model drugs. All four SNEDDS formulations were studied using just four lipid components and one surfactant only; BSO, SBO, Maisene 35-1 (M35-1), Capmul MCM (CMCM, C
 <sub>10</sub>), and Cremophor EL (CrEL), respectively.
