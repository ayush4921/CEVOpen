<p>Chromatographic separation of the DN from the plasma sample was simply performed on a Dionex
 <sup>®</sup> UHPLC systems (Ultimate 3000, Thermo scientific, Bedford, MA, USA) with a photodiode array detector. The mobile phase was an isocratic mixer of methanol with (0.1% formic acid and 0.2% PhA) aqueous solution (28:72) % and ACN in a ratio of 82/18 v/v with flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. The total run time was 6 min with the sample injection volume of 2.0 µL for the analysis. This method for plasma analysis was validated based on the International Conference on Harmonization guidelines (Q2A I (R1),
