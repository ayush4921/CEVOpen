<p>The pharmacokinetic assessment was done after oral administration on the basis of DN concentrations in the plasma samples of the rat. Extraction of the model drug, DN from the rat plasma was done by Liquid-Liquid Extraction procedure. Plasma samples collected were transferred into 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes. A 1 μg/mL concentration of internal standard solution was constantly added to all the plasma samples along with methanol. The mixture was vortexed for 8–10 min and then centrifuged for 10 min at 4725 rpm. The clear supernatant containing the organic layer was transferred into clean centrifuge tube and dried under nitrogen gas at 45–50 °C. Dry residues obtained here were then reconstituted carefully in 225 μL of mobile phase. This was vortexed and transferred to an auto sampler vial to be analyzed in the UHPLC system.</p>
