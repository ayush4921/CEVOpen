<p>Male rats (Wister, 200–220 g) were obtained from Laboratory Animal Center of pharmacy college, KSU. The rats were randomly allocated into two groups, each group consisted of six rats: the representative SNEDDS [F1, BSO/CMCM/CrEL (15/35/50%w/w)] (group A) and marketed drug (group B). The animals were fasted for 12 h prior to the oral administration of SNEDDS of DN (6 mg/kg rat). The experimental procedures were carried out in accordance with the principles of National Institute of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH Publications No. 80–23; 1996) as well as the animal facilities guidelines from the Ethical committee of Experimental Animal Care Center, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University (Clearance No. KSU-SE—19-105; 20th November 2019).
