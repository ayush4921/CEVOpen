<p>The lipolysis experiments were conducted by using 250 mg of F1 and F3 SNEDDS (SN and DN concentrations: 80% of the equilibrium solubility). The formulation was dispersed into 9 mL of simulated intestinal aqueous media under fed conditions [19, 21]. Phospholipids and bile salt were included in the lipolysis buffer at a molar ratio of 4:1, which is the actual ratio secreted in bile (20 and 5 mM). Prior to enzyme addition, emulsification of the representative SNEDDS was done for 5 min to form mixed micellar solutions in a thermostatic jacketed glass reaction vessel. The lipolysis reaction was started with the addition of 1 mL pancreatin solution (800 tributyrin units of pancreatic lipase) to reaction vessel. Lipolysis experiment was conducted at a constant pH of 6.8, using a pH-stat titration unit (Metrohm
 <sup>®</sup>, Switzerland) and continued for 30 min at 37 °C. Samples were periodically withdrawn at 0, 5, 10, 20, and 30 min during the titration reaction to examine the drug solubility in digests. A 0.5 M solution of 4-bromophenol boronic acid in methanol was used to stop further lipolysis of the withdrawn samples. Drug content from the aqueous phase were directly analyzed by UHPLC using suitable dilution with ACN.
