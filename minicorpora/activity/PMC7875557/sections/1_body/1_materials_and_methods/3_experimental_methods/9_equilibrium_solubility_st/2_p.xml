<p>The equilibrium solubility of the two model drugs, SN and DN, was determined in the SNEDDS formulations using the simple shake flask method (Mohsin etÂ al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The samples were prepared by adding an excess amount of SN and DN to the formulations, which was then thoroughly agitated with a vortex mixer to ensure adequate mixing. Three replicates were taken for each formulation. The samples for the solubility experiments were analyzed using in-house developed UHPLC method by dissolving each of the formulations with an appropriate solvent.
