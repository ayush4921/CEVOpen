<p>The zeta potential was determined by measuring the diluted representative formulation using laser diffraction analysis by Zetasizer (Nano ZS, Germany) particle sizing systems. The formulations were diluted at a ratio of 1:1000 v/v (SNEDDS: milliQ water) as mentioned in droplet size analysis and mixed for 1 min before analysis. Emulsion droplet’s charges and their zeta potential values were recorded.</p>
