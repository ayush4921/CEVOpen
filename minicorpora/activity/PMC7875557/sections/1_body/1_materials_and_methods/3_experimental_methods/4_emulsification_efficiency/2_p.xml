<p>The self-emulsification efficiency of SNEDDS was evaluated upon aqueous dilution with water. An amount of 100 mg of each formulation was added to 100 mL of milliQ water maintained at room temperature (22 °C). The diluted samples were given a gentle agitation by a standard stainless-steel spatula. ‘Spontaneity’ and ‘appearance’ were considered as assessment tools for visual observation of the prepared nanoemulsions. To predict the performance of the formulation 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, the following grading systems were used for evaluation: Grade A: Emulsion formation in less than 1 min with transparent appearance, Grade B: Emulsion formation in less than 1 min with bluish appearance and Grade C: Emulsion formation in less than 1 min with fine whitish appearance. The ratio of dilution 1:1000 was maintained for all the formulations.
