<p>The use of combinational therapy often results in reduction in blood glucose levels compared to those of any single drugs available or oral monotherapy (Yki-Jarvinen, 
 <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). A wide range of combinations such as thiazolidinedione, or acarbose; sulfonylurea plus metformin, metformin plus a thiazolidinedione or acarbose have been used effectively to achieve glycemic control in patients for whom oral monotherapy had failed and therefore demand for combination therapy (Charpentier, 
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Charbonnel et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Aquilante et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). In addition, increasing line of evidence suggests that patients who are not taking insulin, combination therapy involving oral anti-diabetic agents characterized with different mechanisms of actions may be effective in controlling blood glucose levels (Nichols et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Low-dose combinational therapy is believed to have the potential to reduce the occurrence of side effects associated with higher doses of single agents and may also achieve superior glycemic control (Vahatalo et al.,
