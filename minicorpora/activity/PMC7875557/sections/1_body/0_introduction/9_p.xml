<p>This technique of SD-DN SNEDDS development can be highly efficient as it could improve solubility and produce stable nanodroplets without causing any precipitation upon aqueous dilution with the GIT fluids before absorption. Therefore, the aim of the current research was to prepare an effective combined oral dosage form of SN and DN (encapsulated in liquid SNEDDS) with improved anti-diabetic effects to meet the current need as improved treatment of type 2 diabetes.</p>
