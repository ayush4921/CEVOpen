0: The physicochemical characteristics of SN and DN suggest that they are suitable for self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery system (SNEDDS) as such system is reported to improve drug solubility, permeability, and bioavailability after oral administration (Kazi et al.,  2017; Pandey et al.,  2020).
1: Liquid SNEDDS can be easily filled into soft/hard gelatin capsules and converted into solid dosage form in a single step process via spray drying, adsorption techniques.
2: Both liquid and solid SNEDDS have been shown to enhance the drug release significantly and maintain the drug in solubilized form during the GI transit time (Khursheed et al.,  2020).
3: In a recent study, the biochemical, hematological and histopathological investigations in diabetic rats showed the potential application of SNEDDS when loaded with Polypeptide K as anti-diabetic drug (Garg et al.,  2017).
4: SNEDDS in the current studies were developed using black seed oil (BSO) which contained therapeutically active compound thymoquinone.
5: (a phytochemical shows anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects).
6: Thymoquinone is reported to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects and thus could show the synergistic effects along with the SN-DN combined dose.
