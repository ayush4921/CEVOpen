<p>Dapagliflozin (DN; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1(B)</xref>) is a sodium glucose co-transporters (SGLTs inhibitor) which acts in transporting glucose, vitamins, amino acids, osmolytes, and ions across tissue membranes and SGLT1 and SGLT2 mediate glucose reabsorption (Plosker, 
 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Del Prato et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). While SGLT1 is the main glucose transporter in the small intestine, SGLT2 is predominantly expressed on epithelial cells surface on the lining of the S1 segment of the proximal convoluted tubule (Fioretto &amp; Avogaro, 
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Studies have shown DN to be the most selective for SGLT2 (1200-fold over SGLT1), which could be the better drug for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (Santos et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Wilding et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).
