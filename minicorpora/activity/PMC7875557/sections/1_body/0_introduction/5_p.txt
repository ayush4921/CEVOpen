0: Sitagliptin (SN), an orally active, potent dipeptidyl-peptidase inhibitor [DPP-4 inhibitor ( Figure 1(A)) has recently been approved (listed in top 20 drugs in 2017) for the therapy of type 2 diabetes (Zerilli & Pyon,  2007).
1: Like other DPP-4 inhibitors, its mechanism of action is by increasing glucagon-like peptide-1 incretin hormones and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (Miller et al.,  2009).
2: SN is effective in lowering HbA1c, and glucose (during fasting as well as postprandial) in monotherapy and in combination with other oral anti-diabetic agents (Plosker,  2014; Dey,  2017).
3: It stimulates insulin secretion when hyperglycemia is present and inhibits glucagon secretion (Scheen & Van Gaal,  2013).
