<p>The physicochemical characteristics of SN and DN suggest that they are suitable for self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery system (SNEDDS) as such system is reported to improve drug solubility, permeability, and bioavailability after oral administration (Kazi et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Pandey et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Liquid SNEDDS can be easily filled into soft/hard gelatin capsules and converted into solid dosage form in a single step process via spray drying, adsorption techniques. Both liquid and solid SNEDDS have been shown to enhance the drug release significantly and maintain the drug in solubilized form during the GI transit time (Khursheed et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). In a recent study, the biochemical, hematological and histopathological investigations in diabetic rats showed the potential application of SNEDDS when loaded with Polypeptide K as anti-diabetic drug (Garg et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). SNEDDS in the current studies were developed using black seed oil (BSO) which contained therapeutically active compound thymoquinone. (a phytochemical shows anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects). Thymoquinone is reported to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects and thus could show the synergistic effects along with the SN-DN combined dose.
