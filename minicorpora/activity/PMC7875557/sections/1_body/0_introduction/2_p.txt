0: Type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease that is characterized with increasing blood glucose levels over time.
1: The disease is a major cause of blindness, heart attacks, stroke, kidney failure, and lower limb amputation in patients (Al Dawish et al.,  2016).
2: Most of the type 2 diabetic patients require multiple therapies in order to control their blood sugar levels effectively and maintain glycemia at or below the A1c target of less than 7% (Al-Faris et al.,  2006).
3: Although there have been several studies performed to evaluate the effectiveness of combined oral therapy to improve glycemic control, there is no large-scale definitive study on which of these are the best successive combinations to use.
4: Therefore, emphasis should be given to the new combination therapies of anti-diabetic drugs, which must keep the A1c from rising much above the target range (Charpentier,  2002).
