<p>The antinociceptive effect of AE and EO was assessed using the formalin test [
 <xref rid="B38-plants-10-00116" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. All the samples were diluted in the vehicle and animals were divided into groups (
 <italic>n</italic> = 6). Mice were treated with AE (31.6–316 mg/kg, p.o.), EO (30–170 µg/paw, i.pl.), diclofenac (positive control, 50 mg/kg, p.o. and 100 µg/paw, i.pl.) or with vehicle (0.5% Tween 80 in 0.9% saline solution). After 30 min, each animal was received 30 µL of diluted 2% formalin in into the mice dorsal surface of the right hind paw. The biphasic response (licking of the injected paw) induced by the formalin solution was quantified every 5 min during a 30 min period [
