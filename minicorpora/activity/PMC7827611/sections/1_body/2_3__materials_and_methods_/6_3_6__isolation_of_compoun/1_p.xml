<p>The ethyl acetate fraction (9.5 g) was subjected to column chromatography on Sephadex LH-20, eluting with methanol; 28 (16 mL each) fractions were obtained (F
 <sub>1</sub>–F
 <sub>28</sub>). Secondary fraction F
 <sub>20</sub> was dissolved in MeOH; from this solution precipitated 85 mg of apigenin (
 <bold>6</bold>). Column chromatography on Sephadex LH-20 of F
 <sub>16</sub> (1.20 g), eluting with acetone−MeOH (9:1), rendered 24 fractions (8 mL each): F
 <sub>16-1</sub>–F
 <sub>16-24</sub>. Fractions F
 <sub>16-5</sub>, F
 <sub>16-10</sub>, and F
 <sub>16-13</sub> yielded 14 mg of 
 <bold>3</bold>, 8 mg of 
 <bold>5</bold> and 5 mg of 
 <bold>4</bold>, respectively. Fraction F
 <sub>17</sub> (50 mg) was subjected to column chromatography on silica gel (50 g), eluting with a gradient of hexane−EtOAc (9:1→0:10) and EtOAc−MeOH (10:0→0:10), 12 fractions of 300 mL each were obtained. From F
 <sub>17-5</sub>, eluted with hexane−EtOAc (7:3), 9 mg of 
 <bold>7</bold> were obtained. From F
 <sub>17-6</sub>, eluted with hexane−EtOAc (6:4), crystalized 8 mg of 
 <bold>8</bold>. Compounds 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> were identified by comparison with authentic standards (TLC, HPLC, NMR).
