0: Infusions and poultices prepared from the aerial parts of   Baccharis heterophylla Kunth (Asteraceae) are widely used in Oaxaca (Mexico) for relieving painful and inflammatory complaints.
1: Therefore, the antinociceptive potential of an aqueous extract (31.6316 mg/kg, p.o.)
2: and essential oil (30177 g/paw, i.pl.)
3: of the plant was assessed using the formalin test.
4: Both preparations inhibited the formalin-induced nociception response (100316 mg/kg and 100177 g/paw, respectively) during the tests second phase.
5: Chemical analysis of the aqueous extract revealed that the major active components were chlorogenic acid (  1), 3,4-di-  O-(  E)-caffeoylquinic acid (  2), 3,5-di-  O-(  E)-caffeoylquinic acid (  3), 4,5-di-  O-(  E)-caffeoylquinic acid (  4), 3,5-di-  O-(  E)-caffeoylquinic acid methyl ester (  5), apigenin (  6), genkwanin (  7), acacetin (  8).
6: Compounds   1  5 and   8 are new for   B. heterophylla.
7: A high-pressure liquid chromatographic method for quantifying chlorogenic acid (  1) and di-caffeoylquinic acids   2  4 in the plant was developed and validated.
8: Analyses of the essential oil and the headspace solid-phase microextraction products, via gas-chromatography-mass spectrometry, revealed that the major volatiles were -pinene, myrcene, D-limonene, -caryophyllene, and -caryophyllene, which have demonstrated antinociceptive properties.
