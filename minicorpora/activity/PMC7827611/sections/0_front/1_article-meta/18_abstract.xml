 <p>Infusions and poultices prepared from the aerial parts of 
  <italic>Baccharis heterophylla</italic> Kunth (Asteraceae) are widely used in Oaxaca (Mexico) for relieving painful and inflammatory complaints. Therefore, the antinociceptive potential of an aqueous extract (31.6–316 mg/kg, p.o.) and essential oil (30–177 µg/paw, i.pl.) of the plant was assessed using the formalin test. Both preparations inhibited the formalin-induced nociception response (100–316 mg/kg and 100–177 µg/paw, respectively) during the test’s second phase. Chemical analysis of the aqueous extract revealed that the major active components were chlorogenic acid (
  <bold>1</bold>), 3,4-di-
  <italic>O</italic>-(
  <italic>E</italic>)-caffeoylquinic acid (
  <bold>2</bold>), 3,5-di-
  <italic>O</italic>-(
  <italic>E</italic>)-caffeoylquinic acid (
  <bold>3</bold>), 4,5-di-
  <italic>O</italic>-(
  <italic>E</italic>)-caffeoylquinic acid (
  <bold>4</bold>), 3,5-di-
  <italic>O</italic>-(
  <italic>E</italic>)-caffeoylquinic acid methyl ester (
  <bold>5</bold>), apigenin (
  <bold>6</bold>), genkwanin (
  <bold>7</bold>), acacetin (
  <bold>8</bold>). Compounds 
  <bold>1</bold>–
  <bold>5</bold> and 
  <bold>8</bold> are new for 
  <italic>B. heterophylla</italic>. A high-pressure liquid chromatographic method for quantifying chlorogenic acid (
  <bold>1</bold>) and di-caffeoylquinic acids 
  <bold>2</bold>–
  <bold>4</bold> in the plant was developed and validated. Analyses of the essential oil and the headspace solid-phase microextraction products, via gas-chromatography-mass spectrometry, revealed that the major volatiles were β-pinene, myrcene, D-limonene, β-caryophyllene, and α-caryophyllene, which have demonstrated antinociceptive properties.
