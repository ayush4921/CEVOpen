0: As an alternative to natural and chemically synthesized direct-acting bactericides, there has been an increase in the use of approaches that aim to suppress a microorganisms ability to parasitize and damage biological substrates by altering its physiology.
1: More specifically, this approach involves the search and creation of quorum-sensing (QS) inhibitors in bacteria.
2: QS inhibitors are considered an attractive alternative to traditional infection treatments, especially for infections caused by multiresistant strains of microorganisms [ 1].
3: In bacteria, QS is understood to be a density-dependent means of communication, mediated by small diffusing molecules (autoinducers) and, on reaching a threshold population density, leading to functional and morphological differentiation of its constituent cells [ 2].
4: At the same time, discovery of this phenomenon of the collective behavior of bacteria has enabled a fundamental reevaluation of many examples of the functional and morphological differentiation of prokaryotes, including the formation of virulence factors and biofilm, conjugation, and sporogenesis [ 3].
