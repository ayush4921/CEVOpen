<p>Ahlem 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] studied the effect of plant extracts from three different medicinal plants (
 <italic>Aristolochia ringens</italic>, 
 <italic>Allium sativum</italic>, and 
 <italic>Ocimum gratissimum</italic>), but noted that they did not lead to significant changes in many indicators, such as TP, erythrocytes, ALT, and AST. We noted similar results in our study when using gamma-octalactone isolated from 
 <italic>E. viminalis</italic> extract. The addition of thyme, mint, and eucalyptus to the diet of broiler chickens contributes to a significant increase in live weight; however, it also decreases the serum concentration of liver enzymes (e.g., ALT, AST, and ALP). In our study, at a dosage of 0.2 ml/kg live weight/day, we only noted non-significant decreases in AST, but did see a significant increase in live weight. Khalaji [
 <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] noted that 
 <italic>E. globulus</italic> extract lowers blood GLU level in diabetic animals and exhibits antioxidant activity, as demonstrated by an increase in catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase activity, and a decrease of lipid peroxidation levels in the liver and kidneys. In the current research, antioxidant activity was manifested by a significant increase in superoxide dismutase in all experimental groups and catalase in Groups I and II. Mustafa [
 <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] evaluated the effect of 
 <italic>Camellia</italic> L. plant extract in broiler chickens’ diets, noting a significant decrease in the total number of leukocytes, cholesterol concentration, and productivity as a result of the extract. Similar to the results of our study, Mashayekhi 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] noted that 
 <italic>Eucalyptus camaldulensis</italic> leaf extract increases body weight of broiler chickens, as well as the secretion of digestive enzymes, such as lipase and amylase. Damjanović-Vratnica 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] found an antimicrobial effect of eucalyptus oil, especially against 
 <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic>, and 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>; the authors suggest that this antimicrobial effect is due to the presence of monoterpenes and oxygenated monoterpenes, which are the main group of bactericidal molecules present in eucalyptus. Rehman 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], after the introduction of eucalyptus oil to broilers’ drinking water, observed increases in body weight and feed conversion; however, Barbour 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] noted an opposite result.
