<p>The analysis accounted for incubation time in the column and revealed a relative content, estimated according to peak area in the chromatogram, probability of identification (not &lt;85%), and physicochemical characteristics that suggested the presence of biological properties in substances. Libraries of compounds with putative QS inhibiting properties were identified: 2.4-dihydroxy-2.5-dimethylfuran-3-one; 1-Methyl-4-(1-methylethyl) benzene; 3-Hydroxy-2-methyl-4H-pyran-4-one; 3,4-dihydroxyoxolan-2-one; 2-ethyl-5-methyl-1.3.2-dioxaborolan-4-one; gamma.hexalactone; gamma.lactone; 1.4: 3.6-dianhydro-2.5-di-O-nitro-D-glucitol; 4-hydroxy-3-methyl-6-propan-2-ylcyclohex-2-en-1-one; 2-hydroxy-3-phenylpropanoic acid; shikimic acid; loliolide; rosifoliol; and 4H-1-Benzopyran -4-one, 5.7-dihydroxy-2-methyl.</p>
