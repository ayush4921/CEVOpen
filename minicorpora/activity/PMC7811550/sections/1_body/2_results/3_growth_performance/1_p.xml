<p>Across the whole experiment, live weights increased in all experimental groups. Significant changes in broiler live weights were noted during the 1
 <sup>st</sup> week of the experiment, during which live weights from experimental Group III broilers increased by 11.3-16.3% (p≤0.05) compared to those in the control group. A similar pattern was observed at the end of the experiment, during which live weights significantly increased by 14.0% in relation to the control group (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table-3</xref>). Broiler chickens from Group III also demonstrated an average daily gain increase of 18.3% (p≤0.05), and an absolute increase of 18.29% live weight (p≤0.05), in comparison to broilers in the control group. Broilers in Groups I, II, and III had lower feed intakes, amounting to 6.70-7.26% less than that of broilers in the control group.
