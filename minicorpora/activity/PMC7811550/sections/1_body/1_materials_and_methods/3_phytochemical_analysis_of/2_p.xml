<p>Dry extract was redissolved in methanol before chromatography-mass spectrometry and then introduced into the analytical cell of the chromatograph using a Hamilton 1700 microsyringe. Analysis was performed on a gas chromatograph with a mass-selective detector (GQCMS 2010 Plus, Shimadzu, Japan) on an HP-5MS column. GCMS PostRun Analysis software (GCMS Solutions) was used to interpret the results. A set of spectra libraries, namely, CAS, NIST08, Mainlib, Wiley9, and DD2012 Lib, were used to identify compounds. The quantitative presence of individually identified components was estimated by its relative value (%), with a correlation of the peak area to the total area of the extract.</p>
