<p>Dietary doses of 0.05, 0.10, and 0.20 ml of gamma-octalactone/kg live weight/day had a direct impact on the hematological parameters of broiler chickens. At 42 days of age, there was a decrease in the ALB (p≤0.05) and urea (p≤0.05) levels in the blood serum of broiler chickens in experimental Group III, with an increase in triglycerides (p≤0.05) and UA (p≤0.05), in comparison with the control group. Similarly, broilers in Group I had increased levels of urea (p≤0.01), UA and triglycerides (p≤0.05), and decreased levels of cholesterol (by 25.9%, p≤0.05) relative to those in the control group (
