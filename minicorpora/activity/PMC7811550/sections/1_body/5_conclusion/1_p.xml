<p>The biologically active substances within plant extracts, which perform protective functions for plant tissues, can have ambiguous effects on the animal body. The results of our research indicate that the provision of gamma-octalactone, contained in 
 <italic>E. viminalis</italic> leaf extract, led to changes in broiler chickens. More specifically, in broiler chickens, gamma-octalactone impacts digestive enzyme activity, as assessed through blood plasma, increases live weight, and positively affects lipid metabolism.
