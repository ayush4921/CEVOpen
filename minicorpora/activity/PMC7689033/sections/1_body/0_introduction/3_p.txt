0: The biosynthetic pathway of terpenoids in plants starts with the synthesis of the universal terpenoid precursors isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) through the mevalonate (MVA) or the methylerythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathways.
1: Isoprenyl diphosphate synthases (IDSs) catalyze reactions involving IPP and DMAPP, forming the intermediate phosphate precursors, geranyl diphosphate (GPP), geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP), and farnesyl diphosphate, which are then catalyzed by terpene synthases (TPSs) to form diverse terpenoids ( Chen et al., 2003;  Cheng et al., 2007;  Ma et al., 2012).
2: The enzymes in the MVA pathway have been shown to be located in cytosol or peroxisomes, whereas all the enzymes involved in the MEP pathway are found in plastids ( Reumann et al., 2007;  Simkin et al., 2011).
3: In contrast, the localizations of IDSs and TPSs are more diverse and are often at the site of terpenoid biosynthesis ( Ma et al., 2012).
4: Although characterizations of the genes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis have been reported in many plant species, including peppermint,  Arabidopsis, conifers,  Hevea brasiliensis, and  Salvia miltiorrhiza ( Battaile and Loomis, 1961;  Lange and Ghassemian, 2003;  Sando et al., 2008a,b;  Zulak and Bohlmann, 2010;  Ma et al., 2012), many of the enzyme-encoding genes have yet to be elucidated because of the complexity of the terpenoid biosynthesis pathway, especially in the species without a whole-genome sequence.
