0: In the studies of  C. camphora, transcriptome analyses for leaves of camphor trees of linalool-, borneol-, camphor-, cineol-, and iso-nerolidol types led to the identification of 424 unigenes in the biosynthetic pathways of terpenoids ( Jiang et al., 2014) and transcriptome profiling of linalool and borneol types of  C. camphora identified three monoterpene synthase genes possibly involved in the biosynthesis of borneol ( Chen et al., 2018).
1: Although these two transcriptome studies have provided valuable insights into the terpenoid biosynthesis pathway, comparisons between only high-oil-yielding individuals could exclude the identification of genes upstream of the biosynthetic pathway of terpenoids.
2: In this study, we used RNA-Seq to identify key enzyme-encoding genes putatively associated with terpenoid biosynthesis in  C. camphora, which may partially determine its essential oil composition.
3: Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between camphor trees of linalool-type and low-oil-yield camphor trees were identified.
4: In addition to four unigenes in the monoterpenoid biosynthesis pathway, this analysis also identified three unigenes in the terpenoid backbone biosynthesis pathway.
5: Overall, these results contribute to the general understanding of terpenoid biosynthesis in  C. camphora and provide a theoretical basis for metabolic engineering of terpenoids in this species.
