 <italic>Cinnamomum camphora</italic> is an evergreen tree widely distributed around the southern portions of the Yantze River in China, with the largest numbers in Jiangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, Yunnan, and Sichuan.

 <italic>C. camphora</italic> plantations are characterized by fast growth and high afforestation density, and therefore, they can provide a large number of raw materials for the essential oil industry.
