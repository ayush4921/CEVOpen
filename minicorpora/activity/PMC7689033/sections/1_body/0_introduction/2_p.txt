0: Essential oils in the camphor tree primarily consist of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes.
1: Depending on the principal chemical component of their essential oils, camphor trees can be divided into different chemical types, such as linalool, borneol, camphor, cineol, and iso-nerolidol ( Guo et al., 2017).
2: With the gradual improvements in  C. camphora cultivation and essential oil extraction techniques, use of  C. camphora as a source of natural linalool, which has long been preferred over its synthetic form for the perfume industry, is becoming more popular.
3: However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the terpenoid biosynthesis in  C. camphora are still poorly understood, which impedes the progress of identifying superior  C. camphora clones that could increase the efficiency of using  C. camphora for essential oil production.
