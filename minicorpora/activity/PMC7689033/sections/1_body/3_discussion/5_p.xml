<p>Other genes of interest emerged from this study, which include several members of the WRKY family. 
 <italic>WRKY21-like</italic>, 
 <italic>WRKY47-like</italic>, and 
 <italic>WRKY65-like</italic> were all up-regulated in the leaves with high oil content (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS6">Supplementary Table S6</xref>). WRKY transcription factors have been reported to regulate the expression of genes involved in terpene biosynthesis in many species, including 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, cotton, 
 <italic>Artemisia annua</italic>, 
 <italic>Catharanthus roseus</italic>, and others (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2004</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Mao et al., 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Suttipanta et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, it was suggested that the linalool-type 
 <italic>C. osmophloeum</italic> contains a W-box element (T)(T)TGAC(C/T) in the promoter region of the linalool synthase gene, enabling regulation by WRKY transcription factors (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2014</xref>). Based on these previous studies, we suspect that members of the WRKY family might be involved in the regulation of terpene synthase genes of 
 <italic>C. camphora</italic> and therefore could potentially play critical roles in the quantitative difference of oil contents between different chemotypes.
