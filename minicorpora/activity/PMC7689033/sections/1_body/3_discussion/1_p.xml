 <italic>C. camphora</italic> oils have a wide variety of uses, including ornamental, medicinal, and industrial, which makes understanding the regulation of essential oil biosynthesis in camphor tree highly important (

 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). Because of earlier unregulated harvesting, many natural sources of camphor trees have been exhausted. In response to this, camphor tree plantations have been established in many countries including China and Japan. These camphor trees are maintained as bushes and are harvested for twigs and leaves before essential oil extraction. Camphor trees can be divided into different chemotypes based on their main terpenoid components. In this study, we identified camphor trees of linalool type and low oil contents without a dominant terpene component. A total of 26 main components were identified by GC-MS. We further demonstrated that the chemical components in the essential oils of 
 <italic>C. camphora</italic> leaf extracts contained mainly monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes with very minor quantities of diterpenes (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Moreover, linalool took up âˆ¼90 of the total essential oil contents in linalool type, indicating that monoterpene levels account for the major difference between the essential oils of different chemotypes.
