<p>All in all, this study identified a cohort of genes in the terpenoid backbone biosynthesis and monoterpenoid biosynthesis pathways that were commonly up-regulated in leaves with high linalool contents compared to leaves with low oil contents. The knowledge obtained from this study could facilitate manipulation of camphor tree essential oil production through metabolic engineering of essential oil biosynthesis. Additional studies should focus on the isolation of monoterpene synthases genes from different chemotypes of 
 <italic>C. camphora</italic>. Additionally, functional analyses are needed to demonstrate the impact of these genes on terpenoid production.
