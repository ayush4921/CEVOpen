<p>To get a better understanding of the dynamic processes of terpenoid biosynthesis in 
 <italic>C. camphora</italic>, we performed transcriptome analyses of camphor leaves with high and low oil contents based on the oil yield and GC-MS results (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Trimmed reads were mapped to the 
 <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome assembly of 
 <italic>C. camphora</italic>. PCA demonstrated a good similarity between samples in the high- and low-oil-content groups (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS2">Supplementary Figure S2A</xref>). Similarly, the range of Pearson correlation coefficient between two samples in each experimental group is 0.93–0.96 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS2">Supplementary Figure S2B</xref>), also indicating that the samples in the same groups are highly correlated. Further transcriptome analysis identified 3,689 DEGs with 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 and |log2 fold_change| &gt; 2, which comprised 2,120 up-regulated and 1,569 down-regulated unigenes. The GO terms “metabolic process” in the “biological process” category and “catalytic activity” in the “molecular function” category were the two most highly represented within DEGs (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS3">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). In accordance with the GO analysis, KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that most of the 3,689 DEGs were in “metabolism” class (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>), which included “biosynthesis of secondary metabolites,” “phenylpropanoid biosynthesis,” “monoterpenoid biosynthesis,” “terpenoid backbone biosynthesis,” and other pathways (
