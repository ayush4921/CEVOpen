<p>Mature leaves of linalool-type and low-oil-yield 
 <italic>C. camphora</italic> were harvested from 3-year-old clones grown at the experimental garden of NanChang Institute of Technology, China, in October. The clones were propagated from mother trees through cutting propagation. For each biological replicate (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3), leaves from at least five tree clones, which were cloned from the same mother tree, were collected and mixed. The three replicates each for the low-oil-yield variety and linalool-type 
 <italic>C. camphora</italic> were termed N- (1–3) and LI- (1–3) separately. All the samples were harvested and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at −80°C until RNA extraction. Meanwhile, leaves were also collected for oil extraction and chemical component determination.
