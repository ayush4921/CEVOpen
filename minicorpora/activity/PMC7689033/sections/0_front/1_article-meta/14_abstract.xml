 <p>The roots, bark, and leaves of 
  <italic>Cinnamomum camphora</italic> are rich in essential oils, which mainly comprised monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. Although the essential oils obtained from 
  <italic>C. camphora</italic> have been widely used in pharmaceutical, medicinal, perfume, and food industries, the molecular mechanisms underlying terpenoid biosynthesis are poorly understood. To address this lack of knowledge, we performed transcriptome analysis to investigate the key regulatory genes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis in 
  <italic>C. camphora</italic>. High-oil-yield trees of linalool type and low-oil-yield trees were used to assemble a 
  <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome of 
  <italic>C. camphora</italic>. A total of 121,285 unigenes were assembled, and the total length, average length, N50, and GC content of unigenes were 87,869,987, 724, 1,063, and 41.1%, respectively. Comparison of the transcriptome profiles of linalool-type 
  <italic>C. camphora</italic> with trees of low oil yield resulted in a total of 3,689 differentially expressed unigenes, among them 31 candidate genes had annotations associated with metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides, including four in the monoterpenoid biosynthesis pathway and three in the terpenoid backbone biosynthesis pathway. Collectively, this genome-wide transcriptome provides a valuable tool for future identification of genes related to essential oil biosynthesis. Additionally, the identification of a cohort of genes in the biosynthetic pathways of terpenoids provides a theoretical basis for metabolic engineering of essential oils in 
  <italic>C. camphora</italic>.
