0: Essential oils (EOs) and extracts of rose geranium (  Pelargonium graveolens) and petals of rose (  Rosa damascena) have been fully characterized in terms of composition, safety, antimicrobial, and antiviral properties.
1: They were analyzed against   Escherichia coli,   Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium,   Staphylococcus aureus,   Aspergillus niger, and Adenovirus 35.
2: Their toxicity and life span were also determined.
3: EO of   P. graveolens (5%) did not retain any antibacterial activity (whereas at 100% it was greatly effective against   E. coli), had antifungal activity against   A. niger, and significant antiviral activity.
4: Rose geranium extract (dilutions 2590%) (  v/  v) had antifungal and antibacterial activity, especially against   E. coli, and dose-dependent antiviral activity.
5: Rose petals EO (5%) retains low inhibitory activity against   S. aureus and   S. Typhimurium growth (about 2030%), antifungal activity, and antiviral activity for medium to low virus concentrations.
6: Rose petals extract had significant antibacterial activity at dilutions of 2590%, especially against   E. coli and   S. Typhimurium, antifungal, and the most potent antiviral activity.
7: None of the EOs and extracts were toxic in dilutions of up to 5% and 90%, respectively.
8: Finally, all materials had a life span of more than eight weeks.
9: These results support the aspect that rose petals and rose geranium EOs, and extracts, have beneficial antimicrobial and antiviral properties and they can be used as natural preservatives.
