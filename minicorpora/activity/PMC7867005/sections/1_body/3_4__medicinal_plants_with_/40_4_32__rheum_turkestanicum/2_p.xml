<p>Generally, the antidiabetic effects of the 
 <italic>Rheum</italic> genus may be related to the presence of high amounts of anthraquinones and flavonoids. They work through the regulating genes involved in the control of metabolism, enhancing the effect of insulin on glucose uptake, decreasing glucose absorption from the small intestine, enhancing glucose uptake in tissues, reducing gluconeogenesis, stimulating insulin release from
