<p>In another study, the oral administration of 
 <italic>Z. spina-christi</italic> leaf extract, plain or formulated for 28 days, reduced blood glucose level along with a significant increase in serum insulin level and antioxidant capacity. A normalization of the percentage of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C %) and a dose-dependent inhibitory activity of the extract against 
 <italic>Î±</italic>-amylase was also reported. 
 <italic>Z. spina-christi</italic> leaf extract improved the glucose level in diabetic rats by increasing insulin secretion, which may be due to both saponin and polyphenols contents; attenuating meal-derived glucose absorption, which might be attributed to the total polyphenols; and restoring liver and muscle glycogen content, together with significantly decreasing hepatic glucose-6-phosphatase and increasing glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activities [
