 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase and 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase are the key enzymes for controlling the postprandial blood sugar level and managing hyperglycemia. The aqueous extract of 
 <italic>C. coccineum</italic> demonstrated a relatively high 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase inhibitory activity and a moderate inhibition of 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase, indicating that the edible plant can be a diet-based solution for managing the early stages of diabetes when coupled with other pharmacological management strategies [
