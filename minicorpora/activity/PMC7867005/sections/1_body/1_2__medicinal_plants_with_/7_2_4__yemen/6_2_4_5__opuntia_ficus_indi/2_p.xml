<p>This result is supported by Al-Naqeb, who studied the effect of the oil seed in Streptozocin diabetic rats and its molecular mechanisms. Oil extracts exhibited strong antioxidant actives and caused a significant reduction in plasma glucose level in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, the extract elicited an increase in the expression level of the glucose transporter 2 (Slc2a2) gene that is present in the liver, the activity of which would be essential for both glucose secretion and for keeping the intracellular Glu-6-phosphate concentration low, avoiding the permanent activation of glycolytic and lipogenic genes [
