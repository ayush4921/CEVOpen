<p>Ursane, oleanane, and lupine of Olibanum were identified to be responsible for the observed activity in many cases [

The pharmacological testing for the water extract in streptozocin-nicotinamide diabetic rats showed a hypoglycemic effect resembling that of glibenclamide and metformin. The effect is possibly due to the stimulation of insulin secretion from the remaining 
 <italic>β</italic>-cells, the antioxidant activity, and the increase in serum insulin [

 <italic>B. carterii</italic> exhibited antidiabetic action through liver glycogen, the inhibition of degenerative changes in the 
 <italic>β</italic>-cells of the pancreas in an alloxan diabetic model, and the suppression of apoptosis of peri-insular cells, and these effects were attributed to
