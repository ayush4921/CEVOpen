  <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> (
  <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>) biofilm formation (BF) is emerging thread worldwide. For tackling this problem, we have chosen Hibiscus rosa-. pneumoniae. The HPLC purified essential oils (EOs sinensis (H. rosa-sinensis) (HRS) to inhibit the BF K) of H. rosa-sinensis was performed against BF 
  <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> and showed concentration dependent biofilm inhibition. At the MBIC of EOs (90 µg/ml), the biofilm inhibition was showed at 92% against selected BF 
  <italic>K. Pneumoniae</italic>. The biofilm metabolic assay, exopolysaccharide quantification and hydrophobicity index variation results exhibited with 88%, 92% and 89% reduction at 90 μg/mL was observed respectively. In addition, the morphological modification of MBIC treated 
  <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> was clearly viewed by scanning electron microscope (SEM). Overall, all the invitro experiments result were confirmed that the MBIC of H. rosa-sinensis EOs was very effective against BF 
  <italic>K. pneumonia.</italic>
