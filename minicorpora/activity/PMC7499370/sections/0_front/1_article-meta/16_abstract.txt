0: Recent years   Klebsiella pneumoniae (  K. pneumoniae) biofilm formation (BF) is emerging thread worldwide.
1: For tackling this problem, we have chosen Hibiscus rosa-.
2: pneumoniae.
3: The HPLC purified essential oils (EOs sinensis (H. rosa-sinensis) (HRS) to inhibit the BF K) of H. rosa-sinensis was performed against BF   K. pneumoniae and showed concentration dependent biofilm inhibition.
4: At the MBIC of EOs (90 g/ml), the biofilm inhibition was showed at 92% against selected BF   K. Pneumoniae.
5: The biofilm metabolic assay, exopolysaccharide quantification and hydrophobicity index variation results exhibited with 88%, 92% and 89% reduction at 90 g/mL was observed respectively.
6: In addition, the morphological modification of MBIC treated   K. pneumoniae was clearly viewed by scanning electron microscope (SEM).
7: Overall, all the invitro experiments result were confirmed that the MBIC of H. rosa-sinensis EOs was very effective against BF   K. pneumonia.
