<p id="p0125">The hydrophobicity is important key factor for biofilm production and involved in the initial adherence process. The rate of fimbriae role, flagella and EPS production was also essential factors for attachment of microbial cell onto the bacterial surface. It comes to enhance the increased biofilm formation in bacteria due to the influence of hydrophobicity. The hydrophobic interaction play a role in increase trends with an elevated non-polar nature of the microbial cell surface and substratum surface. In this study, the HI of AEOF treated BF 
 <italic>K. pnemoniae</italic> exhibited with 89% at 90 μg/mL concentration. Whereas, the control result showed with no any changes on their HI (

 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> was significantly reduced when treated with AEOF. As per regulation of physico-chemical theory for bacteria (
