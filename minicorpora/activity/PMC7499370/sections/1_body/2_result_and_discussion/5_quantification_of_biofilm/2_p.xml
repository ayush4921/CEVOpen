<p id="p0100">Anti-biofilm ability of AEOF was exhibited with complete biofilm inhibition against selected 
 <italic>K. pneumonia</italic>. The result indicated that the AEOF have neither anti-bacterial nor anti-biofilm activity at very low concentration when compared to control. Among the various concentration, 90 µg/ml was exhibited 92 and 89% inhibition against CRBF 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> and biofilm positive control 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> BDUMS 3 (KY617770). When compared with previous report, the present result of 90 µg/ml concentration was very low against MDR pathogens (
 <xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>a). This study suggested that the AEOF was excellent bacteriostatic agent against GNB, and 90 µg/ml was fixed as a biofilm inhibition concentration (BIC). In addition, crystal violet staining assay exhibited that the rigidity of biofilm structure was degraded at the same concentration when compared with untreated control (
 <xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>a-Inset figures-1). It revealed that the adherent cells were degraded by BIC and exhibited highest inhibition result after bound with CV. The sparred cells of biofilm arrangement in the treated bacteria indicate that the AEOF has extracellular polysaccharide matrix damage ability through peptidoglycon layer and teichoic acid (

 <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> essential oil has more inhibition ability against EPS and Hydrophobicity index (
