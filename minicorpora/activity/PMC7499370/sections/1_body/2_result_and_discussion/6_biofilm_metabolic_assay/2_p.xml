<p id="p0105">After treatment with BIC of AEOF, the treated bacterial viability significantly decreased at increasing concentration. Bacterial viability is one of the important mechanistic approaches in biofilm inhibition (
 <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">Maruthupandy et al., 2020</xref>). After 24 h incubation, the bacteria loss their antigenic characters like QS, enzyme production, gene stimulation and biofilm formation due to the arrest of formazan production (

This evidence was compared with biofilm quantification result and suggested that the metabolic activity was reduced in the test samples. In our study, the 10 μg/mL of AEOF was released the bacteriostatic effect and extended to up to 90 μg/mL with 7 and 88% of reduction (
