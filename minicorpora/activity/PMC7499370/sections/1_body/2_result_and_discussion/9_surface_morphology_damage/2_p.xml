<p id="p0130">Morphological damage of BIC treated bacteria was clearly depicted in SEM images 
 <xref rid="f0040" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>. The surface integrity of bacteria was modified due to the effect of AEOF (
 <xref rid="f0040" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>b). Whereas, tightly packed, attached rod shaped cells were observed in untreated control cells (
 <xref rid="f0040" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>a). Cell wall of the bacteria was shown with membrane corrugation damage with belb formation (
 <xref rid="f0040" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>c). In addition, arrangement of hank-like exopolysaccharides with organization of EPS was significantly damaged and degraded due to the exposure of AEOF (
 <xref rid="f0040" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>d). The result also expressed, a stress responses of the AEOF on bacteria surface was continuously pushed and cleaved the surface, it leads to complete permeation of AEOF inside the cells and shown with irregular shape. It may leads to low electron dense in the inside of the periplasmic space and cytoplasm of the cells creates the fluid discharge (
