0: Recent years, biofilm forming (BF) Gram negative bacteria (GNB) has attracted more attention due to their potential risk of antimicrobial resistance and virulence factor production ( Rubini et al., 2018).
1: Biofilm formation now being considered as a serious problem and it can be developing the resistant against antiseptic agents ( Doulgeraki et al., 2017,  Rajivgandhi et al., 2018a).
2: In fact, the discovery of novel antimicrobial agents for eradicate the biofilm formation is a worldwide challenge.
3: Recently, plant essential oil has more potential for solving the problem of biofilm producing pathogens ( Francesco et al., 2011,  Eman et al., 2018).
4: EO acts as an excellent antimicrobial agent due to the low viscosity, high capability, excellent surface nature, which allows them to interact with target ( Norhaizan et al., 2010,  Rajivgandhi et al., 2018a).
