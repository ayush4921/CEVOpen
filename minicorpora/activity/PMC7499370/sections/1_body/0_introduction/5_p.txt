0: The seeds of the HRS are mostly used for oil production in many countries, and phytochemical compositions of the oils are applied in various biological process.
1: In the daily meals of West Africa, the HRS leaves and powders are used frequently ( Hui-Min et al., 2017).
2: In addition, the seeds of the HRS is applied to recover high quantifies in various industries like pharmaceutical and food.
3: The HRS oils are mainly synthesized from plastids ( Elemar Gomes et al., 2010).
4: Also, the HRS oil composed with tremendous chemical compounds including terpenes, fats and flavonoid aglycones ( Gandhi et al., 2019).
5: In addition, the more polysaccharide composition of the HRS as a format of secretory idioblasts oil or mucilage, which were associated with the parenchyma of HRS.
6: Plant mucilages are complex polysaccharide polymers, it has high molecular weight.
7: All the mucilages are either acidic or neutral polysaccharides ( Lingesh et al., 2018).
8: Hundred years, EOs as a natural medicine for various serious infections including multi drug resistant bacterial infections.
9: Previously the reported  Origanum majorana,  Thymus zygis,  Rosmarinus officinalis,  Juniperus communis and  Zengiber officinale Eos have excellent inhibitory effect against biofilm formation ( Rihab et al., 2019).
10: Eos has very low toxicity compared with other phytochemical compounds and also, it damaged the bacterial cell wall through hydrophobic channels.
11: Finally, it could enter the inside of the cells and destroy the cell cycle process and cytoplasmic leakages materials ( Erika et al., 2019).
12: Therefore, the current study was initiated an attempt to assess a Chinesh medicinal plant  H. rosa-sinensis EOs as a potential anti-biofilm agent against CR biofilm forming  K. pneumoniae.
