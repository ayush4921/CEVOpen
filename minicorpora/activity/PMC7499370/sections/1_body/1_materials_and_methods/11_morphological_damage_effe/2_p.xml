<p id="p0080">The shape of the BF 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> morphology upon AEOF treatment was analyzed by SEM and TEM (
 <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">Mehran et al., 2019</xref>). Shortly, the pellet of AEOF treated or untreated biofilm sample was received after centrifugation and washed thrice with 1% PBS. Required amount of suspended culture was taken and inoculated on the sterile cover glass, and the sample was fixed by 4% glutaraldehyde for 4 h. After incubation, the sample was washed two times with sterile PBS. After incubation, the fixed cells were filtered by polycarbonate membrane filters and dehydrated with 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 and 100% ethanol graded series. After dehydration, 1 mL of t-butanol was used and incubated at 1 h for bacterial survival. Next, the t-butanol was altered by fresh t-butanal and incubated in deep freezer with overnight. Further, the cover glass was dried at room temperature and coated with gold–palladium metal. Finally, cover glass was viewed under SEM using an accelerating voltage of 20 kV (Shimadzhu, Japan).
