<p id="p0035">GC-MS analysis of 
 <italic>H. rosa-sinensis</italic> EO was followed by the previous report of 
 <xref rid="b0185" ref-type="bibr">Ruhomally et al. (2015)</xref>. Briefly, 1L of the sample was mixed with 1% dichloromethane which injected with split ratio of 1:20 using EI mode of 70 eV (Agilent technologies) attached with split injector and 220 °C as an injector temperature. Continuously, 5% phenyl followed by 95% dimethylpolysiloxane with 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm of HP-5MS was used for separate the chemical components. 1 mL/min of helium carrier gas was used for this process and 60 to 240 °C at a rate of 3 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup> as a oven temperature. Finally, 1 μL of EO was used as a injected volume and diluted with chloroform (1:10).
