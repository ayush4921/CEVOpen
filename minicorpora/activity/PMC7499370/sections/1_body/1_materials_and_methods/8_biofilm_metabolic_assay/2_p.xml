<p id="p0060">The viability of bacterial cells in the presence of AEOF at various concentration was detected by 2,3-bis (2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5- carboxanilide (XTT) reduction method with the modification of 
 <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">Anjugam et al., 2018</xref>. Briefly, after removal of non-adherent biofilm cells, 1 mg/mL mixed XTT solution (12.5) was gently added into the 6-well plate. Subsequently, 1 μL of fresh standardized menadione acetone solution was added into each well with 100 μL of PBS. Each well were shaken gently and incubated with dark condition at 1 h at 37 °C. Whereas, without addition of AEOF in the pathogen with menadione acetone solution containing well served as control. After incubation, all the wells were calculated by using microtitre plate reader at 570 nm. The test was conducted in triplicate and the result was presented using following Eq,
