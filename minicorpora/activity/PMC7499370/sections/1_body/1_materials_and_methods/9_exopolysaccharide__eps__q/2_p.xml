 <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">Maruthupandy et al. (2020)</xref> with some alteration. The BIC of AEOF treated or untreated 
 <italic>K. pneumonia</italic> biofilm culture was collected and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min. For enzymatic degradation, the pellet was re-suspended in sterile saline solution, followed by 50 μL of Pronase E (Hi-Media, India) and vortexed at 30 °C for 30 min. After, 100 μL of trichloroacetic acid was inoculated into precipitate of protein at ice with 1 h. Subsequently, sample was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min with cooling temperature. The 10 mL of cold absolute alcohol was added drop wise to precipitate the polysachaaraide quantitatively and kept at −20 °C for 12 h. After incubation, the sample was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 20 min for collection of polysaccharides and resuspended in 1 mL of D·H
 <sub>2</sub>O Further, the sample was digested with 5 mL of H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> (98%) into the monosaccharides with continuous vortex. After vortex, 5% phenol (1 mL) was added into recovered material and vortexed for 20 min in water bath. Samples were cooled on ice, and result was read at spectrophotometer (UV-2550, Shimadzu, Japan) at 540 nm wavelength. Dis·H2O served as a blank. In this method, glucose as a standard. The experiment was conducted in triplicate and the result was calculated in inhibition percentage of EPS with following formula
