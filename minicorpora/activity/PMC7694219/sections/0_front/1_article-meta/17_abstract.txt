0: Thymus vulgaris L. is an aromatic herb used for medicinal purposes such as antimicrobial, spasmolytic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive, antitumor, and may have beneficial effects in the treatment of Alzheimers disease.
1: The present study aimed to investigate whether   Thymus vulgaris L. essential oil enhances cognitive function via the action on cholinergic neurons using scopolamine (Sco)-induced zebrafish (  Danio rerio) model of memory impairments.
2: Thymus vulgaris L. essential oil (TEO, 25, 150, and 300 L/L) was administered by immersion to zebrafish once daily for 13 days, whereas memory impairment was induced by Sco (100 M), a muscarinic receptor antagonist, delivered 30 min before behavioral tests.
3: Spatial memory was assessed using the Y-maze test and novel object recognition test (NOR).
4: Anxiety and depression were measured in the novel tank diving test (NTT).
5: Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis was used to study the phytochemical composition of TEO.
6: Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and oxidative stress response in the brain of zebrafish were determined.
7: TEO ameliorated Sco-induced increasing of AChE activity, amnesia, anxiety, and reduced the brain antioxidant capacity.
8: These results suggest that TEO may have preventive and/or therapeutic potentials in the management of memory deficits and brain oxidative stress in zebrafish with amnesia.
