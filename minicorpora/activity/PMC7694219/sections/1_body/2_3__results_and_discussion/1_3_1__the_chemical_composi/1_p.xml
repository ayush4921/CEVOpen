<p>From a chemical point of view, TEO is generally characterized by a large amount of monoterpenes (both hydrocarbons and oxygenated) reaching almost 90% of the whole oil. The two main phenolic monoterpenes, thymol, and carvacrol occur more frequently. These are always accompanied by 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene and γ-terpinene being strictly biogenetically correlated with thymol and carvacrol [

 <xref rid="B59-antioxidants-09-01083" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. 
 <italic>Thymus</italic> is probably the most taxonomically complex genus of the 
 <italic>Lamiaceae</italic> family. Several studies confirming the presence of a significant intraspecific chemical diversity in which the two most common chemotypes, thymol, and carvacrol, are preponderant [
 <xref rid="B60-antioxidants-09-01083" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], followed by less common non-phenolic chemotypes [
 <xref rid="B61-antioxidants-09-01083" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. In particular, the sample subject of this study has a chemical profile quite typical of 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic>, thymol chemotype. Gas chromatography analysis allowed the identification of more than 70 components covering more than 98% of the total oil composition. 
 <xref rid="antioxidants-09-01083-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the detail of the chemical composition, listing only the 41 components with the percentage &gt;0.05. The most represented class is that of oxygenated monoterpenes (59.95%), followed by hydrocarbon monoterpenes (29.45%), the sum of which reaches 89%. Sesquiterpenes and other components are below 10%. The main compound is thymol (42.10%), followed by 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (19.20%) and the sesquiterpene β-caryophyllene (6.40%). Carvacrol is below 3%.
