<p>Oxidative stress is associated with memory impairment in AD [
 <xref rid="B72-antioxidants-09-01083" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. While ROS and free radicals such as superoxide (O
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>−</sup>) and hydrogen peroxide (H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>) are produced during normal metabolism, an imbalance between the ROS production and antioxidant leads to oxidative stress in the body [
 <xref rid="B73-antioxidants-09-01083" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. The body has several antioxidant enzymes, such as SOD and GPX to protect it from oxidative stress [
 <xref rid="B73-antioxidants-09-01083" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. SOD acts as the first-line defense against oxidative stress, catalyzes O
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>−</sup> to oxygen (O
 <sub>2</sub>) and H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, and then H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> is transformed into H
 <sub>2</sub>O by catalase [
 <xref rid="B74-antioxidants-09-01083" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Furthermore, GPX reduces both H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and hydroperoxides by expending glutathione (GSH) [
 <xref rid="B75-antioxidants-09-01083" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. In particular, SOD and GPX play an important role in protecting against oxidative stress in the brain [

 <xref rid="B76-antioxidants-09-01083" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. MDA is one of the most significant aldehydes formed after lipid hydroperoxide breakdown. Hence the involvement of free radical damage in pathologies associated with oxidative stress is considered a good biomarker [
 <xref rid="B77-antioxidants-09-01083" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Furthermore, many studies reported that Sco-induced memory loss is related to increased brain oxidative stress [

 <xref rid="B79-antioxidants-09-01083" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Sco also significantly increases AChE and MDA levels in the cortex and hippocampus [
 <xref rid="B80-antioxidants-09-01083" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. TEO significantly restored the antioxidant status in the zebrafish brain, as evidenced by a significant increase of SOD and GPX activities along with the decrease of the protein carbonyl and MDA levels. Our results are supported by literature concerning the antioxidant effects of the

 <xref rid="B81-antioxidants-09-01083" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. TEO treatment effectively restored the antioxidant defense mechanism by increasing the antioxidant levels of activity in the brain.
