<p>Pearson correlation coefficient (
 <italic>r</italic>) was used to evaluate the relationship between cognition, antioxidant enzymes, and lipid peroxidation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-01083-f006">Figure 6</xref>). A high negative correlation between the exploring time of the novel object vs. MDA (
 <italic>n</italic> = 10, 
 <italic>r</italic> = −0.679, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-01083-f006">Figure 6</xref>A) was noticed. The negative value of the 
 <italic>r</italic> indicates that the improvement of behavioral scores in NOR is well correlated with a low level of MDA, a marker of lipid peroxidation. Additionally, high negative correlations were evidenced by linear regression between GPX vs. MDA (
 <italic>n</italic> = 10, 
 <italic>r</italic> = −0.816, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-01083-f006">Figure 6</xref>C) and GSH vs. MDA (
 <italic>n</italic> = 10, 
 <italic>r</italic> = −0.658, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-01083-f006">Figure 6</xref>D). However, a positive significant correlation between AChE vs. MDA (
 <italic>n</italic> = 10, 
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.676, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-01083-f006">Figure 6</xref>B) and protein carbonyl vs. MDA (
 <italic>n</italic> = 10, 
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.871, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-01083-f006">Figure 6</xref>E) was noticed when linear regression was calculated. In this case, the positive values of the 
 <italic>r</italic> indicate that decreasing of ACh activity and protein carbonyl level is well correlated with decreasing of the MDA level. Kindl et al. [
 <xref rid="B71-antioxidants-09-01083" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] also demonstrated a relationship between the antioxidant and anticholinesterase potential of the 
 <italic>Thymus</italic> species. By using the determination of the 
 <italic>r</italic>, we have shown that improvement of the memory performance in Sco-treated rats is linked to increased antioxidant enzyme activity along with a decreased lipid peroxidation level, supporting the neuroprotective profile of TEO.
