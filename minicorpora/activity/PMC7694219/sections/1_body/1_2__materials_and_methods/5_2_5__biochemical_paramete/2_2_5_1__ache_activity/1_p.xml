<p>The activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE, EC 3.1.1.7) was determined by the defined approach as previously described by Ellman et al. [
 <xref rid="B50-antioxidants-09-01083" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], using acetylthiocholine chloride (ATC) as artificial substrate. The reaction mixture (600 μL) included 0.26 M phosphate buffer with pH 7.4, 1 mM 5.5′-dithio-bis-2 nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB), and 5 mM ATC. The assay was started by adding supernatant and then by developing the yellow color at 412 nm for 10 min at room temperature. Suitable controls have been performed for the non-enzymatic hydrolysis of ATC. The specific activity of the enzyme was formulated as nmol of ACT/min per/mg of protein.
