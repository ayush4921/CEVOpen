<p>The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC 1.15.1.1) was determined as described by Winterbourn et al. [
 <xref rid="B51-antioxidants-09-01083" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The reaction mixture (1.5 mL) contained 100 mM TRIS/HCl (pH 7.8), 75 mM NBT, 2 μM riboflavin, 6 mM EDTA, and 200 μL supernatant. The monitoring of the increase in absorbance at 560 nm followed the blue formazan output. One unit of SOD is defined as the amount of the enzyme required to inhibit the rate of NBT reduction by 50%. The specific activity of the enzyme was expressed in units/mg protein.
