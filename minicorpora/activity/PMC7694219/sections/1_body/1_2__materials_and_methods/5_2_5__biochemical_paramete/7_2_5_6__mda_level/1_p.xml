<p>A malondialdehyde (MDA) level assay was performed according to previous protocol described by Ohkawa et al. [
 <xref rid="B56-antioxidants-09-01083" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. For this assay, 200 μL of supernatant was mixed with 0.1 M HCl with 1 mL of 50% TCA in 0.1 M HCl and 1 mL of 26 mM thiobarbituric acid. After vortex mixing, samples were held at 95 °C for 20 min. The samples were then centrifuged at 960× 
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min, and the supernatants were read at 532 nm against the control. The concentration of MDA was presented as nmol/mg protein.
