<p>Immediately after behavioral tests, all zebrafish were euthanized (10 min immersion in ice-water, 2–4 °C) until loss of opercular motions [

In ice 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 1.15% KCl with Potter Homogenizer, the brains were gently homogenized. The resulted homogenate was centrifuged at 960×
