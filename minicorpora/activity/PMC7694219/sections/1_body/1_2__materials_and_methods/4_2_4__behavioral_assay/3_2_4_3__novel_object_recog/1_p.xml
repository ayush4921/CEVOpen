<p>NOR is a widely used behavioral assay in zebrafish to examine the memory efficiency [
 <xref rid="B48-antioxidants-09-01083" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The experimental apparatus consists of a 20 L glass tank (30 × 30 × 30 cm) filled with 6 cm of water. The NOR test consists of three phases. In the habituation phase, each animal explores the tank in the absence of the objects for 5 min twice a day (5 h interval between habituation sessions) over 3 consecutive days. In the training phase (on the 4th day), the animals were exposed to two identical hard plastic red cubes for 10 min. In the test phase (1 h after the training phase), a novel object (N, green cube) replaced one of the copies of the familiar objects (F, red cubes), and the exploration time of each object was evaluated for 10 min. The exploration area was established by increasing once the size of the object area; thus, we considered exploration when the fish were up to 2.5 cm far from each side of the object. The behavior was fully analyzed using the ANY-Maze
 <sup>®</sup> software (Stoelting CO, Wood Dale, IL, USA), assessing the exploratory time (s) and the preference percentages. The preference percentages have been determined as (time of exploration of N/time of exploration of F + time of exploration of N × 100) [
