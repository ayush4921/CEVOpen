0: The chemical composition of the TEO has been documented.
1: Thymol has generally been identified to be the main constituent of  Thymus vulgaris, accompanied by carvacrol and linalool [ 28].
2: These compounds have been stated to have also therapeutic properties (e.g., vs.
3: AD) [ 29].
4: For instance, Asadbegi et al.
5: [ 30] demonstrated that thymol decreased the effect on memory damage caused by intrahippocampal injection of the A peptide in high-fat diet-fed rats and could be found as neuroprotective.
6: Additionally, Capibaride et al.
7: [ 31], confirmed the marked antidepressant-like effect of thymol, as demonstrated by its ability to reverse chronic corticosterone-associated behavior and a decrease in BDNF levels in female mice.
8: Furthermore, Formiga et al.
9: [ 32] suggested the intestinal anti-inflammatory function of  p-cymene and rosmarinic acid involving the cytoprotection of the intestinal barrier, the preservation of the mucus layer, and the conservation of communicating junctions, as well as the regulation of the antioxidant and immunomodulatory processes.
10: Azizi et al.
11: [ 33] demonstrated that the neuroprotective effects of carvacrol and thymol against A2535 might be through attenuating oxidative damage and increasing the activity of PKC as a memory-related protein.
12: Besides, -myrcene and caryophyllene within the monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes have been identified as the major compounds.
13: -myrcene is known to have analgesic, anxiolytic, and anti-inflammatory effects [ 34, 35].
14: Caryophyllene was known as an anti-inflammatory compound in some  Cannabis extracts due to interactions with cannabinoid receptors and gastric cytoprotective activity [ 36].
15: Notably, caryophyllene oxide appears to be a multi-target molecule known for its anti-cancer and analgesic properties [ 35].
