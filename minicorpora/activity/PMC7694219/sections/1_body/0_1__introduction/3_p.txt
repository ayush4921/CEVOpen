2: Currently, only a few medications are available on the market with multiple adverse effects.
3: Donepezil is the second approved AChE inhibitor for the treatment of mild to moderate AD by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), extensively used worldwide [ 21].
4: As donepezil is generally tolerated, most adverse events are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle cramps, fatigue, and weight loss [ 22].

6: Besides, memantine used for treating dementia exhibited different side effects such as dizziness, headache, diarrhea, constipation, and confusion [ 24].
7: Natural products from plants represent interesting candidates for the treatment of AD and the present study aimed to identify if the  Thymus vulgaris essential oil (TEO) is a potent source of bioactive compounds to counteract AD [ 25].
