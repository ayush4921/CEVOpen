<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition with significant variability in clinical characteristics and biomarkers and numerous genetic and environmental factors implicated in its etiology and development [

 <xref rid="B2-antioxidants-09-01083" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Moreover, AD is the most prevalent type of dementia in the world and is medically characterized as the pathological deposition of folded β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and hyperphosphorylated neurofibrillary tau tangles in the brain leading to neurodegeneration [

 <xref rid="B4-antioxidants-09-01083" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Clinically, AD poses issues of progressive episodic memory and executive performance across cognitive continuums ranging from cognitively unimpaired (CU), moderate cognitive impairment (MCI), to AD [
 <xref rid="B3-antioxidants-09-01083" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Numerous studies on the brains of AD and dementia patients have consistently reported defects or damage to central cholinergic pathways [
 <xref rid="B5-antioxidants-09-01083" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Given this, the treatment of AD-related dementia is typically done through the use of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors, such as donepezil [

Non-cognitive symptoms associated with AD and related dementias include insanity (delusions, hallucinations), mood disorders (depression, euphoria, irritability, anxiety), behavioral changes (disinhibition, apathy), agitation, anger, slowness, wandering, altered sexual activity, modified sleep habits, and eating disorders [
 <xref rid="B7-antioxidants-09-01083" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Oxidative stress is known to be a very significant factor in ageing and age-related disorders and a large amount of research has shown that oxidative stress is an important pathogenic factor in AD [
 <xref rid="B8-antioxidants-09-01083" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Protein oxidation markers, such as protein carbonyls, have been shown to be increased in AD brains in areas with proven histopathological AD characteristics [
 <xref rid="B9-antioxidants-09-01083" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Protein carbonyls and 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) levels have been increased in the frontal cortex of individuals with MCI, mild AD, and AD, with no distinction between disease stages, a finding that supports the concept of oxidative stress as an early event in AD [
