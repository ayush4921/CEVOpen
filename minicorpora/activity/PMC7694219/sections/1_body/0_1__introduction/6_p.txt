0: In zebrafish, the essential oils from  Thymus quinquecostatus Celak.
1: from the Loess Plateau in China exhibited antioxidant potential mainly by regulating the Nrf2/Keap1 signaling pathway.
2: Rabiei et al.
3: [ 37] reported that  Thymus vulgaris extract has remedial on memory and behavioral disturbances caused by Sco and may have beneficial effects in the treatment of AD.
4: Elaissi et al.
5: [ 38] demonstrated antiproliferative activities of  Thymus numidicus Poir.
6: against two human cancer cell lines: the colonic (HCT116) and breast adenocarcinoma (MCF7), respectively.
7: Butt et al.
8: [ 39] demonstrated that the TEO was found to be a good source of thymoquinone as a chemotherapeutic drug that expressed potent antioxidant and antiproliferative activities.
9: To date, no study indicated the TEO positive effects on memory function in zebrafish against Sco-induced cognitive dysfunction by regulating cholinergic and antioxidant pathways.
10: The present study was therefore organized to examine the phytochemical composition of the TEO and to evaluate the effects on anxiety, cognitive performance, and the brain antioxidant capability in a zebrafish Sco model of amnesia.
