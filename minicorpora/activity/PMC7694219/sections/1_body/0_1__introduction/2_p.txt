0: Scopolamine (Sco) is a cholinergic antagonist of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors known to interfere with acetylcholine production in the central nervous system.
1: This drug was used as a guide for the induction of amnesia in animal models [ 11, 12, 13, 14].
2: The most important characteristic of dementia is memory deterioration, which may be chemically caused by the use of Sco in laboratory animals.
3: The effect of Sco on memory is followed by central cholinergic dysfunction and oxidative stress in zebrafish [ 15].
4: Sco has been characterized as an amnestic agent in zebrafish and is widely used to study memory formation and rescue in conjunction with nootropic and memory-enhancing drugs [ 12].
5: Additionally, Sco has been reported to induce cholinergic deficits and memory impairment via the up-regulation of AChE activity [ 16].
6: Furthermore, there is increasing evidence that Sco interferes with the molecular homeostasis of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and cAMP response element-binding (CREB)/brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in animal models [ 17, 18] while simulating ERK/CREB/BDNF injury in the brains of patients with AD [ 19, 20].
