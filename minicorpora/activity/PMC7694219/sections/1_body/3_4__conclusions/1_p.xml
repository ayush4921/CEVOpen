<p>Considering a very wide range of evidence supporting oxidative stress involvement in neurodegenerative pathologies as well as the fact that AChE inhibition is up to now the most effective therapeutic approach to dementia, this study aimed to evaluate the neuroprotective potential of the TEO by investigating its cognitive-enhancing, anti-AChE and antioxidant activities in Sco zebrafish model. Our study suggested that the cognitive-protecting activities of TEO on Sco-induced memory impairment might result from its effect on improving the cholinergic nervous system and antioxidative stress. To sum up, TEO might be a promising candidate for the treatment of cognitive dysfunction.</p>
