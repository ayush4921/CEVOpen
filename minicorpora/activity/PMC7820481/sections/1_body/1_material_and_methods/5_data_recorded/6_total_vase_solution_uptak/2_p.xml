<p id="p0070">During the vase life evaluation time, the weighting of the vases containing water solutions without cut flowers was recorded every two days. Total days of the vase solution uptake rate were calculated at the end of the vase life period of each treatment by the following formula:
 <disp-formula id="ufd1">Water uptake [g/flower/day] = [ St
  <sup>−1</sup>- St];
 </disp-formula>where, St is the weight of water solution (g) at t = day 2,4,6,etc, and St
 <sup>−1</sup> is the weight of water solution (g) on the previous day (0,2,4,6,etc) by
