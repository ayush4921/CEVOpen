<p id="p0075">Water loss was calculated during the vase life evaluation period. The weighting of the vases containing cut flowers and vase solution were recorded every two days. Total days of the vase solution loss rate were calculated at the end of the vase evaluation period of each treatment as;
 <disp-formula id="ufd2">Water loss (g/flower/ day) = (Ct
  <sup>−1</sup> − Ct);
 </disp-formula>where, Ct is the combination of the weight of cut flowers and the vase solution (g) at t = days 2, 4, 6 and Ct
 <sup>−1</sup> is the combination of the weights of cut flowers and vase solution (g) on 0, 2 and 4 days, respectively, by
