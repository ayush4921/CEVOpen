 <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Solgi et al. (2009)</xref>, who revealed that the thymol, zataria, and thyme oils as antimicrobial agents in combination with 6% sucrose had a significant influence on the shelf-life and relatively fresh weight of the cut flowers. They established that the addition of 100 mg/l of either thymol or zataria and thyme oils positively enhanced the shelf- life to 6–7.5 days of gerbera cut flowers. Additionally, 
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Bayat et al. (2013)</xref> reported a significant response of essential oil added with relative fresh weight and freshness of the flower.
