<p id="p0140">Similar results have reported the positive effect of herbal essential oils on water uptake of cut flowers of astroemeria (

 <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Solgi et al. (2009)</xref> they indicated that the antifungal and antibacterial agents such as carvacrol, thymol, zataria oil, and thyme oil in combination with 6% sucrose had a significant impact on the shelf- life and relative solution uptake of gerbera flowers (

 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Bayat et al. (2013)</xref> mentioned a positive response of essential oil added to the vase solution for cut flower water absorption. Similarly, 
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Bayat et al. (2011)</xref> observed that the highest mean value of relative fresh weight in treatments including EOs compared to the control in the 6th day indicates a higher rate of water uptake by flower and a higher degree of freshness.
