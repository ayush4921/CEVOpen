<p id="p0135">It is quite clear from the data in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure (2)</xref> that total vase water uptake by chrysanthemum cut flowers for all treated groups with thyme and clove oils separately was significantly increased compared to the untreated group (control), which showed a dramatic reduction and resulted in the least total vase water uptake of 164.04 and 163.05 g/flower, in the first and second season, respectively. In addition, the highest values of total vase solution uptake were recorded with the vase solution fortified with 500 mg/l thyme oil as 225.00 and 211.05 g/flower in the two seasons, respectively. Similarly, the vase solution containing 250 mg/l clove oil was significantly increased the total vase water uptake in the first and second seasons (214.40 and 200.10 g/flower, respectively). In contrast, the vase water uptake fortified with 150 mg/l clove oil showed an insignificantly increase in vase solution uptake to the untreated group.
