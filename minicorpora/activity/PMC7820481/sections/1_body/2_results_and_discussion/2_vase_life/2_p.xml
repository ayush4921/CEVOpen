 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ (1)</xref> Indicated that the addition of both thyme oil and clove oil in keeping solution was significantly increasing the vase- life of cut flowers. The longest mean on vase -life (day) was achieved using the preserved solution containing 500 mg/l thyme oil, which recorded (36.50 and 33.40 days, respectively) on both first and second seasons, compared with the control (distilled water) and other treatments. Similarly, the vase of cut flowers was 35.88 and 31.33 days in the first and second seasons, respectively, when 250 mg/l clove oil was preserved. However, the vase life's shortest mean value was recorded with added clove oil at 150 mg/l (22.17 and 19.15 days, respectively) in both seasons. Overall, the results indicated that the essential oils of both thyme and clove in the preservative solution significantly extended the vase life of chrysanthemum cut flowers compared to the control (distilled water).
