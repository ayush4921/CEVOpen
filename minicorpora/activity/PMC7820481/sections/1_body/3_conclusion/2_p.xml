<p id="p0230">As a final summing up, the pulse treatment by thyme and clove oils positively increased the vase life period of cut chrysanthemum cv. ‘‘Arctic Queen White’’ compared with the control. The best effective treatments were thyme oil (500 mg/l) and clove oil (250 mg/l), which longevity the vase life period and improved many postharvest characteristics of cut flowers such as water relation and relative fresh weight, as well as increase the contents of chlorophyll a, b and carotenoids.
