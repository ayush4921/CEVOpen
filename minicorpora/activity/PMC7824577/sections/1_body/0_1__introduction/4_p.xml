<p>Moreover, the good adaptability of 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> to different soils and climate is remarkable, along with its easy propagation [
 <xref rid="B7-foods-10-00031" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], which is directly related to its suitable adaptation to climate change in regions where mild conditions have changed to arid ones, such as in the Mediterranean area. Hence, 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> trees are being promoted as a dual solution to mitigate the impacts of climate change, while also providing an alternative source of income for families. The trees are easy to plant and do not require much maintenance. The planting process includes a water conservation approach that uses only 5 L of water during planting and 250â€“100 mL per day afterwards, decreasing as the tree grows and its roots establish [

 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> tree is twenty times higher than that of the general vegetation [
