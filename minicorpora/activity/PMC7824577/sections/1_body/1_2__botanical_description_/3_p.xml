 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> can be grown by direct seeding, transplanting, or using stem cuttings [
 <xref rid="B16-foods-10-00031" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. It should be noted that this crop is relatively easy to grow since it is spread by sexual and asexual means and it has a low soil nutrient and water demand [
 <xref rid="B17-foods-10-00031" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Optimal conditions for 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> growth are in the warm and semi-arid tropics as it is a very drought tolerant crop growing with rainfall of 250–3000 mm per year and at altitudes below 600 m [
 <xref rid="B18-foods-10-00031" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, it should be noted that its growth has been recorded at 2000 m altitude. It tolerates a wide range of environmental conditions and poorly fertile soils, even withstanding high temperatures, draughts, and light frosts [
 <xref rid="B19-foods-10-00031" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The optimum temperature range is 25–35 °C and it can even withstand 48 °C for a limited period of time [
 <xref rid="B20-foods-10-00031" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> tree develops its maximum productive potential in well-drained sandy or sandy loam soils. It is also able to tolerate clayey soils but not the accumulation of water for prolonged periods of time because it would cause a decrease in growth [
 <xref rid="B21-foods-10-00031" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. It is an extremely fast growing tree; thanks to the high yield of the crop in just three months there is a substantial growth. Normally its growth varies from 5 to 10 m high [
