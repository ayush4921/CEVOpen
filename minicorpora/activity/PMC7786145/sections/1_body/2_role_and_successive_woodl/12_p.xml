<p id="Par26">Aromatic and medicinal plants hosted by the argan ecosystem constitute a precious source of income for communities. Production based on the harvesting of wild growing species represents more than 90% of national production (Zrira 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">2017</xref>). Harvesting is made without any monitoring or scientific support (El Hamdaoui et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2018</xref>). Today, several medicinal and aromatic plants are becoming rare due to unsustainable methods of harvesting and aridity (Bellakhdar et al.

 <italic>T. satureioides</italic>, 
 <italic>T. leptobotrys</italic>, 
 <italic>A. herba</italic>-
 <italic>alba</italic>, 
 <italic>M. suaveolens</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>timija</italic>, 
 <italic>L. dentata</italic>, and 
 <italic>Lavandula mairei</italic> Humbert. These species should be highlighted as requiring urgent conservation, restoration, and sustainable management attention (Barkaoui et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2017</xref>; Lamrani-Alaoui and Hassikou 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2018</xref>). Indeed, these two plants are popular medicinal herbs in Morocco and are widely exported as herbs or essential oils with currently unsustainable use.
