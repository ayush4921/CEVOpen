<p id="Par19">Climatic conditions and alternation phenomenon strongly influence Moroccan production of argan fruits with important variations from one year to another (Aithammou et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2019</xref>). Production of fruits is at its maximum when the tree is 60 years old, and the average yield of fruit per tree is estimated to 8 kg/year (Zrira 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">2017</xref>). Low yield of oil (2â€“2.5 l/100 kg of dried fruit in 58 h of manual extraction) (Charrouf and Guillaume 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2008</xref>) encouraged a mechanized approach. This process has improved oil quality with extraction yield and reduced the time required for oil extraction (Charrouf and Guillaume 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">1999</xref>; Hilali et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2005</xref>). The world market for argan oil enables a trade of 4835 tons (Khallouki et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2017</xref>) and export prices reach over US$400/l (Le Polain de Waroux 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2013</xref>). The nutritional quality of the oil is due to the presence of a high percentage of unsaturated fatty acids especially oleic and linoleic acids (Yaghmur et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">1999</xref>; Khallouki et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2003</xref>).
