<p id="Par27">To protect and conserve argan tree from present overexploitation, it was classified in 1998 as a biosphere Reserve by UNESCO, and many efforts were undertaken by the Moroccan government for its rehabilitation. In 2010, the state created the National Agency for the Development of the Oasis and Argan tree (Agence Nationale pour le Développement des Zones Oasiennes et de l’Arganier (ANDZOA)). ANDZOA aims to realize a sustainable and balanced development within the oasis system and argan forest. This strategy is based on several development actions with regard to restore the argan ecosystem, to carry out or to supervise the realization of projects for the promotion, marketing, and labelling of the products of the argan tree and to encourage scientific research relating to the protection and development of the argan tree and the enhancement of its products. One of the strengths of this strategy is to promote argan tree culture (arganiculture) as a productive activity for alleviate poverty and rehabilitating ecosystems (Perry
