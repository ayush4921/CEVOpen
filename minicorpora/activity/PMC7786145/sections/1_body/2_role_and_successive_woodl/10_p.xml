 <italic>A. herba</italic>-
 <italic>alba</italic> (essential oils, water, and ethyl acetate extracts) showed strong cytotoxicity against cancer cell proliferation (Jaouadi et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">2015</xref>; Bourgou et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">2008</xref>). Antioxidant activity of essential oils has been showed in several studies; this effect is due to the richness of phenolic compounds (Tawaha et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">2007</xref>; Akrout et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2010</xref>). Recent published work on chemical composition of 
 <italic>A. herba-alba</italic> concluded that the high content of oxygenated monoterpenes characterizing in its essential oil may qualify this plant as a potential source of antiviral molecules especially against COVID-19 (Asdadi et al.
