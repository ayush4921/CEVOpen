The compositions of the oil were analyzed by GC-MS, and the major constituents were found to be (E)-cinnamaldehyde (71.50%), linalool (7.00%), β-caryophyllene (6.40%), eucalyptol (5.40%), and eugenol (4.60%). C. zeylanicum essential oil contained remarkable levels of phenolic and bioactive compounds with outstanding ability to scavenge free radicals and inhibit β-carotene oxidation. The growth of pathogenic and spoilage bacteria, especially Gram-positive ones (i.e. Listeria innocua, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus), was highly inhibited by the oil, compared to the Gram-negative pairs (i.e. Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhi). The cells of L. innocua and E. coli (as the most sensitive and resistant strains to the oil, respectively) treated with C. zeylanicum essential oil were observed by scanning electron microscopy to unravel structural changes. It was observed that the essential oil quickly exerted its antibacterial activity through disrupting cell envelope and facilitating the leakage of intracellular compounds. The essential oil had also a dose-dependent antiproliferative effect on adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AT-MSCs), and the cell proliferation could be induced by low concentrations of the oil. The present study indicated that C. zeylanicum essential oil with remarkable antioxidant and antimicrobial properties could be applied to develop novel natural preservatives for food and medicinal purposes.">

        <span class="abst" title="Aims:Ocimum viride Willd. (family: Lamiaceae) is a member of the genus Ocimum, an aromatic annual and perennial herb with numerous culinary, horticultural and ethno-medicinal benefits. This study aims to explore the chemical properties of leaf essential oil (EO) from Ocimum viride and to evaluate its antimicrobial and anticancer potential. Main methods:Characterization of essential oil was done by GCMS, antimicrobial by agar well diffusion methods, in vitro cytotoxicity evaluation by MTT assay, cell death analysis was done by DNA fragmentation, cell cycle analysis, nuclear morphology analysis and molecular docking studies were also conducted. Key findings:Essential oil from aerial parts (leaf) of Ocimum viride revealed high content of oxygenated monoterpenes, notably thymol (~50%) and γ-terpinene (~18%). Further, antibacterial analysis showed that among all the evaluated bacterial species EO showed highest sensitivity against the Bacillus subtilis and was also found most effective against HT-29 colon cancer cell line with IC50 value of ~0.034 ± 0.001μL/mL. Mechanistic studies revealed that EO inhibits the growth of HT-29 colon cancer cells probably through induction of irreparable DNA damage leading to subsequent cell death in apoptotic manner. Molecular docking analysis also supports the in vitro studies conducted by indicating the interaction of thymol with Sec A protein of Bacillus subtilis cell wall as well as with Beclin protein responsible for apoptotic corpse clearance. Significance:Taken together, our results indicate that EO possesses potent antimicrobial and anticancer properties, and may find applications as effective antibacterial and in cancer therapeutics.">

Several constituents (25) were found in one-week dried herbs' oil as compared to the fresh, two-, and three-weeks oils, which consisted of 23, 19, and 14 constituents, respectively, leading to the recommendation of the one-week drying of the herb for maximum oil yield.

        <span class="abst" title="Petasites hybridus (Common butterbur) is extensively used in traditional medicine, and is currently gaining interest and popularity as a food supplement and for its medicinal properties. It contains a large number of active compounds of potential therapeutic activity, but also toxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids. Science-based information is needed to support the developing modern use of this plant, and to direct continued safe practice in traditional medicine. The present study focused on the essential oils from leaves and rhizomes of the understudied P. hybridus ssp. ochroleucus from the Balkans, and evaluated its phytochemistry and potential therapeutic activities (antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-cholinesterase and anti-inflammatory), as well its toxicology potential (acute toxicity in insects and mice). We studied the essential oils, which are not commonly used in traditional practices, but have a potential for safe use since the toxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids, which are non-volatiles, are usually not present in the distilled essential oils. Pyrrolizidine alkaloids were indeed not detected in the essential oils; ingestion of the essential oils did not induce toxicity signs in mice, and topical application did not elicit skin irritation in humans. The essential oils had no antimicrobial properties against 20 pathogenic bacterial strains, but demonstrated good local anti-inflammatory activity in a Carrageenan-induced paw edema test. An insect toxicity test demonstrated that the leaf essential oil is an efficient insect repellent, and the demonstrated anti-cholinesterase activity suggests a potential for the treatment of neurological conditions. Isopetasin, a sesquiterpene found in plants of the genus Petasites, known to have anti-inflammatory effects, was present only in the rhizomes essential oil (3.9%), and sesquiterpene lactones concentrations were high, likely contributing to the antioxidant activity.">

Therefore, there is an urgent need to discover new classes of potent antimicrobial agents with novel modes of action. &lt;i&gt;Cannabis sativa&lt;/i&gt; is an herbaceous plant that has been used for millennia for medicinal and recreational purposes. Its bioactivity is largely due to a class of compounds known as cannabinoids. Recently, these natural products and their analogs have been screened for their antimicrobial properties, in the quest to discover new anti-infective agents.

An inhibition assay was performed &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; using &lt;i&gt;Eimeria tenella&lt;/i&gt; Wisconsin strain sporozoites and Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells. Intracellular sporozoite invasion was quantified by detection of &lt;i&gt;E. tenella&lt;/i&gt; DNA using qPCR from cell monolayers harvested at 2 and 24 h post-infection. Parasite invasion was inhibited by the oregano essential oil at the concentration of 100 μg/ml by 83 or 93% after 2 or 24 h, respectively. Garlic essential oil reached a maximum inhibition of 70% after 24 h with the 50 μg/ml concentration. Normal morphology was observed in MDBK cells exposed to concentrations of 100 μl/ml of garlic or oregano for over 24 h. In the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; trial, 180 male broiler chicks (45.3 ± 0.7 g) were allocated into two treatments (6 pens of 15 chicks per treatment). Control treatment was fed commercial diets without antibiotics or anticoccidials. The ORE-GAR treatment was fed the same control diets, further supplemented with a premix (1 g/kg feed) containing the oregano (50 g/kg premix) and garlic (5 g/kg premix) essential oils. At day 37, all birds were slaughtered under commercial conditions, and intestinal samples were collected. ORE-GAR treatment had improved final body weight (1833.9 vs. 1.685.9 g; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.01), improved feed conversion ratio (1.489 vs. 1.569; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.01), and reduced fecal oocyst excretion (day 28: 3.672 vs. 3.989 log oocysts/g, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.01; day 37: 3.475 vs. 4.007 log oocysts/g, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.001). In the caecal digesta, ORE-GAR treatment had lower total anaerobe counts (8.216 vs. 8.824 CFU/g; p &lt; 0.01), whereas in the jejunum digesta the ORE-GAR treatment had higher counts of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; (5.030 vs. 3.530 CFU/g; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.01) and &lt;i&gt;Enterobacteriaceae&lt;/i&gt; (5.341 vs. 3.829 CFU/g; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.01), and lower counts of &lt;i&gt;Clostridium perfringens&lt;/i&gt; (2.555 vs. 2.882 CFU/g; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.01).

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Ethnopharmacological relevance&lt;/h4&gt;Due to the outbreaks such as SARS, bird flu and swine flu, which we frequently encounter in our century, we need fast solutions with no side effects today more than ever. Due to having vast ethnomedical experience and the richest flora (34% endemic) of Europe and the Middle East, Turkey has a high potential for research on this topic. Plants that locals have been using for centuries for the prevention and treatment of influenza can offer effective alternatives to combat this problem. In this context, 224 herbal taxa belonging to 45 families were identified among the selected 81 studies conducted in the seven regions of Turkey. However, only 35 (15.6%) of them were found to be subjected to worldwide in vitro and in vivo research conducted on anti-influenza activity. Quercetin and chlorogenic acid, the effectiveness of which has been proven many times in this context, have been recorded as the most common (7.1%) active ingredients among the other 56 active substances identified.&lt;h4&gt;Aim of the study&lt;/h4&gt;This study has been carried out to reveal the inventory of plant species that have been used in flu treatment for centuries in Turkish folk medicine, which could be used in the treatment of flu or flu-like pandemics, such as COVID 19, that humanity has been suffering with, and also compare them with experimental studies in the literature.&lt;h4&gt;Materials and methods&lt;/h4&gt;The investigation was conducted in two stages on the subject above by using electronic databases, such as Web of Science, Scopus, ScienceDirect, ProQuest, Medline, Cochrane Library, EBSCO, HighWire Press, PubMed and Google Scholar. The results of both scans are presented in separate tables, together with their regional comparative analysis.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Data obtained on taxa are presented in a table, including anti-influenza mechanism of actions and the active substances. Rosa canina (58.7%) and Mentha x piperita (22.2%) were identified as the most common plants used in Turkey. Also, Sambucus nigra (11.6%), Olea europaea (9.3%), Eucalyptus spp., Melissa officinalis, and Origanum vulgare (7.0%) emerged as the most investigated taxa.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;This is the first nationwide ethnomedical screening work conducted on flu treatment with plants in Turkey. Thirty-nine plants have been confirmed in the recent experimental anti-influenza research, which strongly shows that these plants are a rich pharmacological source. Also, with 189 (84.4%) taxa, detections that have not been investigated yet, they are an essential resource for both national and international pharmacological researchers in terms of new natural medicine searches. Considering that the production of antimalarial drugs and their successful use against COVID-19 has begun, this correlation was actually a positive and remarkable piece of data, since there are 15 plants, including Centaurea drabifolia subsp. Phlocosa (an endemic taxon), that were found to be used in the treatment of both flu and malaria.">

        <span class="abst" title="Invasive species are considered as one of the major threats to ecosystems worldwide. Although invasive plants are regarded as a foe, they could be considered as natural resources for valuable bioactive compounds. The present study aimed to characterize the chemical composition of the essential oil (EO) from the invasive plant &lt;i&gt;Argemone ochroleuca&lt;/i&gt; Sweet, collected from Saudi Arabia, as well as to evaluate its phytotoxic activity. Seventy-four compounds were characterized via GC-MS analysis of EO representing 98.75% of the overall mass. The oxygenated constituents (79.01%) were found as the main constituents, including mono- (43.27%), sesqui- (17.67%), and di-terpenes (0.53%), as well as hydrocarbons (16.81%) and carotenoids (0.73%). Additionally, 19.69% from the overall mass was characterized as non-oxygenated compounds with mono- (1.77%), sesquiterpenes (17.41%), and hydrocarbons (0.56%) as minors. From all identified constituents, &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-chrysanthenyl acetate (25.71%), &lt;i&gt;γ&lt;/i&gt;-cadinene (11.70%), oleic acid, methyl ester (7.37%), terpinene-4-ol (4.77%), dihydromyrcenol (2.90%), &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;-muurolene (1.77%), and &lt;i&gt;γ&lt;/i&gt;-himachalene (1.56%) were found as abundant. The EO of &lt;i&gt;A. ochroleuca&lt;/i&gt; showed significant phytotoxic activity against the test plant &lt;i&gt;Lactuca sativa&lt;/i&gt; and the noxious weed &lt;i&gt;Peganum harmala.&lt;/i&gt; The EO attained IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values of 92.1, 128.6, and 131.6 µL L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for seedling root growth, germination, and shoot growth of &lt;i&gt;L. sativa&lt;/i&gt;, respectively, while it had IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values of 134.8, 145.7, and 147.9 µL L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively, for &lt;i&gt;P. harmala&lt;/i&gt;. Therefore, this EO could be used as a bioherbicide against weeds, while further study is recommended for the characterization of the authentic materials of the main compounds in the EO as well as for the evaluation of potency of this oil on a field scale and the determination of its biosafety.">

The essential oil was separated by hydrodistillation, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to identify its constituents. A total of twenty-seven compounds was identified from the EO, and its major components were 1-octanol (42.217%), geraniol (19.914%), and 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-ol (13.151%). Solvent extraction and fractionation were applied for preparing the ethanol extract (crude extract, CE), petroleum ether extract (PE), ethyl acetate extract (EE), &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-butanol extract (BE), and water extract (WE). The CE, EE and BE were abundant in phenols and flavonoids, and EE had the highest total phenol and total flavonoid contents. Gallic acid, ethyl gallate, rosavin and herbacetin were identified in the EE. The antibacterial activity results showed that the EO exhibited moderate inhibitory activity to the typical clinic bacteria, and EE exhibited the strongest antibacterial activity among the five extracts. For the compounds, ethyl gallate showed the strongest inhibitory activity to the test bacteria, and its minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) value for all the tested bacteria was 0.24 mg/mL and 0.48 mg/mL, respectively. The results of antioxidant activity showed that both CE and EE exhibited strong antioxidant activities in the DPPH radical scavenging and Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; reducing power tests, however, EO showed relatively weaker antioxidant ability. Ethyl gallate and rosavin exhibited excellent activity in the DPPH radical scavenging assay, and their IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value was 5.3 µg/mL and 5.9 µg/mL, respectively. Rosavin showed better reduction power activity than the other three compounds. These results could provide more evidence for the traditional use of &lt;i&gt;R. crenulata&lt;/i&gt;, and would be helpful for improving its application further.">

        <span class="abst" title="Human trichomoniasis, caused by the pathogenic parasitic protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis, is the most common non-viral sexually transmitted disease that contributes to reproductive morbidity in affected women and possibly to prostate cancer in men. Tritrichomonas foetus strains cause the disease trichomoniasis in farm animals (cattle, bulls, pigs) and diarrhea in domestic animals (cats and dogs). Because some T. vaginalis strains have become resistant to the widely used drug metronidazole, there is a need to develop alternative treatments, based on safe natural products that have the potential to replace and/or enhance the activity of lower doses of metronidazole. To help meet this need, this overview collates and interprets worldwide reported studies on the efficacy of structurally different classes of food, marine, and medicinal plant extracts and some of their bioactive pure compounds against T. vaginalis and T. foetus in vitro and in infected mice and women. Active food extracts include potato peels and their glycoalkaloids α-chaconine and α-solanine, caffeic and chlorogenic acids, and quercetin; the tomato glycoalkaloid α-tomatine; theaflavin-rich black tea extracts and bioactive theaflavins; plant essential oils and their compounds (+)-α-bisabolol and eugenol; the grape skin compound resveratrol; the kidney bean lectin, marine extracts from algae, seaweeds, and fungi and compounds that are derived from fungi; medicinal extracts and about 30 isolated pure compounds. Also covered are the inactivation of drug-resistant T. vaginalis and T. foetus strains by sensitized light; anti-trichomonad effects in mice and women; beneficial effects of probiotics in women; and mechanisms that govern cell death. The summarized findings will hopefully stimulate additional research, including molecular-mechanism-guided inactivations and human clinical studies, that will help ameliorate adverse effects of pathogenic protozoa.">

        <span class="abst" title="Rosemary (&lt;i&gt;Rosmarinus officinalis&lt;/i&gt; L.) is an evergreen bushy shrub which grows along the Mediterranean Sea, and sub-Himalayan areas. In folk medicine, it has been used as an antispasmodic, mild analgesic, to cure intercostal neuralgia, headaches, migraine, insomnia emotional upset, and depression. Different investigations have highlighted rosemary neuropharmacological properties as their main topics. Rosemary has significant antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-apoptotic, anti-tumorigenic, antinociceptive, and neuroprotective properties. Furthermore, it shows important clinical effects on mood, learning, memory, pain, anxiety, and sleep. The aim of the current work is to review the potential neuropharmacological effects of different rosemary extracts and its active constituents on nervous system disorders, their relevant mechanisms and its preclinical application to recall the therapeutic potential of this herb and more directions of future research projects. The data were gathered by searching the English articles in PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science. The keywords used as search terms were '&lt;i&gt;Rosmarinus officinalis&lt;/i&gt;', 'rosemary', 'nervous system', 'depression', 'memory', 'Alzheimer's disease' 'epilepsy', 'addiction', 'neuropathic pain', and 'disorders'. All kinds of related articles, abstracts and books were included. No time limitation was considered. Both &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; studies were subjected to this investigation. This review authenticates that rosemary has appeared as a worthy source for curing inflammation, analgesic, anti-anxiety, and memory boosting. It also arranges new perception for further investigations on isolated constituents, especially carnosic acid, rosmarinic acid, and essential oil to find exquisite therapeutics and support drug discovery with fewer side effects to help people suffering from nervous system disorders.">

        <span class="abst" title="A method that delivers a high yield and excellent quality of essential oil, which retains most of its value-added compounds, and undergoes least change after the extraction process, is greatly sought after. Although chemical free methods are acceptable, they call for an extensive processing time, while the yield and quality from these methods are often disappointing. This work utilizes subcritical water technology to address these issues. In this undertaking, essential oil was extracted from &lt;i&gt;Aquilaria malaccensis&lt;/i&gt; wood by way of subcritical conditions, and characterized through gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS). Optimization through response surface methodology revealed temperature to be the most critical factor for the extraction process, while the optimum conditions for temperature, sample-to-solvent ratio, and time for subcritical water extraction was revealed as 225 °C, 0.2 gr/mL, and 17 min, respectively. The subcritical water extraction technique involves two simultaneous processes, which are based on good fitting to the two-site kinetic and second order model. In comparison to the hydrodistillation method, GC/MS results indicated that the quality of &lt;i&gt;A. malaccensis&lt;/i&gt;' wood oils, derived through the subcritical water technique, are of significantly better quality, while containing many constructive value-added compounds, such as furfural and guaiacol, which are useful for the production of pesticides and medicines. Pore size, functional groups, and morphology analysis revealed the occurrence of substantial damage to the samples, which facilitated an improved extraction of bio-products. In comparison to conventional methods, the use of the subcritical method not only involves a shorter processing time, but also delivers a higher oil yield and quality.">

        <span class="abst" title="Asarum heterotropoides Fr. var. mandshuricum (Maxim) Kitag (Chinese wild ginger) is an important medicinal herb. Essential oil extracted from its roots is the key ingredient and is mainly composed of phenylpropanoid compounds. As a skiophyte plant, light is a crucial factor for A. heterotropoides var. mandshuricum growth and metabolism. To investigate the effects of light irradiation on the essential oil biosynthesis in A. heterotropoides var. mandshuricum, the plants were cultivated in four light irradiation treatments (100, 50, 24 and 12% full sunlight). The photosynthetic capacity, essential oil content and composition, activities of several enzymes and levels of some secondary metabolites involved in the shikimic acid and cinnamic acid pathways were analyzed. The leaf mass per area, average diurnal net photosynthetic rate, and the essential oil content increased significantly with increasing light intensity. Phenylalanine, cinnamic acid, and p-coumaric acid in the cinnamic acid pathway were at their highest levels in plants cultivated in 100% full sunlight. The highest content of shikimic acid in the shikimic acid pathway was obtained in plants grown in 50% sunlight transmittance. The activity of the enzymes 3-Deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase, phenylalanine ammonia lyase, cinnamate-4-hydroxylase and 4-coumarate:CoA ligase increased proportionally with light intensity. Overall, we conclude that high light irradiation promotes high net photosynthetic rate, high activity of enzymes and high amounts of phenylpropanoid precursor metabolites leading to significant biosynthesis of essential oil in A. heterotropoides var. mandshuricum.">

Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined using clinical and laboratory standards institute (CLSI) M27-A3 broth microdilution. Effect of EO on initial adhesion was quantified using XTT assay after allowing Candida cells to adhere to the polystyrene surface for 2 h. Biofilm formation of Candida in the presence of EO was quantified using XTT viability assay. Efficacy on reduction of germ tube formation was evaluated using standard protocol. Visualisation of biofilm formation and progression under the EO treatment were done using scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Time lapses microscope respectively. In-vivo toxicity of EO was determined using Galleria mellonella larvae. Chlorhexidine digluconate: positive control.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Eugenol was the main compound of EO. MIC was 1.0 mg/mL. 50% reduction in initial adhesion was achieved by C. albicans, C. tropicalis and C. dubliniensis with 1.0, &gt; 2.0 and 0.34 mg/mL respectively. 0.5 and 1.0 mg/mL significantly inhibit the germ tube formation. MBIC50 for forming biofilms were ≤ 0.35 mg/mL. 1.0 mg/mL prevent biofilm progression of Candida. SEM images exhibited cell wall damages, cellular shrinkages and decreased hyphal formation. No lethal effect was noted with in-vivo experiment model at any concentration tested.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;C. verum leaf oil acts against virulence factors of Candida and does not show any toxicity.">

Among the communities of coconut breakers women, babassu oil is used in culinary, as fuel, and mostly as medicinal oil for the treatment of skin wounds and inflammation. This study aimed to evaluate in vitro and in vivo the wound healing effects of babassu oil. In vitro, babassu oil increased the migration of L929 fibroblasts, inhibited the production of nitric oxide by LPS-stimulated peritoneal macrophages, and increased the levels of INF-&lt;i&gt;γ&lt;/i&gt; and IL-6 cytokines production. In vivo, babassu oil accelerated the healing process in a full-thickness splinted wound model, by an increase in the fibroblasts number, blood vessels, and collagen deposition in the wounds. The babassu oil also increased the recruitment of inflammatory cells into the wound site and showed an anti-inflammatory effect in a chronic ear edema model, reducing ear thickness, epidermal hyperplasia, and myeloperoxidase activity. Thus, these data corroborate the use of babassu oil in folk medicine as a remedy to treat skin wounds.">

This study aims to discuss the in vitro/in vivo scolicidal efficacy of different medicinal plants and their components used against Echinococcus granulosus. Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, PubMed and Scopus were used to retrieve the published literature from 2000-2020. A total of 62 published articles met the eligibility criteria and were reviewed. A total of 52 plant species belonging to 22 families have been reported to be evaluated as scolicidal agents against E. granulosus worldwide. Most extensively used medicinal plants against E. granulosus belong to the family Lamiaceae (25.0%) followed by Apiaceae (11.3%). Among various plant parts, leaves (36.0%) were most commonly used. Essential oils of Zataria multiflora and Ferula asafetida at a concentration of 0.02, and 0.06 mg/ml showed 100% in vitro scolicidal activity after 10 min post application, respectively. Z. multiflora also depicted high in vivo efficacy by decreasing weight and size while also causing extensive damage to the germinal layer of the cysts. Plant-based compounds like berberine, thymol, and thymoquinone have shown high efficacy against E. granulosus. These plant species and compounds could be potentially used for the development of an effective drug against E. granulosus, if further investigated for in vivo efficacy, toxicity, and mechanism of drug action in future research.">

Eighty male golden hamsters were randomly divided into 10 groups and received low or high dose of bergamot and sweet orange juice and essential oil, physiological saline, and positive drugs for four weeks, respectively. Results showed that all interventions could improve acne vulgaris by reducing the growth rate of sebaceous gland spots, inhibiting TG accumulation, decreasing the release of inflammatory cytokines (notably reducing IL-1&lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt; levels), promoting apoptosis in the sebaceous gland, and decreasing the ratio of T/E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

In this review, eleven widely consumed herbal infusions were evaluated for their antioxidant capacities, anticancer potential and possible toxicity. These herbal infusions are highly popular and consumed as daily drinks in different countries. Studies discussed in this review will provide a solid ground for researchers to have better understanding of the use of herbal infusions to reduce oxidative stress and as protective supplements against cancer development.">

The HPLC analysis indicated that &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;harmala&lt;/i&gt; seed oil exhibited a very high level of tocopherol contents, with values in the range of 2385.66-2722.68 mg/100 g. The most abundant tocopherol isomer was δ-tocopherol (90.39%), followed by γ-tocopherol (8.08%) and α-tocopherol (1.14%). We discovered for the first time the presence of tocotrenols in &lt;i&gt;P. harmala&lt;/i&gt; seed oils of the six populations studied. The GC-MS analyses revealed that linoleic acid was the main fatty acid (65.17%), followed by oleic acid (23.12%), palmitic acid (5.36%) and stearic acid (3.08%). We also studied the antifungal activity of seed oil of the Medenine (MD) population on ten fungal pathogens. The antifungal effects differed among pathogens and depended on oil concentrations. Seed oil of the MD population caused a significant decrease in mycelial growth of all fungi tested, with values ranging 31.50-82.11%, except for &lt;i&gt;Alternaria&lt;/i&gt; sp., which showed no inhibition. The antifungal activity against the 10 selected fungi can be explained by the richness in tocols of the extracted oil and make &lt;i&gt;P. harmala&lt;/i&gt; a promising crop for biological control. Furthermore, the importance of fatty acids and the wide geographic spread in Tunisia of this species make this crop a potential source of renewable energy.">

The use of HPH led to qualitative and quantitative differences between the volatile profiles of the HD and the nanoemulsion of &lt;i&gt;S. satureioides&lt;/i&gt; essential oil. Whereas borneol, α-terpineol, and thymol were the predominant constituents in the HD oil, carvacrol, thymol, and γ-terpinene were the major constituents in the nanoemulsion. The antioxidant activity of the &lt;i&gt;S. satureioides&lt;/i&gt; essential oil nanoemulsion displayed was lower as compared to that of HD oil using DPPH free radical-scavenging, CUPRAC, and ABTS assays. This is consistent with the differences in total flavonoid, total phenolic, and volatiles detected in both HD oil and its nanoemulsion. Meanwhile, the cytotoxicity on liver cancer cells (Hep-G2) was stronger using nanoemulsions (106 μg/mL) than using HD oil (274.8 μg/mL).">

The total phenolic and flavonoid contents and phenolic compounds profile analyzed spectrophotometrically and by high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC), respectively, were evaluated in the developed tinctures. The results showed that the tinctures prepared from the &lt;i&gt;S. montana&lt;/i&gt; herb by maceration or remaceration are rich in polyphenols, and there is an influence of the technological factors (particle size and extraction mode) on the total phenolic and flavonoid contents.

However, enzyme-assisted reflux extraction pretreatment did not significantly outperform reflux extraction (no-enzyme control), suggesting that the observed yield increase was mostly a consequence of reflux extraction and enzymatic activity had only a minute effect.

In the present study, we therefore evaluated these effects of tangerine essential oil by measurement of electroencephalography (EEG) activity with 32 channel platforms according to the international 10-20 system in 10 male and 10 female subjects. Then the sleep onset latency was studied to further confirm the effect on sleep activity. The results revealed that different concentrations, subthreshold to suprathreshold, of tangerine oil gave different brain responses. Undiluted tangerine oil inhalation reduced slow and fast alpha wave powers and elevated low and mid beta wave powers. The subthreshold and threshold dilution showed the opposite effect to the brain compared with suprathreshold concentration. Inhalation of threshold concentration showed effectively decreased alpha and beta wave powers and increased theta wave power, which emphasize its sedative effect. The reduction of sleep onset latency was confirmed with the implementation of the observed sedative effect of tangerine oil.">

        <span class="abst" title="(1) Background: The COVID-19 pandemic and the imposition of strict but necessary measures to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus have been, and still are, major stress factors for adults, children, and adolescents. Stress harms human health as it creates free radicals in the human body. According to various recent studies, volatile oils from various aromatic plants have a high content of antioxidants and antimicrobial compounds. An external supply of antioxidants is required to destroy these free radicals. The main purpose of this paper is to create a yoghurt with high antioxidant capacity, using only raw materials from Romania; (2) Methods: The bioactive components used to enrich the cow milk yoghurt were extracted as volatile oils out of four aromatic plants: basil, mint, lavender and fennel. Initially, the compounds were extracted to determine the antioxidant capacity, and subsequently, the antioxidant activity of the yoghurt was determined. The 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhy-drazyl (DPPH) method was used to determine the antioxidant activity; (3) Results: The results show that cow milk yoghurt enhanced with volatile oils of basil, lavender, mint and fennel, encapsulated in sodium alginate has an antioxidant and antimicrobial effect as a staple food with multiple effects in increasing the body's immunity. The antioxidant activity proved to be considerably higher than the control sample. The highest antioxidant activity was obtained on the first day of the analysis, decreasing onwards to measurements taken on days 10 and 20. The cow milk yoghurt enriched with volatile basil oil obtained the best results; (4) Conclusions: The paper shows that yoghurts with a high antioxidant capacity were obtained, using only raw materials from Romania. A healthy diet, compliance with safety conditions and finding appropriate and safe methods to increase the body's immunity is a good alternative to a major transition through harder times, such as pandemics. The creation of food products that include natural antioxidant compounds combines both the current great possibility of developing food production in Romania and the prevention and reduction of the effects caused by pandemic stress in the human body.">

Rausch.) are aromatic plants with considerable economic value. These plants and their essential oils are used in medicine, cosmetics, and the food industry. One of the main limiting factors in peppermint and chamomile commercial cultivation is weed competition since weeds are able to decrease both oil amount and biomass yield. The purpose of the present study was to determine the effect of parasitism by field dodder (&lt;i&gt;Cuscuta campestris&lt;/i&gt; Yunck.) on peppermint and chamomile dry weight and their essential oil yield and composition. Essential oils from both noninfested and infested peppermint and chamomile plants were obtained by hydrodistillation and characterized chemically by gas chromatography (GC) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS). The amount of dry matter accumulated by peppermint and chamomile plants infested by field dodder was lower (25% and 63%, respectively) compared to noninfested plants. Essential oil yield increased for peppermint (3.87% (&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;w&lt;/i&gt;) and 3.63% (&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;w&lt;/i&gt;)), but decreased for chamomile (0.2% (&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;w&lt;/i&gt;) and 0.5% (&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;w&lt;/i&gt;)) both from infested and noninfested plants, respectively. The oil composition profile significantly differed in terms of content. In peppermint plants, field dodder infestation increased menthone content by 23%, and decreased the content of both menthol by 11% and pulegone by 67%. Furthermore, δ-cadinene was detected only in oil extracted from infested peppermint plants. Compared to peppermint, chamomile plants were significantly more affected by field dodder in terms of essential oil yield, as well as oil composition and plant dry weight. In chamomile plants, (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-dendrolasin was detected in the oil of noninfested plants, and 1,4-dimethyl-7-(1-methylethyl)-azulen-2-ol was detected only in the oil of infested plants.">

To our best knowledge, there are few studies on oregano grown in the arid Andes region, but none on the metabolites produced and their bioactivity. This work identified fifty metabolites by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS)-monoterpene hydrocarbons, oxygenated monoterpenes, phenolic monoterpenes, sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, and oxygenated sesquiterpenes-present in the essential oil of oregano collected in the Atacama Desert. The main components of essential oregano oil were thymol (15.9%), &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-sabinene hydrate (13.4%), γ-terpinene (10.6%), &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-cymene (8.6%), linalyl acetate (7.2%), sabinene (6.5%), and carvacrol methyl ether (5.6%). The antibacterial tests showed that the pathogenic bacteria &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Salmonella enterica&lt;/i&gt; and the phytopathogenic bacteria &lt;i&gt;Erwinia rhapontici&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Xanthomonas campestris&lt;/i&gt; were the most susceptible to oregano oil, with the lowest concentrations of oil necessary to inhibit their bacterial growth. Moreover, oregano oil showed antibacterial activity against bacteria associated with food poisoning. In conclusion, &lt;i&gt;O. vulgare&lt;/i&gt; from the arid Andean region possesses an important antibacterial activity with a high potential in the food industry and agriculture.">

        <span class="abst" title="Thymus albicans is an endemic species of the Iberian Peninsula with a vulnerable conservation status. In an attempt to contribute to the valorization of this species, the present study brings new insights on the antifungal and anti-inflammatory mechanism of action of T. albicans essential oil. The antifungal activity of the oil and its major compounds was assessed for the first time against standard and clinically isolated strains of yeasts and filamentous fungi. The effect on the two major virulence factors of Candida albicans (germ tube formation and biofilm disruption) was considered in more detail. At 0.08 μL/mL, the oil inhibited C. albicans germ tube formation by more than 40% and decreased biofilm biomass at MIC values, thus pointing out its antivirulent potential. The anti-inflammatory activity of the essential oil was investigated on LPS-stimulated mouse macrophages (RAW 264.7) by evaluating the levels of several pro-inflammatory mediators, namely nitric oxide (NO), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). T. albicans oil reduced the production of nitrites, a NO derived sub-product, at non-cytotoxic concentrations of 0.32 and 0.64 μL/mL, by 27 and 41%, respectively. In addition, the iNOS protein levels of essential oil pre-treated cells were reduced by 14%. Overall, the high essential oil yield of T. albicans as well as its bioactive effects at concentrations without cytotoxicity, encourage further studies on the potential pharmacological applications of this species. Furthermore, these results raise awareness for the need to preserve endangered species that may hold relevant medicinal value.">

CKEO, in comparison to its major constituent, geraniol, showed better MICs against tested pathogens. In combination studies, the effective concentrations of CKEO and streptomycin were reduced from 20 to 5 μg/mL and 11 to 0.7 ng/mL against E. coli. This suggests their synergistic action. However, CKEO showed partial synergy with ciprofloxacin. To understand the efficacy of CKEO, time-kill kinetics was performed. CKEO took the half time to show the bactericidal effect in comparison to streptomycin at their 2x MICs (double the MIC), while their combination took only 30 min for this. Fluorescence and surface electron microscopic and protein estimation studies suggested the multi-target action of CKEO-streptomycin combination against E. coli. Further, CKEO alone/in combination exhibited less than 10% haemolytic activity at its MIC.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;These results indicate that CKEO is a potentially safe alternative for the treatment of various pathogenic bacterial strains. It could be used for a variety of applications including human health, food storage, aquaculture, etc.">

To explore their potential, it is important to bring these remedies out of historical treatises, and into present-day scientific evaluation. Using an example of Indian traditional medicine (Ayurveda), we present a perspective toward evaluating historical remedies for anti-biofilm potential. Across compendia, we identified three plant-based remedies (of &lt;i&gt;Kalanchoe pinnata&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Cynodon dactylon&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Ocimum tenuiflorum&lt;/i&gt;) recommended for wounds. The remedies were reconstituted in accordance with historical practices, and tested for their effects on biofilm formation and eradication assays of wound pathogens, &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;. Based on our approach and the results obtained, we provide insights into the considerations and challenges related to identifying potential remedies in historical texts, and testing them in the laboratory with standard biofilm assays. We believe this will be relevant for future studies exploring anti-biofilm approaches at the interface of historical medicine and present-day scientific practices.">

Flower (MEO&lt;sub&gt;Fl&lt;/sub&gt;) and leaf (MEO&lt;sub&gt;Lv&lt;/sub&gt;) essential oils were comprised mainly of monoterpenes (43.1% and 21.1%) and oxygenated monoterpenes (54.8% and 77.7%), respectively, with a high abundance of monoterpene hydrocarbons, including &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-cymene, γ-terpinene, α-terpinene, and α-thujene. Major oxygenated monoterpenes of MEO&lt;sub&gt;Fl&lt;/sub&gt; and MEO&lt;sub&gt;Lv&lt;/sub&gt; included carvacrol and thymol. Both MEO&lt;sub&gt;Fl&lt;/sub&gt; and MEO&lt;sub&gt;Lv&lt;/sub&gt; stimulated a transient increase in intracellular free Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration ([Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) in TRPA1 but not in TRPV1 or TRPV4-transfected cells, with MEO&lt;sub&gt;Lv&lt;/sub&gt; being much more effective than MEO&lt;sub&gt;Fl&lt;/sub&gt;. Furthermore, the pure monoterpenes carvacrol, thymol, and β-myrcene activated TRPA1 but not the TRPV1 or TRPV4 channels, suggesting that these compounds represented the TRPA1-activating components of &lt;i&gt;M. fistulosa&lt;/i&gt; essential oils. The transient increase in [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; induced by MEO&lt;sub&gt;Fl&lt;/sub&gt;/MEO&lt;sub&gt;Lv&lt;/sub&gt;, carvacrol, β-myrcene, and thymol in TRPA1-transfected cells was blocked by a selective TRPA1 antagonist, HC-030031. Although carvacrol and thymol have been reported previously to activate the TRPA1 channels, this is the first report to show that β-myrcene is also a TRPA1 channel agonist. Finally, molecular modeling studies showed a substantial similarity between the docking poses of carvacrol, thymol, and β-myrcene in the binding site of human TRPA1. Thus, our results provide a cellular and molecular basis to explain at least part of the therapeutic properties of these essential oils, laying the foundation for prospective pharmacological studies involving TRP ion channels.">

The results obtained were assessed by principal component analysis (PCA). PCA distinguished six groups characterized by different terpene chemotypes. Amongst the EOs studied, the clove EO showed the strongest antioxidant activity characterized by an EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of 0.36 µL/mL. The oregano EO had the greatest antiyeast activity characterized by a minimal inhibitory concentration of 10 µL/mL. In conclusion, clove and oregano EOs are strong antifungal and antioxidant agents, respectively, with great potential in the food industry to avoid spoilage and to increase shelf life.">

        <span class="abst" title="Plants are considered green resources for thousands of bioactive compounds. Essential oils (EOs) are an important class of secondary compounds with various biological activities, including allelopathic and antimicrobial activities. Herein, the present study aimed to compare the chemical profiles of the EOs of the widely distributed medicinal plant &lt;i&gt;Calotropis procera&lt;/i&gt; collected from Saudi Arabia and Egypt. In addition, this study also aimed to assess their allelopathic and antimicrobial activities. The EOs from Egyptian and Saudi ecospecies were extracted by hydrodistillation and analyzed via GC-MS. The correlation between the analyzed EOs and those published from Egypt, India, and Nigeria was assessed by principal component analysis (PCA) and agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC). The allelopathic activity of the extracted EOs was tested against two weeds (&lt;i&gt;Bidens pilosa&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Dactyloctenium aegyptium&lt;/i&gt;). Moreover, the EOs were tested for antimicrobial activity against seven bacterial and two fungal strains. Ninety compounds were identified from both ecospecies, where 76 compounds were recorded in Saudi ecospecies and 33 in the Egyptian one. Terpenes were recorded as the main components along with hydrocarbons, aromatics, and carotenoids. The sesquiterpenes (54.07%) were the most abundant component of EO of the Saudi sample, while the diterpenes (44.82%) represented the mains of the Egyptian one. Hinesol (13.50%), &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-chrysanthenyl acetate (12.33%), 1,4-&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-1,7-&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-acorenone (7.62%), phytol (8.73%), and myristicin (6.13%) were found as the major constituents of EO of the Saudi sample, while phytol (38.02%), &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-docosane (6.86%), linoleic acid (6.36%), &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-pentacosane (6.31%), and bicyclogermacrene (4.37%) represented the main compounds of the Egyptian one. It was evident that the EOs of both ecospecies had potent phytotoxic activity against the two tested weeds, while the EO of the Egyptian ecospecies was more effective, particularly on the weed &lt;i&gt;D. aegyptium&lt;/i&gt;. Moreover, the EOs showed substantial antibacterial and antifungal activities. The present study revealed that the EOs of Egyptian and Saudi ecospecies were different in quality and quantity, which could be attributed to the variant environmental and climatic conditions. The EOs of both ecospecies showed significant allelopathic and antimicrobial activity; therefore, these EOs could be considered as potential green eco-friendly resources for weed and microbe control, considering that this plant is widely grown in arid habitats.">

In the present experiment, the aerial parts of this plant were harvested at up to six different developmental stages during the growing season to determine the phytochemical profiles. Our results indicated that the highest essential oil content was obtained in the mid-mature seed stage (3.5%). The most elevated extract content was recorded in the floral budding stage (10.4%). In the vegetative stage, limonene (18.1%), in floral budding stage, caryophyllene (14.1%), anethole (14.6%), and β-bisabolene (12.7%), in the full flowering stage, myristicin (15.0%), and hexyl butyrate (9.1%), in the early development of seeds stage, hexyl butyrate (32.1%), and octyl acetate (11.7%), in the mid-mature seeds stage hexyl butyrate (38.8%), octyl acetate (14.5%), in the late-mature/ripe seeds stage, hexyl butyrate (23.6%), and octyl acetate (10.5%) are recorded as the main components. The highest phenolic acids content was obtained in the floral budding stage (287.40 mg/g dried extract). The analysis of phenolic acids demonstrated cinnamic acid (8.0-225.3 mg/g extract), p-coumaric acid (1.7-39.2 mg/g extract), p-hydroxybenzoic acid (0.8-16.8 mg/g extract), and ferulic acid (2.4-15.8 mg/g extract) as the main phenolic acids. Cinnamic acid was found as the major phenolic compound in the vegetative stage following by floral budding, the full flowering stage, the early development of seeds, and late-mature/ripe seeds stages. P-coumaric acid was the most abundant phenolic compounds in the mid-mature seeds stage. In this regard, the harvest time of &lt;i&gt;H. persicum&lt;/i&gt; aerial parts can be selected to achieve the highest secondary metabolites of interest. The results of this study can be used as a guideline for grower to obtain the highest possible amount of desirable metabolites, beneficial in both food and pharmaceutical industries as well as their undeniable economical benefits.">

        <span class="abst" title="The roots, bark, and leaves of &lt;i&gt;Cinnamomum camphora&lt;/i&gt; are rich in essential oils, which mainly comprised monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. Although the essential oils obtained from &lt;i&gt;C. camphora&lt;/i&gt; have been widely used in pharmaceutical, medicinal, perfume, and food industries, the molecular mechanisms underlying terpenoid biosynthesis are poorly understood. To address this lack of knowledge, we performed transcriptome analysis to investigate the key regulatory genes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis in &lt;i&gt;C. camphora&lt;/i&gt;. High-oil-yield trees of linalool type and low-oil-yield trees were used to assemble a &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; transcriptome of &lt;i&gt;C. camphora&lt;/i&gt;. A total of 121,285 unigenes were assembled, and the total length, average length, N50, and GC content of unigenes were 87,869,987, 724, 1,063, and 41.1%, respectively. Comparison of the transcriptome profiles of linalool-type &lt;i&gt;C. camphora&lt;/i&gt; with trees of low oil yield resulted in a total of 3,689 differentially expressed unigenes, among them 31 candidate genes had annotations associated with metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides, including four in the monoterpenoid biosynthesis pathway and three in the terpenoid backbone biosynthesis pathway. Collectively, this genome-wide transcriptome provides a valuable tool for future identification of genes related to essential oil biosynthesis. Additionally, the identification of a cohort of genes in the biosynthetic pathways of terpenoids provides a theoretical basis for metabolic engineering of essential oils in &lt;i&gt;C. camphora&lt;/i&gt;.">

The elucidated factors affecting the composition of Mentha essential oils are fertilization, drying conditions, mechanical impedance, NaCl stress, and Gamma irradiation. Investigation of the activities of the Mentha species showed that the main interest was dedicated to addressing the antibacterial effect towards gram+ and gram- bacteria. Essential oils of Mentha species exhibited antifungal, antiviral, antioxidant, insecticidal, licidal, niticidal, allelopathic, antidiabetic, derma-protective, and anticorrosive activities. The ethnobotanical surveys revealed that Mentha species are used in seven regions: Tafilalet, High Atlas, Fez-Boulemane, Taounat, Oujda, Ouazzane, and Rabat. By calculating the Jaccard index, the highest degree of similarity was found between Tafilalet, Rabat, and Oujda regions. The wide use of the Mentha species in Morocco highlights the high ethnobotanical value of the genus.">

        <span class="abst" title="Plastic, usually derived from non-renewable sources, is among the most used materials in food packaging. Despite its barrier properties, plastic packaging has a recycling rate below the ideal and its accumulation in the environment leads to environmental issues. One of the solutions approached to minimize this impact is the development of food packaging materials made from polymers from renewable sources that, in addition to being biodegradable, can also be edible. Different biopolymers from agricultural renewable sources such as gelatin, whey protein, starch, chitosan, alginate and pectin, among other, have been analyzed for the development of biodegradable films. Moreover, these films can serve as vehicles for transporting bioactive compounds, extending their applicability as bioactive, edible, compostable and biodegradable films. Biopolymer films incorporated with plant-derived bioactive compounds have become an interesting area of research. The interaction between environment-friendly biopolymers and bioactive compounds improves functionality. In addition to interfering with thermal, mechanical and barrier properties of films, depending on the properties of the bioactive compounds, new characteristics are attributed to films, such as antimicrobial and antioxidant properties, color and innovative flavors. This review compiles information on agro-based biopolymers and plant-derived bioactive compounds used in the production of bioactive films. Particular emphasis has been given to the methods used for incorporating bioactive compounds from plant-derived into films and their influence on the functional properties of biopolymer films. Some limitations to be overcome for future advances are also briefly summarized. This review will benefit future prospects for exploring innovative methods of incorporating plant-derived bioactive compounds into films made from agricultural polymers.">

Given the rise in resistance to conventional antibiotics, natural products have been targeted for the development of antimicrobials with novel mechanism of action. This review aimed to collate available evidence on the antimicrobial, anti-parasitic and anti-inflammatory activities of mānuka oil and its components. A comprehensive literature search of was conducted using PubMed and Embase (via Scopus) targeting articles from database inception until June 2020. Chemical structures and IUPAC names were sourced from PubChem. Unpublished information from grey literature databases, Google search, targeted websites and Google Patents were also included. The present review found extensive in vitro data supporting the antimicrobial effects of mānuka oil warrants further clinical studies to establish its therapeutic potential. Clinical evidence on its efficacy, safety and dosing guidelines are necessary for its implementation for medical purposes. Further work on regulation, standardization and characterization of the medicinal properties of mānuka oil is required for establishing consistent efficacy of the product.">

Spatial memory was assessed using the Y-maze test and novel object recognition test (NOR). Anxiety and depression were measured in the novel tank diving test (NTT). Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis was used to study the phytochemical composition of TEO. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and oxidative stress response in the brain of zebrafish were determined. TEO ameliorated Sco-induced increasing of AChE activity, amnesia, anxiety, and reduced the brain antioxidant capacity. These results suggest that TEO may have preventive and/or therapeutic potentials in the management of memory deficits and brain oxidative stress in zebrafish with amnesia.">

Using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS), the principal components were methyleugenol (41.31%) and eugenol (33.95%), followed by (E)-caryophyllene (5.65%), &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-cymene-8-ol (3.50%), 1,8-cineole (2.94%), and α-terpinolene (1.41%). Results showed similar scavenging activity via 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl DPPH radical scavenging activity (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 110.00 ± 0.08 μg/mL), as well as very potent antioxidant activity against both ferric reducing/antioxidant power (FRAP) (106.00 ± 0.11 μg/mL) and β-carotene bleaching (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 315.00 ± 2.08 μg/mL) assays when compared to positive butylated hydroxytoluene and ascorbic acid. The molecular docking approach has also been performed to screen the antioxidant activities of the major and potent compounds against human protein target peroxiredoxin 5. Results showed good binding profiles and attributed the strongest inhibitory activity to β-caryophyllene oxide (-5.8 kcal/mol), followed respectively by isocembrol and α-selinene (-5.4 kcal/mol), and viridiflorol (-5.1 kcal/mol). Furthermore, ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion)-related physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties have been assessed and support our in vitro findings.

Greek oregano was distinguished by visibly higher number of glandular trichomes on the leaves (up to 4.85 per 1 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) followed by higher content of essential oil in the herb (up to 3.36 g × 100 g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; DW) in comparison to common oregano. Based on the essential oil composition, Greek oregano was classified as mixed carvacrol/γ-terpinene chemotype, while common oregano as mixed sabinyl/cymyl type rich in sesquiterpenes. Greek oregano was also characterized by higher total content of phenolic acids (up to 6.16 g × 100 g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; DW) and rosmarinic acid (up to 6787.2 mg × 100 g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; DW) than common oregano. Essential oil content reached the maximum at the beginning of blooming (common oregano) and at the full blooming stage (Greek oregano). In turn, the amount of phenolic acids followed by rosmarinic acid was the highest at the beginning of seed-setting stage, in the case of both subspecies. The differences between subspecies concerning chemical composition (especially essential oil) were reflected in the sensory attributes, where both odor and taste notes were found at higher level for Greek oregano. Results of our work indicate that Greek oregano is well adapted to grow in the temperate zone conditions. Such adaptation was reflected mainly in the satisfied yield and maintaining characters typical for the Mediterranean plant, e.g., a high essential oil content followed by high carvacrol share, traits the most important from practice viewpoint.">

The essential oils were successfully screened and confirmed by HRLC-MS analysis. The anti-bacterial ability of the compounds were loaded into the chitosan nanoparticles and proved by FT-IR analysis. In addition, the chitosan loaded essential oils morphology was compared with chitosan alone in SEM analysis and suggested that the material was loaded successfully. Further, the anti-bacterial ability of the chitosan loaded essential oils were primarily confirmed by agar well diffusion method. At the 100 µg/mL of lowest concentration of chitosan loaded essential oils, the multi-drug resistant &lt;i&gt;K. pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; was inhibited with 96% and confirmed by minimum inhibition concentration experiment.

Phenol, flavonoid, and anthocyanin contents were examined before and after using column. Antioxidant activities, DNA protection ability, xanthine oxidase inhibition, and cytotoxicity of this fraction were also determined. The use of Amberlite increased phenol, flavonoid, and anthocyanin contents in fraction compared to the sample before fractionation. The IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values of various antioxidant assays comprises 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl-hydrate (DPPH), ferric-reducing antioxidant power assay (FRAP), and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) which were 226.66 ± 1.25, 126.03 ± 0.11, and 241.43 ± 0.33 for waste water, and these values for fraction were 63.21 ± 0.90, 34.6 ± 0.17, and 50.59 ± 0.75 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/ml, respectively. The Trolox equivalent values of fraction in oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay were 0.34 ± 0.04, and the EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values in cellular antioxidant activity were 91.24 ± 0.32 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/ml.

In this study, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) has been recruited, as one of the deep learning techniques, to be used in classifying and predicting the biological activities of the essential oil-producing plant/s through their chemical compositions. The model is established based on the available chemical composition's information of a set of endemic Egyptian plants and their biological activities. Another type of machine learning algorithms, Multiclass Neural Network (MNN), has been applied on the same Essential Oils (EO) dataset. This aims to fairly evaluate the performance of the proposed CNN model. The recorded accuracy in the testing process for both CNN and MNN is 98.13% and 81.88%, respectively. Finally, the CNN technique has been adopted as a reliable model for classifying and predicting the bioactivities of the Egyptian EO-containing plants. The overall accuracy for the final prediction process is reported as approximately 97%. Hereby, the proposed deep learning model could be utilized as an efficient model in predicting the bioactivities of, at least Egyptian, EOs-producing plants.">

The results showed that the major chemical composition constituents of the investigated essential oil are γ-terpinene + α-terpinolene and carvacrol + p-cymene and the thermal behavior is dependent on the content. This composition drastically changes through the heating of the samples and causes significant changes in thermal behavior. The present study demonstrated that the concentration of carvacrol in S. hortensis essential oil is increasing after heating treatment, and the sample heated at 190 ºC for 2.5 h contained more than 91% carvacrol. This simple treatment is a rapid way to obtain carvacrol from the essential oil that has high potential as a natural preservative suitable for the food industry and alternative and complementary medicine.">

        <span class="abst" title="Today, food consumers prefer to use the foods that contain natural preservatives. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of Qodume Shirazi seed mucilage (QSSM) and lavender essential oil (LO) on the preservation of ostrich meat during cold storage. The chemical compounds of LO were identified through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The ostrich meat samples were coated with the mucilage containing the essential oil at concentrations of 0%, 0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, and 2%, v/v. The control and the coated ostrich meat samples were kept at 4°C and analyzed for microbiological (total viable count, psychrotrophic count, &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;, coliforms, and fungi), physicochemical (moisture content, pH, texture, and color parameters), and sensorial (odor, color, and total acceptance) characteristics during 9 days of storage. GC/MS identified 12 compounds in the essential oil, among which linalool was the major one (43.3%). The lightness (L* value) and hardness of all the ostrich meat samples were reduced during the storage. From a microbiological point of view, the cold storage duration for the control and the coated sample without the essential oil was only 3 days, while for coated samples containing 0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, and 2% essential oil, it was 3, 3, 6, and 9 days, respectively. The coated ostrich meat containing 2% LO had an appropriate quality with an expanded shelf life. The results showed that neural network with 10 neurons in the hidden layer had the lowest mean squared error and mean absolute error and the highest correlation coefficient for predicting the quality and microbial properties of the coated meat samples during storage.">

The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry characterization revealed that thymol (1.2%-86.4%), carvacrol (3.2%-52.4%), gamma-terpinene (0.0%-12.7%), para-cymene (3.2%-5.2%), geraniol (0.0%-14.5%), and spathulenol (0.0%-13.6%) are the major constituents of the essential oils. Gelatin-pectin composite incorporated with the essential oils exhibited acidic pH (2.40-3.04), low conductivity (265-278 µS/cm), low surface tension (19.0-23.5 mN/m), low Newtonian viscosity (23.7-28.5 mPa.s), negative zeta-potential (14.2-16.9 mV), and nanoscale particle size (313-336 nm). These rheological properties result in the production of globular gelatin-pectin nanoparticles with a size range of 500-700 nm. The FTIR spectra of gelatin-pectin and gelatin-pectin-essential oils to some extent were similar, suggesting the noncovalent interactions between them. Gelatin-pectin composite incorporated with the essential oils displayed antiglucose oxidation (130-150 µg/ml) antilipid peroxidation (120-130 µg/ml), antiprotein oxidation (150-168 µg/ml), and antiprotein glycation (145-170 µg/ml) as well as antiamylase (216-230 µg/ml), and antiglucosidase (212-238 µg/ml) activity.

        <span class="abst" title="A new coronavirus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged and with it, a global investigation of new antiviral treatments and supportive care for organ failure due to this life-threatening viral infection. Traditional Persian Medicine (TPM) is one of the most ancient medical doctrines mostly known with the manuscripts of Avicenna and Rhazes. In this paper, we first introduce a series of medicinal plants that would potentially be beneficial in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection according to TPM textbooks. Then, we review medicinal plants based on the pharmacological studies obtained from electronic databases and discuss their mechanism of action in SARS-CoV-2 infection. There are several medicinal plants in TPM with cardiotonic, kidney tonic, and pulmonary tonic activities, protecting the lung, heart, and kidney, the three main vulnerable organs in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Some medicinal plants can prevent &quot;humor infection&quot;, a situation described in TPM which has similar features to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pharmacological evaluations are in line with the therapeutic activities of several plants mentioned in TPM, mostly through antiviral, cytoprotective, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-apoptotic mechanisms. Amongst the primarily-introduced medicinal plants from TPM, rhubarb, licorice, garlic, saffron, galangal, and clove are the most studied plants and represent candidates for clinical studies. The antiviral compounds isolated from these plants provide novel molecular structures to design new semisynthetic antiviral agents. Future clinical studies in healthy volunteers as well as patients suffering from pulmonary infections are necessary to confirm the safety and efficacy of these plants as complementary and integrative interventions in SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

The antioxidant assays followed ORAC, FRAP and TEAC tests. The antimicrobial activities of the extract and purified flavonoid were analysed against six multi-drug resistant microbial strains in broth dilution assays.&lt;h4&gt;Result&lt;/h4&gt;The results revealed that both the crude extracts and isolated 6-methyltectochrysin exhibited positive radical ion scavenging antioxidant potential, however the crude extract was about 6-fold more potent antioxidant than the purified 6-methyltectochrysin. The crude extract also showed strong antimicrobial activities against &lt;i&gt;Bacillus cereus&lt;/i&gt;, and even more potent antimicrobial agent than the reference ampicillin antibiotic against &lt;i&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; subsp. &lt;i&gt;pneumoniae.&lt;/i&gt; A higher resistance was observed for the tested Gram-negative strains than for the Gram-positive ones. 6-methyltectochrysin was generally inactive in the antimicrobial assays.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;The crude methanolic extract showed significant bioactivity which validates the medicinal relevance of the plant. The observed biological activities, especially against a notorious strain of &lt;i&gt;B. cereus,&lt;/i&gt; suggest that &lt;i&gt;L. petersonii&lt;/i&gt; could be a promising natural source of food preservatives.">

Also, the synergistic/antagonistic effects, generated by the presence of the main chemical compounds, were studied in order to recommend a preparation with optimal antimicrobial activity. The obtained results underline the fact that the monocomponent emulsion ECEO shows antimicrobial activity, while EOEO and EBEO do not inhibit the development of the analyzed strains. In binary or tertiary emulsions E(BEO/CEO), E(CEO/OEO) and E(OEO/ BEO/CEO) the antimicrobial effect of clove oil is potentiated due to the synergism exerted by the chemical compounds of essential oils.">

Aiele resin had a higher yield (6.86%) of essential oil than Okoume (3.62%). Twenty-one compounds for Okoume and eighteen for Aiele essential oil were identified using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Gp-C-MS) technique. The main compounds identified in Okoume essential oil were benzenemethanol, α, α,4-trimethyl (28.85%), (+)-3-carene (3,7,7-trimethyl bicyclo[4.1.0]hept-3-ene) (17.93%), D-Limonene ((4R)-1-methyl-4-prop-1-en-2-ylcyclohexene) (19.36%). With regard to the Aiele essential oil, we identified (1R,4S)-1-methyl-4-propan-2-ylcyclohex-2-en-1-ol (26.64%), and 1-methyl-4-propan-2-ylcyclohex-2-en-1-ol (26.83%).

In comparison, the inhibition zone ranged from 6 to 12 mm for &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;. An electronic nose (e-nose) combined with pattern analysis methods such as principal component analysis (PCA), discriminant function analysis (DFA), and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) were used to discriminate the essential oil samples. In summary, the e-nose and GC-MS allowed the identification of bioactive compounds in the essential oil samples, which have a strong antimicrobial activity, with satisfactory results.">

In this work, the essential oils were extracted using hydrodistillation in Clevenger apparatus and analyzed by GC-MS to determine their composition. The antioxidant capacity (AC) was evaluated in vitro. The cytotoxicity was determined using cell line cultures both non tumoral and tumoral. The toxicity was determined using the nematode &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated against 52 bacteria using the agar disc diffusion method and the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined. The principal compounds found in &lt;i&gt;C. alba&lt;/i&gt; essential oil (CA_EO) were α-terpineol (24.96%) and eucalyptol (21.63%) and were isazafrol (91.9%) in &lt;i&gt;L. sempervirens&lt;/i&gt; essential oil (LS_EO).

        <span class="abst" title="Phthorimaea operculella (Zeller) is a worldwide pest of potato. Plant-borne chemicals would be potential alternatives of synthetic chemical fumigants against P. operculella in the storage. Asari Radix et Rhizoma is derived from the dry roots and rhizomes of Asarum heterotropoides Fr. Schmidt var. mandshuricum, A. sieboldii Miq. var. seoulense, or A. sieboldii. In this study, fumigant toxicity and oviposition deterrent of volatile constituents from ARR, δ-3-carene, γ-terpinene, terpinolene, eucarvone, 3,5-dimethoxytoluene, and methyleugenol were tested against P. operculella. The preliminary verification of preventive and control effects of eucarvone, 3,5-dimethoxytoluene and methyleugenol on P. operculella was carried out by simulating warehouse experiments. The results indicated that the six compounds above had fumigation toxic effects on the adults and eggs of P. operculella. Among them, δ-3-carene, γ-terpinene, and terpinolene had weaker fumigation effects than those of eucarvone, 3,5-dimethoxytoluene, and methyleugenol. The LC50 values of eucarvone, 3,5-dimethoxytoluene, and methyleugenol against adult P. operculella were 1.01, 1.78, 1.51 mg/liter air, respectively. The LC50 values against egg P. operculella were 1.09, 0.55, 0.30 mg/liter air, respectively. The oviposition deterrent experiment showed that only methyleugenol (at 5 and 1 mg/ml) and eucarvone (5 mg/ml) had a substantial oviposition deterrent effect. The simulated warehouse experiment verified that methyleugenol, eucarvone, and 3,5-dimethoxytoluene protected potatoes from P. operculella and demonstrated that methyleugenol had the best preventive and control effects. It was concluded that methyleugenol was the active ingredient with the most potential in the volatiles from ARR on P. operculella control and merit further study as botanic fumigant.">

After application of the exclusion criteria, 4,774 standardized cannabis oils were included, which belong to different medicinal cannabis varieties and prepared according to different extraction methods. The concentration of the principal cannabinoids was taken into account dividing samples on the basis of the main extraction procedures and cannabis varieties. According to this analysis, the most substantial variations should be attributed to different cannabis varieties rather than to their extraction protocols.

The cultivation of medicinal and aromatic plants (MAP) using bio-elicitors has been advocated as genuine tool to sustainably assure higher quantity and quality EOs. Herein, a field trial and laboratory bioassays were undergone to decipher the impact of a local arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) inoculation on agro-morphological yield, EO output and differential suppression of common bean (&lt;i&gt;Phaseolus vulgaris&lt;/i&gt; L.) root rot incited by &lt;i&gt;Fusarium solani.&lt;/i&gt; The field experiment was laid out following a completely randomized block design (CRBD) with two treatments; non-inoculated control and AMF-inoculation in triplicates. The effects of the EOs were tested against mycelial growth, conidia and common bean seeds germination. Promising concentrations were thereafter assessed for their suppressive effect against &lt;i&gt;Fusariun solani in planta&lt;/i&gt;. A significantly higher collar diameter, hypocotyl branching and subsequent Mycorrhizal Dependency (MD) in mycorrhizal lemongrass [(+)AMF] compared to non-inoculated counterpart [(-)AMF]. The resulting EOs consistently repressed &lt;i&gt;F. solani&lt;/i&gt; Fs4 conidia germination and mycelium deployment in a dose-dependent manner, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 500 ppm for both the EOs, and 125 ppm for the reference fungicide (Ridomil Plus 44 WP). The EO from mycorrhizal lemongrass protected the common bean plantlets from infection by &lt;i&gt;F. solani&lt;/i&gt; Fs4 both in laboratory and greenhouse conditions, leading to healthier and vigorous plantlets. The best protection rate was once more obtained with EO from AMF-primed lemongrass at the concentration of 1000 ppm (65.0%) while the lowest disease severity was obtained with Ridomil Plus 44 WP (63.13%). Overall, AMF inoculation shifted the lemongrass biochemical processes with subsequent impact on growth, and an enhanced suppression in Fusarium root rot under greenhouse conditions.">

The films showed forming capacity, however, was observed a decrease in solubility and revealed an increase in hydrophobic characteristics. However, the oil reduced the tensile strength and elongation, while the microcapsules did not influence the mechanical properties in comparison to the control film. From microstructure analysis, changes in the films roughness and surface were observed after the addition of oil both directly and in microencapsulated form.

The aerial parts of European goldenrod have long been used for urinary tract conditions and as an anti-inflammatory agent in the traditional medicine of different peoples. Its main chemical constituents are flavonoids (mainly derived from quercetin and kaempferol), C6-C1 and C6-C3 compounds, terpenes (mostly from the essential oil), and a large number of saponin molecules (mainly virgaureasaponins and solidagosaponins). Published research on its potential activities is critically reviewed here: antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, spasmolitic, antihypertensive, diuretic, antibacterial, antifungal, antiparasite, cytotoxic and antitumor, antimutagenic, antiadipogenic, antidiabetic, cardioprotective, and antisenescence. The evidence concerning its potential benefits is mainly derived from non-clinical studies, some effects are rather modest, whereas others are more promising, but need more confirmation in both non-clinical models and clinical trials.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Salvia officinalis&lt;/i&gt; L. (sage) is one of the most appreciated plants for its plethora of biologically active compounds. The objective of our research was a comparative study, in the Mediterranean context, of chemical composition, anticholinesterases, and antioxidant properties of essential oils (EOs) from sage collected in three areas (S1-S3) of Southern Italy. EOs were extracted by hydrodistillation and analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibitory properties were investigated by employing Ellman's method. Four in vitro assays, namely, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), ferric-reducing ability power (FRAP), and β-carotene bleaching tests, were used to study the antioxidant effects. Camphor (16.16-18.92%), 1,8-cineole (8.80-9.86%), β-pinene (3.08-9.14%), camphene (6.27-8.08%), and α-thujone (1.17-9.26%) are identified as the most abundant constituents. However, the content of these constituents varied depending on environmental factors and pedoclimatic conditions. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed. Based on Relative Antioxidant Capacity Index (RACI), S2 essential oil exhibited the highest radical potential with an IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value of 20.64 μg/mL in ABTS test and presented the highest protection of lipid peroxidation with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values of 38.06 and 46.32 μg/mL after 30 and 60 min of incubation, respectively. The most promising inhibitory activity against BChE was found for S3 sample (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of 33.13 μg/mL).">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Laggera tomentosa&lt;/i&gt; Sch. Bip. ex Oliv. et Hiern (Asteraceae), an endemic Ethiopian medicinal plant, is traditionally used to treat various ailments. Previously, the chemical constituents of the essential oil (EO) of its leaves and inflorescence were documented. However, no data about the chemical compositions of other parts of the EOs of the plant have been reported to date. Moreover, there are no previous biological activity reports on any parts of the EOs of this plant. Thus, in this study, the EOs were isolated from the stem bark and roots of this plant by hydrodistillation and analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to identify their components. In addition, antibacterial potentials of the oils were evaluated using the disc diffusion and minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) methods. 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and hydrogen peroxide methods were also employed to assess their antioxidant properties. Oxygenated monoterpenes (71.82% and 77.51%), of which 2,5-dimethoxy- &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; -cymene (57.28% and 64.76%) and thymol methyl ether (9.51% and 8.93%) were identified as major components in the EOs of stem bark and roots of &lt;i&gt;L. tomentosa&lt;/i&gt; and the oils, were the most potent in the DPPH (IC50, 0.33 ± 1.10 and 0.39 ± 0.97 mg/mL) assay, respectively. Moreover, the EOs demonstrated appreciable activity towards the gram+ ( &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;B. cereus&lt;/i&gt; ) bacteria. Among these oils, the oil of the stem bark showed the greatest activity to the gram+ (MIC = 0.625 mg/mL) bacteria. Therefore, the overall results suggested that the EOs of &lt;i&gt;L. tomentosa&lt;/i&gt; may be a promising prospect for pharmaceutical, food, and other industrial applications.">

These by-products of oxygen metabolism play a key role in the development of various human diseases such as cancer, diabetes, heart failure, brain damage, muscle problems, premature aging, eye injuries, and a weakened immune system. Synthetic and natural antioxidants, which act as free radical scavengers, are widely used in the food and beverage industries. The toxicity and carcinogenic effects of some synthetic antioxidants have generated interest in natural alternatives, especially plant-derived polyphenols (e.g., phenolic acids, flavonoids, stilbenes, tannins, coumarins, lignins, lignans, quinines, curcuminoids, chalcones, and essential oil terpenoids). This review focuses on the well-known phenolic antioxidant rosmarinic acid (RA), an ester of caffeic acid and (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-(+)-3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl) lactic acid, describing its wide distribution in thirty-nine plant families and the potential productivity of plant sources. A botanical and phytochemical description is provided of a new rich source of RA, &lt;i&gt;Satureja khuzistanica&lt;/i&gt; Jamzad (Lamiaceae).

        <span class="abst" title="Impetigo (school sores) is a common superficial bacterial skin infection affecting around 162 million children worldwide, with the highest burden in Australian Aboriginal children. While impetigo itself is treatable, if left untreated, it can lead to life-threatening conditions, such as chronic heart and kidney diseases. Topical antibiotics are often considered the treatment of choice for impetigo, but the clinical efficacy of these treatments is declining at an alarming rate due to the rapid emergence and spread of resistant bacteria. In remote settings in Australia, topical antibiotics are no longer used for impetigo due to the troubling rise of antimicrobial resistance, demanding the use of oral and injectable antibiotic therapies. However, widespread use of these agents not only contributes to existing resistance, but also associated with adverse consequences for individuals and communities. These underscore the urgent need to reinvigorate the antibiotic discovery and alternative impetigo therapies in these settings. This review discusses the current impetigo treatment challenges in endemic settings in Australia and explores potential alternative antimicrobial therapies. The goals are to promote intensified research programs to facilitate effective use of currently available treatments, as well as developing new alternatives for impetigo.">

        <span class="abst" title="Mints have been among the most widely used herbs for medicinal purposes since ancient civilizations. They are still presently used for numerous purposes, including non-medicinal, which makes them economically relevant herbs. Information regarding the medical and scientific uses given to mints throughout history are vastly scattered and/or incomplete. The aim of this paper is to provide an extensive descriptive overview of the medical uses given to these herbs, highlighting both the authors in medical culture responsible for their dissemination, as well as their major galenic formulations. Databases on medical science, reference textbooks on medical history, botanics (aromatic herbs), and pharmacognosy were consulted. The use of mints remotes to Classical Antiquity, with major contributions from Pliny the Elder. In the Middle Ages, the increased knowledge surrounding mints came from Byzantine physicians, while, in the Modern Age, technological developments allowed the production of mint-based products which have become part of elaborate galenic formulas employed by an increasing number of physicians, as well as have also stimulated both scientific and artistic interests alike. In present-day medicine, several mints and mint-based products are being researched as potential therapeutic alternatives for many diseases, while also being vastly employed in food and cosmetic industries.">

        <span class="abst" title="Recently, increasing public concern about hygiene has been driving many studies to investigate antimicrobial and antiviral agents. However, the use of any antimicrobial agents must be limited due to their possible toxic or harmful effects. In recent years, due to previous antibiotics' lesser side effects, the use of herbal materials instead of synthetic or chemical drugs is increasing. Herbal materials are found in medicines. Herbs can be used in the form of plant extracts or as their active components. Furthermore, most of the world's populations used herbal materials due to their strong antimicrobial properties and primary healthcare benefits. For example, herbs are an excellent material to replace nanosilver as an antibiotic and antiviral agent. The use of nanosilver involves an ROS-mediated mechanism that might lead to oxidative stress-related cancer, cytotoxicity, and heart diseases. Oxidative stress further leads to increased ROS production and also delays the cellular processes involved in wound healing. Therefore, existing antibiotic drugs can be replaced with biomaterials such as herbal medicine with high antimicrobial, antiviral, and antioxidant activity. This review paper highlights the antibacterial, antiviral, and radical scavenger (antioxidant) properties of herbal materials. Antimicrobial activity, radical scavenger ability, the potential for antimicrobial, antiviral, and anticancer agents, and efficacy in eliminating bacteria and viruses and scavenging free radicals in herbal materials are discussed in this review. The presented herbal antimicrobial agents in this review include clove, portulaca, tribulus, eryngium, cinnamon, turmeric, ginger, thyme, pennyroyal, mint, fennel, chamomile, burdock, eucalyptus, primrose, lemon balm, mallow, and garlic, which are all summarized.">

The association of natural products and nanotechnology is important to improve the antifungal potential of medicinal plants. We aimed to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo anti-&lt;i&gt;Candida albicans&lt;/i&gt; activity of unloaded (EO) and loaded (ME+EO) essential oil of &lt;i&gt;Cymbopogon nardus&lt;/i&gt; in the microemulsion (ME).&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;The chemical analysis of the EO was performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The ME and ME+EO were characterized by scattering, zeta potential, polarized light microscopy, rheological assays, mucoadhesiveness and transmission electronic microscopy. The in vitro antifungal activity of the EO and ME+EO were evaluated by microdilution technique. The toxicity of EO and ME+EO was analyzed on human cell line HaCat and using alternative model assay with &lt;i&gt;Artemia salina&lt;/i&gt;. The experimental in vivo VVC was performed in female mice (C57BL/6).&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The main compounds of the EO were found to be citronellal, geranial, geraniol, citronellol, and neral. The formulations exhibited suitable size, homogeneity, negative charge, isotropic behavior, highly organized structure, and pseudoplastic behavior, for vaginal application. TEM photomicrographs showed possible EO droplets inside the spherical structures. The EO, when loaded into the ME, exhibited an improvement in its antifungal action against &lt;i&gt;C. albicans&lt;/i&gt;. The EO was not toxic against brine shrimp nauplii. An in vivo VVC assay showed that the use of the ME significantly improved the action of the EO, since only the ME+EO promoted the eradication of the fungal vaginal infection on the third day of treatment.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;The EO and ME+EO are promising alternatives for the control of fungal infections caused by &lt;i&gt;C. albicans&lt;/i&gt;, once the use of nanotechnology significantly improved the antifungal action of the EO, especially in an in vivo model of VVC.">

The flora is determined by complex historical and environmental factors occurring since the Tertiary period. The originality of this sector is due to the presence of the argan tree (Argania spinosa (L.) Skeels), Moroccan gum (Acacia gummifera Willd), olive trees (Olea europaea L. subsp. maroccana (Greuter &amp; Burdet) P. Vargas &amp; al.), a thermophilic flora adapted to an arid climate with several endemic species. This flora constitutes the final barrier against the desert and is of environmental and socioeconomical interest. Leaves and fruits provide forage material, while wood is used for fuel. Argan fruits are collected for their oily constitutes and for nutritional, cosmetic, and medicinal properties. Additionally, many species of Argan ecosystems are used in medicine and cosmetics. Recognizing its ecological value and local economic importance, the Argan region was declared a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 1998. Despite their biogeographical, historical, and socioeconomic value, vegetation structures in west-central Morocco are vulnerable and threatened by human activities. They exhibit high levels of degradation due to increasing clearance, overgrazing, and overexploitation. The area requires high conservation priority and sustainable management strategies for key species and genetic diversity.">

Compared to control group, treated groups did not show significant abnormalities in body weight and most parameters of clinical chemistry parameters and relative organ weight in repeated-dose toxicity study. However, urea, albumin, aspartate aminotransferase, and relative organ weight of right kidney showed variations in treated groups compared to control group. All treated groups and control group showed normal histology except lymphocytic infiltrates observed on the kidney with 200 mg/kg treated female group.

The test was conducted in the microbiology laboratory of the &lt;i&gt;Universidad Nacional Federico Villarreal&lt;/i&gt;. The essential oil was prepared by steam distillation, which means that the pressure steam enters in connection with the plant cells and breaks them, releasing the essence and trapping it in drops of water. Cinnamon essential oil was obtained using the hydrodistillation method, subsequently the oil obtained was dehydrated with sodium sulfate and then filtered at 0.22 µm. Then the vials were stored at a temperature of 4°C. Finally, &lt;i&gt;Candida albicans&lt;/i&gt; ATCC 10231 was used as the biological material. Antifungal efficacy was measured by the Kirby-Bauer method (disk diffusion).&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;It was found that in the 24-h group the concentration that had the greatest antifungal effect was 100% EOC with a mean of 22.1 ± 11 mm; however, the lowest antifungal activity was seen in the 25% EOC with 17.9 ± 1.6 mm. On the contrary, in the 48-h group, it was shown that the highest antifungal efficacy was also observed in the 100% EOC with an average of 31.2 ± 3.2 mm, but the lowest antifungal activity was in the 25% EOC with 22.6 ± 1.7 mm.

In TCM theory, patchouli can treat colds, nausea, fever, headache, and diarrhea. Various bioactive compounds have been identified in patchouli, including terpenoids, phytosterols, flavonoids, organic acids, lignins, glycosides, alcohols, pyrone, and aldehydes. Among the numerous compounds, patchouli alcohol, β-patchoulene, patchoulene epoxide, pogostone, and pachypodol are of great importance. The pharmacological impacts of these compounds include anti-peptic ulcer effect, antimicrobial effect, anti-oxidative effect, anti-inflammatory effect, effect on ischemia/reperfusion injury, analgesic effect, antitumor effect, antidiabetic effect, anti-hypertensive effect, immunoregulatory effect, and others.For this review, we examined publications from the previous five years collected from PubMed, Web of Science, Springer, and the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure databases. This review summarizes the recent progress in phytochemistry, pharmacology, and mechanisms of action and provides a reference for future studies focused on clinical applications of this important plant extract.">

The essential oil (EO) from &lt;i&gt;R. beesianus&lt;/i&gt; rhizome has been used as an aromatic stomachic in China. The chemical composition and biological activities of EO from &lt;i&gt;R. beesianus&lt;/i&gt; rhizome were reported for the first time. Based on gas chromatography with flame ionization or mass selective detection (GC-FID/MS) results, the major constituents of EO were 1,8-cineole (47.6%), borneol (15.0%), methyleugenol (11.2%), and bornyl formate (7.6%). For bioactivities, EO showed a significant antibacterial activity against &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Enterococcus faecalis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Proteus vulgaris&lt;/i&gt; with the diameter of the inhibition zone (DIZ) (8.66-10.56 mm), minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) (3.13-6.25 mg/mL), and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) (6.25-12.5 mg/mL). Moreover, EO (128 μg/mL) significantly inhibited the production of proinflammatory mediators nitric oxide (NO) (92.73 ± 1.50%) and cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (20.29 ± 0.17%) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) (61.08 ± 0.13%) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW264.7 macrophages without any cytotoxic effect. Moreover, EO exhibited significant acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity (the concentration of the sample that affords a 50% inhibition in the assay (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) = 1.03 ± 0.18 mg/mL) and moderate α-glucosidase inhibition effect (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 11.60 ± 0.25 mg/mL). Thus, the EO could be regarded as a bioactive natural product and has a high exploitation potential in the cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries.">

Although treatment options are readily available, most drugs often cause serious side effects. Extracts of &lt;i&gt;Dracocephalum kotschyi&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;D. kotschyi&lt;/i&gt;) have shown significant pharmacological activity against various parasites, viruses, and bacteria. In this study, we evaluated the anti-&lt;i&gt;T. gondii&lt;/i&gt; activity in vitro and in vivo of &lt;i&gt;D. kotschyi&lt;/i&gt; essential oil. The thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT) method was used to assess the anti-&lt;i&gt;T. gondii&lt;/i&gt; activity and cytotoxicity of the essential oil. The presence of &lt;i&gt;T. gondii&lt;/i&gt; was observed by Giemsa staining, and the viability was evaluated by the trypan blue staining method. Furthermore, the survival rate of acutely infected mice was evaluated by intraperitoneal injecting of the essential oil (50, 100, and 200 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; day&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) for five days after infection with 2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; tachyzoites. Essential oil, negative, and positive controls that showed the best toxoplasmacidal activity were assayed in triplicate at each concentration. The essential oil exhibited the highest anti-&lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/i&gt; activity with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) of 9.94 ± 0.38 µg, with a selectivity index of 2.463. On Vero cells, the CC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of the oil was 24.49 ± 0.96 µg and exhibited a significant anti-&lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/i&gt; activity. Moreover, the treatment by essential oil significantly increased the survival rate compared to untreated infected control. In conclusion, the essential oil might be a useful compound, and with more testing, it may be an excellent alternative to standard chemical drugs in the treatment of toxoplasmosis.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background and aim&lt;/h4&gt;As an alternative to natural and chemically synthesized direct-acting bactericides, there has been an increase in the use of plant extracts, which possess a set of phytochemicals with potential for microbial disease control; this is due to the spectrum of secondary metabolites present in extracts, which include phenolic compounds, quinones, flavonoids, alkaloids, terpenoids, and polyacetylenes. The biologically active substances within plant extracts, which perform protective functions for plant tissues, can have ambiguous effects on the animal body. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the ability of gamma-octalactone, isolated from &lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus viminalis&lt;/i&gt; extract, to inhibit various LuxI/LuxR quorum-sensing (QS) systems in bacteria, and to evaluate its effect on broiler chickens.&lt;h4&gt;Materials and methods&lt;/h4&gt;Phytochemical analysis of &lt;i&gt;E. viminalis&lt;/i&gt; extract was performed. The ability of gamma-octalactone to inhibit QS was evaluated using four different LuxI/LuxR bacterial test systems. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt; assessments were performed on one hundred and twenty 7-day-old broiler chickens (Arbor Acres cross), split into four groups of 30 chickens: 1. Control group: Basic diet (BD); 2. experimental Group I: BD + gamma-octalactone at a dosage of 0.05 ml/kg live weight/day; 3. experimental Group II: BD + gamma-octalactone at a dosage of 0.1 ml/kg live weight/day; and 4. experimental Group III: BD + gamma-octalactone at a dosage of 0.2 ml/kg live weight/day. Hematological blood parameters were assessed using an automatic hematological analyzer (URIT-2900 Vet Plus, URIT Medial Electronic Co., China) and an automatic biochemical analyzer (CS-T240, Dirui Industrial Co., Ltd., China). Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics Version 20 (IBM); averages (M), standard deviations (σ), and standard deviation errors (m) were calculated. Results with p≤0.05 were considered significant.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Based on the phytochemical analysis results, libraries of compounds with putative QS inhibitory properties were compiled. Gamma-octalactone exhibited a pronounced inhibitory effect on the LuxI/LuxR QS systems, characterized by EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values of 0.15-0.4 mM. In the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; portion of this study, broiler chicken live weights increased in all experimental groups, with the most significant increase in Group III (14.0%), in relation to the control group. Blood serum from the experimental group chickens had significantly higher levels of triglycerides and uric acid (p≤0.05), in comparison to the control group chickens. With respect to blood serum enzyme activity and antioxidant status indicators, the experimental group chickens had a higher level of gamma-glutamyl transferase, an enzyme associated with amino acid metabolism, than those in the control group; this increase was especially pronounced in Group III, with 37.0% increase (p≤0.05). Superoxide dismutase and catalase levels were higher in the experimental groups than the control group, corresponding to increases of 30.4-56.2% (p≤0.05), 33.3-83.3%, and 27.9-45.5% (p≤0.05) in Groups I, II, and III (p≤0.05), respectively. Morphological blood parameters did not display significant changes due to gamma-octalactone.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;According to the results of this &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; study in broiler chickens, gamma-octalactone, isolated from &lt;i&gt;E. viminalis&lt;/i&gt; leaf extract and supplied at a dosage of 0.2 ml/kg live weight/day, led to an increase in the activity of blood plasma digestive enzymes, increased live weight, and had a positive effect on lipid metabolism and antioxidant status.">

The experiments were carried out as a completely randomized design in three replicates. Many postharvest characteristics have been evaluated, such as the vase life of cut flowers, diameters of head flowers and stem, dry matter of flowers, total vase water uptake, total loss of water, relative fresh weight. Additionally, the chlorophyll contents, total sugar, and bacterial counts were determined. The results showed that the longest vase life of cut chrysanthemum was 36.50, 33.40 days, and 35.88, 31.33 days by addition of either the thyme oil (500 mg/l) or clove oil (250 mg/l) in holding solution as compared with distilled water (18.09 and 17.22 days) in both seasons. The highest total vase water uptake and relative fresh weight were (225.00, 211.05 g/flower/day) and (79.89, 70.37 %) of cut chrysanthemum treated with 500 mg/l thyme oil in both seasons. Whereas the lowest total water loss in the two seasons was 155.11 and 156.60 g/flower/day was found with 400 mg/l thyme oil. The greatest chlorophyll a, b, carotenoids, and total sugar contents obtained from treated cut chrysanthemum with 500 mg/l thyme oil (6.89, 2.37, 5.99 mg/g, and 0.88 mg/gm D.W, respectively). Furthermore, the treatment of cut flowers with selected oils has significantly decreased the bacterial growth compared to the control. Whereas the minimum bacterial activities were &lt;1 C.F.U/ml with cut chrysanthemum fortified with 500 mg/l thyme and clove oils. Moreover, the superlative treatments with thyme (500 mg/l) and clove (250 mg/l) showed a prime state of xylem vessels comparable with the control.thus, the usage (addition) of thyme and clove oils as a natural preservative in holding solutions instead of chemicals would be of great economic and environmental impact (Values).">

In this context, medicinal plants emerge as an effective alternative to replace the use antibiotics. The essential oil (EO) of &lt;i&gt;Minthostachys verticillata&lt;/i&gt; (Griseb.) Epling (Lamiaceae) has demonstrated a strong antimicrobial activity. However, its instability and hydrophobicity under normal storage conditions are limitations to its use. Nanoemulsion technology is an excellent way to solubilize, microencapsulate, and protect this compound. This study aimed to obtain a nanoemulsion based on &lt;i&gt;M. verticillata&lt;/i&gt; EO and evaluate its antibacterial activity against &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;. The EO was obtained by steam distillation. Identification and quantification of their components were determined by GC-MS revealing that the dominated chemical group was oxygenated monoterpenes. Nanoemulsions (NE) were characterized by measuring pH, transmittance, separation percentage, release profile, and morphology. The effect of NE on the growth of &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt; and cyto-compatibility was also evaluated. The results showed that NE containing a higher percentage of tween 20 exhibited higher stability with an approximated droplet size of 10 nm. The effect of encapsulation process was evaluated by GC-MS revealing that the volatile components in EO were no affected. After 24 h, 74.24 ± 0.75% of EO was released from NE and the antibacterial activity of EO was enhanced considerably by its encapsulation. The incubation of &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt; with the NE and pure EO, show a bacterial growth inhibition of 58.87% ± 0.99 and 46.72% ± 3.32 (p &lt; 0.05), respectively. In addition, nanoemulsión did not cause toxicity to porcine and equine red blood cells. The results obtained showed that NE could be a potential vehicle for &lt;i&gt;M. verticillata&lt;/i&gt; EO with promissory properties to emerge as a tool for developing advanced therapies to control and combat infections.">

        <span class="abst" title="The baobab seed oil has been consumed by humans due to its medicinal and nutrient values for many years. However, the consumption of baobab seed oil has been perceived by different communities as a health risk caused by cyclopropenoid fatty acids (CPFAs), which are carcinogenic ingredients present in the oil. This study investigated the physicochemical properties and fatty acid profile of baobab crude seed oil collected from semiarid areas in Tanzania and determined the effects of heating on the reduction of CPFAs. The baobab seed crude oil was extracted by Soxhlet using n-hexane, and the fatty acid composition of the baobab seed crude oil was determined by gas-liquid chromatography (GLC). Since CPFAs are resistant to lower temperatures, the effect of heating on the CPFA content of baobab crude seed oil was studied at 150°C, 200°C, and 250°C. The &lt;i&gt;A. digitata&lt;/i&gt; crude seed oil was found to contain mainly twelve essential fatty acids and two different CPFAs. The most abundant fatty acids were palmitic acid, oleic acid, and linoleic acid in all the baobab population hotspots occurring in Tanzania. There was no significant difference in most physicochemical properties and fatty acid composition across the different semiarid areas in Tanzania. The major breakdown of CPFAs occurs at 200°C, and that would be the optimal temperature recommended for the refining process of the baobab crude oil. The study recommended refining of the baobab oil at higher temperatures ranging from 200 - 250°C as the best way of reducing CPFAs.">

This review provides information regarding the conventional and recent extraction methods of &lt;i&gt;C. longa&lt;/i&gt; rhizome oil, their characteristics and suitability to be applied at the industrial scale. In addition, variations in the chemical composition of &lt;i&gt;C. longa&lt;/i&gt; rhizome and leaf essential oils regarding intrinsic and extrinsic factors and extraction methods are also analysed in order to select the most proper to obtain the most efficient activity. Finally, the potential applications of &lt;i&gt;C. longa&lt;/i&gt; rhizome oil in the agri-food industry, such as antimicrobial, weedicide and a food preservative agent, are included. Regarding the data, &lt;i&gt;C. longa&lt;/i&gt; rhizome essential oil may play a special role in the agri-food industry; however, further research to determine the application threshold so as not to damage crops or affect the organoleptic properties of food products, as well as efficient encapsulation techniques, are necessary for its implementation in global agriculture.">

Among them, the so-called &quot;antioxidants&quot; have a major potentiality to increase human wellness. Antioxidants are important components in the signaling and defense mechanisms in some plants, where they are precursors of compounds of greater complexity, the modulator of plant growth, and the defensive system against pathogenic organisms and predators. The extraordinary variety of chemical structure and substitution present in the different plant antioxidants make them an inestimable source of interesting compounds, with the ability to counter reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) and to stimulate the activation of signal cascade inside the cells. The mechanisms by which antioxidants detoxify these dangerous compounds are complex and involve either direct or indirect interaction with radicals. Antioxidants inhibit or quench free radical reactions mainly based on their reducing capacity or hydrogen atom-donating capacity, their solubility, and chelating properties. Moreover, their ability to modulate key metabolic enzymes and activate/block gene transcription also has remarkable importance.">

        <span class="abst" title="Wild food plants (WFP) have always been present in our kitchen, although they have not always been given the same importance as crops. In the Catalan linguistic area (CLA), covered in this paper, WFP were of great importance as a subsistence food not only during the years of the Spanish civil war (1936-1939) and World War II (1939-1945), but also long before these periods and in the years thereafter. The CLA has been well studied at the level of traditional knowledge on plant biodiversity, and much of this information is collected in a database by the EtnoBioFiC research group. The aim of this work is to carry out a meta-analysis of the WFP dataset of he CLA (only regarding edible uses, drinks excluded) and to identify the most quoted plants, and the information associated with them. With data from 1659 informants, we recorded 10,078 use reports of 291 taxa (278 of which at specific or subspecific levels and 13 only determined at generic level) belonging to 67 families. The most reported taxa, also with highest cultural importance indexes, are &lt;i&gt;Thymus vulgaris&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Foeniculum vulgare&lt;/i&gt; subsp. &lt;i&gt;piperitum&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Laurus nobilis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Rubus ulmifolius&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Mentha spicata&lt;/i&gt;. The ethnobotanicity index for food plants is 6.62% and the informant consensus factor, also for food uses, is a very high 0.97, supporting the robustness of the information. The results provided and discussed in this work concern a significant part of the edible resources in the territory considered, which is, often and mainly, underestimated and underutilised. Its consideration could be an opportunity to promote closer and more sustainable agriculture. From the state-of-the-art of this question, it is possible to propose old, in some cases forgotten foods that could be newly introduced onto the market, first, but not only, at a local level, which could be interesting for new crop development in the frame of a valorisation of territorial identity.">

        <span class="abst" title="Plants and their constituents have been used to treat diverse ailments since time immemorial. Many plants are used in diverse external and internal formulations (infusions, alcoholic extracts, essential oils (EOs), etc.) in the treatment of inflammation-associated diseases, such as those affecting the respiratory tract or causing gastrointestinal or joint problems, among others. To support the traditional uses of plant extracts, EOs have been assessed for their alleged anti-inflammatory properties. However, the effect of EOs on the release of cytokines and chemokines has been much less reported. Considering their traditional use and commercial relevance in Portugal and Angola, this study evaluated the effect of EOs on the in vitro inhibition of the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and the chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated human acute monocytic leukemia cells (THP-1 cells). Twenty EOs extracted from eighteen species from seven families, namely from Amaranthaceae (&lt;i&gt;Dysphania ambrosioides&lt;/i&gt;), Apiaceae (&lt;i&gt;Foeniculum vulgare&lt;/i&gt;), Asteraceae (&lt;i&gt;Brachylaena huillensis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Solidago virgaurea&lt;/i&gt;), Euphorbiaceae (&lt;i&gt;Spirostachys africana&lt;/i&gt;), Lamiaceae (&lt;i&gt;Lavandula luisieri&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Mentha cervina&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Origanum majorana&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Satureja montana&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Thymbra capitata&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Thymus mastichina&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Thymus vulgaris&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Thymus zygis&lt;/i&gt; subsp. &lt;i&gt;zygis&lt;/i&gt;), Myrtaceae (&lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus globulus&lt;/i&gt; subsp. &lt;i&gt;maidenii&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus radiata&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus viminalis&lt;/i&gt;) and Pinaceae (&lt;i&gt;Pinus pinaster&lt;/i&gt;) were assayed for the release of CCL2 and TNF-α by LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells. &lt;i&gt;B. huillensis, S. africana, S. montana, Th. mastichina&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Th. vulgaris&lt;/i&gt; EOs showed toxicity to THP-1 cells, at the lowest concentration tested (10 μg/mL), using the tetrazolium dye assay. The most active EOs in reducing TNF-α release by LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells were those of &lt;i&gt;T. capitata&lt;/i&gt; (51% inhibition at 20 μg/mL) and &lt;i&gt;L. luisieri&lt;/i&gt; (15-23% inhibition at 30 μg/mL and 78-83% inhibition at 90 μg/mL). &lt;i&gt;L. luisieri&lt;/i&gt; EO induced a concentration-dependent inhibition of CCL2 release by LPS‑stimulated THP-1 cells (23%, 54% and 82% inhibition at 10, 30 and 90 μg/mL, respectively). These EOs are potentially useful in the management of inflammatory diseases mediated by CCL2 and TNF‑α, such as atherosclerosis and arthritis.">

Mainly due to the polyphenols contained in &lt;i&gt;S. hortensis&lt;/i&gt; L., this plant exhibits multiple biological effects. However, therapeutic effects on cells, including skin tumors, have not yet been studied. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the composition and the resulting antioxidant as well as biological properties [on melanocytes and melanoma cells] of summer, savory growing in botanical garden of Vytautas Magnus University in middle Lithuania climatic conditions, collected during various phases of vegetation. It has been shown that the budding phase alcohol extract of this plant contains the largest amounts of polyphenols, including rutin and rosemary acid, which promote the radical scavenging activity and antioxidant properties. In contrast, the extract from the massive flowering phase already at a concentration of 12.5 µg/mL reduces the survival of melanoma cells to 60% with 90% melanocytes survival. In addition, extracts from beginning of flowering and end of flowering at a concentration of 25 µg/mL, containing significantly less rutin and rosmarinic acid, in combination with irradiation of cells with UVB, significantly increased the lipid peroxidation process, particularly in melanoma cells. These data indicate the possibility of using extracts from &lt;i&gt;S. hortensis&lt;/i&gt; L. to modulate/differentiate the metabolism of normal and tumor skin cells.">

        <span class="abst" title="Silphion was an ancient medicinal gum-resin; most likely obtained from a &lt;i&gt;Ferula&lt;/i&gt; species growing in the Cyrene region of Libya ca. 2500 years ago. Due to its therapeutic properties and culinary value, silphion became the main economic commodity of the Cyrene region. It is generally believed that the source of silphion became extinct in the first century AD. However, there are a few references in the literature about the cultivated silphion plant and its existence up to the fifth century. Recently, a rare and endemic &lt;i&gt;Ferula&lt;/i&gt; species that produces a pleasant-smelling gum-resin was found in three locations near formerly Greek villages in Anatolia. Morphologic features of this species closely resemble silphion, as it appears in the numismatic figures of antique Cyrenaic coins, and conform to descriptions by ancient authors. Initial chemical and pharmacological investigations of this species have confirmed the medicinal and spice-like quality of its gum-resin supporting a connection with the long-lost silphion. A preliminary conservation study has been initiated at the growth site of this rare endemic &lt;i&gt;Ferula&lt;/i&gt; species. The results of this study and their implications on the regional extinction event, and future development of this species will be discussed.">

        <span class="abst" title="Fungal infections affect 300 million people and cause 1.5 million deaths globally per year. With the number of immunosuppressed patients increasing steadily, there is an increasing number of patients infected with opportunistic fungal infections such as infections caused by the species of &lt;i&gt;Candida&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Cryptococcus&lt;/i&gt;. In fact, the drug-resistant &lt;i&gt;Can. krusei&lt;/i&gt; and the emerging pan-antifungal resistant &lt;i&gt;Can. auris&lt;/i&gt; pose a serious threat to human health as the existing limited antifungals are futile. To further complicate therapy, fungi produce capsules and spores that are resistant to most antifungal drugs/host defenses. Novel antifungal drugs are urgently needed to fill unmet medical needs. From screening a collection of medicinal plant sources for antifungal activity, we have identified an active fraction from the rhizome of &lt;i&gt;Cyperus rotundus&lt;/i&gt;, the nut grass plant. The fraction contained α-Cyperone, an essential oil that showed fungicidal activity against different species of &lt;i&gt;Candida&lt;/i&gt;. Interestingly, the minimal inhibitory concentration of α-Cyperone was reduced 8-fold when combined with a clinical antifungal drug, fluconazole, indicating its antifungal synergistic potential and could be useful for combination therapy. Furthermore, α-Cyperone affected the synthesis of the capsule in &lt;i&gt;Cryp. neoformans&lt;/i&gt;, a causative agent of fungal meningitis in humans. Further work on mechanistic understanding of α-Cyperone against fungal virulence could help develop a novel antifungal agent for drug-resistant fungal pathogens.">

The total phenolic and total flavonoid contents, together with the biological activities of the derived essential oils and methanol extracts, were also investigated. Herein, the success of obtaining sequences of these plant using two different barcode genes &lt;i&gt;mat&lt;/i&gt;K and &lt;i&gt;rbc&lt;/i&gt;L were 62.5% and 100%, respectively. Both regions were discriminated by around 700 base pairs and these had resemblance with those of the Clausenae materials earlier deposited in Genbank at a 99-100% degree of identity. Additionally, the use of &lt;i&gt;mat&lt;/i&gt;K DNA sequences could positively confirm the identity as monophyletic. The highest total phenolic and total flavonoid content values (&lt;i&gt;p &lt;&lt;/i&gt; 0.05) were observed in the methanol extract of &lt;i&gt;M. koenigii&lt;/i&gt; at 43.50 mg GAE/g extract and 66.13 mg QE/g extract, respectively. Furthermore, anethole was detected as the dominant compound in &lt;i&gt;C. excavata&lt;/i&gt; (86.72%) and &lt;i&gt;C. harmandiana&lt;/i&gt; (46.09%). Moreover, anethole (26.02%) and caryophyllene (21.15%) were identified as the major phytochemical compounds of &lt;i&gt;M. koenigii&lt;/i&gt;. In terms of the biological properties, the &lt;i&gt;M. koenigii&lt;/i&gt; methanol extract was found to display the greatest amount of antioxidant activity (DPPH; IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; 95.54 µg/mL, ABTS value 118.12 mg GAE/g extract, FRAP value 48.15 mg GAE/g extract), and also revealed the highest &lt;i&gt;α-&lt;/i&gt;glucosidase and antihypertensive inhibitory activities with percent inhibition values of 84.55 and 84.95. Notably, no adverse effects on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were observed with regard to all of the plant extracts. Furthermore, &lt;i&gt;M. koenigii&lt;/i&gt; methanol extract exhibited promise against human lung cancer cells almost at 80% after 24 h and 90% over 48 h.">

Ninety-seven metabolites were identified, accounting for 73.28, 87.03, 74.38, 87.93, 85.83, and 91.39% of &lt;i&gt;Aca&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Ach&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Ale&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Ama&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Amu&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Asi&lt;/i&gt; whole oils, respectively. Sylvestrene was the most predominant component in &lt;i&gt;Asi, Amu&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ama&lt;/i&gt;, with highest concentration in &lt;i&gt;Asi&lt;/i&gt; (64.64%). In addition, (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-2-hexenal was present in a high percentage in both &lt;i&gt;Ale&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ach&lt;/i&gt; (9.97 and 10.1%, respectively). GC-MS based metabolites were subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchal cluster analysis (HCA) to explore the correlations between the six species. The PCA score plot displayed clear differentiation of all &lt;i&gt;Astragalus&lt;/i&gt; species and a high correlation between the &lt;i&gt;Amu&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ama&lt;/i&gt; species. The antioxidant activity was evaluated in vitro using various assays, phosphomolybdenum (PM), 2,2 diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl-hydrate (DPPH), 2,2-azino bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS), cupric reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC), ferric reducing power (FRAP) and ferrous ion chelation (FIC) assays. In addition, the potential for the volatile samples to inhibit both acetyl/butyrylcholinesterases (AChE, BChE), α- amylase, α-glucosidase and tyrosinase was assessed. Most of the species showed considerable antioxidant potential in the performed assays. In the DPPH assay, &lt;i&gt;Ama&lt;/i&gt; exhibited the maximum activity (24.12 ± 2.24 mg TE/g sample), and the volatiles from &lt;i&gt;Amu&lt;/i&gt; exhibited the highest activity (91.54 mgTE/g oil) in the ABTS radical scavenging assay. The effect was more evident in both CUPRAC and FRAP assays, where both &lt;i&gt;Ale&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Ama&lt;/i&gt; showed the strongest activity in comparison with the other tested species (84.06, 80.28 mgTE/g oil for CUPRAC and 49.47, 49.02 mgTE/g oil for FRAP, respectively). &lt;i&gt;Asi&lt;/i&gt; demonstrated the strongest AChE (4.55 mg GALAE/g oil) and BChE (3.61 mg GALAE/g oil) inhibitory effect. Furthermore, the best tyrosinase inhibitory potential was observed for &lt;i&gt;Ale&lt;/i&gt; (138.42 mg KAE/g). Accordingly, &lt;i&gt;Astragalus&lt;/i&gt; species can be utilized as promising natural sources for many medicinally important components that could be tested as drug candidates for treating illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease, diabetes mellitus and oxidative stress-related diseases.">

Therefore, the antinociceptive potential of an aqueous extract (31.6-316 mg/kg, p.o.) and essential oil (30-177 µg/paw, i.pl.) of the plant was assessed using the formalin test. Both preparations inhibited the formalin-induced nociception response (100-316 mg/kg and 100-177 µg/paw, respectively) during the test's second phase. Chemical analysis of the aqueous extract revealed that the major active components were chlorogenic acid (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), 3,4-di-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-(&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-caffeoylquinic acid (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), 3,5-di-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-(&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-caffeoylquinic acid (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;), 4,5-di-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-(&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-caffeoylquinic acid (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;), 3,5-di-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-(&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-caffeoylquinic acid methyl ester (&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;), apigenin (&lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;), genkwanin (&lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;), acacetin (&lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt;).

We then dissect the cellular and molecular mechanisms of sumac's action in modulating many pathophysiological instigators. We show how accumulating evidence supports the antibacterial, antinociceptive, antidiabetic, cardioprotective, neuroprotective, and anticancer effects of this plant, especially that toxicity studies show that sumac is very safe to consume by humans and has little toxicity.

In this work, we studied the effect of &lt;i&gt;Ptychotis verticillata&lt;/i&gt; (PV) essential oil and its derivatives, carvacrol and thymol, in AML cell lines. We demonstrated that a combination of carvacrol and thymol induced tumor cell death with low toxicity on normal cells. Mechanistically, we highlighted that different molecular pathways, including apoptosis, oxidative, reticular stress, autophagy, and necrosis, are implicated in this potential synergistic effect. Using quantitative RT-PCR, Western blotting, and apoptosis inhibitors, we showed that cell death induced by the carvacrol and thymol combination is caspase-dependent in the HL60 cell line and caspase-independent in the other cell lines tested. Further investigations should focus on improving the manufacturing of these compounds and understanding their anti-tumoral mechanisms of action. These efforts will lead to an increase in the efficiency of the oncotherapy strategy regarding AML.">

Antioxidant potential was monitored as: (i) direct antioxidant activity as assessed by 2,2-di-phenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid), and ABTS assays; (ii) DNA damage protection activity; and (iii) cytoprotective activity as assessed via induction of transcription of genes related to the antioxidant response in human keratinocyte cells (HaCaT). The cytoprotective potential of the test substances was further evaluated against ultraviolet radiation B (UVB)- or H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-induced oxidative damage, whereas their regenerative capability was accessed by monitoring the wound closure rate in HaCaT. Μastic oil and major components did not show significant direct antioxidant activity, however they increased the mRNA levels of antioxidant response genes, suggesting indirect antioxidant activity. Treatment of HaCaT with the test substances before and after UVB irradiation resulted in increased cell viability in the cases of pre-treatment with mastic oil or post-treatment with myrcene. Increased cytoprotection was also observed in the case of cell treatment with mastic oil or its major components prior to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exposure. Finally, mastic oil and myrcene demonstrated a favorable dose-dependent effect for cell migration and wound closure. Collectively, mastic essential oil may exert its promising cytoprotective properties through indirect antioxidant mechanisms.">

The treatment for cutaneous infections caused by &lt;i&gt;Trichophyton&lt;/i&gt; spp. are imidazoles (ketoconazole (KTZ)) and triazoles (itraconazole (ITZ)). &lt;i&gt;T. rubrum&lt;/i&gt; can develop resistance to azoles after prolonged exposure to subinhibitory concentrations resulting in therapeutic failures and chronic infections. These problems have stimulated the search for therapeutic alternatives, including essential oils, and their potential use in combination with conventional antifungals. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antifungal activity of tea tree oil (TTO) (&lt;i&gt;Melaleuca alternifolia&lt;/i&gt; essential oil) and the main components against &lt;i&gt;T. rubrum&lt;/i&gt; and to assess whether TTO in association with KTZ/ITZ as reference drugs improves the antifungal activity of these drugs. We used a terpinen-4-ol chemotype (35.88%) TTO, and its antifungal properties were evaluated by minimum inhibitory and minimum fungicidal concentrations in accordance with the CLSI guidelines. The interaction between TTO and azoles was evaluated through the checkerboard and isobologram methods. The results demonstrated both the fungicide activity of TTO on &lt;i&gt;T. rubrum&lt;/i&gt; and the synergism when it was used in combination with azoles. Therefore, this mixture may reduce the minimum effective dose of azole required and minimize the side effects of the therapy. Synergy activity offered a promise for combination topical treatment for superficial mycoses.">

        <span class="abst" title="Mango (&lt;i&gt;Mangifera indica&lt;/i&gt; L.), known as the king of fruits, has an attractive taste and fragrance and high nutritional value. Mango is commercially important in India, where ~55% of the global crop is produced. The fruit has three main parts: pulp, peel, and kernel. The pulp is the most-consumed part, while the peel and kernel are usually discarded. Mango pulp is a source of a variety of reducing sugars, amino acids, aromatic compounds, and functional compounds, such as pectin, vitamins, anthocyanins, and polyphenols. Mango processing generates peels and kernels as bio-wastes, though they also have nutraceutical significance. Functional compounds in the peel, including protocatechuic acids, mangiferin and β-carotene are known for their antimicrobial, anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-carcinogenic properties. The mango kernel has higher antioxidant and polyphenolic contents than the pulp and peel and is used for oil extraction; it's possible usage in combination with corn and wheat flour in preparing nutraceuticals is being increasingly emphasized. This review aims to provide nutraceutical and pharmacological information on all three parts of mango to help understand the defense mechanisms of its functional constituents, and the appropriate use of mangoes to enhance our nutrition and health.">

Apart from the many synthetic chemical compounds, plant-based compounds could provide an array of \suitable candidates for testing against the virus. Studies have confirmed the role of many plants against respiratory viruses when employed either as crude extracts or their active ingredients in pure form. The purpose of this review article is to highlight the importance of phytomedicine against COVID-19. The main aim is to review the mechanistic aspects of most important phytochemical compounds that have showed potential against coronaviruses. Glycyrrhizin from the roots of &lt;i&gt;Glycyrrhiza glabra&lt;/i&gt; has shown promising potential against the previously epidemic coronavirus, SARS-CoV. Other important plants such as &lt;i&gt;Artemisia annua&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Isatis indigotica, Lindera aggregate&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Pelargonium sidoides&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Glychirrhiza&lt;/i&gt; spp. have been employed against SARS-CoV. Active ingredients (e.g. emodin, reserpine, aescin, myricetin, scutellarin, apigenin, luteolin, and betulonic acid) have shown promising results against the coronaviruses. Phytochemicals have demonstrated activity against the coronaviruses through mechanisms such as viral entry inhibition, inhibition of replication enzymes and virus release blockage. However, compared to synthetic drugs, phytomedicine are mechanistically less understood and should be properly evaluated before application. Nonetheless, phytochemicals reduce the tedious job of drug discovery and provide a less time-consuming alternative for drug testing. Therefore, along with other drugs currently tested against COVID-19, plant-based drugs should be included for speedy development of COVID-19 treatment.">

Due to the pharmacological efficacy and the low toxicity of the essential oil of Hyptis crenata (EOHc), we decided to investigate the EOHc antiedematogenic effect in experimental models of inflammation. EOHc was administrated orally at doses of 10-300 mg/kg to male Swiss albino mice. Paw edema was induced by subcutaneous injection in the right hind paw of inflammatory stimuli (carrageenan, dextran, histamine, serotonin, and bradykinin) 60 min after administration of EOHc. EOHc significantly inhibited the induced edema. The inhibitory effect of EOHc on dextran-induced edema extended throughout the experimental time. For the 30, 100, and 300 mg/kg doses of EOHc, the inhibition was of 40.28±1.70, 51.18±2.69, and 59.24±2.13%, respectively. The EOHc inhibitory effect on carrageenan-induced edema started at 10 mg/kg at the second hour (h) and was maintained throughout the observation period. At 30, 100, and 300 mg/kg doses the inhibition started earlier, from 30 min. At the edema peak of 180 min, 56, 76, and 82% inhibition was observed for 30, 100, and 300 mg/kg doses, respectively. Additionally, the effect of EOHc on carrageenan-induced paw edema was influenced by the time of administration. The EOHc also inhibited myeloperoxidase activity. In conclusion, the EOHc showed a potent effect, both preventing and reversing the edema, consistent with its anti-inflammatory use in folk medicine.">

This study therefore, revealed antifungal effect of combined Antifungal Creams (AFCs) with Turmeric Essential Oil (TEO) or Aloe vera Gel (AVG).&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;Phytochemicals and bioactive compounds in TEO and AVG were revealed using GC-MS. Bioactive compounds in plant extracts were compared to known compounds in database library of National Institute of Standards and Technology (U.S.). Antifungal activity and synergistic effect of AFCs with TEO or AVG were carried out using agar well diffusion method.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Phenol, flavonoids, saponins, alkaloids, steroids, terpenoids and cardiac glycosides were present in TEO and AVG. GCMS revealed thirty-six (36) and eighteen (18) bioactive compounds in TEO and AVG, respectively. AFCs displayed zones of inhibition with values ranged from 5.0 to 14.3 mm, TEO was 5.0 to 11.0 mm and AVG was 8.0 to 11.7 mm against tested fungi. Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) by AFCs, TEO and AVG ranged from 1.25 to 10.0 mg/ml. Combinatory effects of AFCs with TEO or AVG revealed synergistic and indifferent properties.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;Development of novel products using bioactive ingredients from plants with commercially available AFCs will serve as potential alternative therapy to cure dermatological infections with no side effects.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;Paeonia lactiflora 'Hangshao' is widely cultivated in China as a traditional Chinese medicine 'Radix Paeoniae Alba'. Due to the abundant unsaturated fatty acids in its seed, it can also be regarded as a new oilseed plant. However, the process of the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids in it has remained unknown. Therefore, transcriptome analysis is helpful to better understand the underlying molecular mechanisms.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Five main fatty acids were detected, including stearic acid, palmitic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid and α-linolenic acid, and their absolute contents first increased and then decreased during seed development. A total of 150,156 unigenes were obtained by transcriptome sequencing. There were 15,005 unigenes annotated in the seven functional databases, including NR, NT, GO, KOG, KEGG, Swiss-Prot and InterPro. Based on the KEGG database, 1766 unigenes were annotated in the lipid metabolism. There were 4635, 12,304, and 18,291 DEGs in Group I (60 vs 30 DAF), Group II (90 vs 60 DAF) and Group III (90 vs 30 DAF), respectively. A total of 1480 DEGs were detected in the intersection of the three groups. In 14 KEGG pathways of lipid metabolism, 503 DEGs were found, belonging to 111 enzymes. We screened out 123 DEGs involved in fatty acid biosynthesis (39 DEGs), fatty acid elongation (33 DEGs), biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acid (24 DEGs), TAG assembly (17 DEGs) and lipid storage (10 DEGs). Furthermore, qRT-PCR was used to analyze the expression patterns of 16 genes, including BBCP, BC, MCAT, KASIII, KASII, FATA, FATB, KCR, SAD, FAD2, FAD3, FAD7, GPAT, DGAT, OLE and CLO, most of which showed the highest expression at 45 DAF, except for DGAT, OLE and CLO, which showed the highest expression at 75 DAF.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;We predicted that MCAT, KASIII, FATA, SAD, FAD2, FAD3, DGAT and OLE were the key genes in the unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis and oil accumulation in herbaceous peony seed. This study provides the first comprehensive genomic resources characterizing herbaceous peony seed gene expression at the transcriptional level. These data lay the foundation for elucidating the molecular mechanisms of fatty acid biosynthesis and oil accumulation for herbaceous peony.">

The current review aims to critically summarize the literature on ethnopharmacological uses, chemical profile, and pharmacological investigations of &lt;i&gt;T. satureioides&lt;/i&gt; in order to provide data support and scientific evidences for further investigations. Electronic databases such as Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, SciFinder, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, and Medline were used to gather data on &lt;i&gt;T. satureioides&lt;/i&gt;. Chemical characterization of &lt;i&gt;T. satureioides&lt;/i&gt; essential oils (EOs) and extracts allowed to identify a total of 139 bioactive compounds, mainly belonging to the terpenoids, phenolic acids, and flavonoids classes. &lt;i&gt;T. satureioides&lt;/i&gt; especially its essential oils exhibited numerous biological activities such as antibacterial, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antidiabetic, anticancer, antiparasitic, and hypolipedemic activities. In light of these findings, further studies to transmute the traditional application of &lt;i&gt;T. satureioides&lt;/i&gt; into scientific-based information are strongly required.

        <span class="abst" title="Fragrance is an integral part of cosmetic products and is often regarded as an overriding factor in the selection of cosmetics among consumers. Fragrances also play a considerable role in masking undesirable smells arising from fatty acids, oils and surfactants that are commonly used in cosmetic formulations. Essential oils are vital assets in the cosmetic industry, as along with imparting pleasant aromas in different products, they are able to act as preservatives and active agents and, simultaneously, offer various benefits to the skin. Moreover, the stimulating demand for natural ingredients has contributed massively to a renewed interest in cosmetic and wellness industries in plant derivatives, especially essential oils. This has led popular cosmetic companies to endorse natural fragrances and opt for minimally processed natural ingredients, given the potentially adverse health risks associated with artificial fragrance chemicals, which are major elements of cosmetics. Among the high-valued essential oils used as fragrances are citrus, lavender, eucalyptus, tea tree and other floral oils, among others, while linalool, geraniol, limonene, citronellol, and citral are much-appreciated fragrance components used in different cosmetics. Thus, this review aimed to highlight the enormous versatility of essential oils as significant sources of natural fragrances in cosmetics and cosmeceuticals. Moreover, a special focus will be laid on the different aspects related to essential oils such as their sources, market demand, chemistry, fragrance classification, aroma profile, authenticity and safety.">

In fact, EO obtained from clove, oregano, thymus, cinnamon bark, rosemary, eucalyptus, and lavender have been shown to present significant inhibitory effects on bacteria, fungi, and viruses; many studies have been done to measure EO efficacy against microorganisms. The strategy of combinatory effects via conventional and non-conventional methods revealed that the combined effects of EO-EO or EO-antibiotic exhibit enhanced efficacy. This paper aims to review the antimicrobial effects of EO, modes of EO action (membrane disruption, efflux inhibition, increase membrane permeability, and decrease in intracellular ATP), and their compounds' potential as effective agents against bacteria, fungi, and viruses.

        <span class="abst" title="Anopheles stephensi with three different biotypes is a major vector of malaria in Asia. It breeds in a wide range of habitats. Therefore, safer and more sustainable methods are needed to control its immature stages rather than chemical pesticides. The larvicidal and antibacterial properties of the Pelargonium roseum essential oil (PREO) formulations were investigated against mysorensis and intermediate forms of An. stephensi in laboratory conditions. A series of nanoemulsions containing different amounts of PREO, equivalent to the calculated LC50 values for each An. stephensi form, and various quantities of surfactants and co-surfactants were developed. The physical and morphological properties of the most lethal formulations were also determined. PREO and its major components, i.e. citronellol (21.34%), L-menthone (6.41%), linalool (4.214%), and geraniol (2.19%), showed potent larvicidal activity against the studied mosquitoes. The LC50/90 values for mysorensis and intermediate forms were computed as 11.44/42.42 ppm and 12.55/47.69 ppm, respectively. The F48/F44 nanoformulations with 94% and 88% lethality for the mysorensis and intermediate forms were designated as optimized formulations. The droplet size, polydispersity index, and zeta-potential for F48/F44 were determined as 172.8/90.95 nm, 0.123/0.183, and -1.08/-2.08 mV, respectively. These results were also confirmed by TEM analysis. Prepared formulations displayed antibacterial activity against larval gut bacteria in the following order of decreasing inhibitory: LC90, optimized nanoemulsions, and LC50. PREO-based formulations were more effective against mysorensis than intermediate. Compared to the crude PREO, the overall larvicidal activity of all nanoformulations boosted by 20% and the optimized formulations by 50%. The sensitivity of insect gut bacteria may be a crucial factor in determining the outcome of the effect of toxins on target insects. The formulations designed in the present study may be a good option as a potent and selective larvicide for An. stephensi.">

This study was aimed to explore the efficacy of several Egyptian plant extracts against Toxoplasma gondii infection in vitro for future development of a new, safe, and effective compound for T. gondii. Methanol extracts from Matricaria chamomilla (German chamomile), Laurus nobilis, Citrullus colocynthis, Cinnamum camphora, Boswellia scara, and Melissa officionalis plants and oil extracts (either essential or fixed oils) of some plants such as: lemon grass (Cymbopogon citratus), marjoram (Origanum majorana), watercress (Nasturtium officionale), wheat germ (Triticum aestivum), sesame (Sesamum indicum), rosemary (Salvia rosmarinus), citronella (Cymbopogon nardus), clove (Syzygum aromaticum), jojoba (Simmondsia chinesis), and basil (Ocimum basilicum) were investigated for their anti-Toxoplasma activities. The methanol extracts from C. colocynthis and L. nobilis and the oil extracts from lemon grass and marjoram were active against T. gondii with half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) of 22.86 µg/ml, 31.35 µg/ml, 4.6 µg/ml, and 26.24 µg/ml, respectively.

Investigating the analgesic effect of the nanoemulsion, we randomly assigned 36 male rats to 6 groups: Control (saline injection into the knee), osteoarthritis (intra-articular injection of 2 mg monosodium iodoacetate), and four groups of OA treated with nanoemulsion gel, nanoemulsion solution, rosemary and peppermint essential oil gel, or diclofenac sodium. Treatments were administered topically at a dose of 1 ml daily. Using behavioral tests, we assessed pain on days 1, 4, 7, and 14 after injection. Finally, we did the histopathological and biochemical evaluation of rats' knee joints.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;There were no irritation signs on the animals' skin after receiving the nanoemulsion and no changes in the hematological and biochemical parameters of rats' blood compared to the control group. Receiving nanoemulsion decreased the mechanical (P &lt; 0.001) and thermal allodynia (P &lt; 0.05), thermal hyperalgesia (P &lt; 0.05), and ambulatory-evoked pain in comparison with the OA group. Also, the nanoemulsion receiving rats showed an increase in SOD and GPx activity and a decrease in MDA level. Histopathology of synovial tissues confirmed the results of behavioral and biochemical tests.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;The nanoemulsion containing essential oils of peppermint and rosemary reduces osteoarthritis pain via increasing antioxidant capacity and improving the histopathological features of the rats' knee joint.">

        <span class="abst" title="Control of hyperglycemia and prevention of glucose reabsorption (glucotoxicity) are important objectives in the management of type 2 diabetes. This study deals with an oral combined dosage form design for two anti-diabetic drugs, sitagliptin and dapagliflozin using self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery systems (SNEDDS). The SNEDDS were developed using naturally obtained bioactive medium-chain/long-chain triglycerides oil, mixed glycerides and nonionic surfactants, and droplet size was measured followed by the test for antioxidant activities. Equilibrium solubility and dynamic dispersion experiments were conducted to achieve the maximum drug loading. The &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; digestion, &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; bioavailability, and anti-diabetic effects were studied to compare the representative SNEDDS with marketed product Dapazin&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;. The representative SNEDDS containing black seed oil showed excellent self-emulsification performance with transparent appearance. Characterization of the SNEDDS showed nanodroplets of around 50-66.57 nm in size (confirmed by TEM analysis), in addition to the high drug loading capacity without causing any precipitation in the gastro-intestinal tract. The SNEDDS provided higher antioxidant activity compared to the pure drugs. The &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; pharmacokinetic parameters of SNEDDS showed significant increase in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt; &lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; (1.99 ± 0.21 µg mL&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;), AUC (17.94 ± 1.25 µg mL&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;), and oral absorption (2-fold) of dapagliflozin compared to the commercial product in the rat model. The anti-diabetic studies showed the significant inhibition of glucose level in treated diabetic mice by SNEDDS combined dose compared to the single drug therapy. The combined dose of sitagliptin-dapagliflozin using SNEDDS could be a potential oral pharmaceutical product for the improved treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;i&gt;Atractylodes lancea&lt;/i&gt; (AL) has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of various diseases including digestive disorders. Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a common digestive system disease with a low cure rate and easy recurrence. However, it is still not clear whether AL is suitable for UC treatment. Currently, stir-baking with wheat bran is most commonly used to process AL. Here, we aimed to address the effects of the crude and bran-processed AL on UC in vitro and uncover the underlying mechanism based on regulating the IKK/NF-kappa B signaling pathway.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;Human colonic epithelial cells (HCoEpiC) were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to mimic the inflammatory injury of UC in vitro. The essential oil from crude and bran-processed AL was used to treat LPS-induced HcoEpiC cells. The cell viability was detected by an MTT assay. The levels of IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, IL-1-&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;, TNF-&lt;i&gt;α,&lt;/i&gt; and NO were determined by ELISA, and the mRNA expressions of IKK-&lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;, NF-&lt;i&gt;κ&lt;/i&gt;B, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-&lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt; were determined by RT-PCR. Meanwhile, the expressions of IKK-&lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;, p-IKK-&lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;, p-IKK-&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;, NF-&lt;i&gt;κ&lt;/i&gt;B, IL-6, and IL-8 proteins were determined by Western blot.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The essential oil of AL, whether it was from crude or bran-processed AL, could significantly increase the viability of LPS-induced HCoEpiC cells. The treatment of AL essential oil also notably inhibited the productions of IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, IL-1-&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;, TNF-&lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;, NO, p-IKK-&lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;, p-IKK-&lt;i&gt;β,&lt;/i&gt; and NF-&lt;i&gt;κ&lt;/i&gt;B and downregulated the mRNA expressions of NF-&lt;i&gt;κ&lt;/i&gt;B, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-&lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;. Meanwhile, IL-4 protein and mRNA expression were significantly stimulated by AL essential oil. Moreover, the essential oil from bran-processed AL was more effective than that from crude AL.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;Both kinds of AL essential oil had the anti-inflammatory effect on LPS-induced HCoEpiC, and the essential oil from bran-processed AL was more effective. The mechanism could be through the IKK/NF-&lt;i&gt;κ&lt;/i&gt;B signaling pathway in vitro.">

Ecotypic oils were extracted and analyzed with the GC-MS. Their biological properties in terms of antimicrobial, antioxidant, and antigenotoxic activities were evaluated using the minimal inhibitory concentration, minimal bactericidal concentration, and DPPH, &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-carotene, and comet assays. The GC-MS results for &lt;i&gt;Thymus daenensis&lt;/i&gt; Celak oils revealed thymol (73.86%) and carvacrol (51.89%) as the most abundant components. Due to the results, reasonable bactericidal activity values range from 0.14 to 5.00 mg/ml, and fungicidal activity ranges from 0.17 to 0.58 mg/ml. The necessary oil free radical scavenging capacity (0.41-1.79 mg/ml), bleaching inhibitory activity (0.01-1.06 mg/ml), and genoprotective potential (1.04-7.78 mg/ml) indicated the dose-dependent activity. The results suggest that &lt;i&gt;Thymus daenensis&lt;/i&gt; is an important antibacterial and antifungal bioresource. Additionally, the antioxidant and radical scavenging capacity suggests this species has a role as a natural preservative in oxidative diseases and in the prevention of food spoilage.">

In view of this objective, the present study demonstrates the efficacy of lemongrass (LG) and tea tree essential oils (TTEOs) against &lt;i&gt;M. domestica&lt;/i&gt;. The TTEO proved to be more lethal against larvae and adults of &lt;i&gt;M. domestica&lt;/i&gt; depicting an LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; at 14.88 mg/ dm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; which was 17.19 mg/ dm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; for LGEO. In contrast, pupicidal effect of LGEO was much higher (LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;, 14.49 µl/0.25L) as compared to TTEO. The LGEO drastically reduced the total body sugar, glycogen and protein contents by 3.29, 2.95 and 7.56 fold, respectively, contrasting with high influence of TTEO on lipid content of the late 3rd instar larvae. A considerable reduction in gut enzymes secretion was observed due to treatment of EOs thereby altering gut physiology of the insect. Moreover, significant inhibition of acetylcholine esterase (AchE) was also observed with LGEO at LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; concentration (5.33 mg/ml) inhibiting insect neurotransmission. The gas chromatography-mass spectrometric (GC-MS) analysis of the LGEO showed 12 major compounds dominated by Citral whereas TTEO contained only 5 major compounds. Further analysis by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) revealed distortion and shrinkage of larval bodies caused by the treatment of EOs.

All the information was collected from the scientific databases.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;i&gt;Leea&lt;/i&gt; species are endemic that have opened a promising research field to identify new leads against different diseases. &lt;i&gt;Leea&lt;/i&gt; contains approximately 70 species, which are widely distributed throughout the Northern and Eastern Australia, South and Southeast Asia and parts of Africa. The &lt;i&gt;Leea&lt;/i&gt; plants are used traditionally in different ailments such as fever, diarrhea, dysentery, joint pain, rheumatism, diabetes, bone fracture, body ache, wound, sexual disorders, and so on. The majority of the &lt;i&gt;Leea&lt;/i&gt; species are the medicinal plants, which have anticancer, cytotoxic, antimicrobial, antidiabetic, hepatoprotective, cardiovascular, and CNS activity. Moreover, phytochemicals such as flavonoids, glycosides, phenols, terpenoids, steroids, volatile oils, alkaloids, proteins, quinine derivatives, tannins, saponins, and many other organic compounds have been reported in the &lt;i&gt;Leea&lt;/i&gt; species (&lt;i&gt;Leea indica&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Leea macrophylla&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Leea asiatica&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Leea aequata, Leea rubra&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Leea guineensis&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; The presence of phytochemicals and the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; biological activities reported of these plants support their use as TM. Though original research articles related to the &lt;i&gt;Leea&lt;/i&gt; genus are available, supportive reviews on phytochemicals and pharmacological activities remain scarce.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;i&gt;Leea&lt;/i&gt; species are used as TM in different ailments and have a real interest in their diverse pharmacological properties. Also, &lt;i&gt;Leea&lt;/i&gt; species contain a remarkable number of bioactive compounds. This review has provided a comprehensive report on the plants of &lt;i&gt;Leea&lt;/i&gt; genus to identify its therapeutic potential and future prospects for betterment research. However, chemical and biological investigations of several species of &lt;i&gt;Leea&lt;/i&gt; genus remain unexplored. Therefore, further studies on these species are necessary, especially regarding pharmacological properties, isolation of the compounds and mechanism of action for the development of new drugs.">

No cure exists for HSV-1 or HSV-2 infections, but antiviral medications are commonly used to prevent and treat outbreaks. Resistance to antivirals has begun to emerge, placing an importance on finding new and effective therapies for prophylaxis and treatment of HSV outbreaks. Botanicals may be effective HSV therapies as the constituents they contain act through a variety of mechanisms, potentially making the development of antiviral resistance more challenging. A wide variety of plants from different regions in the world have been studied for antiviral activity against HSV-1 and/or HSV-2 and showed efficacy of varying degrees. The purpose of this review is to summarize research conducted on whole plant extracts against HSV-1 and/or HSV-2 in vitro and in vivo. The majority of the research reviewed was conducted in vitro using animal cell lines, and some studies used an animal model design. Also summarized are a limited number of human trials conducted using botanical therapies on HSV lesions.">

        <span class="abst" title="Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infection of the respiratory system caused by single standard RNA viruses named as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease appeared as a serious problem and the leading cause of death in human beings throughout the world. The main source of different phytochemicals are plants, which helps in the development of new drugs against various ailments. Islam is comprehensive religion and a complete code of life for Muslims. The teaching of Islam, according to the Holy Quran and Hadith are universal for the benefit of humanity. Islam believes that every ailment is from God and who made the disease definitely made its medication. There is a complete guideline with regard to taking measures against infectious diseases such as quarantine and seeking medicinal treatment. The research objective is to gather the knowledge of medicinal plants described in the Holy Quran or utilized by the Prophet (SAW) for the treatment of different ailments or advised to use them to boost immunity and strengthen the body. Scientists across the globe have found these plants beneficial for many diseases and have antiviral potential. In present study, the six plant species including &lt;i&gt;Olea europaea , Nigella sativa, Allium Sativum, Allium cepa, Zingiber officinale&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Cassia senna&lt;/i&gt; were selected which contain phytochemicals like Calcium Elenolate, Thymoquinone, S-Allylcysteine, Dipropyl Disulfide, Sesquiterpene, Monoterpene, Pelargonidin 3-Galactoside ion and Kaempferol. The phytochemicals monoterpene (from &lt;i&gt;Zingiber officinale&lt;/i&gt;) shows best interaction with target proteins RdRP, 3CLPro, ACE2. Calcium Elonate (from olive) bonds with 3CLPro, ACE2 and Kemoferol and Pelargomidine (from Senna Makki) bonds with RdRP, ACE2. The ligands show a unique set of intersections i.e. hydrogen bonding, and alkyl interaction. These medicinal plants can be utilized immediately for the treatment of COVID-19 as their safety is already established. This treatment can enhance recovery when combined with other treatments. Furthermore, the screening of bioactive compounds or phytochemicals found in these plants can be utilized to design new therapeutic drug to treat COVID-19 pandemic.">

        <span class="abst" title="The parasitic diseases represent the most important health risk, especially in underdeveloped countries where they have a deep impact on public health. Trichomoniasis is a prevalent non-viral sexually transmitted disease, and a significant amount of new cases are identified each year globally. Furthermore, the infection is linked with serious concerns such as pregnancy outcomes, infertility, predisposition to cervical and prostate cancer, and increased transmission and acquisition of HIV. The therapy is restricted, adverse effects are often observed, and resistance to the drugs is emerging. Based on this, a new treatment for trichomoniasis is necessary. Natural products represent a rich source of bioactive compounds, and even today, they are used in the search for new drugs. Additionally, natural products provide a wide variety of leadership structures that can be used by the pharmaceutical industry as a template in the development of new drugs that are more effective and have fewer or no undesirable side effects compared to current treatments. This review focuses on the medicinal plants that possess anti-trichomonal activity in vitro or in vivo. An electronic database search was carried out covering the last three decades, i.e., 1990-2020. The literature search revealed that almost a dozen isolated phytoconstituents are being explored globally for their anti-trichomonal activity. Simultaneously, many countries have their own traditional or folk medicine for trichomoniasis that utilizes their native plants, as a whole, or even extracts. This review focuses mainly on the human parasite Trichomonas vaginalis. However, at some points mention is also made to Tritrichomonas foetus that causes trichomoniasis in animals of high veterinary and economical interest. We will focus on the plants and plant-based compounds and their anti-trichomonal activity. The literature search highlighted that there are abundant compounds that possess anti-trichomonal activity; however, in-depth in-vivo evaluation of compounds and their clinical evaluation has not been undertaken. There is a critical need for new anti-trichomonal compounds, and focused research on phytoconstituents can provide the way forward.">

The LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; (lethal concentration to kill 50% of tested insects) values of the oral and fumigant bioassays of &lt;i&gt;A. annua&lt;/i&gt; essential oil were 1.204 % W/V and 3.343 μL/L air, respectively. The &lt;i&gt;A. annua&lt;/i&gt; essential oil&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; rich in camphor, artemisia ketone, β-selinene, pinocarvone, 1,8-cineole, and α-pinene, caused a significant reduction in digestive and detoxifying enzyme activity of &lt;i&gt;G. pyloalis&lt;/i&gt; larvae. The contents of protein, glucose, and triglyceride were also reduced in the treated larvae by oral and fumigant treatments. The immune system in treated larvae was weakened after both oral and fumigation applications compared to the control groups. Histological studies on the midgut and ovaries showed that &lt;i&gt;A. annua&lt;/i&gt; essential oil caused an obvious change in the distribution of the principal cells of tissues and reduction in yolk spheres in oocytes. Therefore, it is suggested that the essential oil from &lt;i&gt;A. annua&lt;/i&gt; flowers, with wide-range bio-effects on &lt;i&gt;G. pyloalis&lt;/i&gt;, be used as an available, safe, effective insecticide in the protection of mulberry.">

The southeastern United States also possesses a warm humid climate with a growing demand for locally sourced herbs and spices. In this study, five different varieties of &lt;i&gt;C. longa&lt;/i&gt; were cultivated in north Alabama, the rhizome essential oils obtained by hydrodistillation, and the essential oils were analyzed by gas chromatographic techniques. The major components in the essential oils were α-phellandrene (3.7-11.8%), 1,8-cineole (2.6-11.7%), α-zingiberene (0.8-12.5%), β-sesquiphellandrene (0.7-8.0%), &lt;i&gt;ar&lt;/i&gt;-turmerone (6.8-32.5%), α-turmerone (13.6-31.5%), and β-turmerone (4.8-18.4%).

Up to today, there was no scientific report on wound healing activity. Thus, this study was initiated to evaluate for the first time the antimicrobial activity and wound healing potential of a new chemotype from &lt;i&gt;Piper cubeba&lt;/i&gt; essential oil (PCEO) from fruits. Thirteen microbial strains have been selected to investigate the antimicrobial potential of PCEO. For the evaluation of the wound healing potential, sixteen rats were excised on the dorsal back and divided into four groups. The effect of PCEO on the malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities in the healed wound area of rats and the biochemical parameters and skin histological analysis were also assessed. Results: Data showed that PCEO exhibited a powerful antimicrobial potential especially against &lt;i&gt;Listeria monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;. In addition, the topical application of PCEO cream appears to increase the SOD level, wound healing and contraction but reduced the MDA amount suggesting an impressive and a rapid cutaneous healing power. Additionally, histopathological analysis of the granulation tissue revealed that the derma is properly restored and arranged after treatment with PCEO. The docking analysis of PCEO constituents against &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt; tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase enzyme showed binding energies values in the range of -7.2 to -4.8 kcal/mol. In conclusion, the topic use of PCEO healing cream showed significant effect in accelerating the healing process, which may be attributed to the synergetic effect of antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of PCEO volatile constituents, making it a relevant therapeutic agent for the management of wounds and therefore confirming the popular traditional uses of this plant.">

To determine the main compounds in these essential oils that might be responsible for this antifungal activity, they were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). &lt;i&gt;C. citratus&lt;/i&gt; essential oil showed cirtal as its main constituent, while &lt;i&gt;L. dentata&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;L. nobilis&lt;/i&gt; essential oils showed eucalyptol.

It significantly reduced the accumulated lipids through lipolysis performed at 10 ug/mL in 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cells. NE suppresses the differentiation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes and lowers triglycerides. Further, the substantial reduction of lipid content is evident with Oil Red O staining and OD measurement. In this present study, the synergetic effect of DM-ZnO NPs and tryptophan is reported, which provides a way for more detailed research on its efficacy for obesity and obesity-associated disorders.">

The present study aimed to evaluate the chemical composition and apoptotic activity of &lt;i&gt;Ferula macrecolea&lt;/i&gt; essential oil (FMEO) as well as its in vitro and ex vivo protoscolicidal effects against hydatid cyst protoscoleces.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis was performed to determine the chemical composition of FMEO. Protoscoleces of hydatid cysts were collected from liver fertile hydatid cysts of infected sheep and were then treated with various concentrations of the essential oil (75, 150, and 300 µL/mL) for 5-60 min in vitro and ex vivo. Then, by using the eosin exclusion test, the viability of the protoscoleces was studied. The caspase-3-like activity of the FMEO-treated protoscoleces was also evaluated through the colorimetric protease assay Sigma Kit based on the manufacturer's instructions.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;According to GC/MS, the main constituents of the essential oil were terpinolene (77.72%), n-nonanal (4.47%), and linalool (4.35%), respectively. In vitro, the maximum protoscolicidal activity of FMEO was observed at the concentrations of 150 and 300 µL/mL, such that 100% of the protoscoleces were killed after 30 and 20 min of exposure, respectively. Based on the obtained findings, the results demonstrate that FMEO required a longer time to kill protoscoleces ex vivo; after 12 min of exposure to FMEO, only 13.4% of the protoscoleces remained alive. After 48 h of the treatment of protoscoleces, FMEO, in a dose-dependent manner and at doses of 75, 150, and 300 µL/mL, induced the activation of the caspase enzyme by 24.3, 35.3, and 48.3%, respectively.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;Our findings demonstrate the potent protoscolicidal effects of FMEO in vitro and ex vivo; however, further studies are required to assess the safety and the efficiency of FMEO as a promising scolicidal agent in a preclinical model and clinical setting.">

For centuries, it has been used as a system of Ayurvedic and Unani medicine and has a wide range of nutritional and bioactive compounds, including proteins, essential amino acids, carbohydrates, lipids, fibre, vitamins, minerals, phenolic compounds, phytosterols and others. These characteristics allow it to have pharmacological properties, including anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory, anticarcinogenic, antioxidant, cardioprotective, antimicrobial and hepatoprotective properties. The entire &lt;i&gt;Moringa oleifera&lt;/i&gt; plant is edible, including its flowers, however, it is not entirely safe, because of compounds that have been found mainly in the root and bark, so the leaf was identified as the safest. &lt;i&gt;Moringa oleifera&lt;/i&gt; is recognised as an excellent source of phytochemicals, with potential applications in functional and medicinal food preparations due to its nutritional and medicinal properties; many authors have experimented with incorporating it mainly in biscuits, cakes, brownies, meats, juices and sandwiches. The results are fascinating, as the products increase their nutritional value; however, the concentrations cannot be high, as this affects the organoleptic characteristics of the supplemented products. The aim of this study is to review the application of &lt;i&gt;Moringa oleifera&lt;/i&gt; in bakery products, which will allow the creation of new products that improve their nutritional and functional value.">

Different health benefits are attributed to the guaviduca beverage, which is consumed as a traditional and folk medicine. In this study, fresh &lt;i&gt;P. carpunya&lt;/i&gt; leaves were collected in the winter and summer and subjected to hydrodistillation for the extraction of the essential oil. The guaviduca beverage was prepared by infusion in water and the volatile compounds were isolated by liquid-liquid extraction. Chemical composition and enantioselective analyses were performed by gas chromatography. The antibacterial activity was assayed against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The scavenging radical properties of the essential oil was evaluated by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydryl (DPPH) and 2,2'-azinobis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) assays. The acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity was measured using the spectrophotometric method. The chemical analysis allowed us to identify more than 98% of the compounds in all samples. The main constituent of the essential oil was 1,8-cineole (25.20 ± 1.31%) in &lt;i&gt;P. carpunya&lt;/i&gt; collected in winter and (17.45 ± 2.33%) in &lt;i&gt;P. carpunya&lt;/i&gt; collected in summer, while in the beverage, there was 14 mg/L. Safrole was identified in the essential oil (PCW 21.91 ± 2.79%; PCS 13.18 ± 1.72%) as well as in the beverage (2.43 ± 0.12 mg/L). Enantioselective analysis was used to investigate the enantiomeric ratio and excess of four chiral components. The essential oil presented a strong activity against &lt;i&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; with a MIC of 500 μg/mL and a very strong anticholinesterase activity with an IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of 36.42 ± 1.15 µg/mL.">

Previous studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is much similar to the SARS-CoV bat that occurred in 2002-03. Since it is a zoonotic virus, the exact source is still unknown, but it is believed bats may be the primary reservoir of SARS-CoV-2 through which it has been transferred to humans. In this review, we have tried to summarize some of the approaches that could be effective against SARS-CoV-2. Firstly, plants or plant-based products have been effective against different viral diseases, and secondly, plants or plant-based natural products have the minimum adverse effect.

The chemical composition of essential oils was determined by GC-MS and GC-FID, while extracts (phenolic acids and flavonoids fractions) were analyzed by HPLC-DAD. Based on given volatiles, the investigated subspecies represented two chemotypes: a carvacrol/γ-terpinene/&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-cymene type in the case of Greek oregano and a sabinyl/cymyl type rich in terpinen-4-ol in common oregano. Within non-volatile phenolic compounds, rosmarinic acid appeared to dominate in both subspecies. Lithospermic acid B, chlorogenic acid and isovitexin were present only in Greek oregano extracts. However, the total content of flavonoids was higher in common oregano extracts. The essential oil and extract of Greek oregano revealed visibly stronger antibacterial activity (expressed as MIC and MBC) than common oregano, whereas the antioxidant potential (determined by DPPH, ABTS and FRAP) of these extracts was almost equal for both subspecies. In the case of &lt;i&gt;Origanum&lt;/i&gt; plants, the potential application of essential oils and extracts as antiseptic and antioxidant agents in the food industry should be preceded by subspecies identification followed by recognition of their chemotype concerning both terpene and phenolics composition.">

        <span class="abst" title="The leaves of &lt;i&gt;Homalomena aromatica&lt;/i&gt; are traditionally used in Bangladesh for the treatment of different chronic ailments. The purpose of this study was to explore in vitro antioxidant, thrombolytic activities, and in vivo neuropharmacological effects of methanolic extract of &lt;i&gt;Homalomena aromatica&lt;/i&gt; (MEHA) leaves. Antioxidant activity of MEHA was assessed by a DPPH free radical scavenging assay and total phenolics content, total flavonoids content were also measured. The thrombolytic activity was determined by percentage of clot lysis and neuropharmacological activities by hole board, tail suspension, forced swimming and elevated plus maze tests. The results showed that the IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value of the extract against DPPH was 199.51 μg/mL. Quantitative analysis displayed higher contents of phenolics and flavonoids (147.71 mg gallic acid equivalent/g &amp; 66.65 mg quercetin equivalent/g dried extract, respectively). The extract also showed a significant clot lysis (33.31%) activity. In case of anxiolytic activity, the elevate plus maze (EPM) test demonstrated an increase in time spent in open arms, and in case of hole board test, the number of head dipping was also significantly increased (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05). All the test compared with control (1% Tween in water) and standard (diazepam 1 mg/kg), significant dose (200 &amp; 400 mg/kg) dependent anxiolytic activity was found. In antidepressant activity, there was a significant decrease in period of immobility in both test models (tail suspension and forced swimming) (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05). Moreover, 13 compounds were identified as bioactive, showed good binding affinities to xanthine oxidoreductase, tissue plasminogen activator receptor, potassium channel receptor, human serotonin receptor targets in molecular docking experiments. Furthermore, ADME/T analysis revealed their drug-likeness, likely pharmacological actions and non-toxic upon consumption. Taken together, our finding support the traditional medicinal use of this plant, which may provide a potential source for future drug discovery.">

Leaves of the mango plant have been studied for their health benefits, which are attributed to a plethora of phytochemicals such as mangiferin, followed by phenolic acids, benzophenones, and other antioxidants such as flavonoids, ascorbic acid, carotenoids, and tocopherols. The extracts from mango leaves (MLs) have been studied for their biological activities, including anti-cancer, anti-diabetic, anti-oxidant, anti-microbial, anti-obesity, lipid-lowering, hepato-protection, and anti-diarrheal. In the present review, we have elaborated on the nutritional and phytochemical profile of the MLs. Further, various bioactivities of the ML extracts are also critically discussed. Considering the phytochemical profile and beneficial effects of the MLs, they can be used as a potential ingredient for the development of functional foods and pharmaceutical drugs. However, more detailed clinical trials still needed to be conducted for establishing the actual efficacy of the ML extracts.">

Results of oregano and thyme EOs combination showed additive effects against all &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt; strains in both phases. In several cases, sums of FICs were lower than 0.6, which can be considered a strong additive interaction. The lowest FICs obtained were 0.53 in the liquid phase and 0.59 in the gaseous phase.

        <span class="abst" title="Essential oils (EOs) are known to have varying degrees of antimicrobial properties that are mainly due to the presence of bioactive compounds. These include antiviral, nematicidal, antifungal, insecticidal and antioxidant properties. This review highlights the potential of EOs and their compounds for application as antifungal agents for the treatment of skin diseases via conventional and nonconventional approaches. A search was conducted using three databases (Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar), and all relevant articles from the period of 2010-2020 that are freely available in English were extracted. In our findings, EOs with a high percentage of monoterpenes showed strong ability as potential antifungal agents. &lt;i&gt;Lavandula&lt;/i&gt; sp., &lt;i&gt;Salvia&lt;/i&gt; sp., &lt;i&gt;Thymus&lt;/i&gt; sp., &lt;i&gt;Citrus&lt;/i&gt; sp., and &lt;i&gt;Cymbopogon&lt;/i&gt; sp. were among the various species found to show excellent antifungal properties against various skin diseases. Some researchers developed advanced formulations such as gel, semi-solid, and ointment bases to further evaluate the effectiveness of EOs as antifungal agents. To date, most studies on the application of EOs as antifungal agents were performed using in vitro techniques, and only a limited number pursued in vivo and intervention-based research.">

        <span class="abst" title="The cannabis plant (&lt;i&gt;Cannabis sativa&lt;/i&gt; L.) produces an estimated 545 chemical compounds of different biogenetic classes. In addition to economic value, many of these phytochemicals have medicinal and physiological activity. The plant is most popularly known for its two most-prominent and most-studied secondary metabolites-Δ&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;-THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). Both Δ&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;-THC and CBD have a wide therapeutic window across many ailments and form part of a class of secondary metabolites called cannabinoids-of which approximately over 104 exist. This review will focus on non-cannabinoid metabolites of &lt;i&gt;Cannabis sativa&lt;/i&gt; that also have therapeutic potential, some of which share medicinal properties similar to those of cannabinoids. The most notable of these non-cannabinoid phytochemicals are flavonoids and terpenes. We will also discuss future directions in cannabis research and development of cannabis-based pharmaceuticals. Caflanone, a flavonoid molecule with selective activity against the human viruses including the coronavirus OC43 (HCov-OC43) that is responsible for COVID-19, and certain cancers, is one of the most promising non-cannabinoid molecules that is being advanced into clinical trials. As validated by thousands of years of the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes, vast anecdotal evidence abounds on the medicinal benefits of the plant. These benefits are attributed to the many phytochemicals in this plant, including non-cannabinoids. The most promising non-cannabinoids with potential to alleviate global disease burdens are discussed.">

        <span class="abst" title="Medicinal plants and their derived compounds have drawn the attention of researchers due to their considerable impact on human health. Among medicinal plants, mint (&lt;i&gt;Mentha&lt;/i&gt; species) exhibits multiple health beneficial properties, such as prevention from cancer development and anti-obesity, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, and cardioprotective effects, as a result of its antioxidant potential, combined with low toxicity and high efficacy. &lt;i&gt;Mentha&lt;/i&gt; species are widely used in savory dishes, food, beverages, and confectionary products. Phytochemicals derived from mint also showed anticancer activity against different types of human cancers such as cervix, lung, breast and many others. Mint essential oils show a great cytotoxicity potential, by modulating MAPK and PI3k/Akt pathways; they also induce apoptosis, suppress invasion and migration potential of cancer cells lines along with cell cycle arrest, upregulation of Bax and p53 genes, modulation of TNF, IL-6, IFN-γ, IL-8, and induction of senescence phenotype. Essential oils from mint have also been found to exert antibacterial activities against &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt;, and many others.

Scientific data supporting the efficacy of EOs as anti-inflammatory, antibacterial and antioxidant molecules accumulates over time; however, the cumulative evidence is not always sufficient. EOs antioxidant properties have been investigated mainly from human perspectives. Still, so far, our review is the first to combine the beneficial supporting properties of EOs in a One Health approach and as an animal product quality enhancer, opening new possibilities for their utilization in the livestock and nutrition sectors. We aim to compile the currently available data on the main anti-inflammatory effects of EOs, whether encapsulated or not, with a focus on mammary gland inflammation. We will also review the EOs' antioxidant activities when given in the diet or as a food preservative to counteract oxidative stress. We emphasize EOs' in vitro and in vivo ruminal microbiota and mechanisms of action to promote animal health and performance. Given the concept of DOHaD (Developmental Origin of Health and Diseases), supplementing animals with EOs in early life opens new perspectives in the nutrition sector. However, effective evaluation of the significant safety components is required before extending their use to livestock and veterinary medicine.">

Thirteen other known compounds involving allantoin (1) were either isolated or identified. GC-MS enabled the identification of six compounds from a fraction containing essential oil. MeOH extract and some isolated compounds were tested in vitro against Pf7G8 CQS and Pf Dd2 CQR strains of Plasmodium falciparum; extract disclosed a moderate antiplasmodial activity (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 50 μg mL&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;). Meantime, the CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; extract and essential oil fraction were tested on a resistant mycobacterial strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis; a potent antimycobacterial activity with a MIC = 9.52 μg mL&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; was deduced from essential oil. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried on batesiin (2). Calculated chemical shifts at B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) and MPW1PW91/6-31G+(d,p) showed much better correlations with the experimental data. Time dependent DFT at B3LYP/6-31G+(d,p) displayed a major absorption band 3.01 nm higher than the experimental value.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;Cordia batesii can be considered as promising in search of compounds with antimalarial and antitubercular properties. DFT studies are very helpful when trying to learn more about the spectroscopic insights of a derivative of allantoin (1).">

A total of six hundred 1-day-old male broiler chickens were randomly allocated into 5 treatment groups with 8 replicate pens, and each pen contained 15 birds. The experiment lasted for 42 d. Dietary treatments included corn-soybean meal-based diet supplemented with 0, 250, 500, 750, and 1,000 mg/kg EEO. The results indicated that dietary treatments had no effect on growth performance parameters in the 1 to 10 d period. From day 11 to 24, dietary supplementation of EEO showed a linear decrease in feed conversion ratio (FCR, P &lt; 0.05). From day 25 to 42 and the overall period (1-42 d), broilers fed with different levels of EEO showed a linear increase in body weight gain (BWG) and reduction in feed conversion ratio (linear, P &lt; 0.05). The relative organ weight were unaffected by any of the dietary treatments. With increasing levels of EEO, the cecal Escherichia coli (linear, P = 0.085) count showed a trend in reduction, and the cecal lactic acid bacteria population tended to increase (linear, P = 0.063). The apparent ileal digestibility of ether extract and organic matter were linearly and quadratically increased in response to increasing dietary EEO supplementation (P &lt; 0.05). A trend of linear decrease in total cholesterol in the serum of birds fed with different levels of EEO was recorded (P = 0.074). Eucalyptus essential oil's inclusion increased serum superoxide dismutase linearly but reduced serum malondialdehyde linearly (P &lt; 0.05). Dietary supplementation of EEO affected the fatty acid profile of thigh muscle so that increased the concentrations of total polyunsaturated fatty acids (linear, P &lt; 0.05) and reduced total saturated fatty acid contents (linear, P &lt; 0.05). Taken together, the inclusion of EEO increased BWG and decreased FCR during day 25 to 42 and day 1 to 42, and partially improved cecal microflora balance, nutrient digestibility, antioxidant activity, and thigh muscle fatty acid profile in broiler chickens.">

The present paper reviews advances in research relating to the botany, ethnopharmacology, phytochemistry, pharmacology, and toxicology of Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens. In addition, this review also discusses some significant issues and the potential direction of future research on Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens. More than 100 chemical compounds have been isolated from Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens, including gingerols, essential oils, diarylheptanoids, and other compounds. Modern studies have confirmed that Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens has pharmacological effects on the nervous system and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular systems, as well as antiemetic, antibacterial, antitumor, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects. However, the modern studies of Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens are still not complete and more bioactive components and potential pharmacological effects need to be explored in the future. There is no unified standard to evaluate the quality and clinical efficacy of Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens. Therefore, we should establish reasonable, accurate, and reliable quality control standards to make better use of Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens.">

One or many of these compounds have antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, antispasmodic, anti-septic, anti-cancer, anti-ulcer, antimicrobial, antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, anti-diabetic, anti-fertility, diaphoretics, anticutaneous, anticatarrhal, antirheumatic, anti-ulcer, gastroprotective, immunomodulatory, analgesic, and antiviral activity.&lt;h4&gt;Short conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hyptis suaveolens&lt;/i&gt; contains unique terpenoid metabolites like suaveolic acid, suaveolol, methyl suaveolate, beta-sitosterol, ursolic acid, and phenolic compound like rosamarinic acid, methyl rosamarinate that have potentiality to substitute the traditional drugs as therapeutic agent against the resistant and newly emerged bacterial and viral pathogens. Pentacyclic triterpenoid, ursolic acid have been reported to have effective antiviral response against the SARS-CoV2 responsible for the present COVID-19 pandemic and HIV virus for which no effective vaccines are available till date. Ursolic acid has the ability to modulate the activity of main protease (M&lt;sup&gt;pro&lt;/sup&gt;) that is essential for processing of SARS-CoV2 replicase-transcriptase machinery needed for viral replication and particle assembly.">

In different countries, it is utilized as food, medicine, an essential oil source, and the industrial component to other products. In Ethiopia, it was one of the most known and very important plants for a long period of time. It was utilized as food, a medicinal plant, and animal feed. It was also one of the most economically important and culturally valuable plants. But nowadays, it is not adequately available in the country due to deforestation problem in the years. In addition, its economic importance, current status, and medicinal roles are not well documented and understood. As for research studies, it is concluded that unless a collective effort is taken, the existence of this plant is under severe threat and needs to have some measures. This review article is aimed at addressing the abovelined topics in detail and to pinpoint and explain the importance and status of &lt;i&gt;Ximenia americana&lt;/i&gt;.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;There is a worldwide interest in the use of Cannabis sativa for biomedicine purposes. Cannabis has ethnomedicinal usage as a natural medicine in Bangladesh and cultivated during the British Empire period for revenues.&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;Folk medicine practitioners (FMPs) from different districts of Bangladesh have been using Cannabis sativa, but until now there have not been any compiled studies particularly regarding this practice. Hence, this review is an effort to retrieve the traditional usage of Cannabis sativa as a phytomedicine from published ethnomedicinal studies.&lt;h4&gt;Methods and materials&lt;/h4&gt;Information was searched by using the search terms &quot;ethnomedicinal Cannabis sativa and Bangladesh&quot;; &quot;Bangladesh cannabaceae and ethnomedicinal survey&quot;; &quot;ganja, bhang and folk medicine Bangladesh&quot;; &quot;tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabinoid and therapeutic, clinical trial&quot;; and &quot;cannabis and pharmacological/biological&quot; and retrieved from ethnobotanical articles available on PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, and Google Scholar databases. A search of the relevant scientific literature also was conducted to assess the efficacy of the ethnomedicinal usage of Cannabis sativa.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;While reviewing over 200 ethnomedicinal plants' survey articles, we found that FMPs of Bangladesh from 12 different districts used Cannabis sativa to treat cited ailments like sleep-associated problems (n=5), neuropsychiatric and CNS problems (n=5), and infections and respiratory problems (n=5) followed by rheumatism, gastrointestinal, gynecological (n=4 each), cancer, sexual, and other ailments including hypertension, headache, itch, increases bile secretion, abortifacient, dandruff, fever, and urinary problems (n=1 each). There are a total of 15 formulations identified from the 11 out of 18 ethnomedicinal plant survey reports. The leaf was the main plant part used (53.8%), followed by root (23%), seed (7.7%) and flower, inflorescence, resin, and all parts 3.8% respectively.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;Sales and cultivation of Cannabis are illegal at present in Bangladesh, but the use of Cannabis sativa as a natural phytomedicine has been practiced traditionally by folk medicine practitioners of Bangladesh for many years and validated through relevant pharmacological justification. Although Cannabis sativa possesses ethnomedicinal properties in the folk medicine of Bangladesh, it is, furthermore, needed to conduct biological research to consolidate pharmacological justification about the prospects and challenges of Cannabis and cannabinoids' use in Bangladesh as safer biomedicine in the future.">
