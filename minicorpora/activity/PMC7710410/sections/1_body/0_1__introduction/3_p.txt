0: The study of tobacco oil properties using gas chromatography method allows to define exactly the fatty acid composition of tobacco oil [ 14,  15].
1: Tobacco seed is a byproduct from tobacco in which yield is around 12001250 kg per hectare area, while in the USA, it is twice less.
2: But it is easily possible to get up to 5.0006.000 kg per hectare area, if selection prefers seeds, not leafs.
3: Our field studies also grow tobacco at much higher densities than those used for leaf production, in attempt to shift the emphasis from leaf to seed development by cultural practices.
4: Improvements through conventional breeding, genetic engineering, and low input agronomic practices are transforming tobacco into a high-yielding new oil crop.
5: It is free of nicotine, and its oil has a low proportion of saturated fatty acids and contains health-beneficial compounds such as tocopherols and sterols.
