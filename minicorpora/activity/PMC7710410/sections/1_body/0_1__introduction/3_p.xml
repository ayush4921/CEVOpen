<p>The study of tobacco oil properties using gas chromatography method allows to define exactly the fatty acid composition of tobacco oil [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Tobacco seed is a byproduct from tobacco in which yield is around 1200–1250 kg per hectare area, while in the USA, it is twice less. But it is easily possible to get up to 5.000–6.000 kg per hectare area, if selection prefers seeds, not leafs. Our field studies also grow tobacco at much higher densities than those used for leaf production, in attempt to shift the emphasis from leaf to seed development by cultural practices. Improvements through conventional breeding, genetic engineering, and low input agronomic practices are transforming tobacco into a high-yielding new oil crop. It is free of nicotine, and its oil has a low proportion of saturated fatty acids and contains health-beneficial compounds such as tocopherols and sterols.
