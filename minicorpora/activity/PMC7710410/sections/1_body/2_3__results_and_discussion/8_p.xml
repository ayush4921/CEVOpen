<p>The high level of unsaturated fat, tocopherol, and phospholipid, significant amount of antioxidants, and effect on growth inhibition of cancer cells indicated that the high-yield tobacco seed oil may be obtained with special fatty acid composition or other beneficial components and serve as edible oil. The tobacco seed flours may provide dietary sources of natural antioxidants and contain antiproliferative components. Development of health products from these flours and oils has the potential to be excellent alternative uses of Kazakhstan grown tobacco. The results of this research may also be applicable to tobaccos growing in other countries. Additional research is still required to further investigate the effects of food formulation, processing, and storage on the availability of these beneficial components and properties, as well as the phytochemical components and biochemical mechanisms involved in antiproliferative properties, in order to better utilize the oil and flour for health promotion and disease prevention.</p>
