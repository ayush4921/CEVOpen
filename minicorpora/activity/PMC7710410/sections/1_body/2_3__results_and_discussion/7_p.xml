<p>High levels of unsaturated fats, tocopherol, and phospholipids, a significant amount of antioxidants, and the effect on the growth of cancer cells indicate that high-yielding tobacco seed oil can be obtained with a special fatty acid composition or other useful components and serve as the basis for creating perfumes, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals. Tobacco seed oil can serve as a source of natural antioxidants and contain antiproliferative components. The development of perfumes, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals for health from these oils has the potential to become an excellent alternative to the use of tobacco grown in Kazakhstan. The results of this study may also be applicable to tobacco cultivation in other countries. Additional research is needed to further investigate the effects of tobacco seed oil formulation, processing, and storage on the availability of beneficial components and properties, as well as phytochemical components and biochemical mechanisms involved in antiproliferative properties, in order to better use the oil for health promotion and disease prevention.</p>
