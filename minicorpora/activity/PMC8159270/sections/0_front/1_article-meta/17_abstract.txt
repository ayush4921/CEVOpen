0: AbstractContextProcessing with vinegar could enhance the efficacy and reduce the toxicity of    Curcuma phaeocaulis Valeton.
1: (Zingiberaceae), a Chinese herbal medicine with anti-inflammatory and antitumor activities.
2: ObjectiveThis study investigated the vinegar processing effects by evaluating anti-angiogenic effect and toxicity of    C. phaeocaulis through zebrafish and rat models.
3: Materials and methodsZebrafish embryos (AB and FLk-GFP strain) were applied to evaluate toxicity, cardiotoxicity and anti-angiogenic activity of volatile oil, and water decoction of the raw and vinegar-processed    C.    phaeocaulis.
4: Meanwhile, a blood stasis syndrome rat model was applied to study the toxicity by measuring the ovarian and uterine coefficient.
5: ResultsCurcuma phaeocaulis volatile oil and its vinegar-processed products in zebrafish had an LC   50 of 67.315 and 95.755 g/mL, respectively.
6: Curcuma phaeocaulis water decoction and its vinegar-processed products had an LC   50 of 161.440 and 206.239 g/mL, respectively.
7: The toxicity of vinegar-processed products was significantly lower than the raw, and the development characteristic of zebrafish embryos at different times confirmed these results.
8: The volatile oil of vinegar-processed products could inhibit the growth of intersegmental blood vessels at the dose of 20 g/mL, while the raw materials did not exhibit such effect at the same concentration.
9: The rat experiment also confirmed that the volatile oil could reduce toxicity of ovarian and uterine.
10: Discussion and conclusionsThe study indicated that processing using vinegar could decrease toxicity and increase anti-angiogenic activity of    C. phaeocaulis, which could be applied for clinical treatment.
11: Further in-depth study on the synergism and detoxification mechanism of vinegar processing technology is needed.
