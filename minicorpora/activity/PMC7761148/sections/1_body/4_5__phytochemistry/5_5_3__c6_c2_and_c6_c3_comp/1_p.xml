<p>A variety of C6â€“C3 phenolic acids have been identified in different studies. Among the most important are the caffeoylquinic derivatives (chlorogenic acid, but also 5-

 <italic>O</italic>-caffeoylquinic, 3,4-di-
 <italic>O</italic>-caffeoylquinic, 4,5-di-
 <italic>O</italic>-caffeoylquinic acids, methyl 3,5-di-
 <italic>O</italic>-caffeoylquinate, and 3,4,5-tri-
 <italic>O</italic>-caffeoylquinic acid, the latter showing superior anti-inflammatory effects over the di-caffeoylquinic derivatives.) [

 <xref rid="B87-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Chlorogenic acid content may vary considerably, as shown in one study that measured it in samples collected from 20 sites, which found concentrations as low as 158.99 mg/100 g and as high as 441.50 mg/kg [
 <xref rid="B59-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Similarly, rosmarinic acid varied in the same study between 256.38 mg/100 g and 898.70 mg/100 g [
 <xref rid="B59-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], whereas (as mentioned) in a different study, it could not be detected at all [

 <xref rid="B88-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>], a number of variables, such as the herbal part, ontogenetic development stage, and ambient conditions have a considerable influence on the qualitative and quantitative content in phenolic compounds of the species.
