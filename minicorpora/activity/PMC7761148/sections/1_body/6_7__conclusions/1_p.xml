 <italic>S. virgaurea</italic> L. is a native species in Europe, with a long tradition of medicinal use for a variety of therapeutic purposes in different geographical reasons: urinary tract conditions, gastro-intestinal conditions, diabetes, allergies, as well as for healing and antiseptic purposes. The largest body of research has been limited to non-clinical experiments up to date, having a wide variability with respect to design, methodological quality, and evidence strength. Many of the relevant studies have been performed before 2000, published in other languages than English, and are not easily accessible today. Clinical investigation has been very limited in scope and volume, and the little clinical data available are not of the highest quality (no clinical randomized, controlled, double-blind study has been published thus far). Whereas some of the pharmacological activities have not been promising (e.g., the antibacterial, antifungal, or cytotoxic effects seem rather modest), others seem more interesting and invite to further research (e.g., antiadipogenic, antisenescence, or the beneficial effects in dysuria and overactive/irritable bladder).
