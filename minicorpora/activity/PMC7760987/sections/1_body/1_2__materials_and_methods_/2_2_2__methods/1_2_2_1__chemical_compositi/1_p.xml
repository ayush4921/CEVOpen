<p>The chemical composition of the copaiba oil was determined in a gas chromatograph coupled with mass spectrometry (CG-EM, GCMS-QP2010 Ultra, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan), using a capillary column DB-5 (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm), programmed at an initial temperature of 50 °C, increasing at a rate of 3 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup>, up to 280 °C. The flow rate of the carrier gas was 1.0 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup>. Analyzes were performed with the injector temperature at 220 °C and the detector temperature at 290 °C, using an injection volume of 1 µL, in 1:10 split mode. For the sample preparation, the oil was diluted in n-hexane (100 µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>). The calculated retention index (CI) was determined using the linear alkanes standard (C7-C40, Sigma Aldrich, 98%), and the identification of the compounds was obtained by comparing the CI with the literature retention index (LI) [
