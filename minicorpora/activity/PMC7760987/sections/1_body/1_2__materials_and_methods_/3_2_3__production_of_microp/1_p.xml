<p>The microparticles were produced by complex coacervation based on the methodology proposed by Alvim and Grosso [
 <xref rid="B30-polymers-12-02883" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Initially, 5 g of copaiba oil was homogenized in Ultra-Turrax (IKA, T25 Digital Ultra-Turrax, Staufen, Germany), at 14.000 rpm for 3 min, in 100 mL of gelatin solution (2.5 g of gelatin/100 mL of distilled water) at 45 °C (IKA, C-MAG HS7, Staufen, Germany). Then, 100 mL of gum arabic solution (2.5 g of gum arabic/100 mL of distilled water) was added to the emulsion under magnetic stirring at 250 rpm for 10 min with the same temperature. Subsequently, 400 mL of distilled water (45 °C) was added and the mixture remained under magnetic stirring for 5 min. The pH was then adjusted to 4.0 using hydrochloric acid solution (2.7 M) and the mixture was cooled under magnetic stirring for 1 h, using an ice bath (until reaching 10 ± 2 °C). Subsequently, the mixture was kept at 4 °C overnight (5 ± 2 °C) for a complete precipitation of the microparticles. These were separated from the solution using a Tyler 200 mesh sieve and stored in glass flasks at −22 °C.
