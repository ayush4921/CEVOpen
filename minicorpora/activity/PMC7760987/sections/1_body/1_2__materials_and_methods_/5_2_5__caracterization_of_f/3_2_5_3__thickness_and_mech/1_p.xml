<p>Thickness was determined using a digital micrometer (Mitutoyo, Absolute, Interface IT-016U, Kawasaki, Japan) performing 10 random measurements in the films. The tensile strength (TS) and elongation (E) were determined using a texturometer (Stable Microsysems SMD, TA XT2, Godalming, UK) according to ASTM D882-10 [
 <xref rid="B34-polymers-12-02883" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Film samples (100 mm × 25 mm) were positioned between the claws (100 mm apart) with a test speed of 10 mm s
 <sup>−1</sup>, and the films were pulled until rupture. The TS and E were obtained from the tensile curve (MPa) by elongation (%).
