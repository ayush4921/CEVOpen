<p>Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was performed in an atomic force microscope (Solver Next SPM, NT-MDT, Zelenograd, Russia) in intermittent mode with a contact force of 5 N/m, scanning speed of 0.5 Hz using a tip (TAP 150AL-G, Budget Sensors Company, Sofia, Bulgaria) with resonance frequency of 150 kHz. The image area was 50 Âµm
 <sup>2</sup> and the average roughness was determined using Image Analysis 3.2.5 software.
