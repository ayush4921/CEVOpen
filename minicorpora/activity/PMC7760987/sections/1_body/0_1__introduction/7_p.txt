0: One of the alternatives is microencapsulation, which can assist in maintaining the bioactive components of essential oils [ 23].
1: This technique provides protection, stability, and allows the gradual release of these compounds [ 24].
2: However, scientific reports about the production of microparticles of copaiba oil incorporated into mangarito starch-based films are incipient in the literature.
3: In this context, the present work aimed to evaluate methods and the effects of incorporating copaiba oil into mangarito starch-based films on the physical, chemical, structural, and antimicrobial properties.
