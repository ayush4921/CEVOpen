<p>The film incorporated with copaiba oil directly allowed the formation of inhibition zones of 9.75 mm, close to the value obtained with 12% pure copaiba oil in the MIC analysis (9.88 mm) for 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, indicating that the oil bioactivity was maintained even after being mixed with the filmogenic solution and submitted to the drying process. However, the bioactive compounds of the oil that remained in the film were not sufficient to inhibit 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, as this was more resistant to inhibition.
