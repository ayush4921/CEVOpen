<p>The film with microencapsulated copaiba oil was able to inhibit the two bacteria tested, in which the antimicrobial effect of copaiba oil was enhanced due to being microencapsulated, since the microparticle film showed an inhibition zone of 11.38 mm against 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and 8.8 mm against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, which was higher than the MIC test. Possibly, during the film production process, the microparticle protected the compounds with antimicrobial activity from the copaiba oil.
