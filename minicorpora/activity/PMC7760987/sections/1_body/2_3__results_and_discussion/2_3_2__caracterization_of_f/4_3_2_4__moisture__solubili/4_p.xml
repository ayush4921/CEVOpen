<p>According to 
 <xref rid="polymers-12-02883-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, the degree of hydrophilicity of mangarito starch-based films was reduced with the incorporation of copaiba oil, directly and microencapsulated, which differed (p &lt; 0.05) between the formulations. Films with copaiba oil incorporated directly showed a greater contact angle (92.45°), followed by films with microencapsulated copaiba oil (81.78°), and the control film (47.19°). This can be explained by the incorporation of hydrophobic substances present in the oil [
