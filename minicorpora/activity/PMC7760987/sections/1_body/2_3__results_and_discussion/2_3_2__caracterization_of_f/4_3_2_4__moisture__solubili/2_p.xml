<p>The addition of copaiba oil, directly and microencapsulated, reduced (p &lt; 0.05) the solubility of the films (
 <xref rid="polymers-12-02883-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). This can be attributed to the reduction of the films hydrophilic character caused by the interaction between the oil components and hydroxyl groups of the polymeric matrix, which become less available and consequently improves the films resistance to water [

 <xref rid="polymers-12-02883-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), in which the films with copaiba oil and microparticles presented hydrophobic characteristics. Furthermore, the addition of microparticles reinforces the film structure, reducing the spaces in the polymer/microparticle interface, and promotes the diffusion of solute in the film [
