<p>According to 
 <xref rid="polymers-12-02883-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, there was a decrease in the moisture of the films with microparticles in comparison to the control film and those with the addition of oil. Song et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-polymers-12-02883" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] observed a similar behavior for corn starch-based films incorporated with lemon essential oil. Dashipour et al. [
 <xref rid="B68-polymers-12-02883" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] reported that the moisture content of the carboxymethylcellulose-based film decreased significantly when 
 <italic>Zataria multiflora</italic> essential oil was incorporated and attributed this to the reduction of the films hydrophilic nature.
