<p>The reduction in the roughness of films incorporated with oil directly may be associated with the oil liquid state, which filled in the irregularities of the polymer matrix during the drying process, resulting in more regular surfaces [

As for the incorporation of microparticles, the reduction in roughness in relation to the control film may be associated with the presence of gelatin and arabic gum as a coating for the microparticles, which promoted a reduction in the polymer/microparticle interface.
