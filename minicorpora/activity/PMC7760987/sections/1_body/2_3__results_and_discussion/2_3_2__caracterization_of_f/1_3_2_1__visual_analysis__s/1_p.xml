In general, the films presented a homogeneous surface and no insoluble particles. According to Mali et al. [
 <xref rid="B51-polymers-12-02883" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], when glycerol is incorporated into starch, molecular interactions occur due to hydrophilic affinity and the polymeric matrix undergoes structural modifications, which makes it less dense, facilitating the movements of the polysaccharide chains.
