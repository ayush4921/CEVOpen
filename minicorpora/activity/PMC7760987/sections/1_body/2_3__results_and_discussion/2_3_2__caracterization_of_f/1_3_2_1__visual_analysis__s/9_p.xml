<p>As observed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-12-02883-f003">Figure 3</xref>(F2,F3) the addition of oil directly or microencapsulated favored the change in the surface of the films. The films containing copaiba oil in direct or microencapsulated form was less rough when compared to the control, which can influence the antimicrobial activity of the film. According to Ghasemlou et al. [
 <xref rid="B57-polymers-12-02883" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] the fact that the essential oil of 
 <italic>Zataria multiflora</italic> B. is more distributed throughout the polymeric matrix of corn starch films, it may be responsible for its greater antimicrobial activity.
