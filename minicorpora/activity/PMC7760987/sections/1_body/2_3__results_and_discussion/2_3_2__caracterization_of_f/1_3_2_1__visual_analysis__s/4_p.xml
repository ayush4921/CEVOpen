<p>In the films incorporated with microencapsulated copaiba oil (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-12-02883-f002">Figure 2</xref>F3(B)), the formation of microcapsule clusters was observed, mainly distributed in the lower part of the film, indicating that they may have moved to the bottom of the plate during the drying process. Possibly, the microparticles remained intact after the production and drying process of the films and preserved the cohesive regions formed by the polymer (
