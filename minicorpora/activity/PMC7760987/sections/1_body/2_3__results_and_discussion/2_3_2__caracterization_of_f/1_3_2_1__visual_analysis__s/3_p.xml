<p>Brandelero et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-polymers-12-02883" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] reported that the incorporation of copaiba and lemongrass oils changed the structure of films based on cassava starch, polyvinyl alcohol, and sodium alginate and through the micrographs, they detected the presence of pores and cracks in the film matrix. During the drying process, the essential oils dispersed into the film-forming solution may suffer phenomena that destabilize the emulsion, such as flocculation and coalescence, in which the oil droplets partially move to the surface, providing volatilization and, consequently, the appearance of holes [
