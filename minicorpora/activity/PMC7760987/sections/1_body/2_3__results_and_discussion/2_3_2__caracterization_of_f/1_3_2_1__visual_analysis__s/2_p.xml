<p>The microstructures of mangarito starch-based films were evaluated according to the incorporation of copaiba oil, directly and microencapsulated (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-12-02883-f002">Figure 2</xref>B,C), in which the control film (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-12-02883-f002">Figure 2</xref>F1(B,C)) presented a homogeneous and smooth structure, without pores or fissures, which corroborates with what was observed visually, indicating that the starch granules were completely broken and the amylose/amylopectin molecules gelatinized [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-12-02883-f002">Figure 2</xref>F2(B,C)), a discontinuous matrix was formed, which possibly promoted the formation of heterogeneous zones. The oil may have made it difficult to aggregate the polymeric chain during the drying process, forming concave and convex irregularities [
