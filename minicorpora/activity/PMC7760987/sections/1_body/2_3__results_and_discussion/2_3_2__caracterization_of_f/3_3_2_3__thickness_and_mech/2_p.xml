<p>Overall, there was a reduction in the tensile strength and elongation of the films based on mangarito starch after the incorporation of copaiba oil in comparison to the control film and the one added with microparticles. This reduction is possibly related to the heterogeneity observed in the polymeric matrix after incorporating the oil. According to Bonilla et al. [
 <xref rid="B65-polymers-12-02883" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] the presence of oil can weaken the intermolecular forces of the polymer chain and make the film matrix less resistant. Brandelero et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-polymers-12-02883" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] also reported that the incorporation of copaiba oil reduced the tensile strength and elongation of films made of cassava starch, polyvinyl alcohol, and sodium alginate, and attributed this to the structural modification of the films due to the presence of the oil, which resulted in a discontinuous matrix.
