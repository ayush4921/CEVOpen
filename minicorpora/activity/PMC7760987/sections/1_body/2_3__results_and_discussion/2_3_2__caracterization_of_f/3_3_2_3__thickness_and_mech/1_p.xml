 <xref rid="polymers-12-02883-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> shows the thickness and mechanical properties (tensile strength and elongation) of mangarito starch-based films incorporated with copaiba oil directly and in microencapsulated form. The films based on mangarito starch (control film) showed no difference (p &gt; 0.05) in thickness (~0.07 mm) in comparison to the films produced with the oil incorporated directly and in microencapsulated form, indicating that the mass control was efficient during the production process.
