<p>Song et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-polymers-12-02883" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] attributed the reduced tensile strength of films based on corn and wheat starch, and the formation of a heterogeneous and discontinuous structure, to the incorporation of lemon essential oil into the polymeric matrix. The same was reported by Pelissari et al. [
 <xref rid="B66-polymers-12-02883" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] for films based on cassava starch, glycerol, and chitosan after the incorporation of oregano oil. The film incorporated with microparticles of copaiba oil showed no difference (p&gt; 0.05) in tensile strength from the control film, indicating good interaction between the microparticles and starch. An increase (p &lt;0.05) in elongation was also observed (
