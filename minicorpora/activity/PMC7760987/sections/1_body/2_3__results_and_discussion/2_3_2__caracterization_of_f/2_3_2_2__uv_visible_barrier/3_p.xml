<p>From the absorbance of samples at 600 nm as well as the thickness, it was possible to determine film transparency (
 <xref rid="polymers-12-02883-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The film incorporated with microencapsulated copaiba oil showed greater transparency (8.89%), followed by the control film (6.18%), and the one incorporated with copaiba oil directly (4.88%). The greater transparency of the film incorporated with microencapsulated copaiba oil can be possibly attributed to the gelatin used for the coating of the microparticles. According to Fakhouri et al. [
