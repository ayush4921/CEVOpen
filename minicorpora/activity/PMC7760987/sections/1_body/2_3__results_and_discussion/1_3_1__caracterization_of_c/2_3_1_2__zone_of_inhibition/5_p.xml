<p>According to Leandro et al. [

 <xref rid="B18-polymers-12-02883" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], copaiba oil bioactivity is confirmed mainly by the presence of sesquiterpenes, with an emphasis on β-caryophyllene however, the antimicrobial effects are obtained from the synergy between the compounds. Goren et al. [
 <xref rid="B48-polymers-12-02883" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] attributed β-caryophyllene to the antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, forming zones of 20 and 24 mm. According to Dahham et al. [
 <xref rid="B49-polymers-12-02883" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], β-caryophyllene presented an antimicrobial effect against
