<p>The cell wall of gram-positive bacteria is made up of teichoic and lipoteichoic acids, which can assist in the penetration of hydrophobic components of essential oils into cells [
 <xref rid="B44-polymers-12-02883" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Gram-negative bacteria have a lipopolysaccharide outer membrane (LPS), which replaces most phospholipids in the outer membrane and limits the diffusion rate of hydrophobic compounds in the polysaccharide layer [
 <xref rid="B45-polymers-12-02883" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. For this reason, gram-negative bacteria are more resistant to the effects of essential oils than gram-positive bacteria [
 <xref rid="B46-polymers-12-02883" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], which is possibly related to the non-formation of inhibition zones against the gram-negative bacteria studied (
