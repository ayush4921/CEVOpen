<p>Pacheco et al. [
 <xref rid="B47-polymers-12-02883" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] evaluated the antimicrobial activity of different varieties of copaiba (
 <italic>Copaifera</italic> sp.) oils and reported that the levels of inhibition against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> bacteria varied. This difference was attributed to the chemical composition of oils, and none of the oils evaluated showed antimicrobial activity against gram-negative bacteria. Morelli et al. [
 <xref rid="B18-polymers-12-02883" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] reported that copaiba oil had an antibacterial effect against 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, forming an inhibition zone of 11 mm.
