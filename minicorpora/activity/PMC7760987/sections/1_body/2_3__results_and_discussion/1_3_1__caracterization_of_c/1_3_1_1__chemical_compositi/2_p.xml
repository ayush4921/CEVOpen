<p>Other predominant compounds in copaiba oil were the sesquiterpenes α-guaiene (11.58%), β-bisabolene (5.27%), and α-copaene (5.01%), which corroborate with studies of different species of

 <xref rid="B15-polymers-12-02883" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], sesquiterpenes are the main components found in copaiba oil, which may represent more than 90% of its composition. The chemical composition of this oil can vary between species of the 
 <italic>Copaifera</italic> genus and this variation is generally associated with the climate, soil, and harvest area [
