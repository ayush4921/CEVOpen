0: The present study evaluated the effect of the incorporation of copaiba oil, in direct and in microencapsulated form, into films based on   Xanthosoma mafaffa Schott starch.
1: Initially, the characterization of copaiba oil by gas chromatograph coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and its antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was performed.
2: The films were produced by the casting technique and characterized in relation to physical, chemical, structural, and antimicrobial activity.
3: Sesquiterpenes, mainly -caryophyllene, were the predominant compounds in copaiba oil, showing antimicrobial activity against   B. subtilis and   S. aureus.
4: The films showed forming capacity, however, was observed a decrease in solubility and revealed an increase in hydrophobic characteristics.
5: However, the oil reduced the tensile strength and elongation, while the microcapsules did not influence the mechanical properties in comparison to the control film.
6: From microstructure analysis, changes in the films roughness and surface were observed after the addition of oil both directly and in microencapsulated form.
7: Films incorporated with microparticles were able to inhibit the gram-positive bacteria tested, forming inhibition zones, indicating that the encapsulation of copaiba oil was more efficient for protecting bioactive compounds from the oil, suggesting the possible application of mangarito starch-based films incorporated with copaiba oil as biodegradable packaging.
