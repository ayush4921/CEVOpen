<p>A large content of flavonoids luteolin-7-

 <xref rid="B78-molecules-25-04735" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>] reports a connection between the TPC and DPPH scavenging activity with the presence of eriodictyol, apigenin and caffeic acid in the aqueous extract of

As a significant decrease of the oxidative processes in a fat substance can be attained by adding a low concentration of oregano extracts, the single phenolic compounds cannot always be quantitatively determined by means of traditional chromatographic techniques, such as GC and HPLC.
