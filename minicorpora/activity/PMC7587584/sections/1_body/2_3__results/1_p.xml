 <xref rid="B46-molecules-25-04735" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] presents the identification and quantification of 23 flavonoids in Mexican oregano. A recent investigation reported on phenolic metabolites that have beneficial effects on human health, including inhibition of mutagenesis and carcinogenesis. To identify the phenolic profiles in different oregano extracts, HPLC analysis was carried out. In total, five major phenolic metabolites were identified; rosmarinic acid, caffeic acid, coumaric acid, protocatechuic acid and quercetin [
