0: The solvent of choice must be featured with a low viscosity in order to accelerate mass transfer.
1: At an elevated temperature, the viscosity of the solvent is reduced and the surface tension of the solvent is decreased, which results in a higher extraction rate.
2: Extraction conditions are adjusted in order to obtain the highest yields of volatile substances, and the influence of the extraction conditions and the precision of the method are examined.
3: Carvacrol, terpinen-4-ol, linalool, sabinene, -terpinene and -terpinene ( Figure 1) are the major components that contribute to antimicrobial and antioxidant activity [ 9].
