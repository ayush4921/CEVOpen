0: The use of various gases in the liquid or supercritical state as extracting solvents has been under research for nearly half of a century.
1: A large number of natural products have been extracted with carbon dioxide, and commercial plants in the food industry have already been well established.
2: Supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) of oregano leaves is suggested to concentrate and isolate antioxidant extracts to be used as functional food ingredients.
3: The extraction process has been evaluated in terms of both the quality and the activity of the antioxidant products obtained.
4: LCMS with electrospray has been used, along with a diode array detector, to characterize the extracts in terms of chemical composition; antioxidant activities have been measured using two different in vitro assays; 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) antiradical test and bleaching -carotene method.
