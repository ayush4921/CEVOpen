<p>High resolution and the ability to provide precise and accurate qualitative and quantitative data established gas-chromatography (GC) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS), i.e., GC-MS analyses as a valuable means for taxonomic research of plants. Several phenolic compounds have been found in plant materials using different detectors, such as the coulometric, electrochemical and photodiode arrays, as well as ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry and low-resolution mass spectrometry [
