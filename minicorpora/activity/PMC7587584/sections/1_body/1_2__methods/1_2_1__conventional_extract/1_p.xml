<p>The traditional methods of essential oil distillation are steam and hydrodistillation. Solidâ€“liquid extraction, using solvents, such as methanol, ethanol and acetone is utilized for the extraction of antioxidants from plant matters. The extraction method and the extraction conditions can affect the chemical composition of the essential oils [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-25-04735" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These effects need to be considered according to the application of essential oils [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-25-04735" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Hydrodistillation is among the oldest extraction techniques for the isolation of essential oils. Long extraction times, which could lead to the hydrolysis of some heat-sensitive components, and complicated control of process parameters, which may consequence in inadequate extract composition, are the main disadvantages of the method. Therefore, researchers are chasing alternatives to this extraction principle [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-25-04735" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The application of supercritical fluids as an extraction media could offer a solution to this issue. Indeed, according to the results of the evaluation and comparison of the chemical profile of essential oils of marjoram (
 <italic>Origanum majorana</italic>) and oregano (
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic>) obtained by hydrodistillation and supercritical CO
 <sub>2</sub>, both essential oils presented similar chemical profiles. Cis-sabinene hydrate was determined as the major compound in the essential oil obtained by supercritical extraction with CO
 <sub>2</sub>, whilst terpinen-4-ol was present as the main compound in the essential oil obtained by hydrodistillation. Supercritical CO
 <sub>2</sub> extraction gave a higher yield of essential oils compared to hydrodistillation and the concentrations of oxygenated monoterpenes were higher without significant differences between fractions.
