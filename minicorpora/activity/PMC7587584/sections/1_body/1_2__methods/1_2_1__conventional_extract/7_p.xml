<p>Water has been proved as a proficient extraction solvent for the isolation of phenolic acids, including chlorogenic, vanillic, gallic, cinnamic, coumaric, ferulic and caffeic acid. In addition, chrysin, epicatechin, naringenin, catechin, kaempferol, quercetin, rutin, luteolin-7-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucoside, apigenin-7-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucoisde, rosmarinic acid and luteolin were also identified in the water extracts of various oregano species [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-25-04735" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Chloroform [

 <xref rid="B27-molecules-25-04735" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and acetone in mixtures with water and organic solvents have also been applied [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-25-04735" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Reports have shown that flavones are among the most abundant subgroup of flavonoids in the extracts of oregano species followed by flavonols, flavanones and flavanol. The principal components of flavonoids and phenolic compounds may vary considerably in different oregano species. Additionally, geographical and environmental factors have been demonstrated as the key parameters determining the flavonoid and phenolic acids profile of chemotypes within the same species. Verbascoside has been identified in the water extract of the 
 <italic>Lippia citriodora</italic> species [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-25-04735" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], whilst caffeic acid, lithospermic acid and rosmarinic acid were present in the water extract of 
 <italic>Majorana hortensis</italic> attained under the same process conditions [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-25-04735" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Gallic acid, caffeic acid, 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid and rosmarinic acid were present in the water extract of 
 <italic>Origanum acutidens</italic> [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-25-04735" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].
