0: A method that delivers a high yield and excellent quality of essential oil, which retains most of its value-added compounds, and undergoes least change after the extraction process, is greatly sought after.
1: Although chemical free methods are acceptable, they call for an extensive processing time, while the yield and quality from these methods are often disappointing.
2: This work utilizes subcritical water technology to address these issues.
3: In this undertaking, essential oil was extracted from   Aquilaria malaccensis wood by way of subcritical conditions, and characterized through gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS).
4: Optimization through response surface methodology revealed temperature to be the most critical factor for the extraction process, while the optimum conditions for temperature, sample-to-solvent ratio, and time for subcritical water extraction was revealed as 225 C, 0.2 gr/mL, and 17 min, respectively.
5: The subcritical water extraction technique involves two simultaneous processes, which are based on good fitting to the two-site kinetic and second order model.
6: In comparison to the hydrodistillation method, GC/MS results indicated that the quality of   A. malaccensis wood oils, derived through the subcritical water technique, are of significantly better quality, while containing many constructive value-added compounds, such as furfural and guaiacol, which are useful for the production of pesticides and medicines.
7: Pore size, functional groups, and morphology analysis revealed the occurrence of substantial damage to the samples, which facilitated an improved extraction of bio-products.
8: In comparison to conventional methods, the use of the subcritical method not only involves a shorter processing time, but also delivers a higher oil yield and quality.
