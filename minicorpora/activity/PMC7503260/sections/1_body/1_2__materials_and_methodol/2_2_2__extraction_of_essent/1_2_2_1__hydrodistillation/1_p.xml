<p>A Clevenger-type apparatus, described by European pharmacopeia, was used to extract essential oil from 
 <italic>A. malaccensis</italic> wood. Prior to the extraction process, the wood was soaked in water for seven days, in order to speed up the release of essential oil. Then, 100 g of air-dried and size-reduced wood of 
 <italic>A. Malaccensis</italic>, and an appropriate amount of distilled water, was placed in a bowl-shaped heating mantle, which was attached to the Clevenger. The sample mixtures were boiled at 100 Â°C and 1 atm to produce steam containing both water and essential oil. This product was condensed and collected in a vessel of the Clevenger. The extra condensed water was recycled to the flask during the extraction process. The extraction process ends with the removal of water, followed by the collection of floating essential oil, both through the bottom. The essential oil and wood sample, at optimized hydrodistillation conditions, were subsequently purified and analysed, for a later comparison with SCWE products.
