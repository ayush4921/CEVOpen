<p>Wood of 
 <italic>Aquilaria malaccensis</italic> was collected from the Forest Research Institute Malaysia (FRIM) garden. The wood was air-dried in a dark room away from sunlight (to avoid the loss of volatiles due to light and temperature), and stored in a bag at a cool room temperature (4 °C), for the experiments to follow. All botanical materials require size-reduction before the extraction process, to improve sample distribution, heat transfer, and access to the cells’ content. This will serve to quicken the release of essential oil. A saw was used to cut the wood into smaller pieces. Then, each piece of wood was shredded with a small knife. The final step in the extraction preparation process involves the use of a grinder (Panasonic miller) to crush the shredded wood. This is to prevent the loss of volatiles.
