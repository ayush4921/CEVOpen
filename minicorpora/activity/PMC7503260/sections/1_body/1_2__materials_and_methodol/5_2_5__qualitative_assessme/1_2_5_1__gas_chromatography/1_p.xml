<p>The extracted essential oils, from HD and SCWE, were analysed using the Shimadzu Auto Injector GC/MS, equipped with an FID detector and a BP5 capillary column. 20 µL of essential oil was diluted in 500 µL of n-Hexane as the solvent. In the next step, the mixture of essential oil and n-Hexane was injected with helium, which performed the role of carrier gas for identification. During the analysis, the running time was set for 90 min, and both the temperature and pressure were increased from 50 to 250 °C, and 37.1 to 100 kPa, respectively. </p>
