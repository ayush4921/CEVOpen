0: Subcritical water extraction (SCWE), a new and promising extraction method, is safe, fast, economical, and environmentally friendly.
1: This method entails the use of water subjected to high pressure, which raises its temperature to above its normal boiling point.
2: The use of water, as the solvent for the extraction of essential oil, is both cost-effective and environmentally friendly [ 15].
3: Furthermore, SCWE has been observed to require a significantly shorter extraction time (around 23 times), and the consumption of a lower amount of raw material, to produce a higher quality and quantity of essential oil [ 16].
4: Previously, the utilization of the SCWE method, for the extraction of essential oil from  Aquilaria crassna, under subcritical conditions (100, 125, and 150 C), resulted in a higher yield of  A. crassna oils in a shorter time period, in comparison to the utilization of hydrodistillation [ 16].
5: These findings suggest that in terms of time, yield, and quality, the SCWE method could represent a better alternative to the currently available conventional methods, for the extraction of  A. malaccensis oil.
6: With this in mind, this undertaking delves into the potential of employing SCWE for the extraction of  A. malaccensis essential oil.
7: To date, no studies have been conducted on the optimization of subcritical water extraction (SCWE) for the extraction of  A. malaccensis oil from wood.
8: This investigation is aimed at bridging this gap.
