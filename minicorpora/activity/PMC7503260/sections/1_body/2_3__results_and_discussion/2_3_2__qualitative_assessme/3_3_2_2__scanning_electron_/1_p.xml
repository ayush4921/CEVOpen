 <italic>malaccensis</italic>’ wood clearly show significant changes in the structure of the sample, after HD and SCWE extraction. However, with subcritical conditions, the sample’s cell walls were severely ruptured and collapsed, due to the elevated temperature and pressure. The disruption of the cell walls promotes the efficiency of the water, by removing the barrier in its way. In addition, the increase in pressure within the plant glands, serves to improve the essential oil extraction process [

The SEM analysis also provided evidence that despite the long duration of the HD process (one-week soaking followed by 16 h of extraction), the hydro-distillation extraction process failed to completely extract essential oil from the plant cells. This can be attributed to the fact that the 
 <italic>A. malaccensis</italic>’ wood glands were only partially ruptured (
