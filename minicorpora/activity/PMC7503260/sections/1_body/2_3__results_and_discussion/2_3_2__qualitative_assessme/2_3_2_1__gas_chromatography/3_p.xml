<p>The increase in the number of compounds in the oil extracted through SCWE, during a significantly short time, can be explained by the low polarity, permittivity, viscosity, and surface tension of water, which resulted in the enhancement of water efficiency, with regards to the extraction of different classes of compounds [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-25-03872" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The high pressure-temperature condition of SCWE enables the water to emulate the performance of organic solvents, and improve the solubility of compounds [

 <xref rid="B27-molecules-25-03872" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-25-03872" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. For instance, compounds such as furfural and guaiacol, which are slightly soluble in water at ambient temperature [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-25-03872" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], tend to increase in solubility at an elevated temperature and pressure [

 <xref rid="B27-molecules-25-03872" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03872-f005">Figure 5</xref>, high temperature-pressure not only facilitates the effective breakage of a plantâ€™s cell-wall [

 <xref rid="B39-molecules-25-03872" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], but also facilitates the degradation of lignin, xylose, cellulose, and hemicelluloses during the subcritical process. This is made evident through the appearance of small compounds such as furfural, syringol, vanillin, guaiacol, and its derivatives [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-25-03872" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-25-03872" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Due to the fact that the performance of SCWE occurs at high temperatures and pressures in the presence of water, unwanted reactions such as hydrolysis, degradation, charring, and others are inevitable.
