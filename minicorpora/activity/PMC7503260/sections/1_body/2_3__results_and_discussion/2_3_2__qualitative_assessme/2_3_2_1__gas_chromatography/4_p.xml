<p>Differences between the results of this study and other findings, in terms of identified chemical compounds, may be attributed to the different extraction systems (HD and SCWE), natural sample variations due to their different regions of origin, and different inoculation methods for the production of resinous wood [

 <xref rid="B42-molecules-25-03872" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. It has been established that the amount of essential oil, as well as the chemical composition of essential oil, varies according to the extraction method employed [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-25-03872" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The difference in percentage of chemical compounds in the essential oils extracted by HD and SCWE during this study is to be expected, considering the nature of their extraction conditions. Given that the total number of identified compounds increased during SCWE, the percentage of each compound, which is calculated by considering the total compounds, is anticipated to decrease.
