 <italic>A. malaccensis</italic> wood essential oil extracted through HD (1-week soaking + 16 h) and SCWE (13 min) were observed to hold common important compounds of agarwood, including hexadecenoic acid and benzylacetone. However, as depicted in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-03872-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, the chemical composition of 
 <italic>A. malaccensis</italic> wood oil extracted by way of SCWE also contained several compounds of medicinal value (for instance guaiacol, furfural, vanillin, phenylacetaldehyde, and syringol, among others), and some low molecular weight compounds (C
 <sub>5</sub> series, e.g., furfural and acetylfuran), which are non-existent in the oil extracted by way of HD. Moreover, as the essential oil extracted by SCWE contains a higher percentage of sesquiterpenes and oxygenated compounds, which are the quality-determinant compounds for

 <italic>A. malaccensis</italic> wood essential oil contains important signature compounds, such as agarospirol, hexadecenoic acid, and benzylacteone, among others.
