<p>The similarity of the effect of HD and SCWE on the porosity of the wood sample indicates that SCWE (similar to HD) can effectively extract essential oil, even if the extraction time is brief. However, despite the fact that the range of pore size is similar in both samples after HD and SCWE, the BET result showed that the pore volume of the wood sample significantly increased from 0.063353 cm
 <sup>3</sup>/g (i.e., before the extraction) to 0.186294 cm
 <sup>3</sup>/g after extraction by SCWE, while the increase was only 0.063172 cm
 <sup>3</sup>/g after extraction by HD. Thus, it can be surmised that even though the pores were enlarged through HD, deeper penetration into the pores was not achieved. The similarity in pore volume of the raw sample, and the sample after HD, reveals the ineffectiveness of HD compared to SCWE, when it comes to penetrating the sample for the extraction of essential oil. Consequently, based on the BET result, SCWE is not only capable of enlarging the pore size, but also effective when it comes to increasing the pore volume of the wood sample. As mentioned earlier, the changes in physical properties of water in SCWEâ€™s high-temperature-pressure condition plays a key role in improving the extraction and mass transfer process [

Firstly, the high temperature-pressure of the SCWE process causes major rupturing of the cell wall, and secondly, it simultaneously decreases the viscosity and surface tension of water, which facilitates better matrix penetration, and consequently better oil liberation [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03872-f007">Figure 7</xref>), before and after extraction by both HD and SCWE, revealed that they follow the same IUPAC type. The BET and BJH results confirmed that the SCWE method is more effective than the HD method, as in a short time, both pore size and pore volume of the wood sample changed significantly after SCWE.
