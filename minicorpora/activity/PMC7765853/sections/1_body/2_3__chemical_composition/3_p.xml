<p>The essential oil composition varies according to environmental conditions, geographical area, harvesting time, and stage of plant maturity. The essential oil from plants in different countries has been evaluated in terms of chemical composition and major components have been identified depending on the area of origin [
 <xref rid="B14-ijms-21-09653" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Essential oils obtained from plants collected in Italy allowed the detection of 37 compounds, among which in greater quantities were thymol, carvacrol, linalyl acetate, and

 <italic>γ</italic>-terpinene, and 
 <italic>β</italic>-fenchyl alcohol as main compounds in the essential oil [

 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene, linalyl acetate, and 
 <italic>α</italic>-terpineol as major constituents [

The differences in the composition of essential oil in different organs of the plant have also been investigated, revealing variations in the content of certain compounds. For example, the stem oil was poorer in monoterpene hydrocarbons compared to leaf oil [
