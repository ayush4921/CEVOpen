<p>Laothaweerungsawat et al. revealed the cosmeceutical potential of two samples of 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> L. essential oil as a skin-aging retarding agent. They compared OEO from Chiang Mai, Thailand obtained by hydrodistillation and a commercial oil purchased from Botanic essence (Product of Spain). Using ascorbic acid as positive control in anti-collagenase and anti-elastase activity determination and oleanolic acid as positive control in the determination of anti-hyaluronidase, the research group showed that OEO from Chiang Mai, possessed a significant higher anti-skin-aging activity compared to ascorbic acid (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), with inhibition against collagenase, elastase, and hyaluronidase of 92.0 ± 9.7%, 53.1 ± 13.3%, and 16.7 ± 0.3%, at the concentration of 67, 25, and 4 µg/mL, respectively. However, the anti-hyaluronidase activity of both essential oils was mitigated when compared to oleanolic acid. The retardation of collagen and elastin loss may occur due to the phytocompound carvacrol identified in the highest amount in both essential oils OEO from a highland area of a tropical country (79.5%) and commercial OEO (64.6%) [
