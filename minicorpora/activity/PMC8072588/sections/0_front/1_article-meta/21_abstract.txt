0: This study describes the chemical composition, antitumor, antioxidant, and antimicrobial activities of the plant   Thymus algeriensis Boiss.
1: Essential oils (EOs) were collected in different periods (before, during, and after flowering stage) from the El-Guetfa region, Msila, Algeria.
2: The EOs extraction was achieved using three distinguishing techniques: hydro (Clevenger trap), steam, and microwave distillations, targeting different aerial parts of the plant (stems, flowers, and leaves).
3: The EOs chemical components were estimated using GC-FID and GC-MS apparatuses.
4: The resulting yield of the extracted oil was moderate and ranged between 0.84 and 1.53% (  wt/  vol).
5: In total, eighty-five components were identified, in which the oxygenated monoterpenes family formed the main portion, starting from 40.56 up to 70.66%.
6: The obtained essential oil was dominated by five major components that varied from low to quite moderate percentages: camphor (17.4532.56%), borneol (11.1622.2%), camphene (7.5312.86%), 1.8-cineole (5.1611.21%), and bornyl acetate (3.867.92%).
7: The biological results of this oil pointed out that the EOs extracted from the leaves part exposed a weak radical scavenging activity afterward using two well-known antioxidant assays DPPH (IC  50 = 8.37 mg/mL) and ABTS (10.84 mg/mL).
8: Meanwhile, this oil presented strong inhibition activity against colon cancer cell line HCT116 (LC50 = 39.8 g/mL) and a moderate inhibitory against hepatocellular cancer cells HePG2 (LC50 > 100 g/mL).
9: In addition, this oil antimicrobial activity was quite important against   Micrococcus luteus (M. luteus)  , Staphylococcus aureus CIP 7625,   Escherichia coli ATCC 10536,   Saccharomyces cerevisiae ATCC   4226,   Candida albicans IPA200,   Candida tropicalis (Ct), and   Candida glabrata (Cg) after using Amoxicillin and Itraconazole as references.
