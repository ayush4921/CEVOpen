 <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> seed has a high proportion of monounsaturated/saturated fatty acids (MUFA/SFA), sterols and tocopherols, as well as proteins rich in sulphur amino acids [
 <xref rid="B32-plants-10-00318" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. As reported in previous studies, 
 <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> seed oils (also called Behen oil, which is the commercial name given to 
 <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> oil) have similar fatty acid content and physicochemical parameters to those reported for other vegetable oils and can be considered as a healthy alternative to hydrogenated oils in food formulations. The main fatty acids present in 
 <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> oil are behenic, linoleic, stearic, palmitic, oleic, arachidic, linolenic, eicosenoic and heptadecanoic acids [
 <xref rid="B25-plants-10-00318" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], with oleic acid being the main unsaturated fatty acid, with 73.5% in the seed oil [
 <xref rid="B33-plants-10-00318" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]; carbohydrate content is 27.5% [
 <xref rid="B27-plants-10-00318" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The seeds are a rich source of Ca and Mg, respectively [
