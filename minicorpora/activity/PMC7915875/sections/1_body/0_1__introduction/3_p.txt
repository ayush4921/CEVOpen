0: However, not all of the plant is probably safe, as toxic compounds have been found [ 11].
1: On the other hand, its uses are varied, as the seed is used to purify water and the oil from the seeds can be used as a fertiliser [ 6].
2: Considering that previous studies have shown that bioactive compounds from herbs and plants could be used for functional food product innovation [ 11, 12, 13, 14].
3: Moringa oleifera plants could be used for functional food and other industrial food applications [ 15].
4: Therefore,  Moringa oleifera provides nutrients that benefit health, making it a key food for food security in areas with fewer economic resources [ 16], this review summarises recent knowledge on bioactive compounds from  Moringa oleifera plants and their potential use in the formulation of food products, especially bakery products.
5: The objective of this review is to know the uses and applications of  Moringa oleifera in bakery products, in order to know what the quantity or concentration of  Moringa oleifera is that allows maintaining the sensory characteristics of the product.
