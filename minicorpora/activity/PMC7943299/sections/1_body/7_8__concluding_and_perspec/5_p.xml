<p>Fourth, the current quality control of ZRR is mainly based on the content requirements of gingerols. For example, 6-gingerol, 8-gingerol, and 10-gingerol are selected as the quality control indicators of ZRR in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia, and the minimum content is made. However, the content of ingredients cannot scientifically explain the quality of ZRR. The quality evaluation of ZRR should be related to clinical efficacy. The quality standard research of ZRR in the future is not only related to the content of components, but also to the pharmacological activity. In order to better define the quality of ZRR, the quality markers of pharmacodynamics are selected as the measurement indexes of quality standards. In recent years, the fingerprint analysis of traditional Chinese medicine is becoming more and more important in the analysis of traditional Chinese medicine. Future research can better define the content and change of components with the help of traditional Chinese medicine fingerprint, so as to ensure the stability of the quality of ZRR.</p>
