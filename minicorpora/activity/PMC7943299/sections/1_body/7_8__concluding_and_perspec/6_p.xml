<p>In conclusion, the botanical characterizations, traditional usages, chemical components, pharmacological activities, toxicity, and quality control of Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens were reviewed in this paper. In recent years, with the development of science and technology, ZRR has made significant progress in chemical components and pharmacological activities, but there are still some challenges. How to clarify the mechanism of traditional uses and modern pharmacological activities and how to establish the correlation research between chemical components and pharmacological activities are the focus of research. It is anticipated that this study can provide a basis for further study of ZRR and promote the long-term development.</p>
