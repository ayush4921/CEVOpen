<p>At present, there are more than ten clear gingerols, including 6-, 8-, 10-, and 12-gingerol. The properties and structures of these components are similar. There are C
 <sub>3</sub> carbonyl and C
 <sub>5</sub> hydroxy (i.e., 
 <italic>ß</italic>-hydroxyketone structure) in their molecular structures, which makes the chemical properties of gingerols extremely unstable. For example, in acid condition (pH &lt; 4.5), the active hydrogen of C
 <sub>4</sub> is easy to dehydrate with the hydroxyl of C
 <sub>5</sub> to form shogaols; in heating or alkaline condition, the carbon-carbon bond between C
 <sub>4</sub> and C
 <sub>5</sub> breaks to form zingerone and corresponding aldehydes. The transformation of gingerols under different conditions is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. In addition, the length of the side chain, the acetoxy group at the 3, 5 position, the methoxy group on the aromatic ring, and the phenolic hydroxyl functional group all affect the biological activity of gingerols [
