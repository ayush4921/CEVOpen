<p>Diarylheptanoids are a group of substances with nuclear structure of 1, 7-diarylheptanoid. According to their structural characteristics, they can be divided into two groups: cyclic diarylheptanoid and linear diarylheptanoid. The chemical structure of linear diarylheptanoid is characterized by the position of two phenyl substituents at 1, 7 of heptane skeleton, the substituents on phenyl are methoxy or hydroxy, and the substituents are in para- or interposition; there are 3 types of substituted diphenyl groups: phenyl, 4-hydroxyphenyl, and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenyl [
