<p>In addition to the above mentioned pharmacological effects, research has been conducted into the medicinal effects of ingredients isolated from ZRR, such as 6-gingerol and 6-shogaol. For example, in a study about the effects of 6-gingerol and 6-shogaol on isolated guinea pig ileum contraction, the study found that the mechanism of antiemetic may be noncompetitive blocking of the 5-HT
 <sub>3</sub> receptor by 6-gingerol and 6-shogaol [

 <sub>1</sub> receptor, which suggested that 6-gingerol and 6-shogaol may be the main active ingredients of ZRR for alleviating vomiting [
