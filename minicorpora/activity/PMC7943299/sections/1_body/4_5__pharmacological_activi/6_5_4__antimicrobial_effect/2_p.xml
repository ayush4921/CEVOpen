<p>ZEE has been reported to have antimicrobial effects against 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic>, 
 <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic>, 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, 
 <italic>and Candida krusei.</italic> The MICs of ZRR against the above bacteria are 40, 40, 20, 20, 20, 20, and 10, 5 mg/mL, respectively [
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. In broth microdilution assays, ZME exhibited antibacterial activities against 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> (MIC = 12.5 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL). With the increase of extract concentration, the inhibition zone increased. When the concentration of the extract was 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumonia</italic> showed the highest susceptibility (29.04 ± 0.35 mm), followed by 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, and 
 <italic>Salmonella typhi</italic>, while 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> had the least inhibition zone [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Different concentration of ZEE had different degrees of antibacterial effect, and the most antibacterial effect was at 75% ethanol solution. And the effect was as follows: 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> &gt; 
 <italic>Yeast</italic> &gt; 
 <italic>Staphylococcus albus</italic> &gt; 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> 
 <italic>&gt;</italic> mixed microbes from egg surface [
