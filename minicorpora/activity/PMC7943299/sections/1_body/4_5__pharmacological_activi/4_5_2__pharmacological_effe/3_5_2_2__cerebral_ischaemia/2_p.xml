<p>In addition to FCI-R injury, ZRR also had a protective effect on cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (CI-R) injury. The experimental results of Wang et al. confirmed the protective effect of ZAE (100 mg/kg) on CI-R injury, which seems to be associated with inflammatory factors and adhesion factors, involving changes in the in vivo activity of TNF-
