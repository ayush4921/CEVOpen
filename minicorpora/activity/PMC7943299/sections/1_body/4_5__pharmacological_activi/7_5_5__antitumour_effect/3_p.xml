<p>According to reports in the past years, 6-gingerol has been proven to have potential anticancer activities against renal-cell carcinoma [
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], human oral (SCC4, KB) and cervical cancer (HeLa) cell lines [
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], human colon cancer cell LoVo [
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], human breast cancer MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 [
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], human umbilical vein endothelial cells [
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>], osteosarcoma cells [
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], and human gastric adenocarcinoma cell line [
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Its mechanisms included inhibiting the growth of tumour cells, inducing cell cycle arrest and inducing apoptosis. The antitumor effect of 6-gingerol on renal cancer cells in vivo and in vitro showed that 6-gingerol inhibited the growth of ACHN, 786-O, and 769-P cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner mainly through the AKT-GSK 3
 <italic>Î²</italic>-cyclin D1 signaling pathway to induce G1 cell cycle arrest and decrease Ki-67 expression in the nucleus [
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Additionally, 6-gingerol exerted an antitumor effect by inducing cell apoptosis and inducing cell cycle arrest, including G2 phase arrest of KB and HeLa cells, and S phase arrest of SCC4 cells [
