<p>6-Shogaol has been demonstrated to have potential anticancer activities towards human renal-cell carcinoma 786-O [
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] and ovarian cancer cell lines A2780 [
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>], and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines [
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Studies showed that 6-shogaol had a dose-dependent antiproliferative effect and induced the apoptosis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines by downregulating survivin [
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. 6-Gingerol inhibited STAT-3 translocation of ovarian cancer cells to inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis [
