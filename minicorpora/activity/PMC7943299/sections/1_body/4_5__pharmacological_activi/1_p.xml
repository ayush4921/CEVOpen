<p>In recent years, many researchers have conducted in-depth research on the pharmacological effects of extracts or isolated compounds from ZRR and have found that ZRR has a wide range of pharmacological effects (
 <xref rid="tab5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). Modern pharmacological studies confirmed the traditional efficacy of ZRR, particularly in antiemetic. The main mechanism of action may be related to the 5-HT receptor, but further studies are required to define the related mechanisms. Pharmacological studies in animals experiments also showed that ZRR has potential as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cognition. The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of ZE and its isolated compounds also indicated pharmacological effects in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular fields. In addition, in vitro and in vivo pharmacological studies have shown that ZE and compounds have antibacterial and antitumor effects.
