<p>When exploring the anti-inflammatory mechanism of ZRR and its active ingredients, it was found that 6-shogaol (20 
 <italic>μ</italic>g) inhibited ultraviolet radiation B-induced inflammatory response, including reducing the expression of COX-2 and iNOS and reducing the expression of IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> in human epidermal keratinocytes [

A study of 6-shogaol showed that it inhibited the inflammatory response of the ligated periodontitis model in mice, and 6-shogaol attenuated the inflammatory response by reducing the number of macrophages and neutrophils in periodontal tissues and reducing the expression of IL-1
 <italic>β</italic> and TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> and, therefore, may be a therapeutic agent against periodontitis [
