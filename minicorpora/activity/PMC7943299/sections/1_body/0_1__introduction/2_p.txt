0: In recent years, many researchers have carried out in-depth research on the phytochemical and pharmacological effects of ZRR and made significant progress.
1: Modern phytochemical studies have shown that the main components of ZRR include gingerols, essential oils, diarylheptanoids, and other compounds.
2: Pharmacological studies have also shown that ZRR has a wide range of pharmacological effects, including effects on the nervous system and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular systems, as well as antiemetic, antibacterial, antitumor, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects.
3: This review provides information on the botanical characterizations, traditional usages, chemical constituents, pharmacological activities, toxicity, and quality control of ZRR.
4: In this paper, we hope to have a comprehensive understanding of the effects of ZRR and also provide a basis for further research.
