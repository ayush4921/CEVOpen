0: Mallo, Lamas [ 26] analyzed the in vitro effects of the natural polyphenolic compound resveratrol (Fig.
1: 1) present in grape skins [ 82], against  T. vaginalis.
2: The effect was cytostatic at a concentration of 25 M and cytotoxic at 100 M, with calculated mean IC 50 values of 32 M on day 1 and 25 M on day 2, respectively.
3: The corresponding IC 50 values using metronidazole are 3.2 M and 4.25 M, respectively.
4: Although the kinetics of the in vitro inhibition of the  T. vaginalis cells by resveratrol and metronidazole are similar, in terms of IC 50 values, metronidazole was about 6- to 10-fold more effective than resveratrol.
