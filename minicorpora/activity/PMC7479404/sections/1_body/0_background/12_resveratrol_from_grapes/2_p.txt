0: The authors also obtained cellular and molecular evidence for the possible mechanism of action of resveratrol against the parasite, as indicated by the following findings.
1: Resveratrol acted primarily as an inhibitor of the enzyme 120-kDA [Fe] hydrogenase (Tvhyd), upregulated the enzyme hydrogenosomal pyruvate-ferrodoxin oxidoreductase, and induced overexpression of the heat-shock protein 70 (Hsp 70), a protective protein found in the hydrogenosome of  T. vaginalis.
2: The authors suggest that the deleterious inhibitory effect of resveratrol resulted from the inhibition of hydrogen production in the hydrogenosomes and changes in iron transport, causing a high degree of bioenergetic stress in the treated parasites.
3: This mechanism differs from the antioxidative mechanisms that have been proposed for other multi-beneficial effects of resveratrol, including cancer [ 83] and heart disease [ 84].
4: Additional studies by several investigators designed to elucidate mechanistic aspect of anti-trichomonad effect in  T. vaginalis are highlighted below in a separate Mechanisms section.
