0: We evaluated the anti-trichomonad activities of six anthraquinones, the structures of which are shown in Fig.
1: 3, against the three pathogenic protozoal strains G3 (human), C1 (bovine), and D1 (feline) mentioned earlier [ 103].
2: The following are the results under the test conditions in terms of percentage inactivation of G3, C1 and D1, respectively: aloe-emodin, 82.3, 99.0, and 92.0; anthraquinone, 62.0, 51.3, and 63.7; anthrarufin, 53.4, 60.0, and 73.4; chrysazin, 56.7; 91.1, and 97.4; emodin, 57.7, 41.4, and 78.8; and purpurin, 58.8, 72.2, and 79.0.
3: These results show that aloe-emodin was the most active compound against the three strains and that structurally different anthraquinones are a major source of new trichomonacidal compounds.
4: In related studies, we have shown that some of the mentioned anthraquinones exhibited antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties in chemical assays and macrophage cells [ 104], and that purpurin added to a high-fat diet significantly reduced weight gain in mice [ 105].
5: Could purpurin protect individuals against both trichomoniasis and obesity?
