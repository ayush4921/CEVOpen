0: Friedman, Huang [ 14] describe the inactivation, using cell-based assays, of the three pathogenic protozoal strains  T. vaginalis human G3,  Tritrichomonas foetus feline C1, and  Tritrichomonas foetus bovine D1 by the potato ( Solanum tuberosum) glycoalkaloids -chaconine and -solanine, their common aglycone solanidine, three potato phenolic compounds (Fig.
1: 1), and six potato peel powders.
2: The two glycoalkaloids completely inhibited all three strains under the test conditions, with the following IC 50 values (concentration that inhibited 50% of the cells under the test conditions) calculated from concentration-response data: for G3, -solanine 15.8 M and -chaconine 35.6 M; for C1, -solanine 12.6 M and -chaconine 51.5 M, and for D1 -solanine 10.9 M and -chaconine 3560 M. Solanidine was less active, inactivating G3, C1 and D1 to 48.4, 22.6, and 23.0%, respectively.
3: IC 50 values were not calculated for inhibitory activities of< 50%.
4: Three potato phenolic compounds also inactivated the three strains.
5: Caffeic acid inhibited G3 to 42.8%; D1 to 43.7%; and C1 to 21.1%.
6: The corresponding values for chlorogenic acid are 11.4, 12.1, and 21.9%, and for quercetin 45.6, 18.9, and 18.5%, respectively.
7: Additional studies found that six potato peel powders containing glycoalkaloids and other bioactive compounds [ 44] also inhibited the three trichomonads.
8: The percentage inhibition of G3 ranged from 1 (red potato peel) to 36.6 (organic Russet potato peel); of D1 from 9.0 (red potato peel) to 41.4 (organic Russet potato peel); and of C1 from 0 (purple potato peel) to 48.6 (organic Russet peel).
9: Disc-diffusion screening revealed no effect on normal microbiota in the vaginal flora.
