0: Patridge, Darnell [ 115] found that the bioactive 3-decalinoyltetramic acid (pyrrolocin A) (Fig.
1: 2) they isolated from the Amazonian fungal endophyte E6927E inhibited the growth of the pathogenic bacteria  Staphylococcus aureus and  Enterococcus faecalis as well as isolates of the pathogenic fungal strains  Candidas albicans and  Aspergillus sp.
2: King, Carter [ 25], using an image-based, high-throughput, and high-content for testing natural products for anti-trichomonal activity, discovered that pyrrolocin A was also a potent inhibitor of  T. vaginalis with an effective inhibitory concentration (EC 50) of 60 nM.
3: Because the fungal compound also showed limited toxicity towards mammalian cervical cells with a high selectivity index of > 100, the results of the two investigations suggest that pyrrolocin A has the potential to protect food and humans concurrently against contamination and infection by pathogenic bacteria, fungi, and  T. vaginalis.
4: Will pyrrolocin A, with the exceptional high in vitro activity against  T. vaginalis, also show similar activity after oral consumption or intravaginal application in women?
5: Will pyrrolocin A-supplemented liquid and solid food protect humans against microbial, fungal, and protozoal infections?
6: Will pyrrolocin A also be active against antibiotic-resistant bacteria, fungi [ 116,  117] and protozoa in vitro and in vivo?
7: We are challenged to respond to these research needs.
8: (Also see the above section on marine compounds for a description of anti-trichomonal effects of compounds from marine fungi).
