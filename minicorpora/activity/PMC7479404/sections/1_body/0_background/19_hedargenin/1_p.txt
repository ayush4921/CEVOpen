0: A review (meta-analysis) by Mehriardestani, Aliahmadi [ 19] that discusses reported anti-trichomonad effects of 13 medicinal plants and some of their bioactive purified compounds identified 95 relevant in vitro and clinical studies, including human studies.
1: Alkaloids, isoflavonoid glycosides, essential oils, lipids, saponins, and sequiterpene lactones isolated from a number of medicinal plant families were shown to possess anti-trichomonad activity.
2: These include cardimine, lycorine, methyl jasmonate and 12 other compounds with defined structures that exhibited remarkable anti-trichomonad properties.
3: The pentacyclic terpenoid hedargenin (Fig.
4: 2) from the bark of  Cassnia holstii had the best activity, with an IC 50 value against  T. vaginalis of 2.8 M. The fact the structures of the alkaloids lycorine, lycosinine, berberine, and lirodenin contain the 1,3 benzodioxole ring system suggests that this functional group might be involved in the inhibitory mechanism and other reported bioactivities.
