0: The fact that essential oils and oil compounds inactivated both pathogenic bacteria and  T. vaginalis suggest that oils/oil compounds that have been shown to inactivate foodborne microorganisms in vitro and in contaminated food might also be effective against  T. vaginalis.
1: For example, we reported that 27 of the evaluated 96 essential oils and 12 of the 23 essential oil compounds inactivated multiple species of foodborne pathogenic bacteria ( Campylobacter jejuni,  E. coli,  Listeria monocytogenes, and  Salmonella enterica) in vitro [ 75,  76].
2: Essential oils and oil compounds also inactivated pathogenic bacteria in apple juice [ 77], ground pork [ 78], and on leafy greens [ 79], suggesting that some of the commercially available, food-compatible essential oils/oil compounds might also inhibit the growth of pathogenic protozoa.
3: Will safe, food-compatible oils/oil compounds (e.g.
4: allspice, cinnamon, clove, lemongrass, oregano, and thyme essential oils) and their bioactive compounds (e.g.
5: carvacrol, cinnamaldehyde, citral, eugenol, geraniol, thymol) added to liquid and solid foods protect consumers against both microbial infections and trichomoniasis?
