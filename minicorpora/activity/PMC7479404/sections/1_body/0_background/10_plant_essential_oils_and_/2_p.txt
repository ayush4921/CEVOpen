0: Farias, Kato [ 13] found that essential oils from different  Nectandra plant species grown in Brazil contained a variety of compounds, including the phenylpropanoid derivative (+)--bisabolol (Fig.
1: 2).
2: The oil isolated from the leaves of  Nectandra megapotamica contained 93.7% (+)--bisabolol.
3: This compound inhibited biofilm formation in methicillin-resistant  Staphylococcus aureus and  Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria and was also active against  T. vaginalis with an IC 50 value of 98.7 g/mL.
4: It also had cytotoxic and hemolytic effects in Vero cells and human erythrocytes.
5: Oliveira, Freitas [ 74] found that (+)--bisabolol acted synergistically with the antibiotic drug gentamicin against  Escherichia coli.
6: These results suggest the potential value of  Nectandra oils and their bioactive compounds in the treatment of infectious diseases caused by clinical and foodborne pathogenic bacteria and by  T. vaginalis, as well its potential to protect foods against contamination by both microbial and protozoal pathogens.
