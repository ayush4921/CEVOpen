0: Beverages and foods rich in phytochemicals have also been shown to have inhibitory activity towards trichomonads.
1: For example, using a cell assay, Noritake, Liu [ 61] determined the inhibitory activities of black tea, green tea, grape, pomegranate, and jujube extracts and dried jujube against  T. vaginalis G3,  T. foetus D1, and  T. foetus C1.
2: The results show that the black tea extract inactivated the three trichomonads and was most effective against  T. vaginalis.
3: The extract was also effective against a metronidazole-resistant strain and a cytoadherent strain of  T. vaginalis.
4: The inhibition correlated with the total extract and individual component [(theaflavin, theaflavin 3-gallate, and theaflavin-3,3-digallate (Fig.
5: 1)] content of the extracts as determined using HPLC.
6: The black tea extract did not affect normal flora bacteria in vitro.
