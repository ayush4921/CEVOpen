0: Three publications by Sirk et al.
1: [ 67 69] describe studies on molecular-dynamics computer simulations of green tea catechins and black tea theaflavins and lipid bilayers of cell membranes.
2: The simulations show that the tea compounds have a strong affinity for the lipid bilayer; some are absorbed into the bilayer and some remain on the surface.
3: The molecular structure of the compounds influences their absorption, as well as the ability of their hydroxyl (OH) groups to form hydrogen bonds with the lipid bilayer headgroups.
4: Insight into these molecular events facilitates a better understanding of the mechanism of disruption of cell membranes in biological processes, including the anti-cancer, antibacterial, and antiprotozoal effects.
