0: The inactivation by the catechin-containing green tea and other extracts was variable and lower than that by the black tea extracts.
1: The authors suggest that black tea and its bioactive theaflavin compounds merit further human clinical studies with  T. vaginalis.
2: Related studies show that individual green tea catechins and black theaflavins and tea extracts inhibited the growth of pathogenic bacteria and viruses [ 62,  63], and multiple human cancer cells [ 64], and that the theaflavin and catechin content of 77 commercial green and black teas varied widely [ 65,  66], suggesting that clinicians and tea consumers should select teas with the highest content of the bioactive compounds.
