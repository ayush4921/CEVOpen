0: Wang [ 17] reported that the anthraquinone derivative emodin (1,3,8-trihydroxy-6-methyl-anthraquinone) (Fig.
1: 3) isolated from the root and rhizome of  Rheum palmatum inhibited the pathogenicity of  T. vaginalis in mice.
2: The compound delayed the development of subcutaneous abscesses due to infection by this parasite.
3: It also cured the intravaginal infection of trichomonads through oral administration.
4: In cell cultures, it reduced the cytotoxic effect of the parasite towards mammalian cells.
5: This inhibition was markedly reversed by the coexistence of free radical scavengers, indicating the possible mediation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the pathogenicity and inhibition.
6: Other investigators reported that emodin also inhibited breast cancer growth [ 97], showed antibacterial and antiviral activities when incorporated into model membranes (liposomes) as the vehicle [ 98], suppressed nonresistant and antibiotic-resistant pathogenic  Staphylococcus aureus bacteria [ 99], and protected against oxidative damage induced by oxidized fish oil [ 100], suggesting that the compound has the potential to improve both food safety and human health.
