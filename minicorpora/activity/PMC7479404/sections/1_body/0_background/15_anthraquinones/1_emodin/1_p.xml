<p id="Par50">Wang [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] reported that the anthraquinone derivative emodin (1,3,8-trihydroxy-6-methyl-anthraquinone) (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) isolated from the root and rhizome of 
 <italic>Rheum palmatum</italic> inhibited the pathogenicity of 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> in mice. The compound delayed the development of subcutaneous abscesses due to infection by this parasite. It also cured the intravaginal infection of trichomonads through oral administration. In cell cultures, it reduced the cytotoxic effect of the parasite towards mammalian cells. This inhibition was markedly reversed by the coexistence of free radical scavengers, indicating the possible mediation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the pathogenicity and inhibition. Other investigators reported that emodin also inhibited breast cancer growth [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>], showed antibacterial and antiviral activities when incorporated into model membranes (liposomes) as the vehicle [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>], suppressed nonresistant and antibiotic-resistant pathogenic 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> bacteria [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>], and protected against oxidative damage induced by oxidized fish oil [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>], suggesting that the compound has the potential to improve both food safety and human health.
