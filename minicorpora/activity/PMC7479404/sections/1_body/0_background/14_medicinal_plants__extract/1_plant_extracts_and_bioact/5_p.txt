0: Menezes, Rigo [ 20] evaluated the mechanism of the anti-trichomonad effect of phloroglucinol compounds isolated from a Brazilian  Hypericum plant species.
1: The compound isoaustrobrasilol B (Fig.
2: 2) significantly inhibited nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase (NDPDase) and ecto-5nucleotidase activities as well as immune changes attributed to extracellular nucleotide accumulation, suggesting that the death of  T. vaginalis cells and modulation of electonucleotidases induced by the phloroglucinol derivative may increase the susceptibility of the parasite to host immune cells (neutrophils), thus enhancing cell death.
3: A review of the literature of 26 plant types by Ziaei Hezarjaribi, Nadeali [ 91] indicates that extracts of medicinal herbs such as  Artemisia,  Zataria multiflora, and  Lavandula angustifolia are remarkably effective against  T. vaginalis, with the most effective  Artemisia aucheri extract active at a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL.
