0: Arthan, Sithiprom [ 30] investigated the effectiveness of compounds isolated from plants grown in Thailand against  T. vaginalis.
1: The MICs of several -glycosides at 24 h were in the range of 6.2512.5  M. The glycosides torvosides A and H (Fig.
2: 2) were more potent than their corresponding deglucosylated torvoside A and H, whereas other -glycosides were generally as active as their corresponding aglycones.
3: Except for dalcochinin, none of the tested compounds showed cytotoxicity against Vero and cancer cell lines (KB and MCF-7).
4: The native Thai plants provide another natural source of anti- T. vaginalis compounds.
