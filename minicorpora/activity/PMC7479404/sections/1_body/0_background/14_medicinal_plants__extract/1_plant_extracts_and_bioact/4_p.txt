0: Fernandez-Calienes Valdes, Monzote Fidalgo [ 32] found that extracts of leaves and stems of  Scutellaria havanensis, a plant native to Cuba, and the isolated flavonoid compound wogonin (Fig.
1: 2) exhibited anti-trichomonad activity against  T. vaginalis with the following selectivity indices: methanol extract 7.3; chloroform extract 2.8; wogonin 2.0; and metronidazole 322.6.
2: Because antiprotozoal efficacy must have a selectivity index of at least 10, defined as the ratio of concentrations that measures cytotoxic to antiprotozoal activity [ 90], the authors suggest that the observed activities are probably due to unspecific cytotoxic rather than specific anti-trichomonad effects.
3: The test substance also exhibited activity in vitro against  Plasmodium berghei parasites, suggesting their possible value against malaria.
