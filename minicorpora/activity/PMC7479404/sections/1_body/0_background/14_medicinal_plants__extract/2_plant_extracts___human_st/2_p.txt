0: Abdali, Jahed [ 94] used a randomized study of 420 women of reproductive age to determine the effect of a vaginal cream containing a medicine made from  Zataria multiflora (Labiatae family) against  T. vaginalis vaginal infections and bacterial vaginosis that often accompanies the protozoal infection.
1: The control group was administered oral metronidazole tablets.
2: The results show that the cream is as effective as the drug in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis ( p = 0.01) and clinical symptoms associated with  T. vaginalis ( p = 0.001).
3: The authors suggest that the cream should also be evaluated for the possible recurrence of  T. vaginalis following treatment.
4: A study by Sgibnev and Kremleva [ 95] found that twice daily intravaginal co-administration of 500 mg metronidazole with 1 capsule of the commercial probiotic Gynophilus to 90 women with  T.  vaginalis for 7 days significantly increased the therapeutic potency of the drug (88.6 and 42.9% for trichomoniasis and 63.6 and 11.9% for bacterial vaginosis (BV) treated with and without added probiotic, respectively).
5: The binary treatment also decreased the inflammatory response and the pH and increased the redox potential in the vagina.
6: The authors suggest that these changes are the reason for the increased therapeutic potency.
7: The binary therapy merits further study with some of the described highly active natural anti-trichomonad compounds and extracts.
8: A new vaginal cream containing a mixture of extracts of  Eucalyptus camaldulensis leaves , Viola odorata root, and  Mentha piperita leaf completely inhibited  T.  vaginalis strain G1 in vitro in the first 24 h, suggesting its potential value for human use [ 96].
