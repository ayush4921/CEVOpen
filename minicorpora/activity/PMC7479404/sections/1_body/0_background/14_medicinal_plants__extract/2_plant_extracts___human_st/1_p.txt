0: The following studies demonstrate the effectiveness of medicinal plants in alleviating trichomoniasis in women and another study shows the potential of microbiota to increase the therapeutic potential of metronidazole.
1: A randomized study by Moraes, Cunha [ 92] of the treatment of 60 Brazilian women infected with  T. vaginalis with 24 mg of the herbal plant  Mentha crispa (Lamiaceae family) or 2000 mg of secnidazole (5-nitroimidazole, structurally related to metronidazole) administered orally in tablet form, found that: (a) there was no statistical difference between the two treatments in the observed cure rates, 90 and 96.6% ( p = 0.621), respectively; (b) the adverse effects (mostly nausea, metallic taste) were significantly higher ( p = 0.05) in the secnidazole (66.66%) than in the  M. crispa group (20%),  p = 001).
2: The cited results show that  M. crispa seems to offer an alternative and safe treatment for trichomoniasis, and possibly also for giardiasis [ 93].
3: It is, therefore, surprising that  M. crispa has not been adopted for wider clinical evaluation and use in view of its striking beneficial effect at a much lower dose than the synthetic drug.
