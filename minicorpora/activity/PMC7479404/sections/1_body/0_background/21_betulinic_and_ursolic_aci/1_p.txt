0: Innocente, de Brum Vieira [ 12] found that betulinic and ursolic acids (Fig.
1: 2) and the piperazine derivative of betulinic acid inhibited the growth of  T. vaginalis.
2: The derivative showed greater activity than the parent compound.
3: Vieira, Silva [ 111] found that  Manika rufula plants from the Caatinga desert region of Brazil contained a number of characterized compounds that inhibited  T. vaginalis.
4: These included the -amyrin caproate, -amyrin caproate, lupeol acetate, and ursolic acid.
5: After incubation for 2 h, ursolic acid reduced about 98% of parasite viability and induced drastic ultrastructural alterations in the cells, as observed by scanning electron microscopy.
6: Bitencourt, de Brum Vieira [ 31] reported that the triterpene compound ursolic acid and its derivative, 3-oxime-urs-12-en-28-oic-ursolic acid, were active against fresh clinical isolates of  T. vaginalis with an MIC of 25 M. The derivative also inhibited a metronidazole-resistant  T. vaginalis isolate and was not active in a hemolysis assay or cytotoxic to Vero cells, suggesting its value as potential trichomonocidal agent.
7: Hubner, de Brum Vieira [ 112] also found that derivatives of betulinic acid inactivated  T. vaginalis.
