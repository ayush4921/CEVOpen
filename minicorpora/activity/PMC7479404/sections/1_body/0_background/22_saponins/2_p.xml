Additional studies of mechanistic interest show that the compound reduced the cytoadherence of the pathogen to host cells, did not affect ROS production by neutrophils, did not hemolyse erythrocites, and disrupted the cell membrane of the pathogen. The authors suggest that the trichomonocidal effect against
