0: Rocha, de Brum Vieira [ 27] found that saponins (glycosylated triterpenes) isolated from  Quillaja, Passiflora, and  Ilex plant species had high anti- T. vaginalis activity with an MIC of 0.025% .
1: All samples induced erythrocyte lysis and release of LDH.
2: An evaluation by Damke, Tsuzuki [ 28] of purified saponins of the medicinal plant of  Sapindus saponaria, used traditionally to cure ulcers, external wounds, and inflammation revealed their inhibitory potency against  T. vaginalis with an MIC value of 0.156 mg/mL for nonclinical strains and 0.078 mg/mL for a clinical strain.
