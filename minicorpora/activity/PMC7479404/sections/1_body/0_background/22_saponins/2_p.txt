0: An uncommon saponin ( saponin 1, Fig.
1: 2) isolated by de Brum Vieira, Silva [ 114] from the Brazilian medicinal plant  Manilkara rufula (Sapotaceae family) also known as macarunduba inactivated  T.  vaginalis in vitro without toxicity against the human vaginal HMVII cells, suggesting that the compound does not affect host cells.
2: Additional studies of mechanistic interest show that the compound reduced the cytoadherence of the pathogen to host cells, did not affect ROS production by neutrophils, did not hemolyse erythrocites, and disrupted the cell membrane of the pathogen.
3: The authors suggest that the trichomonocidal effect against  T.  vaginalis is due to profound cell membrane damage.
