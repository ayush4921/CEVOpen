0: The cited studies indicate the complexity of the anti-trichomonad mechanisms, where structurally different natural and synthetic compounds seem to act on metabolic pathways of the protozoa that are similar to or different from those observed with metronidazole.
1: Which mechanistic inactivation pathway of anti-trichomonad compounds will be effective against both susceptible and metronidazole-resistant protozoa strains in vivo?
