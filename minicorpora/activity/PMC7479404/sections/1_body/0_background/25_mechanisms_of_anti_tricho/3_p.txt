0: The results from two related studies show major differences in the content and metabolism of sulfur and other amino acids in the two trichomonad species.
1: Nozaki, Ali [ 130] reported that the metabolism of sulfur amino acids in  T.  vaginalis probably influences their virulence and defense against stress.
2: Based on an extensive bioanalytical study, Westrop, Wang [ 131] showed that there are major differences in cysteine and methionine synthesis and metabolism in  T.  vaginalis and  T.  foetus, that both trichomonads synthesize methylthioadenosine by an unusual mechanism, that  T.  foetus has higher levels of ornithine and citrulline than  T.  vaginalis and released high levels of the polyamine putrescine, and that  T.  vaginalis but not  T. foetus exported 2-hydroxyisocaproic acid derived from leucine.
3: Because these biochemical events and associated enzymes probably contribute to the viability of the protozoa, inhibition of the active sites of the enzymes might transform pathogenic to nonpathogenic trichomonads.
