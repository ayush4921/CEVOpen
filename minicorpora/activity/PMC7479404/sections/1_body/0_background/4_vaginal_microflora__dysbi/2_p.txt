0: A normal vagina is acidic with a pH of approximately 4 to 4.5 but can vary between 3.5 and 5.

2: It has been reported that there are five predominant microbiota states or community types (CSTs) that have been isolated from premenopausal women.
3: Four of these CSTs are dominated by  Lactobacillus spp.
4: The last CST (CST-IV), however, does not contain lactobacilli but rather the overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria i.e.
5: Gardnerella vaginalis,  Atopobium vaginae,  Prevotella bivia, and others [ 35 37].
