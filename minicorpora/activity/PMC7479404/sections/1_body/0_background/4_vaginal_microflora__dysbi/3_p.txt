0: The lactobacilli use glycogen from exfoliated epithelial cells, which is converted to lactic and fatty acids.
1: Additionally, these bacteria are able to produce other bactericidal products including hydrogen peroxide, bacteriocins, bacteriocin-like products, and surfactants that help in preventing infections [ 38,  39].
2: Products from various  Lactobacillus spp.
3: have been shown to inhibit or reduce adherence of urogenital pathogens via competitive exclusion of the host receptor(s) [ 38].
4: Phukan, Brooks [ 40] described the discovery of an aggregation promoting factor APF-2 from the vaginal strain  L. gasseri ATCC 9857 that inhibits  T. vaginalis adherence to human vaginal ectocervical cells.
5: Hinderfeld, Phukan [ 37] showed that  T. vaginalis and CST-IV associated-bacteria are correlated with  T. vaginalis infections [ 41], can enhance paracellular permeability of the cervicovaginal epithelium by dysregulating tight junctions, and affect proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-).
6: Valadkhani et al.
7: indicated the protective role of  Lactobacillus acidophilus in  T. vaginalis infection using healthy human vaginal cells [ 42].
8: Restoration of the vaginal microflora by both oral and vaginal delivery of prebiotics, probiotics, and/or synbiotics have been attempted for bacterial vaginosis, as well as for  T. vaginalis infection, with varying degrees of success dependent on strain(s) used, duration of treatment, route of delivery, and whether in combination with traditional drugs [ 39,  43].
9: This is therefore a potential strategy that could be investigated alongside the natural products that we will describe herein.
