<p id="Par20">Because vaginal dysbiosis is a contributing factor to trichomoniasis in women and because treatments applied vaginally should not upset this important ecosystem, it is worth considering the effects of this dysbiosis and how balance can potentially be restored with biotic treatments. The role of the “normal” microflora has been extensively studied, especially in relation to human gastrointestinal diseases and susceptibility to pathogens and toxins. The dysbiotic microflora environment can be reversed via treatment with prebiotics and/or probiotics such as lactobacilli with beneficial results for a variety of gastrointestinal diseases and reduced susceptibility to pathogens and pathogen products [

Dysbiosis or disturbance of this very important microflora in the vagina can lead to many severe adverse conditions including preterm birth, pelvic inflammatory disease, increased risk and transmission of sexually transmitted infections, along with many other health conditions [

Therefore, understanding the effects of the vaginal microbiome and its dysregulation on human health and susceptibility to trichomonad infection is of crucial importance. Additionally, researchers must understand the urogenital, and specifically the vaginal environment to safely and effectively deliver therapeutics to target the infection.
