0: Two investigations describe photodynamic treatment as a potential new anti-trichomonad therapy.
1: da Silva, Ribeiro Cde [ 118] found that exposure of  T. foetus protozoa to light sensitized with an aluminum phthalocyanine tetrasulfonated photosensitizer efficiently killed the bovine pathogen.
2: The associated morphological changes in the cells included membrane projections, nucleus fragmentation, endoplasmic reticulum proliferation, and cytoplasmic vacuolization, suggesting the possible value of the treatment for bovine trichomoniasis.
3: Silva Fonseca, Alacoque [ 119] exposed metronidazole sensitive and resistant  T. vaginalis strains to methylene blue as the light-emitting diode (LED).
4: They found that light alone was ineffective, but the sensitized light inhibited up to 81% of the nonresistant and 91.1% of the resistant strains, respectively.
5: The authors suggest that the effective photodynamic therapy offers great potential for routine use in women with trichomoniasis.
