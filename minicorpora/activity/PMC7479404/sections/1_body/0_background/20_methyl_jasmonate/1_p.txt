0: Because mitochondria are target organelles of jasmonates, plant lipids that act as stress phytohormones that help protect plants against stress conditions such as drought and phytopathogens, Ofer, Gold [ 24] wanted to find out if methyl jasmonate (Fig.
1: 2) would induce cell death in the amitochondriate  T. vaginalis (lacking mitochondria).
2: They found that cell death did occur following exposure of the parasite to methyl jasmonate and was associated with an apoptotic-like mechanism without the apparent DNA laddering sub G (1) cell cycle stage peak and caspase-3-activation, similar to the effect observed with metronidazole.
3: Additional studies showed that methyl jasmonate was also cytotoxic to a metronidazole-resistant strain of  T. vaginalis (ATCC 50143).
4: The authors suggest that the mitochondria-independent cytotoxicity of methyl jasmonate could enable it to serve as a potential new agent against trichomoniasis.
5: Vilela, Menna-Barreto [ 109] confirmed, using flow cytometry and scanning and transmission electron microscopy, that methyl jasmonate induced cell death and loss of hydrogenosomal membrane potential in  T. vaginalis.
