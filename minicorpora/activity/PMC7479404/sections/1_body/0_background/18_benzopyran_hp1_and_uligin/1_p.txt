0: Cargnin, Vieira [ 11] found that uliginosin B and three benzopyrans (Fig.
1: 2) isolated from  Hypericum polyanthenum, a Brazilian native plant, had anti- T-vaginalis activity that was associated with damage to the cell membrane (> 90% release of lactic dehydrogenase, LDH).
2: Benzopyran HP1 had the best activity against both susceptible and metronidazole-resistant clinical isolates (TV-LACM2), with no cytotoxicity towards mammalian cells.
3: The authors suggest that benzopyran HP1 with significant antiprotozoal activity and selectivity seems to be a promising candidate for further study.
