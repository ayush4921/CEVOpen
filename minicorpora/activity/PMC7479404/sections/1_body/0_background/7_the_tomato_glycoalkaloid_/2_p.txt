0: Because the aglycone tomatidine showed lower activity than the glycoside tomatine, it seems likely that the tetrasaccharide side chain is involved in the molecular mechanism of inactivation of the trichomonad cells, possibly by binding to and disrupting the cell membranes, as described by Blankemeyer et al.
1: [ 48,  49] and de Groot and Muller-Goymann [ 50].
2: It would be of interest to find out if inexpensive extracts of green tomatoes and tomato leaves with a high-tomatine content [ 51,  52] would also be effective against the human, bovine, and feline trichomonads.
