<p id="Par28">Tomatine has also been reported to have other health-promoting activities, such as reducing plasma cholesterol levels in hamsters [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], and in mice [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>], making it a good target for further investigation in human studies. Interestingly, tomatine content decreases as the fruit matures on the vine so green, unripe tomatoes can have about 100 times more tomatine than mature red [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], and tomatine is found in processed tomato products including sauce, ketchup, and pickled tomatoes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Jars of high-tomatine pickled green tomatoes are available in some stores.
