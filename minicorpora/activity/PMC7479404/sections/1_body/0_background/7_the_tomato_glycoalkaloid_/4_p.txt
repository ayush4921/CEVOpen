0: In related studies Chen, Li [ 58] showed that five glycoalkaloids, -chaconine, -tomatine, -solanine, -solamargine, and -solasonine, inhibited the growth of the malaria-causing protozoan  Plasmodium yoelii in a 4-day study in mice, suggesting that the last two compounds also merit evaluation against  T. vaginalis and  T. foetus.
1: Thorne, Clarke [ 59] reported that -chaconine, -tomatine, and -solasonine inactivated the herpes simplex virus Type I in cell culture, suggesting that these glycoalkaloids might show anti-viral properties against the coronavirus, human immunodeficiency (HIV), and other pathogenic viruses.
