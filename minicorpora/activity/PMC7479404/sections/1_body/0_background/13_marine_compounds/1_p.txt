0: There have been a few limited studies on effects of marine extracts and isolated compounds on  T. vaginalis.
1: A screen by Moo-Puc, Robledo [ 85] of 25 tropical seaweeds from the Yucatan coast of Mexico showed that 44% of the extracts had high to moderate activity against  T. vaginalis, with  Lobophora variegata and  Udotea conglutinata species showing the maximal activity with IC 50 values of 1.39 and 1.66 g/mL, respectively.
2: Cantillo-Ciau, Moo-Puc [ 86] reported that an extract from the alga  Lobophora variegata from the Yucatan coast of Mexico showed high activity against  T. vaginalis with an IC 50 value of 3.2 g/mL.
3: Several isolated and chemically characterized compounds were less active with an IC 50 value of 8.0 g/mL.
4: Scopel, dos Santos [ 87] found that two marine-associated fungal species ( Hypocrea lixii FO2 and  Penicillium citrinum F40) isolated from 39 different marine organisms, mainly sponges, from the South Brazilian coast showed up to 100% growth-inhibitory activity against  T. vaginalis fresh, clinical, and a metronidazole-resistant isolates at a concentration of 2.5 mg/mL.
5: The negative results of a hemolytic assay show that both samples were compatible with red blood cells, suggesting that these samples are potential candidates against  T. vaginalis.
6: The cited studies suggest that the sea algae, seaweed, fungal and other species could serve as a source of highly active anti-trichomonad formulations.
