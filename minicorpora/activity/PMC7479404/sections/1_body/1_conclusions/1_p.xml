<p id="Par75">The worldwide use of herbal medicines is increasing, although without the apparent adequate education of physicians and consumers about their efficacy and safety [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136">136</xref>]. It is therefore not surprising that plants and their extracts have become the focus of studies on their activity against pathogenic protozoa such as 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic>. The results of the studies cited here describe the potential of food, marine, and medicinal plant extracts and isolated pure compounds to inhibit the growth of 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> parasitic strains that cause the sexually transmitted disease trichomoniasis in humans and the inhibition of the related 
 <italic>T. foetus</italic> strains that infect farm and domestic animals. The studies indicate that some of the natural plant extracts and bioactive compounds are highly active against these parasites, suggesting that they might be able to fully or partially replace the widely used drug metronidazole, especially against resistant trichomonad strains.
