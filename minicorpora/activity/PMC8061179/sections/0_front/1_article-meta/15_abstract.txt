0: Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a fatal systemic disease of felids caused by a Coronavirus (CoV) (FIPV).
1: In spite of its clinical relevance and impact on feline health, currently the therapeutic possibilities for treatment of FIP in cats are limited.
2: The emergence of the pandemic Severe Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), etiological agent of the 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), able to infect a broad spectrum of animal species including cats, triggered the interest for the development of novel molecules with antiviral activity for treatment of CoV infections in humans and animals.Essential oils (EOs) have raised significant attention for their antiviral properties integrating and, in some cases, replacing conventional drugs.
3: Thymus vulgaris EO (TEO) has been previously shown to be effective against several RNA viruses including CoVs.
4: In the present study the antiviral efficacy of TEO against FIPV was evaluated   in vitro.
5: TEO at 27 g/ml was able to inhibit virus replication with a significant reduction of 2 log10 TCID  50/50 l. Moreover, virucidal activity was tested using TEO at 27 and 270 g/ml, over the cytotoxic threshold, determining a reduction of viral titre as high as 3.25 log10 TCID  50/50 l up to 1 h of time contact.
6: These results open several perspectives in terms of future applications and therapeutic possibilities for coronaviruses considering that FIPV infection in cats could be a potential model for the study of antivirals against CoVs.
