<p>This questionnaire included six statements and was adapted from a previous study by Thorens et al. (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). It investigated the expected side effects of psychotropic agents by patients (positive or negative changes in character or attitude), interference of treatment with religious beliefs, and opinions of the individuals surrounding the patient, and the use of alternative medicines (complementary medicine, homeopathy, and traditional medicines). These items were given as Yes/No questions.
