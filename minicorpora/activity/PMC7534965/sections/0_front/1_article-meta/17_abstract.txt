0: AbstractINTRODUCTION: Essential oils can serve as novel sources of antibiotics for multidrug-resistant bacteria.METHODS: The multidrug-resistance profile of a    Klebsiella aerogenes strain was assessed by PCR and sequencing.
1: The antibacterial activity of    Cinnamomum cassia essential oil (CCeo) against    K. aerogenes was assessed by broth microdilution and time-kill methods.
2: RESULTS:K. aerogenes showed high antibiotic resistance.
3: The genes    blaKPC-2,    ampC,    blaCTX-M-15,    blaOXA-1, and    blaTEM were present.
4: CCeo exhibited an inhibitory effect with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 17.57 g/mL.
5: CONCLUSIONS: The antibacterial activity of CCeo makes it a potential candidate for treating carbapenem- and polymyxin-resistant    K. aerogenes strains.
