<p>Genomic DNA was extracted from a fresh culture. The concentration and purity of the DNA were determined with a Qubit 2.0 fluorometer using the dsDNA BR Assay Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). A sequencing library was prepared using the Nextera library kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA). The DNA sample was sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq Platform (Illumina), as described by Dung et al.
