<p>The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of CCeo was determined by broth microdilution and by using a resazurin colorimetric assay
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>13</sup>
 </xref>. The tested concentration range of CCeo was 72,000 μg/mL-2.197 μg/mL. The time-kill method was performed using the broth macrodilution technique
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>14</sup>
 </xref>. The concentration of CCeo and polymyxin B tested represented the MIC value. Time-kill studies were performed with approximately 1.5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU/mL. A positive control of tigecycline was used at twice the MIC value, since the studied strain had an intermediate sensitivity to this antibiotic and there was no sensitivity to other pharmacological classes. A negative control of brain heart infusion broth was used for the bacterial strain, and saline was used as sterility control.
