<p>Our results suggest that the CCeo antibacterial action mechanism is complex. Several pathways may be involved in the inhibitory effects of this oil against bacterial cells, making it difficult to elucidate them all. Multiple experiments are necessary in order to evaluate all possible mechanisms and provide an insight into the molecular actions of CCeo. The antimicrobial activity of essential oils may involve single or multiple targets. Therefore, the mechanisms of action cannot be attributed to a unique site, but rather to a cascade of reactions involving the entire bacterial cell
