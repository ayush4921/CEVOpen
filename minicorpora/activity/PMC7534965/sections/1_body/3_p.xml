 </xref>. An important characteristic in essential oils is their hydrophobicity, which allows them to interact with the lipids in the bacterial cell membrane and disturb the bacterial structure, thereby making it more permeable and leading to the leakage of ions and various molecules from the bacterial cells. Although the extravasation of cellular components can be tolerated without loss of viability, further loss of cellular content or the loss of critical molecules and ions can lead to cell death
