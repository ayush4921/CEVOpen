0: Ocimum basilicum essential oil (EO) was evaluated for its biological effects on   M. domestica.
1: Characterization of   O. basilicum EO revealed the presence of methyl chavicol (70.93%), linalool (9.34%), epi--cadinol (3.69 %), methyl eugenol (2.48%), -cadinene (1.67%), 1,8-cineole (1.30%) and (  E)--ocimene (1.11%).
2: The basil EO and its constituents methyl chavicol and linalool elicited a neuronal response in female adults of   M. domestica.
3: Adult female flies showed reduced preference to food source laced with basil EO and methyl chavicol.
4: Substrates treated with EO and methyl chavicol at 0.25% resulted in an oviposition deterrence of over 80%.
5: A large ovicidal effect was found for   O. basilicum EO (EC  50 9.74 mg/dm  3) followed by methyl chavicol (EC  50 10.67 mg/dm  3) and linalool (EC  50 13.57 mg/dm  3).
6: Adults exposed to EO (LD  50 10.01 g/adult) were more susceptible to contact toxicity than to methyl chavicol and linalool (LD  50 13.62 g/adult and LD  50 43.12 g/adult respectively).
7: EO and its constituents methyl chavicol and linalool also induced the detoxifying enzymes Carboxyl esterase (Car E) and Glutathione S  transferases (GST).
