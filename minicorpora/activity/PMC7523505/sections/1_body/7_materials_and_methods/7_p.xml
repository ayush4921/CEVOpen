 </xref> Briefly, 100 µL of the dilution of the EO in RPMI 1640 with MOPS was mixed with 100 µL of the prepared standard fungal cell suspensions (1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/mL) in a 96 well sterile flat bottomed polystyrene microtiter plate followed by aerobic incubation at 37ºC for 24 h. After incubation, plates were visually observed for the presence and absence of growth (turbidity of the suspensions). Minimum concentration of the treatment without any turbidity was considered as MIC point.
