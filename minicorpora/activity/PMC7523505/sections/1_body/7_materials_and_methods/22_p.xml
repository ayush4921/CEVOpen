 <italic>Minimum toxic concentration for forming biofilms (MTC)</italic> - MTC determines the minimum concentration of 
 <italic>C. verum</italic> leaf oil requires to kill the forming biofilms of 
 <italic>Candida</italic> spp. completely. The CFU assay was used to detect the MTC of the oil on forming biofilms. After the 24 h treatment with different concentrations of 
 <italic>C. verum</italic> leaf oil, the mass of the adhered biofilm was scraped using a sterile cell scraper and thoroughly homogenised in 100 µL of sterile normal saline and then the suspension was serially diluted (10
 <sup>-1</sup> to 10
 <sup>-6</sup>). Subsequently, an aliquot of 100 µL was plated on SDA medium. Agar plates were incubated at 37ºC for 24 h. After incubation, the colony forming units were counted and the results were expressed in CFU/mL.
