<p>Sterile cover slips were placed in 12-well cell culture cluster separately. Coverslips were immersed in 1 mL standardised cell suspension (1 x 10
 <sup>7</sup> cells/mL) to ensure uniform 
 <italic>Candida</italic> adhesion and incubated for 120 min at 37ºC in a shaker incubator (Nova Instruments, Brazil). Then the cover slips were moved carefully using a sterile forceps and gently immersed in new 12-well plate containing 0.5 mg/mL, 1.0 mg/mL and 2 mg/mL 
 <italic>C. verum</italic> oil in RPMI 1640 (1 mL/well). Coverslips were incubated aerobically for 24 h at 37ºC. After 24 h incubation, the cover slips with formed biofilms in the presence of EO dilutions were subsequently washed three times with sterile PBS. Then they were transferred to a new 24-well cell culture cluster containing 2.5% glutaraldehyde at 4ºC. After fixing with glutraldehyde for 60 min, samples were dehydrated in a series of ethanol solutions (70% for 10 min, 80% for 10 min, 95% for 10 min and 10 min in absolute ethanol), and air-dried overnight in an incubator prior to sputter coating with gold. Chlorhexidine digluconate (0.25 mg/mL and 0.125 mg/mL) and Fluconazole (0.008 mg/mL) were used as positive controls to compare the post-exposure biofilm architecture with common antifungals and
