 <italic>Biofilm progression analysis (Time Lapse Microscopy)</italic> - Progression of 
 <italic>Candida in-vitro</italic> biofilms in the presence of 
 <italic>C. verum</italic> leaf oil was evaluated using Time Lapse Microscopy. For analysis of biofilm progression in the presence of 
 <italic>C. verum</italic> leaf oil, 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> (ATCC MYA-2876); 
 <italic>C. dubliniensis</italic> (ATCC MYA-646) and 
 <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> (ATCC 750) were adhered on to the polystyrene surface of 24-well cell culture cluster and treated with three concentrations (0.5 mg/mL, 1.0 mg/mL and 2.0 mg/mL) of 
 <italic>C. verum</italic> leaf oil as explained previously. During the 24 h incubation at 37ÂºC after adding the treatment, images of forming biofilms were captured at time 0, 4 h, 8 h, 12 h, 16 h, 20 h and 24 h using time-lapse microscope
