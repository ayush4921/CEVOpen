 <italic>Effect on biofilm development in the presence of (EO)</italic> - 100 μL of standard inoculum of each organism was inoculated to a 96-well sterile flat bottomed microplate plate, followed by aerobic incubation for 120 minutes under agitation (75 rpm at 37ºC)( Nova Instruments, Brazil). The plate was then washed once with sterile PBS and 100 μL of the each dilution of the essential oil was added separately to the treatment wells. 100 μL of RPMI 1640 buffered with MOPS was added to the growth control wells and buffered RPMI 1640 with 0.05% Tween 80 was added to negative control wells instead of oil.
