 <italic>Minimum biofilm inhibitory concentration of forming biofilms</italic> - In this experiment, minimum concentration of 
 <italic>C. verum</italic> leaf oil required to inhibit the biofilm formation by 50% (compared to negative control) was determined. Biomass/viability of formed biofilms in the presence of essential oil was determined using XTT viability assay. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref> showed the percentage reduction of XTT metabolic activity of forming biofilms compared to negative control.
