<p>Among all 
 <italic>Candida</italic> species, 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> is the most frequent etiological agent in cases of fungal infections, being associated in up to 50% of cases of this disease.

 </xref> This species has the capacity to adapt and proliferate easily in the environment of the human body, in several places. This ability to survive in different tissues of the human body is related to its capacity for morphological transition between hyphal form and yeast form.

 </xref> According to Mayer et al., hyphae and yeast, are involved in the infection process, and the yeast, being smaller, is able to disseminate, while the hyphae invades the host tissue by penetrating the epithelium with the help of proteinases and phospholipases enzymes, escaping from phagocytic cells.

 </xref> Another factor associated with virulence of 
 <italic>Candida</italic> spp. is the ability to form biofilms, promoting cell adhesion and formation of the extracellular matrix of the biofilm, as well as the synthesis of proteins that favor its further adhesion. The biofilm structure increases the resistance to antimicrobial agents, due to the difficulty of penetration into the extracellular matrix, and the action of the immune system, besides allowing the increase of the gene expression of mechanisms of resistance to antifungals as the efflux pumps.
