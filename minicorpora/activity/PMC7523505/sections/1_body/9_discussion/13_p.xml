<p>In conclusion, this study provides evidence for the high efficacy of 
 <italic>C. verum</italic> leaf EO as an anti-virulence approach against three key virulence factors of 
 <italic>Candida</italic> spp., adhesion, germ tube formation and biofilm formation. The EO extracted from 
 <italic>C. verum</italic> leaves has eugenol as its major active component and is non-toxic against 
 <italic>G. mellonella</italic> larvae.
