<p>Biofilm progression under the chemical stress of 
 <italic>C. verum</italic> leaf oil was visualised with time lapses microscope and results obtained from this experiment confirm above observation. 2 Ã— MTC (2 mg/mL) of 
 <italic>C. verum</italic> EO completely inhibited biofilm development of all test strains from time 0 h whereas slight cellular proliferation and biofilm development was observed in progressing 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> with MTC (1 mg/mL) from 0h to 8 h. After 8 h, no visible biofilm development was noted in 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> developing biofilms. 
 <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> and 
 <italic>C. dubliniensis</italic> biofilm development was completely inhibited at 0 h by MTC. Sub-MTC (0.5 mg/mL) causes retardation of biofilm development of all tested 
 <italic>Candida</italic> strains. These results indicate the possible effective use of 
 <italic>C. verum</italic> leaf EO as a biofilm preventive strategy. Further, data from SEM and time lapses microscopy reveal that the effect of EO on the progression of 
 <italic>Candida</italic> biofilm is dose dependent.
