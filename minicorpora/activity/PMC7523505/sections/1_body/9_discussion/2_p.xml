<p>Adhesion to the host surfaces or abiotic surfaces is the very initial step of colonisation of the microbial pathogens. 1.0 mg/mL concentration of EO reduced adhesion of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> by 50%, whereas, &gt; 2.0 mg/mL and 0.34 mg/mL concentrations of oil reduced 
 <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> and 
 <italic>C. dubliniensis</italic> adhesion by 50% respectively. Reference antifungal chlorhexidine digluconate exhibited 50% of reduction in adhesion to 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, 
 <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> and 
 <italic>C. dubliniensis</italic> with the concentrations of 1.06 mg/mL, 0.72 mg/mL and 1.32 mg/mL. Importantly, 50% reduction of adhesion of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>C. dubliniensis</italic> was achieved with lower concentrations of 
 <italic>C. verum</italic> leaf oil compared to chlorhexidine digluconate control which indicates the higher efficacy of 
 <italic>C. verum</italic> EO in anti-adhesion of those two strains. According to data obtained, 2.0 mg/mL chlorhexidine digluconate completely inhibit the adhesion of all test strains, but the observation may be due to killing of organisms completely during test period (2 h). Since adhesion on to the host surfaces is one of the major virulent factor and initial step of biofilm formation, the anti-adhesion properties of 
 <italic>C. verum</italic> EO on 
 <italic>Candida</italic> spp. contributes to itsâ€™ aptness as an antimicrobial agent.
