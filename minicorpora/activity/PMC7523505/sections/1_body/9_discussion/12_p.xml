<p>Though a number of 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in-vivo</italic> studies have used plant derived natural products for the treatment of 
 <italic>Candida</italic> infections, the exact mechanism of action of the antifungal effect or the effect on Candidal physiology of those treatments were not clearly understood. The 
 <italic>C. verum</italic> leaf EO used in the present study is a herbal product with potential for non-toxic therapeutic application in the treatment of candidiasis by interfering the virulence of 
 <italic>Candida</italic>. However, further experiments including 
 <italic>in-vivo</italic> toxicity investigations and clinical trials as well as molecular studies on gene regulation are recommended to develop an antifungal agent based on 
 <italic>C. verum</italic> leaf EO.
