0: BACKGROUND Essential oils (EO) extracted from    Cinnamomum verum has been used as an antimicrobial agents for centuries.
1: The effects of    C. verum leaf oil against virulence of microorganisms is not well studied yet.
2: OBJECTIVES This study evaluates the effect of    C. verum leaf oil against three virulence factors of    Candida albicans,    C. tropicalis and    C. dubliniensis and its    in-vivo toxicity.
3: METHODS Chemical composition of EO was determined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).
4: Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined using clinical and laboratory standards institute (CLSI) M27-A3 broth microdilution.
5: Effect of EO on initial adhesion was quantified using XTT assay after allowing    Candida cells to adhere to the polystyrene surface for 2 h. Biofilm formation of    Candida in the presence of EO was quantified using XTT viability assay.
6: Efficacy on reduction of germ tube formation was evaluated using standard protocol.
7: Visualisation of biofilm formation and progression under the EO treatment were done using scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Time lapses microscope respectively.
8: In-vivo toxicity of EO was determined using    Galleria mellonella larvae.
9: Chlorhexidine digluconate: positive control.
10: RESULTS Eugenol was the main compound of EO.
11: MIC was 1.0 mg/mL.
12: 50% reduction in initial adhesion was achieved by    C. albicans,    C. tropicalis and    C. dubliniensis with 1.0, > 2.0 and 0.34 mg/mL respectively.
13: 0.5 and 1.0 mg/mL significantly inhibit the germ tube formation.
14: MBIC   50 for forming biofilms were  0.35 mg/mL.
15: 1.0 mg/mL prevent biofilm progression of    Candida.
16: SEM images exhibited cell wall damages, cellular shrinkages and decreased hyphal formation.
17: No lethal effect was noted with    in-vivo experiment model at any concentration tested.
18: CONCLUSIONC.
19: verum leaf oil acts against virulence factors of    Candida and does not show any toxicity.
