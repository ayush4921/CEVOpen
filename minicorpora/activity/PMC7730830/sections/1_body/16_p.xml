<p>The antioxidant activity was also the subject of studies by Tavarini et al. [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-25-05769" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The authors focused on the best cultivating conditions for production of 
 <italic>Stevia rebaudiana</italic> (plant species with South-American origin) bioactive compounds. They studied the influence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi symbiosis, phosphorus fertilization, and harvest time on the accumulation of secondary metabolites, including stevia glycosides, flavonoids, and total phenols, in the plant leaves. All investigated factors influenced the stevia metabolite yield. The authors documented that in vitro antioxidant capacity (FRAP and ORAC assays) depended on polyphenols and glycosides, while cellular antioxidant activity (CAA) mostly on total phenols. The authors proposed the best cultivation conditions to obtain a high-value plant raw material for the food and cosmetics industries.
