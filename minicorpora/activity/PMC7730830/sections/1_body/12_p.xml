<p>One of the articles written by Ilina et al. [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-25-05769" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] established the immunomodulating activity of 
 <italic>Galium aparine</italic> (plant species common in Europe, North Africa, and Asia) and partly justified the traditional use of this plant species in skin and wound infections. The studies tested the activity of a raw infusion of the aerial parts of the plant and bioactive fractions (with polysaccharide complex, polyphenolic complex, and pectins). All fractions significantly stimulated the transformation of immunocompetent blood cells. All samples also displayed antioxidant activity (DPPH, NO, H
