<p>Makowski et al. [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-25-05769" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] present the effects of biotic (
 <italic>Cronobacter sakazakii</italic>) and abiotic (shaking—hydromechanical stress) elicitation of cells from in vitro culture of the carnivorous endemic plant species grown in North and South Carolina—
 <italic>Dionaea muscipula</italic>. The best results (increase in fresh weight, higher total phenolic content, elevated synthesis of phenolics, and plumbagin) were observed after the combined elicitation. The authors also estimated the antioxidant and antibacterial activity. A higher antioxidant activity of the extracts corresponded with a higher phenylpropanoid content. The authors concluded that only in vitro culture should be proposed for pharmaceutical purposes, because the natural populations of this plant species are very limited.
