<p>In another article by Gaweł-Bęben et al. [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-25-05769" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], comparative phytochemical and biological activity studies of hydroglycolic extracts from flowering aerial parts of 
 <italic>Achillea millefolium</italic> (Am) and 
 <italic>Achillea biebersteinii</italic> (Ab) collected in Kazakhstan were performed. The aim of the study was to evaluate potential cosmetic application of (Ab). Extracts from (Ab) possessed more diverse composition than (Am) and displayed significant antiradical, tyrosinase inhibitory, and sun protective properties. In contrast to (Am), (Ab) extracts were cytotoxic against the human malignant melanoma cell line and showed a lower cytotoxicity against non-cancer keratinocytes. The extracts of (Ab) could be proposed as multifunctional ingredients of cosmetics, but their safety and irritating potential should be investigated in the next step of research.
