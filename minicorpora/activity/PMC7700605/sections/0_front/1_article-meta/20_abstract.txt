0: The objective of this study was to evaluate wild growing   Satureja kitaibelii,   Thymus serpyllum,   Origanum vulgare,   Achillea millefolium and   Achillea clypeolata with respect to their essential oil (EO) content, composition and antimicrobial activity.
1: The five species were collected at Mt.
2: Rtanj and the village of Sesalac, Eastern Serbia.
3: The main EO constituents of Lamiaceae plants were   p-cymene (24.4%), geraniol (63.4%) and germacrene D (21.5%) in   Satureja kitaibelii,   Thymus serpyllum and   Origanum vulgare ssp.
4: vulgare, respectively.
5: A. millefolium EO had multiple constituents with major ones being camphor (9.8%), caryophyllene oxide (6.5%), terpinen-4-ol (6.3%) and 1,8-cineole (5.6%), while the main EO constituents of   A. clypeolata were 1,8-cineole (45.1%) and camphor (18.2%).
6: Antimicrobial testing of the EO showed that   Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive) was more sensitive to all of the tested EOs than   Escherichia coli (Gram-negative).
7: S. kitaibelii EO showed the highest antimicrobial activity against both tested bacterial strains.
8: This is the first study to characterize the EO composition and antimicrobial activity of these five medicinal species from Eastern Serbia in comparison with comprehensive literature data.
9: The results can be utilized by the perfumery, cosmetics, food and pharmaceutical industries, but also for healing purposes in self-medication.
