<p>The major constituent of extracts and EO used in traditional medicines as an antimicrobial agent is 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene [

 <italic>p</italic>-cymene exhibited the weakest antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-25-05482" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Contrarily, limonene exhibited moderate antibacterial activity against these bacteria [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-25-05482" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], while linalool exhibited strong antimicrobial activity [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-25-05482" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. It is well known that many plants exert their beneficial effects through the additive or synergistic action of several chemical compounds acting at single or multiple target sites [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-25-05482" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The results from this study suggest that the combination effects of these compounds (
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene, limonene and linalool) in 
 <italic>S. kitaibelii</italic> EO had antibacterial enhancement (synergistic or additive effects) against tested bacteria (
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>). Further investigations into this topic need to be conducted.
