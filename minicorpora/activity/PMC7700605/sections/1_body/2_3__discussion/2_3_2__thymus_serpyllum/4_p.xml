<p>Previous research reported that geraniol exhibited good antimicrobial activity and, in combination with antibiotics, would have substantial therapeutic potential against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> infections [

 <xref rid="B61-molecules-25-05482" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Taking into account the moderate antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, EOs of 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> (with geraniol and nerol) could be used as herbal supplements to conventional therapy.
