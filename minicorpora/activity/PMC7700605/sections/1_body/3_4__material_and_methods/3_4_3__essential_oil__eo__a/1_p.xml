<p>Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was performed using an HP 5890 coupled with an HP 5973 MSD fitted with an HP-5MS capillary column (conditions in detail described by Aćimović et al. [
 <xref rid="B101-molecules-25-05482" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]). The components were identified based on their linear retention index relative to C8–C32 n-alkanes, in comparison with data reported in the literature (Wiley and NIST databases). The percentage (relative) of the identified compounds was computed from the GC peak area.
