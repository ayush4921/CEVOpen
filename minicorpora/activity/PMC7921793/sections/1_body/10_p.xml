<p>In conclusion, the present research topic includes a wide range of interdisciplinary research work that contributed to our goal of expanding knowledge on NAMPs including their new sources, identification, isolation, characterization, bioactivity, molecular mechanism and the structure-activity features. This research topic successfully gathered comprehensive information on some specific NAMPs related to the field of antibiotic discovery from natural sources. Furthermore, this topic provided insights into potential use of ethnopharmacological approaches to discover new lead NAMPs molecules for antibiotic therapy. We hope that this special collection will help and inspire scientists from different research fields to suitable use of gathered knowledge for the discovery of novel antibiotics using natural AMPs.</p>
