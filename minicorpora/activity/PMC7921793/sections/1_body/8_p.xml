<p>Small-angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) is a powerful technique to study protein structures and when the SAXS performed in biological samples it is termed as BioSAXS. BioSAXS helps to understand about the sizes, shape, movement, protein functions in cells which support in drug design and discovery (

 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA) as well as further studied the ultrastructural changes in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and MRSA in response to these AMPs using the BioSAXS technique. It was found that the after treatment of either AMP the ultrastructure of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and MRSA to be different and the scattering curves for both cells was much more alike. Their results demonstrated that BioSAXS could help to elucidate the mode of action of AMPs that can contribute in the development of antibiotics against resistant bacteria.
