<p>Due to rapid raising of antibiotic resistance, new emerging tactics are compulsory to develop new antimicrobial drugs. Discovery of new antimicrobial agents through scientific evaluation of traditional medicines involved ethnopharmacological approaches (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Cox and Balick, 1994</xref>). Ethnopharmacology has already proved to be an innovative approach for drug discovery (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">SÃ¼ntar, 2020</xref>). The discovery and development of a number of modern drugs were the credit to ethnopharmacology. Ethnopharmacological approaches focus on the people-nature interface and covers the past, present and future uses of natural resources that has contribution in maintenance of human health by opening essential clues for new drug discovery. The ultimate goal of this research topic is to update knowledge on NAMPs and their ethnomedicinal uses in preventing and managing infections in human, plant or animal, and future research directions for the discovery of new antibiotics from NAMPs. This special issue consists of six articles that cover diverse areas of research related to NAMPs and ethnopharmacology. A number of review articles in this issue have focused the reports on the correlation of ethnobotanical/ethnopharmacological data with the exploration of new AMPs. It also covers research articles that showed the discovery of wound healing AMPs from bottle fly larvae which has been used in ancient Maggot debridement therapy for the treatment of chronic infections. This research topic included a wide range of interdisciplinary research that ultimately focused our goals of boosting the knowledge of scientific field of ethnopharmacology for the discovery of lead NAMPs as a novel antibacterial agents.
