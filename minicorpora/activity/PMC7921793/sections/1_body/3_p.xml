<p>Plants are capable of producing structurally diverse of compounds which serves as a specific function for plant itself including their communication, protection, defense or growth. The protection of plant from pathogenic infections have already been reported that they can develop different constitutive and inducible protection mechanisms via morphological barriers, secondary metabolites or AMPs (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Benko-Iseppon et al., 2010</xref>). From traditional knowledge human have learned to use these chemicals in their own needs especially as a form of medicines. These secondary metabolites of plants have been served as a treasured of bioactive constituents that used in traditional medicines for the treatment of infectious diseases since ancient time. It is reported that plants are an important source of different AMPs and a number of AMPs have already been identified from different parts of plant which discovered via using the knowledge of their ethno-medicinal or traditional uses against infection (
