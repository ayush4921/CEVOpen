<p>Natural antimicrobial peptides (NAMPs) belong to different peptide or protein families that are found in all classes of life as a part of innate immune responses as well as barrier defense (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Diamond et al., 2009</xref>). Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been reported to act as broad spectrum antibiotics that kill bacteria, viruses, fungi as well as cancerous cells and demonstrated as a potential source of new antibiotics (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Ageitos et al., 2017</xref>). Because of their promising activity and future prospects, over the last twenty years there has been growing interests in AMPs research and therefore the list of identified NAMPs has been growing day-by-day. Compared to conventional antibiotics, NAMPs have more unique features (

NAMPs have also been found to be stable in various conditions and possesses low to no toxicity in humans which make them prospective candidate to develop new antibacterial leads (

These natural resources could have ethnomedicinal uses against infections which open essential clues for the discovery of new NAMPs. Recent reports demonstrated that more than 1,500 NAMPs have been identified from nature and a number of these NAMPs currently under clinical or preclinical trials including kalata B1 and B2, novexatin, omiganan, pexiganan, thionins, and thioneinetc (
