<p>The Solanaceae family consists of approximately 2,700 species that distributed in about 98 genera including both economic and medicinal plants (

They highlighted the importance of plants of the Solanaceae as potential sources of NAMPs by summarizing reported AMPs from these plants with their possible molecular mechanism of action as well as further correlated the traditional uses of these plants with their reported AMPs.
