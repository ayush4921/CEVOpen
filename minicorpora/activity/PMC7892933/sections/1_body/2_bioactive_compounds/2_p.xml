<p id="p0065">The genus 
 <italic>Leea</italic> belongs to the Vitaceae family is a very large family having a large number of medicinal plants. Therefore, it is difficult to carry out a detailed chemical literature review of all the plants belong to this family. Due to this shortcoming, an extensive chemical review of the 
 <italic>Leea</italic> plants available in Bangladesh was carried out and claimed to possess mainly flavonoids, glycosides, phenols, terpenoids, steroids, volatile oils, alkaloids, tannins, saponins, and many other organic compounds [
