<p id="p0180">In this review, a general view of the previous research on the species of the 
 <italic>Leea genus</italic> has been summarized and focused to outline the information regarding the traditional uses, bioactive phytochemicals and pharmacological potentials of the 
 <italic>Leea</italic> plants. The 
 <italic>Leea</italic> genus contains around 70 species, which are widely used as TM in many countries, including Bangladesh due to their therapeutic potentials in various ailments or disorders such as diabetes, diarrhea, wounds, inflammation, hepatotoxicity, neural disorders, cancer, renal impairments and microbial infections. Moreover, several phytochemicals such as alkaloids, terpenoids, flavonoids, tannins, steroids, glycosides, phenolics, proteins and carbohydrates present in these plants are shown to exhibit pharmacological activities justify the use of these plants as TM. Only a few of the species of 
 <italic>Leea</italic> genus have been investigated for their chemical constituents and pharmacological activities. Hence, there are enormous scopes for further scientific investigation to establish 
 <italic>Leea</italic> plants as a potential source of novel drugs.
