 <xref rid="bib87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Most of the antipyretics work by inhibiting the enzyme cyclooxygenase and by reducing the levels of PGE
 <sub>2</sub> within the hypothalamus. Antipyretics cause the hypothalamus to override a prostaglandin-induced increase in temperature [
 <xref rid="bib88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. The body then works to lower the temperature, which results in a reduction in fever. The methanolic extract of 
 <italic>Leea rubra</italic> roots reduced fever induced by yeast suggested that the plant has antipyretic effect [

 <italic>Leea</italic> genus might have potent antipyretic activity, as 
 <italic>Leea rubra</italic> showed.
