<p id="p0165">Anti-nociception is the process or action of blocking the detection of a painful or injurious stimulus by sensory neurons. Anti-nociceptive agents are the substances that inhibit nociception (the sensation of pain). Anxiolytic agent inhibits anxiety (an emotion characterized by feelings of tension) and anxious thoughts and reduces high blood pressure. Like diazepam, the aqueous extract of 
 <italic>Leea guineensis</italic> leaves exhibited dose-dependent anti-nociceptive and anxiolytic activities [

 <italic>Leea macrophylla</italic> exerted anti-nociceptive activity [
