<p id="p0140">Hepatotoxicity means liver damage or injury caused by chemicals called hepatotoxins. Hepatoprotection or antihepatotoxicity is the ability of a drug to prevent damage to the liver. Plant extracts can be the best source of antihepatotoxic and mediate hepatoprotective activity. The methanolic extract of 
 <italic>Leea asiatica</italic> leaves produced hepatoprotective activity by lowering the level of serum SGOT, SGPT, ALP, total bilirubin, total cholesterol and triglyceride in acetaminophen-induced experimental model [

 <italic>in vivo</italic> study conducted by Ajiboye etÂ al., (2014) stated that the aqueous seed extract of 
 <italic>Leea guineensis</italic> showed hepatoprotective activity against DDVP-induced oxidative stress by altering the levels of increased lipid peroxidation and enhancing decreased activities of antioxidative enzymes such as catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase [

 <italic>Leea macrophylla</italic> leaves partially improved the hepatic damage in CCl
 <sub>4</sub>-induced Wistar albino rats and prevented oxidative damage as well [

 <italic>Leea</italic> genus indicate their wide variety of protective activity of liver.
