<p id="p0125">The wound is an injury to the body that typically involves laceration or breaking of a membrane and usually damage to the underlying tissues.

Healing a wound properly and timely, all the four phases of healing should be done sequentially and appropriately [

 <italic>Leea asiatica</italic> showed significant wound healing effects [

 <italic>Leea macrophylla</italic> root tubers produced significant wound healing [
