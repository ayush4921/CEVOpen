<p id="p0115">Cancer is defined as a disease in which a group of cells grow uncontrollably and rapidly by disregarding the normal rules of cell division. It is noted that cancer develops when the body loses its own control mechanism, leading to conversion of normal cells into cancer cells [
 <xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Anticancer activity is the activity of an agent or substance against cancer. The agent may be a natural or synthetic or chemical substance that can reverse, suppress or prevent carcinogenic progression. There are many 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> methods that are considered to estimate anticancer properties of natural products. More than 80% of existing anticancer drugs were derived from plants. Like wise, the mollic acid α-L-arabinoside and mollic acid β-D-xyloside of 
 <italic>Leea indica</italic> leaves showed cytotoxic effect on CaSki (cervical cancer) cells [
 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The methanol, ethanol and aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>Leea indica</italic> leaves exerted 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> growth inhibitory effect against two prostate cancer cell lines (DU-145 and PC-3) [
 <xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. A separate study conducted by Rainah et al., (2012) reported that the methanolic extract of the leaves of 
 <italic>Leea indica</italic> showed antitumor activity against Ehrlich Ascites Carcinoma cells in Swiss albino mice [
