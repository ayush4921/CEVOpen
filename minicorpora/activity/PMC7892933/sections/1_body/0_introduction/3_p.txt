0: Plant-based systems continue to play an essential role in healthcare, and their use by different cultures has been extensively documented.
1: According to WHO, the number of plants used for treatment is estimated to be 20,000 named as medicinal plants.
2: The studies on medicinal plants and active substances derived from these have increased the interest in these plants recent years [ 7].
3: There are about 45 plant families with 4000 genus that contain these medicinal plants.
4: Leea is one of these.
5: Leea possesses approximately 70 species that are distributed throughout the Northern and Eastern Australia, New Guinea, South and Southeast Asia and parts of Africa.
6: According to APG IV system,  Leea is placed in the subfamily of Leeoideae (Vitaceae) [ 8].
7: Leea is often placed in its own family, Leeaceae, on the basis of morphological differences between Leeaceae and Vitaceae.
8: These differences include the ovule number per locale, carpel number, the absence or presence of a staminoidal tube and floral disc.
9: Pollen structure has also been examined for taxonomic demarcation and concluded that the pollen structure of Leeaceae and Vitaceae suggests that the families should remain separate while other studies concluded that  Leea should be included in the Vitaceae family [ 9].
