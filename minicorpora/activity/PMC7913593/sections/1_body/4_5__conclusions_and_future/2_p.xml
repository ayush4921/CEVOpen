<p>One of the most spectacular uses of MAPs is in the biotechnological domain, where omics technologies have a crucial role. For an increased production of natural bioactive compounds, the elucidation of the biosynthetic pathway will help directly and efficiently obtain active compounds of different plants in hairy roots systems. In addition, a good knowledge and usage of biotic and abiotic elicitors can dramatically improve the production of targeted active compounds. If some studies proposed an exact methodology and models for the biosynthesis and regulation of active compounds (for example, in 
 <italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza</italic> Bunge., as previously presented), further studies are needed for other medicinal plants and for similar developments.
