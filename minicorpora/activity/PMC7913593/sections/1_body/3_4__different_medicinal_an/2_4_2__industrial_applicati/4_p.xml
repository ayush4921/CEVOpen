<p>In addition to these applications, there are edible coatings, which are considered as a part of the final product, and they are used to increase the oxidative stability during the storage of different foods; this approach is considered a preservation technique. Hosseini and coworkers developed a recipe based on whey protein concentrate, carboxymethyl cellulous, glycerol, and rosemary extract to improve the color and oxidative properties of the stored sunflower seeds [
