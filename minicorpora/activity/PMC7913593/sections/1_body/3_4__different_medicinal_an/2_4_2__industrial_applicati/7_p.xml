<p>Instead of synthetic additives, which are toxic and harmful to humans and the environment, the interest regarding the application of natural extracts from plants in this area has increased. These substances can be successfully applied as additives in steel production for developing corrosion-resistant materials [

The beneficial effects of the newly developed coatings can be increased by decreasing the cost of production, natural compounds being a cheap raw material, but the disadvantage of their use is over the long term, being degradable under specific conditions (UV light, the possibility of oxidizing or evaporating) [
