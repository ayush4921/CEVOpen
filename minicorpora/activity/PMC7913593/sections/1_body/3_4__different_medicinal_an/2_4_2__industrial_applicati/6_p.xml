<p>In addition, MAPs, such as 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> subsp. Hirtum, 
 <italic>Foeniculum vulgare</italic> Mill, 
 <italic>Pimpinella anisum</italic> L., and their extracts can be used as a novel feed additive in turkey production, having beneficial effects, such as food microbial safety or even can enhance production performance [

 <italic>Lavandula vera</italic> DC, 
 <italic>Artemisia absinthium</italic> L.) or even plant extracts (as a whole) have potential applications in the cosmetic industry, which nowadays is focused on new technologies and explores alternative sources of raw materials; the trends in this direction are based on the use of plant-origin components having polyfunctional properties and long-lasting effects [

 <italic>Rosa damascene</italic> flower extracts, aromatic compounds isolated from lichens, flowering tops of 
 <italic>Dracocephalum moldavica</italic> and 
 <italic>Viola tricolor</italic>, and aromatic and flavonoid compounds from saffron,
