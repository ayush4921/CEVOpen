<p>In the food industry, natural compounds can be used as natural packaging materials, which have the ability to increase the shelf life of meat products. Encapsulated in chitosan particles, these compounds can protect against different bacteria (
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spp., 
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes,</italic> etc.), and moreover, they have the property to inhibit lipid oxidation [

 <italic>Polylophium involucratum</italic> was developed for prolonging the shelf life of chicken fillets during refrigerated storage for 10 days [

These packaging films used for removing adverse sensorial properties due to microbial attack are environmentally friendly materials that are beneficial for human health, replacing petroleum-based plastic packaging. Rehman et al. presented different plants such as 
 <italic>Syzygium aromaticum</italic>, 
 <italic>Mentha piperita</italic>, 
 <italic>Salvia rosmarinus</italic>, or 
 <italic>Eucalyptus globulus</italic> as potential natural sources for food packaging [
