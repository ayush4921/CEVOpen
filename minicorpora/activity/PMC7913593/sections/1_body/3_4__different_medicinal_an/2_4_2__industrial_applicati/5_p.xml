<p>With a special respect to the natural products recipe, a great development started in the last few years for natural insecticidal recipes, which are less harmful to humans and the environment. 
 <italic>Th. alternans</italic> and 
 <italic>T. montanum</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>Jailae</italic> were studied by Pavela and coworkers as insecticide against 
 <italic>Musca domestica</italic> L., 
 <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> Say, and 
 <italic>Spodoptera littoralis</italic> (Boisd.) [
 <xref rid="B113-ijms-22-01521" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. The insecticidal effect can be attributed to the synergistic effect of the individual compounds found in these species, and further studies are needed in order to elucidate the mechanism of action.
