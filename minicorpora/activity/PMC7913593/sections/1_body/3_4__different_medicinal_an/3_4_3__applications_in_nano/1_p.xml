<p>In the last decades, nanotechnology has offered a series of valuable tools for improving our daily life. Within this area, the application of different plants (including MAPs) led to the development of a new research field, nanoparticles phytosynthesis. As a general rule, the plantâ€™s phytoconstituents, acting as both reducing and capping agents, determine the final morphology and size of the obtained nanoparticles as well as contribute to an increase in biological activity and a reduction of potential toxicity. Our group previously reviewed the most recent findings in the application of phytosynthesized NPs as antimicrobial and antitumoral agents, as well as the results regarding their toxicological potential [

 <italic>Salvia hispanica</italic> L., or 
 <italic>Tribulus terrestris</italic> L. (just to name few examples) offer proper extracts to obtain silver, gold, or ZnO nanoparticles. Moreover, these nanoparticles, in particular those phytosynthesized with the help of medicinal plants such as 
 <italic>Artemisia vulgaris</italic> L., can find application in other medical applications, such as antiviral agents for chikungunya virus [
