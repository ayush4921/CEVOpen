<p>The mechanism of cellular action of these nanoparticles is similar for several types of application: the nanoparticles have the ability to inhibit the cellular mechanism by DNA damage, which is conducive to the death of the target cell. In addition, the formation of reactive oxygen species, including hydrogen peroxide, leads to oxidative stress and subsequent cell damage [
