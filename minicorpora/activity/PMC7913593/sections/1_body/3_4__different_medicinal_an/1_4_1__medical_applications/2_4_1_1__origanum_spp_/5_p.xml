<p>OEO is known as one of the best candidates to be used as preservatives against the 
 <italic>Bacillus</italic> species (associated with food spoilage), which is a property attributed to the presence of oxygenated terpenes (terpenoids) [

 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Salmonella typhimurium,</italic> and 
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>) [

 <xref rid="B89-ijms-22-01521" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. OEO can reduce the water vapor permeability (WVP) and enhance the contact angle, transparency, and moisture value of final films containing it, which is necessary for the development of different coatings.
