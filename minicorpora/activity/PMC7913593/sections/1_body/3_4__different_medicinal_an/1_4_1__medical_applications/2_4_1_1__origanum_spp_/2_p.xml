<p>Even if it is used as such or encapsulated in different matrixes, the oregano essential oil (OEO) has predominant medical applications. In the last few years, researchers reported in vitro antibacterial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities for the essential oil [

 <xref rid="B79-ijms-22-01521" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>], in the year 2020, Khan and co-workers reported the results of an in vivo study regarding a wound healing based on capsules of co-polymer of poly (L-lactide-co-caprolactone) (PLCL)/silk fibroin loaded with different concentrations of OEO [

In addition, it has the property of boosting the granulation, re-epithelialization, better organization of collagen fibers, as well as capillary network formation. Avola and coworkers described biological effects of OEO in the restoring of physiological cell homeostasis, using human keratinocytes NCTC 2544 treated with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and histamine (H) [
 <xref rid="B81-ijms-22-01521" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. OEO diminished the release of a variety of pro-inflammatory mediators such as iNOS (inducible nitric oxide synthase), ICAM-1 (inter-cellular adhesion molecule 1), and COX-2 –(cyclooxygenase-2), reducing ROS development, 8-OHdG (8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine) formation, and maintaining the protein proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression without influencing cell viability. The OEO was proven to play an important role in preserving the extracellular matrix components, remodeling, and tissue healing. For re-epithelialization of the skin after its injury, OEO has the property of improving NCTC 2544 cell proliferation. In this study, the beneficial effects were attributed to carvacrol, which is the main constituent in OEO.
