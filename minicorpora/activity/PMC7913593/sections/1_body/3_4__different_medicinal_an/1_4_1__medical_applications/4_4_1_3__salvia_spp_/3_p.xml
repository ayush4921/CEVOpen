The mixture of the compounds has the ability to inhibit the formation of acellular capillaries (which can be related to the development of vascular aneurysms), as well as regulator effect on glucokinase induction, AMPK-α/phosphorylated AMPK-α, insulin receptor substrate-1, and PPARγ, thus mediating the glucose metabolism.
