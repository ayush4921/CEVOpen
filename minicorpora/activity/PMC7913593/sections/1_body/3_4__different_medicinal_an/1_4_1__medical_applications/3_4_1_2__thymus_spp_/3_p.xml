<p>In 2020, Najafloo and coworkers published a review paper that presented the applications in the area of antibacterial wound dressing of thymol-incorporated materials, based on essential oil’s therapeutic properties: antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, local anesthetic, antinociceptive, cicatrizing, antiseptic, and particularly antibacterial and antifungal [

These delivery systems can be formed by lipid-based nanocarriers, polymer-based nanoparticles, fiber capsules, or hydrogels, all of them having application in wound treatment, the active bio-compound thymol, having the property to modulate the release production of reactive species, including nitric oxide, TNF-α, and IL-1β cytokines and growth factors such as TGF-1β, thus stimulating re-epithelialization, angiogenesis, and the formation of granulation tissue.
