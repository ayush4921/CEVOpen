<p>In addition, terpenes extracted from the aerial parts of 
 <italic>Thymus</italic> spp. are potent cardioprotective agents, protecting against biochemical and histopathological changes in the heart tissue of animals by restoring the activities of endogenous antioxidant enzymes [
 <xref rid="B97-ijms-22-01521" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. At heart diseases, there is an increased generation of reactive oxygen species such as superoxide anion (O
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>−</sup>) and hydroxyl radicals (OH
 <sup>−</sup>), and thymol has the ability to remove the damage of ROS, increasing the endogenous antioxidant enzyme activities such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), or glutathione-s-transferase (GST). Other applications to be further developed using the main constituents of 
 <italic>Thymus</italic> spp. in different forms can be beneficial in biomaterials development and tissue regeneration; recent studies [

 <italic>Thymus</italic> spp., their application in this area should definitely be explored.
