<p>In the last years, the application of neoteric solvents received special interest, in order to minimize the use of toxic components and maximize the extraction efficiencies, with an emphasis on reducing their toxicity after usage [
 <xref rid="B59-ijms-22-01521" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. This category includes ionic liquids and deep (natural) eutectic solvents, which were used due to their possibility toward tailored-extraction, thus increasing extraction efficiency for complex matrixes. Ionic liquids are suitable for different bioactive compounds, such as alkaloids [

 <xref rid="B61-ijms-22-01521" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] due to the good miscibility of target compounds with the solvent. Eutectic solvents have the same properties with ionic liquids, and beside this, they are less toxic and more biodegradable [
 <xref rid="B62-ijms-22-01521" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. In addition, bio-based solvents received special interest, such as 2-methyltetrahydrofuran, limonene, or 2-methyltetrahydrofuran, successfully replacing solvents such as n-hexane and toluene with lower production costs and increased biodegradability [
 <xref rid="B63-ijms-22-01521" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Some of these solvents are not commercially available, and they are not still used at an industrial level. Nowadays, the experiment must be carried out with respect to the balance between environment and production costs, in order to achieve full sustainability in the process implementation.
