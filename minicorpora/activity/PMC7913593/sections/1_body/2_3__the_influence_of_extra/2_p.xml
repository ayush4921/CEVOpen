Alcohols have the property of increasing cell permeability by affecting the phospholipid bilayer of the membrane, permitting a good transfer of bioactive compounds into the solvent. In addition, the water/alcohol mixtures permit a good recovery yield, especially for phenolic compounds, which have a good solubility, due to the alcohol presence (
