<p>The role and optimization of time, pH, solidâ€“liquid ratio, or pressure are discussed in different papers [

 <xref rid="B67-ijms-22-01521" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,

 <xref rid="B70-ijms-22-01521" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], as these are significant parameters that can influence the extraction efficiency. Moreover, it cannot be stated than one parameter is more important than another, each of them having a tremendous influence on the overall extraction process results.
