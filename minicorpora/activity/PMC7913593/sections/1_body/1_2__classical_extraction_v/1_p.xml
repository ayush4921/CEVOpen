<p>Classical methods were developed during the time, such as a simple approach involving only water, herbs, and energy [
 <xref rid="B19-ijms-22-01521" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. During the optimization process, the economic costs and energy necessary for obtaining different bioactive compounds tends to decrease, leading to higher yields of target compounds. Instead of maceration, decoction, or infusion, in the past, researchers developed methods such as Soxhlet, Clevenger, Kumagawa, or Likens–Nickerson simultaneous distillation–extraction, which, in turn, are replaced in the present day with modern equipment such as microwave-assisted extraction, supercritical fluid extraction [
 <xref rid="B20-ijms-22-01521" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], or ultrasound-assisted extraction [
 <xref rid="B21-ijms-22-01521" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Some examples are presented in
