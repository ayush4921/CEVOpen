<p>From the data presented in 
 <xref rid="ijms-22-01521-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, it can be seen that for the same plant, extraction conditions may vary, depending on each method: for classical methods, the extraction time and the amount of solvent used are higher than for modern techniques compared to the obtained extraction yield (i.e., 
 <italic>Satureja hortensis</italic> L. or 
 <italic>Hippophae rhamnoides</italic> L.), thus leading to new approaches and perspectives. Recently, researchers proposed the introduction of a “
 <italic>Green Certificate</italic>”, which is based on weighted penalty points and the use of a color code in which reagent toxicity and volume, energy consumption, and the quantity of generated wastes (in the extraction step) are the main parameters used for the quantification of the “green” character [
 <xref rid="B39-ijms-22-01521" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="B40-ijms-22-01521" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,
 <xref rid="B41-ijms-22-01521" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. All of these parameters contribute to a “greener character of the technique”, which is sometimes more important than the easiness of obtaining results. The classical approaches usually provide the lowest green certificate values, which is due to the energy and high amounts of solvents consumption. The “green certificate” is based on the application of a color code associated to a letter, class A being the “greenest” one [
 <xref rid="B41-ijms-22-01521" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The selection of a suitable solvent is crucial to improve the extraction yields, and moreover, the amount of resulted waste after the extraction. Polar solvents are commonly used, such as ethanol, methanol, and isopropanol [
 <xref rid="B42-ijms-22-01521" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], but the trends in “
 <italic>green chemistry</italic>” are going toward novel solvents with less toxicity as natural deep eutectic solvents (NADES) [
 <xref rid="B43-ijms-22-01521" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Espino and coworkers developed and optimized ultrasound-mediated extraction for phenolic compounds from 
 <italic>Larrea cuneifolia</italic> Cav. 1800, which is a medicinal plant from the 
 <italic>Larrea</italic> genus used in the Argentinian folk medicine [
 <xref rid="B44-ijms-22-01521" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. They chemometrically optimized the extraction conditions, obtaining better results than using classical solvents in terms of resulted wastes: thus, for conventional techniques (maceration, decoction, heat reflux), wastes are in the range 1.5–2.85 penalty points for waste calculated according to the methodology previously mentioned [
 <xref rid="B39-ijms-22-01521" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="B40-ijms-22-01521" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,
 <xref rid="B41-ijms-22-01521" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], while for modern techniques, such as microwave and ultrasound-assisted extractions, wastes are in the range of 1–1.5 penalty points for waste, which are calculated according to the same protocol. These values of penalty points of the wastes offer a green certificate of class A (with a value in the range 100–90) and class B (89–80). Considering the results presented by the authors, the use of NADES and modern extraction techniques (such as ultrasound extraction) could be successfully applied for the scale-up of the procedure.
