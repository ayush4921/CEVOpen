<p>A proper balance in choosing the methods and setting operational parameters could lead to an optimized process, obtaining different compounds from a plant matrix, which in other conditions would be damaged or could not be obtained [

The structure of target molecules can influence their solubility at different conditions of high pressure; in extreme conditions, interactions and aggregations or even their re-adsorption are possible. Using moderate conditions such as medium pressures or temperatures automatically can result in lower costs and energies, which is beneficial for all the production and processing chain. Moreover, for modern extraction methods, for which it is not necessary to use organic or toxic solvents, the obtained bioactive compounds could achieve, in certain conditions, a “green characteristic” and can be used in further applications such as the design of foods with improved functionality or medical care.
