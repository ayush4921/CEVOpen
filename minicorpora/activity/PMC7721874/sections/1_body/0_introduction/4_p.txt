0: TG/DTG/DTA is a useful thermo-analytical technique to investigate the mass loss of a sample as a function of time or temperature.
1: The decomposition temperature corresponding to the maximum slopes of each mass-loss stage recorded on the ThermoGravimetric curve is seen as a peak when the Derivative ThermoGravimetric (DTG) curve is plotted 17.
2: This technique was used to characterize the thermal stability of some essential oils, i.e.
3: orange, lemongrass, and basil oil 15, as well as to evaluate the activation energy for the evaporation of lavender, cypress, tea tree, clove, eucalyptus, etc.
4: oils 13,  16.
