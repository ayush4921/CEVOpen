<p id="Par35">The SHEOx-y samples were obtained from SHEO (1 mL) through different heating temperatures (160, 175, 190 ºC) and periods (0.5 and 2.5 h) in open glass vials using a drying oven (Model FD23, Binder, Germany) with temperature control. The mass loss determined for the essential oil during heat treatment, at 160 °C, 175 °C, and 190 °C, respectively is 31.17%, 41.43%, 96.10% after 30 min, and 84.33%, 96.85%, and 99.79% after 2.5 h. We chose these three heating tempratures as we classified the compounds determined in the essential oil in three classes: a) compounds with boiling point &lt; 160 °C, b) compounds with boiling point 160–190 °C; c) compounds with boiling point &gt; 190 °C. Also we chose two periods of heating: 0.5 h and 2.5 h to observe the time-related behavior of the essential oil.</p>
