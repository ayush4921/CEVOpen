<p id="Par41">The FT-IR spectra of essential oil samples were recorded using Bruker Vertex 70 spectrophotometer equipped with the ATR cell, on the 600–4000 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> wavelength range with a resolution of 4 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and 32 scans. For each analyzed sample, a background measurement was performed. The spectra were processed using OPUS software. The recorded FT-IR spectra were normalized (min–max), and the baseline-corrected.
