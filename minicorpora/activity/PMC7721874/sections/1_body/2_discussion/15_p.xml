<p id="Par27">All changes observed in the thermal behavior of SHEOx-y samples compared to SHEO are due to the changes that occurred in the chemical composition after heating, as can be seen from the GC–MS and FT-IR results. The decrease in 
 <italic>γ</italic>-terpinene + 
 <italic>α</italic>-terpinolene content observed in the GC–MS analysis as well as the diminishing of the specific bands intensity (2818, 946 and 781 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>) in the FT-IR spectra of SHEOx-y samples, demonstrates that after heating the samples to 175 ºC these monoterpenes are eliminated from the oil through vaporization. In the case of SHEO190-2.5, the total absence of the specific bands for γ-terpinene and its isomer α-terpinolene was observed while an significant increase of intensity for carvacrol specific bands took place.
