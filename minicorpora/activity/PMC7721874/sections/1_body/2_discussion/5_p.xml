 <sup>-</sup>. The data shown inhibition varying from 80 to 87.7% for the analyzed samples, which implicates remarkable antioxidant activity. The higher inhibition was observed for the heated essential oils (SHEO190-2.5), which presents the highest level of carvacrol 87.73 ± 0.08% compared with no treated oil (SHEO) 80.02 ± 0.24%. The phenolic hydroxyl group, which is present in carvacrol is a good H donor and can react with reactive oxygen species disabling the reaction of making newer radical generations

 <sub>onset</sub> for unheated essential oil was at 124.8 ºC, and after the heating treatment, T
 <sub>onset</sub> got up to 171.1 ºC, making the essential oil more antioxidant and increase the thermal stability.
