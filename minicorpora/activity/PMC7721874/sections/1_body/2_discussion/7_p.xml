<p id="Par19">Another major component in the SHEO composition, identified in the GC–MS analysis is 
 <italic>γ-</italic>terpinene which presents the characteristics signals in ATR-FTIR spectra located at 781 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>due to C–H out of plane bending (strong), 946 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> due to C–C stretching (strong to weak), and 2818 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> due to C–H stretching (medium to strong) 
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>
 </sup>. Most of the terpenoids show also wagging vibrations of C–H and CH
 <sub>2</sub> groups, e.g. 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene at 813 and 1516 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> ⍺-terpinolene at 781 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, α-pinene at 886 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, β-pinene at 873 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, caryophyllene at 885 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>

 <italic>p</italic>-cymene, the other two characteristics bands were recorded for SHEO at 1056 and 1018 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively, that were assigned to 
 <italic>para</italic>-substitution

 <sup>−1</sup> are due by symmetric and asymmetric bending of isopropyl groups
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>
 </sup>, and the signal from 1516 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> is due by waging vibration of C–H(CH

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>
 </sup>. The bands located between 1590–1659 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> are due by C=C stretching vibration

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>
