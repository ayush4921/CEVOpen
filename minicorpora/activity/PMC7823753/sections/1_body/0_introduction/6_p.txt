1: [ 12] have described the anthocyanin profile of lemon bottlebrush ( Callistemon citrinus (Curtis) Skeels) flowers by RP-HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS/MS analysis of an anthocyanin enriched fraction of acidified methanolic extract and performed a deep analysis of its antioxidant, cytoprotective, and anti-angiogenetic properties.
2: The work led to the identification of four anthocyanins: cyanidin-3,5- O-diglucoside (cyanin), peonidin-3,5- O-diglucoside (peonin), cyanidin-3- O-glucoside, and cyanidin-coumaroylglucoside-pyruvic acid.
3: The abilities of cultivation, robustness, and adaptability to different environments make the plant a useful source of anthocyanins, which show interesting applications due to their unique structural/chemical features.
4: The anthocyanin-enriched fraction of acidified methanolic extract is able to actively scavenge DPPH, ABTS, and AAPH radicals and to counteract -carotene bleaching.
5: Based on these data, the effects of hydroxylation and methoxylation at the level of the B ring have a remarkable effect on antioxidant activity and the basic structure of anthocyanins.
6: Moreover, they protect human mononuclear cells from oxidative injuries and prevent angiogenesis.
