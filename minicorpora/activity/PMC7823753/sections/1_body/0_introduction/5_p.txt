1: [ 15], starting from the recent observation that melatonin can be considered a growth regulator with multiple physiological functions in plants and its exogenous application can decrease the deleterious effects of drought stress, have analyzed foliar application of melatonin to tomatoes under long-term optimal and deficient irrigation conditions to improve crop productivity and quality.
2: In the range of 040 ppm, melatonin increases plant growth, total fruit yield, quality attributes (soluble solids, ascorbic acid, and lycopene content), chlorophyll content, and antioxidant enzyme activities (such as ascorbate peroxidase, catalase, and peroxidase), with a concomitant reduction of the amino acid proline, soluble sugars, H 2O 2, and dangerous substances (such as malondialdehyde) derived from oxidative injuries to cellular components, suggesting the possible utilization of melatonin under specific conditions and in enhancing tomato tolerance to deficient irrigation.
3: The stress tolerance topic has also been analyzed by Buttar et al.
4: [ 15].
5: The authors have analyzed the protection mechanism of melatonin on wheat seedlings treated with heat stress.
6: Their results show the involvement of melatonin in modulating the antioxidant defense system, with the activation of the ascorbateglutathione cycle, the stabilization of photosynthetic machinery by increasing the chlorophyll amount, and the induction of the expression of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-related genes, TaSOD, TaPOD, and TaCAT, and anti-stress responsive genes, such as TaMYB80, TaWRKY26, and TaWRKY39.
