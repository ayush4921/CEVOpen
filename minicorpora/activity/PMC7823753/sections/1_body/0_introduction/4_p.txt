0: Three works (two articles and one review) focused on the properties of melatonin.
1: Melatonin is an interesting molecule with complex functions and potentiality [ 10, 15, 16].
2: Khan et al.
3: [ 16] have analyzed the mechanism of exogenous melatonin in various crops that can improve plant growth and development in response to various abiotic and biotic stresses by regulating antioxidant machinery in plants (both the enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant defense systems), with a concomitant decrease in lipid peroxidation and plasma membrane damage.
4: They highlight that some aspects have been elucidated, but a detailed transcriptomic analysis is required to reveal the gene regulatory networks involved in the effects of exogenous melatonin application.
