The bergamot essential oil without furocoumarins showed remarkable antioxidant activity that may contribute to inhibiting carrageenan-induced paw edema in rat and it shows analgesic properties. This paper provides new insight on the mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity of bergamot essential oil (BEO). Because of the well-known toxicity of furocoumarins, authors performed this study using the BEO fraction deprived of these compounds (BEO-FF). To study the BEO-FF mode of action, it was used the carrageenan-induced hind paw oedema, a suitable experimental model of acute inflammation. In this context, BEO-FF exerted a significant inhibition of paw oedema due to a reduction of interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-Î± levels in the paw homogenates, as well as nitrite/nitrate and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) content in exudates. In order to evaluate the anti-nociceptive activity of BEO-FF, and to distinguish between peripheral and central analgesic effects, authors carried out both writhing and hot plate tests in mice. Results of the former one showed that BEO-FF elicited a pronounced analgesic response, likely due to the inhibition of nociceptive mediators release, whereas the results of the latter one suggested that the supra-spinal analgesia participated in the anti-nociceptive effects of BEO-FF.
