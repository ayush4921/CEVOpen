2: The study reported an analysis of polyphenol, protein, nitrogen, mineral, sugar, pyruvate, antioxidant, and -amylase inhibition activities of red onion cultivars, sweet Italian and honeysuckle, grown in California and Texas, respectively.
3: Cyanidin-3-(6-malonoylglucoside) and cyanidin-3-(6-malonoyl-laminaribioside) were the major polyphenols present in the cultivars, as evident from the principal component analysis of different cultivars of red onion.
4: Cyanidin derivatives possessed strong antioxidant activity and are responsible for the inhibition of -amylase.
