0: Never, in this hard year, has the necessity to develop alternative solutions and strategies to fight microorganisms and viruses been so timely.
1: Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection is very common in humans and is associated with oral mucocutaneous lesions and/or genital infections.
2: In the article entitled In Vitro Anti-HSV-1 Activity of Polyphenol-Rich Extracts and Pure Polyphenol Compounds Derived from Pistachios Kernels ( Pistacia vera L.), the authors [ 7] have reported on the activity of polyphenol-rich extracts of pistachio kernels on HSV-1 replication.
3: The results obtained showed that pistachio polyphenols have remarkable inhibitory activity against HSV-1.
4: Natural compounds could become great candidates for the development of novel topical or oral drug formulations to treat HSV-1 infections, either alone or in combination with standard antiviral therapies.
