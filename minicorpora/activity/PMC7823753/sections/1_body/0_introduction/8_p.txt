1: [ 8] have analyzed the influences of monoterpenes of  Trachyspermum ammi on the viability of spermatogonia stem cells.
2: Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to evaluate the expressions of several genes (promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein, DNA-binding protein inhibitor, tyrosine protein kinase, B-cell lymphoma 2, and Bcl2-associated X protein) after treatment with oil obtained by hydrodistillation.
3: The results reveal a correlation with the amount of oil used, in particular with thymol, suggesting its role in the improved quality and viability of spermatogonia cells in cell culture and the activation/blocking of specific signals inside the cells.
