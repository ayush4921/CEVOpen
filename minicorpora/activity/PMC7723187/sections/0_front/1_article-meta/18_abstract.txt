0: AbstractToday, food consumers prefer to use the foods that contain natural preservatives.
1: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of Qodume Shirazi seed mucilage (QSSM) and lavender essential oil (LO) on the preservation of ostrich meat during cold storage.
2: The chemical compounds of LO were identified through gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GC/MS).
3: The ostrich meat samples were coated with the mucilage containing the essential oil at concentrations of 0%, 0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, and 2%, v/v.
4: The control and the coated ostrich meat samples were kept at 4C and analyzed for microbiological (total viable count, psychrotrophic count,   Escherichia coli,   Staphylococcus aureus, coliforms, and fungi), physicochemical (moisture content, pH, texture, and color parameters), and sensorial (odor, color, and total acceptance) characteristics during 9 days of storage.
5: GC/MS identified 12 compounds in the essential oil, among which linalool was the major one (43.3%).
6: The lightness (L* value) and hardness of all the ostrich meat samples were reduced during the storage.
7: From a microbiological point of view, the cold storage duration for the control and the coated sample without the essential oil was only 3 days, while for coated samples containing 0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, and 2% essential oil, it was 3, 3, 6, and 9 days, respectively.
8: The coated ostrich meat containing 2% LO had an appropriate quality with an expanded shelf life.
9: The results showed that neural network with 10 neurons in the hidden layer had the lowest mean squared error and mean absolute error and the highest correlation coefficient for predicting the quality and microbial properties of the coated meat samples during storage.
