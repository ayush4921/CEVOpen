<p>Ostrich meat is considered as a healthy alternative to other red meats in Western societies due to its favorable nutritional properties and one of the most popular sources of protein (low cholesterol and intramuscular fat contents and generally high omega‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA x3) percentages). In recent years, there is an increasing trend toward consumption of ostrich meat. Therefore, improving the quality and increasing the shelf life of this product are very important both for local consumption and for export. Much research has been done to prevent microbial growth and sensory properties of ostrich meat. Factors such as initial microbial loads, packaging atmosphere, pH, storage temperature (and temperature abuse), and sampling day could affect the quality of ostrich meat (González‐Montalvo et al.,

For example, the relatively high pH of ostrich meat is one of the factors that can cause rapid microbial spoilage in some packaging conditions. Another factor that may cause ostrich meat spoilage is its the higher polyunsaturated fatty acid content as compared to beef and chicken meats, which makes ostrich meat to be more sensitive to oxidative deterioration (Divani et al.,
