<p>Chemical composition and applications of water‐soluble gums, also called hydrocolloids, used in foods have been well documented. Most hydrocolloids are polysaccharides (gum Arabic, guar gum, carboxymethylcellulose, carrageenan, starch, and pectin) or proteins (such as gelatin). Hydrocolloids are widely used in the food industry in food systems for a variety of purposes, for example, as gelling agents, stabilizers, texture modifiers, and thickeners (Koochaki et al.,
