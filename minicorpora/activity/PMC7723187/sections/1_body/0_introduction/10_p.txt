0: Qodume Shirazi ( Alyssum homolocarpum) seed mucilage (QSSM) has a great potential to be used as a new source of biodegradable film due to its suitable thickening/gelling action.
1: The majority of QSSM is carbohydrate (85.33%) with small amount of uronic acid (5.63%).
2: QSSM has low molecular weight (3.66  10 5 Da) with relatively flexible chain and medium intrinsic viscosity (18.34 dl/g) at 25C.
3: The major sugar compositions of QSSM are galactose (82.97%), glucose (5.7%), rhamnose (5.04%), xylose (2.72%), mannose (3.04%), and arabinose (0.53%), and it is likely a galactantype polysaccharide.
4: QSSM behaves like a typical polyelectrolyte because of the presence of carboxyl and hydroxyl groups.
5: Mucilage extracted from Qodume Shirazi seed can be used as thickening, fat replacer, and stabilizer agent (Monjazeb Marvdashti et al.,  2019).
