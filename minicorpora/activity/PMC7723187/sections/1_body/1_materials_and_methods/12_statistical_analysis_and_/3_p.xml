<p>An artificial neural network (ANN) consisting of a set of interconnected neurons is able to estimate outputs based on input and data. The designed lattice type was multilayer perceptron (MLP) in which the input layer consisted of 2 neurons (LO concentration and shelf life) and the output layer contained 5 neurons (moisture content, color index, total microbial load, hardness, and pH). Levenberg–Marquardt (LM) training algorithms were used to update the ANN weights. This algorithm is one of the most commonly used algorithms because it makes network training very fast and minimizes the level of error. In fact, this algorithm is designed to increase network learning speed based on the Hessen matrix (Salehi &amp; Razavi,
