<p>Hydrodistillation method using a Clevenger‐type apparatus (power: 335 W; duration: 3 hr) was utilized to extract the essential oil from lavender. Quantification of LO components was performed using a Beifen 3420A gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies 7890 A) equipped with a split injector, a flame ionization detector, and a DB‐5 capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm stationary phase thickness). To identify the LO constituents, the obtained retention profile was compared with that of known samples already analyzed by a gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890A) coupled to a mass spectrometer (Agilent 5975C) with similar column and operating conditions (Alizadeh Behbahani &amp; Imani Fooladi,
