<p>Two factors QSSM and LO as the central composition of active edible coatings were designed. For this aim, 2 g of the QSSM was mixed with 1 ml of Tween‐80 and made up to 100 ml with distilled water and heated and agitated using a magnetic stirrer. The LO was added to QSSM solution at levels of 0%, 0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, and 2% v/v. After that, 1 group out of the 5 groups of the samples was coated via being immersed in the QSSM solution for 1 min and the other groups were immersed in the QSSM solutions containing different concentrations of LO for the same period of time. A group that remained uncoated was considered as the control group (Alizadeh Behbahani et al.,
