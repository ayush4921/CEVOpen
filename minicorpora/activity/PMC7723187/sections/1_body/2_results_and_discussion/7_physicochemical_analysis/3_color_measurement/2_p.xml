<p>The results of color evaluation of the ostrich meat samples stored at 4°C during 9 days of storage are presented in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31940-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3a–d</xref>. The results showed that during the storage period, the amount of 
 <italic>L</italic>* or brightness decreased in all treatments, but the slope of the diagram was milder in the coated samples than in the control sample (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31940-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). The results showed that 
 <italic>a</italic>* factor, which measures the redness of the sample, was increased and then decreased in the coated samples. The level of this factor at day 9 of the storage in all samples was significantly different at the level of (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ .05), but the decrease in sample containing 2% LO was lower than in other samples (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31940-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). The results showed that the 
 <italic>b</italic>* value, which is related to the yellowness of the sample, decreased during the storage in the control and QSSM‐coated samples, but in the QSSM + LO samples, it initially increased and thereafter decreased (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ .05). Changes in the sample containing 2% essential oil were lower than in the other samples during the storage time (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31940-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). The results showed that the Δ
 <italic>E</italic> factor, which reflects the overall color change of the sample and is dependent on the 
 <italic>L</italic>*, 
 <italic>a</italic>*, and 
 <italic>b</italic>* factors, increased during the storage time (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31940-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>).
