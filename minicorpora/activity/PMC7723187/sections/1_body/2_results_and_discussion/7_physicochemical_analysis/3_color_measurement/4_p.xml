<p>The researchers also reported that in fresh meat, when cutting any kind of meat, the so‐called meat color flowers and oxygenated myoglobin pigment produce oxymyoglobin; it is brown in color and reduces the sample red color during storage. In the coated samples up to 6 days of the storage, due to the coating and reduction of oxidation process, the amount of oxymyoglobin was higher and this resulted in redness escalation but it decreased after 6 days of storage. The essential oil also reduced the rate of oxidation due to its antioxidant substances and the slope of the redness curve decreased with increasing essential oil content.</p>
