<p>The moisture content of ostrich meat stored at 4°C is shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31940-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>. The results showed that the initial moisture content of the samples was 75%. Over time, the moisture content of all samples decreased, but the rate of moisture content decreased in the coated samples. Also, the results of data analysis of variance showed that all samples had significant differences in the moisture content (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ .05) on day 9. Previous research has shown that water storage capacity has a direct relationship with pH; as pH decreases, water storage capacity decreases. Therefore, one of the reasons for the decrease in the moisture content in the samples is likely to be a decrease in water storage capacity (Botha et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31940-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>). On the other hand, Nisar et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31940-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>) stated that addition of essential oil to edible coating increased the ability to prevent moisture loss. In fact, water binds to the hydrophilic portions of the coating to exit the coating; the addition of the essential oil to the coating increases the hydrophobic part of the coating matrix, thereby preventing further physical barriers to moisture transfer, ultimately reducing its water transmission.
