<p>Comparison between the results of microbial count and sensory (overall acceptability) of the samples showed that there is a good correlation between the data obtained from these tests. For the sample containing 2% essential oil, the shelf life of microbial tests (total microbial load count) and sensory characteristics (overall acceptability) were appropriate until day 9 of storage. For the control sample, microbial load was adequate up to day 3 and overall acceptability was adequate up to day 6.</p>
