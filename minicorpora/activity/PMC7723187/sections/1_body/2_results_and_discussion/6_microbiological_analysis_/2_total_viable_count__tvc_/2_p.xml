<p>The TVC of ostrich meat samples coated with QSSM incorporated with LO (0%, 0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, and 2%) during 9 days of storage at refrigerated temperature is shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31940-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>. The results revealed that the microbial count of all examined groups inclined to increase gradually with storage period. However, the increase in TVC in the samples coated with QSSM + LO was lower than the control sample. With the increase in essential oil, this slope was also decreased. The TVC of the control sample on the 3 days was higher than the standard, indicating that the duration of ostrich meat storage in the refrigerator (4°C) was maximum 3 days. The results showed that the coating of ostrich meat increased the meat shelf life. According to these results, the shelf life of coated ostrich meat containing 2% LO was 6 days at 4°C as compared to the control sample. The pH value of ostrich meat is one of the determinant factors of TVC. The pH of the ostrich meat is near to 6 and is therefore heavily influenced by microbial growth (Van et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31940-bib-0063" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>). Seydim et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31940-bib-0059" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>) reported that addition of rosemary extract and sodium lactate to ostrich meat can reduce TVC. However, the use of a mixture of sodium lactate and rosemary extract provided better antimicrobial results than when they used alone. Therefore, sodium lactate alone or in combination with rosemary extract can be used to reduce microbial growth and increase the shelf life of minced meat when stored in the refrigerator.
