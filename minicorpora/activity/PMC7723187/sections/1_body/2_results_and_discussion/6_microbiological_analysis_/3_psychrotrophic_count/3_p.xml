<p>Bingol and Ergun (
 <xref rid="fsn31940-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>) examined the effect of modified atmosphere containing different amounts of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen on the chemical and microbial properties of ostrich meat. The researchers found that the use of modified atmosphere rather than the use of conventional air conditions reduced the number of bacterial cells during 7‐day storage period. 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> species are highly aerobic and oxygen‐dependent, and oxygen deficiency prevents the growth of these bacteria.
