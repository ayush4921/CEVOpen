<p>The results of statistical analysis showed that the treatments and storage time had a statistically significant effect on psychrotrophic bacterial count in ostrich meat (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ .05). Our results are shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31940-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>. The initial PTC of samples was 3 log colony‐forming unit (CFU)/g and increased in all samples. The highest and the lowest number of psychrotrophic bacterial during the cold storage were observed in the control and the sample coated with QSSM and 2% LO, respectively. The coating of the sample with QSSM and LO had positive effects on preservation of the ostrich meat due to reduction of oxygen exchange. Pseudomonas species are unable to survive in the absence of oxygen because they are extremely aerobic (Alghooneh et al.,
