0: Carpesium cernuum L., one of the two   Carpesium species occurring in Europe, in the Far East and India, found use as a vegetable and a traditional medicinal remedy for several ailments.
1: In the present study, compositions of essential oils distilled from roots and shoots of   C. cernuum plants, cultivated in the open field, have been studied by GC-MS-FID supported by NMR spectroscopy.
2: The analyses led to the identification of 120 compounds in total, of which 115 were found in aerial parts and 37 in roots of the plants.
3: The major constituents found in the oil from shoots were: -pinene (35%) and 2,5-dimethoxy-  p-cymene (thymohydroquinone dimethyl ether, 12%), whereas 2,5-dimethoxy-  p-cymene (55%), thymyl isobutyrate (9%) and thymol methyl ether (8%) predominated in the essential oil obtained from the roots.
4: Antibacterial and cytotoxic activities of the essential oils distilled from   C. cernuum were also tested.
5: The essential oil from aerial parts of the plant demonstrated good inhibitory activity against   Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 and   Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 (MIC: 15.6 L/mL).
