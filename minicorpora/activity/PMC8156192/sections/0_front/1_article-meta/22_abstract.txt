0: Fungal infections remain a major health concern with aromatic plants and their metabolites standing out as promising antifungal agents.
1: The present study aims to assess, for the first time, the antifungal and anti-inflammatory potential of   Bupleurum subsp.
2: paniculatum (Brot.)
3: H.Wolff essential oil from Portugal.
4: The oil obtained by hydrodistillation and characterized by GC-MS, showed high amounts of monoterpene hydrocarbons, namely -pinene (29.036.0%), pinene (26.130.7%) and limonene (10.513.5%).
5: The antifungal potential was assessed, according to CLSI guidelines, against several clinical and collection strains.
6: The essential oil showed a broad fungicidal effect being more potent against   Cryptococcus neoformans and dermatophytes.
7: Moreover, a significant germ tube inhibition was observed in   Candida albicans as well as a disruption of mature biofilms, thus pointing out an effect of the oil against relevant virulent factors.
8: Furthermore, fungal ultrastructural modifications were detected through transmission electron microscopy, highlighting the nefarious effect of the oil.
9: Of relevance, the oil also evidenced anti-inflammatory activity through nitric oxide inhibition in macrophages activated with lipopolysaccharide.
10: In addition, the essential oils bioactive concentrations did not present toxicity towards macrophages.
11: Overall, the present study confirmed the bioactive potential of   B. rigidum subsp.
12: paniculatum essential oil, thus paving the way for the development of effective drugs presenting concomitantly antifungal and anti-inflammatory properties.
