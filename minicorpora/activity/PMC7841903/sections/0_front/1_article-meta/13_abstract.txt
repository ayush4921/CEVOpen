0: BackgroundThe frequent incidence of fungal infection and widespread of antibiotic resistance are emergent concerns in public health.
1: Hence, there is a need to harness the potential of natural bioactive compounds from plant towards treatment of fungal infection.
2: Combination effect of antibiotic creams with natural products from plants is prospective strategy to produce new antifungal agent.
3: This study therefore, revealed antifungal effect of combined Antifungal Creams (AFCs) with Turmeric Essential Oil (TEO) or    Aloe vera Gel (AVG).
4: MethodsPhytochemicals and bioactive compounds in TEO and AVG were revealed using GC-MS. Bioactive compounds in plant extracts were compared to known compounds in database library of National Institute of Standards and Technology (U.S.).
5: Antifungal activity and synergistic effect of AFCs with TEO or AVG were carried out using agar well diffusion method.ResultsPhenol, flavonoids, saponins, alkaloids, steroids, terpenoids and cardiac glycosides were present in TEO and AVG.
6: GCMS revealed thirty-six (36) and eighteen (18) bioactive compounds in TEO and AVG, respectively.
7: AFCs displayed zones of inhibition with values ranged from 5.0 to 14.3 mm, TEO was 5.0 to 11.0 mm and AVG was 8.0 to 11.7 mm against tested fungi.
8: Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) by AFCs, TEO and AVG ranged from 1.25 to 10.0 mg/ml.
9: Combinatory effects of AFCs with TEO or AVG revealed synergistic and indifferent properties.ConclusionDevelopment of novel products using bioactive ingredients from plants with commercially available AFCs will serve as potential alternative therapy to cure dermatological infections with no side effects.
