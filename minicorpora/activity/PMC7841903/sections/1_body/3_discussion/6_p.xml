<p id="Par36">The antagonistic activity of 
 <italic>A. vera</italic> against bacteria, fungi and viruses has been expounded by some studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. The antifungal potential of AVG against tested pathogenic fungi corresponds to the findings of Nidiry et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] who reported antifungal property of bioactive constituents; aloin and aloe-emodin in 
 <italic>A. vera</italic> against 
 <italic>Colletotrichum gloeosporides</italic> and 
 <italic>Cladosporium cucumerinum</italic>. The inhibitory efficiency of AVG corroborates to the findings of Khwakhali and Shrivatava [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] who reported the effectiveness of 
 <italic>A. vera</italic> against pathogenic 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> spp., while Al-Snafi [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] obtained effective treatment (70% growth inhibition) of guinea pig infected with 
 <italic>T. mentagrophytes</italic>. AVG possessed broad antifungal activities against the tested fungi. Findings of Bawankar et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], Saks and Barkai-Golan [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], and Yebpella et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] have reported antifungal activity of AVG against the growth of 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> spp.
 <italic>, Botrytis cineria, Alternaria alternate, Aspergillus</italic> spp
 <italic>.</italic> and 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> at varying concentrations. The antimicrobial potential of 
 <italic>A. vera</italic> could be attributed to anthraquinone and pyrocatechol in the gel of leaves, which are toxic to microorganisms by blocking their ribosomal A site [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. 
 <italic>A. vera</italic> is one of the most important traditional folk and alternative medicine often used for the treatment of infectious diseases with no side effects [
