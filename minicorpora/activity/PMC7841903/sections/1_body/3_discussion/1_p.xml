<p id="Par31">Researchers across the board have responded to continuous increase of multiple antibiotic resistance by pathogenic fungal strains and thus, revealed that novel potential strategy to promote antifungal therapeutic is urgently needed to be explored [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In this study, the combinatory potential of AFCs with TEO or AVG was assessed. Terbinafine was efficient AFC against pathogenic fungi in vitro. Terbinafine is known as a broad spectrum antifungal agent, active against wide range of dermatophytes, moulds, yeasts and dimorphic fungi [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, studies by Karri et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] reported less activity of terbinafine against 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>. Terbinafine was considered to have potency against dermatophytes but now, there is a rise to terbinafine resistance by pathogenic fungi [
