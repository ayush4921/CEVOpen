<p id="Par13">The bioactive compounds in the TEO and AVG were identified with the aid of gas chromatography– mass spectrometry (QP2010 plus Shimadzu, Japan), which was equipped with a split injector and an ion – trap mass spectrometer detector together with a fused – silica capillary column having a thickness of 1.00 μm, dimensions of 20 m × 0.22 mm and temperature limits of 60 °C to 325 °C. The column temperature was programmed between 60 °C and 250 °C at a rate of 0.5 m/s with pressure of 100.2 Kpa. The temperature of the injector and detector were at 250 °C and 200 °C respectively. Helium gas was used as a carrier gas at flow rate of 0.46 m/s. The MS analysis was done based on comparative retention times, mass and peaks of the chemical compounds using the computer-aided matching of unknown mass spectra of compounds with the known compounds stored in the software database library from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Washington, USA, having more than 62,000 patterns as the reference database. The name, molecular weight and the structure of the components of the tested materials were ascertained with database library from the NIST, Washington, USA.</p>
