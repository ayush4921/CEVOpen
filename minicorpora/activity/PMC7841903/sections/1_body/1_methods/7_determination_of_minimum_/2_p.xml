<p id="Par16">The varying concentrations of 1.25, 2.5, 5.0, and 10.0 mg/ml for AFCs, TEO and AVG were prepared and incorporated into a set of sterile tubes. Each test tube was inoculated with 0.1 ml of standardized fungal inoculum and incubated at 26 °C for 48 h. The MIC were recorded as the lowest concentration to prevent growth of macroscopically visible colonies on plates, while there was visible growth on plates without AFCs, TEO and AVG. To determine MIC of combined AFC with TEO or AVG, varying concentrations of 1.0–3.0 mg/ml was used. The synergism, indifference, and antagonism of combined AFC with TEO or AVG were screened on the studied pathogenic fungi. MICs were transformed into Fractional Inhibitory Concentration (FIC) to determine the interaction of two samples in the following manner:</p>
