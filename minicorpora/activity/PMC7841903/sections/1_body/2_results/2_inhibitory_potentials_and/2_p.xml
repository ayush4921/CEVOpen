<p id="Par30">Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref> shows minimum inhibitory concentration of AFCs, TEO and AVG against fungi. AVG displayed lower range of MIC values (1.25 to 5.0 mg/ml), while other were within 1.25 to 10 mg/ml. The MIC obtained for combined AFCs with TEO or AVG was shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>. Combination of clotrimazole + AVG displayed lower MIC value of 1.0 to 2.0 mg/ml against tested fungi. The MICs of fluconazole + AVG, ketoconazole + AVG, and terbinafine + AVG were within 1.0 to 2.5 mg/ml against tested fungi. Table 
 <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref> shows FIC, FIC indices (FICi) as well as their interpretation. Clotrimazole + TEO against 
 <italic>C. albicans,</italic> ketoconazole + TEO against 
 <italic>A. niger,</italic> terbinafine + TEO against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, clotrimazole + AVG against 
 <italic>C. albicans,</italic> fluconazole + TEO against 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> and terbinafine + AVG against 
 <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> (ATCC 66029) displayed synergistic properties. Other combinatory effects of AFC with TEO or AVG were indifferent without antagonism.
