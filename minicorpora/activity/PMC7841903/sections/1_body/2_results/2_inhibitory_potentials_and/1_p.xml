<p id="Par29">The zones of inhibition (mm) reflecting the antifungal efficacy of AFCs, TEO and AVG were reported in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>. AFCs namely; clotrimazole, fluconazole, ketoconazole and terbinafine displayed zones of inhibition against tested fungi with values ranged from 5.0 to 11.6 mm, 5.0 to 11.3 mm, 5.0 to 11.3 mm and 8.0 to 14.3 mm, respectively. TEO have inhibitory zones of 5.0 to 11.0 mm, while AVG have 8.0 to 11.7 mm against tested fungi. Varying zones of inhibition indicated antifungal activity of combined AFCs with TEO or AVG as shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>. Combinatory effect of AFCs with TEO or AVG showed better inhibitory zones against fungi. Ketoconazole + TEO, terbinafine + TEO, fluconazole + AVG and terbinafine + AVG have similar (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) inhibitory effects against 
 <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> (ATCC 66029). Terbinafine + AVG displayed the highest (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) zones of inhibition of 12.7 mm and 13.6 mm against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>Penicillium notatum</italic>, respectively. Zones of inhibition displayed by each AFC combined with AVG against 
 <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> were not significantly different when 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05. Inhibitory action of each AFC combined with TEO against 
 <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> were also similar. Ketoconazole + AVG and terbinafine + AVG respectively have similar inhibitory zones of 12.7 mm and 13.7 mm against 
 <italic>T. mentagrophytes</italic>.
