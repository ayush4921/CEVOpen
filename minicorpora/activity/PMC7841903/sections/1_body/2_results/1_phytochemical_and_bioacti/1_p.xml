<p id="Par28">The quantity of phytochemicals of TEO and AVG was revealed in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Phytochemical such as phenol, flavonoids, saponins, alkaloids, steroids, terpenoids and cardiac glycosides were present in TEO and AVG. while anthraquinones and tannins was present only in AVG. Phenol was present with values of 2.9 mg/ 100 g and 5.1 mg/ 100 g in TEO and AVG, respectively. Alkaloid in TEO and AVG were not significantly different (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.05) with value of 2.3 mg/100 g and 2.1 mg/100 g. Anthraquinones and tannins in AVG was 3.5 mg/100 g and 2.3 mg/100 g, respectively. Cardiac glycoside has the least values of 0.30 mg/100 g in TEO and 0.48 mg/100 g in AVG. Figures 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> show chromatogram of TEO and AVG with peaks for various bioactive constituents. The peaks were shown for 36 and 18 bioactive compounds in TEO and AVG, respectively. Tables 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> show the presence of bioactive compounds in TEO and AVG, respectively identified with GC MS. Z-citral was the major compound in the TEO (14.02%), while Z-9-Tetradecenol (24.99%) was the most abundant compound in AVG. Bioactive compounds such as α -pinene, camphene, linalool, borneol, p-menth-1-en-8-ol, zingiberene, farnesene, farnesol and others were found in TEO (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In AVG, cis oleic acid, dioctyl adipraate, glycerin 1,3-distearate, arachidic acid methyl ester, dipentene diepox, z-9-tetradecenol and others (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).
