<p id="Par38">AFCs, TEO and AVG inhibited the growth of all tested pathogenic fungi with varying degrees of zones of inhibition. Combinatory action of AFCs with TEO or AVG did not slow down their bioactivity against tested fungi. This indicated that bioactive compounds in plant extracts can complement the activity of AFCs to improve their clinical efficacy. The antifungal properties of TEO or AVG combined with different AFCs established their importance in phytomedicine and cosmeceutical. The combination of AFCs with plant extracts will serve as alternative medicine in treating or combating many infectious fungal diseases such as dermatophytosis, which had been a widespread disease. The bioactive ingredients in plant extracts could argument the formulation of body and hair creams (cosmetics) to treat resistant pathogenic fungi within short time with no side effects.</p>
