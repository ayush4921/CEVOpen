0: Medicinal plants are imperious sources of treasurable secondary metabolites and thus, contribute to availability of natural drugs in global markets [ 13].
1: Turmeric;  Curcuma longa belong to ginger family; Zingiberaceae.
2: Turmeric powder from dried ground rhizomes of  C. longa possess culinary uses, act as natural product with analgesic, antibacterial, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and digestive properties.
3: Hence, biological activities of turmeric, its health promoting effects and disease prevention have attracted several applications in pharmaceutical, food and biotechnological industries [ 14].
4: Aloe vera, is another medicinal plant with immense bioactive compounds allied with some pharmacological properties like wound healing, antifungal activity, hypoglycemic or antidiabetic effects, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, immunomodulatory and gastroprotective [ 15].
5: The therapeutic potentials of  A. vera in phytomedicine indicate its several uses in pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries [ 16].
6: Natural products in plants act as reservoirs of novel bioactive compounds and as excellent source of drug discovery with divers biopharmaceutical applications [ 17], hence, biologically active compounds in medicinal plants can be exploited and incorporated in AFCs, which will be a newsworthy option towards new prototype antifungal agents.
7: This study therefore, revealed synergistic antifungal potential of over-the-counter AFCs with TEO or AVG against clinically important pathogenic fungi.
