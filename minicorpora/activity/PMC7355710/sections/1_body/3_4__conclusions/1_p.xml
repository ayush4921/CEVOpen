<p>The biochemical transformations involving oxidation, reduction, and acetylation reactions were apparent in different oil samples obtained from the rosemary herbs that were naturally dried for different amounts of weeks. The presence of various constituents, their ratios in the corresponding oils, and their absence in certain oil batches from different drying slots of herbs, as represented in

 <xref rid="molecules-25-02830-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, supported the contention. The results revealed that the best volatile oil yield by the hydrodistillation procedure of oil extractions with the majority of oil constituents present and comprising the 1,8-cineole, camphor, and camphene ingredients in higher ratios could be obtained after the first week of rosemary herbs’ shade-drying under natural conditions. The one-week dried herbs-based oil contained these three major constituents in 50.9% of the total oil compositions, while the fresh herbs’ oil contained these components of the oil at 55.9%. The same constituents in two and three week dryings-based oils were at 41.4% and 44.8%, respectively. The obtained oil was found to be closest in composition to the fresh herbs-based oil. Hence, we recommend a one-week natural, shade-based drying of the rosemary herbs for higher yields of the volatile oil at both industrial and small scales. Moreover, the antioxidant properties of the one-week dried oil were also at their optimum at higher concentrations of 5 mg/mL of the DPPH-based tests, although two- and three-weeks dried oil showed the best antioxidant values and can also be safely recommended as a traditional way of meat preservation, as has been practiced by several cultures. Though rosemary’s antioxidant activity has been established and is employed in many aliments, it’s claimed CVS, anti-diabetic, anti-inflammation, and anti-cancer bioactivities need independent confirmations.
