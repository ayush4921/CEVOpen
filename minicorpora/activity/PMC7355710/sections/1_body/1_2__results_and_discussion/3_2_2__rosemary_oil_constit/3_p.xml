<p>The observation included major decreases in yields and the number of oil constituents for the oils obtained from the two- and three-weeks naturally dried samples of the herbs, wherein only 19 and 14 components were found in the obtained oil samples, respectively, as compared with the 26 compounds in the one week dried herbs-based oil (

 <xref rid="molecules-25-02830-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The yields of camphene, β-pinene, α-terpineol, bornyl acetate, β-caryophyllene, and 
 <sc>d</sc>-germacrene increased in the two- and three-weeks dried herbs-based volatile oils as compared to the fresh and one-week dried herbs-based oils; however, significant variations were shown only for bornyl acetate, β-caryophyllene, and 
 <sc>d</sc>-germacrene with 
 <italic>p</italic> values of &lt;0.0001, 0.0001, and 0.0263, respectively, compared to fresh herbs-based oil. Moreover, the fresh herb oil analysis indicated the presence of higher concentrations of 1,8-cineole (28.59%), camphor (20.96%), citronellol (3.98%), linalool (3.29%), and verbenone (2.04%), which were common to all dried herbs, but only 1,8-cineole showed significant differences (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0006) between the fresh herbs and other batches. The one-week dried herbs’ oil also contained camphene (7.19%), α-terpinene (2.99%), and p-cymene (1.33%) as the highest concentration constituents in comparison to all other oil batches, although only α-terpinene showed significant differences (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). The borneol, isobornyl formate, and piperitone were only present in the one-week dried herbs-based oil under 0.5% concentrations, providing exclusive fragrance, yield, and maximum components. Again, the presence of myrcene, α- and β-phellandrene, and isobornyl acetate were found only in the fresh and one-week-based oils. Meanwhile, the two- and three-week dried herbs showed different compositions of their respective oils in terms of the foregoing constituents. The majority compounds of the two- and three-weeks dried oils were 1,8-cineole, camphor, bornyl acetate, and β caryophyllene (
