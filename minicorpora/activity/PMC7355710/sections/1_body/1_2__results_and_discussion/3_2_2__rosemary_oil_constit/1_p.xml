<p>None of the major oil constituents, namely eucalyptol (1,8-cineole), camphor, and α-terpineol, were lost in any of the four samples of the herbs, i.e., the fresh herbs of the one-, two-, and three-weeks dried herbs, as observed by gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy (GC–MS) analyses. However, minor constituents’ ratios varied significantly in differently time-dried oil samples (

 <xref rid="molecules-25-02830-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The occurrence of oils’ constituents and their compositional ratios differed among all the oils obtained after different time-periods of drying. However, the compositional ratios of the oils differed less vigorously than the variation in numbers of the oils’ constituents in different batches of oils obtained from differently-timed dried rosemary herbs (

 <italic>RI</italic> 1165), isobornyl formate (
 <italic>RI</italic> 1237), and piperitenone (
 <italic>RI</italic> 1342) were absent in the fresh, two-, and three-weeks dried herbs’-based oils. The one-week dried herb oil was only devoid of terpinolene (
 <italic>RI</italic> 1090), which was 1.12–1.52% (in a statistically insignificant ratio; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.2009) of the oil components in fresh, two, and three-weeks dried herbs’ oils. The fresh herb’s oil contained fewer constituents (23) compared with the oil that was obtained from the one-week dried herbs samples (25 constituents) due to the extraction shortfall and to the presence of excessive water in the fresh herb at the hydrodistillation time. The lowered extractability of the lipophilic constituents of oil in the presence of excess water in the fresh herbs favored the hydrophilic over the hydrophobic oily components, thus leading to lesser oil yields; see

 <xref rid="molecules-25-02830-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The evidence that the oil yield from the fresh and one week dried herbs significantly differed additionally supports the notion. Quantitatively, the oil yields difference in fresh (198 ± 3.45 mg) and two weeks dried herbs (168 ± 5.11 mg) was ~30 mg. In comparison, the three-week drying of the herbs yielded the least oil (97.8 ± 1.27 mg) due to the excessive drying and gradual evaporation of the volatiles from the herbs under the three-weeks of drying, given that all the dryings were performed under similar conditions of temperature, atmospheric pressure, air current availability, and shade throughout the experiment.
