0: The natural drying of   Rosmarinus officinalis Linn.
1: herbs severely affects its volatile oil quality and yields, which is reported here for the first time.
2: The oils obtained through hydrodistillation from fresh, one, two, and three-weeks dried herbs were analyzed by gas chromatographymass spectroscopy (GCMS) and gas chromatographyflame ionization detector (GC-FID), and the yields were 198  3.45, 168.7  5.11, and 97.8  1.27 mg, respectively, as compared to the internal referral standard of 327  5.91 mg yield of the one-week dried herbs oil.
3: Camphor, the major constituent, significantly depleted from 20.96% to 13.84%, while bornyl acetate yields increased from 1.42% to 12.46% (  p values< 0.0001) in three-weeks drying, reflecting the redox processes undergoing within the oil during drying.
4: Several constituents (25) were found in one-week dried herbs oil as compared to the fresh, two-, and three-weeks oils, which consisted of 23, 19, and 14 constituents, respectively, leading to the recommendation of the one-week drying of the herb for maximum oil yield.
5: The DPPH (2, 2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl) reactivity was highest for the two- and three-weeks dried herb-based oils, followed by the one-week dried- and fresh-herb-based oils (  p< 0.0001), again indicating major chemical changes during herbs dryings, affecting the free-radical scavenging capacity of these batches of oils obtained after different drying times.
