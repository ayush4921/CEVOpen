0: Considering CE treatment, in cases where the cysts are small and inactive, compounds and derivatives of benzimidazole are used as the first-choice treatments, while surgery is the preferred treatment for large and active cysts [ 5, 6].
1: The rupture of a cyst or leakage of cyst contents (protoscoleces), which leads to secondary infection or the involvement of nearby organs, is the main concern during hydatid cyst surgery [ 7].
2: To minimize these risks, various chemical protoscolicidal agents such as hypertonic saline (20%), silver nitrate, and formalin are used [ 8].
3: However, recent investigations have reported that these agents are not completely safe and have various adverse side effects including biliary fibrosis, hepatic necrosis, and cirrhosis [ 9].
4: For this reason, finding and discovering new scolicidal drugs with high efficiency and minimal toxicity and side effects is a priority for researchers.
