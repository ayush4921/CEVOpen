<p>There are few studies on the biological and therapeutic activities of 
 <italic>Ferula macrecolea</italic> Boiss.; however, it has been proven that this plant in traditional medicine has various therapeutic properties such as anticonvulsant and antinociceptive effects, being able to remove intestinal parasites, and antihypertensive effects, as well as being able to treat cardiovascular diseases [
