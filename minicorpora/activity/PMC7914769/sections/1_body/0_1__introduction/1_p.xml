<p>Cystic echinococcosis (CE) or hydatidosis is well-known as one of the main important parasitic infections caused by the larval stage of the 
 <italic>Echinococcus granulosus</italic> cestode [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-26-00888" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. With respect to the lifecycle of the parasite, humans, as the intermediate host, are generally infected through the ingestion of food, water, vegetables, etc., contaminated with the parasiteâ€™s eggs excreted from dogs, the definitive host [

 <italic>E. granulosus</italic> in the definitive host is not life-threatening, however, the larval stage of the parasite in the intermediate host (humans and some carnivores such as sheep, goats, etc.) can result in severe conditions, even death, by forming hydatid cysts in various vital organs such as the liver, lung, brain, etc. [
