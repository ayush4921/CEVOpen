<p>Our findings demonstrate the potent protoscolicidal effects of FMEO. FMEO has potent scolicidal efficacy in vitro and ex vivo in an intraperitoneal model of the administration of the drug for CE treatment; however, further studies are required to assess the safety and the efficiency of FMEO as a promising scolicidal agent in a preclinical model (in vivo or in an animal model) and clinical setting, not only through intraperitoneal administration but also through different routes such as the oral route. The findings also show that although the possible protoscolicidal mechanisms of FMEO are not obviously understood, the induction of apoptosis through caspases can be considered as one of the main mechanisms.</p>
