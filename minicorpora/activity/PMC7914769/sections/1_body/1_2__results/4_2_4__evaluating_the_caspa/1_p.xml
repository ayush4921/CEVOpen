<p>In this study, the apoptotic activity of FMEO on 
 <italic>E. granulosus</italic> protoscoleces was determined by the enzymatic activity of caspase-3. To do this, the protoscoleces were exposed to the different concentrations of the FMEO for 2 days, and the percentages of alteration of the activity of the caspase-3 enzyme were evaluated through assessing the concentrations of released NA-
 <italic>p</italic>. Based on the obtained results, FMEO, in a dose-dependent manner and at doses of 75, 150, and 300 ÂµL/mL, induced the activation of the caspase enzyme by 24.3, 35.3, and 48.3%, respectively (
