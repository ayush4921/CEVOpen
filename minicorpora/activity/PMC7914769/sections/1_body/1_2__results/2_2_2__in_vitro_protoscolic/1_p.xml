<p>As exhibited in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00888-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, FMEO at various concentrations had significant protoscolicidal effects in comparison to the control group (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). The best protoscolicidal activity of FMEO was reported at the concentrations of 150 and 300 ÂµL/mL, where 100% of the protoscoleces were destroyed after 30 and 20 min of treatment, respectively. Meanwhile, the rates of viability in the positive and negative control groups were 0 and 96.7% after 10 and 30 min of treatment, respectively (
