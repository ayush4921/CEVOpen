<p>Today, it has been proven that the induction of apoptosis or programmed cell death is reflected as one of the main possible antimicrobial mechanisms of drugs [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-26-00888" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Because caspases are the key mechanisms of apoptosis [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-26-00888" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], we evaluated the caspase-3 activity in the induced apoptosis in 
 <italic>E. granulous</italic> protoscoleces treated with various concentrations of FMEO. We found that after 48 h of the treatment of the protoscoleces, FMEO, in a dose-dependent manner and at doses of 75, 150, and 300 ÂµL/mL, induced the activation of the caspase enzyme by 24.3, 35.3, and 48.3%, respectively. Thus, the induction of apoptosis can be recommended as one of the likely antimicrobial mechanisms of FMEO.
