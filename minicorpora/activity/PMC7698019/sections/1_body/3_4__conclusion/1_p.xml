<p>The presented research provides important information about the non-conventional method for obtaining essential oils, which is ultrasound-assisted hydrodistillation. This technique provides a high yield of obtained essential oil and with respect for pro-environmental aspects. The product obtained has a chemical composition very similar to essential oil extracted by hydrodistillation. The pre-treatment of the seeds by ultrasounds did not result in a loss in their quality. The essential oil from sonicated celery seeds could be a replacement for ‘traditional’ celery seed essential oil and be used in the cosmetics and food industry as a flavoring agent and adjuvant. In the future, it could substitute for synthetic pesticides and food preservatives.</p>
