 <p>The aim of the research was to increase the efficiency of the hydrodistillation process and determine the volatile composition, biological activity, and aroma profile of essential oil from celery seeds (
  <italic>Apium graveolens</italic> L.). The essential oil was extracted from the plant material by ultrasonic hydrodistillation with higher efficiency when compared with classical hydrodistillation. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated using the impedimetric method for the bacteria 
  <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus,</italic> and yeast 
  <italic>Candida vini</italic> as well as moulds 
  <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> and 
  <italic>Penicillium expansum</italic> with minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) (μL/mL) values: 30, 10, 20, 3, 30, 40, and 40, respectively. The oil possessed very weak 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) antioxidant activity with the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
  <sub>50</sub>) value of 81.6 g/L. Initial studies of the aroma profile indicated that the perception of the fragrance of the oil could be related to the sex of the panellists. According to women, the fragrance of celery seeds oil was intense herb-like. From the men’s point of view, it had a fresh, mossy, and mushroom scent.
