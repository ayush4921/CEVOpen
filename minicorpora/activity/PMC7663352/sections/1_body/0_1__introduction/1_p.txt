0: Aromatic plants (APs) have been used since antiquity in folk medicine and as food preservatives due to their many biologically active components including phenolic compounds (e.g., phenolic acids, flavonoids, coumarins, lignans, stilbenes, and tannins), nitrogen-containing compounds (alkaloids, amines, and betalains) and terpenoids (including carotenoids).
1: Essential oils (EOs) are the volatile fractions extracted from aromatic plants.
2: EOs are highly complex natural mixtures of low-molecular mass volatile compounds such as terpenes and aldehydes that are responsible for the typical aroma of any APs [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].
3: EOs are produced by the different parts of plants, including buds, flowers, leaves, stems, twigs, seeds, fruits, roots, wood and bark, and stored in secretory cells, cavities, canals, epidermic cells and glandular trichomes [ 1, 2, 4, 5, 6].
4: Nearby 3000 EOs originated from 2000 plant species and are distributed around 60 botanical genera which are produced worldwide.
5: In nature, EOs play important biological and ecological roles since they are directly involved in plant communication and thus are considered as the language of chemical signaling [ 7].
6: In plant defense, they act as antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal and insecticide agents.
7: Additionally, some EOs may attract certain insects to promote the dispersion of pollens and seeds, or to repel undesirable others [ 3, 7].
8: The term essential oil was used for the first time in the 16th century by Paracelsus von Hohenheim, who referred to the effective component of a drug as Quinta essential [ 8].
9: EOs have widely been used for centuries for their well-known virucidal, antibacterial, antifungal, anticancer, antioxidant, and antidiabetic activities in medicinal and pharmaceutical formulations, in perfumery, fragrance, and cosmetic industries, in aromatherapy and as food additives [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9].
