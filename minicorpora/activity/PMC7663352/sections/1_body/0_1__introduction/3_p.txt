0: Fresh and stored food, such as raw olive, dairy products (cheeses and yogurts), fruits and products (jams, canned fruits, dried fruits, glaced fruits, and fruit salads), bakery products, alcoholic (wine and beer) and non-alcoholic (juice and soft drinks) beverages can undergo microbial contamination [ 13, 14].
1: Food spoilage by microorganisms leads to significant quality deterioration and results in in huge economic losses [ 2].
2: In order to ensure the quality and safety of food products and thus to protect consumer health, effective antimicrobial and antioxidant measures are necessary.
3: Heat treatment, pasteurization, and antiseptic packaging are the most used methods to avoid microbiological deterioration of fruit and vegetable juices and purees and to exclude spoilage as long as the packaging remains intact [ 15].
4: Spoilage is often a consequence of yeast growth in food and beverages leading to turbidity, sedimentation, gassiness and off-flavor [ 16].
5: Saccharomyces cerevisiae is widely found in the industrial fermentation of foods and beverages containing mono- and disaccharides.
6: Common cases of food spoilage by yeast are reported in fresh sea food, packed meat, fresh and frozen vegetables, wines and dairy products.
7: Foods and drinks that cannot be pasteurized are usually treated with preservatives to prevent the growth of mold, yeast and fungi.
8: Primarily used chemical preservatives are weak acids, such as sorbic and benzoic acid, and their salts or sulfites.
9: Recent studies, however, raise concerns about the use of some chemical preservatives such as benzoic acid that can degrade to benzene, a carcinogen substance when used in foods [ 15, 17].
10: Further, to avoid fungal growth on crops, spraying fungicides over the fields is a frequently used practice.
11: However, most of the fungicides as well as their degradation products can contaminate the foodstuff and thus their use is an issue for food safety.
