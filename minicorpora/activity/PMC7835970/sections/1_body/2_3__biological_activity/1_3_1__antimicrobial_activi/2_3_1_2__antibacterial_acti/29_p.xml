<p>The antibacterial activities of the isolated compounds 
 <bold>325</bold>–
 <bold>329</bold> were evaluated against the soil bacterium 
 <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> sp. BD4 (Gram–negative), the environmental strain of 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (Gram–negative), as well as human pathogenic strains of 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (Gram–positive) and 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (Gram–positive). The standard references employed were streptomycin (MIC values: 1.0 µg/mL against 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 10.0 µg/mL against 
 <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> sp. BD4) and gentamicin (MIC values: 1.0 µg/mL against 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 5.0 µg/mL against 
 <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> sp. BD4). Compounds 
 <bold>325</bold>–
 <bold>326</bold> and 
 <bold>328</bold>, demonstrated pronounced activity at 10.0 μg/mL against the soil bacterium 
 <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> sp. BD4 comparable to streptomycin. Compounds 
 <bold>327</bold> and 
 <bold>329</bold> displayed antibacterial efficacies against 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> with the same MIC value of 5.0 µg/mL [
