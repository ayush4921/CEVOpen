<p>Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) assays were used to assess antifungal activity of the compounds against anti-phytopathogenic activity against seven pathogenic fungi 
 <italic>Alternaria alternata</italic> (Aa), 
 <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic> (Bc), 
 <italic>Cochliobolus heterostrophus</italic> (Ch), 
 <italic>Colletotrichum lagenarium</italic> (Cl), 
 <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> (Fo), 
 <italic>Gaeumannomyces graminis</italic> (Gg), and 
 <italic>Thielaviopsis basicola</italic> (Tb). Compound 
 <bold>227</bold> showed potent and specific activity against 4 fungi with MIC values of 32 μg/mL(Bc), 16 μg/mL(Ch), 8 μg/mL(Fo), 8 μg/mL(Tb), respectively, whereas compound 
 <bold>228</bold> showed moderate activity against 3 fungi with MIC values of 16 μg/mL(Bc), 32 μg/mL(Ch), 32 μg/mL(Fo) respectively. Prochloraz, a commercialized broad-156 spectrum fungicide widely used in agriculture, was used as positive antifungal control with MIC values of 8 μg/mL(Bc), 16 μg/mL(Ch), 8 μg/mL(Fo), 8 μg/mL(Tb), respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to show that PIAs exhibit inhibitory activity against plant-pathogenic fungi [
