<p>The anti-inflammatory activities of selected isolated 4 compounds 
 <bold>314</bold>–
 <bold>317</bold> were evaluated as inhibitory activities against lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced nitric oxide (NO) production in RAW264.7 cell lines. Compound 
 <bold>317</bold> showed the most NO inhibitory effects, with the inhibition of 17.4% NO production in LPS stimulated RAW264.7 cells at 10 μM. At the same concentration, compound 
 <bold>315</bold> significantly inhibited the NO production, with 11.2% inhibitory rate. Compound 
 <bold>314</bold> showed weak NO inhibitory effects at 10 μM, with inhibitory rates of 6.5%. At the same concentration, quercetin, the positive control, inhibited NO production to 12.9% [
