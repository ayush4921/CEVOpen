<p>The inhibition of biofilm formation against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> DSM 1104 was tested in 96-well tissue microtiter plates. The compounds were tested in concentrations of up to 256 µg/mL. MeOH and cytochalasin B were used as negative and positive control, respectively. Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) value of 256 µg/mL was observed for metabolite 
 <bold>169</bold> and it showed a weak inhibition of biofilm formation of 20.78% at 256 µg/mL [
