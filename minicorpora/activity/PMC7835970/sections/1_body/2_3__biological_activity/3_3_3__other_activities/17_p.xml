<p>The transformed products

 <bold>225</bold> and the parent compound 
 <bold>L</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00959-f013">Figure 13</xref>) were evaluated for the neuroprotective activity using the LPS-induced neuro-inflammation injury assay. 
 <bold>224</bold>–
 <bold>225</bold> exhibited moderate neuroprotective activity by increasing the viability of U251 cell lines with EC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 35.3 ± 0.9 nM and 32.1 ± 0.9 nM, respectively, while 
 <bold>L</bold> (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 8.3 ± 0.4 nM) exhibited comparable activity with the positive control ibuprofen (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 19.4 ± 0.7 nM). The transformed products 
 <bold>224</bold>–
 <bold>225</bold> and 
 <bold>L</bold> all exhibited considerable neuroprotective activity in the invitro LPS-induced neuro-inflammation injury assay, suggesting that the hupA moiety shared by these compounds may be used as a lead structure for the development of neuroprotective drugs [
