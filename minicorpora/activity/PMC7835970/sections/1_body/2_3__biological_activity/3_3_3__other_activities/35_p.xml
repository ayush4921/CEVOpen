<p>The new compounds 
 <bold>406</bold>–
 <bold>407</bold> were subjected for determination of the xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibitory activity using microtiter plate based NBT assay. Allopurinol was used as a positive control with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.18 ± 0.02 µg/mL. 
 <bold>406</bold> and 
 <bold>407</bold> showed XO inhibitory activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 2.81 ± 0.71 and 0.41 ± 0.1 µg/mL, respectively. The oxidized form of 
 <bold>406</bold> also showed high XO inhibition with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.35 ± 0.13 µg/mL [
