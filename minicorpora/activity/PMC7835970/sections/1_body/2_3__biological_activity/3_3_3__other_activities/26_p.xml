<p>The 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) inhibitory potential of 
 <bold>306</bold>–
 <bold>308</bold> from 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> sp. was assessed in an attempt to explore their activity against 5-LOX. It is noteworthy that 
 <bold>306</bold> displayed prominent 5-LOX inhibitory activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 3.61 μM, compared to that of indomethacin (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.17 μM), while 
 <bold>307</bold> and 
 <bold>308</bold> had moderate activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 7.01 μM and 4.79 μM, respectively [
