 <bold>343</bold> was evaluted for the cytotoxicities against three human tumor cell lines, including a human breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-435), a human gastric cancer cell line (SGC-7901), and a human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cell line (A549) by MTT method. It is notable that penochalasin K
