<p>From 2017â€“2019, a total of 449 new secondary metabolites isolated from plant endophytic fungi using different culture method like common culture, co-culture with bacteria, addition of metal ions and so on, were summarized in this review. These compounds have a variety of unique structures, the difference in structure leads to various biological activities of these compounds. Some of these metabolites display significant antimicrobial effects, cytotoxic activities, antioxidant activities and other biological activities, which indicate that they have potential to be agents to treat some diseases. In this review, structure-activity relationships of some compounds were also reviewed.</p>
