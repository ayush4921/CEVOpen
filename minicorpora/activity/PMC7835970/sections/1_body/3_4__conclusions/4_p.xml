<p>Endophytic fungi isolated from different parts of plants are a huge treasure house on account of the discovery of novel secondary metabolites with biological activities and unique structures. Since the endophyte resources were discovered, more and more researches have been conducted on them. Just from my review article, the new secondary metabolites isolated from plant endophytes during the three years from 2017 to 2019 were counted. Among them, 38 articles were published in 2017, 136 new compounds were obtained; 39 articles were published in 2018, 117 new compounds were obtained; 57 articles were published in 2019, and 196 new compounds were obtained. It can be discovered that in the past three years, the research trend of plant endophytes and their metabolites have increased year by year. The more new compounds obtained, the greater the possibility of screening compounds with excellent biological activity. This is also an important significance for researchers to study plant endophytes. Through this review, i hope to arouse more peopleâ€™s interest and attention in this field and screen out compounds with good biological activities to create a better life for mankind by utilizing endophytes resources.</p>
