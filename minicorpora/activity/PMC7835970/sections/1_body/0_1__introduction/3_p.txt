0: In this review, 449 new secondary metabolites, together with their chemical structures and biological activities were summarized.
1: The structure-activity relationships and absolute configureuration of some compounds have also been described.
2: Among all new compounds, terpenoids account for the largest proportion (75%), followed by polyketones (36%).
3: The proportion of different types of compounds in all new compounds is shown in  Figure 1.
4: These new compounds were isolated from various fungi associated with different tissues from different plants.
5: As a result, their structures varied a lot, which leads to their multitudinous biological activities.
6: In addition to common antimicrobial activity and anti-tumor activity, some compounds also showed anti-enzyme activity and inhibition of biofilm formation, inhibition of phytoplankton growth, and so on.
