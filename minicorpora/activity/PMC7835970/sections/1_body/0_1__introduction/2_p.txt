0: The multiformity of endophytes enable they can produce a variety of secondary metabolites.
1: In recent years, the metabolites isolated from the endophytic fungi include alkaloids, steroids, terpenes, anthraquinones, cyclic peptides, flavonoids commonly [ 5].
2: Some secondary metabolites exhibit high biological activities.
3: The antitumor, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, antifungal and other compounds have been produced by different endophytic fungi.
4: Therefore, the chemical variety of secondary metabolites produced by endophytic fungi has advantage for new drug development [ 8].
