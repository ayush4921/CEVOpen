0: Secondary metabolites isolated from plant endophytic fungi have been getting more and more attention.
1: Some secondary metabolites exhibit high biological activities, hence, they have potential to be used for promising lead compounds in drug discovery.
2: In this review, a total of 134 journal articles (from 2017 to 2019) were reviewed and the chemical structures of 449 new metabolites, including polyketides, terpenoids, steroids and so on, were summarized.
3: Besides, various biological activities and structure-activity relationship of some compounds were aslo described.
