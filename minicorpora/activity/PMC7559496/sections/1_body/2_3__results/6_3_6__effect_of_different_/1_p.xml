<p>We found that each intervention group significantly reduced the MMP-2 content in comparison with the MG (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(a)</xref>, the content of MMP-2 in HOO groups was obviously decreased in contrast with that in HOJ (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Groups with bergamot essential oil could significantly decrease MMP-2 level compared with the corresponding dose of juice groups (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(b)</xref>, the content of MMP-9 in the essential oil groups could be reduced to about half of that in the MG. Groups with essential oil could significantly reduce MMP-9 level in contrast with the corresponding dose of juice groups (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Both of bergamot and sweet orange groups had attenuating effects on MMP level with a dose-effect relationship.
