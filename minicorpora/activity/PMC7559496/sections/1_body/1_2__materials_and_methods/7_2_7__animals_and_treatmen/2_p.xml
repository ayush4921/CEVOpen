<p>At the end of the experiment, the golden hamster was fasted for 12 h (free drinking water) and then deeply comatose with diethyl ether. After taking blood from the eyelids with a capillary tube, hamsters were sacrificed. Blood was stored at 4°C for 4 h and then centrifuged at 4000 g for 10 min in a refrigerated centrifuge. Finally, the supernatant was collected and stored at -80°C for further detection. At the same time, the golden hamsters were dissected and the spleen, testis, and sebaceous gland were taken to weigh them. Part of the sebaceous gland was precooled in liquid nitrogen and then stored in an ultra-low-temperature refrigerator for later detection of related indicators. All experiment procedures in our study involving animals were allowed by the Ethics Committee of the Beijing Key Laboratory of Functional Food from Plant Resources and carried out in accordance with the guidelines for the use and care of laboratory animals of the National Institutes of Health.</p>
