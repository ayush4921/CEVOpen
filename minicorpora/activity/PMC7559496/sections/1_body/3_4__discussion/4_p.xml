<p>Inflammation is an initial host immune reaction which is mediated by inflammatory factors [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The induction of inflammation mediators is associated with 
 <italic>P. acnes</italic> [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. 
 <italic>P. acnes</italic> and associated cellular membrane lipopolysaccharides could induce the expression of IL-8, TNF, and IL-1
 <italic>α</italic> in cultured sebocytes [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The underlying mechanisms are that sebocytes can be recognized and activated by 
 <italic>P. acnes</italic>, which further trigger the release of inflammatory cytokines [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> is an extensively studied cytokine associated with many inflammatory diseases [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Evidences indicated that IL-1
 <italic>α</italic> is one of the main inflammatory factors, which could induce the proliferation of keratinocytes and sebaceous gland cells and eventually promote the formation of acne vulgaris [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Moreover, increased IL-1 contents could further promote the expression of MMPs and lipid synthesis [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. MMPs have been suggested to be involved in acne vulgaris, and different levels of MMP expression could contribute to the development of different types of acne lesions [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>–
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Keratinocytes are an important source of MMPs in acne vulgaris, and 
 <italic>P. acnes</italic> can induce the expression of several kinds of MMPs, including MMP-2 and MMP-9 [
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Kim et al. reported that 
 <italic>Citrus obovoides</italic> and 
 <italic>Citrus natsudaidai</italic> essential oils could reduce 
 <italic>P. acnes</italic>-induced secretion of IL-8 and TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> [
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In one study, a 
 <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>-fermented 
 <italic>Chamaecyparis obtusa</italic> leaf extract was reported to have a great effect on inflammatory markers, such as IL-8, IL-1, and NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Also, previous studies reported that essential oil and juice could alleviate acne vulgaris based on their antibacterial effect [
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In our study, results showed that bergamot essential oil, bergamot juice, sweet orange essential oil, and sweet orange juice could reduce the levels of IL-6, TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>, MMP-2, MMP-9, and especially IL-1
 <italic>α</italic>, indicating that bergamot essential oil, bergamot juice, sweet orange essential oil, and sweet orange juice could improve acne vulgaris through alleviating inflammatory response and suppressing 
 <italic>P. acnes</italic> in golden hamsters (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> and
