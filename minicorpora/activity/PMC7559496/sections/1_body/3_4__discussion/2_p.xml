<p>The secretion of androgen plays an important role in the occurrence and development of acne lesions [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Excessive androgen secretion or imbalance of androgen and estrogen levels can lead to sebaceous gland hyperplasia, excessive sebum secretion, and abnormal keratinization of the hair follicle sebaceous gland, resulting in the development and continuous occurrence of acne vulgaris [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. High-dose estrogen exerted a negative feedback on the gonadal axis, which could result in the reduction of sebum formation [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Evidence showed that higher content of free T with lower level of E
 <sub>2</sub> was significantly in favor of severe acne vulgaris [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Thus, balancing the ratio between androgens and estrogens could help alleviate or treat acne vulgaris. In our study, the bergamot essential oil significantly reduced the serum T content in golden hamsters, while HOO and HOJ groups markedly increased the serum E
 <sub>2</sub> level (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(a)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(b)</xref>). This indicated that sweet orange essential oil and bergamot essential oil could improve acne lesions via directly reducing the androgen level or decreasing the androgen/estrogen ratio (
