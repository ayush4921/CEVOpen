<p>Acne vulgaris is a prevalent dermatologic disease, mainly distributed in the pilosebaceous units including the face, neck, chest, back, and shoulders. The clinical manifestations of acne vulgaris are mainly seborrheic, noninflammatory skin lesions, inflammatory lesions, and varying degrees of scarring [

According to recent dermatologic guidelines, the current treatments for acne vulgaris are divided into conventional pharmacological and nonpharmacological therapies. The former therapies include antibiotics, retinoids, hormonal agents, and benzoyl peroxide while laser and light-based therapies, chemical peels, micro-needling, (micro) dermabrasion, and (mechanical) lesion removal are the latter therapies most commonly applied [

 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Nevertheless, none of these therapies is free of side effect [
