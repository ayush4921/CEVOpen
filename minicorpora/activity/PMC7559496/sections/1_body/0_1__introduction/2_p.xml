<p>Bergamot (
 <italic>Citrus medica</italic> L. var. 
 <italic>sarcodactylis</italic>) has been applied as a medicinal plant just because of its stomachic, antifungal, and bacteriostatic properties [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Bergamot, also called finger citron, is one of the species of 
 <italic>Citrus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The carpels of finger citron split, causing a finger-like fruit shape [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The flowers, leaves, and fruits of bergamot can be used as medicine, which play roles in soothing the liver and relieving depression [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Bergamot peel is mostly used to distill bergamot essential oil (BEO) while bergamot juice (BJ) is obtained by squeezing the endocarp of the fruits [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Evidences indicated that BEO could show some properties like anti-inflammation, immunomodulatory, and wound healing [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The flavonoid-rich fraction of BJ could also exhibit anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Sweet orange (
 <italic>Citrus sinensis</italic> (L.) Osbeck) is another member of the 
 <italic>Citrus</italic> genus fruit which becomes more and more popular in recent years. According to the previous research, sweet orange was widely consumed as fresh fruit and juice, while the peel was also rich in essential oils [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Sweet orange juice is one of the natural sources of large amounts of vitamin C, flavonoids, and other bioactive compounds with potential effects on the inflammatory response [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Sweet orange essential oil is one of the important natural plant essential oils, with an attractive orange flavor, which was reported to have stress-relief, antifungal, anticarcinogenic, and radical-scavenging properties [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Moreover, formulations based on orange and sweet basil oils were effective in treating acne vulgaris [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Based on the potential physiological activities of bergamot and sweet orange, it is interesting to figure out whether they could show effects on alleviating acne vulgaris. Is it the juice or essential oil that plays roles in improving acne vulgaris? What is the difference between bergamot and sweet orange in ameliorating acne vulgaris?
