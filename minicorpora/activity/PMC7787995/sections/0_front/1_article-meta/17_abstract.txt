0: Echinops kebericho Mesfin is used for the management of various diseases and fumigation during child birth.
1: This study investigated acute and repeated-dose toxicity of   E. kebericho M. essential oils (EOs).
2: The study was conducted in Swiss albino mice.
3: Organ weight, histopathology and clinical chemistry were analyzed.
4: The dose and duration of treatment were defined in accordance with Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guideline.
5: No mortality was observed in acute oral dose toxicity study up to 2000 mg/kg per body weight.
6: Compared to control group, treated groups did not show significant abnormalities in body weight and most parameters of clinical chemistry parameters and relative organ weight in repeated-dose toxicity study.
7: However, urea, albumin, aspartate aminotransferase, and relative organ weight of right kidney showed variations in treated groups compared to control group.
8: All treated groups and control group showed normal histology except lymphocytic infiltrates observed on the kidney with 200 mg/kg treated female group.
9: The current study revealed that EO of   E. kebericho M. could be considered well tolerated in acute and repeated-dose exposure.
10: Further, teratogenic, mutagenic, carcinogenic, and sub-chronic and chronic toxicity studies are warranted.
