 <xref rid="bib0260" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In the current study, the EO largely displayed similar toxicity profile to most EOs from other plant EOs. Turmeric EO oral administration up to the dose of 5 g/kg body weight is safe to rats [
 <xref rid="bib0265" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Thymus vulgaris L EO was well tolerated up to the dose of 2000 mg/kg in acute exposure, and the 28-day sub-acute toxicity study revealed that the no-observed-adverse effect level (NOAEL) was greater than 250 mg/kg/day [
 <xref rid="bib0270" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. 
 <italic>Citrus aurantifolia</italic> posed mild hematotoxic, nephrotoxic and hepatotoxic effects in doses of 100 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg in 60-day repeated dose study [
 <xref rid="bib0205" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Mild toxicity observed in the latter case could be attributed to longer treatment; 28 days versus 60 days. Long term exposure to moderate concentrations of mixtures of terpenes could cause possible adverse health effect [
 <xref rid="bib0275" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Ursolic acid a pentacyclic triterpenoid which can be isolated from different plant EO did not cause significant toxicity [
 <xref rid="bib0280" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The biological effects (either therapeutic or toxic) of EOs could be because of the pro-oxidant effect in cells [
 <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and display more or less similar effect because of their structural similarity [
