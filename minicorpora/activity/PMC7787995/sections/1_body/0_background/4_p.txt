0: Previous toxicity studies established relative safety of the EOs  in vitro model [ 19] and decoction in rats [ 29].
1: Extrapolation of  in vitro toxicity to human is less reliable and there is a need for animal model toxicity study.
2: Given the numerous studies confirming the medicinal use and wide traditional use of  E. kebericho as inhalation, characterization of its EO toxicity profile is required in order to protect and promote public health.
3: Hence, this is the continuation of our previous study [ 29] to establish the acute and repeated-dose toxicities of  E. kebericho EOs.
4: The study predicted the safety of the EO in human use, ensure the public safety, and promote further development.
