<p id="par0170">This study provided comprehensive evidence on the safety of 
 <italic>E. kebericho</italic> EO and confirmed the relative safety in acute and repeated-dose conditions. No significant morbidity or mortality was observed up to 2000 mg/kg. The repeated-dose toxicity study demonstrated no observable behavioral adverse effect or damages on gross anatomy. Histological changes did not occur in the liver and spleen. The indifferent finding of AST and histopathology at highest dose and the observation of some level of renal adverse effect at low dose but not higher or lower dose warrants further investigation in larger sample sizes. In general, EO of 
 <italic>E. kebericho</italic> M. could be considered well tolerated in acute and repeated-dose exposure. Further, teratogenic, mutagenic, carcinogenic, and sub-chronic and chronic toxicity studies are warranted.
