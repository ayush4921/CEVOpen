0: Medicinal plants and their derived compounds have drawn the attention of researchers due to their considerable impact on human health.
1: Among medicinal plants, mint (  Mentha species) exhibits multiple health beneficial properties, such as prevention from cancer development and anti-obesity, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, and cardioprotective effects, as a result of its antioxidant potential, combined with low toxicity and high efficacy.
2: Mentha species are widely used in savory dishes, food, beverages, and confectionary products.
3: Phytochemicals derived from mint also showed anticancer activity against different types of human cancers such as cervix, lung, breast and many others.
4: Mint essential oils show a great cytotoxicity potential, by modulating MAPK and PI3k/Akt pathways; they also induce apoptosis, suppress invasion and migration potential of cancer cells lines along with cell cycle arrest, upregulation of Bax and p53 genes, modulation of TNF, IL-6, IFN-, IL-8, and induction of senescence phenotype.
5: Essential oils from mint have also been found to exert antibacterial activities against   Bacillus subtilis,   Streptococcus aureus,   Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and many others.
6: The current review highlights the antimicrobial role of mint-derived compounds and essential oils with a special emphasis on anticancer activities, clinical data and adverse effects displayed by such versatile plants.
