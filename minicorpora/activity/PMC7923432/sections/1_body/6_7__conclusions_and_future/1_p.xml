 <italic>Mentha</italic> species have been used in indigenous medicine for many centuries and this review attempts to provide an overview on 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> species’ preventive and curative effects. The essential oils derived from 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> species acts as a good expectorant and further have been used as a folk remedy for respiratory diseases such as bronchitis, sinusitis, tuberculosis and the common cold. 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> species’ exploitation in pharmaceuticals formulations requires further research. Likewise, clinical trials are scarce and intense efforts should be made to confirm the claims of efficacy in humans. However, numerous preclinical works have been performed, underlining the antioxidant, antibacterial, antifungal, anti-yeast, antiviral, and anticancer activity. Indeed, 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> species, and especially essential oils, are used to reduce microbial load, suggesting a strong bactericidal, virucidal, and fungicidal activity. Nevertheless, some adverse effects, such as allergic reactions, vomiting, headache, flushing, heartburn and nausea hepatotoxicity, apnea and larygospasm, neuronal cell damage, may arise due to the presence of some compounds (carvone, limonene, menthol, pulegone) also depending on the 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> extract concentration applied. Moreover, the presence of harmful compounds in plant such as pulegone and menthone can be reduced by oven-drying or cooked before consumption in order to make it safer. In addition, care should be taken when this plant is consumed along with drugs which induce P450 enzymes.
