<p>The Labiatae family includes some of the most acknowledged and famous medicinal plants, since numerous studies have reported the cytotoxicity effect of 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> species. For example, Rahimifard et al. [
 <xref rid="B150-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>] studied the cytotoxicity effects extracts and essential oils of five 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> species on HeLa (human malignant cervix carcinoma), Hep2 (human laryngeal carcinoma), and Vero (green African monkey kidney) cell lines. They found that EOs showed greater cytotoxicity potential than the extracts and were more toxic in Hela cell line (IC
 <sub>50</sub> ≤ 42.3 μg/mL), while the extracts were more toxic against Vero cell line (IC
 <sub>50</sub> ≥ 94.3 μg/mL). Hep2 cells showed less sensitivity than the other two cell lines [
 <xref rid="B150-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>]. Differently, aqueous extract of 
 <italic>M. spicata</italic> showed cytotoxicity effect on U937 leukemia cells (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 4.8 mg/mL) [
 <xref rid="B151-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>]. The methanolic extract of 
 <italic>M. longifolia</italic> at a concentration &gt;0.5 µg/µl demonstrated antiproliferative effects in adrenocortical tumor cell lines, with modulating activity on MAPK and PI3k/Akt pathways [
 <xref rid="B152-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>]. Ohara and Matsuhisa screened 120 medicinal plants for antitumor effects against the okadaic aid (OA) tumor inducer and noted that 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> species were among the most effective in antiproliferative activity (86–100%) [
 <xref rid="B153-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>]. According to Hussain and co-workers, hydrodistilled EOs from four commonly cultivated 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> species such as 
 <italic>M. longifolia</italic>, 
 <italic>M. spicata</italic>, 
 <italic>M. arvensis</italic>, and 
 <italic>M. piperita</italic> exhibited good cytotoxicity against the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 [
 <xref rid="B123-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]. Another work screened various species of 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> plant extracts for antitumor activities and found that aqueous extract of 
 <italic>M. pulegium</italic> showed the best antitumor activity (94%), whereas 
 <italic>M. longifolia</italic> extracts exhibited reasonable antitumor activity [
 <xref rid="B154-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>]. Similarly, methanolic extract of 
 <italic>M. longifolia</italic> at a dose of 500 μg/mL resulted in 25% cell death and this cytotoxic effect was dose-dependent, that is, further increase of the extract doses up to 1000, 1500, and 2000 μg/mL produced 25, 50, and 62.5% deaths, respectively [
 <xref rid="B155-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>]. In a recent study, Al-Ali et al. reported that water and methanolic extracts of 
 <italic>M. longifolia</italic> had significant antimutagenic and anticancer activities as depicted by brine shrimp bioassay and Ames mutagenicity bioassay [
 <xref rid="B156-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>]. Furthermore, it was showed that the methanolic extract of 
 <italic>M. pulegium</italic> had no cytotoxic effects, but its essential oil proved to be a potent cytotoxic agent on SKOV-3, HeLa and A549 cell lines [
 <xref rid="B157-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>]. Jain et al. showed that chloroform and ethyl acetate extracts of 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> leaves have significant cytotoxicity in time- and dose-dependent manner on HeLa, MCF-7, Jurkat, T24, HT-29, MIAPaCa-2 cell lines; these extracts also induced G1 cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, upregulation of 
 <italic>Bax</italic> and 
 <italic>p53</italic> genes, some cytokines including TNF, IL-6, IFN-γ, IL-8, and induction of senescence phenotype in treated cells [
 <xref rid="B158-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>]. Silver nanoparticles containing the aqueous extract of 
 <italic>M. pulegium</italic> showed significant cytotoxicity on MCF-7 [
 <xref rid="B159-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>] and triggered caspase 9-dependent cell death in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells [
 <xref rid="B160-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>]. 
 <sc>l</sc>-Menthol, one of the main components of 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> species, has multiple applications in traditional medicine. Faridi et al. observed that it modulated tubulin polymerization, induced apoptosis and also suppresses the expression of HSP90 [
 <xref rid="B161-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>]. In their proposed model, the latter authors suggested that 
 <sc>l</sc>-menthol provoked apoptosis directly via caspase 10 activation and also activated caspase 9 which indirectly triggered caspase 3 and mitochondrial cell death [
 <xref rid="B161-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>]. Perillyl alcohol is a monoterpene isolated from lavendin, peppermint, spearmint and some other plants [
 <xref rid="B162-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>], and several studies showed that this compound could inhibit tumor progression. Reddy et al. reported that perillyl alcohol at 1 g/kg level led to apoptosis induction and significantly inhibited the incidence and multiplicity of the adenocarcinoma of the colon in treated rats [
 <xref rid="B163-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>]. Further studies showed that perillyl alcohol induces G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in Bcr/Abl transformed myeloid cells through inhibition of Ras signaling pathway [
 <xref rid="B164-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">164</xref>,
 <xref rid="B165-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">165</xref>], or induction of Bak protein in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells involved in mitochondrial cell death pathway [
 <xref rid="B166-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">166</xref>]. Perillyl alcohol also delayed and inhibited tumor formation in non-melanoma model of mouse skin carcinogenesis and inhibited UV-B-induced AP-1 transactivation in cultured human keratinocytes and transgenic mice that expressed a luciferase reporter regulated by AP-1 response element [
 <xref rid="B167-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">167</xref>]. 
 <italic>M. piperita</italic> extract showed a neuro-protective effect in gamma-irradiated mice [
 <xref rid="B168-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">168</xref>], and the oral administration of its water extract in papilloma tumors mice (initiated by 7,12-dimethyl benz(a)anthracene, DMBA) reduced the incidence of tumors by 64% and increased the latency period of the appearance of papilloma [
 <xref rid="B169-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">169</xref>]. 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-NQO) is a quinoline derivative that has tumorigenic potential through induction of DNA lesions and chromosome damages [
 <xref rid="B170-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">170</xref>]. It was reported that the chloroform, the hexane, and the ethyl acetate fractions of 
 <italic>M. spicata</italic> reduced the frequency of micro-nucleated polychromatic erythrocytes in mouse bone-marrow induced by 4-NQO, and moreover, treatment of mice with these fractions resulted in a significant decrease in apoptotic cells. Among the latter fractions, the ethyl acetate showed the highest effectiveness against 4-NQO [
 <xref rid="B171-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">171</xref>]. Ifosfamide is a chemotherapy drug and an immunosuppressive agent that is used to treat many different types of cancers including testicular cancer, bladder cancer, small cell lung cancer, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer and osteosarcoma [
 <xref rid="B59-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,
 <xref rid="B172-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">172</xref>]. The exact mechanism of ifosfamide action has not been determined yet, but it reportedly binds to the N-7 position of guanine and results in inter- and intra-strand cross-links in the DNA and cell death [
 <xref rid="B173-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">173</xref>]. 
 <italic>M. spicata</italic> extract at dose 400 mg/kg showed strong anti-mutagenic effect against clastogenic action of ifosfamide in bone marrow cells and sperm abnormalities [
 <xref rid="B174-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">174</xref>]. Ethanol extract of 
 <italic>M. arvensis</italic> showed the highest anti-angiogenic effects in the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay, followed by methanol and ethyl acetate extracts. Treatment of CAMs with 500 μg of the ethanol extract at 96 h resulted in completely suppression of angiogenesis [
 <xref rid="B175-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">175</xref>,
 <xref rid="B176-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">176</xref>]. 
 <italic>M. aquatica</italic> essential oil revealed suppressor activity against skin carcinogenesis by suppression of keratin 14 and COX-2 overexpression in 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene/12-
 <italic>O</italic>-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (DMBA/TPA)- induced two-stage carcinogenesis mouse models [
 <xref rid="B177-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">177</xref>]. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a group of Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>- and Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> -dependent endopeptidases that participate in extracellular matrix remodeling and degradation [
 <xref rid="B178-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">178</xref>]. They have key roles in numerous basic and fundamental physiological processes including tissue remodeling, angiogenesis, wound healing, and migration and also have significant role in several pathological conditions including cancer progression and invasion [
 <xref rid="B179-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">179</xref>]. 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> species exhibited modulatory effects on the expression or activity of some MMPs, and Liu et al. reported that 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg of spearmint oil significantly decreased the expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, and MMP-9 in rat lung tissues [
 <xref rid="B180-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">180</xref>]. Moreover, treatment of Wehi-164 fibrosarcoma cells with aqueous extract of spearmint led to significant reduction in MMP-2/MMP-9 activity in a dose-dependent manner, as there was no detectable activity of MMP-2/MMP-9 in Wehi-164 cells treated with 10 mg/mL of the extract after 24, 48, and 72 h [
 <xref rid="B151-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>]. A phytomics analysis (analysis of primary and secondary metabolites of plant extracts) showed that 500 µg/mL of 
 <italic>M. piperita</italic> extract had significant inhibitory effect on the activity of MMP-1 (84.4%), MMP-8 (80.46%), MMP-13 (91.02%) [
 <xref rid="B181-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">181</xref>]. Wound-closure assay demonstrated that treatment of HT-29 cells with concentration of 500 μg/mL of spearmint phenolic extract produced a blockade of invasion potential of HT-29 cells, though gelatin zymography experiments showed that the activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 was not significantly inhibited. Also, spearmint extract led to reduced expression of iNOS (inducible nitric oxide synthase) in the 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced chronic inflammation rat models [
 <xref rid="B182-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">182</xref>]. Heat-induced expression of MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-10, MMP-12, and MMP-13 in human dermal fibroblast was significantly inhibited by 100 μg/mL of apple mint leaves extract (ALE). Also, the activity of p-ERK, p-JNK, p-p38, and the expression of IL-8 were inhibited in a dose-dependent manner in HDF cells treated with ALE [
