<p>Fungal diseases are a severe health issue especially in subtropical and tropical regions of the world [
 <xref rid="B120-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. Due to microbial resistance against common antifungal drugs, there is an urgent need for discovery and development of novel plant-based natural antifungal agents [
 <xref rid="B121-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. Besides antibacterial activity, 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> species have also been investigated as a potential source of antifungal agents to control pathogenic molds [
 <xref rid="B92-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. Antifungal activity of 
 <italic>M. spicata</italic> was studied by Nosrati et al. and it was found that the EO significantly restricted the mycelia growth of 
 <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> sp. in a dose-dependent manner [
 <xref rid="B122-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. The antifungal potential of EO of four 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> species, including 
 <italic>M. arvensis</italic>, 
 <italic>M. piperita</italic>, 
 <italic>M. longifolia</italic>, and 
 <italic>M. spicata</italic>, was evaluated by Hussain et al. [
 <xref rid="B65-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. The results of the latter research from the disc diffusion assay followed by MIC revealed that 
 <italic>M. arvensis</italic> exhibited maximum antimicrobial activity with larger IZ (14–33 and 16–30 mm) and smallest MIC values (20.0–330.3 and 56.2–139.0 μg/mL) against selected strains of bacteria and fungi, respectively. 
 <italic>Mentha piperita, M. longifolia,</italic> and 
 <italic>M. spicata</italic> also exhibited a remarkable antimicrobial potential with IZ 15–20, 16–31, and 12–29 mm and 11–32, 19–30, and 16–29 mm against selected strains of bacteria and fungi, respectively. In another report, 
 <italic>M. spicata</italic> EO was shown to be a good natural antifungal agent against pathogenic molds such as 
 <italic>Mucor mucedo</italic>, 
 <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic>, 
 <italic>Fusarium solani</italic>, 
 <italic>Botryodiplodiatheobromae</italic>, and 
 <italic>Rhizopus solani</italic> [
 <xref rid="B123-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]. Furthermore, recent report on the antifungal activity of chitosan in both its natural and nanoparticle forms revealed that incorporation of mint extract into chitosan nanoparticles resulted in increased antifungal effects against mycelium growth of 
 <italic>A. niger</italic> [
 <xref rid="B124-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. The latter finding supports the potential uses of 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> extracts and oils as antifungal agents in nanocapsulation of different food bioactives such as biopeptides. Moreover, the extract from 
 <italic>M. longifolia</italic> (5 μL/mL) showed an effective fungicidal potential against 
 <italic>Aspergillus, Fusarium, Penicillium funiculosum</italic>, and 
 <italic>Trichoderma viride</italic> [
 <xref rid="B89-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. The most sensitive strains were 
 <italic>Cladosporium fulvum, Penicillium ochrochloron</italic>, and 
 <italic>Cladosporium cladosporioides</italic> where a concentration of as small as 2.5 μL/mL was found to be lethal [
 <xref rid="B89-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Similarly, Moghtader evaluated the antifungal activity of MPEO against 
 <italic>A. niger</italic> and reported that the oil possessed stronger antifungal activity than standard antibiotic, gentamycin [
 <xref rid="B125-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. The antifungal activity of 
 <italic>M. piperita</italic> oil can be mainly ascribed to high content of oxygenated monoterpenoids, such as menthone and menthol. The broad-spectrum antifungal activity of 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> EOs can be linked to the presence of major chemical constituents such as menthone, menthol, piperitenone oxide, and carvone [
 <xref rid="B89-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>].
