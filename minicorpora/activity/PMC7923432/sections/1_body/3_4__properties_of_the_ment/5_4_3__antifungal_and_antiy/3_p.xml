 <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> has been frequently used as a model organism to study the anti-yeast activities and investigate the mode of actions of different compounds [

 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cells with MPEO caused the increase of intracellular ROS species, mtDNA damages, mitochondrial fragmentations, formation of petite mutants because of loss of respiratory chain function and chromatin condensation (with no effect on plasma membrane) [
