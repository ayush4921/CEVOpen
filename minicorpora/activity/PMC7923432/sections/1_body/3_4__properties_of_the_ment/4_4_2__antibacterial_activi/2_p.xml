<p>Several studies showed that essential oils exerted their antibacterial effects via disrupting the structure of membranes, resulting in loss of integrity and increased cell permeabilization [

 <xref rid="B105-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. The hydroxyl group in phenol compounds was supposed to have a significant role in the antimicrobial activity of essential oils [

 <xref rid="B107-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]; treatment of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> cells by phenolic compounds caused surface blebbing and inhibition of RNA and protein synthesis [
 <xref rid="B108-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. Over the last years, the antimicrobial, antifungal, antiyeast and antiparasitic activities of essential oils and extracts of 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> species have been studied. Stanisavljević et al. prepared the essential oils from 
 <italic>M. longifolia</italic> using three different methods including the natural way, in the laboratory oven (45 °C) and in the absorptional low-temperature condensational drier (35 °C). They showed that the essential oils obtained by the last method had the strongest antimicrobial and antifungal effects, while the essential oils prepared in natural way showed the strongest antioxidant activities [

 <italic>M. longifolia</italic> exhibited significant antibacterial effects on gram-negative bacteria including 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>S. enterica</italic> [
 <xref rid="B90-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. In another study, Gulluce et al. showed that the volatile oils of 
 <italic>M. longfolia ssp. longfolia</italic> revealed strong antimicrobial activities against 15 bacteria, 14 fungi and four yeast species [

 <xref rid="B111-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>] showed that menthol, one of the main components of 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> species essential oils, inhibited the H
 <sup>+</sup>-ATPase pump and intracellular acidification in 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells. They also reported that menthol inhibited ergosterol biosynthesis pathway and influenced the membrane fluidity and integrity, thus leading to leakage of the intracellular contents [
 <xref rid="B111-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. The volatile oil of 
 <italic>M. spicata</italic> showed remarkable antibacterial activity on different 
 <italic>Xanthomonas</italic> strains, and also showed mycelium growth inhibition effect on 
 <italic>A. solani</italic>, 
 <italic>R.solani</italic>, 
 <italic>V. dahlia</italic> and FORL (
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> f.
