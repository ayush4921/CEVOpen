<p>It was reported that ethanol extract of 
 <italic>M. arvensis</italic> induced the generation of ROS in 
 <italic>A. baumannii</italic> cells in a dose-dependent manner, triggering cell membrane damage and protein leakage from the treated cells in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner [
 <xref rid="B113-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. Moreover, structural equation modeling (SEM) visualizations indicated that increasing the extract concentration could provoke considerable cellular damages and morphological changes, consistent with ROS generations and protein leakage [
 <xref rid="B113-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. In two different studies, the antibacterial and antiadhesive activity of 
 <italic>M. piperita</italic> ethanol extract on beverage spoilage bacteria was investigated on some acetic acid bacteria of 
 <italic>Asaia</italic> genus, showing that the mint extract caused a reduction in cell adhesion of 
 <italic>As. Bogorensis</italic> and 
 <italic>As. Lannensis</italic> and biofilm formation through its antibacterial activity and its direct effects on extracellular substances [

 <xref rid="B113-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. Husain et al. reported that treatment of 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 by MPEO resulted in a decrease in the production of: LasB elastase (the major virulence factor); pyocyanin (a toxin produced and secreted by 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>) up to 85%; exopolymeric substance (EPS); Î²-galactosidase activity up to 54.5%; acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) levels that regulate virulence factors and biofilm formation in 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>Aeromonas hydrophila</italic> [
