<p>Limited data are available on clinical trials using 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> species in humans [
 <xref rid="B190-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">190</xref>], and indeed only two works reported the use of 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> species in humans related to cancer. First a randomized, double-blind clinical trial was conducted in 200 patients to determine the efficacy of volatile oils of 
 <italic>Mentha piperita</italic> or 
 <italic>Mentha spicata</italic> in preventing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in four groups, control, placebo, 
 <italic>M. piperita, M. spicata</italic>. The results showed a significant reduction in the intensity and number of emetic events in the first 24 h with 
 <italic>M. spicata</italic> and 
 <italic>M. piperita</italic> in both treatment groups (
 <italic>p</italic>&lt; 0.05) when compared with the control and no adverse effects were reported. The cost of treatment was also reduced when essential oils were used [
 <xref rid="B191-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">191</xref>]. The second work is another randomized, double blind placebo clinical trial conducted in 60 patients to evaluate the effects of 
 <italic>Mentha piperita</italic> (and 
 <italic>Matricaria recutita</italic>) on oral mucositis (OM) in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) [
 <xref rid="B192-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">192</xref>]. OM is one of the most common side effects of intensive chemotherapy in patients undergoing HSCT. Patients who received herbal mouthwash three times daily for 1 week before HSCT showed significant improvements in pain intensity (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.009), dryness (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.04) and dysphagia (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.009), suggesting a therapeutic role for 
 <italic>M. piperita</italic> in OM.
