Today, more than 30% of all medicinal drugs (and their derivatives and analogs) derive from plants, and natural products will continue to possess considerable impact in human medicine. Most synthetic bioactive drugs are structurally similar to the phytochemicals of plants from which they were firstly isolated [

In addition, due to contraindications in the usage of chemical drugs, there is a growing interest in the utilization of the plant-derived medicinal products [
