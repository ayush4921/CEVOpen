<p>The essential oils’ chemical profile is influenced by environmental factors, contributing to their primary and secondary constituents’ chemical variability. This fact takes along several chemical profiles, chemotypes, or different chemical races to the same species. Therefore, it is worth considering that minor constituents in essential oils can play an essential role in the chemical polymorphism of a given species [
