 <italic>Psidium myrtoides</italic> leaf essential oils recorded in some Brazilian states were classified into three chemical profiles, according to their primary constituents. These oil records were rich in mono- and sesquiterpenes with acyclic, 
 <italic>p</italic>-menthane, pinane, caryophyllane, germacrane, elemane, cadinane, and bisabolane skeleton types. Profile I from Federal District (Midwest Brazil) showed 
 <italic>E</italic>-caryophyllene (22.4%), caryophyllene oxide (19.7%), α-humulene (8.4%), and myrcene (5.4%) as the main constituents [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-26-00965" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Profile II from Ceará state (Northeast Brazil) was dominated by 1,8-cineole (29.9–48.1%), α-eudesmol (11.7–20.0%), α-pinene (5.0–12.8%), elemol (3.3–6.0%), and γ-eudesmol (2.5–5.8%) [

 <italic>E</italic>-caryophyllene (19.4–30.9%), α-humulene (10.4–15.9%), α-bisabolol (7.3–10.4%), α-copaene (6.3–7.8%), and caryophyllene oxide (5.3–7.3%) as the primary components [
