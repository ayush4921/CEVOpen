<p>In recent years, reviews have been published referring to essential oils from Myrtaceaeâ€™s largest genera, such as 
 <italic>Myrcia, Eugenia</italic>, and 
 <italic>Syzygium</italic> [

 <xref rid="B16-molecules-26-00965" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. A review of essential oils from Myrtaceae describing various chemical analyses of 
 <italic>Psidium</italic> species has also been published [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-26-00965" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, there is no review focusing jointly on the chemical compositions and biological activities of essential oils of 
 <italic>Psidium</italic> species. Due to the chemical and biological significance of 
 <italic>Psidium</italic> species, in this review, there are 110 chemical analyses reported of 18 
 <italic>Psidium</italic> species growing widespread in the world and their biological activities.
