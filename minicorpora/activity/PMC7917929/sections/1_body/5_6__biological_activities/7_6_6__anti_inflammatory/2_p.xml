<p>Three 
 <italic>P. guajava</italic> leaf oils recorded in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, showed anti-inflammatory activity in pleurisy induced by lipopolysaccharide model with inhibition in migration of eosinophils between 67% and 76% at 100 mg/kg. In these oils, predominated the caryophyllane-type compounds, as α-humulene (13.0–37.0%), 
 <italic>E</italic>-caryophyllene (7.2–24.0%), β-selinene (7.7–14.0%), α-selinene (10.0–12.0%), α-muurolol (7.6–9.6%), cedr-8-(15)-en-9-α-ol (7.4–7.6%), humulene epoxide II (6.6%), and caryophyllene oxide (5.0%) [

 <italic>P. guajava</italic> from Egypt, rich in 
 <italic>E</italic>-caryophyllene (16.9% and 17.6%), limonene (0.2% and 11.0%), selin-7(11)-en-4-α-ol (8.3% and 0.5%), α-selinene (6.5% and 6.6%), β-selinene (6.3% and 6.4%), 1,8-cineole (5.4% and 0.8%), and δ-cadinene (5.3% and 4.9%), showed a moderate activity when tested in vitro on 5-lipoxygenase inhibition, exhibiting IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 49.76 μg/mL for the fruits, and 32.53 μg/mL for the leaves [
