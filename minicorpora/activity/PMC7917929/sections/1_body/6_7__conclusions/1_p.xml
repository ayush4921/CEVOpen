<p>The 
 <italic>Psidium</italic> genus essential oils present a significant chemical variability. They are composed of mono- and sesquiterpenes with acyclic (C
 <sub>10</sub> and C
 <sub>15</sub>), 
 <italic>p</italic>-menthane, pinane, bisabolane, germacrane, caryophyllane, cadinane, and aromadendrene skeleton-types. Geographical occurrence and seasonality can influence the chemical composition of 
 <italic>Psidium</italic> essential oils. Also, it has exhibited a wide range of biological activities, directly influenced by its chemical variability. Although 
 <italic>Psidium</italic> species display a broad spectrum of ethnomedicinal uses, studies on their biological activities are mostly restricted to 
 <italic>P. guajava</italic> and 
 <italic>P. cattleyanum</italic> species. Furthermore, a reduced number of species with known chemical composition, 18 species of 266 contained in the genus, from 110 studied samples. Thus, it is necessary to further explore the volatile content of 
 <italic>Psidium</italic> species and their therapeutic properties. Variations in the chemical profile of the species indicate the importance of optimizing protocols for the collection, processing, and extraction of plant material.
