<p>According to Debela et al. [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], unless the situation is reversed by a collective effort, there is a fear of extinction of this wild edible fruit in the near future particularly from the rate of deforestation, selective removal, and indiscriminate degradation of local habitat and expansion of grazing and farmlands. This report also sets the most important conservation options which can reverse the problem are sustaining multipurpose uses, rehabilitating, improving the ecosystem and enhancing its services, enhance resilience to climate change, promoting indigenous knowledge, diversify food sources, and biocultural heritage.
