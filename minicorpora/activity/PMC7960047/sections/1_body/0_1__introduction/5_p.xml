<p>The Ethiopian flora is estimated to contain between 6500 and 7000 species of higher plants of which about 12% is endemic [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Reports indicated that about 8% of the nearly 7000 higher plants of the country are edible. Of these, 203 wild and semiwild plant species are documented [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. But there are many other wild edible plants that are not documented. More recently, some ethnobotanical studies were undertaken in some parts of the country [
