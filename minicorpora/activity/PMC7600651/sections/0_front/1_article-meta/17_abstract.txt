0: Peppermint (  Mentha piperita L.) and chamomile (  Chamomilla recutita (L.) Rausch.)
1: are aromatic plants with considerable economic value.
2: These plants and their essential oils are used in medicine, cosmetics, and the food industry.
3: One of the main limiting factors in peppermint and chamomile commercial cultivation is weed competition since weeds are able to decrease both oil amount and biomass yield.
4: The purpose of the present study was to determine the effect of parasitism by field dodder (  Cuscuta campestris Yunck.)
5: on peppermint and chamomile dry weight and their essential oil yield and composition.
6: Essential oils from both noninfested and infested peppermint and chamomile plants were obtained by hydrodistillation and characterized chemically by gas chromatography (GC) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS).
7: The amount of dry matter accumulated by peppermint and chamomile plants infested by field dodder was lower (25% and 63%, respectively) compared to noninfested plants.
8: Essential oil yield increased for peppermint (3.87% (  v/  w) and 3.63% (  v/  w)), but decreased for chamomile (0.2% (  v/  w) and 0.5% (  v/  w)) both from infested and noninfested plants, respectively.
9: The oil composition profile significantly differed in terms of content.
10: In peppermint plants, field dodder infestation increased menthone content by 23%, and decreased the content of both menthol by 11% and pulegone by 67%.
11: Furthermore, -cadinene was detected only in oil extracted from infested peppermint plants.
12: Compared to peppermint, chamomile plants were significantly more affected by field dodder in terms of essential oil yield, as well as oil composition and plant dry weight.
13: In chamomile plants, (  E)-dendrolasin was detected in the oil of noninfested plants, and 1,4-dimethyl-7-(1-methylethyl)-azulen-2-ol was detected only in the oil of infested plants.
