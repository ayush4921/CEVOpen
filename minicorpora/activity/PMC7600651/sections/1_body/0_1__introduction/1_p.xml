<p>Plant secondary metabolites play a recognized role in interactions between plants and their environment and they also act as defense chemicals [
 <xref rid="B1-plants-09-01286" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Production of these compounds is very low (less than 1% dry weight) and mainly depends on the physiological and developmental stage of plants [
 <xref rid="B2-plants-09-01286" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-plants-09-01286" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Production and accumulation of metabolites by plants of the same species growing in different regions may be affected by environmental factors, so that such substances appear to act as a chemical interface between the plant and the surrounding environment [

 <xref rid="B4-plants-09-01286" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5-plants-09-01286" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Although secondary metabolites of medicinal and aromatic plants are commonly generated through genetic processes, their biosynthesis depends to a great extent on environmental factors, both abiotic (soil type, water availability, nutrient solubility, light, UV radiation, location, edaphic and seasonal variation, etc.) and biotic, which affect growth parameters, essential oil yield and oil constituents [

 <xref rid="B11-plants-09-01286" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] indicated that irrigation regimes and field capacity affected the yield of dry chamomile flowers and essential oil percent and its composition. Å alamon et al. [
 <xref rid="B12-plants-09-01286" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] showed a strong impact of edaphic and seasonal variations on the composition of essential oil from chamomile originating from various parts of Iran. Santoro et al. [
 <xref rid="B13-plants-09-01286" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] revealed that some vegetative parameters (shoot and root lengths, shoot fresh weight, root dry weight, etc.) of peppermint increased upon exposure to volatile organic compounds from two different plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (
 <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic> and 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>). Besides, the authors showed that rhizobacterial volatile organic compounds impacted the formation of plant secondary compounds, finding a two-fold increase in the accumulation of essential oil from peppermint plants treated with 
 <italic>P. fluorescens,</italic> compared to 
 <italic>B. subtilis.</italic> Guo et al. [
 <xref rid="B14-plants-09-01286" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] revealed some beneficial effects of colonization of peppermint roots by the fungus 
 <italic>Trichoderma viride</italic> as it elevated essential oil yield and composition.
