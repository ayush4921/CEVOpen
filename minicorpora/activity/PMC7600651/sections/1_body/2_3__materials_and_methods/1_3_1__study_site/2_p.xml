 <italic>Agropyrum repens</italic> (L.) Beauv., 
 <italic>Cirsium arvense</italic> (L.) Scop. and 
 <italic>Sorghum halepense</italic> (L.) Pers. The most abundant species was 
 <italic>A. arvensis</italic> with more than 12 plants/m
 <sup>2</sup>. The other weeds were counted in fewer than 4 plants/m
 <sup>2</sup>. In the spring of 2017, the spontaneous appearance of field dodder seedlings was also noted in both fields. Additional tests (seedling emergence) revealed that field dodder seeds were introduced into the fields with compost. Over the next few weeks, field dodder infestation was monitored. The autotrophic weeds, in stage from cotyledons to 2â€“4 true leaves, were manually removed from all plots in the peppermint and chamomile fields. Weed management is important because weeds and crops grow under competition for light, space, soil moisture and nutrients. In addition, the presence of autotrophic weeds in crops infested with field dodder can increase the degree of infestation with this parasitic plant, playing the role of intermediated host. Therefore, manual weeding was extended until the end of the experiment.
