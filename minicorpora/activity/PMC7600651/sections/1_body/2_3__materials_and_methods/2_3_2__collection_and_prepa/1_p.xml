<p>The experiment was set up over an area of 500 m
 <sup>2</sup> for each plant species and it included the following variants: Np—noninfested peppermint plants (control); Ip—infested peppermint plants; Nc—noninfested chamomile plants (control); Ic—infested chamomile plants. There were five plots in each variant and the plot size was 6.25 × 4 m (25 m
 <sup>2</sup>), while the distance between plots was 2 m. A wooden quadrat frame (50 cm × 50 cm) was used for sampling. Ten quadrats (two per plot) were sampled for each variant of the experiment. Samples collected from all 10 quadrats were added together and considered to constitute a representative sample of the community.
