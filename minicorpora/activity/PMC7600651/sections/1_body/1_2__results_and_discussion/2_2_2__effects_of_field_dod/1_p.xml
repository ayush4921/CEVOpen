<p>In chamomile plants, dry biomass weight and essential oil yield were more affected by field dodder infestation than in peppermint plants (
 <xref rid="plants-09-01286-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="plants-09-01286-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The dry weight biomass of field dodder plants was observed as 39.49 g ± 0.48, which induced a 2.7-fold reduction in aerial biomass in chamomile plants from 0.83 g ± 0.06 in noninfested plants to 0.31 g ± 0.05 in infested plants. The obtained data showed that the essential oil yield from noninfested plants (0.5% 
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) was 2.5-fold higher than it was from infested plants (0.2% 
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>), which clearly indicates a strong influence of field dodder on the composition of chamomile secondary metabolites studied (
 <xref rid="plants-09-01286-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Different host plant responses to field dodder as a parasite may be partially associated with tendencies associated with plant stress response of different plant taxa, and potentially suggest some unknown stress response mechanisms in host plants [
 <xref rid="B44-plants-09-01286" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Parasitic plants inhibit host growth and reproduction by capturing their nutrients, and so disturbing their balance of resources [
 <xref rid="B28-plants-09-01286" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Differences in infestation levels of different hosts by the same 
 <italic>Cuscuta</italic> sp. may result from their different nutrient status or their size (metabolic activities) [
 <xref rid="B45-plants-09-01286" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The parasitic genus 
 <italic>Cuscuta</italic> is known to constitute a strong competitive sink as its species divert a large portion of photoassimilates of their hosts into their tissues [

 <xref rid="B46-plants-09-01286" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,

 <xref rid="B48-plants-09-01286" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. However, Sarić-Krsmanović et al. [
 <xref rid="B26-plants-09-01286" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] revealed higher contents of some nutrients in infested than in noninfested alfalfa and sugar beet plants. A final assessment (40 days after infestation) revealed that field dodder raised the contents of N, P2O5, K2O and organic nutrients in infested alfalfa plants, while infested sugar beet plants had higher contents of N and organic nutrients than noninfested plants. Similarly, 
 <italic>Cuscuta reflexa</italic> infestation results in stimulated host nitrate uptake, and higher rates of photosynthesis in both young and mature leaves compared with control plants [

 <xref rid="B50-plants-09-01286" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Field dodder also had a strong impact on pigment contents (chlorophyll 
 <italic>a</italic> and 
 <italic>b</italic>, carotenoids) in alfalfa and sugar beet plants [
 <xref rid="B26-plants-09-01286" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Similarly, Sarić-Krsmanović et al. [
 <xref rid="B51-plants-09-01286" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] confirmed that this parasitic plant also affected several parameters of chlorophyll fluorescence (minimal fluorescence, variable/maximal fluorescence ratio, effective fluorescence yield, variable fluorescence, and intensity of fluorescence).
