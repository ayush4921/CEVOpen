<p>Chemical compositions of the essential oils of noninfested and infested peppermint plants are presented in

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-09-01286">Supplementary Materials (Figures S1 and S2)</xref>. In both oils, from infested and noninfested plants, 38 identified components accounted for 99.35 and 99.45% (
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic>) of total mass, respectively. Considering the yields (%,

 <xref rid="plants-09-01286-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), and density (0.90 and 0.91 g/mL) of essential oils from infested and noninfested plants, the identified compounds made up 3.46% (
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic>) and 3.29% (
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic>) of infested and noninfested plant biomass used for essential oil isolation, respectively. Menthone and menthol were the main components of peppermint essential oil, regardless of the field dodder infection status. Menthone content increased by 23%, while menthol content decreased by 11% in the oil extracted from infested peppermint plants, as compared to noninfested plants. Other oil components that were reduced in peppermint by field dodder infestation were (
 <italic>E</italic>)-β-ocimene by 42% and γ-terpinene by 38%. In contrast, field dodder infestation increased the content of some oil components, not only menthone but also trans-sabinol, piperitone, δ-selinene and viridiflorol (

On the other hand, a minor δ-cadinene level (0.09%) was only detected in the essential oil of infested peppermint. Essential oils of peppermint originating from Serbia usually contain δ-cadinene as a component [

 <xref rid="B34-plants-09-01286" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Considering the very low δ-cadinene level (0.09%), it seems that peppermint plants do not metabolize any additional components in response to the presence of field dodder. In addition, the essential oil of infested peppermint plants (
 <xref rid="plants-09-01286-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) did not contain compounds previously reported for different 
 <italic>Cuscuta</italic> species (vanillin, eugenol, α-cadinene) [
