<p>The present study revealed a strong negative impact of field dodder infestation on peppermint aerial dry weight (
 <xref rid="plants-09-01286-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The dry weight of aerial biomass of noninfested peppermint plants (1.24 g ± 0.09) was 1.3-fold higher than the dry weight of infested plants (0.94 g ± 0.08), while the dry weight biomass of field dodder was 46.68 g ± 0.51.
