<p>Regardless of the status of peppermint plants, the contents of the predominant oxygenated monoterpenes (
 <xref rid="plants-09-01286-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) were high and very similar (84.18 and 83.54% in infested and noninfested plants, respectively). The contents of other chemical classes were also similar. Thus, monoterpene hydrocarbons accounted for 3.81 and 4.25% of infested and noninfested peppermint plants, respectively, while sesquiterpene hydrocarbons represented 4.44 and 4.14%, and oxygenated sesquiterpenes accounted for 1.04 and 0.97%, respectively. All other compounds made 0.60 and 0.47% of the noninfested and infested oils, respectively (
