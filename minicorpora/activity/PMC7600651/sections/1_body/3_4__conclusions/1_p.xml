<p>Chemical analyses revealed significant differences in the content of individual components in the tested peppermint (
 <italic>M. piperita</italic>) and chamomile (
 <italic>C. recutita</italic>) essential oils from noninfested plants and those infested with field dodder (
 <italic>C. campestris</italic>). These findings are also supported by differences in the obtained essential oil yields and biomass dry weight of peppermint and chamomile plants. Compared to peppermint, chamomile plants were significantly more affected by field dodder in terms of essential oil yield, as well as the composition and dry weight of its biomass.
