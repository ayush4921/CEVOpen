<p id="Par54">In this study, we measured the oil content and absolute content of five main fatty acids of herbaceous peony ‘Hangshao’ seeds at five developmental stages (30, 45, 60, 75 and 90 days after flowering, DAF) by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). We identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids and oil accumulation. Furthermore, we validated the expression of 16 DEGs using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Our results reveal the transcriptomic aspects of unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis and oil accumulation in herbaceous peony seed, and provide a useful reference for fatty acid biosynthesis studies of other plant species.</p>
