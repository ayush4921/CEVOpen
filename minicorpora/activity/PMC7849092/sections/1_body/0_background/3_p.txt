0: Previous research has shown that the ratio of omega-6/omega-3 is approximately 1.5:1 in herbaceous peony Hangshao mature seed oil.
1: However, the ratio of omega-6/omega-3 increases during seed development because the relative content of ALA decreases gradually and the relative content of LA slightly increases [ 10,  11].
2: Nevertheless, very little research has examined fatty acid accumulation at the molecular level for herbaceous peony seed oil.
3: Fatty acid biosynthesis in plants occurs via a very complicated biological pathway regulated by various enzymes.
4: RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) has provided a convenient and rapid method for finding key genes in fatty acid biosynthesis and unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis at the molecular level.
5: De novo transcriptome sequencing had been applied to identify and profile gene expression differences of some herb oilseed plants such as soybean [ 18], peanut [ 19], rape [ 20], and sunflower [ 21] and some tree oilseed plants such as tree peony [ 17], olive [ 22], tea-oil camellia [ 23], and  Hiptage benghalensis [ 24].
6: However, research on herbaceous peony has mainly concentrated on thermotolerant-related differentially expressed genes [ 25], codon usage patterns [ 26] and anthocyanin biosynthetic genes [ 27] based on transcriptome sequencing.
7: The fatty acid metabolism of herbaceous peony has remained unknown.
8: Moreover, genetic control of the unsaturated fatty acid accumulation of herbaceous peony is unexplored.
