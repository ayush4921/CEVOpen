0: Herbaceous peony Hangshao seed oil predominantly contains five fatty acids: oleic acid (C18:1 9, OA), linoleic acid (C18:2 9,12, LA), -linolenic acid (C18:3 9,12,15, ALA), palmitic acid (C16:0, PA) and stearic acid (C18:0, SA) [ 10,  11].
1: OA, LA and ALA are classified as UFAs, which include monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs).
2: OA, which can improve diastolic heart function, is a MUFA [ 12].
3: LA and ALA are PUFAs, which can reduce thrombosis, decrease cardiovascular events and prevent cancer [ 13].
4: According to the location of the last double carbon bond relative to the terminal methyl end of the molecule, PUFAs can be divided into the omega-3 (n-3) series and omega-6 (n-6) series.
5: ALA, an important omega-3 PUFA, is an essential fatty acid that cannot be synthesized in the human body and must be obtained via dietary intake; it is the precursor of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which are essential for the growth and development of the brain and retina [ 14].
6: Additionally, LA, an important omega-6 PUFA, is also an essential fatty acid that cannot be produced by the human body; it is the precursor of the omega-6 series of fatty acids such as -linolenic acid (C18:3 6,9,12, GLA) and arachidonic acid (C18:4 5,8,11,14, AA) [ 15].
7: Nevertheless, high intake of omega-6 PUFAs with low intake of omega-3 PUFAs might promote the pathogenesis of many diseases, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, and inflammatory and autoimmune diseases [ 16].
8: Therefore, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations and the World Health Organization (WHO) suggest that the omega-6/3 ratio should be lower than 5:1 [ 17].
