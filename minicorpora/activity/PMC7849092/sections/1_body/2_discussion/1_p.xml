<p id="Par73">Most plants contain accumulated oil (mainly TAG) in their seeds to provide energy for seed germination. Plant oils have great significance in agricultural production, and most are mainly used as edible oil in food processing and preparation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Plant oils contain essential fatty acids, including omega-3 series ALA and omega-6 series LA, which can only be synthesized in plants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The proportion of fatty acids in plant oils, especially the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids, is one of the evaluation criteria for plant oil quality [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. However, the content of LA and ALA constituting different proportions of essential fatty acids have different effects on human physiological functions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. At present, many studies have shown that the intake ratio of LA/ALA has the most significant physiological function at 1:1 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In this study, the oil content of mature seed of herbaceous peony ‘Hangshao’ was approximately 20%, and five main fatty acids including PA, SA, OA, LA and ALA were detected by GC-MS, which is consistent with the findings for other peonies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The absolute contents of the five fatty acid components during seed development were all highest for ALA and lowest for SA. The specific manifestations followed the order ALA&gt;LA&gt;OA&gt;PA&gt;SA. The ratio of LA/ALA was lower during the development of seeds of herbaceous peony ‘Hangshao’, maintained between 0.55 and 0.71, which is close to the optimal intake ratio of 1:1. Therefore, herbaceous peony seed oil has potential to become a new resource of nutrition for specific populations.
