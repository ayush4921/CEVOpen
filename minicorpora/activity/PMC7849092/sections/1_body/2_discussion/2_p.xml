<p id="Par74">Oilseed plants have high contents of seed oil compared with other plants. Despite the similarities of lipid biosynthesis and its components in oilseed plants, the contents of oil and fatty acid vary considerably. However, the regulation of oil content and fatty acid composition is a complex process, which varies in oil biosynthesis phases and accumulation. Nevertheless, the difference in regulatory mechanisms in different species is attributed to the variation in oil content among species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Mainly, the molecular regulators of oil content and fatty acid composition consist of genes involved in fatty acid and TAG assembly [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Therefore, the transcriptome was used to understand the genes, gene networks, regulatory factors and their interactions that direct seed oil biosynthesis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. In this study, a comparative transcriptome was used for the first time to reveal the high oil content and unsaturated fatty acids of the herbaceous peony ‘Hangshao’ seed. Here we de novo assembled the transcript in developing seeds of 
 <italic>P. lactiflora</italic> ‘Hangshao’, resulting in 150,156 unigenes, exceeding the transcriptome data from other oilseed plants such as 
 <italic>Malania oleifera</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], 
 <italic>Camellia oleifer</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and 
 <italic>Paeonia ostii</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. We think that the number of unigenes may have a great divergence in different plants. Even in the same plant, the number of unigenes may be different in various tissues and/or at different stages of development. For example, the unigenes in the buds, stems and budding seeds of 
 <italic>P. lactiflora</italic> were 207,827 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], 107,929 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and 123,577 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], respectively. Of course, it is undeniable that there may be incomplete and redundant stitching in Trinity based on sequencing by using Illumina HiSeq 4000 system. When the length of one gene is relatively long, it is difficult to assemble the full length of the gene, and it is possible that some unigenes actually belong to the part of one gene. In order to obtain as complete unigenes as possible, we took a series of measures. Firstly, we repeated it three times at three different stages to construct the cDNA libraries and sequenced using the Illumina Hiseq 4000 platform. Secondly, sequence adapters, reads with more than 5% N base and low-quality reads (percentage of base with a quality less than 15 greater than 20% in a read) were removed to obtain clean reads. Lastly, all clean reads were assembled using Trinity software [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], and Tgicl software [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] was used to perform clustering and eliminate redundant data in the assembled transcipts to obtain unique genes. The clustering quality metrics are shown as Additional file Table S2. Moreover, we selected 16 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) to analyze the relative expression by qRT-PCR to validate the transcriptome sequencing results. Overall, we found that the expression patterns of 16 DEGs verified by qRT-PCR were highly consistent with the transcriptome sequencing results, indicating that the DEG analysis findings were reliable (Fig.
