<p id="Par68">Most fatty acids in plants are stored in the form of TAG. The fatty acids synthesized in the plasmid are generally transferred from the plastid to the endoplasmic reticulum in the form of fatty acyl-CoA and become a substrate for TAG assembly. First, under catalysis by glycerol-3-phosphoate acyltransferase (GPAT), the fatty acid carbon chain on the fatty acyl-CoA molecule is transferred to the 
 <italic>sn-1</italic> position of glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) to form lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). Then, by catalysis of lyso-phosphatidic acid acyltransferase (LPAAT), phosphatidic acid (PHA) is formed from the 
 <italic>sn-2</italic> position of LPA binding the fatty acid carbon chain of fatty acyl-CoA. Next, PHA is dephosphorylated by phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAP) to form diacylglycerol (DAG). Finally, DAG is catalyzed by diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) to bind the fatty acid carbon chain of fatty acyl-CoA to form TAG at the 
 <italic>sn-3</italic> position. We identified 4, 4, 5 and 1 DEGs as 
 <italic>GPAT</italic>, 
 <italic>LPAAT</italic>, 
 <italic>PAP</italic> and 
 <italic>DGAT</italic>, respectively.
