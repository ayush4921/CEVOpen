<p id="Par63">The analysis of DEGs in 14 KEGG pathways annotated to lipid metabolism found 503 DEGs (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM11" ref-type="media">11</xref>: Table S8) belonging to 111 enzymes. Then, based on the standard FPKM and LOG2 values of different replicates, 111 DEGs were selected for heat map and cluster analysis (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM12" ref-type="media">12</xref>: Table S9 and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The results showed that 111 DEGs for lipid metabolism were clustered into four clusters (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). There were 11, 26, 32 and 42 DEGs in Cluster I, II, III and IV, respectively. The DEGs in Cluster I and II were highly expressed, whereas those in Cluster III and IV were expressed at a relatively low level. Additionally, the average log2 FPKM values for the 11 DEGs in Cluster I and the 42 DEGs in Cluster IV showed an increasing pattern; however, those of the 26 DEGs in Cluster II and 32 DEGs in Cluster III showed a declining pattern (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b).
