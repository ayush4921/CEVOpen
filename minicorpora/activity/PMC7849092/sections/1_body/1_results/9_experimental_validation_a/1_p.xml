<p id="Par72">To validate the DEGs, the relative expression levels of 16 randomly selected DEGs involved in lipid metabolism of KEGG pathway were analyzed by qRT-PCR. Among them, there were 7 DEGs related to fatty acid biosynthesis, namely, 
 <italic>BCCP</italic>, 
 <italic>BC</italic>, 
 <italic>MCAT</italic>, 
 <italic>KASII</italic>, 
 <italic>KASIII</italic>, 
 <italic>FATA</italic> and 
 <italic>FATB</italic>, and 1 DEG was involved in fatty acid elongation (
 <italic>KCR</italic>). Four DEGs were involved in the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, including 
 <italic>SAD</italic>, 
 <italic>FAD2</italic>, 
 <italic>FAD3</italic> and 
 <italic>FAD7</italic>, and 2 DEGs, 
 <italic>GPAT</italic> and 
 <italic>DGAT</italic>, were involved in TAG assembly and 2 DEGs, 
 <italic>OLE</italic> and 
 <italic>CLO</italic>, in lipid storage (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). Overall, the expression patterns of 16 DEGs verified by qRT-PCR were highly consistent with the transcriptome sequencing results, indicating that the DEG analysis findings were reliable.
