<p id="Par66">Fatty acid elongation occurs via long-chain acyl-CoA (C≥16) in endoplasmic reticulum. Fatty acids (C≥16), which are catalyzed by thiolase from fatty acyl-ACP in plastids, are transformed to long-chain acyl-CoA (C≥16) by long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (LACS) and transported to the endoplasmic reticulum. Three DEGs identified as 
 <italic>LACS</italic>. After a series of complicated biochemical reactions, long-chain acyl-CoA (C≥16) was transformed to long-chain acyl-CoA (C+ 2) by 3-ketoacyl-CoA synthase (KCS), very-long-chain 3-oxoacyl-CoA reductase (KCR), very-long-chain (3R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase (HCD) and very-long-chain enoyl-CoA reductase (ECR), and 13, 4, 3 and 3 DEGs were identified as 
 <italic>KCS</italic>, 
 <italic>KCR</italic>, 
 <italic>HCD</italic> and 
 <italic>ECR</italic>, respectively.
