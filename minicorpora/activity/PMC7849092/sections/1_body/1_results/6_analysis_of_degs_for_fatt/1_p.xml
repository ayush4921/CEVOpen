<p id="Par64">To further uncover the key genes associated with the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids and oil accumulation in the developmental herbaceous peony ‘Hangshao’ seed, DEGs in five pathways were analyzed, including fatty acid biosynthesis, fatty acid elongation, biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, triacylglycerol (TAG) biosynthesis and lipid storage (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). First, the DEGs with a log2 value of the FPKM ration in any two periods greater than 1 or less than − 1 were selected. Then, sequences of the DEGs selected above belonging to the same enzyme were compared using Bioxm software. Last, those DEGs with the same sequences were removed. Finally, we identified 123 DEGs involved in fatty acid biosynthesis (39 DEGs), fatty acid elongation (33 DEGs), biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids (24 DEGs), TAG biosynthesis (17 DEGs) and lipid storage (10 DEGs) (Additional file
