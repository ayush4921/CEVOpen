<p id="Par61">DEGs in the three different groups were annotated to five KEGG categories (including cellular processes, environmental information processing, genetic information processing, metabolism and organismal systems) and 19 KEGG subcategories (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>: Table S4). The numbers of DEGs annotated to the KEGG pathway were 1698, 4321 and 6035 for Group I, Group II and Group III, respectively (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>: Table S5). Further analysis of the KEGG annotation showed that 28, 43 and 41 pathways were significantly enriched for Group I, Group II and Group III, respectively (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">9</xref>: Table S6). Among the top 25 enriched pathways in each group, 13 pathways were significantly enriched in all three groups (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). Among them, glycerolipid metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism and sphingolipid biosynthesis belong to lipid metabolism. Additionally, 12 pathways were significantly enriched in two groups, including cutin, suberine and wax biosynthesis and steroid biosynthesis, which belong to lipid metabolism. Moreover, 12 pathways were significantly enriched in only one group, including fatty acid biosynthesis and linoleic acid metabolism. Additionally, 14 pathways were annotated to lipid metabolism (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b and Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">10</xref>:Table S7). Glycerolipid metabolism, fatty acid biosynthesis, arachidonic acid metabolism and sphingolipid metabolism were significantly enriched in all three groups. The number of DEGs in the 4 KEGG pathways mentioned above increased with seed development. Despite no significant enrichment of DEGs in the KEGG pathway of unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis, the number of DEGs also increased with seed development. These results provide clues regarding the identification of key genes involved in the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids.
