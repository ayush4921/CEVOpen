<p id="Par57">After assembly, all the unigenes were subjected to BLASTx analysis against seven public databases, including NR, NT, GO, KOG, KEGG, Swiss-Prot and InterPro (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). A total of 73,399 (48.88%) unigenes were annotated in at least one database, whereas 15,005 (9.99%) unigenes were annotated in all databases. The highest annotation rate was obtained in the NR database, which assigned 67,096 (44.68%) unigenes. A total of 45,488 (30.29%), 42,533 (28.33%) and 48,907 (32.57%) unigenes were annotated using the NT, Swiss-Prot and InterPro database, respectively.
