<p>The volatile constituents of each essential oil were analyzed by GC-MS as previously reported [
 <xref rid="B68-antibiotics-10-00104" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. They were processed using a gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890B; Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with a capillary column (Agilent HP-5MS; 30 m × 0.25 mm; coating thickness, 0.25 μm; Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) and a single quadrupole mass detector (Agilent 5977B; Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA). The analytical conditions were as follows: injector temperature, 220 °C; transfer line temperature, 240 °C; oven temperature programmed, from 60 °C to 240 °C at 3 °C/min; carrier gas, helium at 1 mL/min; injection volume, 1 μL (in 0.5% HPLC grade n-hexane solution); split ratio, 1:25. The full scan acquisition parameters were as follows: scan range, 30
