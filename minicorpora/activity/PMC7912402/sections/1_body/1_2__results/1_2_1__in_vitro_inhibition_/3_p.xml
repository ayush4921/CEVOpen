<p>In addition, the 
 <italic>C.cit</italic> essential oil had a fungicidal effect against 
 <italic>S. cucurbitacearum</italic> from 900 Âµg/mL. Indeed, for 
 <italic>A. alternata</italic>, 
 <italic>C.cit</italic> had fungistatic effects at 0.6 mg/mL and 0.7 mg/mL, and it was fungicidal from 0.8 mg/mL (
 <xref rid="antibiotics-10-00104-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). These data show that the 
 <italic>C.cit</italic> had potent antifungal activity against 
 <italic>A. alternata</italic> and 
 <italic>S. cucurbitacearum</italic> with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.315 mg/mL and 0.102 mg/mL, respectively (

 <italic>L.dent</italic>, 
 <italic>L.hyb</italic>, 
 <italic>M.alt</italic>, 
 <italic>O.maj1</italic>, and 
 <italic>O.maj2</italic> showed moderate antifungal activities against 
 <italic>A. alternata</italic>, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values from 0.473 mg/mL to 0.893 mg/mL, as similarly against 
 <italic>S. cucurbitacearum</italic>, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values from 0.322 mg/mL to 0.884 mg/mL. However, 
 <italic>L.nob</italic> showed only weak antifungal activities against both 
 <italic>A. alternata</italic> and 
 <italic>S. cucurbitacearum</italic>, as seen by its relatively high IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 1.310 mg/mL and 1.248 mg/mL, respectively (
