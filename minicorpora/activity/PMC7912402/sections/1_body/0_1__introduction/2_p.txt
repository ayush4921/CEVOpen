0: The most important unit of the squash crop is the seed, which should be of high quality and pathogen free.
1: The propagation of such seedborne fungi is generally controlled by chemical treatments [ 7, 12, 13].
2: Indeed, there have been many studies on chemical control against seedborne  S. cucurbitacearum [ 14, 15, 16].
3: Sudisha et al.
4: [ 17] reported that seed treatment with the Dithane M-45 (Mancozeb 75% WP) fungicide can reduce the incidence of gummy stem blight in muskmelon crops, although this active ingredient was recently refused approval for use in the European Union, so its use will be banned in few months.
5: Chemical fungicides are generally adopted for disinfestation, disinfection, and protection of seeds and the emerging plantlets.
6: However, these chemicals can also cause environmental pollution due to their high persistence in the soil and water, because of their slow biodegradability [ 18, 19].
