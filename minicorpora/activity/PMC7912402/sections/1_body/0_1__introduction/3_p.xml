<p>In recent years, alternatives to synthetic fungicides have been investigated due to the extensive use of fungicides for plant and seed treatments, the problems of pathogen resistance to fungicides that this causes, and the increased demand for organic and free-of-residue vegetables [

 <xref rid="B23-antibiotics-10-00104" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Natural organic compound, such as plant extracts and essential oils, are among the environmentally friendly alternatives that are being developed and tested for antifungal activities against seedborne pathogens [

 <xref rid="B27-antibiotics-10-00104" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] reported that tea tree essential oil represents a source of sustainable eco-friendly botanical fungicides, because of its efficacy in the control of seedborne fungi. The genus 
 <italic>Cymbopogon</italic> (Poaceae) is known for its essential oils, especially for extracts of lemongrass (
 <italic>Cymbopogon citratus</italic> (DC.) Stapf). The in vitro evaluation of the effectiveness of this essential oil on the main seedborne pathogens of cucurbits was reported previously [
