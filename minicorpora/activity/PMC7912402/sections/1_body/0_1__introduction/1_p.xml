<p>Cucurbits are an important source of income for countries in the Mediterranean basin, with a total production of nearly 3,356,669 tonnes in 2018 [
 <xref rid="B1-antibiotics-10-00104" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Squash (
 <italic>Cucurbita maxima</italic> Duchesne; 
 <italic>Cucurbita moschata</italic> Duchesne) is one of the major cucurbits grown in tropical and temperate regions. 
 <italic>Cucurbita</italic> spp. can be affected by a number of fungal pathogens, which can cause major economic losses [
 <xref rid="B2-antibiotics-10-00104" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The majority of these fungi are seedborne, such as gummy stem blight (with foliar symptoms) and black rot (with fruit symptoms), which are caused by 
 <italic>Stagonosporopsis cucurbitacearum</italic> (Fr.) Aveskamp, Gruyter &amp; Verkley (anamorph: 
 <italic>Phoma cucurbitacearum</italic> (Fr.) Sacc.), synonym 
 <italic>Didymella bryoniae</italic> (Fuckel) Rehm, and which represent serious diseases that are a major constraint to cucurbit production worldwide [

 <xref rid="B4-antibiotics-10-00104" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Nuangmek et al. [
 <xref rid="B5-antibiotics-10-00104" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] reported that losses in cantaloupe can also reach 100% under conditions conducive to 
 <italic>S. cucurbitacearum</italic>. 
 <italic>Alternaria alternata</italic> (Fr.) Keissl. is the agent of leaf spot, which is a further major factor responsible for low cucurbit production. The genus 
 <italic>Alternaria</italic> affects the plant seedlings, leaves, stalks, stems, flowers and fruit. Yield losses of 50% and more can occur under weather conditions that are conducive to leaf spot, and in particular temperatures of 25 to 32 Â°C associated with 40% relative humidity during the day and 95% at night [
 <xref rid="B6-antibiotics-10-00104" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Many other pathogens have been detected on cucurbits seeds, such as
