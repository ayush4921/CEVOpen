0: Essential oils represent novel alternatives to application of synthetic fungicides to control against seedborne pathogens.
1: This study investigated seven essential oils for in vitro growth inhibition of the main seedborne pathogens of cucurbits.
2: Cymbopogon citratus essential oil completely inhibited mycelial growth of   Stagonosporopsis cucurbitacearum and   Alternaria alternata at 0.6 and 0.9 mg/mL, respectively.
3: At 1 mg/mL,   Lavandula dentata,   Lavandula hybrida,   Melaleuca alternifolia,   Laurus nobilis, and two   Origanum majorana essential oils inhibited mycelia growth of   A. alternata by 54%, 71%, 68%, 36%, 90%, and 74%, respectively.
4: S. cucurbitacearum mycelia growth was more sensitive to   Lavandula essential oils, with inhibition of ~74% at 1 mg/mL.
5: To determine the main compounds in these essential oils that might be responsible for this antifungal activity, they were analyzed by gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GC-MS).
6: C. citratus essential oil showed cirtal as its main constituent, while   L. dentata and   L. nobilis essential oils showed eucalyptol.
7: The   M. alternifolia and two   O. majorana essential oils had terpinen-4-ol as the major constituent, while for   L. hybrida essential oil, this was linalool.
8: Thus, in vitro, these essential oils can inhibit the main seedborne fungi of cucurbits, with future in vivo studies now needed to confirm these activities.
