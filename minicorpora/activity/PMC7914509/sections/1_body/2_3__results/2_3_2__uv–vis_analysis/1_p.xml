<p>UV absorbance spectra of the plant extract, DM capped nano ZnO [
 <xref rid="B16-materials-14-00824" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], drug-loaded DM-ZnO nanoemulsion, and standard tryptophan was measured and represented as 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-00824-f002">Figure 2</xref>A,B. The UV spectra confirm the UV absorbance data, which indicates the strong sharp surface at the plasmon resonance wavelength (Î»
 <sub>spr</sub>) at 350 confirming the successful synthesis of DM-ZnO NPs. Strong signals at 320 suggest the presence of polyphenols and anthocyanins in the extracts. These polyphenols and anthocyanins are responsible for interactions in the formation of nanoparticles. Both NPs and NE showed a characteristic signal at 250 nm, which validates the capping of

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-00824-f002">Figure 2</xref>A). Additionally, both NPs and NE validate the presence of tryptophan with evidence of a peak at 300 nm and confirming the entrapment of Try during the loading process of nanoemulsion preparation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-00824-f002">Figure 2</xref>B). For further confirmation, the structural formation changes by SEM and TEM characterizations along with elemental mapping for the presence of metal ion presence were observed.
