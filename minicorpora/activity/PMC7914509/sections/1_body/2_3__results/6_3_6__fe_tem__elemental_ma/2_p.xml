<p>For further confirmation of the morphological understanding, it was subjected to SEM. The morphological image and chemical composition was determined by EDX 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-00824-f007">Figure 7</xref>, which coincides with TEM images. Interestingly, the biggest amounts of ZnO NPs were similar in dimension with a small number of large particles. The ZnO NPs and NEs also showed small agglomeration, which is typical during the green synthesis of NPs. This agglomeration is attributed to the fact that green-synthesized NPs possess a higher surface area and they strongly stick to each other with considerable affinities to form asymmetrical clusters
