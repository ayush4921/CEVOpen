<p>The collected sample was washed in order to remove all unwanted remains of fine particles. The washed and air-dried plant (10 g) was taken in a conical flask with 100 mL DW and extracted twice for 60 min at 100 °C under reduced pressure. To remove any suspends, the aqueous extract was separated using filtration and then centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min. The clear light brown supernatant was preserved at low temperature (4–5 °C) for further experiments [
