<p>The nanoemulsion was prepared using the ultrasonication technique with the oil in water emulsion method. The high energy was gained using the probe sonicator with an amplitude of 60% for 5 min having a 5 s pulse rate. Tryptophan was dissolved in 10% water in ethanol, along olive oil and tween 80, which is used as a surfactant for nanoemulsion preparation. The conditions for sonication were determined referring the earlier optimized conditions. Loading of tryptophan was carried out at 0–5° to avoid any excessive heat generation preferential due to the cavitation phenomenon. The stability is determined by the size for longer storage and it also helps in the drug-loading capability during the preparation of nanoformulation. Different formulation samples S1, S2, and S3 were prepared with three different conditions (
