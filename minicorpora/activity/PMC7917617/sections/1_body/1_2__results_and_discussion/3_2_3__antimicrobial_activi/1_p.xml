<p>The EO of 
 <italic>L. pubescens</italic> was tested at two concentrations (200 µg and 300 µg per well) to obtain better information about its efficacy in comparison with its most abundant constituent (carvacrol). The EO exerted better inhibitory results against 
 <italic>A. baumannii</italic> (CRE) ATCC 1605, compared to those obtained with carvacrol. This increased efficacy could be a synergistic effect of other constituents of 
 <italic>L. pubescens</italic> EO. When testing carvacrol, inhibition zones were more pronounced than those of the crude oil for 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> ATCC 12228 (15 mm) and 
 <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> ATCC 700720 (20 mm), 
 <italic>A. baumannii</italic> (CRE) ATCC 1605 (15 mm), and 
 <italic>S. sonnei</italic> ATCC 25931 (15 mm). Gram-positive strains were more sensitive to the antibiotic vancomycin (30µg disc), showing more pronounced inhibition zones for 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic> (18.5 mm) and 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> (28 mm).
