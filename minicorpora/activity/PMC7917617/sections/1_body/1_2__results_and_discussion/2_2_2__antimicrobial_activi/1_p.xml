<p>The EOs of 
 <italic>L. pubescens</italic>, 
 <italic>P. incisa</italic> ssp. 
 <italic>candolleana</italic>, and 
 <italic>J. procera</italic> leaves were tested against 13 different microbial strains, using diffusion assay on agar plates at the concentration of 20 µL per well (equivalent to 200 µg); vancomycin, amikacin (30 µg per disc), and ciprofloxacin were used as positive controls (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00959-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Only the EO of 
 <italic>L. pubescens</italic> was significantly active, and, among all tested strains, only towards 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> ATCC 51299 (inhibition zone 12 mm), 
 <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> ATCC 12228 (10 mm), 
 <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> ATCC 700720 (13 mm), 
 <italic>A. baumannii</italic> (CRE) ATCC 1605 (15 mm), and 
 <italic>Shigella sonnei</italic> ATCC 25931 (11 mm). 
 <italic>A. baumannii</italic> has been reported by Haseeb et al. (2016) to be among the most common isolated Gram-negative pathogens, with high resistance rate to tobramycin, and 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic> and 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> are the most frequently reported Gram-negative pathogens during pilgrimage season [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-26-00959" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In addition, antibiotic-resistant 
 <italic>S. sonnei</italic> infections are commonly reported in mass gathering events [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-26-00959" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Thus, finding antimicrobial activity in the EO of 
 <italic>L. pubescens</italic> that works against these reported resistant pathogens will open the door to utilizing the essential oil of this plant as an alternative natural control against the spread of resistant pathogens during mass gatherings.
