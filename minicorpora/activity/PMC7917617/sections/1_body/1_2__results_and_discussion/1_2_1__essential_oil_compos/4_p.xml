<p>All EOs distilled from the different parts of 
 <italic>J. procera</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00959-f001">Figure 1</xref>c) were compared, revealing minor chemical differences. EO compositions showed some common compounds in all the investigated parts, such as α-pinene (31.3–62.5%), δ-3-carene (7.3–30.3%), α-humulene (1.5–6.9%), β-caryophyllene (1.6–6.4%), and β-pinene (3.3–4.6%). Ripe and unripe fruits showed the least differences, while the stems EO contained higher percentages of β-bisabolene (9.1%), which was completely absent in leaf and fruit EOs. A previous study on the fruit EO of 
 <italic>J. procera</italic> reported the presence of eugenol as the main constituent (78.4%); although this phenylpropanoid was completely absent in our sample, these two compositions shared the presence of α-pinene and β-caryophyllene, even in different percentages [

The EOs of the leaves reported in this study shared some constituents with Ethiopian samples, whose literature-reported EOs compositions showed α-pinene (28.1%), δ-3-carene (29.6%), β-pinene (4.35%), elemol (1.8%) and terpinolene (4.1%) [
