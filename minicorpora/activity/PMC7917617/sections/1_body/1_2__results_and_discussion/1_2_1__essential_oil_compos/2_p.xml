 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00959-f001">Figure 1</xref>a) revealed a total of 19 different compounds. Oxygenated monoterpenes were the predominant class, accounting for 70.1% of the whole oil. Among them, carvacrol (55.7%) and methyl carvacrol (13.4%) were the main constituents. Monoterpene hydrocarbons were the second most abundant class, which included terpinolene (6.1%), 
 <italic>(Z)</italic>-β-ocimene (4.1%) and myrcene (3.5%) among the most represented compounds. Sesquiterpene hydrocarbons accounted for 13.1%, with β-bisabolene as the most abundant (9.1%). The predominance of carvacrol and methyl carvacrol as the most abundant compounds in the 
 <italic>L. pubescens</italic> EO of this study is in accordance with published compositions of the EOs hydrodistilled from several Yemeni specimens [
