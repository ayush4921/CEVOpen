0: Plants represent valuable sources of bioactive molecules belonging to various classes of secondary metabolites.
1: Among the physiological roles of secondary metabolites in plants, is the resistance to phytopathogens, including bacteria, fungi and viruses [ 1, 2, 3].
2: The majority of these metabolites have the ability to interact with cellular enzymes or cell structure, causing irreversible damage to the invasive microorganisms [ 4, 5, 6].
3: For this reason, plant secondary metabolites have become an interesting target for the discovery of new bioactive molecules with antimicrobial effects and variable modes of action, especially after the recent emergence and growth of antibiotic resistance.
4: According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the current rise in antibiotic resistance is due to the misuse of pharmaceutical antibiotics and is a major cause of the prolongation of illness with higher risk of death [ 7].
