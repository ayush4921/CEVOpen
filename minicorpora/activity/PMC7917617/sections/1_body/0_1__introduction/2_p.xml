<p>Essential oils (EOs) have numerous commercial applications due to their diverse biological properties and appealing fragrances. The global market thus supports a wide variety of pharmaceutical products such as gels, creams, ointments, nano-emulsions, and patches [

 <xref rid="B11-molecules-26-00959" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Besides their exceptional antimicrobial effects, they also possess a wide range of pharmacological properties, including, for example, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, anti-parasitic, anticancer and antioxidant activity [

 <xref rid="B16-molecules-26-00959" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The use of EOs in therapy has increased in recent times due to the rise in multidrug-resistant bacteria and the high costs of new generation antibiotic drugs [

 <xref rid="B18-molecules-26-00959" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], sesquiterpenes [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-26-00959" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], diterpenes [

 <xref rid="B22-molecules-26-00959" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], phenylpropanoids [

 <xref rid="B23-molecules-26-00959" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and phenols [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-26-00959" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This large variety of chemical structures means that no single enzyme is able to deactivate all of these compounds. Thus, EOs may represent an open frontier for advances in medicine and pharmaceutical sciences.
