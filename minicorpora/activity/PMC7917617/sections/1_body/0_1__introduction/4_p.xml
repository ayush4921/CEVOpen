 <italic>L. pubescens</italic> is reported in the literature as a species commonly found among the wild flora in Middle-Eastern Asia and Mediterranean Africa; it is, indeed, mainly reported as growing in Palestine [

 <italic>Pulicaria</italic> spp. are reported as widely used in Northern African folk-medicine [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-26-00959" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. These species have been chosen for their good availability in the wild, which makes them an exploitable and easy to gather biomass in their native range.
