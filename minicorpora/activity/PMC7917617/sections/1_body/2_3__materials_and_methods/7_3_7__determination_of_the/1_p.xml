<p>MICs and MBCs of 
 <italic>L. pubescens</italic> EO, carvacrol, ciprofloxacin, and vancomycin hydrochloride were determined with the broth micro-dilution method, with sterile 96-well microtiter plates for the determination of the MIC and MBCs of the tested samples. All samples were dissolved in DMSO, with exception of vancomycin hydrochloride which was dissolved in water. Basically, the first column in microtiter plates contained 200 µL of EO, carvacrol, or antibiotics and the other subsequent wells contained 100 µL of Mueller–Hinton broth. EO, carvacrol and antibiotic were serially diluted by transferring 100 µL to the next well to produce serial dilutions. Mueller–Hinton broth (100 µL containing the bacteria 0.5 McFarland) was added to each well containing 100 µL of the tested EO, carvacrol or antibiotics. Sterilized Mueller–Hinton broth alone was used as the negative control, and bacterial broth with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was only used as control. The microdilution plates were incubated at 37 °C overnight. The MIC was determined by selecting the lowest concentration of sample that completely inhibited the growth of the organism and compared with the growth control (

The MBC was determined by taking 10 μL of the selected column and placing it on the Mueller–Hinton agar plates as well. All plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C and the colony forming units (CFUs) were counted. MIC was determined by selecting the lowest concentration of the tested sample that completely inhibited the visible growth of a microorganism after overnight incubation in the well. The MBC was defined as the lowest concentration of the sample that prevents any growth of an organism after being sub-cultured on the Mueller–Hinton agar plate [
