<p>Gas chromatography-electron impact mass spectrometry (GC-EIMS) analyses were performed with an Agilent 7890B gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with an Agilent HP-5MS (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm; coating thickness 0.25 µm) and an Agilent 5977B single quadrupole mass detector (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA). The oven temperature program was set to rise from 60 °C to 240 °C at 3 °C/min. Temperatures were set as follows: injector temperature, 220 °C; transfer-line temperature, 240 °C. The carrier gas was He, at 1 mL/min flow. The acquisition was performed with the following parameters: full scan, with a scan range of 35–300 
 <italic>m/z</italic>; scan time: 1.0 s; threshold: 1 count. The identification of the constituents was based on the comparison of their retention times (t
 <sub>R</sub>) with those of pure reference samples and of their linear retention indices (LRIs), which were determined relatively to the t
 <sub>R</sub> of a series of 
 <italic>n</italic>-alkanes (C9–C25). The detected mass spectra were compared with those listed in the commercial libraries NIST 14 and ADAMS, as well as in a homemade mass-spectral library, built up from pure substances and components of EOs of known composition and MS literature data [
