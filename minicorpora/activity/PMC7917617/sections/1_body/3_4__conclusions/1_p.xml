<p>This study proposed the use of aromatic wild-growing species of Saudi Arabia as potential, natural sources of bioactive antimicrobial agents. As available and exploitable biomass, local wild-growing species can represent a promising source of new bioactive natural compounds, especially in the light of alternatives to traditional medicinal compounds, towards which antibiotic-resistance is a scary but growing phenomenon. Moreover, their availability and the facility of the proposed extraction method (hydrodistillation) constitute a remarkable cost reduction compared to existing antimicrobial agents.</p>
