0: Arabian flora is a rich source of bioactive compounds.
1: In this study, we investigated three aromatic plant species with the aim of finding valuable sources of antimicrobial agents against common pathogenic microorganisms.
2: We focused especially on microorganisms, which cause outbreaks of infectious disease during mass gatherings and pilgrimages season in Saudi Arabia.
3: The essential oils of three aromatic plant species were hydrodistilled from flowering aerial parts of   Lavandula pubescens Decne.
4: and   Pulicaria incisa subsp.
5: candolleana E.Gamal-Eldin, and from leaves, stems, ripe and unripe fruits of   Juniperus procera Hochst.
6: Ex Endl.
7: They were subsequently analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry   (GC-MS).
8: The main constituents of   L. pubescens were found to be carvacrol (55.7%), methyl carvacrol (13.4%), and -bisabolene (9.1%).
9: P. incisa subsp.
10: Candolleana essential oil was rich in linalool (33.0%), chrysanthenone (10.3%), eugenol (8.9%), and   cis-chrysanthenol (8.0%); the major components of   J. procera essential oil were -pinene (31.362.5%) and -3-carene (7.330.3%).
11: These essential oils were tested against thirteen American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria using the agar diffusion assay.
12: The only effective essential oil was that of   L. pubescens and the most sensitive strains were   Acinetobacter baumannii,   Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella sonnei,   Enterococcus faecalis and   Staphylococcus epidermidis.
13: Carvacrol, the major constituent of   L. pubescens, was tested on these strains and was compared with vancomycin, amikacin, and ciprofloxacin.
14: The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) assays of   L. pubescens essential oil and carvacrol revealed that Gram-negative strains were more susceptible than the Gram-positive ones.
