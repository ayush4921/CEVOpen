<p>Due to the high content of biologically active compounds in the 
 <italic>S. hortensis</italic> L. extract, they can modify the metabolism of skin cells. The survival of skin cells, especially melanoma, was significantly reduced by extracts F2 and F3, which can be attributed to the relatively high concentrations of nonvolatile polyphenols rutin, rosmarinic acid, and the high level of volatile monoterpenoid phenol—carvacrol contained in the extracts. Literature data indicate that carvacrol, the dominant monoterpen also in 
 <italic>S. montana</italic> L., very strongly inhibits cell growth in various cell models, particularly in the A549 tumor cell line [

 <italic>S. hortensis</italic> L. oil showed that the oil from this plant and its main component—carvacrol (which accounts for about 80% of volatile compounds in the F2 vegetation phase when polyphenols rutin and rosmarinic acid content was highest) was highly cytotoxic for human breast cancer cells—MDA MB231 and therefore it has been suggested that this compound may have potential therapeutic significance in the treatment of cancer [
 <xref rid="B42-antioxidants-10-00053" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. However, so far, the cytotoxicity of this monoterpene for epidermal cells (both normal and neoplastic) has not yet been analyzed. The obtained results indicate that F2 extract from 
 <italic>S. hortensis</italic> L. may have a differentiating effect on the response of normal and cancer cells because this extract is cytotoxic to melanoma already at a concentration of 12.5 μg/mL, in the absence of cytotoxicity to melanocytes. Therefore, this extract may be a potential therapeutic element in relation to skin melanoma.
