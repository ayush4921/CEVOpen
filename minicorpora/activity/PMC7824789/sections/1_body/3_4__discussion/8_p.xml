<p>Regardless of the antioxidant activity of the polyphenols contained in 
 <italic>S. hortensis</italic> L. extracts, other components of the extract can completely modify the lipid peroxidation process. Earlier it was pointed out that carvacrol present in very high concentration in 
 <italic>S. hortensis</italic> L. extract may increase the permeability of bacterial cell membranes, which leads to their death [
 <xref rid="B53-antioxidants-10-00053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. It can be suggested that the results of this study confirm the opposite effect of carvacrol on lipid peroxidation than polyphenols. The consequence of this is an increase in lipid peroxidation for extracts from V2 phase, full flowering and end of flowering, and at higher concentrations of extracts, and therefore even higher carvacrol concentration.
