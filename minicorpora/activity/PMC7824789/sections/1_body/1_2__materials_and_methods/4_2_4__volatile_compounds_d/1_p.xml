<p>Volatile compounds of summer savory (
 <italic>Satureja hortensis</italic> L.) samples were extracted using solid-phase microextraction (SPME). The SPME was performed in headspace of the sample in 10 mL glass bottles closed with screw caps with silica/Teflon septa using Stableflex fiber coated with 50/30 μm DVB/PDMS layer (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA). 0.025 g of herbal raw material samples were weighed for the extraction. Headspace extraction of the essential oil was carried out at 30 °C temperature for 10 min. The thermal desorption was carried out at 280 °C for 1 min. Automated SPME system was coupled with the chromatographic module. For determination of repeatability of results, extractions were repeated three times (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3).
