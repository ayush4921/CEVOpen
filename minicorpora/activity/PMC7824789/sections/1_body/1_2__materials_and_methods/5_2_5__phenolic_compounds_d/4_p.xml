<p>The content of total flavonoids was determined by AlCl
 <sub>3</sub> colorimetric method. A stock solution containing 60 mL of methanol (100%), 3 mL of acetic acid (33.0%), 12 mL of hexamethylenetetramine (5%), 9 mL of aluminum chloride (10%) and 60 mL of bidistilled water was prepared and stored in the refrigerator (4 °C). Total flavonoid content was determined mixing 80 μL of extract with 1920 μL of stock solution. After 30 min incubation at 4 °C the absorbance was measured at 407 nm. Results were calculated in rutin equivalents (RE mg/g).
