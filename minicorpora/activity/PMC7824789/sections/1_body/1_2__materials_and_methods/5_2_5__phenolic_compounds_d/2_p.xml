<p>Total phenolic content was determined using the Folin–Ciocalteu colorimetric method. An aqueous stock solution of 4% sodium carbonate (Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub>) was prepared and stored in refrigerator (4 °C). 100 μL of sample extract was added to 3000 μL of stock solution, mixed, and 100 μL 2 N Folin–Ciocalteu reagent was added. After 30 min incubating at room temperature the sample absorbance was measured at 760 nm. Results were calculated in rutin equivalents (RE mg/g).
