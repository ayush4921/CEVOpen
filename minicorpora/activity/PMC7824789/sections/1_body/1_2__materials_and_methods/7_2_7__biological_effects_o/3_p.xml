<p>To examine the effect of 
 <italic>S. hortensis</italic> L. extracts, skin cells were incubated for 24 h with extracts for 24 h under standard conditions in medium containing 12.5, 50, 75, and 100 µg/mL plant extract in 72% ethanol or were irradiated with UVB and then treated for 24 h with extract as above. The concentration of 
 <italic>S. hortensis</italic> L. extracts was chosen to correspond to 100% cell viability compared to control cells measured in the MTT assay [
 <xref rid="B32-antioxidants-10-00053" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The test uses the ability of active enzymes present in living and metabolically active cells to reducing the tetrazolium dye MTT 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide to its insoluble formazan. For this test, cells were seeded into a 96 well plate in 200 μL of growth media at 5 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> cells/well and after 24 h of growing subjected to UVB radiation or plant extracts. Following 24 h incubation culture medium was removed and MTT solution in PBS (0.25 mg/mL) was added to each well. The plate was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. All medium was removed from each well and 200 μL of DMSO was added to cells lysis. The level of formazan formed during incubation was read at 570 nm on a Multiskan GO Microplate Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and calculated as a percentage of results obtained for control sample.
