<p>Extracts V1, V2, and F1 at the concentrations used practically did not affect melanocytes survival, while extract F2 gradually reduced melanocytes survival to about 70% (for a concentration of 100 μg/mL). In contrast, extract F3 already at a concentration of 12.5 μg/mL reduced the survival of melanocytes to 60%, and at higher concentrations reduced it to about 50%. In contrast, V1, V2, and F1 extracts were also not toxic to melanoma cells, while F2 extract showed cytotoxicity from 50 μg/mL, and F3 from 12.5 μg/mL (
