0: Redox homeostasis of human body cells, including skin cells, is important for intracellular metabolism, which determines the proper functioning of the organism.
1: The redox balance depends on the amount of free radicals produced and the cells antioxidant capacity to counteract their cellular activity [ 23].
2: However, as a result of disorders of cell metabolism, as well as the action of environmental factors such as UV radiation, there is a disruption of cell redox balance and the development of disease states, including cancer [ 24].
3: This situation is usually accompanied by overproduction of highly reactive oxygen species (ROS), which act as short-term signaling molecules and stimulate the production of additional mediators, including lipid peroxidation products [ 25].
4: Lipid peroxidation products play an important causal role in the initiation and development of diseases [ 26].
5: Skin epidermis subtracts unique mixture of lipids (mainly ceramide, cholesterol, and other fatty acids) that forms natural permeability barrier.
6: Free radicals such as superoxide radicals, hydroxyl radicals, and singled oxygen disrupts the natural defense of the skin by reacting with skin lipids, which leaves skin exposed to negative environment.
7: Antioxidants such as polyphenolic compounds scavenge free radicals by inhibiting the initiation or propagation of oxidative chain reactions and can protect organism against serious diseases including cancer [ 27].
8: Essential oils of aromatic medical plants are the source of the bioactive compounds that may protect skin cells due to their anti-inflammatory, antibacterial and antioxidant properties [ 28].
