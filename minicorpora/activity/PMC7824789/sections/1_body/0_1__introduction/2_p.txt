0: Satureja hortensis L. is an annual herbaceous plant of Lamiaceae Lindl.
1: Family.
2: S. hortensis L., related to thyme and rosemary, is native to North Africa, Middle East, and Central Asia, Southern and Southeastern Europe.
3: Satureja species contain, in various concentrations, many phenolic and volatile components such as carvacrol, -terpinene, thymol, p-cymene, -arylene, linalool, and other terpenoids [ 5].
4: The mentioned compounds are synthesized mainly in plants in order to protect them against harmful environmental factors, including UV radiation contained in the sunlight.
5: However, the exact chemical composition depends on the Satureja species, as well as the location and the prevailing climate [ 6].
6: In Asia it is widely cultivated as a culinary herb.
7: Due to the attractive aroma, savory herbs, both dried and fermented, are used as flavoring substances and natural preservatives in food processing [ 7].
8: This plant is used as a traditional medicinal herb in Europe, and the medicinal plant raw material of savory is the aerial part of the plant Herba Satureae [ 8, 9].
9: This plant contains two main groups of biologically active compounds, namely phenolic compounds and essential oils [ 10, 11, 12, 13, 14].
10: Phenolic compounds exert multiple biological effects such as antioxidant, free radical scavenging and anti-inflammatory properties [ 15].
11: Due to accumulated compounds,  S. hortensis L. possess antioxidant, antibacterial, antispasmodic, antidiarrheic, hypoglycemic, and anti-hypercholesterolemic effects [ 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21].
12: However, environmental factors strongly influence the biosynthesis of polyphenols known as secondary metabolites of medicinal and aromatic plants, which means that the exact therapeutic activity of  S. hortensis L. depends on the place of origin [ 22].
