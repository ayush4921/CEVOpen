<p id="p0105">The effects of dietary supplementation with EEO on cecal microbial population are summarized in 
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The number of LAB in cecal digesta showed a linear increase trend with increasing dietary EEO supplementation (

 <italic>coli</italic> population (linear;
