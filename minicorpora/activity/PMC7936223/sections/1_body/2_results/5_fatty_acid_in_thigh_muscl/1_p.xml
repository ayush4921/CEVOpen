<p id="p0120">The effects of experimental treatments on fatty acid compositions in the thigh muscle of broiler chickens are presented in 
 <xref rid="tbl6" ref-type="table">TableÂ 6</xref>. The administration of EEO reduced concentrations of C14:0, C16:0, C18:0, and total saturated fatty acid (
 <bold>SFA</bold>) linearly, whereas increased contents of C18:2, C18:3, C20:4, and total polyunsaturated fatty acid (
 <bold>PUFA</bold>) linearly (P &lt; 0.05). However, no significant differences were found between the treatment groups for C20:0, C14:1, C16:1, C18:1, C20:1, and total monounsaturated fatty acid (
 <bold>MUFA</bold>) contents in the thigh muscle.
