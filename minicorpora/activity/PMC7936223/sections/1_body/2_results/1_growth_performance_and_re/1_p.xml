<p id="p0095">The data presented in 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> show the results of broiler chickens' growth performance in response to the dietary treatments. At the end of the starter period, no treatment effect was observed on BWG, FI, and FCR. Similar results were recorded between the dietary treatments for BWG and FI at the end of the growth period. However, in the same period, the inclusion of EEO to broiler diets linearly decreased (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) FCR compared with the CON diet. During the finisher phase, as well as the whole experimental period, the supplementation of EEO linearly increased (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) BWG but reduced (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) FCR without any effect on FI. The mortality rate was not influenced by dietary treatments during the study.
