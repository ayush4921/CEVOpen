<p id="p0070">The enumeration of bacterial target groups in the cecal was performed via bacteria culture, as described in our previous studies (
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Jazi et al., 2018a</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Jazi et al., 2018b</xref>). For this purpose, 1 g of cecal digesta contents was diluted serially in 0.9% sterile saline solution. Afterward, 100 μL of each dilution was plated onto MRS agar, tryptose sulfite cycloserine agar, eosin methylene blue agar, and MacConkey agar to enumerate the lactic acid bacteria (

 <italic>Clostridium</italic> spp., 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, and coliforms, respectively. Tryptose sulfite cycloserine agar and MRS agar plates were incubated anaerobically for 24 to 48 h at 37°C. The MacConkey agar and eosin methylene blue agar plates were incubated aerobically for 24 h at 37°C. After the incubation period, the bacterial colonies were counted in a colony counter, and the results were expressed as log
 <sub>10</sub> colony-forming units per gram of sample.
