<p id="p0045">The birds were randomly assigned into 5 dietary treatments, each replicated 8 times, with 15 chicks per replicate. The basal diets were formulated to meet or exceed 
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Aviagen (2019)</xref> recommendations, as is shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Before formulating the diets, the main feed ingredients (i.e., corn, soybean meal, and corn gluten meal) were analyzed for CP (method 955.04), ether extract (
 <bold>EE</bold>, method 920.39), crude fiber (method 962.09), and ash (method 942.05) according to the standard procedures of 
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">AOAC International (2000)</xref>. The dietary treatments consisted of a corn–soybean meal-based basal diet without any supplemental (as control, 
 <bold>CON</bold>) and basal diet with different EEO concentrations, including 250, 500, 750, and 1,000 mg/kg. To prepare dietary treatments, small amounts of the basal diet were mixed with the respective amount of each essential oil in small liquid batches and later on with a larger amount of basal diet until the total amount of the respective diet yielded a homogeneous mixture. The broiler chicks received the experimental diets in 3 phases from day 1 to 10 (starter), day 11 to 24 (grower), and day 25 to 42 (finisher). From day 35 to 42, chromic oxide (5 g/kg) was added to all diets as an indigestible marker to allow for the determination of AID of nutrients.
