<p id="p0040">A total of 600 1-day-old male chicks (Ross 308, Aviagen Inc., Huntsville, AL) were purchased from a commercial hatchery. On arrival, the chicks were weighed and randomly assigned to 40 floor pens. Each pen measured 1.35 m × 1.35 m and was equipped with a tube feeder and 2 cup drinkers with fresh wood shavings as bedding material. The ambient temperature was maintained at 33°C at the arrival of chicks for the initial 3 d and then reduced to 2.5°C per week until a temperature of 23°C was achieved. The lighting program and ventilation followed the recommendations of the Ross 308 breed management manual
