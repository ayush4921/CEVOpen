<p id="p0125">Pharmacological researches have shown that EEO has multiple biochemical and physiological functions in the body, owing to its active components, a variety of antioxidant phytochemicals, and bioactive ingredients (
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Arise et al., 2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Dhakad et al., 2018</xref>). However, there is a lack of data on the efficacy of EEO in broiler production. Therefore, the present study was attempted to assess the role of EEO as a natural growth promoter for broiler chickens. The results of the current study revealed that the inclusion of EEO in broiler diets linearly increased BWG and decreased FCR over the growth and overall periods. Recently, 
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Mashayekhi et al. (2018)</xref> reported that the addition of 0.5% eucalyptus powder in broiler diets improved BWG and reduced FCR over the growth and overall periods. 
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al. (2018)</xref> observed that the addition of 0.8 g/kg polyphenols in eucalyptus leaves to laying hen diets improved productive traits. Additionally, 
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Giannenas et al. (2003)</xref> reported significant improvements in BWG and FCR of broiler chickens fed diet containing oregano essential oil compared with the control group. Other studies also indicated that supplementation of broiler diet with 
 <italic>Pulicaria gnaphalodes</italic> powder (the main compound of the 
 <italic>Pulicaria gnaphalodes</italic> plant is 1.8-cineole, which is similar to eucalyptus) might potentially improve growth performance, antioxidant status, and fatty acid profile (
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Shirani et al., 2019</xref>). According to the literature, the positive influence of EEO on growth performance of broiler chickens could be attributed to EEO bioactive compounds ability in stimulating the digestive and pancreatic enzymes secretion (
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Hashemipour et al., 2013</xref>), improving gut morphology (
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Giannenas et al., 2018</xref>), and enhancing immune function (
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Chowdhury et al., 2018b</xref>). In addition, the appetite-stimulating properties and antimicrobial effects of herbs, spices, and various essential oils are likely to be other factors explaining increased growth performance (
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Windisch et al., 2008</xref>). On the other hand, according to the findings of the present study, the enhancement of growth performance observed in the current study could be because of increasing the antioxidant activities, improving the digestibility of nutrients, and maintaining the beneficial microbial population.
