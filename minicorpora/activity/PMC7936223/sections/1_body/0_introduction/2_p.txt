0: Among feed additives, the use of medicinal herb plants or phytogenic products (such as essential oils) in livestock nutrition has recently received much greater attention, owing to their important biological activities including antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory ( Windisch et al., 2008;  Brenes and Roura, 2010).
1: These features have been attributed to bioactive compounds (i.e., hydrocarbons, phenols, esters, alcohols, acids, and steroids) present in phytogenic products, which have positive effects on animal production and health ( Shirani et al., 2019).
2: Other characteristics of phytogenic feed additives include an increase in the production of digestive secretions such as endogenous digestive enzymes, saliva, bile, and mucin ( Brenes and Roura, 2010;  Sharma et al., 2020).
3: Therefore, phytogenic feed additives can influence animal productive and physiological responses, both quantitatively and qualitatively.
