0: This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of different dietary inclusion of eucalyptus essential oil (  EEO) on growth performance, relative organ weight, cecal microflora, nutrient digestibility, serum biochemical parameters, and thigh muscle fatty acid profile in broiler chickens.
1: A total of six hundred 1-day-old male broiler chickens were randomly allocated into 5 treatment groups with 8 replicate pens, and each pen contained 15 birds.
2: The experiment lasted for 42 d. Dietary treatments included cornsoybean meal-based diet supplemented with 0, 250, 500, 750, and 1,000 mg/kg EEO.
3: The results indicated that dietary treatments had no effect on growth performance parameters in the 1 to 10 d period.
4: From day 11 to 24, dietary supplementation of EEO showed a linear decrease in feed conversion ratio (  FCR,   P < 0.05).
5: From day 25 to 42 and the overall period (142 d), broilers fed with different levels of EEO showed a linear increase in body weight gain (  BWG) and reduction in feed conversion ratio (linear,   P < 0.05).
6: The relative organ weight were unaffected by any of the dietary treatments.
7: With increasing levels of EEO, the cecal   Escherichia coli (linear,   P = 0.085) count showed a trend in reduction, and the cecal lactic acid bacteria population tended to increase (linear,   P = 0.063).
8: The apparent ileal digestibility of ether extract and organic matter were linearly and quadratically increased in response to increasing dietary EEO supplementation (  P < 0.05).
9: A trend of linear decrease in total cholesterol in the serum of birds fed with different levels of EEO was recorded (  P = 0.074).
10: Eucalyptus essential oil's inclusion increased serum superoxide dismutase linearly but reduced serum malondialdehyde linearly (  P < 0.05).
11: Dietary supplementation of EEO affected the fatty acid profile of thigh muscle so that increased the concentrations of total polyunsaturated fatty acids (linear,   P < 0.05) and reduced total saturated fatty acid contents (linear,   P < 0.05).
12: Taken together, the inclusion of EEO increased BWG and decreased FCR during day 25 to 42 and day 1 to 42, and partially improved cecal microflora balance, nutrient digestibility, antioxidant activity, and thigh muscle fatty acid profile in broiler chickens.
