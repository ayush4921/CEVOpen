    "This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of different dietary inclusion of eucalyptus essential oil (EEO) on growth performance, relative organ weight, cecal microflora, nutrient digestibility, serum biochemical parameters, and thigh muscle fatty acid profile in broiler chickens. A total of six hundred 1-day-old male broiler chickens were randomly allocated into 5 treatment groups with 8 replicate pens, and each pen contained 15 birds. The experiment lasted for 42 d. Dietary treatments included corn-soybean meal-based diet supplemented with 0, 250, 500, 750, and 1,000 mg/kg EEO. The results indicated that dietary treatments had no effect on growth performance parameters in the 1 to 10 d period. From day 11 to 24, dietary supplementation of EEO showed a linear decrease in feed conversion ratio (FCR, P < 0.05). From day 25 to 42 and the overall period (1-42 d), broilers fed with different levels of EEO showed a linear increase in body weight gain (BWG) and reduction in feed conversion ratio (linear, P < 0.05). The relative organ weight were unaffected by any of the dietary treatments. With increasing levels of EEO, the cecal Escherichia coli (linear, P = 0.085) count showed a trend in reduction, and the cecal lactic acid bacteria population tended to increase (linear, P = 0.063). The apparent ileal digestibility of ether extract and organic matter were linearly and quadratically increased in response to increasing dietary EEO supplementation (P < 0.05). A trend of linear decrease in total cholesterol in the serum of birds fed with different levels of EEO was recorded (P = 0.074). Eucalyptus essential oil's inclusion increased serum superoxide dismutase linearly but reduced serum malondialdehyde linearly (P < 0.05). Dietary supplementation of EEO affected the fatty acid profile of thigh muscle so that increased the concentrations of total polyunsaturated fatty acids (linear, P < 0.05) and reduced total saturated fatty acid contents (linear, P < 0.05). Taken together, the inclusion of EEO increased BWG and decreased FCR during day 25 to 42 and day 1 to 42, and partially improved cecal microflora balance, nutrient digestibility, antioxidant activity, and thigh muscle fatty acid profile in broiler chickens."
