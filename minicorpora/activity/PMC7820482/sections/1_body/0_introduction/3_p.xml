<p id="p0015">The main components of EOs are complex mixtures of hydrocarbon terpenes and terpenoids (
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">El Asbahani et al., 2015</xref>). The majority of the first group consists of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, and the second group consists of oxygenated derivatives of hydrocarbon terpenes. Studies about volatile constituents of 
 <italic>M. verticillata</italic> from various phytogeographic areas of Argentina revealed that there is a high genetic diversity in this species, which appears to be divided into three chemotypes: carvone, thymol-carvacrol and pulegone-menthone (
 <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Zygadlo et al., 1996</xref>). Testing the EO chemical composition is fundamental because several biological activities are attributed to the EO compounds (
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">León-Méndez et al., 2019</xref>). Recent studies on 
 <italic>M. verticillata</italic> EO (pulegone-menthone chemotype) have revealed 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antimicrobial and anti-biofilm properties on 
 <italic>Streptococcus uberis</italic>, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecium</italic> and 
 <italic>Bacillus pumilus</italic> strains isolated from cows with mastitis (

 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Cerioli et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, 
 <italic>M. verticillata</italic> EO has also demonstrated immunomodulatory effects by decreasing pro-inflammatory mediators as histamine and β-hexosaminidase or pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β) and increasing anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10) both 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and in experimental mouse models (

 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Montironi et al., 2019</xref>). However, the limitations in the use and application of EOs are mainly attributed to their photosensitive, volatile, and hydrophobic nature, which has stimulated the search for new conservation systems to exploit their great potential. For this purpose, a large number of encapsulation methods have been developed in recent years. These methods include film hydration (
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Asprea et al., 2017</xref>), coacervation (
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Gonçalves et al., 2017</xref>), spray drying (
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Herculano et al., 2015</xref>), ionic gelation (
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Noppakundilograt et al., 2015</xref>), complexation (
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Da Rocha Neto et al., 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Shrestha et al., 2017</xref>), liposomes (
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Cui et al., 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2019</xref>), chitosan nanoparticles embedded gelatin nanofibers (
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Cui et al., 2018</xref>) and nanoemulsions (
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Lou et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al., 2013</xref>). The encapsulation of EO in a nanoemulsion (NE) is a promising strategy to facilitate its applicability and enhance its properties. These formulations offer numerous advantages including a controlled small droplet size which are kinetically stabilized against aggregation and gravitational separation (
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Donsí and Ferrari, 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Qian and McClements, 2011</xref>). Additionally, NEs have a larger surface area of active ingredients compared to conventional emulsions and, therefore, the functionality is enhanced when they interact with biological systems, improving the diffusion and biological efficacy of dispersed bioactive agents (
 <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Salvia-trujillo et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bajerski et al., 2016</xref>). NEs have been extensively exploited in many fields, including the pharmaceutical field, due to their medicinal properties. Several EO formulations were tested against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Donsí and Ferrari, 2016</xref>). However, to the best of our knowledge there are no reports about 
 <italic>M. verticillata</italic> EO based NE and their antibacterial effect. The present study aimed to characterize 
 <italic>M. verticillata</italic> EO nanoemulsions and evaluate its antibacterial activity against a 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> strain (ATCC, 209213) when compared with that of the pure EO.
