0: The main components of EOs are complex mixtures of hydrocarbon terpenes and terpenoids ( El Asbahani et al., 2015).
1: The majority of the first group consists of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, and the second group consists of oxygenated derivatives of hydrocarbon terpenes.
2: Studies about volatile constituents of  M. verticillata from various phytogeographic areas of Argentina revealed that there is a high genetic diversity in this species, which appears to be divided into three chemotypes: carvone, thymol-carvacrol and pulegone-menthone ( Zygadlo et al., 1996).
3: Testing the EO chemical composition is fundamental because several biological activities are attributed to the EO compounds ( Leon-Mendez et al., 2019).
4: Recent studies on  M. verticillata EO (pulegone-menthone chemotype) have revealed  in vitro antimicrobial and anti-biofilm properties on  Streptococcus uberis,  Escherichia coli,  Enterococcus faecium and  Bacillus pumilus strains isolated from cows with mastitis ( Montironi et al., 2016;  Cerioli et al., 2018).
5: In addition,  M. verticillata EO has also demonstrated immunomodulatory effects by decreasing pro-inflammatory mediators as histamine and -hexosaminidase or pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-, IL-1) and increasing anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10) both  in vitro and in experimental mouse models ( Cariddi et al., 2011;  Montironi et al., 2019).
6: However, the limitations in the use and application of EOs are mainly attributed to their photosensitive, volatile, and hydrophobic nature, which has stimulated the search for new conservation systems to exploit their great potential.
7: For this purpose, a large number of encapsulation methods have been developed in recent years.
8: These methods include film hydration ( Asprea et al., 2017), coacervation ( Goncalves et al., 2017), spray drying ( Herculano et al., 2015), ionic gelation ( Noppakundilograt et al., 2015), complexation ( Da Rocha Neto et al., 2018;  Shrestha et al., 2017), liposomes ( Cui et al., 2020;  Lin et al., 2019), chitosan nanoparticles embedded gelatin nanofibers ( Cui et al., 2018) and nanoemulsions ( Lou et al., 2017;  Chang et al., 2013).
9: The encapsulation of EO in a nanoemulsion (NE) is a promising strategy to facilitate its applicability and enhance its properties.
10: These formulations offer numerous advantages including a controlled small droplet size which are kinetically stabilized against aggregation and gravitational separation ( Donsi and Ferrari, 2016;  Qian and McClements, 2011).
11: Additionally, NEs have a larger surface area of active ingredients compared to conventional emulsions and, therefore, the functionality is enhanced when they interact with biological systems, improving the diffusion and biological efficacy of dispersed bioactive agents ( Salvia-trujillo et al., 2013;  Bajerski et al., 2016).
12: NEs have been extensively exploited in many fields, including the pharmaceutical field, due to their medicinal properties.
13: Several EO formulations were tested against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria ( Donsi and Ferrari, 2016).
14: However, to the best of our knowledge there are no reports about  M. verticillata EO based NE and their antibacterial effect.
15: The present study aimed to characterize  M. verticillata EO nanoemulsions and evaluate its antibacterial activity against a  Staphylococcus aureus strain (ATCC, 209213) when compared with that of the pure EO.
