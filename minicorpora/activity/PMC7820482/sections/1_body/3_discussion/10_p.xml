<p id="p0175">Safety is an important concern in the use of novel products such as NE. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> erythrocyte-induced hemolysis can be considered a simple and reliable measure for estimating the membrane damage caused 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> (
 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Pape and Hoppe, 1990</xref>). The behavior of 
 <italic>M. verticillata</italic> EO based NE was studied by investigating the degree of hemolysis 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. No hemolytic activity on both porcine and equine blood was detected by any of NE concentrations evaluated. The NE toxicity is highly dependent on the chemical composition of the used oil (

 <italic>M. verticillata</italic> EO has been demonstrated 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> on Vero and Hep-2 cells (

 <italic>M. verticillata</italic> EO by different routes in experimental animals has also proven to be safe and it does not exert a cyto-genotoxic effect on the bone marrow and blood cells (
