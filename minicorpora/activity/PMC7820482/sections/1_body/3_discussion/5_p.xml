<p id="p0150">In the present study, NE was synthesized by ultrasonic emulsification, a high-energy method that rapidly and efficiently produces NEs with small droplet diameters (

 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Ghosh et al., 2013</xref>). The physical-chemical characterization of NE revealed that the different formulations presented similar pH, but the transmittance percentage and stability increased significantly with the enhancements of surfactant content. Scanning electron microscopy allowed establishing the average diameter of droplets, in around 10 nm, leading to the formation of a more homogeneous structure. 
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Ghosh et al. (2014)</xref>, obtained similar results with eugenol-loaded nanoemulsions using a non-ionic surfactant (tween 80). Previous studies revealed that nanoemulsions that minimize droplet size have a more homogeneous structure that leads to higher stability (

 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Bruxel et al. (2012)</xref>, the use of nonionic surfactants from the group of poloxamer and polyoxyethylene sorbitans (tweens) has shown a favorable association with phospholipids, as they lead to the formation of compact mixed films, conferring greater stability to the formulation.
