<p id="p0170">A killing kinetics assay was performed to establish changes in the viability of 
 <italic>S</italic>. aureus upon interaction with pure EO or NE over 24 h. A reduction of 1.28 log CFU/mL was observed after 3 h interaction of NE with the bacteria. The greatest effect was found after 24 h with NE (450 mg/mL, equivalent to 27 mg/mL of EO) reaching a reduction of approximately 5 Log CFU/mL. 
 <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Sugumar et al. (2014)</xref> studied the antibacterial activity of eucalyptus oil nanoemulsion (undiluted) against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and obtained a complete loss of viability within 15 min of interaction. The antibacterial activity results founded in the present work clearly shows that the NE was more effective at inactivating the bacteria than pure EO. These results were in agreement with other studies that showed that the conversion of an EO (
 <italic>T. daenensis</italic>) into a NE greatly enhanced its antibacterial activity against an important food-borne pathogenic bacterium (
 <italic>E. coli</italic>) (

 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Bhargava et al., 2015</xref>). The superior antimicrobial effect of NE can be explained by an increase in surface area that improves the efficacy of EO as it ensures larger contact with bacteria cells. 
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Donsì et al. (2011)</xref> have shown that nanoemulsion-based delivery systems of d-limonene and a terpenes mixture significantly increased the antimicrobial activity of encapsulated compounds in comparison to non-encapsulated ones. This is probably because the small lipid particles inside the NE are capable of transport the EO towards the surface of the cell membranes, suggesting that the pure oil (which has little solubility) could not easily interact with the membranes (
