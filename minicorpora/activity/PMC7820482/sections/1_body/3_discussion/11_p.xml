<p id="p0180">Our results suggest that a nanoemulsion containing 
 <italic>M. verticillata</italic> EO may be a promising and safe formulation for 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> control, which also supports the idea that nanoformulations based on natural products can be considered an alternative as potential antimicrobial agents. Additional studies are necessary and ongoing to study the antimicrobial efficacy of NE against another bacterial pathogens and to reveal the mechanism of action of nanoencapsulated 
 <italic>M. verticillata</italic> EO against these microorganisms.
