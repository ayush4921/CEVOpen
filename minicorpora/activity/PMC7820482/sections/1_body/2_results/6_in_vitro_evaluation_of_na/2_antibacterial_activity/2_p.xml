<p id="p0120">The antibacterial activity after the incubation for 24 h of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> with the different concentration of EO and NE was evaluated. The average percentage of bacterial growth inhibition of the highest concentration tested of both the EO (27 mg/mL) and the NE (450 mg/mL = 27 mg/mL of EO) was 46.72% ± 3.32 and 58.87% ± 0.99, respectively. A dose-dependent effect was not observed between all the concentrations of NE evaluated; however, a clear statistical significant difference was observed between the highest and lowest (50 mg/mL = 3 mg/mL of EO) NE concentrations. All the NE concentrations tested showed a stronger growth inhibition with statistical significant difference when compared to the same concentration of pure EO. No dose-dependent effect was observed between the concentrations of EO (
