<p id="p0115">Release profile assay was carried out using 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> dialysis experiment. As can be seen in 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, after 3 h, the release of EO was 29.48 ± 0.96%. However, a sustained release of EO from the NE was observed during the first 6 h, in which more than 55% of EO was found to be released (58.75 ± 1.75). At the end of 24 h of experiment, 74.24 ± 0.75% of EO was released from NE.
