<p id="p0075">Antibacterial activity assay was conducted in 96-wells plates. Briefly, 10 μL of the initial inoculum standardized at 1 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/mL and 90 μL of the stock solutions of EO and NE (corresponding to the different concentrations) were added to each well. Then, all the wells were filled with 100 μL of fresh TSB for a final volume of 200 μL per well with a bacteria concentration of 1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU/mL in the wells. Growth control wells contained 10 μL of inoculum and 190 μL of TSB. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h.
