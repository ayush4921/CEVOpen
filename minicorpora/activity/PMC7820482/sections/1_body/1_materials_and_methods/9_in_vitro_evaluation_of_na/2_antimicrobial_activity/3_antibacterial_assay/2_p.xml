<p id="p0070">In order to compare antibacterial activity, it was important to make sure that the concentrations of EO used both pure and encapsulated in the NE, were the same. Five concentrations of EO were chosen to be tested: 3, 9, 15, 21, and 27 mg/mL. Then, dilutions of the NE that would contain equal concentrations of EO mentioned above were calculated based on the density of the EO (950 mg/mL) and its ratio in the NE formulation (6%). The concentrations obtained were 50, 150, 250, 350 and 450 mg/mL of NE, which corresponded to 3, 9, 15, 21 and 27 mg/mL of EO encapsulated in the NE, respectively. In all cases, stock solutions of each concentration of EO and NE were prepared immediately before been used, diluted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS).</p>
