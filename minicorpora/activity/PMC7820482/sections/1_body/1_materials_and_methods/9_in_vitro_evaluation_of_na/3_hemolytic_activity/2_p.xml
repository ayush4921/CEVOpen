<p id="p0085">Bovine and equine peripheral blood samples were freshly collected and put into a test tube containing an anticoagulant (EDTA-Na
 <sub>2</sub> 10%). For the quantification of hemolytic activity, same concentrations of NE used in the previous assay were tested (50, 150, 250, 350 and 450 mg/mL). Aliquots of 50 μL of blood were mixed with the different solutions of NE; the tubes were homogenized and incubated for 60 min at room temperature. The samples were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatant was removed to measure the absorbance (540 nm) corrected with the blank (buffered solution containing red blood cells). The results were compared with a positive control in which the cells were completely lysed by distilled water. Experiments were carried out in triplicate. The hemolytic activity of each sample was calculated by the following equation:
 <disp-formula id="fd2">
  <label>(2)</label>Hemolysis (%) = (DO sample - DO control (-)) / (DO control (+) - DO control (-)) × 100
 </disp-formula>
