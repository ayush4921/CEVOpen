<p id="p0030">Nanoemulsions (NE) consisted of 
 <italic>M. verticillata</italic> EO, Tween 20 as a surfactant and deionized water were synthesized as 
 <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Rodrigues et al. (2014)</xref> with some modifications. The essential oil and Tween 20 were stirred at 800 rpm using a magnetic stirrer for 30 min. Then, water was added dropwise at a flow rate of 2 mL/min. The mixture was stirred at 800 rpm for 30 min. Final homogenization was achieved using a Heidolph DIAX 900 homogenizer (Germany) equipped with a 10 G disperser for 5 min (8000 rpm). Formulation variable was oil/surfactant ratio (1:1, 1:2, 1:3 and 1:4). EO percentage was 6% for all formulations.
