<p id="p0025">The essential oil recovered was analyzed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) using a gas chromatograph Clarus 600 (Perkin Elmer) equipped with DB5 column. Gas chromatographic (GC) conditions were as follows: injector temperature, 260 °C; flame ionization detection temperature, 240 °C; carrier gas, Helium; flow rate, 1 mL/min; and split injection with split ratio 1:40. The oven temperature was initially 60 °C and was increased to 240 °C at a rate of 5ºC/min. One microliter of each sample, dissolved in hexane (1:100 mg/μL), was injected into a DB-5 column (0.25 mm I. D, 60 m in length, and 0.25 μm film thickness). The chromatogram was obtained in “scan” mode, from m/z = 30 am/z = 450 (scan time: 0.2 s, inter-scan time: 0.1s), solvent delay: 5 min. Data were acquired using TurboMass 5.4.2 software. The identification of the peaks was made by comparison with the mass spectra of the components found with that of the NIST MS Search 2.0 program libraries. To confirm the identity of the compounds, pure compounds (standard grade) were injected under the same chromatographic conditions. Retention rates were calculated by analyzing a C8–C20 alkane standard (Fluka cod 101385968) under the same conditions as the sample (
