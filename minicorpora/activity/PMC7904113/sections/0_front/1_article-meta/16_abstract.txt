0: Essential oils (EOs) have been utilized as a growth inhibitor of microorganisms.
1: This study was aimed to recognize the composition, antioxidative, antibacterial, and time-kill activities of   Origanum vulgare,   Zataria multiflora,   Syzygium aromaticum; and   Cinnamomum verum EOs against   Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli O157:H7,   Shewanellaputrefaciens and   Pseudomonas fluorescens.
2: Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to determine the chemical composition of EOs.
3: Disc diffusion, minimum inhibitory concentration, minimum bactericidal concentration, and time-kill methods were used to determine the antibacterial activity of EOs.
4: The antioxidative  activity of EOs were determined by 2, 20-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging and ferric reducing antioxidative  power methods.
5: All EOs exhibited antibacterial activity, however,   Z. multiflora EO was the most effective followed by   O. vulgare EO  .
6: The lowest antibacterial activity was observed in   C. verum EO.
7: The most sensitive among tested bacteria to   Z. multiflora and   O. vulgare EOs was   E. coli O157:H7 and to   S. aromaticum; and   C. verum EOs were   S. putrefaciens and   P. fluorescens, respectively  .Z.
8: multiflora and   O. vulgare EOs were able to kill 85.00% and 80.00% of the   E. coli O157: H7 and   S.putrefaciens cells in 4 hr, respectively.
9: The highest antioxidative activity was observed in   Z. multiflora EO.
10: The tested EOs showed the highest antioxidative activity at a concentration of 2.00 g L  -1.
11: Ferric reducing antioxidant power value of   Z. multiflora, O. vulgare,   S. aromaticum and   C. verum was 2.01  0.03, 1.47  0.04, 1.01  0.03, and 0.66  0.34, respectively.
12: High concentrations of tested EOs showed a decrease in antioxidative  activity.
