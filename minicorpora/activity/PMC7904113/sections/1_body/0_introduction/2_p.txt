0: This study was aimed to (1) identify chemical compositions of OEO , ZEO , CEO; and SEO by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), (2) study the antibacterial activity of these EOs using agar disc diffusion and broth microdilution assay as well as kill-time assay against  L. monocytogenes, E. coli O157:H7 and SSOs including  S. putrefaciens and  P. fluorescens; and (3) measure antioxidative  capacities of tested EOs using outcomes of 2,20-dipheny-l-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays.
