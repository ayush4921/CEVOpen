<p>This study was aimed to (1) identify chemical compositions of OEO
 <italic>, </italic>ZEO
 <italic>, </italic>CEO; and SEO by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), (2) study the antibacterial ‎‎activity of these EOs using agar disc diffusion and broth microdilution assay as well as kill-time assay against 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes, E. coli </italic>O157:H7 and SSOs including 
 <italic>S. putrefaciens </italic>and 
 <italic>P. fluorescens</italic>; and (3) measure antioxidative ‎ capacities of tested EOs using outcomes of 2,20-dipheny-l-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays.
