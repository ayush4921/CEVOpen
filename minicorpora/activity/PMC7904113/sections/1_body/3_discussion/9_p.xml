<p>The studied EOs were capable of chelating iron (II). The ZEO had the highest FRAP value followed by OEO. All of the EOs showed interesting antioxidative ‎ activities. The standard anti-oxidant (BHT) had a higher FRAP value than natural anti-oxidant and the best reducing abilities. The outcomes showed that ZEO and OEO have good reductive power and may thus possess significant antioxidative ‎ activity. The FRAP of EOs revealed that EOs had lower FRAP values than the reference anti-oxidant.

 </sup> The SEO showed a higher FRAP value than that of the CEO. High concentrations of tested EOs showed a decrease in antioxidative ‎ activity.
