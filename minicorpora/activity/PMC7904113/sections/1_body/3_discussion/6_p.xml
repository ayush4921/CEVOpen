 </sup> only a few EOs were described for their antibacterial ‎‎activities. This section of the study aimed to define the antibacterial‎‎‎‎‎ effects of two EOs using the ELISA reader method. The two EOs (ZEO and OEO) decreased the number of an organism after 4 hr, but ZEO indicated consistent antibacterial‎‎‎‎‎ activity more than OEO.
