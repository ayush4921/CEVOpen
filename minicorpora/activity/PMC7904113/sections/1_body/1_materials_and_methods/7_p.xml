 </sup> with modifications. From the wells showed inhibition of microorganisms in the MIC test, aliquots of 10.00 μL were collected, transferred to MHA medium, and incubated at 37.00 ˚C for 24 hr and less than five colonies were considered as MBC as they signify kill ratio of over 99.97%. Amikacin (Sigma-Aldrich) in the range of 0.03 - 64.00 μg mL
 <sup>-1</sup> was utilized as a control. In cases where there was no bacterial growth in the culture medium, it can be observed that the tested EOs showed bactericidal effects, but not bacteriostatic ones.
