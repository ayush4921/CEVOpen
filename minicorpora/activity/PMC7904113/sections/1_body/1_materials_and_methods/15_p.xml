<p>The procedure for preparation of the calibration curve was as follows: Buffer concentrate 1:10 was assayed by the addition of one portion of the concentrate to nine portions of distilled water. Standards were prepared with labeling test tubes from 1.00 to 6.180 μL of diluted assay buffer being added to tube 1 and 100 μL of diluted assay buffer being poured into the rest of the tubes. Twenty μL of the ferrous chloride standard stock was carefully added to tube 1 and vortex. One hundred μL of the solution from tube 1 was poured into tube 2 and vortex completely. The serial dilutions were repeated for tubes 3 through 6. The level of ferrous chloride in tubes 1 to 6 was 1000, 500, 250, 125, 62.50; and 31.25 μM FeCl
 <sub>2</sub>, respectively. The BHT was utilized as a positive control (0.50 - 3.00 g L
 <sup>-1</sup>). Experiments were carried out in triplicate. The graph was plotted with the average of three determinations. The resulting mixture was vigorously shaken and then incubated at 37.00 ˚C for 4 min and the increase in absorbance at 593 nm was determined and compared with the standard absorbance (
 <italic>A</italic>) readings taken at 593 nm. The 4-min readings were chosen for the calculation of FRAP values.
