 <bold>Determination of MIC.</bold> Antibacterial‎‎ efficiency of EOs was quantified by the MIC method (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). All tested bacterial strains were susceptible to four EOs. The MIC of four EOs for all of the tested bacteria was in the range of 0.64 - 40.96 mg mL
 <sup>-1</sup>. The ZEO showed strong antibacterial ‎ ‎‎activities at MIC ≤ 1.28 mg mL
 <sup>-1</sup>. The MIC of ZEO for all of the bacteria was minimized. The bacterial growth was also inhibited by OEO at MIC ≤ 2.56 mg mL
 <sup>-1</sup>. There were no differences between the antibacterial ‎ ‎‎activity of ZEO and OEO (
