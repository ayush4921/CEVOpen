 <bold> activity. </bold>The EOs exhibited anti-oxidative ‎ effects and inhibition of DPPH as the percentage increased with an increasing amount of EOs concentration (0.01 - 20.00 mg mL
 <sup>-1</sup>), which was compared with BHT, used as a standard at the concentration of 0.01 - 20.00 mg mL
 <sup>-1</sup>. Inhibitions of DPPH as percentage in 0.01 - 20 mg mL
 <sup>-1</sup> EOs concentration for ZEO, SEO, OEO, and CEO were respectively 9.00-97.00%, 4.00-92.00%, 6.00-95.00%, and 0.50-80.00% but for BHT were 10.00 - 98.00%. According to the results, ZEO exhibited the strongest inhibition of DPPH (97.00%). This activity was followed by OEO95.00%) and SEO (92.00%). The CEO had the lowest DPPH free-radical scavenging activity (80.00%). The specimen level providing 50.00% inhibition (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) was computed from the graph corresponding to the inhibition percentage versus specimen concentration. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> of BHT, OEO, SEO, ZEO, and CEO was 0.10 ± 0.00, 0.14 ± 0.03, 0.16 ± 0.03, 0.13 ± 0.04 and 6.00 ± 0.02 mg mL
 <sup>-1</sup>, respectively.
