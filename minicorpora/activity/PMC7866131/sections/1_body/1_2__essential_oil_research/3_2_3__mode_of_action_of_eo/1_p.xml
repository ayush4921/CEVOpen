<p>EO chemical compounds possess different modes of action that can be used to inhibit or kill microbes (

 <xref rid="B23-molecules-26-00628" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The mode of action of each EO compound may differ, as some act on the outer membrane of bacteria and some act on the membrane proteinsâ€™ efflux system. The hydrophobicity of EO enables them to penetrate the cell wall of bacteria, which subsequently disrupts the cell wall, causing increased permeability and the release of intracellular materials [
