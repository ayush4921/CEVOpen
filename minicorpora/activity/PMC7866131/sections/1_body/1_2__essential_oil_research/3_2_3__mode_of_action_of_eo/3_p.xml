<p>Bacterial cell membranes are composed of phospholipids and proteins. After the bacteria had been exposed to CBO, some proteins were lost from the outer membrane and some were lost from the plasma membrane of the bacteria [
 <xref rid="B75-molecules-26-00628" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. These proteins that were lost play a role in energy generation; losing these proteins may disrupt the bacterial cell membrane and subsequent killing of the bacteria [

 <xref rid="B121-molecules-26-00628" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>,
 <xref rid="B122-molecules-26-00628" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. In fact, LVO and meropenem, in addition with reactive oxygen species (ROS), have resulted in bacterial membrane disruption.
