Rosemary EO was tested against human tumor cells including SK-OV-3, HO-8910, and Bel-7402; it was shown to have a variety of activities, based on the MTT or 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. The EO was shown to possess antiproliferative cellular activity. The antioxidant activity was also assessed by measuring the inhibition of peroxidation percentage by the disc diffusion and resazurin plate assays. The results show that rosemary EO possesses antiproliferative, antioxidant activity, and antibacterial activity against different microorganisms tested [
