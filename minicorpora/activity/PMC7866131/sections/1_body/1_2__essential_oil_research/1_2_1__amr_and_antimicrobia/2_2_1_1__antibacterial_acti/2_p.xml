<p>In addition, it was determined that citronellol and carveol had a strong inhibitory effect over the growth of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> because these EO can interact with the cell wall components such as the membrane proteins, which will lead to disturbance in cell wall integrity [

This is explained by the outer structure of Gram-positive bacteria, which contains a thick peptidoglycan cell wall that allows penetration by hydrophobic compounds.
