<p>Some EO compounds have shown an effective response against viruses through viricidal activity, preventing the viral replication and adsorption of viruses to host cells [

 <italic>Zataria multiflora, Eucalyptus caesia, Artemisia kermanensis, Satureja hortensis L</italic>., and rosemary against herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) using the plaque reduction assay [
 <xref rid="B100-molecules-26-00628" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. However, thymus EO was tested against HSV and influenza and showed no effective results [

In a different study, the β-caryophyllene, which is constituent in many EO, has been examined for its viricidal activity against dengue virus (DENV) proteins, and effective results were reported as it acted on inhibiting the replication of the DENV [

 <xref rid="B103-molecules-26-00628" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. Compounds such as γ-terpinene and cuminyl-aldehyde have been found to have antiviral activity against two types of viruses; a significant inhibition was observed on HSV-1 (DNA virus), while a lesser inhibitory effect was observed on the parainfluenza virus type 3 (PI-3) (RNA virus) [
