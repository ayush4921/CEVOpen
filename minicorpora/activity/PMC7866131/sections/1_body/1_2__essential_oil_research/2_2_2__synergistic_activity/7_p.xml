<p>The antifungal effect of 
 <italic>Pelargonium graveolens</italic> has also been tested in combination with fluconazole on 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> strains using the micro-broth dilution assay. The results suggest the synergistic reaction when combining 
 <italic>P. graveolens</italic> with fluconazole with an FIC of 0.37, which shows that 
 <italic>P. graveolens</italic> can enhance the efficiency of fluconazole treatment by 78.31% [

 <italic>Melissa officinalis</italic> EO has been examined against avian influenza virus (AVI) [
 <xref rid="B117-molecules-26-00628" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. The combination of 
 <italic>M. officinalis</italic> EO and oseltamivir antiviral drug showed synergistic activity as the results showed a reduction in the viral genome copy number, which proves the inhibitory effect against AVI [
