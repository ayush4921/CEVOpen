<p>In a study, a combination of five EOs with seven antibiotics have been investigated; the combined effect of peppermint, cinnamon bark, and lavender EO with piperacillin, peppermint, and meropenem showed significant synergistic effects against various 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> strains [

 <xref rid="B107-molecules-26-00628" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>,
 <xref rid="B108-molecules-26-00628" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. In a different study, the fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) of EO was evaluated, and the data showed promising outcome against fungal and bacterial species [

 <xref rid="B110-molecules-26-00628" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. Hence, when more than one EO were combined, a greater efficacy was achieved. Oregano and thyme EO combined showed synergistic effects against different fungal species studied with FIC ≤0.5, except for 
 <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic>, which that displayed an additive effect with an FIC value of 0.75 ± 0.16. Moreover, a synergistic effect was found between carvacrol and thymol, which are compounds contained in thyme and oregano, respectively, to have a synergistic effect against 
 <italic>Penicillium spp</italic>, 
 <italic>A. flavus,</italic> and 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> species with FIC ≤ 0.5. A synergistic effect was also reported between carvacrol and thyme EO that showed an enhanced effectiveness against 
 <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> [
