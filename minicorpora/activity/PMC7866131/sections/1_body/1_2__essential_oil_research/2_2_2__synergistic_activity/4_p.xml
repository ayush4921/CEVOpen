<p>EO from 
 <italic>Salvia fruticosa, Salvia officinalis</italic>, and 
 <italic>Salvia sclarea</italic> were investigated using five 
 <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> strains that possess the 
 <italic>Tet(K)</italic> efflux pump, which is involved in the tetracycline resistance mechanism [
 <xref rid="B113-molecules-26-00628" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. The checkerboard method was used to evaluate the combined effect of the EO and tetracycline. Using quantitative RT-PCR, the largest decline of the tetracycline effluxes was detected from 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> cells treated with 
 <italic>S. fruticosa</italic> EO. The mRNA level of 
 <italic>Tet(K)</italic> gene was lowered by 2·2-fold, which indicated efflux pump inhibition. Findings demonstrated the synergistic potential of 
 <italic>Salvias’</italic> EO combined with tetracycline, with lowered MICs values showing 
 <italic>S. fruticosa</italic> EO to be the most effective of the three EO tested [
