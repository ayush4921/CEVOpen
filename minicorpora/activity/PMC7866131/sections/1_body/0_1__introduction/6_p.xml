<p>The role of EO is mainly in plant protection; apart from providing antimicrobial activities, they also provide protection against insects and herbivores [

According to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (2005), EO can be used safely, and its components can be used as additives in antimicrobial drugs to reduce the development of resistance against antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral drugs [

 <xref rid="B41-molecules-26-00628" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Owing to the presence of various compounds, these EO have antimicrobial potential. This review summarizes EO effectivity on microorganisms and aims to extensively focus on the effectiveness of EO and their compounds against various microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Moreover, we will discuss the potential of various EOs in inhibiting microbial growth in addition to identifying the mode of action of EO and synergistic activity. Finally, the genomic perspective of EO against bacteria and the proteomic technologies used to study the bacterial proteome when treated with EO will be discussed.
