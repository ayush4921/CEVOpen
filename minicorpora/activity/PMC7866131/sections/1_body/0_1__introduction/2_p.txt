0: Bacterial resistance to antibiotics can either be inherited or acquired via resistant genes [ 14].
1: Vertical gene transfer occurs from a parent cell while horizontal gene transfer of plasmids is acquired from other cells; the acquisition can also be due to a spontaneous recombination [ 9, 15, 16].
2: Due to the acquisition of these genes, bacteria are able to produce enzymes such as -lactamase, carbapenemase, and nucleotidyltransferase (NTase) that act against the antibiotics, on the efflux pump on the bacterial cell membrane, or change the original target site of the antibiotic [ 17].
3: Fungi can also develop antifungal resistance.
4: For example,  Candida, an opportunistic yeast, can develop resistance to drugs when an antibacterial drug is consumed by the host.
5: Despite the drug not being targeted to  Candida, prolonged exposure can introduce  Candida resistance to the drug [ 18].
6: Both  Aspergillus and  Candida species have shown resistance to antifungal drugs such as azole and fluconazole, which can be used to treat systemic fungal infections by inhibiting its growth [ 19, 20].
7: Viruses have also shown antiviral resistance; for example, influenza virus has shown resistance against Oseltamivir, Amantadine, and Rimantadine.
8: Resistance to Acyclovir by herpes simplex virus (HSV) has been detected in different countries [ 21].
