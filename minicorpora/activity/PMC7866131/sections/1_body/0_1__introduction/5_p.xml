<p>Among the main components of EO are two distinctive chemical groups of bio-synthetic origin: terpenes and terpenoids. These compounds are usually responsible for antimicrobial action against disease-causing bacteria [

 <xref rid="B38-molecules-26-00628" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], with most of the common or medicinally important terpenes being monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. Monoterpenes are found in about 90% of EO. These EO have a broad spectrum activity against bacterial infections due to their high content of oxygenated monoterpenes [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-26-00628" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Terpenes are the hydrocarbons that consist of isoprene units with the general formula (C
 <sub>5</sub>H
 <sub>8</sub>)
 <sub>n</sub> joined together by the head to tail ruleâ€”this meaning the fourth carbon atom of a single unit bonds with the first carbon atom of another unit to form a 1-4 linkage.
