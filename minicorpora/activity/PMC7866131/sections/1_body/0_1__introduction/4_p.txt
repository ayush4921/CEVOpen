0: Compounds with functional groups in the EO were found to play a role in their reactivity against pathogenic microorganisms [ 23].
1: Therefore, the use of EO was taken as a new direction to treat microbial infections due to their antimicrobial, antifungal, and antiviral properties [ 24].
2: EO contain mixtures of volatile and concentrated organic compounds that are produced naturally in plants [ 25].
3: EO are produced in almost all parts of the plants such as flowers, fruits, leaves, stems, seeds, buds, twigs, bark, and stored in epidermal cells, glandular trichomes, secretary cells, cavities, or canals [ 26, 27, 28, 29].
4: EO are plants secondary metabolites that play a significant role in plant reproduction, as they attract pollinators to contribute to distributing the seeds and pollens.
5: However, some EO such as oil from  Cryptomeria japonica also possess a repellent effect against arthropods and pests, which is a crucial part of the plants defense mechanism [ 30, 31].
6: These EO and their constituents are well documented for antimicrobial potentials [ 32, 33].
7: EO obtained from medicinal plants are reported to have more than 2060 constituents of different concentrations and two to three main compounds, which are usually in high amounts (2070%) [ 34].
