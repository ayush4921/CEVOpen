<p>Compounds with functional groups in the EO were found to play a role in their reactivity against pathogenic microorganisms [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-26-00628" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Therefore, the use of EO was taken as a new direction to treat microbial infections due to their antimicrobial, antifungal, and antiviral properties [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-26-00628" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. EO contain mixtures of volatile and concentrated organic compounds that are produced naturally in plants [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-26-00628" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. EO are produced in almost all parts of the plants such as flowers, fruits, leaves, stems, seeds, buds, twigs, bark, and stored in epidermal cells, glandular trichomes, secretary cells, cavities, or canals [

 <xref rid="B29-molecules-26-00628" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. EO are plants’ secondary metabolites that play a significant role in plant reproduction, as they attract pollinators to contribute to distributing the seeds and pollens. However, some EO such as oil from 
 <italic>Cryptomeria japonica</italic> also possess a repellent effect against arthropods and pests, which is a crucial part of the plant’s defense mechanism [

 <xref rid="B31-molecules-26-00628" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. These EO and their constituents are well documented for antimicrobial potentials [

 <xref rid="B33-molecules-26-00628" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. EO obtained from medicinal plants are reported to have more than 20–60 constituents of different concentrations and two to three main compounds, which are usually in high amounts (20–70%) [
