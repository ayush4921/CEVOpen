0: Among the main components of EO are two distinctive chemical groups of bio-synthetic origin: terpenes and terpenoids.
1: These compounds are usually responsible for antimicrobial action against disease-causing bacteria [ 35, 36].
2: Terpenoids are diverse natural plant products that show various pharmacological properties due to their diverse structure and functions [ 37].
3: Terpenes are one of the most valuable classes of natural origin compounds that have economic value due to their use in different sectors such as in pharmaceuticals and food [ 38], with most of the common or medicinally important terpenes being monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes.
4: Monoterpenes are found in about 90% of EO.
5: These EO have a broad spectrum activity against bacterial infections due to their high content of oxygenated monoterpenes [ 39].
6: Terpenes are the hydrocarbons that consist of isoprene units with the general formula (C 5H 8) n joined together by the head to tail rulethis meaning the fourth carbon atom of a single unit bonds with the first carbon atom of another unit to form a 1-4 linkage.
