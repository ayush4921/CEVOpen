<p>Natural products must be carefully evaluated for the antimicrobial activity of their purified EO before describing them as effective or ineffective antimicrobial agents. EO can be used in combination with common herbs such as spices, which will improve their preservative capacity for various foods including fish, sauces, meat, and soups. As mentioned earlier, EO alone may offer only a mild antimicrobial spectrum that leads to an ineffective organoleptic profile for users. As a consequence, research on the combined synergistic effect of EO and herbs may be designed in the future for a more effective and optimized utilization of these oils as preservatives while preserving their aroma and spicy taste.</p>
