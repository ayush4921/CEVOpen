<p>In the future, research studies should be done to determine the exact mechanism of action that is specific for each EO and the synergistic mechanisms between its components [

 <italic>B. cereus</italic> have become less susceptible to the antimicrobial effect of carvacrol subsequent to culturing at low concentrations of the compound [
 <xref rid="B163-molecules-26-00628" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>]. Meanwhile, a significant enhancement in the sensitivity of the same bacteria to the action of EO was observed after alteration in the phospholipids and fatty acids composition, which alter the fluidity and passive permeability of the bacterial cell membrane. Additionally, the effect of EO on the bacterial membrane proteins and phospholipids and their mechanisms is not fully understood yet. A few EO have been shown to have low toxicity to the human body; however, other EOs may affect human cells negatively and might be considered unsafe to be used. Thus, more studies are needed to check EO toxicity through many clinical phases [
