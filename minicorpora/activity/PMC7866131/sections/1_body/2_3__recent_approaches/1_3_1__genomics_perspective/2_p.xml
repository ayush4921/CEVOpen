<p>In regard to EO activity on bacterial genes, it has been found that rosemary and 
 <italic>Baccharis psiadioides</italic> EO have shown a bacteriostatic effect that impacts the development and functions of bacterial cells of 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> by upregulating and downregulating stress and virulence genes such as 
 <italic>actA</italic>, and 
 <italic>hly</italic>, thus reducing bacterial virulence [

 <italic>icaA</italic> gene and biofilms of 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B137-molecules-26-00628" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>]. Furthermore, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) has shown that cinnamaldehyde is able to kill the tested bacteria, thus indicating its effectiveness in biofilms [
 <xref rid="B137-molecules-26-00628" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>]. All these findings prove that different EO can modulate gene expression by upregulating and downregulating stress and virulence genes of different microorganisms.
