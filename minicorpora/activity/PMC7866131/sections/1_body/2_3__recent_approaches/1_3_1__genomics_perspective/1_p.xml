<p>There is a crucial need for the discovery of novel groups of antimicrobial agents to counteract the threat of MDR pathogens to reduce the rapid emergence of acquired resistance [

 <xref rid="B134-molecules-26-00628" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>]. The availability of the complete genome sequence for several pathogenic microorganisms provides extremely useful information regarding potential drug targets and is a very useful resource in order to mine for novel antimicrobial drugs [
 <xref rid="B135-molecules-26-00628" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>]. Using this approach, genome databases coupled with bioinformatics are used as tools for the transcriptional examination and recognition of the molecular basis. This will enable us to screen compounds/molecules as potential inhibitors of pathological targets and may also help us discover and optimize more effective next-generation antibiotics.
