<p>Understanding the protein profiles helps researchers find effective interactions of EO components and drugs with their targets, which are mostly proteins in nature. Over the years, MALDI-TOF MS has proved its ability to detect and quantify changes that occur in the proteomes of the bacterial cells after the exposure to EO compounds using different proteomic techniques. For example, it has been used for the identification of stress response in
