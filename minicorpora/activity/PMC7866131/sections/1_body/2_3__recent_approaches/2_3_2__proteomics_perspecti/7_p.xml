<p>On the other hand, the combination of GC and MS creates a powerful analytical tool that separates compounds by subjecting them to heat, which allows the determination of their chemical structure. Once the volatilization of the compound occurs, the quantification and qualitative identification of the compound can be recorded. These techniques enable researchers to identify major constituents and their concentrations present in EO.</p>
