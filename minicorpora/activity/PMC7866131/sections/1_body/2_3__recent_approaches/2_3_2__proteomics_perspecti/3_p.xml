<p>Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) is another emerging technology that has been proven to efficiently provide precise and reliable microorganisms identification results and has been employed in detecting antibiotic resistance as well [
 <xref rid="B141-molecules-26-00628" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>]. The sample is mixed with an energy-absorbent matrix, and a laser beam is used to ionize the samples. Then, the molecules are charged, and consequently, the time of ion flight may differ according to their mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) value [
