<p>Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry was carried out as previously described [
 <xref rid="B14-foods-10-00212" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]: Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010 Ultra instrument, electron impact (EI) mode (electron energy = 70 eV), scan range = 40–400 atomic mass units, scan rate = 3.0 scans/s, and GC-MS solution software (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Columbia, MD, USA); ZB-5 fused silica capillary column, 30 m length, 0.25 mm internal diameter, 0.25 μm film thickness (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA); He carrier gas, head pressure = 552 kPa, flow rate = 1.37 mL/min; injector temperature = 250 °C, ion source temperature = 200 °C, oven temperature program = 50 °C start, increased by 2 °C/min to 260 °C; 7% w/v solutions, 0.1 μL injections, split mode (30:1). Essential oil components were identified based on both their retention indices, which were determined by reference to a homologous
