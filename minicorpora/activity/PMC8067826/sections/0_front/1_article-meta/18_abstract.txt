0: Food poisoning is a common cause of illness and death in developing countries.
1: Essential oils (EOs) could be effective and safe natural preservatives to prevent and control bacterial contamination of foods.
2: However, their high sensitivity and strong flavor limit their application and biological effectiveness.
3: The aim of this study was firstly the chemical analysis and the antimicrobial evaluation of the EOs of   Origanum onites L. and   Satureja thymbra L. obtained from Symi island (Greece), and, secondly, the formulation of propylene glycol-nanovesicles loaded with these EOs to improve their antimicrobial properties.
4: The EOs were analyzed by GC-MS and their chemical contents are presented herein.
5: Different nanovesicles were formulated with small average sizes, high homogeneity, and optimal -potential.
6: Microscopic observation confirmed their small and spherical shape.
7: Antibacterial and antifungal activities of the formulated EOs were evaluated against food-borne pathogens and spoilage microorganisms compared to pure EOs.
8: Propylene glycol-nanovesicles loaded with   O. onites EO were found to be the most active formulation against all tested strains.
9: Additionally, in vitro studies on the HaCaT cell line showed that nanovesicles encapsulated with EOs had no toxic effect.
10: The present study revealed that both EOs can be used as alternative sanitizers and preservatives in the food industry, and that their formulation in nanovesicles can provide a suitable approach as food-grade delivery system.
