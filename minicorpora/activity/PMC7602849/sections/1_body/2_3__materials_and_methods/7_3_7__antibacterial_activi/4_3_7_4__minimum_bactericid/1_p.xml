<p>The bactericidal capacity of oregano oil was determined from the last three wells that showed no bacterial growth in the MIC assay, as described by Taylor et al. [
 <xref rid="B51-metabolites-10-00414" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. For this, 100 ÂµL of these cultures were taken and plated in nutrient broth plates supplemented with agar. As a growth control, a culture that did show microbial growth in the MIC test was used. The plates were incubated for 24 h at the corresponding temperature, after which the concentration of oregano oil where no growth was observed (MBC) was determined for each microorganism.
