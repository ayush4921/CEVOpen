<p>GC-MS analysis was carried out as described by Teixeira et al., with some modifications [
 <xref rid="B24-metabolites-10-00414" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The essential oil was analyzed using an Agilent 5975 gas chromatograph coupled to an Agilent 5973N mass-selective detector (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA., USA). It was fitted with an HP-5MS capillary column (30 m length × 0.32 mm internal diameter × 0.25 µm film thickness). The oven temperature was programmed at 45 °C for 1 min, raised to 250 °C at 5 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup>, and maintained at 250 °C for 5 min. Helium was used as carrier gas at 30 cm s
 <sup>−1</sup>, and the injection volume was 1 µL. The identity of each compound was assigned by comparing their retention index relative to a standard mixture of 
 <italic>n</italic>-alkanes, as well as by comparison with the mass spectra characteristic features obtained from the Wiley data bank (Wiley 7N Edition [Agilent Part No. G1035B]: Wiley Registry of Mass Spectral Data, 7th Edition), whenever possible, co-injections with authentic samples.
