<p>Total polyphenol content was determined using the Folin-Ciocalteu method, with some modifications [
 <xref rid="B38-metabolites-10-00414" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. From the 50 g/L solution, one was prepared at 0.5 g/L, where an aliquot of the solution (1000 μL) was mixed with 500 μL of Folin-Ciocalteu reagent (50% 
 <italic>v/v</italic>) and 5000 μL of ethanol at 80% 
 <italic>v/v</italic>. After 5 min of reaction, 250 µL of 5% 
 <italic>w/v</italic> Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> was added and brought to a final volume of 8000 µL with 80% 
 <italic>v/v</italic> ethanol. This was then allowed to incubate for 30 min at room temperature. Each sample was measured at 760 nm and compared to a calibration curve using gallic acid as the standard.
