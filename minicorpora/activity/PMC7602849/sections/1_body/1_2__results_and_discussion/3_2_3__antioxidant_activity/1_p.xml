<p>Because the antioxidant capacity cannot be fully described by a single method, for this study, the antioxidant capacities of 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> essential oil were assayed with three different assays. Free radical scavenging capacities were measured using DPPH radical and ABTS radical cation. The values found are given in 
 <xref rid="metabolites-10-00414-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The DPPH radical scavenging activity of the oregano oil from the arid region was very low (4750 ± 91.11 μmol Trolox/g); however, our result agrees with other authors’ observations on oregano oil ranging from 1509 μg/mL to 8900 μg/mL [

 <xref rid="B30-metabolites-10-00414" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The value found for ABTS (1252.74 μmol Trolox/g) is higher than that reported by Sarikurkcu for the same species cultivated at 372 m above sea level [
