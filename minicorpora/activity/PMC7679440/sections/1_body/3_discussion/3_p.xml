<p id="p0090">Our GC/MS analysis showed that fenchol (37.3%) was the major constituent in TCEO, followed by 3-cyclohexene-1-methanol (25.7%) and borneol (9.6%) (
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Our results are partly in agreement with a study from 
 <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">Ali et al. (2013)</xref>, who reported that 
 <italic>endo</italic>-fenchol (21.2%), 
 <italic>trans</italic>-pinene hydrate (8.8%), and caryophyllene oxide (7.5%) were the main constituents in the 
 <italic>T. camphoratus</italic> essential oil grown in Yemen (
 <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">Ali et al., 2013</xref>). Fenchol was also the main constituent of 
 <italic>T. camphoratus</italic> grown in Kenya, but the percent (15.9%) was different from what we found in this study (37.3%) (

 <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">Costa et al. (2008)</xref>, were observed. 
 <italic>T. camphoratus</italic> grown in South Africa were found to have a different essential oil chemical composition (
 <xref rid="b0155" ref-type="bibr">Nanyonga et al., 2013</xref>). These variations in chemical composition could be attributed to several factors, including geographical location, ecological conditions, harvesting conditions, postharvest waiting times until distillation, distillation techniques, or storage (
