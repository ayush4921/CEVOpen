<p id="p0045">An Apoptosis Detection Kit FITC Annexin V with PI (ThermoFisher Scientific, CA, USA) was used per the manufacturer's instructions to validate evidence of early vs late apoptosis and necrosis in the cancer cells. Briefly, MCF-7 cells were seeded in 6-well culture plates (2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well) for 24 h, then treated with TCEO (12.5 and 25 µg/ mL) for another 24 h. After incubation, cells were collected and washed twice with PBS, then resuspended in Annexin V-binding buffer (100 µL). Thereafter, 5 μL of each Annexin V-FITC and PI dyes were added and incubated for 15 min in the dark. Apoptotic vs necrotic cell populations were analyzed via flow cytometry (Cytomics FC 500; Beckman Coulter, CA, USA). Data collection and analysis were performed using CXP software V. 3.0.
