0: Tarchonanthus Camphoratus L. is traditionally known for its various medicinal purposes.
1: In this study, the   T. camphoratus essential oil (TCEO) was isolated via steam distillation, and its chemical constituents were determined using GCMS.
2: The   in vitro antiproliferative effects of TCEO on A549, HepG2, MCF-7 cancer cells, and HUVEC non-tumor cells was investigated using an MTT assay.
3: Flow cytometry analysis was conducted to evaluate cell cycle distribution using propidium iodide staining, and cell death mode using Annexin V-FITC/PI assays.
4: The expression of some apoptosis related genes was investigated using qRT-PCR.
5: Major constituents of TCEO included fenchol, borneol, 3-cyclohexene-1-methanol and 3-ethyl-3-methyl.
6: Cell viability test showed that TCEO is highly effective against MCF-7 cells with IC  50 12.5 g/mL.
7: Cell cycle arrest at the G1/S phase, and apoptosis mediation were evident in the presence of TCEO.
8: Gene expression analysis of several pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic genes revealed the initiation of apoptosis in TCEO-MCF-7 cells.
9: In conclusion, our study confirms the antiproliferative activity of the   T. camphoratus essential oil.
