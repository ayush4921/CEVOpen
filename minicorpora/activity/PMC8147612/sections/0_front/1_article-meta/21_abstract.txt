0: Zingiber ottensii Valeton (ZO) exhibits pharmacological activity and has long been used in traditional medicine.
1: However, reports about its safety profiles are limited.
2: The present study aimed to evaluate the phytochemical profile and the toxic effects of ZO essential oil on the development of zebrafish and acute oral toxicity in rats.
3: The essential oil was isolated from ZO rhizomes, and phytochemicals were analyzed using a gas chromatographymass spectrometer (GCMS).
4: The embryotoxic and teratogenic effects of ZO essential oil were evaluated in zebrafish embryos and larvae and the acute oral toxicity was determined in rats.
5: GCMS results showed the essential oil contained zerumbone as a major phytoconstituent (24.73%).
6: The zebrafish embryotoxicity of ZO essential oil appeared to be concentration- and time-dependent manner, with a moderate LC  50 (1.003 g/mL).
7: Teratogenicity in zebrafish embryos also included morphological defects, decreased hatchability, and reduced heart rate.
8: In rats, ZO essential oil (2000 mg/kg, p.o.)
9: resulted in no mortality or significant toxicities.
10: These findings suggest that ZO has embryotoxic and teratogenic effects in zebrafish embryos but does not result in death or acute oral toxicity in rats.
11: Further long-term toxicity studies are needed to confirm the safety of products developed from ZO essential oil.
