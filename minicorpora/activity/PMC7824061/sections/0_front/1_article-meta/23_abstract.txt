0: The   Curcuma genus has been extensively used for therapeutic purposes in traditional or folk medicine worldwide, including for its anti-inflammatory activity.
1: Curcuma spp.s active constituents, such as alkaloids, flavonoids, and terpenoids, can act on various targets in the signaling pathway, restrain pro-inflammatory enzymes, lower the production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and reduce oxidative stress, which subsequently suppresses inflammatory processes.
2: Preclinical and clinical studies have reported the predominant anti-inflammatory activity of several   Curcuma species.
3: This review provides an overview of the anti-inflammatory effects of different extracts, preparations, and bioactive components in this genus.
4: This analysis may provide a scientific basis for developing new and alternative methods for the isolation of a single entity from this genus to attenuate inflammatory conditions.
5: The   Curcuma genus is waiting for researchers interested in developing safe and efficient anti-inflammatory agents for further investigation.
