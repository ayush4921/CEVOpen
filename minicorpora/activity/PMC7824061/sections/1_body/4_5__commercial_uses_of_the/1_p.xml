<p>The species belonging to the 
 <italic>Curcuma</italic> genus have been well-established in terms of their commercial values, such as food and medicinal values. Sixteen species possess high commercial values, and their rhizomes were assessed as the most important edible portion of the plants. A substantial amount of yellow dye originates from the rhizome of 
 <italic>Curcuma</italic>, which has traditionally been used as food preservatives, flavoring agents, spices, and as a household cure for treating many diseases [

 <italic>C. angustifolia</italic>, 
 <italic>C. leucorrhiza</italic>, and 
 <italic>C. caulina</italic> are reasonable sources of carbohydrates and are also used as nutritious food substitutes, along with being a substitution for true arrowroot powder. In contrast, the rhizomes of 
 <italic>C. aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>C. amada</italic>, 
 <italic>C. longa</italic>, 
 <italic>C. aromatica</italic>, 
 <italic>C. pierreana</italic>, 
 <italic>C. xanthorrhiza</italic>, 
 <italic>C. pseudomontana</italic>, and 
 <italic>C. zedoaria</italic> are often used as spices and dyes, as well as coloring and flavoring agents in food preparations, which is primarily due to their exotic fragrance. Additional sections, including tuberous roots, inflorescence, and rootstocks, are similarly good sources of carbohydrates and proteins and are used in cooking preparations and as food appetizers and vegetables [

 <italic>Curcuma</italic> possesses plenty of pharmacological activities, which make them valuable constituents in pharmaceutical industries. Mujumdar et al. found that the alcohol extracts derived from 
 <italic>C. amada</italic> comprise several constituents, such as the functional groups of olefin, hydroxyl, carbonyl, and ester, which were found to have anti-inflammatory effects at acute and chronic administrations in albino rats [

 <italic>C. aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>C. caesia</italic>, 
 <italic>C. angustifolia</italic>, 
 <italic>C. phaeocaulis</italic>, 
 <italic>C. leucorrhiza</italic>, 
 <italic>C. mangga</italic>, 
 <italic>C. longa</italic>, and 
 <italic>C. purpurascens</italic> have been established as a treatment for quite a lot of physiological disorders, such as dysentery, indigestion, stomach ulcer, gastrointestinal disorders, diabetes, enlarged liver and spleen, fever, boils, cough, scabies, body pain, chest pain, hepatic disorders, bruises, anorexia, rheumatism, dyspepsia, wound healing, sinusitis, bleeding, and infection [
