0: Inflammation is regarded as a complex biological process that is mainly mediated by the disruption of tissue homeostasis.
1: Inflammation is triggered by the presence of different biological, chemical, or physical agents and can be defined as acute or chronic depending on the type of stimuli.
2: The immune system is always active to eliminate the damaging effect of acute inflammation; however, the failure of this response paves the way for a chronic phase, leading to an inflammatory cascade, which can ultimately develop several diseases, including chronic asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and psoriasis.
3: Experimental studies and clinical epidemiological data have established chronic infections and inflammation as significant risk factors for different forms of cancer [ 5].
4: In the past, nearly 1520% of all cancer deaths have been estimated as being due to underlying infections and inflammatory reactions [ 5].
5: Although several therapeutic agents, including corticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and biologics drugs, are used mainly in the case of inflammation, they possess not only various adverse effects but these biologics are expensive.
6: Therefore, to limit the drawbacks of both synthetic and biologic drugs, phytocompounds obtained from numerous medicinal plants have been used as ideal substitutes.
7: The enormous research work on medicinal plants consolidates the hypothesis for using plant extracts as therapeutic agents due to the synergistic and additive effects of individual constituents [ 5].
