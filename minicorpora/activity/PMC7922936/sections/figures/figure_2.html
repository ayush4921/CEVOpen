 <caption> Cytotoxic activity of E. intisy essential oil on leukemia HL-60, HL-60R, and differentiated Caco-2 cell lines. Cells were exposed to EO for 72 h, at different concentrations and viability was assessed by MTS assay. Data are expressed as mean ± standard error of three experiments performed in triplicate. Different letters represent significant differences (Tukey’s test) in cytotoxic activity among the concentrations of each cell line ( p &lt; 0.05). </caption>
