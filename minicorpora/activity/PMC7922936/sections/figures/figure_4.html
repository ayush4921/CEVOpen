 <caption> NF-κB (p65 subunit) DNA binding capacity in nuclear extracts of HL-60 and HL-60R cells. The cells were treated for 24 h with E. intisy essential oil (25 μg/mL). Results (mean ± standard error of three experiments carried out in duplicate) are expressed as arbitrary units/μg protein of cells nuclear extracts. Statistical differences are * p &lt; 0.01 vs. control (Tukey’s test). </caption>
