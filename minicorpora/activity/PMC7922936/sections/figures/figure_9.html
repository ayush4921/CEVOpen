 <caption> Effects of E. intisy EO (5–50 µg/mL) on P-gp basal ATPase activity. The data are expressed as fold changes of P-gp ATPase activity compared to basal one (ΔRLU TC/ΔRLU basal) and are presented as mean ± SE of three experiments, each in duplicate. * Differences when treatments are compared to the basal activity p &lt; 0.01 (Tukey’s test). </caption>
