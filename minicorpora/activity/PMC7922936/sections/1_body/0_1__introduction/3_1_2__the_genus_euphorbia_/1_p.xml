 <italic>Euphorbia</italic> species have a large spectrum of traditional medicinal uses [
 <xref rid="B17-pharmaceuticals-14-00111" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] ranging from digestive system disorders, skin aliments, infections/infestations, injuries/inflammations and respiratory complaints; some species are cited as vertebrate poisons [
 <xref rid="B18-pharmaceuticals-14-00111" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These knowledges are supported by a broad range of biological properties and potential usages in derived natural products [
