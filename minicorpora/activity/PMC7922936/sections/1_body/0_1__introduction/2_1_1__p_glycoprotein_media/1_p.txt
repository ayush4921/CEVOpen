0: In the MDR process a key role is played by P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a drug efflux pump which is responsible for the decrease in intracellular drug accumulation.
1: P-gp is the most studied drug efflux pumps, described for the first time by Juliano and Ling [ 2].
2: It is part of a vast superfamily of ATP-dependent transporters, a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of about 170 kDa encoded by human gene ATP-binding cassette sub-family B member 1 (ABCB1) or Multi Drug Resistance 1 (MDR1), consists of a dozen transmembrane domains of six extracellular loops and two adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding sites.
3: The physiological role of P-gp, present in different tissues such as the liver, bloodbrain barrier, lymphocytes, testicles, placenta, small and large intestines, is to protect and regulate the absorption, distribution, and excretion of xenobiotics and drugs.
4: Numerous molecules have been proposed to bypass the multidrug resistance due to the overexpression of P-gp.
5: The main pharmacological strategy of preclinical and clinical research to overcome MDR and revert the resistant phenotype is represented by the co-administration of anticancer chemotherapy drug and P-gp substrate-inhibitor compounds in order to restore the effective therapeutic concentration of the drug in the tumor resistant cells [ 3].
6: The P-gp inhibition can occur by molecules that compete for the binding site with the substrate, or by non-competitive or allosteric inhibition, blocking ATP hydrolysis and altering the lipid layer of cell membranes or affecting P-gp expression.
7: In this context, natural products are considered as a new source of drugs to be used in multidrug resistant diseases and a valid alternative therapy to those currently in use.
8: Some secondary metabolites isolated from different plants were reported as P-gp expression or activity inhibitors, such as flavonoids, coumarins, terpenoids, alkaloids, and steroidal saponins [ 4].
