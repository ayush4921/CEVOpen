<p>The DNA binding capacity of NF-κB (p65 subunit) was measured in the nuclear extracts of cells treated using the TransAM NF-κB and Nuclear ExtractTM Kits (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The results were expressed as arbitrary units: One unit is the DNA binding capacity shown by 2.5 µg of whole cell extract from Jurkat cells stimulated with 12-Otetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) + calcium ionophore (CI)/µg protein of HL-60/R nuclear extracts. </p>
