 <italic>E. intisy</italic> EO, doxorubicin, or their combinations) at the indicated concentrations. Following 72 h of treatment, 15 µL commercial solution obtained from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI, USA) containing 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulphophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) and phenazine ethosulfate was added. The plates were incubated in a humidified atmosphere at 37 ˚C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 2 h, and the bioreduction of MTS dye was evaluated by measuring the absorbance of each well at 490 nm using a microplate absorbance reader (iMark Microplate Reader; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA). Cell growth inhibition was expressed as a percentage of the absorbance of the control cells. For the combinations, to evaluate the type of interaction between the agents, dose-effect curves were analyzed according to the Chou and Talalay method [
 <xref rid="B59-pharmaceuticals-14-00111" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] using CalcuSyn® software (version 2.1; Biosoft, Cambridge, UK) as a non-constant ratio combination. The combination index (CI) indicates a quantitative measure of the degree of drug interaction in terms of synergistic (CI &lt; 1), additive (CI = 1) or antagonistic (CI &gt; 1) effects.
