<p>Total RNA was extracted from cell lines using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). For the evaluation of gene expression, RNA was reverse transcribed using a high-capacity complementary DNA (cDNA) reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems Life Technologies Inc., Foster City, CA, USA). The resulting cDNAs were subjected to real-time RT-PCR using the TaqMan Gene Expression Master Mix kit (Applied Biosystems Life Technologies Inc., Foster City, CA, USA) in triplicates. The PCR cycling conditions were as follows: Denaturation at 50 °C for 2 min, annealing at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 sec and extension at 60 °C for 60 min. The running of the samples and data collection were performed on a StepOne AB Real Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems Life Technologies Inc., Foster City, CA, USA). β-actin was used as an internal standard. The specific TaqMan Assay used were: Survivin Hs00153353, XIAP Hs00236913, Bcl-2 Hs00236329, ABCB1 Hs00184005 (Applied Biosystems Life Technologies Inc., Foster City, CA, USA). Relative expression was calculated using the comparative Ct method [∆Ct = Ct(target gene)−Ct(housekeeping gene)]. Where Ct was the fractional cycle number at which the fluorescence of each sample passed the fixed threshold. Fluorescence was measured at 515–518 nm using StepOne AB Real Time PCR System software (Applied Biosystems Life Technologies Inc., Foster City, CA, USA). The ∆∆Ct method was used to determine gene expression levels. ∆∆Ct was calculated using the formula: ∆∆Ct = ∆Ct
 <sub>(each sample)</sub>−∆Ct
 <sub>(reference sample)</sub>. Fold change was calculated using the 2 
 <sup>−∆∆Ct</sup> equation.
