<p>P-gp ATPase activity was performed with Pgp-Glo™ Assay Systems (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) following manufacturer’s instructions. Different concentrations of 
 <italic>E. intisy</italic> EO (test compound, TC) were added to a 96-well white plate in duplicate and incubated with recombinant human P-gp membranes. No treatment control (NT) with only Pgp-GLO assay buffer was used to provide a measure of unregulated ATPase activity, while Na
 <sub>3</sub>VO
 <sub>4</sub> (0.25 mM) was used as the selective inhibitor of P-gp ATPase activity and provides a measure of P-gp-independent ATPase activity. Verapamil (0.5 mM) is a P-gp substrate that stimulates P-gp ATPase activity and serves as a positive control for drug stimulation of P-gp ATPase activity. We also performed an ATP Standards curve as internal control, to verify the correct execution of the assay, and another control with DMSO (equivalent amount of higher concentration of 
 <italic>E. intisy</italic> EO). MgATP (5 mM) was added to initiate the ATPase activity. After 40 min incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped with 50 μL ATPase Detection Reagent and then incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Luminescence was measured using a GLOMAX Multidetection System (Promega). We calculated ΔRLU
 <sub>basal</sub> that reflects basal P-gp ATPase activity as the difference between the average luminescent signals from Na
 <sub>3</sub>VO
 <sub>4</sub>-treated samples (RLU
 <sub>Na3VO4</sub>) and untreated (NT) samples (RLU
 <sub>NT</sub>). After, we calculated ΔRLU
 <sub>TC</sub> that reflects P-gp ATPase activity in the presence of a test compound, as the difference between the average luminescent signals from Na
 <sub>3</sub>VO
 <sub>4</sub>-treated samples (RLU
 <sub>Na3VO4</sub>) and test compound-treated samples (RLU
 <sub>TC</sub>). The data were presented as change in luminescence (ΔRLU). To confirm that the EO acts like the verapamil, we examined its inhibitory effects against a verapamil-stimulated P-gp ATPase activity; in this case verapamil is added in the TC wells, and the results presented as RLU produced by EO on stimulated P-gp.
