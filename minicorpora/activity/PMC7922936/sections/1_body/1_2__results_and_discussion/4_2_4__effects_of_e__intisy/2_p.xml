<p>The results indicate a significant increase in fluorescence in HL-60R of the samples pretreated with 
 <italic>E. intisy</italic> essential oil, showing an intracellular accumulation of doxorubicin after exposure at different times. Unexpectedly, in HL-60 the pretreatment with EO reduces the accumulation of doxorubicin (only 2 h after treatment with doxorubicin) in respect to its control. These data could suggest that in HL-60R cells 
 <italic>E. intisy</italic> EO acts like an inhibitor of P-gp function, as verapamil that produced similar results on doxorubicin accumulation (

 <xref rid="B49-pharmaceuticals-14-00111" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] who demonstrated that oxygenated terpenes potentiate the classical drug efficacy by augmenting their concentrations inside the cells. It is interesting to note that despite 
 <italic>E. intisy</italic> EO shows a lower accumulation of doxorubicin in respect to verapamil, it has a low cytotoxic effect (
