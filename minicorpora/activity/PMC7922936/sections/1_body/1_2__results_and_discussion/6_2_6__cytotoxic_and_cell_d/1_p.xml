<p>Given the results obtained, we wanted to verify whether the increasing intracellular accumulation of doxorubicin caused by 
 <italic>E. intisy</italic> EO would lead to greater cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin in HL-60R. The effects of 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>intisy</italic> EO and doxorubicin alone or in combination on the inhibition of cell growth were evaluated using MTS assays, while cell death was evaluated by flow cytometry analysis of DNA stained with propidium iodide. In 
 <xref rid="pharmaceuticals-14-00111-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, we report the percentages of cell growth inhibition by EO and doxorubicin treatments alone. As expected, 
 <italic>E. intisy</italic> EO carried out a strong potentiation effects of doxorubicin in terms of cell growth inhibition in HL-60 R, as indicated by the combination indices (
 <xref rid="pharmaceuticals-14-00111-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). The combination of the essential oil (25 Âµg/mL) and doxorubicin at different concentrations in HL-60R cells also caused a significant potentiation in the induction of cell death (
