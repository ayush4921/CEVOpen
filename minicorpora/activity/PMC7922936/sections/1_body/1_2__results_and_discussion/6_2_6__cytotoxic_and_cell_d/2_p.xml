<p>Our results agree with those reported by Neto et al. [
 <xref rid="B56-pharmaceuticals-14-00111" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] and Reies et al. [
 <xref rid="B57-pharmaceuticals-14-00111" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] that show that 
 <italic>Euphorbia</italic> secondary metabolites were more efficient than verapamil in reverting MDR phenotypes. For this reason, we hypothesize that 
 <italic>E. intisy</italic> EO can represent an effective and non-toxic P-gp inhibitor to reverse P-gp-mediated multidrug resistance and improve the potency of anticancer drugs.
