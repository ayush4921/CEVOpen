<p>To further confirm these outcomes, we performed the same assay adding verapamil in the wells treated with EO and the results are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceuticals-14-00111-f010">Figure 10</xref>. The data obtained demonstrated that EO not only stimulated basal P-gp ATPase activity, but also increased verapamil-stimulated P-gp ATPase activity. These results suggested that EO might be a stimulator of ATP-dependent drug efflux transporter, acting as substrate for transport by P-gp that stimulates P-gp ATPase activity, and lead to the inhibition of P-gp efflux function, in the same way verapamil acts.
