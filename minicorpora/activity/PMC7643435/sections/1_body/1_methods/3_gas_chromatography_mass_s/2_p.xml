<p id="Par25">Initial volatile organic compounds (VOC) identification was made by comparison of obtained mass spectra of each component from CKEO with the mass spectra available in the NIST library (National Institute of Standards and Technology) database. Thus, the VOCs with ≥70% quality match score were presented in this report in the chemical terminology of the NIST database, while unidentified compound’s area were lumped together.</p>
