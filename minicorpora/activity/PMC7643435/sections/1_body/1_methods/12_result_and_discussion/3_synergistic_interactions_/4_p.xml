<p id="Par43">To understand the efficacy of CKEO and streptomycin alone and in combination, the time-kill assay was performed and the viable cell number in terms of CFU was calculated. The treatment with CKEO/streptomycin led to a dose-dependent response in terms of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> cell number (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). At 2xMIC value, CKEO/streptomycin had totally eradicated the pathogen. At 2xFICI value, the combination of CKEO and streptomycin was found bacteriostatic but at 3xFICI value, pathogenic cells were completely eradicated within 30 min of exposure.
