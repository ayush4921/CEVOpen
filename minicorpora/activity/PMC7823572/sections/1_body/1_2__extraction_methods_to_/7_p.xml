<p>The use of microwave energy (solvent-free microwave extraction (SFME) and microwave-assisted extraction (MAE)) shares similar advantages as the previous cases: a reduction of costs, extraction times, energy consumption and CO

 <xref rid="B97-plants-10-00044" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. It represents a more efficient method for extraction of essential oils from the 
 <italic>Zingibereaceace</italic> family, because it is able to reduce the extraction time from four h in hydrodistillation to one h, avoiding the formation of degradation products and obtaining the maximum yield [

Furthermore, the use of microwave extraction gives rise to other categories of techniques to improve its performance, such as hydrodistillation assisted by microwave (HDAM), steam distillation assisted by microwave (SDAM), vacuum microwave hydrodistillation (VMHD) or microwave by hydrodiffusion and gravity (MHG) [
