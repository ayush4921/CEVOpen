0: On the other hand, the essential oil is the one that provides the  C. longa rhizome a particular spicy and aromatic flavour [ 3, 15] with its distinctive chemical composition.
1: In general, sesquiterpenes are the predominant phytochemical group in  C. longa rhizome oil [ 33].
2: More concretely, ar-, - and turmerones are usually the major and most representative components [ 34, 35], although numerous intrinsic and extrinsic elements may influence in their quality and quantity [ 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41].
3: Nevertheless, this chemical composition is different from the essential oil extracted from the aerial parts in which monoterpenes (-phellandrene, terpinolene, 1,8-cineole, etc.)
4: stand out [ 42, 43, 44, 45, 46].
5: Countless beneficial health effects have been attributed to  C. longa rhizome oil as a consequence of this particular chemical composition: cardiovascular protection, antihyperlipidemic, antiglycaemic, antioxidant, antiplatelet, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiarthritic, etc.
6: [ 47].
7: Especially, abundant research has been focused on ar-turmerone, demonstrating its promising interesting medicinal properties, like the protection against the development of certain tumours [ 48, 49], antifungal activity against dermatophytes [ 50], antiangiogenic effects [ 51], anticonvulsant properties [ 52] and treatment of neurodegenerative and other inflammatory diseases, such as psoriasis [ 53, 54].
