0: Furthermore, rhizomes are a rich source of two major products with remarkable attributes: curcuminoids and essential oils [ 17].
1: On the one hand, curcuminoids are the responsible for the previously described orange-yellow colour [ 15].
2: They particularly refer to a group of three phenolic compounds, curcumin, desmethoxycurcumin and bisdesmethoxycurcumin, belonging to the diarylheptanoid family.
3: They consist of a diketonic hydroxycarbon skeleton with different functional groups, depending on the curcuminoid [ 18, 19].
4: Their content in the  C. longa rhizome may vary according to many factors, such as the variety and geographic location, as well as cultivation and postharvest processing conditions [ 17, 20].
5: For these secondary metabolites, turmeric is commonly employed as a spice and additives that provide colour and flavour in the food industry [ 21].
6: Additionally, they have demonstrated promising antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, being considered a valuable complementary therapy to pharmaceuticals in Crohns, diabetes and cancer between other disorders [ 15, 21, 22].
7: Unfortunately, their poor solubility, low absorption and bioavailability, as well as high metabolic rate, limit their use for therapeutic purposes [ 23, 24, 25, 26].
8: In fact, the major component curcumin has not been approved as a therapeutic agent yet due to its pharmacokinetics and physicochemical properties, despite it is generally considered a safe substance [ 24, 27].
9: In response, curcuminoids have been associated with lipids, micelles, nanoparticles and other molecules to enhance their effects.
10: An example is the binding of curcumin with phosphocaseins.
11: This combination represents a suitable vector to deliver efficiently the compound, as well as other drugs and nutrients in general.
12: New analogues with improved activity are being tried to develop from the original ones [ 21, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32].
