 <italic>C. longa</italic> rhizome essential oil has also exhibited strong antioxidant potential when combined with other essential oils—for instance, 
 <italic>Z. officinale</italic>. In this case, the combination of both showed higher DPPH radical scavenging activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 3.75 µL/mL vs. 4.28 and 7.19 µL/mL), as well as stronger β-carotene–linoleic acid bleaching (65.24% vs. 59.88 and 55.82%) than
