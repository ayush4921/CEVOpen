<p>Regarding turmeric, the rhizome essential oil (38.7% ar-turmerone, 18.6% β-turmerone and 14.2% α-turmerone) has proven to be a potential post-emergent treatment in the control of weeds such as common purslane (
 <italic>Portulaca oleracea</italic> L.), especially aggressive in agriculture because of its versatility in affecting a wide variety of scenarios due to its tolerance to changes and rapid growing [

Concretely, it reduced the hypocotyl development of the three weeds 56.55%, 40.45% and 39.33%, respectively, from 0.125 to 1 µL/mL, without affecting either the seed germination or the hypocotyl growth of the tomato, cucumber and rice crops [
