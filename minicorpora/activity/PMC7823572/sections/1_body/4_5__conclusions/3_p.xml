<p>This versatility is mainly due to the characteristic chemical composition of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> rhizome essential oil. Usually, sesquiterpenes constitute the main phytochemical group identified, and turmerones are the most representative components. However, this pattern is subjected to changes depending on countless internal (genetics) and external (geographic location, cultivation conditions, post-harvest processing, etc.) factors. For this reason, predictive models need to be developed to previse the chemical composition of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> rhizome essential oil according to the conditions surrounding the plant. In this way, the control of these factors is useful to obtain a high-yield essential oil with the aimed chemical composition, convenient for carrying out a specific activity in the agri-food industry in an optimum way.
