<p>The sustainable and efficient encapsulation of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> rhizome oil represents the ultimate step for its implementation in the agri-food industry. Current research is oriented to solve the limitations when applying turmeric essential oil (volatility, instability under certain conditions and hydrophobicity), with the aim of longer preserving its numerous benefits and improving its performance. Biodegradable and biocompatible products as edible alginate-based films with turmeric represent advantages over traditional plastic containers, increasing the antioxidant capacity and extending the shelf-lives of the final products. Many encapsulation methods, including β-cyclodextrines, chitosan–alginate, microemulsions, nanoparticles etc., have been described to enhance the curcumin bioavailability. They represent potential options to also enhance the beneficial properties of the essential oil of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> rhizome and its components, as well as controlling their release. A complex study regarding the cost-efficiency and sustainability, as well as threshold concentrations not to harm crops and food, have to be taken into account.
