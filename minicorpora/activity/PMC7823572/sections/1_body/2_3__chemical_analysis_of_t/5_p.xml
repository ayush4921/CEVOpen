<p>The amount of monoterpene hydrocarbons and oxygenated monoterpenes are usually lower in most samples of rhizome essential oil of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> (
 <xref rid="plants-10-00044-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Contrarily, they constitute the most abundant group in the rhizome oil of other different 
 <italic>Curcuma</italic> spp., such as 
 <italic>C. amada</italic> [

 <italic>C. longa</italic> essential oil varied between the leaves (23%), rhizomes (48%) and rhizoids (27%), and the chemical composition was different between the leaf petiole, lamina and rhizoid oils (myrcene, 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene, etc.) compared to the stem and rhizome ones in which turmerones predominated [

 <italic>C. longa</italic> grown in Nigeria, the leaf essential oil was dominated by turmerones, like in rhizomes (
