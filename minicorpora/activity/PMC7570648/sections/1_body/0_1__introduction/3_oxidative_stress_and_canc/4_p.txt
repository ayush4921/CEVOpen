0: Antioxidants in diet and supplements are widely used to protect cells from the damage induced by ROS.
1: However, some clinical trials have shown conflicting results that do not support this concept.
2: Based on recent studies, antioxidants may increase melanoma metastasis in mice [ 21, 22] and accelerate tumor progression in later stages of lung cancer [ 23].
3: One explanation of the antioxidant activity in promoting tumor growth is the disruption of the ROS-p53 axis, which is related to the somatic mutation in p53 that occurred in the late stage of tumor progression [ 23].
4: In fact, mutant p53 isoforms cannot apply antioxidant activities, and rather induce intracellular ROS and promote a pro-tumorigenic survival [ 24].
5: Interestingly, the administration of mitochondria and non-mitochondria-targeted antioxidants resulted in two distinguished outcomes of liver cancer prevention by altering DNA repair [ 25].
6: Figure 1 describes the role of oxidative stress in cancer.
