0: In our body, redox homeostasis balances the oxidative stress via enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants.
1: Several types of antioxidants have critical roles in ROS elimination, including dietary natural antioxidants, like tocopherol, selenium, -carotene, ascorbic acid, polyphenol metabolites, and synthetic antioxidants (e.g., N-acetylcysteine).
2: On the contrary, many endogenous antioxidant molecules contribute in this role, such as glutathione, -lipoic acid, coenzyme Q, ferritin, uric acid, bilirubin, metallothionein, L-carnitine, and melatonin.
3: Endogenous antioxidant enzymes are also involved in balancing the oxidative stress.
4: These enzymes include superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione reductase (Gr), thioredoxin reductase (TRX), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidases (GPXs) and peroxiredoxins (PRXs) [ 13].
