<p>All cancer phases entailing initiation, promotion and progression are affected by oxidative stress. Oxidative stress has the ability to activate several transcription factors including nuclear factor (NF)-κB, hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α, activator protein (AP)-1, p53, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ,β-catenin/Wnt, and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). These factors regulate the expression of diverse genes included in immune modulation, inflammatory response, carcinogenesis, metastasis, tissue remodeling and fibrosis [
