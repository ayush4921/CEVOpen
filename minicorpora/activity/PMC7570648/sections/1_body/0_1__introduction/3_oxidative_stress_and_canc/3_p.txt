0: All cancer phases entailing initiation, promotion and progression are affected by oxidative stress.
1: Oxidative stress has the ability to activate several transcription factors including nuclear factor (NF)-B, hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1, activator protein (AP)-1, p53, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-,-catenin/Wnt, and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2).
2: These factors regulate the expression of diverse genes included in immune modulation, inflammatory response, carcinogenesis, metastasis, tissue remodeling and fibrosis [ 12, 16].
3: Besides that, ROS activate signaling pathways associated with cell growth, e.g., p38MAPK, p70S6K, p90Rsk, JAK/STAT, JNK, ERK, RAS, AKT and phospholipase D [ 13].
4: Moreover, ROS can oxidize cysteine residues in tyrosine phosphatases, for example PTEN and PTP-1B, and decrease their activities.
5: Such changes promote hyper-activation of the PI3K and AKT pathways [ 17].
6: Additionally, pro-angiogenic factors, like HIF-1, actuate the transcription of angiogenic factors, such as VEGF, leading to neovascularization [ 18].
7: NOX1-derived RO stimulates angiogenic switch in fibroblasts and matrix remodeling [ 19].
8: In addition, iron-induced oxidative stress by ferric nitrilotriacetate (Fe-NTA) assesses in p16/p15 tumor suppressor genes deletion which results in carcinogenesis [ 20].
