0: Oxidative stress is the unbalance between production and elimination of free radicals and reactive species, like reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) [ 11, 12].
1: Oxidative stress is responsible for causing damage in cells and vital biomolecules.
2: It is associated with induction of chronic inflammation and subsequently the development of many diseases including cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular, neurological and pulmonary diseases [ 12].
3: Oxidative stress is produced by external sources, like UV radiation, toxic chemicals and drugs, by physiological changes such as aging and inflammation and by internal sources via enzymatic and non-enzymatic reactions [ 13, 14].
4: Many enzymes play an essential role in oxidative stress formation.
5: These enzymes include xanthine oxidase (XO), P450 complex, NADPH oxidase (NOX), uncoupled endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), arachidonic acid (AA), lipoxygenase, peroxisomes and cyclooxygenase (COX) [ 11, 13].
6: On the other hand, superoxide radicals are non-enzymatically generated by mitochondrial respiration chain complex I (NADPHubiquinone oxidoreductase) and complex III (the ubiquinolcytochrome c oxidoreductase) [ 11, 13].
7: Complex III mediates ROS production which has significant effect in cancer development and progression [ 11].
8: Clearly, ROS interact and oxidize many cellular constituents involving proteins, lipids and nucleic acids followed reversibly or irreversibly with changes in the structure and the function of these molecules [ 15].
9: On the other side, inducible NOS produces significant amounts of RNS which play critical role in the induction of lipid peroxidation and consequently the production of other reactive species, like reactive aldehydes-malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) [ 12].
