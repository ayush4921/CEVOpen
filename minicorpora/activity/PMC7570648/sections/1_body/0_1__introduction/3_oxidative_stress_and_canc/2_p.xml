<p>In our body, redox homeostasis balances the oxidative stress via enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants. Several types of antioxidants have critical roles in ROS elimination, including dietary natural antioxidants, like tocopherol, selenium, β-carotene, ascorbic acid, polyphenol metabolites, and synthetic antioxidants (e.g., N-acetylcysteine). On the contrary, many endogenous antioxidant molecules contribute in this role, such as glutathione, α-lipoic acid, coenzyme Q, ferritin, uric acid, bilirubin, metallothionein, L-carnitine, and melatonin. Endogenous antioxidant enzymes are also involved in balancing the oxidative stress. These enzymes include superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione reductase (Gr), thioredoxin reductase (TRX), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidases (GPXs) and peroxiredoxins (PRXs) [
