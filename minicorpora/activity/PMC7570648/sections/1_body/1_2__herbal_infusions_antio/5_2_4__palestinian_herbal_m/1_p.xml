<p>The Palestinian herbal infusion contains green tea, lemon verbena, sage, and citrus lemon. Green tea (
 <italic>Camellia Sinensis</italic>) belongs to the Theaceae family and it is widely consumed in Asian countries [

 <xref rid="B63-molecules-25-04207" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Moreover, other components exist, including, flavones, phenolic acids, and depsides, carbohydrates, alkaloids, minerals, vitamins, and enzymes [

Various studies have confirmed that polyphenols and tea catechins are exceptional electron donors and efficient scavengers of physiologically-relevant ROS in vitro, including superoxide anions [

 <xref rid="B66-molecules-25-04207" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], which is listed as an antioxidant. Epigallocatechin 3-gallate exerts its beneficial biological actions directly by interacting with proteins and phospholipids in the plasma membrane and regulating signal transduction pathways, transcription factors, DNA methylation, mitochondrial function, and autophagy [

The dietary green tea polyphenol has a potentiating impact on cisplatin anti-tumor activity and a protective influence against cisplatin-induced renal dysfunction. It is suggested that green tea polyphenol may be used with cisplatin as a modulator in anticancer treatment [

Interestingly, the grape extracts work synergistically with decaffeinated green tea extracts in the prevention of the activity of tumor-associated NADH oxidase (tNOX) and the prevention of cancer cell growth. Intra-tumoral injections of 25:1 mixture of the green tea extract and ground freeze-dried pomace were effective in repressing the growth of 4T1 mammary tumors in mice [
