<p>Lemon verbena (
 <italic>Lippia citriodora</italic>) belongs to the Verbenaceae family. It is a shrub with scented leaves that grows in both tropical and subtropical regions [
 <xref rid="B72-molecules-25-04207" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Chemical composition of lemon verbena showed that it is composed of large amounts of polyphenolic compounds including verbascoside (400 mg/L) and luteolin 7-diglucuronide (100 mg/L). It also contains 42 mg/L of essential oil with much more citral (77% of the essential oil) [

 <italic>Lippia citriodora</italic> protected against lipid peroxidation and protein carbonylation. Also, the decoction showed higher antioxidant capacity compared to the infusion [
 <xref rid="B74-molecules-25-04207" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Leaf infusion of lemon verbena worked as a free radical scavenger and exhibited an antigenotoxic activity by increasing the antioxidant status [
 <xref rid="B75-molecules-25-04207" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. In a clinical trial including 43 healthy subjects, lemon verbena leaves induced oxidant/antioxidant balance by causing a reduction in the lipid peroxidation and an increase in the total antioxidant ability [
 <xref rid="B76-molecules-25-04207" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Lemon verbena essential oil showed high antiproliferative activity against a panel of human cancer cell lines (A375 &gt; Caco2 &gt; HepG2 &gt; MCF-7 &gt; THP-1). Citral or geranial is the main component in the essential oil of lemon verbena, and while it has strong anticancer and antimicrobial properties, it has weak direct antioxidant activities [
 <xref rid="B77-molecules-25-04207" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Lemon verbena is also rich with luteolin, which is a flavone bioflavonoid and has anticancer properties. It induces apoptotic cell death, inhibits the proliferation of cancer cells, and inhibits tumor angiogenesis [
