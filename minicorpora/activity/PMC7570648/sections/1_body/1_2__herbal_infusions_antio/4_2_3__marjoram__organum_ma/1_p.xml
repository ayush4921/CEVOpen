 <italic>Organum majorana</italic> belongs to the Lamiaceae family. Marjoram is a shrub and a perennial plant native in Asia and the Mediterranean area. It has been used traditionally in the folk medicine as an antifungal, antiviral, and antiparasitic remedy [

The marjoram water extract plays an important role in the initiation of apoptosis by inducing DNA damage in human colon cancer HT-29 cells and down-regulation of survivin (inhibitor of apoptosis) and the activation of caspases, in human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells [
 <xref rid="B58-molecules-25-04207" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Supporting this finding, the essential oil of marjoram showed cytotoxic anti-cancer effect against the HT29 and Caco-2 colon cancer cell lines, partially through the down-regulation of survivin [

The pure essential oil of marjoram was also shown to cause a concentration- and time-dependent reduction in the proliferation of the lung cancer cells (A549 and LNM35) and the growth of their relevant colonies in vitro. Likewise, treatment with marjoram significantly reduced the growth of LNM35 and A549 xenografts in the chick embryo and in nude mice models in vivo without notable side effects [

Moreover, the highest phenolic contents and antioxidant actions of the marjoram water extract lead to the upregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 (p21), leading to apoptosis and suppression of the cell cycle in the breast cancer MCF-7 cell line [
