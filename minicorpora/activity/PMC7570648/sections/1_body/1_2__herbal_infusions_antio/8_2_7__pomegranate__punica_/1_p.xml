<p>Pomegranate (
 <italic>Punica granatum</italic> L.) is a member of the Punicaceae family and is considered to be of Middle East origin. The plant has also been used in the traditional medicine for ages [
 <xref rid="B134-molecules-25-04207" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>]. 
 <italic>P. granatum</italic> is a good source of phenolic compounds and anthocyanins, as demonstrated in a previous study [
 <xref rid="B135-molecules-25-04207" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>]. A preliminary phytochemical screening has revealed the presence of different phytochemicals from ethanolic, aqueous, and chloroform extracts of pomegranate peel, whole fruit, and seeds. The extracts of the entire fruit contained the majority of the phytocompounds represented by triterpenoids, steroids, glycosides, saponins, alkaloids, flavonoids, tannins, carbohydrates, and vitamin C.

 <italic>P. granatum</italic> peels ethanolic extract has been analyzed using GC-MS chromatography and showed various constituents with antioxidant activity such as decahydro-1-pentadactyl- naphthalene, 5-hydroxymethyl furfural and 1, 3-cyclohexadiene [

 <italic>P. granatum</italic>—hydroalcoholic and infusion—exhibited high efficiency in inhibiting DPPH radical and had significant reducing power of the Fe
 <sup>3+</sup>/ferricyanide complex. The antioxidant activity of fruit peel extracts has been justified by the presence of a high level of phenolic compounds like ellagic acid and its derivatives, as identified by UPLC-PDA-MS analysis [

 <italic>P. granatum</italic> and has shown that the TPC and total flavonoids content (TFC) of arils juices were about 20- and 300-fold inferior to decoctions. Regardless of variety, each decoction revealed better antioxidant and chelating activity compared to the juices [
 <xref rid="B139-molecules-25-04207" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>]. The antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>P. granatum</italic> peel was assessed using three aqueous extraction techniques; continuous shaking extraction, maceration, and hot water infusion. It was found that infusion method resulted in significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) level of antioxidant activity compared to other extraction techniques [
 <xref rid="B140-molecules-25-04207" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>]. Since 
 <italic>P. granatum</italic> has an impact on ROS, an in vivo study was carried out to test the effect of methanolic extracts of pomegranate seeds and peel on oxidative stress induced by methotrexate. The results have demonstrated a significant reduction in GPX and SOD, and an improvement in MDA values after methotrexate treatment [
