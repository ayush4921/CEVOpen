<p>In vivo, rosemary polyphenols have antiproliferative effects against colon cancer cells in animal models. For example, when male nude mice were grafted with human colon cancer cells (HT-29) treated with fluid extract of rosemary, the extract exhibited a clear reduction in the tumor size. This outcome was strongly correlated with the role of rosemary extract in sharp increase of intracellular ROS that stimulated necrotic cell death. In addition, Nrf2 gene silencing increased rosemary cytotoxic effects [

Another study revealed that administration of 200 mg/kg of rosemary extract per day in mice leads to the reduction in the progression of colorectal cancer HT-29 cells. This is attributed to the alteration in RNA post-transcriptional modification, protein synthesis and the amino acid metabolism which are responsible for tumor reduction. For example, rosemary extract altered nucleic acid binding capacity, followed by enzyme modulator proteins, hydrolases, cytoskeletal proteins, oxidoreductases and transferases [
