<p>Roselle (
 <italic>Hibiscus sabdariffa</italic> L.) is a well-known species that belongs to the Malvaceae family. The plant is an annual or perennial herb found in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. It is used to produce phloem fibers and as an infusion (herbal tea) [

 <xref rid="B119-molecules-25-04207" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. A preliminary phytochemical analysis has shown the presence of alkaloids, tannins, saponins, glycosides, phenols, and flavonoids in different solvent extracts of 
 <italic>H. sabdariffa</italic> [
 <xref rid="B120-molecules-25-04207" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. Studies have also shown that calyces of 
 <italic>H. sabdariffa</italic> contained alkaloids, flavonoids, saponins, tannins, and a high anthocyanin content with the lowest flavonoids and phenolic acid [
 <xref rid="B121-molecules-25-04207" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis has identified 18 volatile components in the calyx of 
 <italic>H. sabdariffa</italic>, most of which were fatty acids and ester compounds [
 <xref rid="B122-molecules-25-04207" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. Ethanimidic acid and its ethyl ester (31%) were the major phytocompounds detected in the methanol extract of hibiscus flowers, which are reported to possess antioxidant and cancer-preventive properties [
 <xref rid="B123-molecules-25-04207" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]. A previous study has reported the presence of anthocyanins in 
 <italic>H. sabdariffa</italic> calyces in two major forms; delphinidine-3-sambubioside and cyanidine-3-sambubioside [
 <xref rid="B124-molecules-25-04207" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. The relation between total anthocyanin content (TAC) and antioxidant activity of hibiscus infusion has been investigated and revealed that under optimum conditions (10 g/mL, 88.7 °C and 15.5 min), TAC was 132.7 ± 7.8 mg and antioxidant activity was high according to DPPH and ABTS assays [
 <xref rid="B125-molecules-25-04207" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. The antioxidant effect of anthocyanins is due to their phenolic structure that has the ability to scavenge ROS [
 <xref rid="B126-molecules-25-04207" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>]. Extraction conditions, like temperature, extraction time, and solid to solvent ratio, affect the antioxidant activities of 
 <italic>H. sabdariffa</italic>, which tends to be high when the extraction temperature is in the range of 70–80 °C and the extraction time is from 120 to 150 min. At the same time, it decreases as the solvent to solid ratio is increased [
 <xref rid="B127-molecules-25-04207" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>]. Furthermore, bound soluble phenolic compounds in 
 <italic>H. sabdariffa</italic> extracts and their impact on antioxidant activity have been investigated and have shown that the highest total phenolic content (TPC) resulted in high antioxidant scavenging capacity [
 <xref rid="B128-molecules-25-04207" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>]. In a later study, 
 <italic>H. sabdariffa</italic> aqueous extract exhibited a higher ability to scavenge peroxyl radicals in the water environment than in the lipophilic system and exhibited a more potent metal-reducing activity than olive leaf extract [
