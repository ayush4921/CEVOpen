 <xref rid="B157-molecules-25-04207" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>]. It is originated from Egypt, Turkistan, Iran, and Eastern Mediterranean [
 <xref rid="B158-molecules-25-04207" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>]. The bioactive phytochemicals found in cumin seeds are associated with their various industrial applications that range from food to pharmaceutical products [
 <xref rid="B157-molecules-25-04207" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>]. Phytochemical analysis of 
 <italic>C. cyminum</italic> has revealed the presence of alkaloids, anthraquinones, coumarins, flavonoids, glycosides, resins, saponins, tannins and steroids [
 <xref rid="B159-molecules-25-04207" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>]. Cumin seed essential oil has been analyzed using GC-MS analysis and the presence of 18 compounds demonstrated, with 3-caren-10-al and cuminal being the main constituents [
 <xref rid="B160-molecules-25-04207" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>]. A previous study has investigated the antioxidant activity of alcoholic and aqueous extracts of cumin seeds. Results have shown that the alcoholic extract had higher activity comparing to the aqueous extract [
 <xref rid="B161-molecules-25-04207" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>]. It was found that alcoholic extracts of 
 <italic>C. cyminum</italic> have a higher phenolic content and antioxidant capacity comparing to coriander extracts [
 <xref rid="B162-molecules-25-04207" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>]. Cumin seed aqueous extract was able to protect WRL-68 cells from hexavalent chromium-induced oxidative injury via reducing ROS in dose-dependent manner. The antioxidant potential of the cumin seed extract is positively correlated with the high content of phenolic acid [
