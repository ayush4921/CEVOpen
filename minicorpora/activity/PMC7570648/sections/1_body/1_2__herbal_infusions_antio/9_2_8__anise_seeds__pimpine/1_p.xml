 <xref rid="B147-molecules-25-04207" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>]. It is widely used as a flavoring agent and as a primary ingredient in herbal infusions [
 <xref rid="B148-molecules-25-04207" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>]. A recent study was conducted to evaluate the antioxidant potentials of Portuguese 
 <italic>P. anisum</italic> seeds infusion. The results of this study have detected high content of flavonoids, phenols, and anthocyanins. These bioactive components reflected the high antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>P. anisum</italic> against free radicals [
 <xref rid="B149-molecules-25-04207" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>]. Use of a combination of anion-exchange, gel filtration, and hydrophobic interaction column chromatographies facilitated the isolation of three lignin-carbohydrate protein complexes from a hot water extract of the seeds of 
 <italic>P. anisum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B150-molecules-25-04207" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>]. The results of GS-MS analysis of 
 <italic>P. anisum</italic> infusion have shown the presence of fatty acids (linoleic, oleic, and palmitic acids), triterpenoids (lupeol, β-amyrin and betulinic acids), and sterols (β-sitosterol and stigmasterol) [
