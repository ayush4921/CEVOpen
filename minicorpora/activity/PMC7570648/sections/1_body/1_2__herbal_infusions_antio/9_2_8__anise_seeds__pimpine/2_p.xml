<p>A previous study has demonstrated the correlation between total phenolic content and antioxidant activity of both anise and cumin infusions (ground form). It was found that phenolic compounds in these infusions are the main contributors to their free radical-scavenging activity and oxidant reduction potency [

The extracts exhibited significant antioxidant activity in both linoleic acid and liposome model systems, however the water extract showed higher activity comparing to alcohol extracts [
