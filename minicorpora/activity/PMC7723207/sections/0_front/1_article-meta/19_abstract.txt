0: AbstractThe in vitro antioxidant and antidiabetic activities of   Oliveria decumbens,   Thymus kotschyanus,   Trachyspermum ammi, and   Zataria multiflora essential oils incorporated into gelatinpectin composite were investigated.
1: The gas chromatographymass spectrometry characterization revealed that thymol (1.2%86.4%), carvacrol (3.2%52.4%), gammaterpinene (0.0%12.7%), paracymene (3.2%5.2%), geraniol (0.0%14.5%), and spathulenol (0.0%13.6%) are the major constituents of the essential oils.
2: Gelatinpectin composite incorporated with the essential oils exhibited acidic pH (2.403.04), low conductivity (265278 S/cm), low surface tension (19.023.5 mN/m), low Newtonian viscosity (23.728.5 mPa.s), negative zetapotential (14.216.9 mV), and nanoscale particle size (313336 nm).
3: These rheological properties result in the production of globular gelatinpectin nanoparticles with a size range of 500700 nm.
4: The FTIR spectra of gelatinpectin and gelatinpectinessential oils to some extent were similar, suggesting the noncovalent interactions between them.
5: Gelatinpectin composite incorporated with the essential oils displayed antiglucose oxidation (130150 g/ml) antilipid peroxidation (120130 g/ml), antiprotein oxidation (150168 g/ml), and antiprotein glycation (145170 g/ml) as well as antiamylase (216230 g/ml), and antiglucosidase (212238 g/ml) activity.
6: The essential oils strongly improved the antioxidant capacity of the gelatinpectin composite so strongly which can be recommended as a natural compound for oxidative stress management.
