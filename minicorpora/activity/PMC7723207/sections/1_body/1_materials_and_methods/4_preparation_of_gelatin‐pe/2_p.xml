<p>Electrospraying of the gelatin‐pectin solutions was carried out by full option electrospinning machine 5 (Full Option Lab2 ESII‐II, Nano Azma, Iran). Stainless steel needle was used as nozzle and a thin aluminum sheet used as the collector. The needle was connected to the positive polarity electrode of the high‐voltage power supply. The collector was attached to the grounding electrode. Gelatin‐pectin composite nanoparticles were fabricated by electrospraying diluted gelatin‐pectin solution under a fixed electrostatic field strength of 10 kV at a fixed length of 10 cm over a fixed collection time (10 min) with a feed rate of 0.3 ml/h. After coating with gold, the magnified images of the nanoparticles were recorded with a Tescan‐Vega3 scanning electron microscope (Tescan, Czech). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy of nanoparticles was carried out using Bruker FTIR (Germany) in the range between 4,000 and 400 cm
