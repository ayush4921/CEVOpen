<p>Thirty microliters of different concentrations of essential oils were incubated with 1,000 µl of LDL solution (1.0 mg/ml in phosphate‐buffered saline (PBS)). Instantly, 1,000 µl cupric sulfate (10 µM in PBS) as an oxidizing agent was added and kept at ambient temperature for 12h. The percent light absorbance reduction at 234 nm was taken as the percent of lipid peroxidation inhibition as follows: percent inhibition = [(Absorbance in the absence of essential oil − Absorbance in the presence of essential oil)]/Absorbance in the absence of essential oil × 100. Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT, 10 mg/ml) was used as control (Amarowicz &amp; Pegg,
