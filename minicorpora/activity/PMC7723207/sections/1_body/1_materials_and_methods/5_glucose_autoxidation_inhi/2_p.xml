<p>Thirty microliters of different concentrations of essential oil particles (50, 100, 200, 300, and 400 µg/ml) were incubated with reaction solution containing sodium benzoate (1 mM), glucose (500 mM), and copper (II) sulfate (100 µM) at ambient temperature for 4 days. The fluorescence intensity of the solutions was read at 310 nm (excitation) and at 410 nm (emission). The percentage reduction in fluorescence intensity was taken as the percentage inhibition in glucose oxidation as follows: percent inhibition = [(fluorescence intensity in the absence of essential oil—fluorescence intensity in the presence of essential oil)]/fluorescence intensity in the absence of essential oil × 100. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA, 1.0 mM) was used as a positive control (Hunt et al.,
