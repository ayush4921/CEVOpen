<p>Thirty microliters of different concentrated essential oils were added to 5.0 µl pancreatic amylase solution and incubated for 10 min at ambient temperature. The reaction catalyzed by amylase was immediately initiated by adding 20 µl starch solution (1.0 mg/ml) and incubated for 30 min at ambient temperature. The enzyme reaction was terminated by adding 20 µl HCl (1.0 M) to each well. Then, 100 µl of iodine reagent was added to each well. The absorbance of each solution in well was recorded at 580 nm, and the percentage of enzyme inhibition was observed as follows: percent inhibition − [(Absorbance in the absence of essential oil − Absorbance in the presence of essential oil)]/Absorbance in absence of the essential oil × 100. Acarbose (10 µg/ml) was used as control (Majeed et al.,
