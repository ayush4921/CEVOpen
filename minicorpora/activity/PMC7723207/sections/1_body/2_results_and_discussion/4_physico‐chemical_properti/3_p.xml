 <italic>SEM</italic> images of the electrospray‐gelatin‐pectin particles incorporated with the essential oils revealed that the particles had a size range of 300–600 nm and are globular in the shape (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31935-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The particle sizes were higher than those estimated by LDS. This indicates that in electrospray and solvent evaporation, some particles have been attached to each other. The morphology of the nanoparticles has a significant impact on the uptake and transport of nanoparticles in the biological system (Baldino et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31935-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). Gelatin‐pectin‐essential oil nanoparticles have a spherical shape and are well dispersed. The globular shape of nanoparticles makes them the most capable of controlled release and protects the payloads because the spherical shape has the longest path to the movement of the entrapped extract in the nanoparticles and also the lowest contact area with the dispersed phase aqueous medium compared to other forms of nanoparticles (Loepfe et al.,
