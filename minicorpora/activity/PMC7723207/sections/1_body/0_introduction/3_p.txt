0: Medicinal plants are excellent sources and producers of polyphenols, flavonoids, polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega3), functional amines, polypeptides, and other effective chemicals (Salehi et al.,  2019).
1: Among these phytochemicals, volatile oils are a mixture of lipophilic compounds, such as phenolic, terpenes, terpenoids, aliphatic alcohols, aldehyde, ketones, and flavonoids, all possessing numerous medicinal properties.
2: The important properties of the volatile oils such as antimicrobials, antioxidants, and antiinflammatory have been proven (ElSaber Batiha et al.,  2020).
3: The volatile oils are insoluble in water and are easily degraded by extreme acidity, light, and high temperature which limit their applications in the food and pharmaceutical industries (RibeiroSantos et al.,  2018).
4: Encapsulation of volatile oils in natural proteins and carbohydrate polymers or in lipid droplets could decrease the volatility, increase solubility, and improve the stability and efficiency of these valuable phytocompounds (Bakry et al.,  2016).
