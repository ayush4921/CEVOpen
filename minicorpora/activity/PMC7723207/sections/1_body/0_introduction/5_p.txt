0: Present study is focused on the chemical characterization of the volatile oils extracted from  O. decumbens (ODEO),  T. ammi (TAEO),  Z. multiflora (ZMEO), and  T. kotschyanus (TKEO).
1: The essential oils were encapsulated in the gelationcomposite solution.
2: The rheological properties of the gelatinpectinessential oils composite solutions were then studied.
3: The gelatinpectinessential oil particles were prepared by electrospray and the morphology of the particles analyzed by scanning electron microscope.
4: The in vitro antioxidant and antidiabetic capacities of the gelationpectin composite particles against glucose oxidation, lipid peroxidation, protein peroxidation, protein glycation, amylase, and glucosidase were analyzed.
