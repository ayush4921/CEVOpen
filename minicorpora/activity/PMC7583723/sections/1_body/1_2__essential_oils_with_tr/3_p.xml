<p>Administration routes for parasitemia-inducing forms and blood collection for evaluation were by intraperitoneal (i.p.) and tail vein (c.d.) routes, respectively. The route of administration for essential oils was oral gavage (p.o.). In 15.5% of cases, parasitemia was evaluated through blood samples and stained using a panoptic method, while hematoxylin and eosin (HE) was used in 26.3% of cases. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy was used for 10% of cases, while measurement with a Neubauer camera was used in 25.3% of cases. ELISA was used for 15.3% of cases with an absorbance wavelength of 492â€“600 nm.</p>
