<p>Pereira et al. (2018) [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-25-04568" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] verified the leishmanicidal and anti-
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> potential as well as the cytotoxicity of the 
 <italic>Alpinia speciosa</italic> K. Schum. essential oil. 
 <italic>A. speciosa</italic> presented 1,8-cineole (28.46%), camphor (17.10%) and sabinene (9.95%) as the main constituents. The cytotoxic activity of the essential oil showed a low value, while the antipromastigote and antiepimastigote activities showed values that were considered clinically relevant, with values below 500 Î¼g/mL.
