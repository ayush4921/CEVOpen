<p>Bay et al. [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-25-04568" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] investigated the trypanocidal activity of the essential oils of four species of Annonaceae (
 <italic>Bocageopsis multiflora</italic>, 
 <italic>Duguetia quitarensis</italic>, 
 <italic>Fusaea longifolia</italic> and 
 <italic>Guatteria punctata</italic>) against trypomastigote and intracellular amastigote forms of 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic>. The trypanocidal action results indicated that the essential oils were active, and that the essential oil of 
 <italic>G. punctata</italic> was the most active (the main constituents for this oil were germacrene D, (
 <italic>E</italic>)-nerolidol and (
 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene), with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.029 μg/mL, which presented the highest selectivity index (SI) and was 34 times more effective than benznidazole (1 μg/mL).
