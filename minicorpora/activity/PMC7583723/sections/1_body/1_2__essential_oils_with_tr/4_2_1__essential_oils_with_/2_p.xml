<p>Barros et al. (2016) [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-25-04568" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] highlighted the in vitro trypanocidal activity of the 
 <italic>Lantana camara</italic> L. essential oil against 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> at a concentration of 291.94 Âµg/mL dissolved in DMSO. Analysis of the essential oil of the species revealed that (
 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene and bicyclogermacrene represent the principal components of this oil. Thus, (
 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene may be partly responsible for the trypanocidal activity of the species. The study also highlighted that other chemical compounds in this species may present activity against 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> [
