 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> at concentrations below 30 and 15 Î¼g/mL, respectively. Analysis of the essential oils of both species revealed very similar chemical compositions, differing in the concentration of some constituents, yet the main components of both were bicyclogermacrene, (
 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene and germacrene D. The trypanocidal activity was attributed to the high concentration of these components. Recent work has demonstrated the trypanocidal properties of these constituents [
