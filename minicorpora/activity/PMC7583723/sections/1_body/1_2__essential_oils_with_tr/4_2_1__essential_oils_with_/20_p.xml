<p>Estevam et al. (2017) [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-25-04568" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] investigated the trypanocidal activity of the EO of 
 <italic>Protium ovatum</italic> Engl. against 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> trypomastigotes (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 28.55 μg/mL). The main compounds found in the EO were spathulenol, caryophylene oxide, β-caryophylene, and myrcene. However, the EO demonstrated moderate cytotoxicity against LLCMK
 <sub>2</sub> adherent epithelial cells (CC
 <sub>50</sub> = 150.9 μg/mL).
