<p>Zanusso Júnior et al. (2018) [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-25-04568" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] investigated the activity of the EO of 
 <italic>Syzygium aromaticum</italic> (main compounds are eugenol and β-caryophyllene) alone and in association with benznidazole (BZ) in mice infected with 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> AM14 strain (TcIV) (considered resistant to BZ 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>). When compared to untreated animals, experiments with the EO of 
 <italic>S. aromaticum</italic> alone promoted a reduction of the parasitemia. However, the animals treated with BZ alone or in association showed a more significant reduction in parasitemia.
