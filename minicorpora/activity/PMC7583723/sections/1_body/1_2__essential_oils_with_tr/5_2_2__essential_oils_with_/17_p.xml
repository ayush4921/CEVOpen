<p>Tasdemir et al. (2019) [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-25-04568" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] also evaluated the in vitro activity of the essential oil of 
 <italic>Origanum onites</italic> L. turco and its main constituents against 
 <italic>T. brucei rhodesiense</italic>. The oil showed significant in vitro activity against 
 <italic>T. brucei rhodesiense</italic> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 180 ng/mL) without causing toxicity in mammalian cells. In the in vivo model against 
 <italic>T. brucei brucei</italic>, thymol extended the animals survival.
