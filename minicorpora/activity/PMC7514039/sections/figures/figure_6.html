 <caption> Activity key enzymes involved in the shikimic acid and cinnamic acid pathways. Activity of 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase (DAHPS) (A), phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) (B), cinnamate-4-hydroxylase (C4H) (C), 4-coumarate:CoA ligase (4CL) (D) in different tissues of A. heterotropoides var. mandshuricum grown in four light irradiations. I, 100% full sunlight; II, 50% full sunlight; III, 24% full sunlight; IV, 12% full sunlight. Error bar represents standard deviation (n = 5); different letters on the bars mean significant difference ( P &lt;0.05). </caption>
