0: The essential oil derived from  A.  heterotropoides var.
1: mandshuricum is mainly composed of phenylpropanoid compounds, including benzene, 1,2-dimethoxy-4-(2-propenyl)-, 1,3-Benzodioxole,5-(2-propenyl)- and 1,3-benzodioxole, 4-methoxy-6-(2-propenyl) [ 5,  6].
2: Phenylpropanoid biosynthesis is derived from the shikimic acid and cinnamic acid pathways [ 7] ( Fig 1).
3: Shikimic acid provides the seven carbon skeleton and L-phenylalanine is the phenylpropenes initial precursor.
4: 3-Deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase (DAHPS) is one of the key enzymes in aromatic amino acid biosynthesis because it catalyzes an aldol condensation of the glycolytic intermediate phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP) and pentose phosphate pathway intermediate erythrose-4-phosphate (E4P) to a seven-carbon six-membered heterocyclic compound (3-dexoy-D-arabinoheptulosonate-7-phosphate (DAHP)) which is the first enzymatic step in the shikimic acid pathway [ 6 8].
5: Chorismate mutase (CM) catalyzes the step of phenylalanine biosynthesis and additionally represents a key hinge toward the branch of phenylalanine biosynthesis.
6: Subsequently, phenylalanine is catalyzed by the well-known phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) to cinnamic acid [ 9].
7: This is followed by the formation of  p-coumaric acid from cinnamic acid.
8: These reactions involve the cinnamate-4-hydroxylase (C4H) and 4-coumarate:CoA ligase (4CL).
9: In subsequent reactions, the derivatives phenylpropenes such as eugenol, methyleugenol, safrole are synthesized [ 10].
10: DAHPS, CM, PAL, C4H and 4CL are therefore the key enzymes catalyzing the biosynthesis of phenylpropene precursors.
11: Similarly, cinnamic acid and  p-coumaric acid are crucial secondary metabolites for the biosynthesis of essential oil in  A.  heterotropoides var.
12: mandshuricum.
