0: Skiophytic plants grow in moist and shaded areas and their photosynthesis is adapted to low illumination [ 11].
1: Skyiophytes have shown optimal growth at light intensities between 200300 mol photons m -2 s -1 or 1015% of full sunlight.
2: At light intensities greater than 500 mol photons m -2 s -1, photoinhibitory symptoms have been reported, including a decrease in the rate of photosynthesis [ 12].
3: In order to improve the bio-yield and active ingredient content of herbs, economic and effective actions should be carried out during planting according to plant characteristics such as adjusting light intensities [ 13 16].
4: The effects of light irradiation levels on essential oil yield and composition in plants such as sage and basil have been well documented.
5: Shading strongly reduced the total essential oil content of basil and inhibited the accumulation of eugenol, linalool and 1,8-cineole [ 13].
6: However, moderate shading (45% full sunlight) promoted sage highest essential oil content while full sunlight benefited the biosynthesis of myrcene [ 17].
7: Some researchers suggested that shading leads to reduced essential oil content [ 18], but less attention has been paid to the relation of light irradiation and essential oil composition and precursor metabolites.
8: In addition, how skiophyte plants respond to high light levels with regard to the biosynthesis of essential oil has been less explored.
9: This study was conducted to investigate the effects of light irradiation on photosynthesis and essential oil accumulation and composition in the skiophyte plant  A.  heterotropoides var.
