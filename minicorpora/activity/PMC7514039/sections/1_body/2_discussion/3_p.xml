<p>Significant positive correlations between available PAR, LMA, Pn, essential oil content and key precursor metabolites indicate that high carbon assimilation of

 <italic>heterotropoides</italic> var. 
 <italic>mandshuricum</italic> in 100% full sunlight stimulates biosynthesis and accumulation of precursor metabolites and essential oil yield. Biosynthesis of secondary metabolites is influenced not only by the amount of original carbon skeleton substance but also by the activities of related enzymes. In this study, we found that strong light irradiations increased the activity levels of DAHPS, PAL, C4H and 4CL. In agreement with our results, numerous studies also showed pronounced induction of the activity levels of these enzymes with increasing light irradiation in various plants [
