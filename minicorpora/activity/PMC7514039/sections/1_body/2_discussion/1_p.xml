<p>Leaf mass per area (LMA) is one of the best predictors for light interception in plant [

 <xref rid="pone.0237952.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In this study, the LMA values increased with increasing light irradiation. This means that leaves of 
 <italic>Asarum heterotropoides</italic> var. 
 <italic>mandshuricum</italic> plants grown in high light conditions can intercept and absorb more light and assimilate more CO
 <sub>2</sub> than leaves of plants grown in low light conditions. The net photosynthetic rate (Pn) is known to be an indicator of the light reaction and carbon assimilation [
