<p>Essential oil content in many plants is influenced by abiotic factors such as light irradiation [

 <xref rid="pone.0237952.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Some of these studies focused on the influence of light intensity on the concentration of plant volatile oils [
 <xref rid="pone.0237952.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0237952.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Duriyaprapan et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0237952.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] reported that solar radiation did not influence volatile oil yield and its important components in Japanese mint (
 <italic>Mentha arvensis</italic> L. subsp. haplocalyx Briquet var. piperascens Holmes). Larissa et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0237952.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] showed that light treatment did not alter the volatile oil yield of 
 <italic>Ocimum selloi</italic> Benth. Letchamo et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0237952.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] reported that supplemental light could enhance the volatile oil yield of 
 <italic>Angelica archangelica</italic>. In our study, the highest essential oil content was obtained in roots of plants grown in 100% full sunlight, confirming that high light irradiation promotes the synthesis of essential oil in 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>heterotropoides</italic> var. 
 <italic>mandshuricum</italic>. In addition, we showed that the essential oil composition in 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>heterotropoides</italic> var. 
 <italic>mandshuricum</italic> was profoundly changed according to the light intensity. Some reports indicated that higher content of terpenoids such as pinene, camphene, 1,8-cineole, trans-caryophyllene is induced by moderate light irradiation [
 <xref rid="pone.0237952.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0237952.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In this study, we also found that the amounts of terpenoids were largest in 50% full sunlight grown 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>heterotropoides</italic> var. 
 <italic>mandshuricum</italic>. On the other hand, the highest contents of typical phenylpropanoid compounds were obtained in 100% full sunlight in this study. This result indicates that stronger light irradiations promote biosynthesis of phenylpropanoids in 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>heterotropoides</italic> var. 
 <italic>mandshuricum</italic>, which is in accordance with reports of Cheng et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0237952.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Since phenylpropanoid compounds account for more than 70% of the total essential oil in 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>heterotropoides</italic> var. 
 <italic>mandshuricum</italic>, we infer that the highest essential oil content obtained in roots of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>heterotropoides</italic> var. 
 <italic>mandshuricum</italic> grown in 100% full sunlight is due to a strong biosynthesis of phenylpropanoids. This observation was further supported by the fact that key upstream molecules involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway (phenylalanine, cinnamic acid and 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid) were all visibly promoted by strong light irradiations. Hence, specific light treatments could be applied to 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>heterotropoides</italic> var. 
 <italic>mandshuricum</italic> in order to obtain essential oil enriched with targeted bioactive molecules.
