<p>After harvesting, plant materials were oven-dried at 40°C and ground to fine powder for measuring contents of shikimic acid, phenylalanine, cinnamic acid and 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid. Extracts of materials were prepared according to the methods described by Elzaawely et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0237952.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] with some modifications. About 5 g of samples were boiled in 50 mL distilled water for 55 min. After cooling at room temperature, the water extracts from samples were filtered and extracted with hexane (3×50 mL). One part of the aqueous solutions after extraction with hexane was hydrolyzed with 25 mL 4 M NaOH at 50°C by stirring for 4 h. The suspensions were separately filtered and pH was adjusted to 2.0 by 4 M HCL. Afterwards, the filtrates were separately extracted with ethylacetate (3×50 mL) and then filtered. The ethylacetate extracts were separately dried under vacuum at 40°C. The other part of the aqueous solutions after extraction with hexane remained as the aqueous phase. The aqueous phase and ethylacetate phase dissolved with methanol (Fisher, chromatography grade) were subjected to HPLC-MS/MS analysis.
