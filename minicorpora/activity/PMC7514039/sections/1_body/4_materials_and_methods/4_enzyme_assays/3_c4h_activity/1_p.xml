<p>C4H activity was assayed as described by Gao et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0237952.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] with some modifications. Fresh leaves frozen with liquid nitrogen were homogenized on ice in 3 mL pre-cooled 0.05 M Tris-HCL buffer (pH = 8.9), 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 15 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 μM leupeptin, 5 mM vitamin C, 0.15% polyvinylpyrrolidone (m/v) 4 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 10% glycerinum. The homogenate was kept at 4°C for 30 min and then centrifuged at 12000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was used for the assay. The assay mixture contained 0.8 mL extract and 2.2 mL of 0.05 M Tris-HCL buffer (pH = 8.9) containing 2 mM trans-cinnamate, 2 μM NADPNa
 <sub>2</sub>, and 5 μM Glc-6-phosphate. The mixtures were incubated at 25°C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 100 μL of 6 N HCL. Reaction mixtures without enzyme were run in parallel and used as controls. The reaction was then followed by monitoring the absorbance of the product, 4-hydroxy-trans-cinnamic acid at 340 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 22600 M
 <sup>−1</sup> cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. One unit of activity indicates deamination of 1.0 nmol product per min.
