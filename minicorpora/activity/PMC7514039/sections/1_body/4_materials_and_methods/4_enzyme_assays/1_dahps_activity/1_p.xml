<p>DAHPS activity was assayed as described by Li et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0237952.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] with some modifications. Fresh leaves frozen with liquid nitrogen were homogenized with a mortar and a pestle on ice in 3 mL pre-cooled 50 mM Tris-HCL buffer (pH = 7.4) containing 1.4 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mM phenylmethysulfonyl fluoride, 1% polyvinylpyrrolidone (M/V), and 10 μM leupeptin. The homogenate was kept at 4°C for 30 min and then centrifuged at 12000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was used for the assay. The assay mixture contained 0.8 mL extract and 2.2 mL of 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH = 7.5) containing 0.2 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.1 mM erythrose-4- phosphate, and 0.1 mM MnSO
 <sub>4</sub>/0.1 mM CoCl
 <sub>2</sub>. The mixtures were incubated at 30°C for 30 min. The reaction was initiated by the addition of enzyme and terminated by the addition of 500 μL of 25% (W/V) trichloroacetic acid. Reaction mixtures without enzyme were run in parallel and used as controls. One unit of activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzed the synthesis of 1 nmol of DAHPS per minute at 30°C. The concentration of DAHPS was calculated at 549 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 45000 M
