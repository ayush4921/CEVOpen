<p>PAL activity was assayed as described by Vannelli et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0237952.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] with some modifications. Fresh leaves frozen with liquid nitrogen were homogenized on ice in 3 mL pre-cooled 0.1 M sodium borate buffer (pH = 8.8) containing 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.4% polyvinylpyrrolidone (M/V). The homogenate was kept at 4°C for 30 min and then centrifuged at 12000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was used for the assay. The assay mixture contained 0.8 mL extract and 2.2 mL of 0.1 M sodium borate buffer (pH = 8.8) containing 120 μM L-Phe. The mixtures were incubated at 25°C for 40 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 120 μL of 6 N HCL. Reaction mixtures without enzyme were run in parallel and used as controls. The reaction was then followed by monitoring the absorbance of the product, trans-cinnamic acid, at 290 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 9000 M
