<p>4CL activity was assayed as described by Knobloch et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0237952.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and Lee et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0237952.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] with some modifications. Fresh leaves frozen with liquid nitrogen were homogenized on ice in 3 mL pre-cooled 0.2 M Tris-HCl (pH = 7.8), 15 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 5 mM EDTA, 10 μM leupeptin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.15% polyvinylpyrrolidone (m/v), and 30% glycerinum. The homogenate was kept at 4°C for 30 min and then centrifuged at 12000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was used for the assay. The assay mixture contained 0.8 mL extract and 2.2 mL of 0.2 M Tris-HCL buffer (pH = 7.8) containing 5 mM MgSO
 <sub>4</sub>, 5 mM ATP, 0.2 mM CoASH, and 0.2 mM 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumarate. The mixtures were incubated at 30°C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 20 μL of 20% formic acid. Reaction mixtures without enzyme were run in parallel and used as controls. The reaction was then followed by monitoring the absorbance of the product, 4-coumaroyl-CoA, at 333 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 21000 M
 <sup>−1</sup> cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. One unit of activity indicates deamination of 1.0 nmol product per minute.
