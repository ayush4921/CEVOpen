 <sup>nd</sup>, fibrous roots of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>heterotropoides</italic> var. 
 <italic>mandshuricum</italic> from the four light treatments were dried in a shaded place, ground to powder and used for essential oil extraction. About 20 g of samples were separately subjected to hydrodistillation for 3 h in accordance with Chinese Pharmacopoeia method and used to determine the yield of essential oil. 10 μL of essential oil was taken from the solution and diluted 50 times using petroleum ether. 1 μL of this diluted sample was analyzed by GC-MS. A HP-5MS highly polar capillary column (30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.25 μm, Hewlett-Packart, Palo Alto, CA, USA) coated with a 100% polyethylene glycol stationary phase was used. The following oven temperatures and times were used: 40°C (held for 2 min), raised from 40°C to 160°C at a rate of 2.5°C min
 <sup>-1</sup>, from 160°C to 280°C at a rate of 8°C min
 <sup>-1</sup> and finally held at 280°C for 10 min. The injection temperature was set at 280°C. Helium was used as the carrier gas with a flow rate of 1.0 mL min
 <sup>-1</sup>. An injection volume of 1 μL was used with a split ratio of 100:1. The mass spectrometer operated under a mode of electron impact (EI) at 70 eV with the scan ranges between 30 and 550 amu. The ion source temperature was maintained at 230°C and the quadrupole at 150°C.
