<p>We further performed a correlation analysis between light treatments, photosynthetic capacity, essential oil yield and related metabolites in 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>heterotropoides</italic> var. 
 <italic>mandshuricum</italic>. Strong and positive correlations were observed between many parameters (
 <xref rid="pone.0237952.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). There were very significant positive correlations between PAR, LMA, Pn, essential oil yield, phenylalanine, cinnamic acid and 
 <italic>ρ</italic>-coumaric acid (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). However, shikimic acid had no significant correlations with PAR, essential oil, phenylalanine and cinnamic acid. We deduced that high light treatments (high PAR) contibute to high photosynthetic activity (high Pn and LMA), which leads to high accumulation of upstream and downstream phenylpropanoid metabolites (phenylalanine, cinnamic acid and 
 <italic>ρ</italic>-coumaric acid) engaged in the biosynthesis of
