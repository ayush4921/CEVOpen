 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>heterotropoides</italic> var. 
 <italic>mandshuricum</italic> were subjected to four treatments: (I) 100%, (II) 50%, (III) 24% and (IV) 12% full sunlight. We measured the diurnal variation of photosynthesis at 18 May, 25 May and 2 June, representing expanding leaf stage, flowering stage and initial fruiting stage, respectively. To verify the effectiveness of our light treatments, we recorded at several time points the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) which is the amount of light available for photosynthesis. As shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0237952.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, PAR values in the treatments II, III and IV were respectively ~ 50, 24 and 12% of values in the treatment I. LMA is a good indicator for light interception in plant, therefore, we analyzed the LMA of plants from the four treatments [
 <xref rid="pone.0237952.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. We observed that LMA values of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>heterotropoides</italic> var. 
 <italic>mandshuricum</italic> grown in 100% full sunlight were significantly higher than those in the other three light treatments, particularly at the flowering and initial fruiting stages (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0237952.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). We further investigated the diurnal variation of photosynthesis of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>heterotropoides</italic> var. 
 <italic>mandshuricum</italic> in the four light treatments and calculated the average diurnal net photosynthetic rate (Pn). Our data indicated that the variation trends of Pn in the different light treatments were similar across the three phenological stages (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0237952.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). In addition, Pn values in 100% full sunlight were significantly higher than those in the three other light treatments. Pn values declined gradually with decreasing light irradiation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0237952.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Overall, these results suggest that increasing light intensity induces high photosynthetic capacity in leaf of
