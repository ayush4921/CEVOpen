<p>Key molecules in the essential oil of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>heterotropoides</italic> var. 
 <italic>mandshuricum</italic>. are synthesized through the shikimic acid and cinnamic acid pathways. We examined the activities of four enzymes involved in the shikimic acid and cinnamic acid pathways (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0237952.g001">Fig 1</xref>), including 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase (DAHPS), 4-coumarate:CoA ligase (4CL), cinnamate-4-hydroxylase (C4H) and phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) in the different light treatments in 
 <italic>Asarum</italic> petiole, lamina and fibrous roots (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0237952.g006">Fig 6</xref>). All enzymes were more active in aerial tissues (lamina and petiole) than root. This is understandable since sunlight is mainly percepted by aerial organs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0237952.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Furthermore, we observed a strong induction of the activity of these enzymes in higher light conditions (100 and 50% full sunlight) in the different tissues (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0237952.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Only C4H activity in petiole was stronger in low light conditions than high light conditions (
