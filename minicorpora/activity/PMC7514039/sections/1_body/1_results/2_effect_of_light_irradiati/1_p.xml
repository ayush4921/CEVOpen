<p>It has been shown that light treatments affect essential oil yield and composition in plants [

 <xref rid="pone.0237952.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. We extracted the essential oil from fibrous roots of

 <italic>heterotropoides</italic> var. 
 <italic>mandshuricum</italic> pants grown in the four light treatments and compared the yield. We observed that the essential oil yield was proportional to the light irradiation (

 <sup>-1</sup>) was obtained in fibrous roots of plants grown in 100% full sunlight, while the lowest oil yield (1.30%, mL 100 g
 <sup>-1</sup>) was obtained from fibrous roots of plants grown in 12% full sunlight (
