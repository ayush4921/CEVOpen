<p>The major phenylpropanoid compounds were 1,3-Benzodioxole,5-(2-propenyl)-, 2-Methoxy-4-vinylphenol, eugenol, Benzene,1,2-dimethoxy-4-(2-propenyl)-, 1,3-Benzodioxole,4-methoxy-6-(2-propenyl)-, 3,4-Methylenedioxypropiophenone, Benzene,1,2,3-trimethoxy-5-(2-propenyl)-, 1,2-Dimethoxy-4-(2-methoxy-1-propenyl)benzene, 2-Hydroxy-4,5-methylenedioxypropiophenone, 1,2-Benzenedicarboxylic acid, and butyl 2-methylpropyl ester. Together, they accounted for 75.5, 66.2, 70.2 and 71.2% of the total essential oil obtained from plants grown in 100, 50, 24 and 12% full sunlight, respectively. Main aromatic compounds detected were Benzene,2-methoxy-4-methyl-1-(1-methylethyl)-, 3,5-Dimethoxytoluene, 2-Methoxy-4-vinylphenol, Phenol,2-methyl-5-(1-methylethyl)-, Ethanone and 1-(2-hydroxy-4,6-dimethoxyphenyl). They occupied 14.8,18.4,15.1 and 14.9% of the total essential oil obtained from plants grown in 100, 50, 24 and 12% full sunlight, respectively. Finally, terpenoids compounds detected in the essential oils include.alpha.-Pinene, Camphene,.beta.-Pinene, 3-Carene,.alpha.-Phellandrene, Eucalyptol, (+)-4-Carene, Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-one,1,7,7-trimethyl-,(1S)-, 2,4-Cycloheptadien-1-one,2,6,6-trimethyl-, 3-Cyclohexen-1-ol,4-methyl-1-(1-methylethyl)-, Borneol, 3-Cyclohexene-1-methanol, and.alpha.,.alpha.4-trimethyl- which occupied relatively small percentage in the different essential oils (

Collectively, our data suggest that high light treatments increase essential oil and phenylpropanoid compounds content in
