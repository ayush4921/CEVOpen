0: Nigella sativa L. is a medicinal plant with extensive, nutritional, pharmaceutical, and health applications.
1: Nowadays, reducing the application of chemical fertilizers (synthetic fertilizers) is one of the main goals of sustainable agriculture to allow the production of safe crops.
2: Therefore, the combined effect of urea and biofertilizers was studied on the quantitative and qualitative traits of   N. sativa L. in a randomized complete block design with 10 treatments and three replications.
3: The treatments included control (no fertilization), U (100% chemical fertilizer as urea at 53.3 kg ha  1, Nb (Biofertilizer, Azotobacter vinelandii), Pb (Biofertilizer, Pantoea agglomerans and Pseudomonas putida), Kb (Biofertilizer, Bacillus spp.
4: ), NPKb (NPK, biofertilizer), Nb + 50% U, Pb + 50% U, Kb + 50%U and NPKb + 50% U.
5: The NPK(b) + U50% was related to the highest quantity of plant height, branch diameter, capsule (follicle) number per plant, auxiliary branches, seed yield per plant, thousand-seed weight, essential oil content, total phenolic compounds, flavonoid content, DPPH free radical scavenging, nitric oxide (NO) radical scavenging, superoxide radical scavenging, chain-breaking activity, phosphorus content, and potassium content, along with U for the highest biological yield and (Pb) + U50% for the highest essential oil percentage which is close to (NPKb) + U50%.
6: The lowest value was observed in all traits related to the control treatment except for branch diameter that was related to (NPKb).
7: Hence, the application of (NPKb) + U50% as bio-chemical fertilizers improved   N. sativa L. Traits, so it can be recommended.
