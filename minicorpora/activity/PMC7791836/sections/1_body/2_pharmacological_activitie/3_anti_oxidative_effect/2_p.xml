<p id="Par67">Aging of the skin, induced by both intrinsic and extrinsic factors, is associated with a gradual loss of structural integrity and physiological function [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>]. Skin photoaging is related to the increased activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that were induced in response to the production of ROS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>]. MMP-mediated alterations in the extracellular matrix typically lead to skin wrinkling, which is a prominent feature of premature aging [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>]. The administration of pogostone alleviates both the macroscopic and histopathological lesions observed in UV-damaged skin in mouse model systems; it promoted the activities of the antioxidant enzymes, including CAT, SOD, and GSH-PX, downregulated MDA levels, and inhibited aberrant expression of MMP-1 and MMP-3 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>]. In addition, PO had a substantial therapeutic impact on photoaged rat skin by its capacity to regulate p38MAPK/ERK and the associated apoptotic signaling pathway. Recent studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>] revealed that the administration of PO prevented aberrant increases in MDA, p38MAPK, Ras, Raf, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK), ERK1/2, Bax, Caspase9, c-Fos, and c-Jun, as well as the aberrant decreases in Bcl2, SOD, GSH-PX, and CAT. As such, we conclude that patchouli-mediated anti-photoaging activities may be associated with its anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic properties.
