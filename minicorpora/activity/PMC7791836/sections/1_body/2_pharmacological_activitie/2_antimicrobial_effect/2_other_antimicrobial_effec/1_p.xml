<p id="Par65">Earlier studies identified numerous antimicrobial activities associated with the use of patchouli [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]; among the microorganisms identified in these studies, patchouli promotes resistance against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Vibrio harveyi</italic>, and 
 <italic>Moraxella catarrhalis</italic>. Aqueous extracts of patchouli effectively inhibit biofilm formation associated with multidrug-resistant 
 <italic>V. harveyi</italic> by inducing the upregulation of the biofilm-related bacterial genes luxR and flaB, and by downregulating the expression of luxS, hfq, and ompW with an MIC of 31.25 mg/mL [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. In addition, PO has antimicrobial activities against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms, with an MIC of 25 mg/mL against isolates of 
 <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic>, and 12.5 mg/mL against both 
 <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> in studies carried out in vitro [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. Likewise, the patchouli constituent, pogostone, exhibited significant antibacterial effect on 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> in experiments carried out in vitro with an MIC of 4 µg/mL. Pogostone may exert its antibacterial effect by interacting with 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> cell membrane proteins and its capacity to alter cell membrane permeability [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. Acute otitis media, one of the most common diseases in early infancy and childhood [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>], is a common bacterial complication of viral upper respiratory tract infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. In vitro experiments revealed that PO was active against both 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>M. catarrhalis</italic> with MICs of 0.21 and 0.026 mg/mL, respectively. The administration of PO promotes the resolution of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>M. catarrhalis</italic> infections in the middle ear and reduces the extent of inflammatory cell infiltration at the middle ear mucosa [
