 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">134</xref>]. The results of several studies have suggested that PO and its derivatives, including pogostone, PA, and β-PAE, serve to support the function of the gut epithelial barrier, to facilitate the polarization of M1 to M2 macrophage phenotypes, to increase the diversity of the GM, and to suppress the pro-inflammatory cytokines in mouse model systems. Taken together, these results suggest that the pharmacological activities of PA, pogostone, and β-PAE contribute to the dynamic interactions between the host and the GM [
