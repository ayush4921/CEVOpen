<p id="Par75">The immune system plays a vital role in maintaining the integrity of an organism; the immune system mediates both resistance to pathogens and defense against cancer [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">122</xref>]. Previous research revealed that PA has a positive effect on the immune system, and can promote immunomodulatory actions by activating the mononuclear phagocytic system and by suppressing overactive cellular immune responses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">123</xref>]. There are also recent reports of PO-mediated immunomodulatory activities; these are associated mainly with its capacity to promote the synthesis and release of secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA). SIgA is a first-line immune defense of the surface of the intestinal mucosa; SIgA antibodies promote mucosal immunity, which includes host defense against food antigens, bacteria, viruses, and toxins [

The administration of PO promotes te repair of the intestinal epithelial ultrastructure, reduces intestinal permeability, and protects the intestinal mucosal mechanical barrier in a rat model of post-infectious IBS; the underlying mechanisms include promoting increased levels of SIgA while inhibiting the expression of ICAM-1 [
