<p id="Par56">Some novel ingredients of patchouli have been reported in studies from 2015 to 2020, and their chemical properties and pharmacological activities are included in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. A Study in 2019 have described the identification and isolation of two new glycosidic epimers, cablinosides A and B, which were isolated from the leaves of 
 <italic>P. cablin</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Their structures and associated absolute configurations were elucidated by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and quantum chemical circular dichroism (CD) calculations. Pharmacological research demonstrated that the epimer mixture (including both cablinosides A and B) moderately inhibited the activity of the enzyme α-glucosidase, and was not toxic to human liver HepG2 cells. Similarly, four nor-β-patchoulene sesquiterpenoids were isolated from the essential oil of the leaves and stems of 
 <italic>P. cablin</italic>; these include three new compounds, namely 14-nor-β-patchoul-1(5)-ene-2,4-dione, 2β-Methoxy-14-nor-β-patchoul-1(5)-ene-4-one, 14-nor-β-patchoul-1(5),2-diene-4-one and one new natural product 14-nor-β-Patchoul-1(5)-ene-4-one [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Their structures were elucidated by detailed spectroscopic analyses with one-dimensional (1D)- and two-dimensional (2D)-NMR techniques. Bioactivity testing revealed that 14-nor-β-patchoul-1(5),2-diene-4-one was slightly cytotoxic in assays that included both NCI-H1975 and HepG2 cells. Furthermore, another study have identified two novel hemiketal sesquiterpenoids that were isolated from the essential oil extracts from the aerial parts of patchouli [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The chemical structures of these novel compounds, pocahemiketals A and B, were determined by extensive spectroscopic analyses, electronic CD calculations, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction methods. Both pocahemiketals included a hemiketal α, a β-unsaturated-γ-lactone moiety, and a bicyclo[3.2.1]-carbon core; bioactivity assays revealed that Pocahemiketals B promoted significant vasorelaxant activity when tested against phenylephrine-induced contractions of a rat aorta ring at a half-maximal effective concentration (

 <sub>50</sub>) of 16.32 µM. In addition, seven novel guaiane sesquiterpenoids including Patchouliguaiol A-G and three previously characterized seco-guaianes were isolated from the volatile oil of patchouli; their structures were determined by spectroscopic analyses, a modified Mosher’s method, X-ray diffraction, and electronic CD data. Of these isolates, Patchouliguaiol C exhibited significant vasorelaxant activity (

 <sub>50</sub> = 5.4 µM) when tested in assays of phenylephrine-induced contractions of rat aorta rings. Patchouliguaiol F was also characterized as a vasorelaxant with activity against phenylephrine- and KCl-induced contractions of rat aorta rings (
 <italic>EC</italic>
 <sub>50</sub> of 1.6 and 24.2 µM, respectively). Notably, Patchouliguaiol C and Patchouliguaiol F also exhibited antifungal activity against 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 500 and 300 µM, respectively. In addition, Patchouliguaiol B, Patchouliguaiol G, 7-epi-chabrolidione A, and 1,7-di-epi-chabrolidione A exhibited neuroprotective effect in assays of glutamate-induced injuries targeting rat adrenal PC12 cells [
