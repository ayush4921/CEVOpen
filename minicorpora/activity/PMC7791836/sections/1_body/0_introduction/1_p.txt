0: Pogostemon cablin Benth., also known as patchouli, or Guanghuoxiang in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), is a member of the Lamiaceae family of flowering plants and has been used to treat colds, nausea, fever, headache, and diarrhea [ 1].
1: Guanghuoxiang is among the raw materials used in formulations of numerous famous Chinese patent medicines, including Huoxiang Zhengqi Koufuye (oral liquid) and Baoji Pian (tablets).
2: Huoxiang Zhengqi Koufuye can be used to treat gastrointestinal diseases, while Baoji Pian is mainly used for common cold with summer-heat and dampness syndrome in TCM [ 2 4].
3: Previous research revealed that patchouli was composed of a variety of chemical substances, including monoterpenoids, triterpenoids, sesquiterpenoids, phytosterols, flavonoids, organic acids, lignins, glycosides, alcohols, pyrone, and aldehydes [ 5].
4: Given its multicomponent nature, patchouli has been found to promote numerous pharmacological activities, and has been shown to protect against inflammation [ 6], microorganisms [ 7,  8], tumors [ 9], aging [ 10], and oxidation [ 11].
5: Moreover, patchouli and its extracts exert remarkable beneficial effects that promote the healthy functioning of organs and tissues.
6: Among these findings, patchouli extracts have been shown to protect against gastrointestinal infection with  Helicobacter pylori [ 12] and ulcers [ 13]; they can also suppress adipogenesis and fat accumulation in adipocytes [ 14], alleviate ischemia/reperfusion-induced brain injury [ 15], and prevent atherosclerosis [ 16].
7: Based on previous review, it can be concluded that patchouli alcohol (PA), -patchoulene (-PAE), patchoulene epoxide (PAO), pogostone, and pachypodol are the material basis for patchouli to exert therapeutic effects.
8: As a significant ingredient in patchouli, PA has been most intensively studied in the pharmacological effects including anti-inflammatory effect, anti-apoptotic effect, anti-oxidative effect, anti-tumor effect, and others.
9: Recently, some new pharmacological effects of PA have been explored, a research in 2019 has illustrated that PA could suppress adipogenesis and fat accumulation in adipocytes to prevent obesity [ 17].
10: Another study in the same year demonstrated that PA could exert analgesic effect by regulating opioid receptors [ 18].
11: Furthermore, PA could exert an intensively vasorelaxant effect as a Ca 2+ antagonist [ 19].
12: In addition to PA, pogostone has been reported to possess gastroprotective, anti-photoaging, and antimicrobial properties.
13: Furthermore, a research in 2017 found that pogostone exerted the antitumor activity [ 20], and another study in 2019 revealed that pogostone could protect lung tissue via its role in regulating oxidative stress, which contributes to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [ 21].
14: Moreover, other bioactive ingredients such as -PAE, PAO, and pachypodol have attracted much attention in recent years, and the researches on their pharmacological effects as well as mechanisms has been deepened gradually.
15: The chemical structures of PA, -PAE, PAO, pogostone, and pachypodol are shown in Fig.
16: 1.
17: This review will provide detailed review of the mode of action for the selected chemical on major pharmacological activities.
