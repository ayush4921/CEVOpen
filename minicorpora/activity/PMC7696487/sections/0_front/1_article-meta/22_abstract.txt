0: Piper cubeba L. fruit is an important species used in folk medicine for different types of pains such as rheumatism, chills, flu, colds, muscular aches, and fever.
1: This study examines the chemical constituents, antioxidant activity, and potential inhibitory effect against human peroxiredoxin 5, a key enzyme of   P. cubeba essential oil from fruits.
2: Using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GCMS), the principal components were methyleugenol (41.31%) and eugenol (33.95%), followed by (E)-caryophyllene (5.65%),   p-cymene-8-ol (3.50%), 1,8-cineole (2.94%), and -terpinolene (1.41%).
3: Results showed similar scavenging activity via 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl DPPH radical scavenging activity (IC  50 = 110.00  0.08 g/mL), as well as very potent antioxidant activity against both ferric reducing/antioxidant power (FRAP) (106.00  0.11 g/mL) and -carotene bleaching (IC  50 = 315.00  2.08 g/mL) assays when compared to positive butylated hydroxytoluene and ascorbic acid.
4: The molecular docking approach has also been performed to screen the antioxidant activities of the major and potent compounds against human protein target peroxiredoxin 5.
5: Results showed good binding profiles and attributed the strongest inhibitory activity to -caryophyllene oxide (5.8 kcal/mol), followed respectively by isocembrol and -selinene (5.4 kcal/mol), and viridiflorol (5.1 kcal/mol).
6: Furthermore, ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion)-related physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties have been assessed and support our in vitro findings.
7: This work demonstrates the powerful antioxidant potency of cubeba pepper and paves the way for the discovery and development of antioxidant agent with high potency.
