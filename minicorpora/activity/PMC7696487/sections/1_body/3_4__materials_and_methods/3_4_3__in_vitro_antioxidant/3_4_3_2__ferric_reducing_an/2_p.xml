<p>After centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 min at 25 Â°C, the supernatant was mixed with 2.5 mL of H
 <sub>2</sub>O and 0.5 mL of ferric chloride (0.1% FeCl
 <sub>3</sub>). A blank without a sample was prepared under the same conditions. The optical density was subsequently measured at 700 nm, and BHT (Butylated hydroxytoluene) was used as positive control.
