 <xref rid="B55-plants-09-01534" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The column used is an HP–5MS (5% phenyl) of length 30 m, inside diameter 0.25 mm, and film thickness 0.25 μm. The temperature of the injector and detector was 250 °C. The oven temperature was maintained at 100 °C for 1 min, then increased to 260 °C at a rate of 4 °C/min, and then maintained at 260 °C for 10 min. Helium gas has been used as a carrier gas at a constant rate of 1 mL/min. The injection volume was 1 μL. Ionization conditions by impact electronics (EI) were at an ionic energy of 70 eV and a range of swept mass of 50 to 550
