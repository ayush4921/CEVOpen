<p>On the other hand, the chemical composition of 
 <italic>P. cubeba</italic> fruit’s essential oil has been scarcely explored. Previous reports have shown that its main constituents are β-elemene (9.4%) and sabinene (9.1%) [

 <xref rid="B36-plants-09-01534" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], β-caryophyllene, δ-cadinene, α- and β-cubebene, and minor amounts of monoterpenes were found as the main phytocompounds. Lawrence [
 <xref rid="B37-plants-09-01534" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] reported that the main components were α-copaene, β-cubebene, allo-aromadendrene, γ-muurolene, and germacrene D, followed by δ-cadinene and β-caryophyllene. In the recent study of Andriana et al. [
 <xref rid="B38-plants-09-01534" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], the authors found that terpinen-4-ol (42.41%), α-copaene (20.04%), and γ-elemene (17.68%) were the major components. Based on the above literature descriptions, our chemical composition results are still different, and confirm the originality of our
