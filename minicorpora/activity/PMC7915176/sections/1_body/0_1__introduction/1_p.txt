0: Nanotechnology involves different strategies by using natural and synthetic materials in nanoscale dimensions to fabricate devices widely employed in the electronic and food industries, as well as in the pharmaceutical and biomedical fields [ 1].
1: Polymeric nanocarriers, due to their high surface area and small dimension (1100 nm), are able to increase permeability and solubility of the enclosed molecules, making them available for several health applications, including diagnosis, disease treatments, and imaging [ 2, 3, 4].
2: In addition, effectively modifying the key features of nanocarriers, i.e., size, constituents, shape, and surface properties, it is possible to tune their mechanical, biological, and physicochemical characteristics [ 5].
3: In particular, nanotechnologies have gained outstanding consideration in the development of smart and effective pharmaceutical systems able to transport and deliver bioactive components in a specific site, avoiding, at the same time, deterioration due to enzymatic activity and pH values [ 6].
4: Among bioactive molecules, natural compounds have always represented the most widely employed substances for their unique therapeutic properties against several diseases [ 7].
5: In fact, natural bioactive extracts from plants, herbals, or agro-food by-products represent a rich source of compounds (polyphenols, anthocyanins, flavonoids, and many others) useful in the treatment of various diseases, thus suggesting their addition to pharmaceutical and cosmetic formulations, as well as to nutraceutical supplies [ 8].
6: In particular, many nanodevices (i.e., nanofibers and nanoparticles) have been developed to serve as antimicrobial agents to avoid pathogens proliferation.
7: In literature, a large number of articles can be found, describing the transport of antimicrobial agents, mainly, but not only, to the skin compartment in the wound treatment, in order to prevent infections and/or to accelerate the healing process [ 9, 10, 11].
