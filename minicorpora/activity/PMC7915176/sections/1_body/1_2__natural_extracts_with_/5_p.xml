<p>The phytochemical study of the aerial part of 
 <italic>Pulicaria undulata</italic> L. led to the isolation of nine compounds. The organic extracts (methanol, ethyl acetate, and dichloromethane) of the aerial parts were assayed by in vitro antimicrobial activity against a panel of sensitive microorganisms [

 <italic>Genista saharae</italic> were analyzed. The chloroform extract, containing high amounts of quercetin and naringenin, revealed the antioxidant potential and antibacterial activity against the bacterial strains (MIC 0.02 mg/mL). These results seemed to indicate a high contribution of quercetin and naringenin in the antimicrobial and antioxidant activities recorded [
