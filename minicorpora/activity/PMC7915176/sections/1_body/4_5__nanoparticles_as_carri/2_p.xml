<p>The different methodology can be involved in the fabrication of nanoparticles with suitable properties, including soft lithography, mechanical stretching, microfluidics, or self-assembly, using suitable starting materials, such as small molecules or polymeric structures. When loading bioactive molecules into nanoparticle carriers with the aim to control pathogens growth and/or to prevent infection, different physicochemical and mechanical parameters should be considered, including size, shape, surface, and interior properties (
