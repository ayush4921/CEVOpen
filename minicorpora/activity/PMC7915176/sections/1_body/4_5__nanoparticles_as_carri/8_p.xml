<p>MCM-41 represents a member of SMN with specific morphological and structural properties: uniform hexagonal array and channels with pores ranging from 2–50 nm [
 <xref rid="B190-pharmaceutics-13-00230" ref-type="bibr">190</xref>]. This structure was proposed as a carrier of red propolis [
 <xref rid="B191-pharmaceutics-13-00230" ref-type="bibr">191</xref>], showing remarkable antibacterial, antioxidant, and anticancer properties [
 <xref rid="B192-pharmaceutics-13-00230" ref-type="bibr">192</xref>]. MCM-41 nanocarrier was fabricated by the co-condensation method using n-cetyl-n,n,n-trimethyl ammonium bromide as a template. In this view, different amounts of red propolis were embedded in silica mesoporous nanoparticles and tested against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> at concentrations of 1050, 750, 500, 375, 225, and 150 μg/mL, finding an inhibition zone of approximately 19, 20, 21, 17, 16, and 17 mm in diameter, respectively.
