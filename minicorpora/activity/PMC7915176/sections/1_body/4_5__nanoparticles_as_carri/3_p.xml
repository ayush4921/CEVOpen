<p>Nanoparticles size plays a crucial role in their penetration into biofilm-bacteria, ensuring to overcome the inconvenience usually related to the multidrug-resistant strains. Ideal nanoparticle sizes to fight bacterial infections range between 5 and 500 nm. Generally, to improve the nanocarriersâ€™ efficiency, their size should not exceed the dimensions of water-filled channels into biofilms. In addition, nanoparticles sizes above 500 nm can be easily recognized by the immune system and eliminated from the bloodstream [

Specifically, stealth transport through the bloodstream can be accomplished by decorating nanoparticles with suitable uncharged (polyethylene glycol) or zwitterionic hydrophilic polymers. Contact-killing capacity is strongly influenced by the nanoparticle shape that affects local adhesion forces and subsequently the extent of damage to the bacterial membrane [

In this regard, nano-blades or nano-knives by puncturing bacteria membranes determine the dispersion of intracellular components and cell death. Finally, the hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance into the interior of the nanoparticles should be designed to guarantee high loading capacity towards antimicrobial substances, avoiding the unnoticed loss of the cargo on their way to the infection site.
