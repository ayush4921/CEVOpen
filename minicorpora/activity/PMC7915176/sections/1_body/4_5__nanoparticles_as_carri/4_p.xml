<p>Cinnamon bark extract was embedded in PLGA/PVA nanoparticles synthesized by an emulsion evaporation method using different ratios of lactide/glycolide (65:35 and 50:50); TEM images revealed that nanoparticles were all spherical with a darker perimeter on the edge of the spheres attributed to the PVA. These products were able to gradually release active molecules and effectively inhibit

 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> after 24 and 72 h at concentrations ranging from 224.42–549.23 μg/mL (

 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> Scott A and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 were concentration and time-dependent, with MIC values ranging from 200–1000 μg/mL, higher than the corresponding isolated extracts (from 500–3000 μg/mL) [

Passion fruit by-products (seed and cake) extracts were encapsulated into nanospheres synthesized by emulsion solvent evaporation method, involving different PLGA (lactide to glycolide ratios equal to 50:50 and 65:35) as organic phase and PVA aqueous solution (0.5 % 
 <italic>w/w</italic>). The antimicrobial properties of the systems were evaluated against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>L. innocua</italic>, and PLGA 65:35 particles showed a MIC value of 188 µg/mL against 
 <italic>L. innocua</italic>, while the best PLGA against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> was PLGA 50:50 particle with a MIC of 226 µg/mL. In all the cases, the extracts were derived from cake extracts [
