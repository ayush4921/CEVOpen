<p>Among agro-food wastes, those derived from the olive oil production represent the most representative, especially in the Mediterranean area. Their composition was found to be rich in hydroxytyrosol and secoiridoids derivatives, important for their healthy properties. Inass et al. investigated the in vitro antimicrobial potential of olive mill wastewater and olive cake extracts. Oleuropein and verbascoside, already pointed out in various studies for their important antimicrobial potential, were also detected in these extracts. Furthermore, the elenolic acid, the main fragment of the oleuropein degradation, was mostly found in the olive cake extract. It can be considered as an important antimicrobial and antiviral agent, justifying the reuse of this kind of wastes [
