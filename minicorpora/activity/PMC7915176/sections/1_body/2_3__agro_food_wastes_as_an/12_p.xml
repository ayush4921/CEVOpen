<p>The walnut green husk is an agro-forest waste obtained during walnut (
 <italic>Juglans regia L.</italic>) processing; its aqueous extracts were found to be able to inhibit the growth of Gram-positive bacteria [
 <xref rid="B67-pharmaceutics-13-00230" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Another study reported the antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of extracts of pecan nutshell. The MIC and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values against 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>, 
 <italic>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</italic>, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, and 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> were significantly lower (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) for the extract obtained through infusion, followed by atomization in a spray dryer when compared to the other extracts [

 <italic>v/v</italic>) aqueous solutions of methanol and ethanol extracts of disposed garlic husk displayed antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria when applied at different concentrations (1â€“10 mg/mL). These interesting biological properties could be attributed to specific phenolic compounds, such as caffeic, p-coumaric, ferulic, and di-ferulic acids [
