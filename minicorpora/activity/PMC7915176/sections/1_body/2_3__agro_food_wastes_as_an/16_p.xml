<p>The antimicrobial activity of three abundantly available fruits peel waste (orange, yellow lemon, and banana) was evaluated on a wide range of microorganisms. Methanol, ethyl acetate, ethanol, and distilled water were used for extraction, and the results showed that, among the used solvents, the extracts exhibiting better performances were in decreasing order: Distilled water &gt; Methanol &gt; Ethanol &gt; Ethyl acetate, reflecting the suitability of solvent for fruit peel extraction. Additionally, the effectiveness of fruit peel extracts was evaluated, showing Yellow lemon &gt; Orange &gt; Banana peel. It was observed that Gram-negative bacteria were more sensitive to the extracts, and, among them, 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> showed the highest sensitivity against the extract of yellow lemon peel with the highest zone of inhibition [

 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>. Analyses by GC-MS identified relevant concentrations of compounds exhibiting antimicrobial activity, such as caffeic, gallic, ferulic, and r-coumaric acids, and flavonoids quercetin, myricetin, and epicatechin. This study confirmed that agro-industrial wastes from wine and food industries could be used in the research about new antimicrobial compounds to be used as natural preservatives in the food and beverage industry with promising applications also in the pharmaceutical and biomedical fields [
