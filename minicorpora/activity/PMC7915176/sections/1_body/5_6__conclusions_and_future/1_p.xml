<p>Nanotechnologies have been proposed as a valuable tool to overcome the problems frequently related to the employment of natural products with pharmacological activities. Indeed, most of the clinical trials involving natural products fail due to their poor water solubility, unsuitable molecular weight, and low lipophilicity, which produce unstable structures undergoing high metabolic rate and fast clearance. In addition, if the bioactive molecules are accumulated in non-targeted tissues and organs, significant side effects can be detected.</p>
