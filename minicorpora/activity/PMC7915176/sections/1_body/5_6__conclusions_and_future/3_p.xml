<p>Electrospun nanofibers, usually fabricated by single-fluid electrospinning, represent a valuable approach to produce high performing nanodevices. This goal was reached by employing both natural and synthetic polymers. However, the best results were recorded, fabricating blended macromolecular structures able to conjugate the feature of synthetic constituents (cheapness, mechanical resistance, and electrospinnability) with the highest biocompatibility of the natural polymers, reducing the adverse effects, potentially affecting the different biological compartments. In addition, the loading of several bioactive molecules within nanofibers required the optimization of different key factors, such as burst release reduction and/or low delivery efficiency. Recently, coaxial electrospinning was proposed as an innovative tool to fabricate core-shell nanostructures able to optimize the distribution of bioactive molecules according to the required function. In this way, the burst effect was highly reduced, and the antimicrobial effect against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens was recorded.</p>
