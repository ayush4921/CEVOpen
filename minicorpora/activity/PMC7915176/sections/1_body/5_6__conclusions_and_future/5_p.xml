<p>However, the transfer of these polymeric systems from the laboratory to practical healthcare applications remains a significant obstacle. In general, rigorous protocols of validation of in vitro and in vivo procedures are required to simplify translation from the bench to the clinical trials. Nowadays, some formulations are in clinical or preclinical stages in order to verify long-term toxicity, as well as degradation and metabolism. In the future, the clinical potential of these complex nanostructures should be deeply investigated, employing effective devices in the pharmaceutical and biomedical fields as delivery systems and/or tissue engineering scaffolds, useful to ensure infection control, to speed up skin regeneration, enhancing, in this way, patientâ€™s quality of life.</p>
