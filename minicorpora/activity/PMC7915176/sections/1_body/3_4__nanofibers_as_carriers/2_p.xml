<p>Additionally, electrospun meshes significantly increase adhesion and drug loading due to the structural similarity to the extracellular environment of the living tissues [

Literature data clearly indicate that electrospun nanofibers have the remarkable potential to amplify effectively the biological properties of medicinal plant extracts, essential oils, or pure single components with antimicrobial features. For this reason, they were largely employed as bioactive molecules to fabricate delivery systems, tissue engineering scaffolds, and regenerative medicine devices (
