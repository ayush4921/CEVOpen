<p>Nanofibers have also been proposed as reinforcing agents to improve the mechanical and physical performances of other polymeric devices, such as films, hydrogels, and sponges [

 <italic>Salvadora persica</italic> hydro-alcoholic extract to obtain a device with good antimicrobial properties against both 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. [

 <italic>w/w</italic>) into the CMC matrix caused a significant improvement of the mechanical properties in comparison with CMC. Similarly, composite biosponges of SA reinforced with CNF were prepared [

 <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> and 
 <italic>Tinospora cordifolia</italic> extracts imparted additional antibacterial functionality to the composite against
