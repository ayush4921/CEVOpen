<p>Materials based on cellulose acetate (CA) have been largely employed in the biopharmaceutical processing industry as wound dressings, tissue engineering scaffolds, and drug delivery systems [
 <xref rid="B160-pharmaceutics-13-00230" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>]. Electrospun CA nanofibers encapsulating lemongrass, cinnamon, and peppermint EOs were employed to fabricate scaffold devices able to inhibit bacteria growth. Results demonstrated the complete inhibition of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, while 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> yeast showed a remarkable resistance, mainly due to its diameter more than four times larger than 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> [
 <xref rid="B120-pharmaceutics-13-00230" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. More recently, CA-based nanofibers enclosing rosemary and oregano EOs were evaluated against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli,</italic> and 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> [
 <xref rid="B121-pharmaceutics-13-00230" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. Nanofibers loaded with the oregano oil (containing a high concentration of carvacrol and thymol) displayed the best anti-biofilm and antimicrobial performances. Electrospun nanofibrous mats based on carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and SA were proposed as functional wound dressing materials able to load olive leaf extracts [
 <xref rid="B122-pharmaceutics-13-00230" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. The antibacterial properties of oleuropein and hydroxytyrosol contained in this aqueous extract allowed to fabricate a device able to inhibit pathogens mostly responsible for infections by skin wounds. The analysis of the release profile from the nanofibers depicted a substantial burst effect (50%) and a complete delivery within 24 h.
