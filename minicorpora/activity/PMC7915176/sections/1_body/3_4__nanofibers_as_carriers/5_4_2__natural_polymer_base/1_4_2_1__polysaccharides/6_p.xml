<p>Alternatively, CT-based nanofibers can be fabricated employing PEO, which allows the use of solutions at pH 4, thus not requiring an extremely acid environment. CT/PEO solutions were successfully electrospun, by oil-in-water emulsion technique, into fibrous mats and loaded with cinnamaldehyde (0.5 and 5.0%
