<p>Poly (lactic acid) (PLA) is an outstanding polymeric material largely employed in the pharmaceutical and biomedical sectors due to its excellent biodegradability and biocompatibility [
 <xref rid="B148-pharmaceutics-13-00230" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>]. PLA represents the most extensively used synthetic polymer in the fabrication of nanofibers [
 <xref rid="B149-pharmaceutics-13-00230" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>]. Electrospinning of PLA fibers containing EO derived from 
 <italic>Leptospermum scoparium</italic> and 
 <italic>Melaleuca alternifolia</italic> at different concentrations has been proposed for the treatment of microbial infections induced by 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B95-pharmaceutics-13-00230" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>], a bacterium abundant on human skin and often responsible for infections and formation of biofilms on the medical devices [
 <xref rid="B150-pharmaceutics-13-00230" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>]. The antibacterial activity of 
 <italic>Leptospermum scoparium</italic> EO was mainly ascribed to triketone species, such as flavesone and leptospermone [
 <xref rid="B151-pharmaceutics-13-00230" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>], while terpinen-4-ol and Î±-terpinene determined the antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic>Melaleuca alternifolia</italic> EO. Although 
 <italic>Melaleuca alternifolia</italic> oil showed remarkable activity against 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>, its efficacy was largely limited due to the low amount of active molecules available after the electrospinning process. On the contrary, the antimicrobial activity of the PLA-
 <italic>Leptospermum scoparium</italic> oil system was preserved during the electrospinning process.
