<p>Nanomaterials to be employed as antimicrobial clothing materials or bedding materials for allergic patients often required a lamination process. In this regard, the nanofibers of PU/
 <italic>Juniperus chinensis</italic> extracts were prepared by laminating electrospraying PU adhesive resin on polyethylene terephthalate-based fabric and an electrospun PU nanofiber web [

 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> confirmed that the combination between laminating and electrospinning represents an interesting way to project useful composites to be employed in the biomedical field. Finally, in order to improve the absorption ability of wound exudates, hydrophilic blend materials based on a different weight ratio between PU and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and containing 
 <italic>Malva sylvestris</italic> extract were prepared. The new materials proved to efficiently deliver the bioactive compounds to diabetic wounds [

 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> was recorded.
