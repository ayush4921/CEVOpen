<p>Polyurethane (PU) is a biocompatible hydrophobic polymer, largely used for biomedical and pharmaceutical scopes, owing to its excellent oxygen permeability and good barrier and mechanical properties [
 <xref rid="B155-pharmaceutics-13-00230" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>]. Nanofibers based on PU were successfully prepared to load emu oil, a natural mixture derived from the emu (
 <italic>Dromaius novaehollandiae</italic>), which originated in Australia and positively tested against both Gram-positive (
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic>) and Gram-negative (
 <italic>E. coli</italic>) pathogens [
 <xref rid="B105-pharmaceutics-13-00230" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. Similarly, PU nanofibers were proposed as polymeric carriers of propolis [
 <xref rid="B84-pharmaceutics-13-00230" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>], a resinous substance produced by bees from plant exudates, containing different bioactive compounds [
 <xref rid="B156-pharmaceutics-13-00230" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>]. In addition, the adhesive properties of propolis afford the point-bonding to the PU nanofibers, improving their mechanical issues. The antimicrobial properties of propolis/PU nanofibers were evaluated against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, and the results showed that the bacterial inhibition zone was progressively increased with increasing the propolis amount in the nanocomposite. More recently, herbal extracts of 
 <italic>Agrimonia eupatoria</italic>, 
 <italic>Satureja hortensis</italic>, and 
 <italic>Hypericum perforatum</italic> were loaded on several PU composite nanofibers, and their antimicrobial properties were evaluated against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> [
 <xref rid="B110-pharmaceutics-13-00230" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. Finally, antibacterial and elastic nanofibers from thermoplastic PU were produced by coating process with 
 <italic>Syzgium aromaticum</italic> extract, gained by Soxhlet extraction of clove oil [
 <xref rid="B107-pharmaceutics-13-00230" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. All coated nanofibers (2–10 mg cm
 <sup>−2</sup>) showed antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>.
