<p>In order to improve its water solubility, PLA was successfully modified by hyperbranched polyglycerol, a highly hydrophilic polymer with excellent biocompatibility and water solubility [

Nanofibrous dressing with PLA and the hyperbranched polyglycerol blend was fabricated using electrospinning technique and loaded with curcumin, a polyphenolic biologically active ingredient of turmeric isolated from the dry rhizomes of

Curcumin release profiles, recorded at 37Â°C in PBS and displayed as the increased hydrophilicity of the device, allowed to achieve a complete delivery in 72 h, suggesting its use as potential wound patch dressing for chronic and acute wound diseases.
