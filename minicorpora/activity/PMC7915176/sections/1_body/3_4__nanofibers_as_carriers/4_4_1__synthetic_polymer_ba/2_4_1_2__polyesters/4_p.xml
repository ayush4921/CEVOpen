<p>Polycaprolactone (PCL) represents a biodegradable aliphatic polyester, largely employed to produce nanofibers by electrospinning techniques. The incorporation of suitable natural extracts allowed the fabrication of devices with remarkable antimicrobial properties. Specifically, crude extract of 
 <italic>biophytum sensitivum</italic> was loaded, and experimental release displayed a controlled delivery of the bioactive molecules (59% in 72 h) [

 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (27 mm inhibition) and 
 <italic>E. Coli</italic> (47 mm inhibition). Similarly, electrospun PCL-based nanofiber mats containing natural leaves extracts of 
 <italic>Gymnema sylvestre</italic> [

 <italic>Clerodendrum phlomidis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B100-pharmaceutics-13-00230" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>] were proposed as a wound dressing with remarkable antimicrobial characteristics. The cumulative delivery profiles depicted an intense burst effect, mainly due to bioactive desorption release mechanisms, while a constant delivery of the therapeutic was reached after 24 h.
