<p>In addition, PVA was employed in combination with a natural polymer to achieve bio-nanocomposites fibrous mats. Specifically, a PVA-based device enclosing nanocellulose from pineapple was loaded with 
 <italic>Stryphodedron barbatimao</italic> extract (water-alcohol solution 96:4 
 <italic>v/v</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B115-pharmaceutics-13-00230" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>], a well-known mixture employed in medicine as an antiseptic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-bacterial remedy [
 <xref rid="B158-pharmaceutics-13-00230" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>]. More recently, PVA/guar gum composite nanofibers were proposed as a carrier of alcoholic extract of 
 <italic>Acalypha indica</italic>, a traditionally acclaimed plant for wound healing [
 <xref rid="B116-pharmaceutics-13-00230" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. The release profiles displayed a constant and slow delivery throughout the experimental time, while a complete release was observed after 38 h. The antimicrobial experiments against 
 <italic>E. coli, B. subtilis, S. aureus, P. fluorescens</italic> highlighted bacteriostatic action against all microbial strains. Finally, several EOs (cinnamon, clove, and lavender at a concentration of 0.5, 1, and 1.5% 
 <italic>w/w</italic>) were involved in the synthesis of PVA/sodium alginate (SA) polymeric nanofibers, allowing the preparation of devices able to efficiently inhibit 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B117-pharmaceutics-13-00230" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. Cinnamon oil (1.5% 
 <italic>w/w</italic>)/PVA/SA nanofibers exhibited the best results (inhibition zone of 2.7 cm).
