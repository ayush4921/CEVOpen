<p>During the last years, an increasing interest in the biomedical use of polymeric nanofibers was recorded due to their high porosity, outstanding mechanical strength, and simplicity of fabrication [
 <xref rid="B10-pharmaceutics-13-00230" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In particular, nanofibers have been proposed as systems for the delivery of bioactive molecules [
 <xref rid="B81-pharmaceutics-13-00230" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>] or in regenerative medicine [
 <xref rid="B82-pharmaceutics-13-00230" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>] and also as wound dressings devices [
 <xref rid="B83-pharmaceutics-13-00230" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Usually, polymeric nanofibers can be fabricated by template synthesis [

 <xref rid="B85-pharmaceutics-13-00230" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>], phase separation [
 <xref rid="B86-pharmaceutics-13-00230" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>], and electrospinning [
 <xref rid="B87-pharmaceutics-13-00230" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Among these, the electrospinning technique is the most used strategy for applications in tissue engineering and drug delivery due to its high-throughput, easy handling, and reproducibility (
