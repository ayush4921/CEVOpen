 <p>Site-Specific release of active molecules with antimicrobial activity spurred the interest in the development of innovative polymeric nanocarriers. In the preparation of polymeric devices, nanotechnologies usually overcome the inconvenience frequently related to other synthetic strategies. High performing nanocarriers were synthesized using a wide range of starting polymer structures, with tailored features and great chemical versatility. Over the last decade, many antimicrobial substances originating from plants, herbs, and agro-food waste by-products were deeply investigated, significantly catching the interest of the scientific community. In this review, the most innovative strategies to synthesize nanodevices able to release antimicrobial natural extracts were discussed. In this regard, the properties and structure of the starting polymers, either synthetic or natural, as well as the antimicrobial activity of the biomolecules were deeply investigated, outlining the right combination able to inhibit pathogens in specific biological compartments.</p>
