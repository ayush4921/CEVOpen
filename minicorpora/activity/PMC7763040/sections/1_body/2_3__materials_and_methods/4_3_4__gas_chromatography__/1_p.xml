<p>The chemical composition of 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> EOs was investigated using a Hewlett-Packard gas chromatograph (Agilent, Milan, Italy) equipped with an HP-5 capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm), associated with a Hewlett-Packard mass spectrometer (Agilent, Milan, Italy) (GC-MS) using electron impact ionization (EI) carried out at 70 eV as previously reported [
 <xref rid="B58-molecules-25-05826" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Helium was used as carrier gas. Samples were also analyzed using a Shimadzu GC17A gas chromatograph (GC) (Shimadzu, Milan, Italy) equipped with an ionization flame detector (FID) and an HP-5 capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm). Nitrogen was used as carrier gas. Sage EOs constituents were tentatively identified by comparing their Retention Indices (RI) either with those in the literature or with those of standards [

 <xref rid="B60-molecules-25-05826" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. RI were calculated under the same operating conditions in relation to a homologous series of 
 <italic>n</italic>-alkanes (C
