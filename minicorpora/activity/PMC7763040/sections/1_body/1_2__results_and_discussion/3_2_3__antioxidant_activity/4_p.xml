<p>According to Michelina et al. [
 <xref rid="B52-molecules-25-05826" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], the Italian sage demonstrated a more promising radicals scavenging activity with an ID
 <sub>50</sub> value of 299.1 and 101.5 Î¼g/mL for DPPH and ABTS tests, respectively. For 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> leaves EO from Tunisia, an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 8.31 mg/L was reported against DPPH radicals [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-25-05826" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This result was comparable with another Turkish sage EO previously analyzed by Bouaziz et al. [
 <xref rid="B53-molecules-25-05826" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] that found an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 7.70 mg/L. The capacity to scavenge DPPH radicals was also demonstrated for sage leaves collected in Morocco [
 <xref rid="B54-molecules-25-05826" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 309.42 mg/mL.
