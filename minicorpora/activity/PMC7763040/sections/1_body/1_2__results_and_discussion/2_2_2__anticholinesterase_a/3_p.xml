<p>Other compounds, namely, Î±-phellandrene, linalool, trans-caryophyllene, exhibited a significant positive correlation with AChE inhibition (r = 0.99). It is possible that the activity of the most abundant compounds is modulated by constituents present in the EOs in smaller quantities. This is probably due to the ability of these compounds (i) to penetrate cells, (ii) to make a lipophilic or hydrophilic linkage, and (iii) to fix on cell wall [
