<p>EOs have become of great interest, due to their availability, few side effects and toxicity, as well as their biodegradability [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-25-05826" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Moreover, EOs constituents are able to cross the blood–brain barrier due to their small molecular size and lipophilicity. Sage EOs showed a good AChE and BChE inhibitory activity (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05826-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The highest activity against AChE was exhibited by S1 with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 47.68 μg/mL followed by S2 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 47.68 μg/mL). Comparing the results, several differences were displayed. Indeed, the S1 inhibitory activity was 1.6-times higher in comparison to S3. This action can be justified for highest content in β-pinene and minor constituent borneol. Pearson’s correlation (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-05826">Supplementary Materials, Table S2</xref>) demonstrated that these compounds were positively correlated with AChE (r = 0.99 and 0.96 for β-pinene and borneol, respectively).
