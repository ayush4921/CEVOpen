 <italic>S. fruticosa</italic> essential oil showed lower inhibition against AChE with percentage of 37.0% and 39.2% at a concentration of 1 mg/mL for two Italian samples [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-25-05826" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], 26.04% at concentration of 50 mg/L for a Turkish sample [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-25-05826" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], and 73.52% at 100 μg/mL for another Turkish sample [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-25-05826" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Interesting cholinesterases inhibitory activity was found for 
 <italic>S. leriifolia</italic> EO from in Iran (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.32 and 0.29 μL/mL for AChE and BChE, respectively) [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-25-05826" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> and 
 <italic>S. sclarea</italic> EOs displayed a notable inhibition towards BChE having 66.3% and 76.0% inhibition, respectively [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-25-05826" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. An inhibition percentage of 51.24% and 22.73% at 100 μg/mL was found against BChE for Turkish 
 <italic>S. fruticosa</italic> [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-25-05826" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-25-05826" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], while two Italian EOs were not able to inhibit this enzyme [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-25-05826" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The EOs activity likely results from a complex interaction of its compounds, ultimately producing synergistic or antagonistic responses [

 <xref rid="B46-molecules-25-05826" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Among EOs constituents, α-pinene and 1,8-cineole inhibited AChE with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.63 and 0.67 mM, respectively [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-25-05826" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In other studies, camphor and β-pinene presented an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 21.43 µM and an inhibition percentage of 48.5% (at 1.0 mM), respectively [
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-25-05826" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-25-05826" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Interestingly, selective activity of trans-caryophyllene was observed by Bonesi et al. [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-25-05826" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] against BChE (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 78.6 μM). Some clinical trials suggested that sage EOs can lead to improvements of the mood and cognition [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-25-05826" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Moss et al. [
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-25-05826" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] evaluated the potential of the aromas of 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> and 
 <italic>S. lavandulaefolia</italic> EO to affect cognition and mood in 135 healthy volunteers. Only 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> aroma produced a significant enhancement of memory quality. Kennedy et al. [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-25-05826" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] reported improvement of cognitive performance and mood after 
 <italic>S. lavandulaefolia</italic> EO oral consumption (capsules containing 50 μL of EO) in 36 healthy participants. Substantial improvements in some aspects of mood were also recorded by Tildesley et al. [
 <xref rid="B51-molecules-25-05826" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] after 
 <italic>S. lavandulaefolia</italic> EO treatment (50 μL) in 24 healthy participants. In another study, the administration of 50 μL of 
 <italic>S. lavandulaefolia</italic> EO to patients affected by AD induced a reduction of neuropsychiatric symptoms and an improvement in attention [
