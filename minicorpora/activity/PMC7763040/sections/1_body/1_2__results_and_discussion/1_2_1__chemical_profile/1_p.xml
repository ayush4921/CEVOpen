<p>The fresh aerial parts of 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> harvested in three areas of Calabria (Southern Italy) were subjected to hydrodistillation to obtain essential oils. Two populations (S1 and S3) were on the Tyrrhenian side, whereas the third population was on the Ionia side. All sites are characterized by a Mediterranean climate, but the S2 site results with a subhumid-termo-Mediterranean bioclimate, whereas in the S1 and S3 sites, the bioclimate is humid-meso-Mediterranean. Plants grew in a shrubby habitat with an open canopy structure and some bare ground (garrigue) on a rocky limestone soil.
