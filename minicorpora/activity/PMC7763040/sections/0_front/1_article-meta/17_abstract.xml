  <italic>Salvia officinalis</italic> L. (sage) is one of the most appreciated plants for its plethora of biologically active compounds. The objective of our research was a comparative study, in the Mediterranean context, of chemical composition, anticholinesterases, and antioxidant properties of essential oils (EOs) from sage collected in three areas (S1–S3) of Southern Italy. EOs were extracted by hydrodistillation and analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibitory properties were investigated by employing Ellman’s method. Four in vitro assays, namely, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), ferric-reducing ability power (FRAP), and β-carotene bleaching tests, were used to study the antioxidant effects. Camphor (16.16–18.92%), 1,8-cineole (8.80–9.86%), β-pinene (3.08–9.14%), camphene (6.27–8.08%), and α-thujone (1.17–9.26%) are identified as the most abundant constituents. However, the content of these constituents varied depending on environmental factors and pedoclimatic conditions. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed. Based on Relative Antioxidant Capacity Index (RACI), S2 essential oil exhibited the highest radical potential with an IC
  <sub>50</sub> value of 20.64 μg/mL in ABTS test and presented the highest protection of lipid peroxidation with IC
  <sub>50</sub> values of 38.06 and 46.32 μg/mL after 30 and 60 min of incubation, respectively. The most promising inhibitory activity against BChE was found for S3 sample (IC
  <sub>50</sub> of 33.13 μg/mL).
