0: Salvia officinalis L. (sage) is one of the most appreciated plants for its plethora of biologically active compounds.
1: The objective of our research was a comparative study, in the Mediterranean context, of chemical composition, anticholinesterases, and antioxidant properties of essential oils (EOs) from sage collected in three areas (S1S3) of Southern Italy.
2: EOs were extracted by hydrodistillation and analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).
3: Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibitory properties were investigated by employing Ellmans method.
4: Four in vitro assays, namely, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), ferric-reducing ability power (FRAP), and -carotene bleaching tests, were used to study the antioxidant effects.
5: Camphor (16.1618.92%), 1,8-cineole (8.809.86%), -pinene (3.089.14%), camphene (6.278.08%), and -thujone (1.179.26%) are identified as the most abundant constituents.
6: However, the content of these constituents varied depending on environmental factors and pedoclimatic conditions.
7: Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed.
8: Based on Relative Antioxidant Capacity Index (RACI), S2 essential oil exhibited the highest radical potential with an IC  50 value of 20.64 g/mL in ABTS test and presented the highest protection of lipid peroxidation with IC  50 values of 38.06 and 46.32 g/mL after 30 and 60 min of incubation, respectively.
9: The most promising inhibitory activity against BChE was found for S3 sample (IC  50 of 33.13 g/mL).
