<p id="Par47">In the second part of the study, we induced osteoarthritis by intra-articular injection of MIA to evaluate the nanoemulsionâ€™s analgesic effect. Previous studies showed that MIA injection into the knee joint causes chondrocyte apoptosis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], which results in an imbalance in the extracellular matrix and cartilage damage leading to the OA progression [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The MIA injection to the joint leads to the release of peripheral pro-inflammatory mediators and neuropeptides such as prostaglandins, substance P, and bradykinin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. This inflammatory response can induce sensitization of the nociceptive receptor and hyperactivates the pain pathways [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Our results showed that all the treatments improve the cartilage change induced by MIA injection and reduce the joint pain. Also, the nanoemulsion and diclofenac, an analgesic and anti-inflammatory drug for relieving pain in many inflammatory diseases were more efficient.
