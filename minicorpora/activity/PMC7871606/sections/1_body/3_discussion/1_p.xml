<p id="Par46">The present study aimed to investigate the effect of a nanoemulsion containing peppermint and rosemary essential oils in an animal model of osteoarthritis. Since we used this nanoemulsion as a topical medication to relieve induced joint pain, evaluation of dermal toxicity, and dermal irritation was the first step of this study. Our results showed that the topical application of this nanoemulsion in male and female rats was not toxic. Comparing the lipid profile in the CO and NG groups showed that the nanoemulsion did not alter the lipid profile. Also, serum levels of the NG group’s aminotransferase enzymes, as markers of liver function, did not significantly change compared to the controls. Besides, no change in serum creatinine and urea after receiving the nanoemulsion indicated the animal’s kidney’s normal activity. The examination of hematologic factors showed that the nanoemulsion did not cause blood cell death and did not alter erythrocyte parameters such as hemoglobin and hematocrit. Based on our knowledge, there is no study to evaluate the effect of acute dermal treatment of a nanoemulsion on the hematological and biochemical parameters in an animal model. However, the Ribeiro et al. study has shown that oral administration of nanoemulsion containing

Researchers have shown that nanoemulsion containing natural origin drugs had no dermal toxicity and can lead to better interaction with the skin and enhance skin penetration [
