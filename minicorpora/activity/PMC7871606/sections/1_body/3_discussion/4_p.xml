<p id="Par49">Previous studies have indicated the role of oxidative stress and inflammatory reactions in degenerative processes in OA. Jiang et al. demonstrated that chondrocytes apoptosis is mitochondrial-dependent and related to reactive oxygen species (ROS) elevation [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Our results are inconsistent with previous studies. All applied intervention significantly decreased the MDA level and increased SOD and GPx activity compared to the OA group. Based on our knowledge, although no study evaluates the antioxidant effect of peppermint and rosemary essential oils in osteoarthritis, it has been previously proven in the other disorders. For example, Khalil et al. have shown that peppermint essential oil decreases the MDA and increases the activity of SOD and GSH in the liver exposed to CCL4 [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Furthermore, Hussein and colleagues have demonstrated that nanoencapsulation increased the rosemary essential oilâ€™s stability and antioxidant activity [
