<p id="Par23">Initial test: One patch of the nanoemulsion was placed on the dorsal area of a rabbit’s trunk and removed after 3 min. If no serious skin reaction was observed, the second patch was applied to a different site and removed after 1 h. If the observation at this stage indicated that exposure could humanly be allowed, the third patch was applied and then removed after 4 h. The rabbit was examined for 14 days for any skin changes.</p>
