0: Despite the medicinal properties of essential oils, some factors such as volatility, sensitivity to light and oxygen, and hydrophobicity have restricted the use of essential oils in pharmaceutical formulations [ 16].
1: Nanoemulsion-based delivery systems are favorite methods for improving the stability, decreasing volatility, and enhancing water solubility of the essential oils [ 17].
2: The nanoemulsification of essential oils can increase their stability and improve antimicrobial efficacy [ 17].
3: Nanoemulsions are transparent and thermodynamically stable dispersion of oil and water balanced by an interfacial layer of surfactant and co-surfactant molecules.
4: The droplet size in nanoemulsion is approximately 10200 nm.
5: The tiny size of nanoemulsion droplet provided greater surface area, enhancing skin absorption and making these systems suitable for transdermal delivery.
6: The nanoemulsion improved the bioavailability of the drug and increased the solubility of the lipophilic agent [ 18].
