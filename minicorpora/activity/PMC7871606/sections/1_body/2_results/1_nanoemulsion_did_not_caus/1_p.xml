<p id="Par36">In the initial test, we did not see any serious skin reaction after any of the three sequential (3 min, 1 and 4 h(s)) exposures, and also there were no dermal changes after 14 days. So, the confirmatory test was done using up two additional rabbits. Skin reactions were observed for 1, 24, 48, 72 h(s) and later for 14 days after removing patches, and there was no sign of erythema, edema, and scar.</p>
