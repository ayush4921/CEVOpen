<p id="Par38">MIA injection to the knee joint led to a significant decrease in the withdrawal threshold in comparison with the CO group (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). Paw withdrawal thresholds to von-Frey hairs were significantly decreased from the first day after MIA injection into the left knee joint to the end of the study. Treatment with the gel contained the nanoemulsion (NG), gel contained peppermint and rosemary essential oils (EG), and gel contained 1% diclofenac sodium (DG) increased withdrawal threshold compared to the OA group. The difference between the paw withdrawal thresholds in the OA group and the NG, EG, and DG groups on days 4, 7, and 14 after the injection was significant (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). Data analysis also showed that the difference between the NG group and the DG group was not significant (
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05). At the same time, the antinociceptive effect of the NG was significantly more than the EG group (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) (Fig.
