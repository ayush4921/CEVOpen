<p id="Par39">As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b, the injection of MIA into the rats’ knee joint caused an increase in withdrawal frequency in comparison to the CO group. The difference between the osteoarthritis and CO groups in all days of the test was statistically significant (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). All of the treatments significantly reduced acetone’s sensitivity compared to the OA group (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). The statistical analysis also indicated that the treatment with the gel containing the nanoemulsion was more effective than gel containing essential oil in reducing cold hypersensitivity (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Moreover, no significant difference was observed between the NG and DG groups (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.06).
