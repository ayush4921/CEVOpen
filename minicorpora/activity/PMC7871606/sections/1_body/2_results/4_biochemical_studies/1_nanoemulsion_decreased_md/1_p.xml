<p id="Par42">In order to highlight the impact of MIA injection on lipid peroxidation, the concentration of MDA in synovial tissue was determined (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). The obtained results showed that MDA level of synovial tissue in the OA group significantly elevates in comparison to the CO group. The MDA level of the NG, EG and DG groups was lower than the OA group (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) but the lowest amount of MDA was found in DG group.
