 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c, the intra-articular injection of MIA caused a decrease in GPx activity in the rats’ synovial tissue compared to the CO group (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). Although all treatments significantly increased the GPx activity compared to the OA group (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01), the application of the diclofenac sodium gel led to a prominent enhanced enzyme activity compared to other treatments.
