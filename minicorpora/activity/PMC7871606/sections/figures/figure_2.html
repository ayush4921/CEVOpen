 <caption> Effect of MIA injection and different treatment on MDA amount ( a), SOD activity ( b), and GPx activity ( c) in the joint tissue of the animals ( n = 3 in each group). While intra-articular injection of MIA increased MDA content and decreased SOD and GPx activity in the rats’ synovial tissue, all the treatments, especially diclofenac sodium gel, reversed the effects of MIA injection. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. *** P &lt; 0.001 the CO vs. the OA group, # P &lt; 0.05 all the treatments groups vs. the OA group, ## P &lt; 0.01 all the treatments groups vs. the OA group, ### P &lt; 0.001 all the treatments groups vs. the OA group </caption>
