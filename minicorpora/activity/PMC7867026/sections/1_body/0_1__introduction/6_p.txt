0: Studies evaluating the cytotoxic action of  E. uniflora essential oils on cancer cell lines have shown promising results.
1: Ogunwande (2005) demonstrated that an essential oil presenting the sesquiterpene  1, curzerene, atractylone, and furanodiene has cytotoxic and antiproliferative effects in relation to prostatic carcinoma cells (PC-3), hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2), and breast ductal carcinoma cells (578T) [ 16].
2: Figueiredo (2019) evaluated the cytotoxic effects of  E. uniflora oils and curzerene in relation to human colon (HCT-116), gastric (AGP-01), melanoma (SKMEL-19), and normal human fibroblast (MRC-5) cell lines.
3: Curzerene showed more significant activity against SKMEL-19 cells, with oil samples that contained  1 and  2 in addition to curzerene, germacrene B, caryophyllene oxide, caryophyllene, -elemene, and -elemene as the major compounds showing cytotoxic activity against all cell lines [ 12].
