0: In the first isolation reports of volatile compounds from  E. uniflora leaves, some volatile sesquiterpenes were obtained, such as furanodiene, isofuranoelemene, curzerene, germacrene B, -elemene, selina-4(14),7(11)-diene, -elemene, caryophyllene, germacrene D, bicyclogermacrene, -selinene, atractylone, germacrone, selina-1,3,7(11)-trien-8-one ( 1), and oxidoselina-1,3,7(11)-trien-8-one ( 2) [ 7, 8].
1: Most of these mentioned sesquiterpenes are also known as volatile components of various plant species from other botanical families, especially from the Zingiberaceae ( Curcuma), Burseraceae ( Commiphora), and Apiaceae ( Smyrnium) [ 9, 10, 11, 12, 13].
2: To date, the sesquiterpenes selina-1,3,7(11)-trien-8-one ( 1) and oxidoselina-1,3,7(11)-trien-8-one ( 2) ( Figure 1) have been found solely in  E. uniflora.
