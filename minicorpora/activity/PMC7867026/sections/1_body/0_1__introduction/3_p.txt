0: Studies on the chemical composition of essential oils from  E. uniflora leaves show that compounds  1 and  2 are not thermosensitive, but some other components can undergo Cope rearrangement transformations during gas chromatography analysis, a method that is proven to be especially inadequate for the analysis of sesquiterpenes such as furanodiene, curzerene, germacrene B, -elemene, germacrone, and -elemenone [ 7, 8].
1: This analytical aspect requires attention when interpreting the results of numerous publications on the chemical composition and biological activities of essential oils.
