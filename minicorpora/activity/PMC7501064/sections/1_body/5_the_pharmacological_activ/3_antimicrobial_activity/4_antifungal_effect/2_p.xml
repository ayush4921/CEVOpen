<p id="par0070">Due to the excessive use of antifungal drugs, resistance is a widespread problem. Plant based medicines have attracted researchers as potential alternative treatments for fungal infections (

 <xref rid="bib0230" ref-type="bibr">Doudi et al., 2014</xref>). Antifungal activity is chiefly due to TQ of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic>. TQ, thymohydroquinone and thymol confirmed antifungal activity against dermatophytes, moulds and yeasts (

 <italic>N. sativa</italic> inhibits the growth of 
 <italic>Candida yeast</italic> (

 <italic>N. sativa</italic> extracts were also seen against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> (

 <italic>in vitro Aspergillus niger</italic> and 
 <italic>Fusarium solani</italic> activity similar to the antifungal drug amphotericin-B (

 <xref rid="bib0620" ref-type="bibr">Randhawa et al., 2005</xref>). Moderate antifungal effects were found by TQ in three main groups of dermatophytes Trichophyton, Epidermophyton and Microsporum (
 <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">Abd-El-Kader et al., 1995</xref>). 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> ether extracts also exhibit antifungal results but produce a more favorable action in higher concentrations. Extracts inhibit 80â€“100% growth of the most dermatophytes in range of 40 mg/ml, while the minimum inhibitory concentration of TQ against different dermatophytes ranged from 0.125 to 0.25 mg/ml (
