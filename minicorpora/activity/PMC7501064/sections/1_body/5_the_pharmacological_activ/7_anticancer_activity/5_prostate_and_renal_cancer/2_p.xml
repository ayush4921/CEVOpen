<p id="par0130">TQ has been shown to be useful for the management of hormone refractory and hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (
 <xref rid="bib0760" ref-type="bibr">Yi et al., 2008</xref>). TQ prevents prostate tumour growth with almost no chemotoxic side effects. It has also been reported that endothelial cells were more susceptible to thymoquinone-induced cell proliferation, cell apoptosis and cell migration inhibition in contrast to PC3 cancer cells. TQ inhibited growth of vascular endothelial factor-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation.
