 <italic>N. sativa</italic> oil extract that induces apoptosis and inhibits proliferation in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) cells (
 <xref rid="bib0205" ref-type="bibr">Chehl et al., 2009</xref>). TQ induces proapoptotic modes and anti-inflammatory actions and acts as a novel inhibitor of pro-inflammatory pathways. The high molecular weight glycoprotein mucin 4 is abnormally expressed in cancer of the pancreas and contributes to the regulation of proliferation, differentiation and metastasis of pancreatic cancer cells. TQ exhibits a down-regulatory effect on mucin 4 in pancreatic cancer cells (
