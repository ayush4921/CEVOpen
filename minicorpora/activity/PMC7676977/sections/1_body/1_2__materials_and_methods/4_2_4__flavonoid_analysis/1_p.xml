<p>Determination of flavonoid content in the tested herbal brews was performed by means of spectrophotometry (
 <italic>λ</italic> = 425 nm) according to a modified Polish Pharmacopoeia VIII [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] procedure. The results of the flavonoid content were expressed in quercetin equivalents (Sigma-Aldrich, ACS reagent ≥ 98.00%). The results were calculated from the equation of the calibration curve prepared for quercetin standards in the concentration range 1.2–12 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup> (1.2, 1.8, 3, 9, and 12 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup>). Each sample, depending on the material of herbal, was diluted appropriately to the range of the standard curve. All analyses were performed in triplicate.
