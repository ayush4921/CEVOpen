 <italic>GC/MS</italic>. ITMS Varian 4000 GC-MS/MS (Varian, USA) equipped with a CP-8410 autoinjector and a 30 m × 0.25 mmi·d. VF-5 ms column (Varian, USA), film thickness 0.25 
 <italic>μ</italic>m, was used; carrier gas He at a rate of 0.5 ml·min
 <sup>−1</sup>; injector and detector temperature 250°C and 200°C, respectively; split ratio 1:50; and injection volume 0.50 
 <italic>μ</italic>l. A temperature gradient was applied (50°C for 1 min, then incremented by 4°C min
 <sup>−1</sup> to 250°C, and then held at 250°C for 10 min); ionization energy 70 eV; mass range 40–870 Da; and scan time 0.80 s.
