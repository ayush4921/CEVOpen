<p>In the presented study, the dominant components in the composition of sage oil were camphor (16.57%), 
 <italic>cis</italic>-thujone (16.31%-control), viridiflorol (15.44%), and 
 <italic>trans</italic>-thujone (8.37%). Zawiślak [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] reports that the main components of sage oil were 
 <italic>α</italic>-thujone (up to 21.51%), camphor (up to 18.08%), and 1,8-cineole (up to 18.04%). In the case of sage oil, also a trend was observed, where the contents of 
 <italic>cis</italic>-thujone and camphor decreased, respectively, from 16.31% (primary material) to 13.92% (secondary material after brewing conducted for 30 min) and from 16.57% (primary material) to 11.53% (secondary material after brewing conducted for 30 min). This may indicate a better water solubility of these two main components of the essential oil compared to the others, resulting in a lower content in the waste material. In the case of viridiflorol in sage oil, an opposite trend was observed, i.e., in oil acquired from the primary, unprocessed material, a content of 10.10% of that component was noted, while for the secondary, postbrewing plant materials, sage oils had a higher levels of viridiflorol: from 12.02% (secondary sample after 5 min brewing) to 15.44% (secondary sample after 30 min brewing). Sage oil and its preparations have antiperspirant properties, display anti-inflammatory effects, and inhibit microbial growth; they are used in cases of infections of mucous membranes of the throat and mouth (inflammation of the mouth, gums, and throat) [
