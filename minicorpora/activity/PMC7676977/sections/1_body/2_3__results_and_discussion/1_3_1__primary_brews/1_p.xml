<p>The concentration of polyphenols in the primary brews is illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(a)</xref>. With an extension of the time of brewing conducted for the first time from the initial herbal material (95°C, primary brewing), the content of biologically active compounds from the group of polyphenols generally increased for the brews of sage, lavender, fennel, and caraway, attaining the highest concentrations after 15 min (from 141 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup> for fennel to 1006 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup> for sage) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(a)</xref>). In the case of the mint brews, the highest concentration of polyphenols was found for the brews prepared during 15 and 30 min (3966 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup> and 4018 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup>). The chamomile brews did not differ statistically significantly in terms of their polyphenol contents among the particular brews from the plant material prepared in the various time variants (average of 439 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup>). The variation of the concentration of polyphenol content in the analysed brews from the particular herbal species results from the content of those substances in the plants, determined by their botanical features. The relation of the maximum concentration of polyphenols in the analysed brews to the kind of the analysed herbs is proportional to their total content converted to gallic acid in the dry matter of the plants as reported in the literature: mint—63 mg·g
 <sup>−1</sup> dry matter (DM), sage—24.30 mg·g
 <sup>−1</sup> DM [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], chamomile—17.70 mg·g
 <sup>−1</sup> DM [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], lavender—16.92 mg·g
 <sup>−1</sup> DM [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], fennel—10.17 mg·g
 <sup>−1</sup> DM [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and caraway—3.99 mg·g
 <sup>−1</sup> DM [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A correlation of the concentration of polyphenols in brews from plants and the duration of the process of brewing was observed also by Dmowski et al. [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] who, as a result of brewing of China black tea conducted for 15 min, obtained higher concentrations of polyphenols in the brew (average of 239.57 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup>) compared to shorter brewing times (average of 67.70 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup>), which has an impact on the characteristics of the brew in terms of health-promoting properties. A study by Shannon et al. [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] indicates that brewing time of 5 min was optimal for the acquisition of the highest concentrations of polyphenolic compounds in brews from green (557.58 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup>) and black (499.19 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup>) tea. In a study conducted by Rusinek-Prystupa [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] on the content of active compounds in brews from various species of China tea (black, green, and red), it was found that the content of phenolic acids increased with extension of brewing time (from 1 to 6 min). A similar relationship was observed by McAlpine and Ward [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] who studied the effect of brewing time (1–10 min) of black, green, and herbal teas on the concentration of polyphenols and on the antioxidant activity.
