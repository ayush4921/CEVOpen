 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> illustrates the efficiency of the process of primary brewing for the isolated essential oil. The data indicate that the highest level of extraction efficiency was a characteristic of chamomile (86.96%) and then of peppermint (65.15%), sage (53.06%), caraway (48.42%), and lavender (34.45%), and the lower efficiency was noted in the case of fennel (14.08%). As water extraction liberates essential oil only to a small extent, in the case of repeat use of postbrewing material, one should consider the application of a lipophilic solvent, for example, a vegetable oil, that would be medium allowing to conduct a process of extraction with a high degree of efficiency. Such oil extracts could be used for the production of diet supplements.
