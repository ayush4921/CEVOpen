<p>Due to the low solubility of essential oils in water, the efficiency of water extraction and their concentration is relatively low, but the high biological activity of those components allows their health-promoting effects already at low concentrations. As in the case of polyphenolic compounds, the concentration of essential oils in the primary herbal brews was directly proportional to the duration of the brewing process (5–30 min) as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. In the case of brew from narrow-leaved lavender, the concentration of essential oil varied in the range from 206 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup> to 308 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup>, in the brew from leaves of sage—from 30 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup> to 195 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup>, from caraway—from 615 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup> to 803 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup>, from fennel fruits—from 83 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup> to 225 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup>, chamomile—from 4 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup> to 75 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup>, and peppermint—from 225 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup> to 255 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup>. Tschiggerl and Bucar [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] demonstrated in their study that the concentration of essential oil for fennel brews (15 min) and lavender brews (10 min), as converted to analogous brews, was at the level of 810 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup> and 315 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively.
