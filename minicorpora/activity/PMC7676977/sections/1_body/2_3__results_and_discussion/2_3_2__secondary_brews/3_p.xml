<p>Analysis of the content of essential oil in the postbrewing plant material indicates that it can be a valuable raw material for the acquisition of volatile components (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The brewing process caused the liberation of essential oil from the secretory structure only to a small extent because essential oils have poor solubility in water. The highest content of essential oil was noted for fennel fruits and caraway, at 3.20% 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic> and 3.32% 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic>, respectively, whereas in the postbrewing material from fennel and caraway, the following levels of essential oil content were obtained: for fennel from 2.75% 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic> (30 min) to 3.03% 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic> (5 min) and for caraway from 1.71% 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic> (30 min) to 2.09% 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic> (5 min.). The content of essential oil in flowers of narrow-leaved lavender was 1.79% 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic>, while after the process of brewing, the postbrewing (waste) plant material contained from 1.17% 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic> (30 min) to 1.52% 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic> (5 min) of essential oil. In the case of leaves of sage, the levels of essential oil were as follows: in the initial raw material—0.74% 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic> and in the postbrewing material—from 0.35% 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic> (30 min) to 0.68% 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic> (5 min). The content of essential oil in peppermint was 0.99%, while after the process of brewing the plant material contained from 0.35% 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic> (15 min) to 0.66% 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic> (5 min) of essential oil. The lowest content of essential oil was noted in the case of chamomile—0.17% 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic>, while in the postbrewing chamomile material, the content assayed was from 0.02% 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic> (30 min) to 0.17% 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic> (5 min). Analysis of the content of the essential oil in the postbrewing material showed significant percentage residue of these biologically active substances calculated from the difference in extraction efficiency and content in the primary material in the range of 46.94%–91.84% (salvia), 65.55%–84.87% (lavender), 51.58%–62.90% (caraway), 13.04%–95.65% (chamomile), 34.85%–66.67% (peppermint), and 85.92%–94.84% (fennel) compared to the primary material, depending on the brewing time (Figures
