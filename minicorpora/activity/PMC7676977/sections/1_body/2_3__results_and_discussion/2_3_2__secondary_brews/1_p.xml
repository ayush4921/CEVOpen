<p>Wang et al. [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] found that each successive brewing (secondary brewing) significantly reduced the content of catechins and phenolic compounds in the brews obtained. Secondary brewing leads to an effective isolation of biologically active substances, which allows repeated use of herbal residues from the process of preparation of, for example, brews.
