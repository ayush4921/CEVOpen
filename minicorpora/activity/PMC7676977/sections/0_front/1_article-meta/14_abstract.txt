0: Primary and secondary herbal brews were tested for the content of polyphenolic compounds, flavonoids, and essential oil.
1: The brewing process was carried out at an initial temperature of 95C and different time parameters (5, 10, 15, and 30 min).
2: A secondary brewing was also carried out to estimate the reuse of the herbal material.
3: The highest content of polyphenol compounds and flavonoids was determined in the primary peppermint brews (4017 mg L  1 and 360 mg L  1, respectively).
4: The secondary brews were characterised by a lower content of active substances than the primary brews.
5: The study showed that the herbal postbrewing material contained significant levels of essential oil (from 13.04% to 95.65%) and may be an alternative source of volatile bioactive compounds.
