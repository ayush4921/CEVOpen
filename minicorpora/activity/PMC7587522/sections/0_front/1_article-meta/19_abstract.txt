0: The nanoencapsulation of essential oils enhances their applicability in several areas, such as pharmaceuticals and food biopreservation.
1: This study focuses on the encapsulation of   Saccocalyx satureioides Coss.
2: et Durieu essential oil into nanoemulsions by high-pressure homogenization (HPH) and its effect on the volatile constituents and the antioxidant and anticancer activities of the essential oil.
3: The analysis of hydrodistilled (HD)   S. satureioides essential oil using gas chromatographymass spectrometry revealed a total of 28 constituents, representing 99.80%, while only 13 constituents were identified in nanoemulsions, representing 98.65% of the total volatile material.
4: The use of HPH led to qualitative and quantitative differences between the volatile profiles of the HD and the nanoemulsion of   S. satureioides essential oil.
5: Whereas borneol, -terpineol, and thymol were the predominant constituents in the HD oil, carvacrol, thymol, and -terpinene were the major constituents in the nanoemulsion.
6: The antioxidant activity of the   S. satureioides essential oil nanoemulsion displayed was lower as compared to that of HD oil using DPPH free radicalscavenging, CUPRAC, and ABTS assays.
7: This is consistent with the differences in total flavonoid, total phenolic, and volatiles detected in both HD oil and its nanoemulsion.
8: Meanwhile, the cytotoxicity on liver cancer cells (Hep-G2) was stronger using nanoemulsions (106 g/mL) than using HD oil (274.8 g/mL).
