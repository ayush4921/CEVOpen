<p>Estimation of flavonoids content: The flavonoid content in essential oils and nanoemulsions was determined by the measurement of absorbance at 430 nm. Absorbance values depend on complex flavonoidâ€“aluminum formation. Rutin was used to make the calibration curve, and then 1 mL of diluted samples was separately mixed with 1 mL of a 2% aluminum chloride methanolic solution. After incubation at room temperature for 15 min, the absorbance of the reaction mixture was measured at 430 nm, and the flavonoid content was expressed in mg per g of rutin equivalent (RE) [
