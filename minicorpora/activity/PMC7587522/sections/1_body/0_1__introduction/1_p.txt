0: Knowledge in medicinal plants is growing exponentially through the determination of the chemical compositions and biological activities of thousands of species.
1: This knowledge is now exploited in thousands of applications ranging from human and veterinary medicines, agriculture, food biopreservation, ingredients of fragrances, flavoring, and decorative cosmetics [ 1, 2].
2: The Lamiaceae family, with 236 genera and more than 7000 species, is known for its aromatic members.

5: It was reported only in northeastern Algeria, and it is endemic, particularly in a pre-desert area [ 3].
6: It was first described in 1835 [ 4].
7: The impressive results obtained from studies on the chemical composition of its essential oils and their biological activities revealed that this plant has earned an important place among medicinal plants [ 3, 5].
8: A review of the literature showed that the complex mixture of the bioactive compounds of its essential oil includes the following components: borneol, thymol, -terpineol, and p-cymene [ 5].
9: In addition to its uses in folk medicine to treat spasms and gastric disorders, this wealth of active compounds encourages researchers to apply it in various fields as antimicrobial, antifungal, and an antioxidant for the oil extracted from the plant cultivated in Djelfa, Algeria [ 3].
