<p>Applications of essential oils including 
 <italic>Saccocalyx satureioides</italic> Coss. et Durieu oil is currently limited in the pharmaceutical and food industries owing to their sensitivity to and instability under environmental stress, as well as their volatility, aroma, and flavor. The former drawbacks make encapsulation into nanoemulsion an attractive technique that may facilitate the use of different essential oils in more fields [

The reduction of a droplet size is a comminuting process based on energy-intensive techniques, e.g., high-pressure homogenization (HPH), which enables the breakup of the bulk oil phase with the formation of nano-oil droplets dispersed in the water phase [
