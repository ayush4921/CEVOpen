0: Applications of essential oils including  Saccocalyx satureioides Coss.
1: et Durieu oil is currently limited in the pharmaceutical and food industries owing to their sensitivity to and instability under environmental stress, as well as their volatility, aroma, and flavor.
2: The former drawbacks make encapsulation into nanoemulsion an attractive technique that may facilitate the use of different essential oils in more fields [ 2, 6].
3: The essential oil is more stable when stored as nanoemulsion vesicles with a droplet size range of 20 to 200 nm.
4: The reduction of a droplet size is a comminuting process based on energy-intensive techniques, e.g., high-pressure homogenization (HPH), which enables the breakup of the bulk oil phase with the formation of nano-oil droplets dispersed in the water phase [ 7].
