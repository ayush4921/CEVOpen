<p>Knowledge in medicinal plants is growing exponentially through the determination of the chemical compositions and biological activities of thousands of species. This knowledge is now exploited in thousands of applications ranging from human and veterinary medicines, agriculture, food biopreservation, ingredients of fragrances, flavoring, and decorative cosmetics [
