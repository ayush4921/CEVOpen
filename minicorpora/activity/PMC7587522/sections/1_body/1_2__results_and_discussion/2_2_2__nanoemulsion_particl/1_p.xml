<p>The transmission electron microscope (TEM) characterization of oil nanoemulsions gives the actual size and shape, and droplets in nanoemulsions appear dark. The TEM micrograph showed that the nanoparticles were spherical in shape and had an average diameter of 68.4 Â± 0.13 nm based on ImageJ software that adjusted the contrast between background and particles and calculated the diameter of rounded nanoparticles automatically (
