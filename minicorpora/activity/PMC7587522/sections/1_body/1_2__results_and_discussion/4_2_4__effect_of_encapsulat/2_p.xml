 <xref rid="molecules-25-04756-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows that the antiproliferative effect is mainly due to bioactive mono- and sesquiterpenes, especially the oxygenated ones that represent the major components identified in the 
 <italic>S. satureioides</italic> HD oil and its nanoemulsions, such as p-cymene, γ-terpinene, borneol, α-terpineol, thymol, and carvacrol [

 <xref rid="B25-molecules-25-04756" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The potential efficacy of the examined 
 <italic>S. satureioides</italic> HD oil and its nanoemulsions is believed to be based on the cytotoxicity of their main active components and/or their synergic effect. However, the quantitative differences recorded among these components could be responsible for the variation in the cytotoxic activity between the HD oil and its nanoemulsions. According to Elshafie et al. [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-25-04756" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], the cytotoxic activity of the predominate components in 
 <italic>Origanum Vulgare</italic> L. (carvacrol, citral, and thymol) was higher than that of the crude oil itself, which was also reported by Ozkan and Erdogan [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-25-04756" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Moreover, p-cymene and its metal complexes were reported as antitumor agents with inhibiting tumor proliferation through an antiangiogenic mechanism, cancer cell cytotoxicity, and anti-adhesion [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-25-04756" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], while γ-terpinene recorded a mild cytotoxic activity in divergent tested cell lines [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-25-04756" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Hence, the higher cytotoxicity of the 
 <italic>S. satureioides</italic> oil nanoemulsions could be due to the higher content of carvacrol, thymol, and p-cymene in comparison with the HD oil regardless of the total phenolic and flavonoid contents (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04756-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Several mechanisms were reported to reveal the cytotoxicity effect of active constituents, such as thymol and carvacrol [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-25-04756" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The induction of glutathione S-transferase activity in various tissues to eliminate chemical carcinogens is one of those mechanisms [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-25-04756" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Another possible mechanism is based on the induction of cell death by apoptosis and/or necrosis, which leads to increasing the cell permeability and hence losing several cytoplasmic organelles [

 <xref rid="B31-molecules-25-04756" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The findings of the study revealed that the synergetic and/or antagonistic effect of the main constituents of the HD oil and its nanoemulsions constitute the main factor in assessing their cytotoxic activity and that the engagement between anticancer and antioxidant activities needs further investigation.
