<p>Furthermore, the admetSAR online tool was used to predict the toxicological properties of the 13 selected compounds. Results of the present study showed that except for Î±-cadinene and linalyl acetate none of the substances posed a risk of Ames toxicity, carcinogenicity, acute oral toxicity, and weak rat acute toxicity (
