<p>Amongst many significant animal experiments, elevated plus maze (EPM) is one of the most important behavioral assays for the assessment of anxiolytic-like effects. The sensitivity of this test to the effect of anti-anxiety and anxiogenic drugs acting to the GABA benzodiazepine complex is very high [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-26-00975" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The EPM apparatus has two opposite open and two closed arms, where regular mice normally spend much of their allowed time in the closed arms. This type of behavior reflects a distaste for open arms created by the anxiety caused by open spaces. Drug-like anxiolytics that enhance the exploration of open arms are believed to have anxiolytic activity. Administration of extract significantly increased the time spent in open arms compared to the control (
