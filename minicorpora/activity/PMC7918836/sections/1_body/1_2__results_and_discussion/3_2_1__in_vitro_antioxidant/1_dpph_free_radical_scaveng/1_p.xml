<p>Imbalances between the production of ROS and intracellular antioxidants provoke the formation of excessive reactive species leading to the process of atherothrombosis via release of pro-thrombotic and inflammatory molecules [

Similarly, excessive production of ROS and meager antioxidant defenses in the brain make it highly vulnerable to the pathophysiology of different diseases. Evidence suggests that oxidative stress is connected to anxiety-related behavior by destabilizing neurotransmission and brain activities [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00975-f001">Figure 1</xref>. The extract showed an efficient scavenging effect in the DPPH assay. The half inhibition concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) for free radicals achieved by MEHA is 199.51 μg/mL which is statistically significant compared to that (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 42.70 μg/mL) of ascorbic acid (reference compound).
