<p>Polyphenols are plant secondary metabolites that provide potential health benefits by dietary intake acting as potential antioxidants [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-26-00975" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], which may boost the brain energy by scavenging ROS and inhibit the inflammation signaling system ameliorating depression and anxiety [

 <sup>−</sup> channel complex, modulate the monoaminergic neurotransmitter and increase dopamine, serotonin, and monoamines levels in the central nervous system [

 <xref rid="B31-molecules-26-00975" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. We have analyzed and measured the amount of polyphenols (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00975-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) measured as total phenolics content (147.716 ± 5.07 mg GAE/g) and total flavonoids content (66.65 ± 6.208 mg QE/g dried extract). These results provide the information that MEHA could be the potential therapeutic target for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders and thrombosis.
