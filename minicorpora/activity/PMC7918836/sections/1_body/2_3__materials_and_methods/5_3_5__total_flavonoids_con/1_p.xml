<p>Total flavonoids content was measured following a method described by Kumaran et al. [
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-26-00975" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] using quercetin as a reference standard. Briefly, 1 mL of MEHA in methanol (10 mg/mL) was mixed with 1 mL aluminum trichloride in methanol (20 mg/mL) and a drop of acetic acid, and then diluted with methanol to 25 mL. The mixture was allowed to stand for 40 min followed by measuring the absorbance at 415 nm. Finally, total flavonoid content was determined using quercetin (12.5–100 μg/mL) standard calibration curve. The values were expressed as mg of quercetin equivalent (QE) per g of extract (mg QE/g). The test was performed for three times and results were expressed as mean ± SEM.
