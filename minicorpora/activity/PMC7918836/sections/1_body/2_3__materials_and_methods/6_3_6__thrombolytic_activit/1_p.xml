<p>This experiment was done according to the method delineated by Prasad et al. [
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-26-00975" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Briefly, 5 mL sterile distilled water was added in the commercially available lyophilized streptokinase vial (1,500,000 IU) and mixed uniformly for using it as a stock solution. Appropriate dilution was prepared from the stock solution. Next, 5 mL of venous blood was drawn from the healthy volunteers (
 <italic>n</italic> = 10) without having the history of oral contraceptive or oral anticoagulant therapy as well as having normal physiological parameters (blood pressure, heart rate, BMI and body temperature). The collected blood was distributed (0.5 mL/tube) to each ten previously weighed sterile micro centrifuge tube and incubated at 37 °C for 45 min to form the clot. After clot formation serum was completely removed without dislodged the clot and clot weight was determined from each tube by again measuring the tube weight. Then, 100 μL of MEHA (10 mg/mL) was added to each micro-centrifuge tube containing pre weighed clot. A volume of 100 μL streptokinase as a positive control and 100 μL distilled water as a negative control were separately added to the marked control tubes. For clot lysis observation, all the tubes were then incubated for 90 min at 37 °C. After incubation, released fluid was removed and the tubes were weighed again to observe the difference in weight after clot disruption. The percentage of clot lysis was determined by taking the difference in weight before and after clot lysis.
