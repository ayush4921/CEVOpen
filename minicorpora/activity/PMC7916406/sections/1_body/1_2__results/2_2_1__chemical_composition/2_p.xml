<p>Thirty-four individual compounds were detected in the EO of 
 <italic>P. carpunya</italic> collected in winter (PCW) and thirty compounds in the EO of the species collected in summer (PCS), which represent 98.86% and 98.26% of the total essential oil, respectively. Monoterpenes (hydrocarbons and oxygenates) were the most representative group with 83.38% in the PCW and 95.76% in PCS essential oil. In the PCW EO, eleven out of thirty-four compounds were oxygenated monoterpenes (OXM), with a contribution of 59.94%, nine were aliphatic monoterpene hydrocarbons (ALM), which represent 23,45% of the total, sesquiterpenes (hydrocarbons and oxygenates) represent about 14%, and it was not possible to determine the presence of aromatic monoterpene hydrocarbons (ARM). In the PCS EO, ALM compounds represent 55.58% and the OXM compounds 35.45%. Furthermore, a low amount of aliphatic sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (ALS) (1.93%) and traces of oxygenated sesquiterpene (OXS) were identified.
