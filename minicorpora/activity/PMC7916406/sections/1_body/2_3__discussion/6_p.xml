<p>The absence of antioxidant activity in the DPPH assay, for the essential oil in this study, may be explained by the fact that terpene compounds are not capable of donating a hydrogen atom [

 <xref rid="B48-plants-10-00338" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], are being antagonized by other compounds present in the essential oil, since the EO did not present antioxidant activity in the in vitro test, which is an assay directly related to the nature of the compound (the compound must not be metabolized) [

 <xref rid="B50-plants-10-00338" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. We suggest that the absence of in vitro antioxidant activity in 
 <italic>P. carpunya</italic> essential oils mainly consisting of monoterpene and sesquiterpene, which have antioxidant activity, may be due to antagonism with other compounds.
