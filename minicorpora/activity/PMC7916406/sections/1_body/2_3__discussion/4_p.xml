<p>Regarding the in vitro antimicrobial activity of natural products, in 2017, Van Vuuren and Holl suggested a classification scale for extracts and essential oil [
 <xref rid="B35-plants-10-00338" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In summary, for essential oils, the activity is classified as very strong when MIC is ≤100 μg/mL, strong when MIC is between 101 and 500 μg/mL, and moderate for values of MIC between 500 to 1000 μg/mL. On the basis of these criteria, the essential oil from 
 <italic>P. carpunya</italic> presented a strong activity against Gram-negative bacterium 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> (ATCC 9997) with a MIC of 500 μg/mL. However, according to Cos et al., to correct for the many false positives, for all anti-infective bioassays, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> valid values should be lower than 100 μg/mL for mixtures of compounds and lower than 25 μM in the case of pure compounds [

Additionally, the essential oil was tested against two Gram-positive bacteria, but the EO did not show activity at the maximum concentration tested (1000 μg/mL). The loss of activity is frequently caused for the phenomenon of additive or synergistic effects in mixtures or extracts [
