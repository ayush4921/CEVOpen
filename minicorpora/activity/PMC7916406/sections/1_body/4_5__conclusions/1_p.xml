<p>A complete characterization of the chemical composition, enantioselective analysis, physical properties, and antimicrobial, antioxidant, and AChE inhibitor activities was conducted for 
 <italic>Piper</italic>
 <italic>carpunya</italic> essential oil. The results show that the main compounds are present in the essential oil whether it is made from leaves collected in winter or summer. The compounds identified in the guaviduca beverage were volatile secondary metabolites, which are of the same nature as those present in the essential oil. A total of 34 compounds were identified in the EO collected in winter and thirty compounds in the EO collected in summer, while in the beverage there were twenty-three volatile compounds. The chemical compounds found in the PCW and PCS were mainly grouped into oxygenated monoterpenes and aliphatic monoterpene hydrocarbons. The presence of safrole in the beverage was lower than in the essential oil, with a concentration of 2.43 ± 0.12 mg/L; however, this level is higher than the recommendations in Europe and China (a maximum of 1 ppm). This study of the chemical volatile compounds present in 
 <italic>P. carpunya</italic> and in the guaviduca beverage contributes to our knowledge concerning the use traditional of this species. Despite the fact that guaviduca beverage contains beneficial compounds such as 1,8-cineole and β-ocimene, also contains safrole, which is a compound that is harmful to health. It was determined that safrole is present in beverage in an amount not acceptable for the international committees (US EPA, IFRA, SFDA of China, etc.). Further studies should be conducted to determine the antimicrobial and mainly, the cholinesterase inhibitory activity from the major compounds, to value the real potential of the essential oil from guaviduca despite the presence of safrole. Letal acute toxicity in mice can be proposed for a further study.
