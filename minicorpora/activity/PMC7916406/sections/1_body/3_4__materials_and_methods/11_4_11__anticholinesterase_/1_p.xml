<p>The AChE inhibitory activity was measured using the spectrophotometric method developed by Ellman, et al. [
 <xref rid="B61-plants-10-00338" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], with slight modifications as suggested by Rhee, et al. [
 <xref rid="B62-plants-10-00338" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Acetylthiocholine was used as the substrate to detect the inhibition of AChE. The reaction mixture contained 40 µL of Buffer C (Tris–HCl, 50 mM, pH 8, containing 0.1 M of sodium chloride and 0.02 M of magnesium chloride hexahydrate), 20 μL of the tested sample solution, 20 µL of AcSCh (15 mM, PBS pH 7.4), and 100 µL of DTNB (3 Mm, dissolved in Buffer C). The mixture was pre-incubated for 3 min at 25 °C. Finally, the enzymatic reaction was started with the addition of 20 µL of 0.5 U/mL AChE (137 U/mg solid) and then incubated at 25 °C for 30 min. The amount of product released was monitored in an EPOCH 2 (BIOTEK 
 <sup>®</sup>) microplate reader every 1 min at 405 nm. All reactions were performed in triplicate in a 96-well microplate. Tested sample solutions from the essential oil were made by dissolving 10 mg in 1 mL MeOH. Two more dilutions were included in MEOH (10× dilution) to obtain final concentrations (1000, 100, and 10 ug/mL) of essential oil in MeOH. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> value was calculated by curve fitting of data (non-linear regression analysis, PRISM 8.0.1, GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA). Donepezil was used as positive control. Any increase in absorbance because of spontaneous hydrolysis of the substrate was corrected by subtracting the absorbance at the end of pre-incubation from the absorbance measured after the addition of the enzyme. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> value was measured from the corresponding rate of the reaction curve with Graph Pad v8.0.1.5.
