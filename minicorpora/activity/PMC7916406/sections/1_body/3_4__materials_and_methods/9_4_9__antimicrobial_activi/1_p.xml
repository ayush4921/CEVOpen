<p>Antimicrobial activity was determined against five Gram-negative bacteria (
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (ATCC 27853), 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> (ATCC 9997), 
 <italic>Proteus vulgaris</italic> (ATCC 8427), 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (ATCC 25922), 
 <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> (LT2)) and two Gram-positive bacteria (
 <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> (ATCC 29212) and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (ATCC 25923)), according to the procedure previously described by Valarezo et al. [
 <xref rid="B57-plants-10-00338" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The bacterial strains were incubated in Müeller–Hinton (MH) broth and DMSO was used to dissolve the essential oil. Gentamicine was used as a positive control for 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>K. pneumonia</italic>, 
 <italic>P. vulgaris</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, and ampicilline for 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic> and 
 <italic>S. typhimurium</italic>. DMSO was used as a negative control and the results are reported as minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) (the lowest concentration of sample capable of inhibiting all visible signs of growth of the microorganism).
