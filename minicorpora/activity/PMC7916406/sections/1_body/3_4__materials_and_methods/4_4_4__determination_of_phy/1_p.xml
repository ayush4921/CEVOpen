<p>Three physical properties were determined for the essential oil: relative density, refractive index, and optical rotation. The standard AFNOR NF T 75-111 [
 <xref rid="B52-plants-10-00338" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] (equivalent to the standard ISO 279:1998) was used to determine the relative density, the standard AFNOR NF T 75-112 [
 <xref rid="B52-plants-10-00338" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] (similar to ISO 279:1998) for the refractive index, and the standard method ISO 592:1998 for optical rotation. For relative density, an analytical balance (model Mettler AC 100, ±0.0001) and a pycnometer (1 mL) were used; for refraction index, a refractometer (model ABBE) was used; and for optical rotation, an automatic polarimeter (model Mrc-P810) was used. Measurements were performed at 20 °C and repeated three times.
