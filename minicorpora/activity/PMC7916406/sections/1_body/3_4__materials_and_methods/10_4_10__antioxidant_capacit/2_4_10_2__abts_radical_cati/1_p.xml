<p>The ABTS antioxidant method was performed according the modifications of Thaipong et al. [
 <xref rid="B59-plants-10-00338" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] to the initial procedure described by Arnao et al. [
 <xref rid="B60-plants-10-00338" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Briefly, the ABTS radical cation (ABTS•+) was produced after the reaction for 12 h of equal volumes of two stock solutions (7.4 µM ABTS and 2.6 µM potassium persulfate). After that, an ABTS standard solution was prepared by dissolution in methanol until reaching an absorbance of 1.1 ± 0.02, at a wavelength of 734 nm. The antiradical evaluation was evaluated when 2850 µL of the ABTS standard solution was allowed to react with 150 µL of the 
 <italic>P. carpunya</italic> essential oil at different concentrations, at room temperature, and protected from light for 2 h. Then, the final absorbance was registered. Similar to the DPPH analysis, BHT and Trolox were used as positive controls, while deionized water was used as blank control. ABTS radical scavenging activity was calculated by: SA (%) = (Ao − Ai)/Ao * 100%, where Ao represents the absorbance of the ABTS•+ reaction with the blank control, and Ai is the final absorbance of ABTS•+ after reacting with the essential oil or positive controls. The SC
 <sub>50</sub> was determined by comparing the graph of SA (%) against the concentration of essential oil. Every analysis was performed in triplicate and the average value was reported.
