<p>The procedure was performed according to Brand Williams et al. [

 <xref rid="B59-plants-10-00338" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The method consists in the preparation of a stable solution of DPPH with methanol until the absorbance is adjusted to 1.1 ± 0.02 units at a wavelength of 515 nm in a UV spectrophotometer (Genesys 10S UV.Vis Spectrophotometer, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). For the antiradical evaluation, 2850 µL of DPPH solution were allowed to react with 150 µL of 
 <italic>P. carpunya</italic> essential oil at different concentrations, at room temperature and protected from light for 24 h. After that, the final absorbance was measured at the same wavelength. The same procedure was followed for positive controls BHT and Trolox, while methanol was used as a blank control.
