0: Piper carpunya Ruiz & Pav.
1: is an aromatic shrub native to Ecuador, the leaves of which are used to prepare the traditional beverage Guaviduca.
2: Different health benefits are attributed to the guaviduca beverage, which is consumed as a traditional and folk medicine.
3: In this study, fresh   P. carpunya leaves were collected in the winter and summer and subjected to hydrodistillation for the extraction of the essential oil.
4: The guaviduca beverage was prepared by infusion in water and the volatile compounds were isolated by liquidliquid extraction.
5: Chemical composition and enantioselective analyses were performed by gas chromatography.
6: The antibacterial activity was assayed against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
7: The scavenging radical properties of the essential oil was evaluated by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydryl (DPPH) and 2,2-azinobis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) assays.
8: The acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity was measured using the spectrophotometric method.
9: The chemical analysis allowed us to identify more than 98% of the compounds in all samples.
10: The main constituent of the essential oil was 1,8-cineole (25.20  1.31%) in   P. carpunya collected in winter and (17.45  2.33%) in   P. carpunya collected in summer, while in the beverage, there was 14 mg/L.
11: Safrole was identified in the essential oil (PCW 21.91  2.79%; PCS 13.18  1.72%) as well as in the beverage (2.43  0.12 mg/L).
12: Enantioselective analysis was used to investigate the enantiomeric ratio and excess of four chiral components.
13: The essential oil presented a strong activity against   Klebsiella pneumoniae with a MIC of 500 g/mL and a very strong anticholinesterase activity with an IC  50 of 36.42  1.15 g/mL.
