0: One of the main goals of World Health Organization (WHO) is to end the epidemics of neglected tropical diseases, tuberculosis (TB) and malaria (which remains the major public health and mortality problem in the tropics) by 2030 [ 1,  2].
1: In 2018, TB infected about 10.0 million people, mainly in WHO regions of South-East Asia (44%), Africa (24%) and the Western Pacific (18%); in parallel, about 213 million cases of malaria were found in the WHO African region.
2: In the same year, half a million newly rifampicin-resistant TB cases were estimated.
3: In general, 3.4% of new TB cases and 18% of formerly cured patients displayed either multidrug resistant TB or rifampicin-resistant TB (MDR/RR-TB) [ 3 5].
4: Trying to overcome the high cost or the shortage of drugs for treatment of malaria remains a challenge for chemists, and some authors proposed the synthesis of compounds disclosing an imidazole unit with efficient activities against malaria [ 6].
5: Recently, Al-Otaibi et al.
6: [ 7] reported quantum calculations achieved on such derivatives; in their work, the authors evaluated the structural and electronic traits of those derivatives.
7: 1H- and  13C-NMR spectroscopy is a central tool in the structure elucidation of organic compounds.
8: A review by Lodewyk et al.
9: [ 8] emphasized on computational predictions of NMR data on synthetic organic compounds and natural products.
10: Natural products can be isolated from plants, which are considered to be an important source of major compounds in drug development because of their successful use in treating various human ailments since millenniums.
11: In this context, searching for new natural products from medicinal plants could provide new ways for antimalarial and antitubercular drugs.
12: Among these plants, some species of the genus  Cordia (Boraginaceae) are reported to be useful in the treatment of tuberculosis, bronchitis and malaria [ 9].
