0: Despite the intensive work performed on some  Cordia species, no or less investigation has been done on  Cordia batesii species, maybe because of its limited geographic location.
1: In our continuing search of secondary metabolites with powerful antiplasmodial and antitubercular activities, chemical investigations were carried on the stems of  Cordia batesii, a forest shrub growing in the central and western regions of Cameroon.
2: This paper describes the isolation of a new derivative of  1 named batesiin ( 2) along with other compounds.
3: In vitro activities regarding extracts of stems and some isolated compounds against two CQR strains of  Plasmodium falciparum were examined, when essential oil from the plant was tested against a resistant mycobacterial strain of  Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
4: The detailed characterization of  2 was investigated based on experimental NMR and UVvisible spectroscopic analyses; DFT at B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) [ 28,  29] and MPW1PW91/6-31G+(d,p) [ 30,  31] and TD-DFT simulations at B3LYP/6-31G+(d,p) were then undertaken on the alleged structure.
5: These quantum calculations were applied on  2 for two main reasons: the compound is described for the first time, its NMR data are closed to chemical shifts of  1 but the UVvisible spectra of both seem different.
6: DFT calculations at B3LYP/6-311G++(d,p) were also performed to check some electronic and thermodynamic properties of  2.
