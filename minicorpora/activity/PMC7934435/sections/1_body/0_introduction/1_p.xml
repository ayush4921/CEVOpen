<p id="Par4">One of the main goals of World Health Organization (WHO) is to end the epidemics of neglected tropical diseases, tuberculosis (TB) and malaria (which remains the major public health and mortality problem in the tropics) by 2030 [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In 2018, TB infected about 10.0 million people, mainly in WHO regions of South-East Asia (44%), Africa (24%) and the Western Pacific (18%); in parallel, about 213 million cases of malaria were found in the WHO African region. In the same year, half a million newly rifampicin-resistant TB cases were estimated. In general, 3.4% of new TB cases and 18% of formerly cured patients displayed either multidrug resistant TB or rifampicin-resistant TB (MDR/RR-TB) [

 <sup>1</sup>H- and 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectroscopy is a central tool in the structure elucidation of organic compounds. A review by Lodewyk et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] emphasized on computational predictions of NMR data on synthetic organic compounds and natural products. Natural products can be isolated from plants, which are considered to be an important source of major compounds in drug development because of their successful use in treating various human ailments since millenniums. In this context, searching for new natural products from medicinal plants could provide new ways for antimalarial and antitubercular drugs. Among these plants, some species of the genus
