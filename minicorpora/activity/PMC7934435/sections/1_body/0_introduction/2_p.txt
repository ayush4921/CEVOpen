0: The genus  Cordia (Boraginaceae) is composed of trees or shrubs and is widespread in Central and South America, India, Asia and Africa [ 10].
1: Previous phytochemical investigations of plants from this genus reported the isolation and characterization of different classes of secondary metabolites including naphthoquinones, hydroquinones [ 11] or polyphenols [ 12].
2: Concurrently and based on some pharmacological surveys, essential oils from  C.  curassivica and  C.  gilletii appeared as active against some microbial strains [ 13,  14].
3: Biological activities and in silico investigations of  C.  dichotoma were recently reported [ 15]; the plant is also known to contain, apart from allantoin ( 1) [ 16,  17] which has been the subject of many quantum calculations [ 18,  19], fatty acids (FA) [ 20].
4: FA have been recognized as energy sources for  M.  tuberculosis inside host tissues and are supposed to induce dormancy in  Mycobacterium bacilli [ 21,  22].
5: A few  Mycobacterium bacilli were inhibited by  C.  sebestena extracts as results of biological analyses [ 23].
6: Sebestenoid D is a component of the latter species and was a matter of density functional theory (DFT) studies, with its optimized molecular geometry and HOMOLUMO plot as outcomes [ 24,  25].
7: Highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) were also calculated during a survey aiming to check the coherence between experimental and theoretical NMR and IR data; this investigation was done on a compound with an imidazole unit [ 26] like allantoin ( 1).
8: Other simulations completed on a particular range of complex natural products involved IR as well as electronic transitions for UV analyses through time dependent DFT (TD-DFT); findings were afterwards compared to experimental results [ 27].
