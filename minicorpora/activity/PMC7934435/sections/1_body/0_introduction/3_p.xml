<p id="Par6">Despite the intensive work performed on some 
 <italic>Cordia</italic> species, no or less investigation has been done on 
 <italic>Cordia batesii</italic> species, maybe because of its limited geographic location. In our continuing search of secondary metabolites with powerful antiplasmodial and antitubercular activities, chemical investigations were carried on the stems of 
 <italic>Cordia batesii</italic>, a forest shrub growing in the central and western regions of Cameroon. This paper describes the isolation of a new derivative of 
 <bold>1</bold> named batesiin (
 <bold>2</bold>) along with other compounds. In vitro activities regarding extracts of stems and some isolated compounds against two CQR strains of 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> were examined, when essential oil from the plant was tested against a resistant mycobacterial strain of 
 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>. The detailed characterization of 
 <bold>2</bold> was investigated based on experimental NMR and UV–visible spectroscopic analyses; DFT at B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and MPW1PW91/6-31G+(d,p) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and TD-DFT simulations at B3LYP/6-31G+(d,p) were then undertaken on the alleged structure. These quantum calculations were applied on 
 <bold>2</bold> for two main reasons: the compound is described for the first time, its NMR data are closed to chemical shifts of 
 <bold>1</bold> but the UV–visible spectra of both seem different. DFT calculations at B3LYP/6-311G++(d,p) were also performed to check some electronic and thermodynamic properties of 
 <bold>2</bold>.
