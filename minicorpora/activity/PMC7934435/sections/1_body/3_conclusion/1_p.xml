<p id="Par23">Batesiin (
 <bold>2</bold>) has been characterized for the first time by means of 
 <sup>1</sup>H-, 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR and UV spectroscopies; its structure was confirmed by DFT and TD-DFT calculations at B3LYP/6-31G(d,p), 6-31G+(d,p), 6-311G++(d,p) and MPW1PW91/6-31G+(d,p) from this study. The MeOH crude extract of the stems showed a moderate activity against Dd2 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>falciparum</italic> strain with IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 50 μg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>. The antiplasmodial properties of 
 <bold>2</bold> and some other compounds are deduced from high percentages of growth inhibition against the 7G8 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>falciparum</italic> strain; in parallel, antimycobacterial activities against 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>tuberculosis</italic> arise from the essential oil equivalent to the mixture of FA (
 <bold>9</bold>–
 <bold>14</bold>) with a MIC = 9.52 μg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>. Additional data corresponding to HOMO, LUMO, enthalpy, entropy or some reactivity descriptors like 
 <italic>IP</italic> or 
 <italic>EA</italic> were also simulated, this time at B3LYP/6-31G(d) and 6-311G++(d,p) and compared with data from literature of allantoin (
 <bold>1</bold>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]; moreover, no comparison with the experiment in this case could be made. This work supports a good agreement between experimental data and DFT calculations in case of structure elucidation. These preliminary results also support the hypothesis of further development of new antimalarial and antitubercular drugs from the genus 
 <italic>Cordia</italic>.
