<p id="Par21">Results from bioassays against 7G8 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> strain reveal that an increase in concentration (10 to 100 μg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) marks an increase in percentages of inhibition for MeOH extract, 
 <bold>2</bold> and 
 <bold>3</bold>, but a decrease (with a negative percentage) for 
 <bold>5</bold>, which should indicate that the latter is totally inactive at high concentrations. The moderate activity of the MeOH extract suggests insufficient synergistic or additive effects of potential antiplasmodial secondary metabolites from 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>batesii</italic>. In contrast to the mixture of FA, the weak antimycobacterial properties of the crude extract suggest the occurrence within 
 <italic>C. batesii</italic> of components with very poor antimycobacterial effects (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Moreover, a report from literature indicates that mycobacteria have a lipid-rich hydrophobic cell wall and are often susceptible to less polar compounds [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], bacteriostatic activity has been defined as a ratio of MBC to MIC of &gt; 4. Hence, essential oil exhibited bacteriostatic activity.
