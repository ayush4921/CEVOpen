<p id="Par22">The high value of the HOMO–LUMO band gap is indicative of a relative stability of the molecule towards oxidation–reduction reactions. However, it is less than the HOMO–LUMO band gap of allantoin (
 <bold>1</bold>) (see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>) at the same method, maybe as an expression of additional stability of 
 <bold>2</bold> and difference in biological behavior between both chemical entities. Plots of frontier orbitals show that HOMOs and LUMOs are globally focused over the entire molecule. Meanwhile, in the case of HOMOs, the ureidyl moiety is less concerned by the orbital overlap whereas it is recognized as the area covering the positive phase in LUMOs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The theoretical 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR values are, on the average, higher than the experimental ones when using MPW1PW91/6-31+G(d,p); by contrast, it is not the same observation with results provided by the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) process. Regardless of the difference in the absolute values, the theoretical values match nicely with the experimental data. Based on the simulated UV–visible spectrum, batesiin (
 <bold>2</bold>) should most likely appear as an intermediate between various iminols and iminolates groups, precisely due to additional stability as already hypothesized (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). Two free protons are supposed to be located somewhere between, in each case, a nitrogen and an anionic oxygen of the same iminolate group, at a site however nearer to oxygen (distance &lt; 1.4 Ǻ) than to nitrogen (distance &gt; 2.3 Ǻ) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). Hence, a virtual loss of symmetry becomes noticeable within 
 <bold>2</bold>, inducing a change in MOs with an impact on electronic transitions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>). LUMO and LUMO + 1 are localized on one imidazole fragment (especially in the region covering a free proton and the anionic oxygen located in its neighborhood) when the other one looks totally unoccupied. Moving from HOMO-1 to HOMO-3 causes an increase in orbital overlap within the entire chemical entity. Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref> expresses the nature of electronic transitions which are in agreement with the corresponding λ
 <sub>max</sub>, depending on the nature of the solvent.
