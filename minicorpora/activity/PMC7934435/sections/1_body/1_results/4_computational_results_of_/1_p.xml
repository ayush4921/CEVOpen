<p id="Par16">The structure of compound 
 <bold>2</bold> was assigned based on spectroscopic analyses including, UV, IR, 
 <sup>1</sup>H- and 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR, 1D and 2D techniques. To get supplementary detailed awareness into the structure, DFT calculations were completed. The structure of the compound with the right stereochemistry was firstly optimized at B3LYP method using 6-31G(d) basis set and the optimized structure was submitted to a relaxed scan around one H–C(5)–N(6)–H dihedral angle. Secondly, an additional relaxed scan around the other H–C(5)–N(6)–H dihedral angle (with no change in basis set) was applied on a conformer with low energy got from the preceding step. The desired conformer still with low energy was thereafter subjected to two relaxed scans around the C(5)–N(6)–C(7)–N(6) dihedral angles. All these scans led to an optimized geometry for 
 <bold>2</bold>, based on the 
 <italic>cis</italic>-relationship between H–C(5)–N(6)–H (
 <sup>3</sup>
 <italic> J</italic>(H,H) = 2.0 Hz). It is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and takes in account previous reports on 
 <bold>1</bold> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. The five membered ring is almost planar as observed in the case of allantoin (
 <bold>1</bold>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].
