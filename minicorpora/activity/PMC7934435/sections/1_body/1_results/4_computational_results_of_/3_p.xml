 <sup>1</sup>H- and

 <italic>d</italic>
 <sub>6</sub> on 500 and 125Â MHz spectrometers respectively. The theoretical NMR were calculated at B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) and MPW1PW91/6-31+G(d,p) in DMSO. The chemical shifts were also simulated at B3LYP/6-31G(d), B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p), MPW1PW91/6-31G(d) and MPW1PW91/6-31G(d,p); however, the correlation with the experiment was relatively weak. GIAO (Gauge Invariant Atomic Orbital) formalism was used during these calculations, and the solvent effect was introduced through polarizable continuum model (PCM) by applying integral equation formalism (IEF). A comparison of the theoretical 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR values at B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) and MPW1PW91/6-31+G(d,p) with the experimental ones is given in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>. A better correlation with the experiment can be achieved if a scaling factor is applied to the 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR theoretical values.
