<p id="Par11">Lakshmanan et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] confirmed through an X-ray analysis that the occurring enantiomer of 
 <bold>1</bold> is its (
 <italic>S</italic>) one. A thorough analysis of all the spectra and comparison with data from the literature revealed that compound 
 <bold>2</bold> is described for the first time as a new derivative of allantoin (
 <bold>1</bold>); it was identified as (
 <italic>S</italic>,
 <italic>S</italic>)-1,3-bis(2,5-dioxoimidazolidin-4-yl)urea, trivially named batesiin (
 <bold>2</bold>). Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> shows some NMR data of allantoin (
 <bold>1</bold>) and batesiin (
 <bold>2</bold>); it strengthens the agreement of a close relationship between those two compounds in terms of NMR spectroscopic data.
