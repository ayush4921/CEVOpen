 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>batesii</italic> (500 g) were extracted with MeOH (5 × 500 mL, 30 min each) using an Elma
 <sup>®</sup> sonic S 100 at r. t. The extract was filtered; the filtrate was evaporated to dryness in a Rotavapor. The residue obtained from the MeOH extract (about 53 g) was dissolved into hexane–water 80:20 (100 mL) during 1 day; the resulting hexane–water gum (42 g) was dissolved in a mixture of CHCl
 <sub>3</sub>–H
 <sub>2</sub>O 80:20 (100 mL) once again in a period of 24 h; the resulting CHCl
 <sub>3</sub>–H
 <sub>2</sub>O extract (36 g) was dissolved in CH
 <sub>3</sub>COOH–H
 <sub>2</sub>O 70:30 (100 mL) during 24 h. The final extract (26 g) was submitted to further CC analyses. The crude MeOH extract (26 g) was subjected to CC of LH-20 (2.5 cm, 50 cm, eluent MeOH). Four main fractions were obtained: A (10.36 g), B (4.6 g), C (3.0 g) and D (7.0 g). Fraction A (10.36 g) was subjected to a silica gel CC (1.8 cm, 3 × 50 cm, eluent CH
 <sub>2</sub>Cl
 <sub>2</sub>–MeOH 100–1:1) and provided three sub-fraction (A
 <sub>1</sub>, A
 <sub>2</sub>, and A
 <sub>3</sub>). Sub-fraction A
 <sub>2</sub> (5.20 g) was fractionated by silica gel CC (1.8 cm, 3 × 50 cm, eluent CH
 <sub>2</sub>Cl
 <sub>2</sub>–MeOH 50:1–30:1) to produce two compounds, 
 <bold>4</bold> (4.6 mg) and 
 <bold>5</bold> (11 mg). Fraction B (4.6 g) was chromatographed as described above to give five sub-fractions (B
 <sub>1</sub>, B
 <sub>2</sub>, B
 <sub>3</sub>, B
 <sub>4</sub> and B
 <sub>5</sub>). Sub-fraction B
 <sub>1</sub> (0.20 g) was purified by silica gel CC (1.8 cm, 3 × 50 cm, eluent CH
 <sub>2</sub>Cl
 <sub>2</sub>–MeOH 30:1–20:1) to yield compound 
 <bold>1</bold> (9 mg). Compound 
 <bold>2</bold> (7.5 mg) was isolated from sub-fraction B
 <sub>3</sub> (0.31 g) using a silica gel CC (1.8 cm, 3 × 50 cm, eluent CH
 <sub>2</sub>Cl
 <sub>2</sub>–MeOH 40:1–20:1). Sub-fraction B
 <sub>4</sub> (0.60 g) was fractionated and purified using a silica gel CC (1.8 cm, 3 × 50 cm, eluent CH
 <sub>2</sub>Cl
 <sub>2</sub>–MeOH 40:1–15:1) to provide 
 <bold>3</bold> (4 mg). The essential oil (sub-fraction A
 <sub>1</sub>, 0.60 g) resulting from the crude extract was analyzed by LC–MS, exhibiting compounds 
 <bold>6</bold>, 
 <bold>7</bold> and 
 <bold>8</bold>. A
 <sub>1</sub> was soluble in pure hexane and crystallized from pure CH
 <sub>2</sub>Cl
 <sub>2</sub>. 487 mg were analyzed by GC–MS which revealed the compounds 
 <bold>9</bold>, 
 <bold>10</bold>, 
 <bold>11</bold>, 
 <bold>12</bold>, 
 <bold>13</bold> and 
 <bold>14</bold>.
