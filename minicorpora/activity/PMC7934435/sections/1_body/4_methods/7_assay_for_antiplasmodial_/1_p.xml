<p id="Par30">The stems of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>batesii</italic> were evaluated for their antimalarial activity against 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> strains Dd2 and 7G8. For drug screening, SYBR green I-based fluorescence assay was setup as described by Smilkstein et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Sorbitol synchronized parasites were incubated under normal culture conditions at 2% haematocrit and 1% parasitemia in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of MeOH extracts of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>batesii</italic>. Artemisinin was used as positive control, while 0.4% DMSO was used as the negative control. After 48 h of incubation, 100 μL of SYBR Green I solution [0.2 μL mL
 <sup>−1</sup> of 10,000× SYBR Green I (Sigma Aldrich—France)] in lysis buffer [Tris (20 mM; pH 7.5), EDTA (5 mM), saponin (0.008%; w/v) and Triton X-100 (0.08%; v/v)] was added to each well. The microtiter plate was mixed twice gently with multi-channel pipette and incubated in dark at 37 °C for 1 h. Fluorescence was measured with a fluorescence multi-well plate reader (Perkin Elmer) with excitation and emission wavelength bands centred at 485 and 530 nm, respectively. The fluorescence counts were plotted against the drug concentration and the inhibitory percentage of each plant extract and compound was calculated using the following equation:
