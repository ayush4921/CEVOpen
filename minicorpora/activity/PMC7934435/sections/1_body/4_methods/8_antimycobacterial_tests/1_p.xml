<p id="Par31">For the present study, the mycobacterium (
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>) used was a clinical isolated strain resistant to isoniazid codified as AC 45 (this strain was obtained from Sangmelima district’s Hospital in south region of Cameroon). The genetical profile of the resistance has been carried out at Laboratory for Tuberculosis Research (Biotechnology Centre, University of Yaoundé I) through Line probe Assay method. The mycobacteria strains have been cultured at 37 °C for 2 weeks in Middlebrook 7H9 (Himedia, India) supplemented with 0.05% (v/v), 2% glycerol and 10% OADC (oleic acid-albumin-dextrose-catalase of Liofilchem s.r.l, Italia). The optical density of 0.45 to 0.55 was measured using spectrophotometer at 550 nm to obtain a suspension of 1.5 × 108 UFC mL
 <sup>−1</sup>. The activity of all phytochemicals (extract and pure compounds) against the aforementioned 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> strains was tested using the microplate Alamar Blue assay as described previously by Collins and Franzblau [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. In a 96 well microplates, all wells received 100 μL of supplemented Middlebrook 7H9 broth, then working metabolites solutions (100 μL) were poured into the first well of each row, from which twofold dilution series were made through the microplate column. The test inoculum (100 μL) was added to all testing wells, as well as to the drug-free control wells. The final concentration of DMSO in wells was 7% v/v. The final concentrations tested ranged from 250 to 0.244 μg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> for pure compounds and 5000 to 4.882 μg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> for extracts. Rifampicin was used as standard drug. Each concentration was assayed in triplicate. Each microplate was sealed with parafilm paper and incubated for 14 days at 37 °C. After that, 40 μL of Alamar blue solution was added to two columns of each triplicate in order to show mycobacterial growth and the plates were re-incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. After 1 day of incubation, the MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of phytochemicals that inhibited the bacterial growth (prevents a color change from blue to pink) after incubation time [

For the MBC determination, 50 μL of each well which concentration was ≥ MIC was sub-cultured in 150 μL of Mbk 7H9 medium and incubated at 37 °C for 10 days, then mycobacterial growth was carried out by addition of 40 μL of alamar blue. MBC was defined as the lowest concentration of extract at which no visible growth of the germ was observed.
