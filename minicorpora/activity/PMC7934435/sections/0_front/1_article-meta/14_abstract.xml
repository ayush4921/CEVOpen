  <title>Background</title>
  <p id="Par1">Chemical and pharmacological investigations were performed on the stems of 
   <italic>Cordia batesii</italic> (Boraginaeae); chemical studies included quantum calculations applied on a newly described compound.

  <title>Results</title>
  <p id="Par2">A new derivative of allantoin (
   <bold>1</bold>) named batesiin (
   <bold>2</bold>) was characterized. Thirteen other known compounds involving allantoin (
   <bold>1</bold>) were either isolated or identified. GC–MS enabled the identification of six compounds from a fraction containing essential oil. MeOH extract and some isolated compounds were tested in vitro against 
   <italic>Pf</italic>7G8 CQS and 
   <italic>Pf</italic> Dd2 CQR strains of 
   <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>; extract disclosed a moderate antiplasmodial activity (IC
   <sub>50</sub> = 50 μg mL
   <sup>−1</sup>). Meantime, the CH
   <sub>2</sub>Cl
   <sub>2</sub> extract and essential oil fraction were tested on a resistant mycobacterial strain of 
   <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>; a potent antimycobacterial activity with a MIC = 9.52 μg mL
   <sup>−1</sup> was deduced from essential oil. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried on batesiin (
   <bold>2</bold>). Calculated chemical shifts at B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) and MPW1PW91/6-31G+(d,p) showed much better correlations with the experimental data. Time dependent DFT at B3LYP/6-31G+(d,p) displayed a major absorption band 3.01 nm higher than the experimental value.

  <title>Conclusion</title>
  <p id="Par3">
   <italic>Cordia batesii</italic> can be considered as promising in search of compounds with antimalarial and antitubercular properties. DFT studies are very helpful when trying to learn more about the spectroscopic insights of a derivative of allantoin (
   <bold>1</bold>).
