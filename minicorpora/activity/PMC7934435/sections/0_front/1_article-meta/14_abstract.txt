0: BackgroundChemical and pharmacological investigations were performed on the stems of    Cordia batesii (Boraginaeae); chemical studies included quantum calculations applied on a newly described compound.
1: ResultsA new derivative of allantoin (   1) named batesiin (   2) was characterized.
2: Thirteen other known compounds involving allantoin (   1) were either isolated or identified.
3: GCMS enabled the identification of six compounds from a fraction containing essential oil.
4: MeOH extract and some isolated compounds were tested in vitro against    Pf7G8 CQS and    Pf Dd2 CQR strains of    Plasmodium falciparum; extract disclosed a moderate antiplasmodial activity (IC   50 = 50 g mL   1).
5: Meantime, the CH   2Cl   2 extract and essential oil fraction were tested on a resistant mycobacterial strain of    Mycobacterium tuberculosis; a potent antimycobacterial activity with a MIC = 9.52 g mL   1 was deduced from essential oil.
6: Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried on batesiin (   2).
7: Calculated chemical shifts at B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) and MPW1PW91/6-31G+(d,p) showed much better correlations with the experimental data.
8: Time dependent DFT at B3LYP/6-31G+(d,p) displayed a major absorption band 3.01 nm higher than the experimental value.
9: ConclusionCordia batesii can be considered as promising in search of compounds with antimalarial and antitubercular properties.
10: DFT studies are very helpful when trying to learn more about the spectroscopic insights of a derivative of allantoin (   1).
