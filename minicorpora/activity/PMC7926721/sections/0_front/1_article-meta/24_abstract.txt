0: Using plant essential oils (EOs) contributes to the growing number of natural plants applications in livestock.
1: Scientific data supporting the efficacy of EOs as anti-inflammatory, antibacterial and antioxidant molecules accumulates over time; however, the cumulative evidence is not always sufficient.
2: EOs antioxidant properties have been investigated mainly from human perspectives.
3: Still, so far, our review is the first to combine the beneficial supporting properties of EOs in a One Health approach and as an animal product quality enhancer, opening new possibilities for their utilization in the livestock and nutrition sectors.
4: We aim to compile the currently available data on the main anti-inflammatory effects of EOs, whether encapsulated or not, with a focus on mammary gland inflammation.
5: We will also review the EOs antioxidant activities when given in the diet or as a food preservative to counteract oxidative stress.
6: We emphasize EOs in vitro and in vivo ruminal microbiota and mechanisms of action to promote animal health and performance.
7: Given the concept of DOHaD (Developmental Origin of Health and Diseases), supplementing animals with EOs in early life opens new perspectives in the nutrition sector.
8: However, effective evaluation of the significant safety components is required before extending their use to livestock and veterinary medicine.
