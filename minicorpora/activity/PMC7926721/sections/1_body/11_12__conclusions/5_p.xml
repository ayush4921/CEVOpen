<p>Emerging studies in cattle indicate an improvement in ruminant performance and feed efficiency when EOs are given in the diet [

 <xref rid="B231-antioxidants-10-00330" ref-type="bibr">231</xref>], which may add perspective in using EOs in animal nutrition. These positive effects might be partially due to the modulation exerted on the ruminal microbiota, increasing the fiber’s digestibility to produce volatile fatty acids and synthesize microbial protein as an energy and protein supply ruminant, respectively [

 <xref rid="B255-antioxidants-10-00330" ref-type="bibr">255</xref>]. Recent studies with thymol supplementation contrasted with the claimed in vitro antimicrobial activity of EOs: no positive effects on rumen metabolism (i.e., N and VFA) nor beneficial effects on rumen fermentation, nutrient utilization, and milk performance in dairy cows were observed, indicating the complexity of each EO effect per se. Care should be taken before assuming that the property of EOs is simply that of one characteristic component. Identifying a leading beneficial compound and the elucidation of the exact mechanism of action is complicated due to a plethora of compounds with different molecular structures, and antioxidant and antimicrobial activities. More in-depth knowledge of the mechanism of action and effects of individual compounds would allow the formulation of compounds with optimized efficacy and EOs’ inclusion in the diet.
