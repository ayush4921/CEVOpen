<p>Effectiveness of EOs in extending the shelf life and oxidative stability of dairy and meat products was proven [
 <xref rid="B147-antioxidants-10-00330" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>]. However, some issues are raised. EOs can negatively alter the product’s organoleptic properties due to their intense aroma, which may affect the consumer acceptability [
 <xref rid="B253-antioxidants-10-00330" ref-type="bibr">253</xref>]. Moreover, the possible interaction between EOs’ components and constituents, such as fats, carbohydrates, protein, and salts, should be considered. These reactions may reduce the antioxidant activity of these natural products [
 <xref rid="B147-antioxidants-10-00330" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>]. The synergistic effect of the combination of different EOs could address this issue since it allows lower concentrations of EOs combined with other compounds, thus enhancing their antioxidant effect.
