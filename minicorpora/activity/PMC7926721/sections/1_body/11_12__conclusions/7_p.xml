<p>In summary, our review identified EOs as a potential future therapeutic option in both ruminant and monogastric husbandries. EOs are unlikely to replace antimicrobials, but they can at least be used as a complementary treatment. The results of this review provide support for a need for additional in vitro and in vivo research focused on EOs as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial agents for recently emerging and challenging diseases in livestock and to improve animal-derived products. While many peer-reviewed studies about EOs were performed in humans and experimental models, more research is needed to evaluate the potential of EOs for the treatment of farm animals. </p>
