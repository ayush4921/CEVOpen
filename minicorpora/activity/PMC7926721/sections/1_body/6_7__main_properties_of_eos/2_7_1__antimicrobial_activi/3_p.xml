<p>EOs could affect the biosynthesis of lipids, including unsaturated fatty acids, thus modifying the cell membrane structure due to the hydrophobic characteristic. EOs in the bacterial cell, even in a concentration below the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), decrease the level of unsaturated fatty acids that are generally responsible for the membrane fluidity. For example, thymol, carvacrol, and eugenol can increase saturated fatty acids and decrease C18 unsaturated fatty acids. The action of EOs can also affect the enzymes responsible for the latterâ€™s biosynthesis [
