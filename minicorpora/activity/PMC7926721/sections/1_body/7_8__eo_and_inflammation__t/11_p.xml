<p>The resulting milk looks like an inflammatory exudate, hemorrhagic or sometimes purulent, exhibits the formation of flakes and clots, decreased protein, fat, and lactose contents. The exudate is infiltrated by cells migrated from the blood via diapedesis, mostly neutrophil granulocytes, and are defined as somatic cells (SC) [

Bovine mastitis causes a drop in milk production in the affected quarters. This decrease is most marked in the event of clinical mastitis. Subclinical inflammations can also reduce milk productivity by up to 40%. As a result, veterinary costs, pharmacological treatment, and milk wastage due to treatments impact the farmâ€™s profitability [
