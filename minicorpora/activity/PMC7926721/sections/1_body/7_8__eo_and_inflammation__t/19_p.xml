<p>Another study was conducted to evaluate the effect of 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> by intra-mammary infusion: 0.9 mL of EO was given twice a day for three days. 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> were not detected in milk after the treatment [

The intramammary infusion of sage EO to ewes affected with subclinical mastitis resulted in a significant decrease in somatic cell count 24 and 48 h post-treatment. On the other hand, Lefevre et al. treated 55 cases of mastitis with a mixture of EOs containing 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris, Rosmarinus verbenone,</italic> and 
 <italic>Laurus nobilis</italic> (1.5% each in 10 mL of sunflower oil), and 45 mastitis with a combination of 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> and 
 <italic>Rosmarinus verbenone</italic> (6% of each in sunflower oil or water). The results were unsatisfactory: The recovery rate was only 40% [
