<p>EOs obtained from different plants are a source of natural antioxidants [
 <xref rid="B156-antioxidants-10-00330" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>]. Most EOs have the virtue of being non-toxic—the literature has demonstrated that, compared to inorganic supplements, plant-derived products such as EOs are less toxic, residue-free, and thought to be ideal growth promoters for both milk and beef production and quality [

 <xref rid="B157-antioxidants-10-00330" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>]. In addition, transition metals such as Fe and Cu, often given as mineral supplementation, favor the formation of highly reactive free radicals in meat, accelerating its oxidation [

 <xref rid="B159-antioxidants-10-00330" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>]. However, in high concentrations, they can exert toxicity, such as necrosis. Hence, it is a common practice in the study of EOs, although not entirely correct, to identify natural antioxidants as “molecules able to react with radicals” or molecules that present the reducing power to counteract the oxidative stress caused by radicals [

 <xref rid="B160-antioxidants-10-00330" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>]. Accordingly, there are several methods used to examine the antioxidant properties of EOs. The most common tests used to screen the antioxidant activity of EOs are based on the in vitro reaction of the phytochemicals with some colored persistent radicals (e.g., 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH
 <sup>•</sup>) or 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) ABTS
 <sup>•+</sup> assay) (antiradical) or with some oxidizing nonradical species such as Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> ions (e.g., ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay) [

From a mechanistic point of view, these methods are classified as electron transfer (ET)-based assays, contrary to hydrogen atom transfer (HAT)-based assays, also widely used, which include oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay, radical-trapping antioxidant parameter (TRAP) assay, crocin bleaching assay using 2,2′-azobis-2-methyl-propanimidamide dihydrochloride (AAPH) as a radical generator, and β-carotene bleaching (BCB) assay [
