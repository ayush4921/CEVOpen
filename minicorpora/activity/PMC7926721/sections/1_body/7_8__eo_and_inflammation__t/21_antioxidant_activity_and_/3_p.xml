<p>Care should be taken before assuming that the antioxidant property of EOs is simply that of one characteristic component. Identifying a leading antioxidant compound and the elucidation of the exact mechanism of action is a herculean task due to the presence of a plethora of compounds with different molecular structures of antioxidant powers. However, EOsâ€™ chemical composition can allow to roughly predict its antioxidant potential, since it is expected that EOs containing higher amounts in phenolics and modest content in unsaturated terpenes display more robust antioxidant properties. One additional point should be considered concerning the antioxidant activity of EOs, and that is the enormous variability in chemical composition, even in EOs obtained from the same plant species, which hampers a direct comparison of published data. Such diversity is strictly connected to multiple factors, including geographic location, parts of the plant used, harvest time, environmental and agronomic conditions, phenological stage, and extraction methods [
