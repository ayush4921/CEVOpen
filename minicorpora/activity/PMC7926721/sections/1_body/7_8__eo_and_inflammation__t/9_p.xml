Mastitis or inflammation of the mammary gland develops when a pathogen crosses the teat canal barriers and multiplies in the milk. When the immune defense mechanisms fight this infection quickly and effectively, mastitis will be mild and transient. On the other hand, when the defense mechanisms are compromised, during parturition, or when the pathogen has evasion mechanisms against the immune system, mastitis will be more severe or become chronic [
