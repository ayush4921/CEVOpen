<p>The effects of dietary EO have been studied in the other primary livestock monogastric species, the chicken, albeit less intensively. The EOs have an evident immunomodulatory activity on mRNA expression in intestinal cells on IL-17A, Interferon (INF) α, INF-γ, Transforming growth factor (TGF) β, and IL-10 [

Carvacrol can decrease the inflammatory activity induced by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) treatment by downregulating the mRNA expression of some pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and of pathogen-associated molecular pattern membrane receptors, such as TLR2 and 4, and the downstream pathways related to them, such as NF-κB [

 <italic>Minthostachys verticillata</italic> EO with immunomodulatory activity on human T cells and anti-inflammatory activities showed its capability to increase macrophage phagocytosis and oxidative burst in a Balb/c mice model. Moreover, this EO can decrease neutrophil chemotaxis to the mammary gland, and downregulate pro-inflammatory cytokines’, such as IL-1β and TNF-α, mRNA expression. Consistently, the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 is also upregulated. Given that 
 <italic>M. verticillata</italic> EO was also shown to induce a decrease of the bacterial count in the glands of mice experimentally infected with 
 <italic>E. faecium</italic>, this model demonstrated that this EO could boost the innate immunity to help to resolve inflammation [
