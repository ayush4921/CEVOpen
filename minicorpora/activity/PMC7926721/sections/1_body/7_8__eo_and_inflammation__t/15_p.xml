<p>In vitro studies have been carried out to test the effects of selected EOs on the cells present in the mammary glands, such as epithelial mammary gland cells, or against bacteria involved in mastitis development. The activity of EOs against Methicillin-resistant

Biofilm production is a strictly coordinated process by which planktonic bacteria switch from free-floating forms to sessile anchored cells embedded in self-produced EPS [
