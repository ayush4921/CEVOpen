<p>New EO extraction techniques have emerged with many advantages in recent years, such as reducing extraction time, energy consumption, and solvents used and carbon dioxide emission [
 <xref rid="B55-antioxidants-10-00330" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Among these innovative techniques is solvent-free microwave extraction (SFME), a combination of heating plant samples using microwave energy followed by dry distillation at atmospheric pressure in the absence of any solvent. This methodâ€™s advantages are to obtain EOs with high yield and selectivity, shorter extraction time, and a green and safe process [

 <xref rid="B55-antioxidants-10-00330" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Generally, for extracting EO compounds, carbon dioxide fluid is used, and the obtained extract is not pure and further purification stages are needed. Also, water use at subcritical state is a powerful method for extracting EOs [
 <xref rid="B57-antioxidants-10-00330" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The subcritical water stage is reached when water pressure becomes higher than the critical pressure and temperature lower than the critical temperature, or vice-versa. This extraction method is considered the best alternative EO recovery technique since it enables a fast isolation process at a low working temperature [
