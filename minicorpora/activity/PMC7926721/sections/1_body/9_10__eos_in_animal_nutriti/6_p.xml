<p>Adding EOs to animal feed could affect the quality of fat in milk and meat, by inhibiting bacteria responsible for the bio-hydrogenation of unsaturated fat. It was also proven that supplementation in anise, nails clove, and juniper EOs improves the concentration of Conjugated Linoleic Acids and omega 3 in dairy goats [

 <italic>Capsicum</italic> and 
 <italic>Thymus</italic> EO with fibrolytic enzyme (obtained from 
 <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic>) to Farafra ewesâ€™ feeding increased the milk production, the feed efficiency, and the fat content in the milk. This mixture enhances the fiber digestibility by increasing the number of cellulolytic bacteria, causing an increase in the fat quantity. It also minimizes the energy and protein losses, causing an increase in milk production [
