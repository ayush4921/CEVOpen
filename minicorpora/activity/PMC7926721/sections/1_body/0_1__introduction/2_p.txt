0: In 2006, the European Union banned all antibiotics as animal growth promoters and proposed alternatives [ 6].
1: Natural products, such as medicinal plants, essential oils (EOs), and herbal extracts, are regarded as promising alternative agents [ 7].
2: EOs are among the most economically relevant plant-derived products, being frequently responsible for several species health-promoting properties.
3: These compounds are extracted from several plants generally localized in temperate to warm countries, like the Mediterranean and tropical countries, representing an important part of the traditional pharmacopoeia.
4: EOs are a mixture of low-molecular-weight molecules that include terpenes (monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes), alcohols, aldehydes, and ketones which, in addition to their bioactive molecules, are also responsible for the aromatic fragrance that these materials frequently exhibit [ 8].
5: Presently, over 3000 EOs are known, 10% of which are commercially and economically relevant.
6: These products are potential reservoirs of many bioactive compounds with several beneficial properties, and are aligned with current consumer preference for natural products [ 9].
7: They also offer the advantage of being better tolerated in the human body with fewer side effects [ 10].
