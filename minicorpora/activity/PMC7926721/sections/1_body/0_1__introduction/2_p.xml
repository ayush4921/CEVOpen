 <xref rid="B7-antioxidants-10-00330" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. EOs are among the most economically relevant plant-derived products, being frequently responsible for several speciesâ€™ health-promoting properties. These compounds are extracted from several plants generally localized in temperate to warm countries, like the Mediterranean and tropical countries, representing an important part of the traditional pharmacopoeia. EOs are a mixture of low-molecular-weight molecules that include terpenes (monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes), alcohols, aldehydes, and ketones which, in addition to their bioactive molecules, are also responsible for the aromatic fragrance that these materials frequently exhibit [

These products are potential reservoirs of many bioactive compounds with several beneficial properties, and are aligned with current consumer preference for natural products [
