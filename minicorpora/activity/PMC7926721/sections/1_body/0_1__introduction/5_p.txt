0: The potential use of EOs as new nutraceutical additives during early growth (pregnancy and/or lactation) has not been explored yet and might be a very promising way to limit the use of antimicrobials in livestock, according to the DOHaD (Developmental Origin of Health and Diseases) concept.
1: This concept was initially developed in humans by Barker [ 23, 24] and was extended more recently to animal science [ 25, 26].
2: This plan may raise early animals in an antibiotic-free production environment and drive heard performances and efficiency at later life, contributing to reduce antimicrobial resistance.
