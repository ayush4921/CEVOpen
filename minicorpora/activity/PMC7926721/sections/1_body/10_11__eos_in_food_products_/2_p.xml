<p>Several papers have demonstrated the inhibitory effect of EOs to extend the shelf life of beef burgers by controlling the proliferation of pathogenic bacteria through antimicrobial activity. This is due to hydroxyl groups’ presence in phenolic compounds (e.g., thymol, eugenol, carvacrol) which can degrade the bacterial cell wall, disturbing the phospholipid bilayer of the cytoplasmic membrane, causing leakage and cell death. They can further disrupt the proton motive force, electron flow, and active transport, coagulate the cell contents, impair enzymes involved in the energy regulation and synthesis of structural components [
