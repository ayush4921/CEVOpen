<p>EOs could be added to edible oils and fat to block unsaturated oilsâ€™ oxidative reaction, causing unpleasant taste and flavor production. The oxidation of fat could also produce some toxic compounds, such as aliphatic and aromatic ketones, carboxylic acids, aldehydes, esters, sulfoxides, phenols, anhydrides, quinones, and aliphatic and aromatic alcohols [
