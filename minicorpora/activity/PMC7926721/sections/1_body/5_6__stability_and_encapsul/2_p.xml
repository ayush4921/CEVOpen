<p>However, it has been repeatedly discussed that EOs’ valorization in innovative industries is not economically and practically ideal [

One of the crucial issues with using EOs as green and efficient bioactive molecules is their impact on the final product’s sensory properties. The EO required to inhibit microbial growth may compromise organoleptic properties (aroma and taste) and produce an undesirable effect [
