<p>Moreover, using encapsulation as a technological alternative to conceal EOsâ€™ highly undesirable taste has been repeatedly justified. Ghalem and Zouaoui suggested that adding

To overcome EO hydrophobic limitation, the outer protective layer, used in the encapsulation, acts as a hydrophilic barrier to EOs. In this context, Ben Jemaa et al. have pointed out that bulk thyme EO, with low water solubility, was roughly distributed in the medium and its action extent was therefore limited. On the contrary, when encapsulated in the nanoemulsion-based delivery system, its diffusion was homogeneously leading to more efficient antimicrobial activity [
