<p>Due to its antimicrobial activity, a commonly recognized potential activity of EOs is the inhibiting effect on methanogenic archaea responsible for methane production. This is one of EOs’ most widely recognized effects on ruminal fermentation and has been extensively explored (mainly in vitro) to reduce methane emissions from ruminants. Methane represents a loss of gross energy from feed and is considered a greenhouse gas. Thus, any reduction in methane derived from ruminal fermentation may enhance feed efficiency and reduce ruminant farming’s environmental impact. Nevertheless, although the reducing effects on ruminal methanogenesis have been shown by several studies testing a diversity of EO [

 <xref rid="B220-antioxidants-10-00330" ref-type="bibr">220</xref>], some results are also questionable, as Jafari showed in his review on the effects of oregano, carvacrol, and thymol on ruminal methanogenesis [
