<p>However, other observations have shown that some compounds may not be inhibitory depending on the EO and the dose used. Using microarray analysis, Patra and Yu observed that some Firmicutes (especially 
 <italic>Clostridia</italic>) and 
 <italic>Butyrivibrio</italic> were decreased by EOs, whereas 
 <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> (
 <italic>Prevotella</italic>) were increased. However, the effects were highly dependent on the type of EO supplemented [

 <italic>Ruminococcus flavefaciens</italic>, an important rumen fibrolytic bacteria [
 <xref rid="B208-antioxidants-10-00330" ref-type="bibr">208</xref>]. However, Kim et al. observed an increase in several bacterial species (
 <italic>Selenomonas ruminantium, Ruminococcus albus, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens,</italic> and 
 <italic>Ruminococcus flavefaciens</italic>) and in fungi in response to an EO mixture [
 <xref rid="B209-antioxidants-10-00330" ref-type="bibr">209</xref>]. Alagawany et al. reviewed the reported observations on effects of oregano and its main compounds (carvacrol, thymol) and found somewhat controversial effects.
