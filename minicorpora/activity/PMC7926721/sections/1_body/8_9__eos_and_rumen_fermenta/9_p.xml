<p>Summing up, the antimicrobial activity of some of the compounds contained in EO may affect the rumen microbiota. This may cause a shift in the ruminal fermentation pattern. Thus, in the derived digestion end-products that are either absorbed and used by the animal or disposed of as waste metabolites (methane or urea from ammonia), any effects of EO (at a given dose) must be the most selective as possible. Any broad and non-specific activity will cause a general inhibition of ruminal fermentation with no beneficial impacts on the ruminant. Any success on any of the targeted activities may significantly impact animal metabolism, feed efficiency, product quality, and environmental impact. However, the literature results show that these effects are highly dependent on EO type, source, applied dose, and the mixture of EOs. Effects can also be transient due to an adaptation of the microbiota to survive EOsâ€™ antimicrobial effects. Thus, although results may suggest some tendencies, not entirely conclusive outcomes can be drawn from the available information. As an example, although effects from both carvacrol and thymol have been demonstrated in vitro, recently, the authors of Reference [
 <xref rid="B222-antioxidants-10-00330" ref-type="bibr">222</xref>] have reported that no such effects on ruminal fermentation, animal productivity, and feed efficiency were observed in dairy cows in vivo.
