<p>The highest antioxidant activity was obtained on the first day of the analysis, before decreasing on day 10 and day 20. In the case of yoghurt samples with volatile basil, fennel and lavender oil, the greatest decreases in antioxidant activity were recorded between the 10th and the 20th day. In the case of the yoghurt sample with volatile mint oil, the greatest decrease in antioxidant activity was recorded between the first and the 10th day. These measurements show us that volatile basil, fennel and lavender oils have a higher antioxidant activity and are more stable during the first 10 days of preservation. In the case of volatile mint oil, it has a lower antioxidant activity and begins to stabilize after 10 days of preservation.</p>
