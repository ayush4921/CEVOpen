<p>The main purpose of this work is to create yoghurts with high antioxidant and antimicrobial capacity using only raw materials from Romania. External intake of antioxidants is essential to reduce the effects of daily stress. Volatile oils are an excellent source of antioxidants, and their use in food production can be a great direction for the current situation. Additionally, by using volatile oils, we aim to eliminate artificial preservatives added to yoghurts. According to studies in recent years, food preservatives harm consumer health, so using volatile oils with antimicrobial activity avoids the use of synthetic ones. To achieve this objective, we decided to enrich cow milk yoghurt with volatile oils encapsulated in sodium alginate. We used volatile oils from four aromatic plants: lavender, fennel, mint and basil. To achieve our purpose, we used the DPPH method to determinate antioxidant capacity, and the measurements were made on the first day after making yoghurt from cow’s milk, after 10 days and after 20 days. For each determination, we had two samples, a test sample (yoghurt with volatile oils) and a control sample (yoghurt without volatile oils). The yoghurt samples were packed in 150g plastic cups and stored in the refrigerator at a temperature between 0–4 °C. During the entire storage period, the glasses were covered with aluminum foil.</p>
