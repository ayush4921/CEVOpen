<p>To make the yoghurt enriched with bioactive components extracted from aromatic plants we used raw cowâ€™s milk with a physico-chemical composition representative of the lactation period, which we pasteurized, then cooled it and added lactic crops. For the inoculation operation, we used a starter culture from Hansen (product name: F-DVS YC-X11 Yo-Flex). This is a thermophilic culture formed from 
 <italic>Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus</italic> and 
 <italic>Streptococcus thermophillus</italic>. The volatile oils did not influence the process of obtaining yoghurt. Volatile oil compounds are gradually released into yoghurt due to its encapsulation in sodium alginate. The gradual release of antimicrobial and antioxidant action of volatile oils ensures a longer time of action and an avoidance of losses.
