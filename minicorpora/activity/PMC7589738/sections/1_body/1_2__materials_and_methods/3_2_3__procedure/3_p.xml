<p>For the extraction of volatile oils, we used mint, basil, lavender—dried and crushed aerial parts—and fennel seeds. The volatile oils were extracted by steam entrainment using the Neo-Clevenger apparatus modified by Moritz. The extraction time was five hours for each sample, and for efficient extraction, the plants were soaked the day before. At the end of the extraction, the volatile oil obtained was measured and 1 mL of benzene is added over it. It was then placed in a glass vial containing sodium sulfate anhydrous to remove any traces of water. Using a Pasteur pipette, we extracted the volatile oil from the glass vial and the benzene evaporated. To preserve the characteristics of the volatile oil until analysis, it was sealed in a dark ampoule and refrigerated.</p>
