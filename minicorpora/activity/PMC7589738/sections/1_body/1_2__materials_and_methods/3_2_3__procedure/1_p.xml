<p>In 2019—before deciding to make a food product with a high content of antioxidants—we conducted a market study and a sensory analysis for these types of yoghurts so that we can conclude whether the products made by us are to the liking of consumers. Following the sensory analysis, the tasters stated that the volatile oil added to the yoghurt only slightly influences its taste. The specific taste of yoghurt is predominant, only at the end, stimulating a slight taste of the plant from which the volatile oil is extracted. In addition to these two methods, we determined the pH and the lactic acid content to determine the antimicrobial activity of the yoghurt samples. To verify the antimicrobial activity of volatile oils, we created a mixture of the four oils studied and tested them on different cultures of enterobacteria, yeasts and molds. For the mixture of volatile oils, we used 25% volatile mint oil, 25% volatile lavender oil, 25% volatile basil oil and 25% volatile fennel oil. After obtaining the dilutions, the sowing took place on different culture mediums. The volatile oil mixture had a strong effect on colonies of enterobacteria, yeasts and molds: zero colony-forming units (CFU). No colony developed compared to the comparison plates (standard) [
