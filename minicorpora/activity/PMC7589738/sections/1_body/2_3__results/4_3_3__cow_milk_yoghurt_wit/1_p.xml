On the first day, the yoghurt sample with volatile basil oil showed the highest antioxidant activity, and on the 20th the lowest. The highest value from the first day was 9.65% and the lowest at 9.56%. On day 10 the highest value was 9.33%, and the lowest at 9.26%. On day 10 the antioxidant activity was lower than on the first day, but it was higher than on day 20. Day 20 showed the lowest antioxidant activity, and the lowest value was 8.65%. The average value for each day is 9.60% for the first day, 9.30% for the 10th day and 8.70% for the 20th day.
