The strongest antioxidant activity of the yoghurt sample with volatile mint oil was on the first day. The lowest value of this day was 1.57%, and the highest was 1.62%. The value of the antioxidant activity decreased on the 10th day compared to the first day. On day 10 the highest value was 1.23%, and the lowest at 1.17%. For this yoghurt sample, the lowest antioxidant activity was recorded on day 20. The highest value on day 20 was 1.06%, and the lowest was 0.95%. The average value for each day is 1.60% for the first day, 1.20% for the 10th day and 1.00% for the 20th day.
