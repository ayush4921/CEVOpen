0: The overall aim of this project was to evaluate therapeutic and toxicology activities of the essential oil of  P. hybridus subsp.
1: ochroleucus.
2: The hypotheses guiding the workplan were: (1) Essential oils from various plant parts vary in chemical composition and hence in therapeutic and toxicological effects.
3: (2) The essential oils will not cause skin irritation when applied externally.
4: To evaluate these hypotheses, we studied: (A) Pytochemistry (chemical profile) of essential oils from the leaves (above ground tissue) and rhizomes (below ground tissue) of  P. hybridus subsp.
5: ochroleucus.
6: (B) Antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-cholinesterase activities, as well as toxicological effects (in mouse and Drosophila), comparatively, for essential oils from the leaves and rhizomes.
7: (C) Skin irritation potential in humans, with external application of the leaf and rhizome essential oils.
8: Antimicrobial activity was evaluated against 20 pathogenic bacterial strains (10 laboratory reference strains and 10 strains isolated from human wound swabs).
9: Anti-inflammatory activity was studied in a Carrageenan-induced paw edema test with female Sprague Dawley rats.
