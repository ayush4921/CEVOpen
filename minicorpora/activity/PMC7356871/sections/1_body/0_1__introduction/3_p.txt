0: The present study focused on  Petasites hybridus subsp.
1: ochroleucus, (i.e., a subspecies of  Petasites hybridus) which is spread and used in traditional medicine mainly in the eastern, central and southern parts of the Balkans [ 1, 16], and is endemic to the southern Balkan region.
2: Very little information is available on this sub-species, which is distinguished from the more common and widely distributed, red-flowered subspecies  P. hybridus subsp.
3: hybridus, which is common in the northern and western parts of the Balkans, as well as in the rest of Europe.
4: We focused on the essential oil of this plant, which is a herbal preparation not commonly used in traditional practices of  Petasites hybridus and therefore has attracted little research-attention so far, but that has a potential for safe use since the toxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids are non-volatiles and are therefore usually not present in essential oils.
