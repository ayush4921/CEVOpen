<p>The overall aim of this project was to evaluate therapeutic and toxicology activities of the essential oil of 
 <italic>P. hybridus</italic> subsp. ochroleucus. The hypotheses guiding the workplan were: (1) Essential oils from various plant parts vary in chemical composition and hence in therapeutic and toxicological effects. (2) The essential oils will not cause skin irritation when applied externally. To evaluate these hypotheses, we studied: (A) Pytochemistry (chemical profile) of essential oils from the leaves (above ground tissue) and rhizomes (below ground tissue) of 
 <italic>P. hybridus</italic> subsp. ochroleucus. (B) Antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-cholinesterase activities, as well as toxicological effects (in mouse and Drosophila), comparatively, for essential oils from the leaves and rhizomes. (C) Skin irritation potential in humans, with external application of the leaf and rhizome essential oils. Antimicrobial activity was evaluated against 20 pathogenic bacterial strains (10 laboratory reference strains and 10 strains isolated from human wound swabs). Anti-inflammatory activity was studied in a Carrageenan-induced paw edema test with female Sprague Dawley rats.
