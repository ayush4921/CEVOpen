<p>Essential oils from leaves and rhizome are complex systems containing numerous compounds, as is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-09-00700">Figure S1 (supplemental)</xref>. Occurrence of the overlapped and embedded peaks is evident in the total ion chromatogram (TIC), as shown in the result of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis, especially with regard to teropenoids/sesquiterpenoids (compounds 16â€“62). First, the peaks from TICs obtained by GC-MS were identified by applying SIA. AMDIS was used for the deconvolution of these peaks and extraction of characteristic ion peaks originating from the specific compounds. After deconvolution, the purified mass spectrum of each peak was compared with the National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST) 08 database or the mass spectra of standards.
