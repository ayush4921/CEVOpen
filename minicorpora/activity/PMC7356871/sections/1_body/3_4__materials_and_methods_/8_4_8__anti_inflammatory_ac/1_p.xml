<p>Anti-inflammation activity of the essential oils was determined on Carrageenan-induced paw edema in Sprague Dawley rats, following Amdekar et al. (2012) [

 <italic>v</italic> λ-carrageenan analytical grade (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie Gmbh., Munich, Germany) in normal saline was injected into the subplantar tissue of the right hind paw. Plant essential oils, obtained from rhizomes and leaves, were dissolved separately in 2.5% DMSO (final volume 50 µL) and applied on the right hind paw of rats from the test groups, in concentrations of 10%, 20% or 40%. Oil was applied twice: first, immediately after the carrageenan injection, and again 3 hours later. The same volume (50 µL) of DMSO was applied to the right paw of animals from the control group. Paw thickness was measured before the carrageenan injection and 1, 2, 4 and 6 h after, using a digital caliper.
