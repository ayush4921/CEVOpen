<p>Larvae of 
 <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> Oregon-RC (wild-type flies, stock no. 5) ("Bloomington 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center", Indiana University, USA) fruit flies were used for toxicity testing. Fruit flies were cared for, grown, fed, mated and transferred to the treatment media as previously described [
 <xref rid="B30-plants-09-00700" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Larvae aged 72 Â± 4 h were washed with distilled water and transferred to the standard feeding media containing 0, 0.19, 0.38, 0.75, 1.5 or 3% 
 <italic>v/v</italic> of either rhizome or leaf oil extract from 
 <italic>P. hybridus</italic>. Each experimental/control group consisted of 3 replicas. Each replica contained 20 larvae. Number of pupae, hatched adults and adult mortality were recorded daily. The exposure period lasted until all individuals that were alive emerged from pupae, i.e., 7 and 13 days for the rhizome and leaf essential oil extracts, respectively. As each of the adults emerged from its pupae it was immediately transferred to a new essential oil extract-free feeding medium. Hatched adults were monitored for an additional 7 (rhizome oil group) or 14 (leaf oil group) days after emergence for any prolonged effects on adulthood survival.
