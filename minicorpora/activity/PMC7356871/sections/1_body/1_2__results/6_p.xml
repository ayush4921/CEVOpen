<p>The rhizome oil also affected the development of 
 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> larvae, and significantly delayed achievement of pupa stadium (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00700-f001">Figure 1</xref>). The effect was dose-dependent and highly significant when compared to the control (ANOVA overall effect 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 with significant Dunnett’s procedure, for concentrations of 0.75% and higher; chi-square test overall effect 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001 with Fischer’s exact test for each concentration vs. control 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt;&lt; 0.05). Development time is presented in 
 <xref rid="plants-09-00700-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. Compared to the control group, development time for the rhizome essential oil treatment was delayed by 24–60 h depending on the concentration used. In the case of the leaf essential oil, it was not always possible to estimate the development time due to the high mortalities. At the lower concentrations, however, the trend of a delayed pupa stadium was the same as that for the rhizome essential oil.
