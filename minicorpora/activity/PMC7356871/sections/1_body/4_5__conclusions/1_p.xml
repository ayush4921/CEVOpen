<p>Pyrrolizidine alkaloids were not present in the essential oil of 
 <italic>P. hybridus</italic> subsp. ochroleucus; concentrations of sesquiterpene esters were moderate, and sesquiterpene esters were present only in the rhizome’s essential oil, while essential oil from the leaves had high concentrations of sesquiterpene lactones. The essential oils showed no signs of toxicity to mice and no skin irritation potential in humans, and had no antimicrobial properties. However, they were found to have good local anti-inflammatory activity, a potential for use as an efficient insect repellent (leaves’ essential oils) and a potential value for the treatment of neurological disorders, due to their anticholinergic activity.
