<p>Essential oils from the leaves and rhizomes of 
 <italic>P. hybridus</italic> had a moderate anti-cholinesterase activity, with 33.24% and 26.37% inhibition for leaves and rhizomes essential oil, respectively (
 <xref rid="plants-09-00700-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Cholinesterase inhibitors are considered to delay the progression of dementia, and for now only several such inhibitors are officially registered. There is therefore a strong interest in identifying such compounds. Species from the Petasites genus are traditionally used for the treatment of migraine, which suggested their potential for the treatment of other neurological disorders including Alzheimerâ€™s disease e.g., acting as acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitors. The results indeed demonstrate an anticholinergic activity of the tested essential oils, and therefore their a potential value for the the treatment of neurological disorders, acting as AChE and BuChE inhibitors.
