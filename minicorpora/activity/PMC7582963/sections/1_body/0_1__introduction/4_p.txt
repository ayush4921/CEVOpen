0: Recent studies investigated the pharmaceutical application, chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oils extracted from seeds of  P. harmala [ 13].
1: However, there are few reports concerning the chemical composition and microbiological activity of oils extracted from  P. harmala seeds [ 14].
2: The present paper focuses on the tocols (i.e., tocopherols and tocotrienols) and fatty acid composition of seed oils of  P. harmala plants, collected from different regions of Tunisia.
3: Based on the wide geographic distribution of  P. harmala in Tunisia with semi-arid, arid and Saharan climatic zones, we hypothesized that the geographic origin of the plant affected the tocol and fatty acid contents of the oils extracted from seeds.
4: Various studies showed that tocols and fatty acids have many antifungal activities [ 15, 16].
5: Knowledge of bio-active components would highlight the importance of traditional uses of medicinal plants and enrich the global database of phytochemicals.
6: Plant compounds are usually influenced by geographical distribution.
7: In this study, the principal constituents and antifungal effect of Tunisian  P. harmala seed oil were addressed.
