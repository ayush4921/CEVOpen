<p>The tocols present in 
 <italic>P. harmala</italic> seed oils were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) according to the ISO 9936 standard. The HPLC system was equipped with a Shimadzu LC-20AT pump (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan), a Shimadzu RF 20A fluorescence detector (set at excitation and emission wavelengths of 295 and 330 nm, respectively) and a Rheodyne 7725i manual injector (Rohnert Park, CA, USA). The tocols were separated on a normal phase column (Hypersil silica, 15 cm length × 3 mm internal diameter, 3 µm particle size, Thermo Scientific) at ambient temperature and with mobile phase flow level of 0.5 mL/min. The mobile phase was a 99.5:0.5 (

 <italic>n</italic>-hexane/isopropanol mixture. The data were analyzed using the Shimadzu LC solution software Version 2.53. Of seed oil, 0.5 g was diluted with 50 mL of hexane, and 20 µL of this was injected into the column. A mixture of standard tocol isomers (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA.) was dissolved in hexane at 2 μg/mL each and used for identification and quantification of the HPLC peaks. The amount of tocols in extracts was calculated as mg tocols/100 g oil.
