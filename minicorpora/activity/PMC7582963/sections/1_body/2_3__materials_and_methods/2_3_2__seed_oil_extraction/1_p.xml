<p>The mature seeds collected from fruits were dried and then milled in a K/IKA-WERKE M20 grinder. The seed oil was extracted as follows: 80 g of ground seeds were placed in a cellulose paper cone mixed with 250 mL of 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane using a Soxhlet extraction apparatus for 8 h. The hexane was then removed by rotary evaporation (model R-210, Büchi, Flawil, Switzerland) at 80 °C and finally stored at −20 °C for further analysis. The oil content was expressed as the lipid content percentage on seed powder. All chemicals and reagents used were of analytical grade and were obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany), Sigma-Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany), Acros Organics (Fair Lawn, NJ, USA) and Fisher Scientific Co. (Leicestershire, UK).
