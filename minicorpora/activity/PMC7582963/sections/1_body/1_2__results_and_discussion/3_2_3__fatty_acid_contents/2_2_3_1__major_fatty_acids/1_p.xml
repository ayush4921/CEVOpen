<p>Five major fatty acids were identified in the six 
 <italic>P. harmala</italic> populations from Tunisia. Linoleic acid (C18:2) was the main component detected in 
 <italic>P. harmala</italic> oil. Previous studies also reported that linoleic acid was the most abundant fatty acid in 
 <italic>P. harmala</italic> seed oils, with contents ranging from 54.6% [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-25-04569" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] to 59.2% [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-25-04569" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The level of C18:2 from the southern and central Tunisia populations were 65.30% and 64.76%, respectively (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04569-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Oleic acid was the second most abundant fatty acid identified in 
 <italic>P. harmala</italic> oil, with 23.12%. Values were between 22.28% (for KO) and 24.34% (SE), showing a small difference to previous results [

 <xref rid="B24-molecules-25-04569" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Accessions collected from central Tunisia contained more than 24.0% C18:1, except for MH with 22.75%, whereas, in those from southern regions, the C18:1 content was less than 24% and the palmitic acid (C16:0) level was 5.36%. Other studies on 
 <italic>P. harmala</italic> seed oil reported similar palmitic acid contents of 7% [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-25-04569" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and 8.4% [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-25-04569" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].
