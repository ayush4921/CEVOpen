<p>The in vitro antifungal activity of 
 <italic>P. harmala</italic> seed oils against selected fungi is shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04569-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The inhibition values of mycelia growth varied from 31.53% (
 <bold>6</bold>) to 82.11% (
 <bold>3</bold>) at the ½ concentration. The ANOVA of antifungal activity data showed significant differences between the fungal isolates and the seed oil concentrations (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). In addition, we noted a significant fungal isolate × oil concentration interaction (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The minima and the maxima concentrations of mycelia growth inhibition varied depending on the fungi tested (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04569-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The 
 <italic>P. harmala</italic> seed oils exhibited excellent activity against (
 <bold>3</bold>) with mycelia growth inhibition ranging within 56–82%, followed by (
 <bold>8</bold>)–(
 <bold>10</bold>) with inhibitions of 15–55.7%, 20–54% and 5–58%, respectively. The seed oil showed moderate inhibition against (
 <bold>6</bold>), with range of 5.19–42%. The evaluated seed oils manifested promising antifungal activities against the tested fungi except for (
 <bold>5</bold>), which showed no inhibitory effect. Orange essential oil was found to have potential for controlling 
 <italic>A. dauci</italic> and 
 <italic>A. alternata</italic> [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-25-04569" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The preponderance of linoleic and oleic acids determined by GC-MS analysis of seed oil of the MD population reinforced the antifungal activity of 
 <italic>P. harmala</italic> shown in our study. This is consistent with other studies on the importance of linolenic, linoleic and oleic acids as essential components of seed oil of many plants such as 
 <italic>Pongamia pinnata</italic>, which exhibited a strong antifungal and antibacterial properties [
