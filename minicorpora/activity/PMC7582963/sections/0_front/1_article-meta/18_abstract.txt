0: This investigation included the chemical analysis of   Peganum harmala (  P. harmala) seed oil and its antifungal properties against 10 fungal species.
1: Seed oils of six populations were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatograph/mass spectrometry (GC-MS).
2: The HPLC analysis indicated that   P.   harmala seed oil exhibited a very high level of tocopherol contents, with values in the range of 2385.662722.68 mg/100 g. The most abundant tocopherol isomer was -tocopherol (90.39%), followed by -tocopherol (8.08%) and -tocopherol (1.14%).
3: We discovered for the first time the presence of tocotrenols in   P. harmala seed oils of the six populations studied.
4: The GC-MS analyses revealed that linoleic acid was the main fatty acid (65.17%), followed by oleic acid (23.12%), palmitic acid (5.36%) and stearic acid (3.08%).
5: We also studied the antifungal activity of seed oil of the Medenine (MD) population on ten fungal pathogens.
6: The antifungal effects differed among pathogens and depended on oil concentrations.
7: Seed oil of the MD population caused a significant decrease in mycelial growth of all fungi tested, with values ranging 31.5082.11%, except for   Alternaria sp., which showed no inhibition.
8: The antifungal activity against the 10 selected fungi can be explained by the richness in tocols of the extracted oil and make   P. harmala a promising crop for biological control.
9: Furthermore, the importance of fatty acids and the wide geographic spread in Tunisia of this species make this crop a potential source of renewable energy.
