 <bold>Evaluation of (-)-fenchone antisecretory mechanism in castor oil-induced intraluminal fluid accumulation (enteropooling) model: </bold>The effects on intestinal enteropooling were evaluated according to protocols described by Ezeja 
 <italic>et al</italic>[
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] adapted. Mice (
 <italic>n</italic> = 7 per group), after 24 h fasting, were orally pretreated with 5% tween 80 (vehicle 10 mL/kg), loperamide (5 mg/kg) or (-)-fenchone (150 mg/kg). After 60 min, the animals received orally 10 mL/kg of castor oil to induce diarrhea. After 1 h, the mice were euthanized, their abdomens were opened, and their intestines removed (pylorus ileocecal junction) and weighed with the intestinal contents (full intestine). The intestinal contents were removed and weighed again (empty intestine). Difference between the first and second weight is considered as the weight of the intestinal content of each animal.
