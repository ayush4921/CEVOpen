 <bold>Effect of (-)-fenchone on gastric emptying: </bold>The effect on gastric emptying was evaluated according to experiments conducted by Scarpignato 
 <italic>et al</italic>[
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Male Swiss mice (
 <italic>n</italic> = 7 per group), fasted for 24 h, orally received the vehicle (5% tween 80; 10 mL/kg), loperamide (5 mg/kg) or (-)-fenchone (37.5, 75, 150, 300 mg/kg). After 1 h the animals received the 10 mL/kg phenol red-colored marker (0.05% phenol red-colored in 1.5% carboxymethylcellulose-thickening agent). To the non-treated control group (the zero-time control group), the phenol red-colored marker was administrated and the mice were immediately euthanized. The treated groups received the same marker and were euthanized 30 min after administration. The abdominal cavity was opened; the pylorus and distal esophagus were clamped. The stomach was removed, opened, and washed with 7 mL of distilled water. Gastric contents were collected and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 min. Then, 1 mL of the supernatant was collected, and 1 mL of 1 mol/L NaOH (pH = 12) was added. The results were obtained by spectrophotometry with a wavelength reading of 560 nm and expressed as a percentage of gastric emptying, calculated by the formula: % Gastric emptying = (100 - mean absorbance of sample) / mean absorbance of zero-time control group Ã— 100.
