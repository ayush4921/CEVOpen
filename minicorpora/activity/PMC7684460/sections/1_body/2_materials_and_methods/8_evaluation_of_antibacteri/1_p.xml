Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination of the (-)-fenchone on bacterial and fungal strains was performed by the microdilution technique in 96 well plates. Initially, 100 μL of double concentrated RPMI/BHI broth was distributed to the wells of the microdilution plates. Then, 100 μL of (-)-fenchone was dispensed into the wells of the first line of the plate and by serial dilution at a ratio of two concentrations of 1024 μg/mL to 16 μg/mL were obtained. Finally, 10 μL of bacterial and fungal inoculum (strains of

 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> ATCC-25853 and LM-297, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> ATCC-18739 and LM-39, 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> ATCC-76645 and LM-05, 
 <italic>Candida tropicalis</italic> ATCC-13803 and LM-20, 
 <italic>Candida Krusei</italic> ATCC-6258 and LM-13) were added to the wells. Controls performed: Microorganisms and culture medium to check the viability of the strains and the sterility of the medium and control with Gentamicin (64 μg/mL) and amphotericin B (32 μg/mL). The prepared plates were sealed aseptically and incubated at 35 ± 2 °C for 24-48 h. The antimicrobial activity of the products was interpreted and considered as active or inactive according to the following criteria: Up to 600 μg/mL = strong activity; 600-1500 μg/mL = moderate activity; &gt; 1500 μg/mL = weak activity or inactive product[
