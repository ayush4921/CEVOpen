<p>To evaluate the antidiarrheal activity of (-)-fenchone the castor oil-induced diarrhea model was used in mice. Castor oil is a natural product obtained from the seeds of 
 <italic>Ricinus communis</italic>, that when ingested is metabolized by intestinal lipases, releasing ricinoleic acid in the intestinal lumen, creating extensive contractions in the transverse and distal colon[

 <sup>+</sup>, K-ATPase activity, inhibition of sodium, chloride, and water absorption, increased contractions of smooth intestine muscles, produces a cytotoxic effect on enterocytes, resulting in abundant watery diarrhea with an accumulation of intestinal fluid[
