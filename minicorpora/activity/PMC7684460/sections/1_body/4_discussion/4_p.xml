<p>An investigation was then carried out to determine whether fenchone can act through cholinergic mechanisms. Acetylcholine (ACh) exerts an excitatory effect on the gastrointestinal smooth muscle by activating muscarinic M
 <sub>3</sub> receptors (coupled to Gq/
 <sub>11</sub>), there is an increase in the cytosolic concentration of Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>, which results in contraction of the smooth muscle and increased intestinal transit[
