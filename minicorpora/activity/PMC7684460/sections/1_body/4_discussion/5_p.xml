<p>Pilocarpine, a cholinergic agonist, was used to induce intestinal motility. It can be seen that fenchone significantly reduced the stimulating effects promoted by pilocarpine resulting in a decrease of intestinal transit. From this result, we can infer that (-)-fenchone may be competing for GIT M
 <sub>3</sub> receptors, acting as a partial antagonist of muscarinic receptors and that its antimotility involves the cholinergic pathway. This result corroborates the study by Dos Santos Negreiros
