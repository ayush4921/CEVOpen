<p>NO is a neurotransmitter released by inhibitory enteric neurons and causes post-junction hyperpolarization responses resulting in smooth muscle relaxation[
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The K
 <sub>ATP</sub> channels are expressed in large quantities in the intestinal smooth muscle modulating gastrointestinal motility in physiological and pathophysiological states[
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. NO activates soluble guanylyl cyclase, leading to the production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) that enables its dependent protein kinase, which activates potassium channels[
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Activation of K
 <sub>ATP</sub> promotes hyperpolarization of the cell membrane, reduction of Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> influx and inhibition of cellular excitability, thus generating smooth muscle relaxation[
