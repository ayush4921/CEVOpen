0: Based on this criterion, the monoterpene (-)-fenchone (1,3,3-trimethylbicyclo[2.2.1] heptane-2-one) was selected for this study.
1: This monoterpene is made up of two enantiomers, (+)-fenchone and (-)-fenchone, obtained from fennel oil ( Foeniculum vulgares) and thuya oil ( Thuja occidentalis L.), respectively[ 26, 27].
2: Research shows that the (-)-fenchone isomer has antinociceptive activity[ 28], antimicrobial[ 29], anti-inflammatory and antioxidant[ 30, 31].
