<p>Tests demonstrated that (-)-fenchone maintained the MIC of 32 μg/mL and amphotericin B the MIC of 0.2 μg/mL for the strains tested, maintaining the MIC at equal values both individually and in an association. Since the FIC, that is, the ratio of the combined inhibitory concentrations between the isolated inhibitory concentrations, for each substance was equivalent to 1, the FICI was equal to 2 (Table 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).
