<p>(-)-Fenchone did not show inhibitory activity against any of the bacterial strains in the concentration range used. Thus, for bacterial strains, it was not possible to determine the MIC and minimum bactericidal concentration. The results of the antifungal activity (Table 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) shown that (-)-fenchone inhibited the growth of 4 (66%) of the six fungal strains studied up to a concentration of 32 μg/mL, with only two strains being inhibited to a concentration of 64 μg/mL. Therefore, the MIC50 (level capable of inhibiting the growth of up to 50% of the species) was considered to be 32 μg/mL MFC of the product against fungal strains varied between 32 μg/mL and 256 μg/mL, with the concentration of 32 μg/mL fungicidal for 3 (50%) of the strains tested. In this way, the MFC50 was established as 32 μg/mL.
