 <sub>2</sub>-adrenergic and tissue adrenergic receptors, K
 <sub>ATP </sub>channels, nitric oxide were investigated to uncover antimotility mechanisms of action and castor oil-induced enteropooling to elucidate antisecretory mechanisms. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated in the minimum inhibitory concentration model, the fractional inhibitory concentration index using the (-)-fenchone association method with standard antimicrobial agents.
