<p>(-)-Fenchone at doses (75, 150 and 300 mg/kg) has antidiarrheal activity, with a significant decrease in the evacuation index. This activity is possibly related to a percentage of reduced intestinal transit (75, 150 and 300 mg/kg). The antimotility effect of (-)-fenchone decreased in the presence of pilocarpine, yohimbine, propranolol, L-NG-nitroarginine methyl ester or glibenclamide. In the enteropooling model, no reduction in intestinal fluid weight was observed. (-)-Fenchone did not show antibacterial activity, inhibits the growth of strains of fungi with a minimum fungicidal concentration of 32 Î¼g/mL. As for the association between (-)-fenchone and amphotericin B in strains of Candida albicans, it was observed that the association was indifferent.</p>
