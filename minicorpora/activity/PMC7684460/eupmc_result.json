    "<h4>Background</h4>(-)-Fenchone is a bicyclic monoterpene present in essential oils of plant species, such as <i>Foeniculum vulgare</i> and <i>Peumus boldus</i>, used to treatment of gastrointestinal diseases. Pharmacological studies report its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antinociceptive activity.<h4>Aim</h4>To investigate antidiarrheal activity related to gastrointestinal motility, intestinal secretion and antimicrobial activity.<h4>Methods</h4>A castor oil-induced diarrhea model was used to evaluate antidiarrheal activity. Intestinal transit and gastric emptying protocols were used to assess a possible antimotility effect. Muscarinic receptors, presynaptic α<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic and tissue adrenergic receptors, K<sub>ATP</sub> channels, nitric oxide were investigated to uncover antimotility mechanisms of action and castor oil-induced enteropooling to elucidate antisecretory mechanisms. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated in the minimum inhibitory concentration model, the fractional inhibitory concentration index using the (-)-fenchone association method with standard antifungal agents.<h4>Results</h4>(-)-Fenchone (75, 150 and 300 mg/kg) showed antidiarrheal activity, with a significant decrease in the evacuation index. This activity is possibly related to a percentage of reduced intestinal transit (75, 150 and 300 mg/kg). The antimotility effect of (-)-fenchone decreased in the presence of pilocarpine, yohimbine, propranolol, L-NG-nitroarginine methyl ester or glibenclamide. In the enteropooling model, no reduction in intestinal fluid weight was observed. (-)- Fenchone did not show antibacterial activity; on the other hand, inhibits the growth of strains of fungi with a minimum fungicide concentration of 32 μg/mL. However, when it was associated with amphotericin B, no synergism was observed.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The antidiarrheal effect of (-)-fenchone in this study involves antimotility effect and not involve antisecretory mechanisms. (-)-Fenchone presents antifungal activity; however, it did not show antibacterial activity."
