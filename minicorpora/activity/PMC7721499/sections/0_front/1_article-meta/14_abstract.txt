0: Water steam distillation is a classical method of rose oil production from the flowers of   Rosa damascena Mill.
1: This process produces considerable amount of waste water.
2: In this study, ion-exchange column chromatography (Amberlite was the stationary phase) was used to prepare polyphenol-enriched fraction of waste water with improved biological activity.
3: Phenol, flavonoid, and anthocyanin contents were examined before and after using column.
4: Antioxidant activities, DNA protection ability, xanthine oxidase inhibition, and cytotoxicity of this fraction were also determined.
5: The use of Amberlite increased phenol, flavonoid, and anthocyanin contents in fraction compared to the sample before fractionation.
6: The IC  50 values of various antioxidant assays comprises 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl-hydrate (DPPH), ferric-reducing antioxidant power assay (FRAP), and 2,2-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) which were 226.66  1.25, 126.03  0.11, and 241.43  0.33 for waste water, and these values for fraction were 63.21  0.90, 34.6  0.17, and 50.59  0.75   g/ml, respectively.
7: The Trolox equivalent values of fraction in oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay were 0.34  0.04, and the EC  50 values in cellular antioxidant activity were 91.24  0.32   g/ml.
8: The xanthine oxidase inhibition capacity of fraction (100   g/ml) was 96.4  0.02%   g/ml.
9: The comet assay analysis showed that this fraction (25100   g/ml) protects human lymphocytes against H  2O  2-induced DNA damages significantly.
10: The IC  50 values of cytotoxicity assay were 248.145  35.56 and 227.14  16.51   g/ml after 24 and 48 h, respectively.
11: There has been great attention to the valorization of waste materials.
12: Recovered fraction could be considered as a proper antioxidant, DNA damage-protection agent, and xanthine oxidase inhibitor.
13: Using a nontoxic solid phase such as Amberlite is a fruitful way to concentrate bioactive ingredients which can be used in pharmaceutical and nutraceutical industry.
