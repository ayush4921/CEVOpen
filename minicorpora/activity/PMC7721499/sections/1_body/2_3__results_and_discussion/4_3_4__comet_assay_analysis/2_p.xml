<p>In this assay, cells were exposed to H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> as a source of ROS and sample as an antioxidant simultaneously, for tiny time. Generally, more antioxidant activity leads to more reduction in DNA breaks [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. For the fraction, a range of concentrations (25–100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) did not show any genotoxicity and could be considered as a nongenotoxic concentration (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The cells exposed to H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> solely showed significant DNA strand breaks, while lymphocyte treated with 25, 50 and 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml fraction and H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> simultaneously showed a significant reduction of DNA damage level (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). These results are in favor of antioxidant activity as well as a high amount of phenol, flavonoid, and anthocyanin of this fraction.
