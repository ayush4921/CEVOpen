0: Development of bactericides and fungicides in terms of isolation and identification of substances is an important area of research.
1: Presently, under the concept of integrated pest management, all possible plant pest and disease control methods are integrated to minimize the excessive use of synthetic chemicals and also the incidence of disease.The potential of various essential oils against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and fungi is being actively investigated in various laboratories across the world.
2: Rice the most important crop, suffers from huge yield losses due to blast and blight diseases.
3: Most of the labs have focussed to use transgenic approaches, the use of environmentally friendly natural products, as disease control strategies.
4: In this context, we propose to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of essential oils and their ability to control diseases of rice.
5: Seven Essential oils from seven different plants were selected for the study.
6: The antimicrobial activity was assessed in terms of their antibacterial activity towards non-pathogenic bacteria and pathogenic drug resistant bacteria by means of their ability to sensitize the drug resistant bacteria in plasmid curing and, -lactamase inhibition and as antifungal agents.
7: In conclusion, out of the seven essential oils used, lemongrass, palm rosa and eucalyptus were found to be good antimicrobial agents.
