0: The Lamiaceae family is an important source of species among medicinal plants highly valued for their biological properties and numerous uses in folk medicine.
1: Origanum is one of the main genera that belong to this family.
2: The purpose of the study was to determine the phenolic composition of the   Origanum vulgare extract and evaluate the antimicrobial, antioxidant, and inhibitory activities of this species that grows in the Andean region of the Atacama Desert.
3: High-performance liquid chromatography was performed to determine the main phenols.
4: Rosmarinic acid was identified as the predominant phenolic compound in this species (76.01 mg/100 g DW), followed by protocatechuic acid, which to our knowledge, no previous study reported similar concentrations in   O. vulgare.
5: The oregano extract exhibited a content of total phenolic (3948 mg GAE/100 g DW) and total flavonoid (593 mg QE/100 g DW) with a higher DPPH antioxidant activity (IC  50 = 40.58 g/mL), compared to the same species grown under other conditions.
6: Furthermore, it was found to inhibit -glucosidase activity with an IC  50 value (7.11 mg/mL) lower than acarbose (129.32 mg/mL).
7: Pseudomonas syringae and   Pantoea agglomerans (both MIC 0.313 mg/mL and MBC 1.25 mg/mL) were the bacteria most susceptible to oregano extract with the lowest concentration necessary to inhibit bacterial growth.
8: These results open the door for the potential use of this plant to manage chronic diseases, and they expand the knowledge of the species cultivated in arid environmental conditions.
