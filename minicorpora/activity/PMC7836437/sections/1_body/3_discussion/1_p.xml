<p>The major discovery of this investigation was that EOHc had an antiedematogenic effect in experimental models of acute edema. This EOHc effect was obtained with a great pharmacological efficacy and a conspicuously long duration. Since this is an accepted model of anti-inflammatory activity, the data suggested that EOHc acted through an anti-inflammatory effect. This also showed, for the first time, that the effect of EOHc was very potent to prevent the formation of edema, but also has great efficacy in reversing the already installed edema.</p>
