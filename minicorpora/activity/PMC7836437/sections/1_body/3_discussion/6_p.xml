<p>EOHc was more potent in inhibiting the carrageenan-induced edema than that induced by dextran. Oral pretreatment with 30, 100, or 300 mg/kg EOHc inhibited 60, 75, and 80% of carrageenan-induced and 40, 50, and 60% of the dextran-induced peak of edema, respectively. Dextran, a polysaccharide of high molecular weight, induces osmotic and acellular edema, mainly mediated by histamine and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine), consequent to the degranulation of mast cells residing in the endothelium of the microvessels (

On the other hand, carrageenan, a sulfated polysaccharide extracted from algae, induces an inflammatory response with different phases, with infiltrate containing large numbers of neutrophils and proteins (

In the second phase (61-120 min), release of kinins predominantly occurs, such as bradykinin, and in the third phase (121-180 min) the release of mainly prostaglandin occurs (
