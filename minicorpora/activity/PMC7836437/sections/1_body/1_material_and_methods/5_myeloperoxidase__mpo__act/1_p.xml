<p>For MPO activity, paw edema was induced by intra-plantar injection in the right hind paw of 50 μL of inflammatory stimuli, carrageenan at 1%, 60 min after intra-gastric administration of EOHc (100 mg/kg) or vehicle (Tween 80, 0.05% v/v). The contralateral paw (control) received an equal volume of 0.9% NaCl. At the inflammatory peak, 180 min after edema induction, the animals were sacrificed, sub-plantar tissue was removed, and immediately processed for analysis of MPO activity according to the method described by Rao et al. (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). The MPO assay reaction mixture consisted of the supernatant, 0.5% hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), 0.68 mg/mL o-dianisidine dihydrochloride, and 0.003% hydrogen peroxide. The absorbance of this mixture was measured at 450 nm. One unit of MPO activity was defined as the quantity of enzyme degrading 1.0 μmol of hydrogen peroxide per min at 25°C, reported as MPO × 10
 <sup>3</sup> U/mg tissue.
