<p>In relation to edema induced by serotonin (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f04">Figure 4B and E</xref>), the inhibitory effect of EOHc (100 and 300 mg/kg) also started in the first 15 min after serotonin administration and was maintained throughout the observation period (120 min). At the edema peak (15 min after serotonin administration), paw volume inhibition corresponded to 22.95±5.17 and 37.25±5.57% (for EOHc 100 and 300 mg/kg, respectively) of the paw volume increase by serotonin (181.7±7.05 µL). The positive control (cyproheptadine) inhibited 74.95±3.16% of peak control edema (
