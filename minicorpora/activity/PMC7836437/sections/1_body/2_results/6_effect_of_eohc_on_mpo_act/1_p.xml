<p>As expected, at the inflammatory peak, 180 min after edema induction, the paw edema induced by carrageenan was associated with a significant increase in MPO activity, a marker of neutrophilic infiltration, from 3.21×10

In the group with edema induced by carrageenan pre-treated with EOHc (100 mg/kg) by the oral route, the carrageenan-induced increase of MPO activity was significantly decreased (P&lt;0.05) to about 40% of carrageenan control-induced MPO activity. Although undergoing a significant decline, MPO activity did not return to control levels, observed before carrageenan administration (P&lt;0.05,
