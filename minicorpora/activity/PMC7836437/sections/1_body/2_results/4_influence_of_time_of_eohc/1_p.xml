<p>For this experimental series, the dose of 100 mg/kg of EOHc was used, because this was the lowest dose that had a similar effect to indomethacin, the positive control. In this way, any possible adverse effect would be minimized. The observation period was extended to 48 h after edema induction. Administered at different times relative to the time of administration of the edema inducing agent, the best EOHc effect occurred when EOHc was administered 60 min prior to the carrageenan (
