0: Hyptis crenata, commonly known as salva-do-Marajo, hortela-do-campo, and hortelazinha, is used in folk medicine in Northeast Brazil as tea or infusion to treat inflammatory diseases.
1: Due to the pharmacological efficacy and the low toxicity of the essential oil of   Hyptis crenata (EOHc), we decided to investigate the EOHc antiedematogenic effect in experimental models of inflammation.
2: EOHc was administrated orally at doses of 10-300 mg/kg to male Swiss albino mice.
3: Paw edema was induced by subcutaneous injection in the right hind paw of inflammatory stimuli (carrageenan, dextran, histamine, serotonin, and bradykinin) 60 min after administration of EOHc.
4: EOHc significantly inhibited the induced edema.
5: The inhibitory effect of EOHc on dextran-induced edema extended throughout the experimental time.
6: For the 30, 100, and 300 mg/kg doses of EOHc, the inhibition was of 40.281.70, 51.182.69, and 59.242.13%, respectively.
7: The EOHc inhibitory effect on carrageenan-induced edema started at 10 mg/kg at the second hour (h) and was maintained throughout the observation period.
8: At 30, 100, and 300 mg/kg doses the inhibition started earlier, from 30 min.
9: At the edema peak of 180 min, 56, 76, and 82% inhibition was observed for 30, 100, and 300 mg/kg doses, respectively.
10: Additionally, the effect of EOHc on carrageenan-induced paw edema was influenced by the time of administration.
11: The EOHc also inhibited myeloperoxidase activity.
12: In conclusion, the EOHc showed a potent effect, both preventing and reversing the edema, consistent with its anti-inflammatory use in folk medicine.
