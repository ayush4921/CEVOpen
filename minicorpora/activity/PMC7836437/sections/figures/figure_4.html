 <caption> Effect of essential oil of Hyptis crenata (EOHc,100 and 300 mg/kg, orally) on paw edema induced by histamine, serotonin, or bradykinin. A and D, Effect of EOHc and of cyproheptadine (Cyp, 5 mg/kg) on the time course (15-120 min) of edema induced by intraplantar injection of histamine (HA, 50 ηmol/paw) or Vehicle (Vh, 0.9% NaCl solution, 50 μL/paw). B and E, Effect of EOHc and of Cyp (5 mg/kg) on the time course (15-120 min) of edema induced by intraplantar injection of serotonin (5HT, 1 μg/paw) or Vehicle (Vh, 0.9% NaCl solution, 50 μL/paw). C and F, Effect of EOHc on the time course (10-60 min) of edema induced by intraplantar injection of bradykinin (BK, 3 ηmol/paw) or Vehicle (Vh, 0.9% NaCl solution, 50 μL/paw). Data are reported as means±SE (n=10). *P&lt;0.05 vs control, #P&lt;0.05 vs treated animals (EOHc, 100 and 300 mg/kg) (two-way ANOVA and one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's test). </caption>
