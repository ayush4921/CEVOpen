 <caption> Effect of essential oil of Hyptys crenata (EOHc) on paw edema induced by carrageenan. A and B, Effect of several doses of EOHc (10-300 mg/kg, orally) and of indomethacin (Id, 10 mg/kg) on the time course (30-300 min) of edema induced by intraplantar injection of carrageenan (Cg, 300 µg/paw) or of its vehicle (Vh, 0.9% NaCl solution, 50 μL/paw). C and D, Influence of time of administration on the anti-inflammatory effect of EOHc (100 mg/kg) on the time course (30 min up to 48 h) of carrageenan-induced edema. The negative numbers (-1 and -0.5 h) indicate administration of EOHc before edema induction, the positive number (+0.5 h) indicates administration of EOHc after edema induction and 0 h indicates administration of EOHc concomitant with edema induction. *P&lt;0.05, **P&lt;0.01 vs control (two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's test). </caption>
