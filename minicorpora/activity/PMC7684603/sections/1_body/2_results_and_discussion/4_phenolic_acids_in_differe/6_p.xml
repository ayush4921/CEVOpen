<p>Cinnamic acid was recorded as the predominant compounds of phenolic acid in all growth stages. However, its maximum value (225.3 mg/g extract) was in the early stages of flowering, and its lowest value (8.0 mg/g extract) was in the mid‐mature stage. Cinnamic acid is a natural aromatic phenolic acid whose long‐term consumption is associated with low toxicity to humans and is used in flavorings, artificial color, and some specific medications. The frequent use of cinnamic acid is as a precursor for the methyl cinnamate, ethyl cinnamate, and benzyl cinnamate production which have perfume industrial use. It is also a precursor for the artificial sweetener aspartame. Cinnamic acid is one of the phenolic acids with several biological and medicinal properties, as well as other economical and industrial values (Bradley et al.,

 <italic>H. persicum</italic> is considered as one of the plants with a rich source of cinnamic acid, especially in the floral budding stage and early development of seeds stage; however, as the plant entered the mature seed stage, we observed the significant reduction in its value.
