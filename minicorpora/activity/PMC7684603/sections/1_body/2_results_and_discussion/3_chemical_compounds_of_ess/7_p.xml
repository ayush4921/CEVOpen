<p>Anethole was the predominant compounds in the floral budding stage and full flowering stage, and the highest value was obtained in the floral budding stage (14.6%); prior to flowering, its amount was not significant, and after that it greatly reduced. Apiol and 1‐tetradecanol were the other compounds that observed in the first three stages of plant vegetative stages. As shown in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn31916-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>, the maximum values of apiol (7.1%) and 1‐tetradecanol (7.7%) belongs to the full flowering stage and the vegetative stages, respectively. Caryophyllene oxide was the compounds that declined with the increase in plant age, and the highest value was obtained in the vegetative stage at the rate of 6.1%.
