<p>The essential oils were classified according to their chemical formula to eight groups (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31916-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Based on the results, the main percentage of the essential oil was aliphatic esters, which value was 3.4% in the vegetative stage and finally hit 83.7% in the immature seeds stage or in the mid‐mature seeds stage. Therefore, by increasing the age of the plant and seeds formation, the value of this group of compounds was increased (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31916-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The main components of aliphatic esters group were reported as hexyl butyrate, octyl acetate, octyl butyrate, and hexyl 2‐methylbutyrate, which their amounts were different in various phenological stages of growth. In the present study, these compounds were observed mostly in the last three phenological postflowering stages (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31916-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>); other researchers also found more aliphatic compounds in the generative organs, such as in seeds of
