<p>Recent reports suggest that biological features of the 
 <italic>H. persicum</italic> such as anti‐inflammatory, anti‐pain, antioxidant, and anti‐seizure can be attributed to basic essential oil compounds (Majidi &amp; Sadati Lamardi, 
 <xref rid="fsn31916-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). The analysis of our data at various phenological stages of 
 <italic>H. persicum</italic> indicated significant variations in the type and percentage of essential oil constituents (Table 
 <xref rid="fsn31916-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In total, in the vegetative stages, floral budding stage, full flowering stage, early development of seeds stage, mid‐mature seeds stage, and final stage or late‐mature/ripe seeds stage, values of 96.8%, 97.4%, 96.8%, 98.1%, 97.1%, and 98.5% of the total essential oil constituent were, respectively, identified.
