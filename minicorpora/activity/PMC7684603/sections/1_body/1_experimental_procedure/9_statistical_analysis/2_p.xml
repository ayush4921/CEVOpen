<p>In order to determine the relationship between different phytochemical compounds, variance analysis, comparison of means, principal component analysis (PCA), and cluster analysis were done using the statistical package SAS 9.4. All determinations were conducted in triplicate, and the results were calculated as mean value ± standard error (SE). The variations (standard error of means, SE) and the significances of treatment effects (
 <italic>F</italic>‐test) were calculated and tested using the General Linear Models procedure of SAS. The mean values of treatments were separated by 
 <italic>Tukey's</italic> test (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05).
