0: AbstractHeracleum persicum, commonly named Persian hogweed, is a principal native medicinal plant in Iran.
1: Collecting   H. persicum at the most appropriate growing stage is the key factor to achieve the high phytochemical quality to meet consumer's needs.
2: In the present experiment, the aerial parts of this plant were harvested at up to six different developmental stages during the growing season to determine the phytochemical profiles.
3: Our results indicated that the highest essential oil content was obtained in the midmature seed stage (3.5%).
4: The most elevated extract content was recorded in the floral budding stage (10.4%).
5: In the vegetative stage, limonene (18.1%), in floral budding stage, caryophyllene (14.1%), anethole (14.6%), and bisabolene (12.7%), in the full flowering stage, myristicin (15.0%), and hexyl butyrate (9.1%), in the early development of seeds stage, hexyl butyrate (32.1%), and octyl acetate (11.7%), in the midmature seeds stage hexyl butyrate (38.8%), octyl acetate (14.5%), in the latemature/ripe seeds stage, hexyl butyrate (23.6%), and octyl acetate (10.5%) are recorded as the main components.
6: The highest phenolic acids content was obtained in the floral budding stage (287.40 mg/g dried extract).
7: The analysis of phenolic acids demonstrated cinnamic acid (8.0225.3 mg/g extract), pcoumaric acid (1.739.2 mg/g extract), phydroxybenzoic acid (0.816.8 mg/g extract), and ferulic acid (2.415.8 mg/g extract) as the main phenolic acids.
8: Cinnamic acid was found as the major phenolic compound in the vegetative stage following by floral budding, the full flowering stage, the early development of seeds, and latemature/ripe seeds stages.
9: Pcoumaric acid was the most abundant phenolic compounds in the midmature seeds stage.
10: In this regard, the harvest time of   H. persicum aerial parts can be selected to achieve the highest secondary metabolites of interest.
11: The results of this study can be used as a guideline for grower to obtain the highest possible amount of desirable metabolites, beneficial in both food and pharmaceutical industries as well as their undeniable economical benefits.
