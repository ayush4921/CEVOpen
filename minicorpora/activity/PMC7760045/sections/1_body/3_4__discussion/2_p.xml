<p>Earlier studies suggest that a single treatment is usually not sufficient to ensure microbiological safety of fresh products [

Based on the FICI value, it was found that the mixtures of SOO + SMO and SOO + CO in a ¼ MIC + ¼ MIC combination had synergistic antilisterial effects, which has not been reported before. In turn, the mixture of SMO + CO in a ¼ MIC + ¼ MIC combination did not inhibit the growth of 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>. The additive effect of this mixture was observed in a ¼ MIC + ½ MIC combination and was probably the result of summing the essential oils constituents with similar chemical structures. Mixtures of EOs in the other combinations had an additive or indifferent antilisterial effect. Similarly, a mixture of essential oils from 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> L. and 
 <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> L. and mixtures of 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> with 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> (thyme) essential oils had a synergistic or additive effect on 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> and other foodborne pathogens [

In earlier studies, a combined antilisterial effect between nisin and EOs was observed, and the addition of a third factor in the form of diglycerol monolaurate led to further combined antilisterial activities between the essential oil constituents and nisin even at lower, sub-lethal concentrations [
