<p>This research attempted antilisterial protection of vegetables minimally processed by two-component mixtures of essential oils in sub-inhibitory concentrations with simultaneous good sensory evaluation of the product. The results indicate that SOO, SMO and CO had inhibitory effects on 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> growth, but at different MIC values (SOO &lt; CO &lt; SMO). The antibacterial activity of EOs depends on the phenolic components in which EOs are rich [

Cell death under the influence of carvacrol is the result of a rupture of the cytoplasmic membrane, which consequently leads to leakage of intracellular content [

Spanish marjoram oil is rich in 1,8-cineole (69.15%), while in coriander oil, there is the most linalool (68.45%). Previous studies have shown lower antilisterial activity of 1,8-cineole, linalool and Î±-pinene than carvacrol and thymol [
