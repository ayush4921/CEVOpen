 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> cells with the same effect as EOs alone at 1 MIC. At the same time intervals, a significantly greater (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) reduction in 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> was caused by the mixture of SOO + CO than by SOO + SMO. This phenomenon can be explained by a greater synergy of ingredients in SOO + CO compared to SOO + SMO. It is difficult to explain the synergy of the main components of EOs, because the antimicrobial activity of EOs consists of all components, even those found in very small amounts. In addition, the effectiveness of antibacterial activity can be enhanced by EO components with lipophilic properties, functional group strength and water solubility [
