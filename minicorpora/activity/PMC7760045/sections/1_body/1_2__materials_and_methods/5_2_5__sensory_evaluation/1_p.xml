<p>A commercial ready-to-eat mixture of vegetables (described above) was used. The vegetables were soaked in solutions of EOs prepared in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.0). The solutions contained EOs alone at MIC, i.e., 0.1% SOO, 0.4% CO, 0.9% SMO, or mixtures of SOO + CO and SOO + SMO at ¼ MIC + ¼ MIC, previously diluted in 10% DMSO. The vegetables were incubated in solutions for 1 min, after which they were dried and stored in sterile plastic containers at 8 ± 1 °C and 55%–60% relative humidity in a cooling incubator (CHL5, Pol-Eko-Aparatura, Wodzisław, Poland) for 4 days. All samples were evaluated after 30 min and after 4 days of refrigerated storage. The sensory evaluation of vegetables was performed by a team of 50 partially trained panelists, consisting of employees and students of the Institute of Food Sciences, WULS-SGGW in Warsaw, using a nine-point hedonic scale in accordance with the methodology described by Baryłko-Pikielna and Matuszewska [
 <xref rid="B23-foods-09-01740" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Samples of 10 g were coded with random numbers and given in randomized duplicates. The panelists used a list of qualitative descriptors established at a special session, i.e., color, texture, odor, taste and overall quality, which is a summary of the features included in the assessment. The intensity of each descriptor was assessed on a continuous graphic scale, with edge markings, where 1 represents extremely dislike and 9 represents extremely like. Average values were calculated and the results were presented in the form of a chart.
