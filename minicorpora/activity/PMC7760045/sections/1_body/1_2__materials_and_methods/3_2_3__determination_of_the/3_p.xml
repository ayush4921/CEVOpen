<p>Antilisterial activity of EO mixtures was expressed as the fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI), equal to the sum of fractional inhibitory concentrations (FICs) for each EO, which was calculated according to the following formula [
 <xref rid="B21-foods-09-01740" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]:
 <disp-formula>FICI = FIC
  <sub>EO1</sub> + FIC
  <sub>EO2</sub> = (MIC
  <sub>EO1</sub> in combination/MIC
  <sub>EO1</sub> alone) + (MIC
  <sub>EO2</sub> in combination/MIC
  <sub>EO2</sub> alone)
