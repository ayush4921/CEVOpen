<p>In total, 200 g of vegetable mixture in equal proportions of endive chicory, lettuce and red beet was washed under running water and blended with 800 mL of distilled water and filtered through gauze. Then, the vegetable filtrate was sterilized at 117 °C for 15 min. Its pH was 6.27. Five 20 mL portions of vegetable filtrate were prepared with EOs in MIC and with two mixtures of SOO + CO and SOO + SMO at ¼ MIC + ¼ MIC combination. The control sample was 20 mL of vegetable filtrate without EOs. To the samples with/without EOs, 1 mL of 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> inoculum (prepared as above) was added and the samples were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The cell numbers of 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> were determined at 0, 4, 6, 12 and 24 h in TSA. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The result was reported in CFU × mL
 <sup>−1</sup>. Three independent series of experiments in triplicate were performed.
