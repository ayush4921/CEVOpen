<p>A 600 g commercial ready-to-eat mixture of fresh cut vegetables (endive chicory, lettuce and red beet in equal proportions) was first washed under running water, then washed in distilled water and immersed in a solution of 0.05% sodium hypochlorite for 15 min to reduce natural microflora. Then, the vegetables were immersed in the inoculum of 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> (prepared as above) at room temperature (22 °C) for 15 min. They were air-dried at 22 °C for 1 h in the biosafety cabinet for better cell adhesion, with plant tissue and excess fluid removed. The vegetables were aseptically divided into six portions of 50 g, in duplicate, which for 1 min were immersed in solutions containing SOO, CO or SMO at MIC (0.1%, 0.4% and 0.9%, respectively) prepared in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.0) or mixtures of SOO + CO and SOO + SMO in a combination at ¼ MIC + ¼ MIC, previously diluted in 10% DMSO. The control sample consisted of inoculated vegetables dipped in sterile distilled water. Thirty minutes after sample preparation, the number of 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> was determined. For this purpose, 25 g samples were transferred to 225 mL of BPW and homogenized in a stomacher (Lab-Blender 400, Seward Medical, London, UK) for 1 min. All samples were diluted ten-fold and transferred in duplicate into PA. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Three independent series of experiments in triplicate were performed.
