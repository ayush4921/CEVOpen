<p>Studies have shown that mixtures of EOs in sub-inhibitory concentrations inactivate 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> in vegetable filtrate and in minimally processed vegetables. Optimal combinations of essential oils based on SOO + SMO in low concentrations assist in achieving antilisterial activity in final products. Furthermore, such combinations of EOs do not affect the deterioration of odor and taste and maintain acceptable levels of sensory value.
