<p>The effect of mixtures of two EOs in different combinations and concentrations on inhibition of 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> growth is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-09-01740-f002">Figure 2</xref>. Five SOO + SMO mixtures showed bacteriostatic activity against 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>. These were mixtures of SOO at ½ MIC in combination with SMO at ½ MIC, ¼ MIC or ⅛ MIC and mixtures of SOO at ¼ MIC in combination with SMO at ½ MIC or ¼ MIC. Four mixtures of SOO + CO inhibited the growth of 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>, in which SOO at ½ MIC was in combination with CO at ½ MIC or ¼ MIC and SOO at ¼ MIC was in combination with CO at ½ MIC or ¼ MIC. On the other hand, only two mixtures of CO + SMO showed a bacteriostatic effect against 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>. These were mixtures containing CO + SMO in a ½ MIC + ½ MIC combination and in a ½ MIC + ¼ MIC combination.
