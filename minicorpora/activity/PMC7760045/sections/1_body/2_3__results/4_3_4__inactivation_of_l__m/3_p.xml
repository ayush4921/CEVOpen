<p>Treatment of the fresh cut vegetable mixture by EOs or their mixtures resulted in a decrease in the number of 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> approximately by three log cycles after 30 min (
 <xref rid="foods-09-01740-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). SOO at 0.1% (1 MIC) had very strong activity and reduced the number of 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> to the limit of detection. Statistically significant differences (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) were found between bacterial numbers in the CO-treated vegetable mixture at 1 MIC and SOO + CO, at a ¼ MIC + ¼ MIC combination, which indicates the stronger antilisterial effect of this mixture.
