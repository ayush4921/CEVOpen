<p>Adding to the vegetable filtrate EO mixtures at sub-inhibitory concentrations significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) reduced the number of 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> after 4 h. However, differences in the potency of the EO mixtures against bacteria were observed. At the same time, the SOO + CO mixture resulted in a greater reduction (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in the number of cells in the test strain than the SOO + SMO mixture at a ¼ MIC + ¼ MIC combination. In the sample with the SOO + CO mixture, the number of 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> decreased by 3.8 log cycles after 4 h and this tendency persisted in the remaining time interval. No significant differences (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05) were found between 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> numbers in the vegetable filtrate treated with the SOO + CO mixture and CO alone for up to 6 h. The SOO + SMO mixture had a weaker effect on 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>, which reduced the number of cells approximately by three log cycles after 4 h. After 24 h, the number of 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> in the vegetable filtrate containing EO mixtures was &lt;1 log CFU × mL
