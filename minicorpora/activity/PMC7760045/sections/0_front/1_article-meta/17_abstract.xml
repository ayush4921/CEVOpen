 <p>The aim of this study was to evaluate two-component mixtures of essential oils (EOs) in sub-inhibitory concentrations for antilisterial protection of minimally processed vegetables. Spanish origanum oil (SOO), Spanish marjoram oil (SMO) and coriander oil (CO) and a mixture of fresh leafy vegetables with red beet were used. The chemical compositions of selected EOs were analyzed by gas chromatography. Carvacrol was the major component of SOO. The dominant active component of SMO was 1,8-cineole, while the major constituent in CO was linalool. The study shows that essential oils in combination, namely SOO + SMO and SOO + CO in a ¼ MIC + ¼ MIC (Minimal Inhibitory Concentration), have a synergistic effect against 
  <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>. The reduction of 
  <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> in vegetable mixtures treated by EOs in these selected combinations after 24 h of storage was approximately equal to the limit of detection. Furthermore, it was found that the vegetable mixture treated with SOO + SMO had the highest-rated sensorial quality and could therefore meet consumer expectations.
