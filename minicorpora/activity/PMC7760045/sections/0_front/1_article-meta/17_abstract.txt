0: The aim of this study was to evaluate two-component mixtures of essential oils (EOs) in sub-inhibitory concentrations for antilisterial protection of minimally processed vegetables.
1: Spanish origanum oil (SOO), Spanish marjoram oil (SMO) and coriander oil (CO) and a mixture of fresh leafy vegetables with red beet were used.
2: The chemical compositions of selected EOs were analyzed by gas chromatography.
3: Carvacrol was the major component of SOO.
4: The dominant active component of SMO was 1,8-cineole, while the major constituent in CO was linalool.
5: The study shows that essential oils in combination, namely SOO + SMO and SOO + CO in a 14 MIC + 14 MIC (Minimal Inhibitory Concentration), have a synergistic effect against   L. monocytogenes.
6: The reduction of   L. monocytogenes in vegetable mixtures treated by EOs in these selected combinations after 24 h of storage was approximately equal to the limit of detection.
7: Furthermore, it was found that the vegetable mixture treated with SOO + SMO had the highest-rated sensorial quality and could therefore meet consumer expectations.
