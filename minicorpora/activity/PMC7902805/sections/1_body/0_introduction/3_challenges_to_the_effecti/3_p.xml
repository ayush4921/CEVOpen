<p id="p0040">Even though the single metronidazole therapy has a failure rate of only 10%, these figures are significant due to the large number of patients suffering from trichomoniasis. Although oral 5-nitroimidazoles such as metronidazole and tinidazole exhibit high cure rates, trichomonas infection can still be highly persistent and recurrent (

 <xref rid="bib81" ref-type="bibr">Se√±a et al., 2014</xref>). One of the major reasons for this is the drug resistance to metronidazole or cross-resistance to other 5-nitroimidazoles or, in some cases, multiple drug resistance (

 <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Mehriardestani et al., 2017</xref>). Drug resistance to metronidazole or the whole 5-nitroimidazole family is fairly common, which eventually exposes the lack of drugs available in the armamentarium to treat trichomonas infection. Given the population density that suffers from trichomonas infection and lack of drugs, there is an urgent need to discover safe and efficacious drugs to treat trichomonosis.
