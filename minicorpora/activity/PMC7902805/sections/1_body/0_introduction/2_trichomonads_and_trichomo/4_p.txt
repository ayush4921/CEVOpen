0: The only species with well-established pathogenic potential in humans is  T. vaginalis.
1: Trichomoniasis is the most common non-viral sexually transmitted urogenital infection that affects both men and women.
2: Caused by flagellated protozoan parasite  Trichomonas vaginalis, it mainly affects women's vagina, showing clinical symptoms like vaginal discharge, often yellow or green, vulvovaginal irritation, and dysuria.
3: Men with trichomoniasis may not show any clinical signs; however, the urethra is the most common infection site, causing urethral irritation, discharge, or mild burning after urination or ejaculation and swelling of the prostate gland ( Rein, 2020).
4: Humans are the only host for the  T. vaginalis parasite existing only in trophozoite form that uses adhesion proteins to bind to squamous epithelial cells.
5: Soluble and membrane-associated enzymes having phospholipase A activity cause lysis of nucleated cells, resulting in microulcerations and microscopic hemorrhages of the vaginal wall and exocervix.
6: Although humoral and cell-mediated immune-inflammatory responses are generated, repeated, and persistent infection occurs, indicating non-protective immunity ( Meites and Workowski, 2018).
