<p id="p0030">Treatment of trichomoniasis, for the last several decades, involves 5′-nitroimidazoles, e.g., metronidazole, tinidazole, ornidazole, and nimorazole. Metronidazole low-dose vaginal preparations are not effective for trichomoniasis; hence high-dose vaginal suppositories are used. The male partner(s) should also be treated simultaneously, even if asymptomatic. Metronidazole or tinidazole 2 g orally as a single dose of metronidazole 500 mg orally twice daily for seven days is the treatment option. Based on the observations of a multicentre, open-label, randomized controlled trial in women positive for 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> infection, 7-days low dose metronidazole is recommended as a primary treatment (

 <italic>T. tenax</italic> is morphologically close to 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> and is sensitive to anti-parasitic treatment with tinidazole (
