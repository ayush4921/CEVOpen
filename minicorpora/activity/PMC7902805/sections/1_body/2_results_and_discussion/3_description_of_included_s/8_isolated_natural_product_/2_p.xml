<p id="p0185">Candimine, an alkaloid from the bulbs of 
 <italic>Hippeastrum morelianum</italic>, was found to be cytotoxic for the parasite 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> (
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Giordani et al., 2010a</xref>). An ultrastructural study of the parasite in the presence of candimine revealed striking morphological alterations, although the cell membrane remained intact in all parasites observed. After treatment with 1 for 6 and 24Â h, modifications in size, shape, and intracellular localization of hydrogenosomes. The hydrogenosomes presented signs of autophagy. Besides, candimine caused arrest of the 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> cell cycle, altered morphologic and ultrastructural features, but did not induce the formation of apoptotic bodies, left the cell membrane intact, and did not cause exposure of phosphatidylserine residues nor DNA fragmentation. Thus, candimine-induced cell death in 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> fails to fulfill apoptosis criteria and instead exhibits features like paraptosis.
