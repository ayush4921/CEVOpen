<p id="p0245">Essential oils are the natural, volatile, aromatic, complex secondary metabolites produced in aromatic plants and are characterized by strong aroma (
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Bakkali et al., 2008</xref>). Such aromatic plants generally grow in warm and tropical countries. Essential oils are known to possess medicinal properties, e.g., virucidal, fungicidal, antiseptic, and bactericidal. Some of the essential oils like those from 
 <italic>Mentha piperita</italic> (peppermint), 
 <italic>Salvia officinalis</italic> (
 <xref rid="bib94" ref-type="bibr">Yousefi et al., 2013</xref>) 
 <italic>Zataria multiflora</italic> (
 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Mahboubi, 2018</xref>), and 
 <italic>Lavandula angustifolia</italic> (lavender) (
 <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Moon et al., 2006</xref>) possess anti-trichomonal properties. All four belong to the aromatic plants of the Lamiaceae or Labiatae family. Hydro-alcoholic extracts of 
 <italic>M. piperita</italic> and 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> were found to have anti-trichomonal activity comparable to metronidazole. However, 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> was found to have higher potency than 
 <italic>M. piperita</italic> (
 <xref rid="bib94" ref-type="bibr">Yousefi et al., 2013</xref>). From the same family, 
 <italic>Mentha crispa</italic> has been evaluated for its efficacy as anti-trichomonal activity in a clinical trial (
 <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Moraes et al., 2012</xref>). In a randomized, double-blind, and controlled clinical trial, 60 female patients were administered orally with 90% of the patients administered with 
 <italic>M. crispa</italic> was found to have recovered from trichomoniasis while 96.6% recovered using secnidazole [statistically not significantly different (p = 0.6120)]. However, the secnidazole group's adverse events were statistically significantly higher than the 
 <italic>M. crispa</italic> group (p = 0.0006). 
 <italic>Mentha crispa</italic> exhibited comparable therapeutic efficacy as that of secnidazole with significantly lower side effects (
 <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Moraes et al., 2012</xref>). In another 
 <italic>in-vitro</italic> study, the efficiency of 
 <italic>Mentha longifolia</italic> extract was compared with that of aqueous extract of 
 <italic>Pimpinella anisum</italic> against a clinical strain of 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> (
 <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">Niyyati et al., 2015</xref>). Aqueous extract of 
 <italic>Mentha longifolia</italic> reduced the number of live 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> in a time- and concentration-dependent manner and exhibited a MIC of 250 μg/mL and 200 μg/mL at the end of 24 h and 48 h, respectively. In contrast, an extract of 
 <italic>Pimpinella anisum</italic> inhibited only 73.7% and 86.9% of live parasites at a 500 μg/mL concentration at the end of 24 h and 48 h, respectively. 
 <italic>Mentha longifolia</italic> extract seems to possess higher potency towards 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> than 
 <italic>Pimpinella anisum</italic> (
 <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">Niyyati et al., 2015</xref>). Further, 
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Aslani et al. (2019)</xref> evaluated a vaginal cream for anti-trichomonal activity containing a combination of 
 <italic>Eucalyptus camaldulensis</italic>, 
 <italic>Viola odorata,</italic> and 
 <italic>Mentha piperita</italic> extracts. A cream preparation containing 2.5 mg/mL of 
 <italic>E. camaldulensis</italic>, 0.06 mg/mL of 
 <italic>V. odorata</italic>, and 1 mg/mL of 
 <italic>M. piperita</italic> was found to inhibit 100% growth of 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> at the end of 24 h. 
 <italic>Z. multiflora</italic> is another flowering plant of the Lamiaceae family that has been reported to possess anti-trichomonal properties. 
 <italic>Z. multiflora</italic> contains oxygenated sesquiterpenes (1.6–5.7%), monoterpene hydrocarbons (3.6–24.5%), thymol, carvacrol and linalool, and 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (
 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Mahboubi, 2018</xref>). 
 <italic>Z. multiflora</italic> essential oil at a concentration of 0.1–0.0004% was found to inhibit clinical isolates of 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> at 1 h (
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Abdollahy et al., 2004</xref>). Efficiency of 
 <italic>Z. multiflora</italic> vaginal cream, 0.1%, as compared with metronidazole in 54 non-pregnant women. 88.9% of patients were treated in the metronidazole group than 51.9% of the 
 <italic>Z. multiflora</italic> group. A group of 48.1% of patients treated with metronidazole showed adverse effects compared to none of the patients treated with 
 <italic>Z. multiflora</italic>. The authors concluded that though the clinical success was low in 
 <italic>Z. multiflora-</italic>treated patients, still the patients of this group exhibited greater improvement in clinical symptoms (
