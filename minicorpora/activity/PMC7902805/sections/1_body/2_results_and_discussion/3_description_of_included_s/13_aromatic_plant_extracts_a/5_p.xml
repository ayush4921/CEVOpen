<p id="p0260">Rosemary, an age-old globally used herb known to strengthen brain and memory activity, was found to possess antitrichomonal activity when the extract, rather than an essential oil, was used (
 <xref rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr">Saeidi et al., 2019</xref>). Rosemary essential oil essentially contains camphor, 1,8-cineole, verbenone, borneol, and α-pinene. In the same line, essential oil from 
 <italic>Artemisia sieberi</italic> was effective both 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> in an infected pigeon model against 
 <italic>Trichomonas gallinae</italic> (
 <xref rid="bib95" ref-type="bibr">Youssefi et al., 2017</xref>). 
 <italic>Pistacia lentiscus mastic</italic> and 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> oil are known for their anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-viral, and anti-protozoal effects were compared for anti-trichomonal activity (
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Ezz Eldin and Badawy, 2015</xref>). Amongst the two, 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> oil was found to be more potent as compared to 
 <italic>Pistacia lentiscus mastic</italic> oil. The minimum lethal dose of the 
 <italic>Pistacia lentiscus mastic</italic> oil was found to be 15 mg/mL after 24 h incubation, 10 mg/mL after 48 h, and 5 mg/mL after 96 h, while the minimal lethal concentration of 
 <italic>O. basilicum oil</italic> was 30 μg/mL after 24 h incubation, 20 μg/mL after 48 h and 10 μg/mL after 96 h. The essential oils disrupt the cellular membrane or cause extensive vacuolization of cytoplasm, resulting in eradicating the parasite 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> (
 <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Mehriardestani et al., 2017</xref>). These essential oils need to be screened and clinically evaluated further for their anti-trichomonal activity. 
 <xref rid="bib89" ref-type="bibr">van Vuuren and Naidoo (2010)</xref> also tested essential oils from 
 <italic>Croton gratissimus</italic> and 
 <italic>Tarchonanthus</italic>. However, they were found to be ineffective against 
 <italic>T vaginalis.</italic>
