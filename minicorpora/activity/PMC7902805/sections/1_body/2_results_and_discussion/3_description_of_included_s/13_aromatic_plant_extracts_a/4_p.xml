<p id="p0255">Black seed or black cumin or 
 <italic>Nigella sativa</italic> L., which belongs to the Ranunculaceae, has a widespread culinary and traditional medicinal usage in the Mediterranean and Indian subcontinent. 
 <italic>Nigella sativa</italic> L. seeds have been reported to possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-fungal, anti-infective, and anti-parasitic properties. The effect of aqueous extract of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> was compared with metronidazole on the growth and motility of 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> (
 <xref rid="bib88" ref-type="bibr">Tonkal, 2009</xref>). Aqueous extract of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> was found to possess a remarkable effect on the growth of 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic>. To further elucidate the mechanism and understand the effect of fatty acids of 
 <italic>N. sativa,</italic>
 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Mahmoud et al. (2016)</xref> undertook a study to compare the efficacy of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> oil, aqueous extract, and alcoholic extract of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> on 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic>. It was found that 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> oil at a concentration of 2 mg/mL, and alcoholic extract at a concentration of 10 mg/mL, exhibited similar activity as that of metronidazole (50 μg/mL) after 24 h. The aqueous extract was found to have less effect on 
 <italic>T. vaginalis.</italic> This difference in the activity was attributed to the fatty acids present in 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> oil and those extracted in the alcoholic extract of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic>. The lowest anti-trichomonal activity of aqueous extract of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> was ascribed to the absence of major fatty acids, viz., oleic acid, and linoleic acid, in the aqueous extract. Remarkably, the fatty acids tridecanoic acid and palmitoleic acid were found only in the oil of 
 <italic>N. sativa.</italic> The authors proposed a possible mechanism of action that suggests the cell membrane of 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> as the main target. It is presumed that fatty acids in the oil and alcoholic extract may interact with the cell membranes, resulting in transient or permanent variable size pores. This formation of pores results in leakage, reduced nutrient uptake, or cellular respiration inhibition in 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> (
 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Mahmoud et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, oil and alcoholic extract of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> are potentially bioactive against 
 <italic>T. vaginalis.</italic>
