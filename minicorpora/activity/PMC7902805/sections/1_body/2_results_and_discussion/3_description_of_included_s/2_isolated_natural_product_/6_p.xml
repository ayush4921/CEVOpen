<p id="p0115">Considering berberine as one of the important constituents of plant 
 <italic>Argemone mexicana</italic>, very recently, 
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Elizondo-Luevano et al. (2020)</xref> compared the anti-trichomonal effect of methanolic extract of leaves and stem of the plant with pristine berberine and metronidazole as a standard control. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of stem and leaf extracts of 
 <italic>Argemone mexicana</italic> against 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> were 70.8 and 67.2 μg/mL, respectively. Although the values observed were not comparable to that of metronidazole, IC
 <sub>50</sub> 0.1 μg/mL, they were comparable to pure berberine of IC
 <sub>50</sub> 40.7 μg/mL.
