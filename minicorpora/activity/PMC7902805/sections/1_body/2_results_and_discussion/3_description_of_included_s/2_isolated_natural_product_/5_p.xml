Berberine hydrochloride intravaginal therapy had shown significant improvement in bacterial vaginosis patients' clinical symptoms as observed from a reduction in oxidative stress in vaginal discharge and apoptosis of vaginal epithelial cells. The activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase were noted as reduced levels of malondialdehyde and hydrogen peroxide (
