<p id="p0235">Saponins from 
 <italic>Sapindus mukorossi</italic> showed anti-
 <italic>Trichomonas</italic> activity at a 10-fold lower concentration than required for effective spermicidal activity against human spermatozoa, thus suggesting the potential of these saponins for the development of a safe spermicidal and microbicide for human use (

 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Jain et al. (2014)</xref> combined a synthetic spermicide with a natural saponin trichomonacide for safe, prophylactic contraception. This study's anti-trichomonal saponins were a fully standardized mixture of six sapindosides (sapindosides A, B, C, D, and mukurozisaponins E1 and Y1), with sapindoside B as the major constituent. They were isolated from the fruit pericarp of 
 <italic>Sapindus mukorossi</italic> Gaerth (family Sapindaceae) by 
 <italic>n</italic>-butanol extraction of its ethanolic extract. The combination of saponin with synthetic spermicide resulted in lowering the anti-trichomonal MIC of synthetic spermicide from 285 μg/mL to 32.8285 μg/mL.
