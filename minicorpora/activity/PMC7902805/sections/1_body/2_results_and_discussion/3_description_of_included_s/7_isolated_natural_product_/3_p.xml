<p id="p0180">This natural alkaloid has immense therapeutic potential as it has shown high specificity in a very low concentration against several cancers both 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and against various drug-resistant cancer cells (
 <xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr">Roy et al., 2018</xref>). Recently, lycorine showed anti-viral activity against the Zika virus 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> (

 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Giordani et al. (2011)</xref> studied the cytotoxicity of lycorine against 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> covering a very broad range of concentrations from 2.5 to 1000 μM. Cell cycle analysis and observations of ultrastructural alterations in the parasitic cell were analyzed by flow cytometry and transmission electron microscopy, respectively, after treatment with 250 μM lycorine for 6 and 24 h. Significant changes occurred, including disruption in the trophozoite's original shape and a few depressions on its surface. Although apoptotic blebs were not seen, the nucleus looked abnormal in shape, e.g., elongated or split. Several cytoplasmic vacuoles resembling an autophagic process were observed. Randomly spread hydrogenosomes were also seen within the parasite cells. Fragments of the endoplasmic reticulum were seen in close contact with abnormal hydrogenosomes, indicative of autophagy. Lycorine arrested the T. vaginalis cell cycle at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, although no apoptosis hallmarks, such as apoptotic bodies, were observed. Consequently, the underlying mechanism of action fails to fulfill the criteria for apoptosis completely. However, some similarities to paraptotic cell death were observed (
