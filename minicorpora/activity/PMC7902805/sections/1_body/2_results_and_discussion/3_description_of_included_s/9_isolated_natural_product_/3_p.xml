<p id="p0200">It is a spice used in Chinese cuisine and is also part of the Chinese Traditional Medicine. 
 <italic>A. tsai-ko</italic> is effective for the treatment of stomach disorders and throat infection (and exhibits a wide range of biological activities, such as antimicrobial, antioxidant, and cytotoxic activities, as well as lipid-lowering effects). Geraniol is a widely used fragrance ingredient and is the main component of 
 <italic>A. tsao-ko</italic> essential oil, constituting approximately 14%. Geraniol has antimicrobial activity, insecticidal, and antitumor activity (
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2011</xref>). Both 
 <italic>A. tsao-ko</italic> essential oil and geraniol showed 
 <italic>in-vitro</italic> anti-
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> activity against two different parasite isolates. 
 <italic>A. tsao-ko</italic> essential oil was found to be 4-8-fold more effective than that of geraniol; however, it was 10-fold less active than metronidazole, 20-fold less than ornidazole. 
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Dai et al. (2016)</xref> further explored the mechanism of activity of 
 <italic>A. tsao-ko</italic> essential oil and geraniol against 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> using direct visualization with transmission electron microscopy. Several morphological changes were observed in the treated cells, such as many vacuoles, disappearance of ribosomes, dilation of rough endoplasmic reticulum, and dissolving nuclei. The leakage of cytoplasmic contents was also observed.
