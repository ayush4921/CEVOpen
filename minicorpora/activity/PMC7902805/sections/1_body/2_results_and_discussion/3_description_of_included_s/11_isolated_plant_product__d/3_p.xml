<p id="p0220">Betulinic acid and ursolic acid were isolated from barks of 
 <italic>Platanus acerifolia</italic>, and 
 <italic>Malus domestica</italic> peels, respectively (
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Innocente et al., 2014</xref>), and semisynthetic derivatives of both were prepared. Compounds obtained from betulinic acid presented better activity than those from ursolic acid. Piperazine derivatized from betulinic acid presented a minimum inhibitory concentration of 91.2 μM, revealing these compounds' high potential as trichomonacidal agents.
