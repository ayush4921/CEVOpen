 <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Mallo et al. (2013)</xref> explored the 
 <italic>in-vitro</italic> antitrichomonal effect and mechanism of action of resveratrol on 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> trophozoites. At concentrations between 25 and 100 μM, resveratrol inhibited the growth of 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> trophozoites. The lower dose of 25 μM exerted a cytostatic effect, whereas higher doses exerted killing effects. Resveratrol, at a high dose, upregulated gene expression of the hydrogenosomal enzyme pyruvate-ferredoxin oxidoreductase. At doses lower than 100 μM but more than 50 μM, overexpression of heat shock protein 70, a protective protein found in the hydrogenosome of 
 <italic>T. vaginalis,</italic> was observed. The results demonstrated that resveratrol exerts its deleterious effects as anti-trichomonas via hydrogenosomal dysfunction and metabolic alteration (
