 <xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">Omisore et al. (2005)</xref> studied the anti-trichomonas activity of 
 <italic>Dorstenia barteri</italic>, and 
 <italic>Dorstenia convexa</italic> extracts, and some isolated components from 
 <italic>D. barteri</italic> against 
 <italic>T. gallinarum</italic> and compared with quercetin and quercitrin. Quercetin was found to be most potent, followed by quercitrin. Minimum lethal concentrations were found to be 0.121., 0.244, 0.244, 0.73, and 0.98 μg/mL for quercetin, quercitrin, bartericin B, bartericin A, and stigmasterol, respectively, and for 6,8-diprenyleridictyol, isobavachalcone, and dorsmanin F, similar activity was noted i.e., 31.25 μg/mL. In the same study, researchers studied minimum lethal concentrations for the extract of leaves and twigs of both the 
 <italic>Dorstenia</italic> species. Extracts were prepared using a 1:1 organic solvent mixture of dichloromethane and methanol. At 24 h exposure, minimum lethal concentrations were found to be 15.625 and 15.625 μ/mL for extracts of leaves and twig of 
 <italic>D. barteri,</italic> whereas leaf and twig extract of 
 <italic>D. convexa</italic> exhibited much higher minimum lethal concentrations as 125 and 437.5 μg/mL, respectively.
