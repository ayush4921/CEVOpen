<p id="p0130">A systematic meta-analysis was carried out to study the safety of curcumin (
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Chainani, 2003</xref>). This meta-analysis included various research articles, book chapters, 
 <italic>in-vitro</italic> studies, human trials from 1966 to 2003. The metanalysis reported that curcumin is a well-tolerated compound and is safe in at least six human clinical trials. Moreover, curcumin can be administered topically, which will further reduce the likelihood of side effects associated with metronidazole's oral administration. Thus, curcumin holds a promise as a potential anti-trichomoniasis candidate of plant origin. However, the poor aqueous solubility of curcumin limits its widespread therapeutic utilization. To overcome the poor aqueous solubility (
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Carapina da Silva et al., 2019</xref>) synthesized 21 monocarbonyl analogs of curcumin that possessed anti-protozoal activity. Out of these 21 compounds, three derivates, 1,5-diphenylpenta-1,4-dien-3-one, 1,5-bis(2-chlorophenyl) penta-1,4-dien-3-one, and 2,6-bis(2-chlorobenzylidene) cyclohexanone, were found to have comparable anti-trichomoniasis activity as that of metronidazole. All the three derivates eradicated
