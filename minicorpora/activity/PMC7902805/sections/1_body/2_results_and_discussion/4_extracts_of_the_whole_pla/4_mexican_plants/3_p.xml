<p id="p0300">As observed in 
 <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>, 
 <italic>Carica papaya</italic> and 
 <italic>Cocos nucifera</italic>, showed the best anti-trichomonas activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 5.6 and 5.8 μg/mL, respectively. Moderate activity was observed with the species 
 <italic>Bocconia frutescens</italic>, 
 <italic>Geranium mexicanum</italic>, and 
 <italic>Lygodium venustum</italic> with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values 30.9–60.9 μg/mL. The rest of the plants are considered ineffective as the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were considerably greater than 100 μg/mL. Although effective anti-trichomonal, all plants were still very less effective than metronidazole with 0.037 μg/mL.
