<p id="p0265">One such plant that has been found to possess potential anti-trichomonas activity is 
 <italic>Eucalyptus camaldulensis</italic>; growth-inhibitory activity against 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> has been reported for the extract of 
 <italic>E. camaldulensis</italic> (
 <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Mehriardestani et al., 2017</xref>). 
 <italic>E. camaldulensis</italic> or the River Red Gun tree belongs to the genus 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> and family Myrtaceae. 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> trees are well known for their adaptability and ability to grow fast. Consequently, 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> is one of the widely grown plants globally. Of the 800 species in the 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> genus, 
 <italic>E. camaldulensis</italic> is one the most grown. Being a native of Australia and Tasmania, 
 <italic>E. camaldulensis</italic> is a widely used medicinal plant in Aboriginal society and Australia's traditional medicinal system (
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Aleksic Sabo and Knezevic, 2019</xref>). The medicinal application of 
 <italic>E. camaldulensis</italic> ranges from treating gastrointestinal disorders, e.g., diarrhea, colic, and dysentery, to respiratory diseases such as colds, coughs, laryngitis, and sore throat (
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Aleksic Sabo and Knezevic, 2019</xref>). It has also been traditionally used to arrest bleeding and joint pain. However, it is used as a folk medicine globally. Smoked leaves of 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> are used to alleviate respiratory issues in Sudan, while its decoction is used for treating coughs and colds in Zimbabwe. Nigerian people use its stem for oral hygiene. The medicinal properties of 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> are attributed to its chemical constituents. 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> is rich in essential oils ~0.4%, primarily 1,8-cineole (~77%). Other major constituents are cuminal, phellandrene, aromadendrene (or aromadendral), valerylaldehyde, geraniol, cymene, and phellandral. The leaves also contain a considerable quantity of tannins (
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Ghasemian et al., 2019</xref>). 
 <italic>E. camaldulensis</italic> has been proven to possess a diverse range of medicinal properties such as anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-viral, and anti-protozoal. The first reported anti-trichomonas activity of 
 <italic>E. camaldulensis</italic> was by Mahdi and co-workers (
 <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Mahdi et al., 2006</xref>). This group reported that an aqueous extract of 
 <italic>E. camaldulensis</italic> leaves (at a concentration of 500 mg/mL) at pH 5.35 resulted in eradicating 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> at the end of 24 h (
 <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Mahdi et al., 2006</xref>). Later, a couple of other groups further confirmed this finding in independent research. 
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Hassani et al. (2013)</xref> evaluated five different types of 
 <italic>E. camaldulensis</italic> extract on 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> (
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Hassani et al., 2013</xref>). The group evaluated total extract, diethyl ether, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and water fractions of 
 <italic>E. camaldulensis in vitro.</italic> The growth-inhibitory activity was found with all the extracts. The potency of all the extracts for the growth inhibition of 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> can be ranked as ethyl acetate extract &gt; crude extract &gt; diethyl ether extract &gt; water extract. Ethyl acetate extract exhibited 100% growth inhibition of 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> at a concentration of 12.5 mg/mL at the end of 24 h, while the water extract exhibited 80% growth inhibition at a concentration of 50 mg/mL at the end of 24 h (
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Hassani et al., 2013</xref>). Around the same time, the findings of another group further strengthened these results. 
 <xref rid="bib93" ref-type="bibr">Youse et al. (2012)</xref> compared alcoholic and water extracts of 
 <italic>Echinophora platyloba, Stachys lavandulifolia</italic>, and 
 <italic>E. camaldulensis</italic> for 
 <italic>in-vitro</italic> activity against 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> (
 <xref rid="bib93" ref-type="bibr">Youse et al., 2012</xref>)
 <italic>.</italic> Out of the three plant extracts, only the extracts of 
 <italic>E. camaldulensis</italic> exhibited 
 <italic>in-vitro</italic> activity against 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic>. Based on these findings, 
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Aslani et al. (2019)</xref> developed a vaginal cream containing extract of 
 <italic>E. camaldulensis</italic> along with extract of 
 <italic>Viola odorata</italic> and 
 <italic>Mentha piperita</italic> (
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Aslani et al., 2019</xref>). A cream formulation containing 2.5 mg/mL of 
 <italic>E. camaldulensis</italic>, 0.06 mg/mL of 
 <italic>V. odorata</italic>, and 1 mg/mL of 
 <italic>M. piperita</italic> was found to inhibit 100% growth of 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> at the end of 24 h
 <italic>.</italic> While the formulation containing 1.25 mg/mL of 
 <italic>E. camaldulensis</italic>, 0.03 mg/mL of 
 <italic>V. odorata</italic>, and 0.5 mg/mL of 
 <italic>M. piperita</italic> exhibited only 92% of growth inhibition at the end (
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Ghasemian et al., 2019</xref>) of 24 h.
