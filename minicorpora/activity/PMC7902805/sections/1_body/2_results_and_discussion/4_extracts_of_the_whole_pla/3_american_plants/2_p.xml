<p id="p0270">In a very exhaustive experiment, 
 <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Muelas-Serrano et al. (2000)</xref> systematically explored the anti-trichomonas activity of various aqueous and organic extracts of different parts of more than 40 South American plants belonging to 20 different families known for their immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and anti-protozoal effects (
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Cytocidal and cytostatic activities against 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> strain JH31A no. 4 were evaluated concerning control cultures. 
 <italic>Mikania cordifolia</italic> (Linnaeus f.) Willdenow and 
 <italic>Neurolaena lobata</italic> (L.) R. Br. from the Asteraceae and 
 <italic>Scutia buxifolia</italic> Reiss from the Ramnaceae were the most active extracts amongst all the plants examined.
