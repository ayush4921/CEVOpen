<p id="p0320">Trichomoniasis is considered a re-emerging disease, and drug resistance against metronidazole or 5-nitro imidazole family, the first-line drug for treating trichomoniasis, is on the rise. Lack of alternative treatment options for trichomoniasis is a serious clinical threat, and there is a critical need to have alternative drugs for its management. Traditional/folk medicines that are in practice in various countries have carved out the pathway for anti-trichomonal drug research. Whole-plant extracts and phytoconstituents form a major part of these traditional anti-trichomonal medicines. Negligible adverse events are one of the major benefits of using plant-based medicines. Much research has been carried out on such phytoconstituents or extracts, and their therapeutic utility has been established. However, most of this research is sparse and is mostly limited to 
 <italic>in-vitro</italic> studies. These studies have revealed several promising phytoconstituents or plant extracts that need to be evaluated in experimental models and clinical settings. Many potential phytochemicals have been evaluated for them 
 <italic>in-vitro</italic> anti-trichomonas activity but have not been explored subsequently. It is desired that further research should focus on the clinical efficacy of these phytoconstituents or plant extracts. Concerted efforts are needed to take these potential phytoconstituents/plants for therapeutic usage.
