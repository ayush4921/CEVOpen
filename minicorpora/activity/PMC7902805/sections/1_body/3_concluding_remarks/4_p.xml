<p id="p0330">However, considering the limited quality of included evidence and heterogeneity of different studies, more well-design studies are required to further confirm the conclusion. We recommend that future studies focus on the intensity and treatment duration of selected plant material or isolated phytoconstituents and pay more attention to safety profiles. Moreover, a better understanding of the selected active constituents' mechanism of action is needed to help researchers and clinical professionals pursue further studies. Structure-activity relationship studies will also help identify the essential structural features of the selected molecule.</p>
