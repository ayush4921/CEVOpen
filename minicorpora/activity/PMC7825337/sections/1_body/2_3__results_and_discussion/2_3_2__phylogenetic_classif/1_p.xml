<p>Extensive phylogenetic analyses of 
 <italic>Ferula dureana</italic> were carried out [
 <xref rid="B30-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] to elucidate its taxonomic position. Based on the results of nrDNA ITS tree analysis 
 <italic>F. drudeana</italic> was classified in the same group as 
 <italic>F. huber-morathii</italic> Peşmen another endemic species of Anatolia. On the other hand, concatenated pDNA tree analysis places 
 <italic>F. drudeana</italic> in a completely different position that has no direct relation to 
 <italic>F. huber-morathii</italic> but is closer to two other Anatolian endemic 
 <italic>Ferula</italic> species (i.e., 
 <italic>F. anatolica</italic> Boiss. and 
 <italic>F. coskunii</italic> Sağıroğlu and Duman). However, the best maximum likelihood tree inferred from the 148 ITS sequences placed 
 <italic>F. drudeana</italic> in the same group with 
 <italic>F. szowitsiana</italic> DC. Despite the application of sophisticated molecular-level analyses, none of those taxonomic classifications appear to be consistent with the traditional systematic taxonomy and chemotaxonomic classification of 
 <italic>F. drudeana</italic> [
 <xref rid="B25-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].
