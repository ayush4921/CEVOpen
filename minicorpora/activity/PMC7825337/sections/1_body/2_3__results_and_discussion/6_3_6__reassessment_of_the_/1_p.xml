<p>Herodotus described the limits of the “country of silphion” as starting from the island of Platea to the entrance of the Gulf of Syrtis [

 <italic>F. drudeana</italic> always appear after the heavy spring downpour, as mentioned by Pliny the Elder’s mythical “black rain”: “We find it stated by the most trustworthy among the Greek writers (presumably Theophrastus), that this plant made its appearance near the gardens of the Hesperides and the Greater Syrtis, immediately after the earth had been soaked on a sudden by a shower as black as pitch. This took place seven years before the foundation of the city of Cyrenae, and in the year of Rome 143” [

Scientifically, it is impossible to claim that a plant species, that is distributed as widely as is mentioned in the historical records, appears on a single night. In contrast, the silphion plant must have been developed into its ancient glory over the hundreds of thousands of years. Regardless of its biological development history, how could a plant species that grew on such a widespread area became extinct? Pliny the Elder described a steep decline of the population of silphion plant in the Cyrenaica region and sites that “For these many years past, however, it has not been found in Cyrenaica, as the farmers of revenue who holds the lands there on lease, have a notion that it is more profitable to depasture flocks of sheep upon them. Within the memory of the present generation, a single stalk is all that has ever been found there, and that was sent as a curiosity to the Emperor Nero” [

Even Theophrastus describes the application of certain regulations during the harvest of silphion juice: “They have regulations, like those in use in mines, for cutting the root, in accordance with which they fix carefully the proper amount to be cut, having regard to previous cuttings and the supply of plant. For it is not allowed to cut it wrong nor to cut more than the appointed amount; for, if the juice is kept and not used, it goes bad and decays” [
