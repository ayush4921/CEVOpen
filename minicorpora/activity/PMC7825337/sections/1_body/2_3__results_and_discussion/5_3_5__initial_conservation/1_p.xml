<p>Theophrastus of Eresos suggested that silphion is a wild plant and avoids cultivated land in the “Enquiry into Plants” [
 <xref rid="B9-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], yet he indicated that “digging around the root improves the quality of silphion due to the change of soil”; however, such a statement directly contradicts his previous comments. Pliny the Elder also emphasized the resistance of silphion to the cultivation by declaring that any attempted cultivation “will leave the spot where it has been sown quite desolate and barren” in his Natural History [
 <xref rid="B13-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Moreover, Hippocrates mentions that cultivation attempts in Ionia and the Peloponnesus failed [
 <xref rid="B8-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Nevertheless, letters of Synesius that describe his observation of the cultivated silphion plants [
 <xref rid="B19-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] contradict Theophrastus’, Pliny’s and Hippocrates’ statements about the resistance of silphion plant to cultivation.
