<p>Since the majority of the known morphological descriptions of silphion were reported by Theophrastus [
 <xref rid="B9-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and Pliny the Elder [
 <xref rid="B13-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], their descriptions will be used to illustrate the similarities between the parts of silphion plant and those of 
 <italic>Ferula drudeana</italic>. In addition, despite their exaggerated representations, numismatic figures of the silphion plant on the Cyrenaic coins were utilized to compare the macro-morphology of 
 <italic>F. drudeana</italic> to the silphion plant.
