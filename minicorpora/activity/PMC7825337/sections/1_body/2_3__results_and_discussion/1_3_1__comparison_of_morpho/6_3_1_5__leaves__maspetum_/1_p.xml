<p>Pliny the Elder described the leaves of silphion as: “The leaves of this plant were known as “maspetum,” and bore considerable resemblance to parsley” in his “Natural History” [
 <xref rid="B13-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The leaf segments of 
 <italic>Ferula drudeana</italic> are not as broad as the typical parsley leaf segment. This difference may be due to the ecological transformation of 
 <italic>F. drudeana</italic> in its current location over the 2000 years of growth cycles, and perhaps, 
 <italic>F. drudeana</italic> is an ecotype of the silphion plant. An alternate explanation of this discrepancy could be due to the morphological variations of basal leaf segments of 
 <italic>Ferula</italic> species; there are several examples of such variations known from other 
 <italic>Ferula</italic> species, such as 
 <italic>F. tingitana</italic> L. and 
 <italic>F. elaeochytris</italic> Korovin [
