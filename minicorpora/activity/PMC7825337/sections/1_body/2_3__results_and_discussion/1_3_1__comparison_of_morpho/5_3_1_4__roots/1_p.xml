<p>According to Theophrastus of Eresos, silphion had a thick root with black bark and grows to the length of a cubit (ca. 46 cm) or a little longer [
 <xref rid="B9-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The root of 
 <italic>F. drudeana</italic> is very wide, often as wide as. 20â€“25 cm at the top section (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00102-f005">Figure 5</xref>). As described by Theophrastus, the color of the root bark was black and the length of the fully excavated root of silphion is well over a cubit in length. In addition, Pliny the Elder in his Natural History [
 <xref rid="B13-plants-10-00102" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], described the roots of silphion as numerous and thick. Consistent with this description the root of 
 <italic>F. drudeana</italic> always divides into several thick branches ca. 20 cm below the basal leaves of the plant under the ground.
