0: Silphion (= Silphium) refers to an oleo-gum-resin of a well-known ancient medicinal plant [ 1].
1: Due to its numerous therapeutic uses [ 2, 3] and spice qualities [ 4], it was the major economic resource of the Cyrenaic region of Libya [ 5] for six centuries.
2: The kings of Cyrene endeavored to retain the monopoly of silphion trade, nevertheless, a certain amount was smuggled to the Carthaginians, and Carthage became a supplier of silphion to some extent [ 6].
3: Although wide-spread trading of silphion in the Mediterranean region was initiated with the establishment of the Greek colonization of the Cyrenaic region, the commercial source must have been well developed prior to these large-scale trading practices and there is even some fragmented evidence in Minoan pictograms that suggests the presence of silphion production in the Late Bronze Age [ 1, 7, 8].
4: Since the natural habitat of the silphion plant was near Egypt, one might wonder about the awareness of ancient Egyptians regarding the presence and medicinal values of the silphion plant.
5: Indeed, there is some archaeological and linguistic evidence indicating that ancient Egyptians knew about silphion and used it in Egyptian rituals such as the renewal of the Kings vigor in the Old Kingdom [ 1, 8].
