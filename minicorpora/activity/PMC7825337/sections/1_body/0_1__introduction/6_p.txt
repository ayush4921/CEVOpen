0: A rare and endemic species of  Ferula growing near Central Anatolia closely resembles the description and numismatic figures of silphion ( Figure 1).
1: Furthermore, the organoleptic qualities of its oleo-gum-resin exudate are also in close agreement with the description of silphion juice by Dioscorides [ 13].
2: Preliminary phytochemical analyses of the resin indicate the presence of highly complex sesquiterpenoids and coumarins with novel structures as well as other, known compounds.
3: The known compounds have been previously described from other medicinal plants such as sweet flag (i.e.,  Acorus calamus L.),  galbanum (i.e.,  Ferula gummosa Boiss.
4: ), rosemary (i.e.,  Rosmarinus officinalis L.), sage (i.e.,  Salvia sp.)
5: and artichoke (i.e.,  Cynara scolymus L.).
6: The known biological activities of these compounds corroborate the medical uses of silphion mentioned in the monograph of Dioscorides and other sources [ 2, 13, 14].
