0: Only small populations of the endemic  Ferula species, here considered to represent the silphion plant, exist in three locations in Anatolia all associated with the locations of former Greek villages.
1: These locations were discovered serendipitously with the help of local villagers, and these plant populations grow in protected enclaves such as stone-walled orchards.
2: No other populations have been found to exist except for a small population found in an adjacent lot of the original plant material collection site.
3: Conservation studies have been initiated to preserve and propagate this species.
4: Details of the initial conservation study and training of the local villagers to protect this plant species while providing them potentially valuable economic resource will be discussed.
