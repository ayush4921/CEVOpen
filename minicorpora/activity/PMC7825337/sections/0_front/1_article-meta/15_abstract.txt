0: Silphion was an ancient medicinal gum-resin; most likely obtained from a   Ferula species growing in the Cyrene region of Libya ca.
1: 2500 years ago.
2: Due to its therapeutic properties and culinary value, silphion became the main economic commodity of the Cyrene region.
3: It is generally believed that the source of silphion became extinct in the first century AD.
4: However, there are a few references in the literature about the cultivated silphion plant and its existence up to the fifth century.
5: Recently, a rare and endemic   Ferula species that produces a pleasant-smelling gum-resin was found in three locations near formerly Greek villages in Anatolia.
6: Morphologic features of this species closely resemble silphion, as it appears in the numismatic figures of antique Cyrenaic coins, and conform to descriptions by ancient authors.
7: Initial chemical and pharmacological investigations of this species have confirmed the medicinal and spice-like quality of its gum-resin supporting a connection with the long-lost silphion.
8: A preliminary conservation study has been initiated at the growth site of this rare endemic   Ferula species.
9: The results of this study and their implications on the regional extinction event, and future development of this species will be discussed.
