0: Alzheimers disease (AD) is a gradually growing irreversible illness of the brain that almost affects every fifth person (aged > 80 years) in the world.
1: World Health Organization (WHO) also revealed that the prevalence of this disease will enhance (upto double) significantly upto 2030.
2: The poor cholinergic transmission at the synapse is considered to be one of the main reasons behind the progression and occurrence of this disorder.
3: Natural inhibitors of acetylcholine (ACh) such as galanthamine and rivastigmine are used commercially in the treatmentof AD.
4: The biomolecules such assesquiterpenes, possess a great structural diversity and are responsible for a plethora of pharmacological properties.
5: The potential of various sesquiterpenes as anticholinesterase has been reviewed in this article.
6: For this purpose, the various databases, mainly PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were investigatedwith different keywords such as sesquiterpenes+acetylcholinesterase and sesquiterpenes+cholinesterase+inhibitors in the surveyed time frame (20102020).
7: A vast literature was evident in the last decade, which affirms the potential of various sesquiterpenes in the improvement of cholinergic transmission by inhibiting the AChE.
8: After data analysis, it was found that 12 compounds out of a total of 58 sesquiterpenes were reported to possess IC  50< 9 M and can be considered as potential candidates for the improvement of learning and memory.
9: Sesquiterpene is an important category of terpenoids, found to possess a large spectrum of biological activities.
10: The outcome of the review clearly states that sesquiterpenes (such as amberboin, lipidiol, etc.)
11: from herbs could offer fresh, functional compounds for possible prevention and treatment of AD.
