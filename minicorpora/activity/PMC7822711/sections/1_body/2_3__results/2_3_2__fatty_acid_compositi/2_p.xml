<p>The saturated fatty acids identified in the crude oil were myristic, palmitic, palmitoleic, stearic, and arachidic. There were no significant differences (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05) in saturated fatty acid compositions in baobab seed oil. The highest and lowest composition quantity values of saturated fatty acids were found for baobab oil sample collected from Iringa and Dodoma regions, respectively. The average amount of saturated fatty acids was myristic 0.28-0.34%, palmitic 14.99-20.48%, palmitoleic 0.78-0.99%, stearic 1.15-2.16%, and arachidic 0.26-0.733%. The highest amount of palmitic fatty acid as opposed to other saturated fatty acids was detected in baobab seed oil. Furthermore, myristic acids were present in all the samples, although in low concentrations (&lt;0.5%).
