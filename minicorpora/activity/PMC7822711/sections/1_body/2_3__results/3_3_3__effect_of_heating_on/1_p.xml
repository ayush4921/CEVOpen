<p>Fatty acid (saturated, unsaturated, and cyclic fatty acids) results from the three regions were pooled together and considered as one sample since there were no observed significant differences in fatty acid composition. There was no significant main effect on fatty acid compositions (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.125) when the samples were subjected to heating at a temperature of 150°C within 20 minutes. However, there was a significant main effect of temperature at 200°C on fatty acid compositions (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.15). In addition, there was a significant main effect of temperature at 250°C on fatty acid compositions (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) within 20 minutes.
