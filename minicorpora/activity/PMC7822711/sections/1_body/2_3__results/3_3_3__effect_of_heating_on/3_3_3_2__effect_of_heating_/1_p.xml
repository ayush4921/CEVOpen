<p>At all the three temperatures (150°C, 200°C, and 250°C), the quantity of unsaturated fatty acids decreased as the temperature increased, probably due to degradation of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Remarkably, the quantity of oleic acid increased with an increase in temperature. The unsaturated fatty acids that decreased with an increase in temperature included vaccenic, linoleic, linolenic, and arachidonic acids (
