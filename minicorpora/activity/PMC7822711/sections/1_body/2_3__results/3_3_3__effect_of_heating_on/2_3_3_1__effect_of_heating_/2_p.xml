<p>In this study, heating temperatures had a marked effect on the fatty acid compositions. The saturated fatty acids such as palmitic, stearic, and arachidic showed an increase in composition at 150Â°C, while palmitoleic and myristic remained almost constant with changing heating temperatures. For the saturated fatty acids, compositions increased with an increase in temperatures. Interestingly, myristic, palmitic, palmitoleic, and arachidic increased with an increase in temperature (
