<p>The results showed that heating temperature (range of the heating temperatures) had an influence on the fatty acid composition. There was a slight increase in temperature up to 200째C in the majority of the saturated fatty acids regardless of heating duration (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). It was interesting to observe that different saturated fatty acid compositions responded differently to changing temperatures. For example, a sharp increment of the percentage composition was observed during the first ten minutes of heating (at 150, 200, and 250째C) for palmitic acid and a slight increase was observed after 10 minutes of heating at different temperatures. However, myristic, stearic, and palmitoleic acid percentage compositions decreased with an increase in temperature (&gt;250째C). All saturated fatty acid compositions decreased at a temperature of 250째C. There was a significant difference (
