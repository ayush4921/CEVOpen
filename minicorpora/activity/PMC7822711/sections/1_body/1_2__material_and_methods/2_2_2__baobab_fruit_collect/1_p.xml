<p>The baobab fruits were collected during an ecological survey in Dodoma, Iringa, and Kilimanjaro regions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The selection criteria for the regions were the presence, accessibility, and use of baobab trees and their products. Nine 
 <italic>A. digitata</italic> trees (three baobab trees in each region) were randomly selected for the collection of mature fruits. About 20 baobab mature and intact fruits were harvested from each tree. These fruits were collected during the dry season (August 2018â€“February 2019). The geographical and environmental data were recorded in each sampled tree (
