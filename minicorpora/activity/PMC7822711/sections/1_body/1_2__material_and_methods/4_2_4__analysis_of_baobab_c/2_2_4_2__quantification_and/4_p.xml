 <italic>(3) Derivative Formation</italic>. The methyl esters were reacted with 15 ml of anhydrous methanol saturated with silver nitrate. The reaction was carried out for 20 hours at room temperature. The normal methyl esters and the reaction products from cyclopropenes were recovered from the reaction mixture by adding 30 ml of distilled water and by extracting twice with 10 ml of petroleum ether. The combined ether fractions were dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and evaporated to a small volume in a stream of nitrogen. For the oils that contained a large amount of cyclopropenoid fatty acids (&gt;5.0%), for example, the petroleum ether solution of methyl esters, the reaction products were directly injected into the gas-liquid chromatograph. In this experiment, baobab crude oil was considered to have a low level of CPFAs. Then, 1 
 <italic>μ</italic>l was injected into the GC under split mode of 60°C (Shimadzu GC-2010 equipped with an autosampler) with a capillary column, Supelco Carbowax size 30 m × 0.53 mm, injection temperature of 240°C, and detection temperature of 260°C under a flame ionization detector. The fatty acid methyl esters were identified by comparing retention with standard times and expressed as percentages of the total methyl esters.
