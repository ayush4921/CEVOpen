 <italic>(3) Refractive Index (RI)</italic>. The refractive index was measured at 25°C by a Pen Refractometer (Atago, Japan) with resolution and accuracy values of 0.1 and ±0.2 percent at 10-60°C. The refractometer was set at 583.9 nm and left warm for 30 minutes. The oil was poured on the double prism with the help of a screw head. The prisms were closed by tightening the screw heads. Then, the refractometer values were taken and translated using a conversion table.
