<p>Unsaturated fatty acid compositions decreased with an increase in temperatures probably due to the degradation of polyunsaturated fatty acids. A similar observation was made by Ali et al. [
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] during thermo-oxidative degradation of canola oil. A decrease in unsaturated fatty acids was mainly due to the reaction of oxygen with unsaturated fatty acids resulting in hydroperoxides, which immediately degraded in further radical reactions at heating temperatures. Our results are similar to the results in a study by Marr et al. [
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] who reported a decrease in the proportions of unsaturated fatty acids as temperature decreased. In our study, it was evident that heating temperatures had a noticeable effect on the CPFA and fatty acid compositions. For example, heating reduced all CPFA composition significantly below 0.4 percent. This is the recommended level for human consumption by [

 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. These would be the best temperatures in the refining process of the baobab oil. Similar observations were made by [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Therefore, heat might be a good method of reducing the cyclopropenoid fatty acids from the baobab seed oils making them fit for consumption. However, further studies on the composition of fatty acids and the physicochemical parameters of baobab seed oil after the CPFA removal are necessary to determine the effect of heat on the quality of oil.
