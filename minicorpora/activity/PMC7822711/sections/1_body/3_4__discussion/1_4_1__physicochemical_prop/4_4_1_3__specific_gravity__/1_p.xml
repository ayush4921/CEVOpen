<p>The obtained average SG for baobab crude oil values (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) from our study are within the WHO limit of between 0.91 and 0.93 [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The values are approximately similar to the values reported by Idris et al. [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] for the baobab oil. These values are within the range for vegetable oil such as the specific gravity ranges recommended by WHO/FAO for niger seed, sunflower, and palm oils of 0.917-0.92, 0.919-0.923, and 0.891-0.899, respectively [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The specific gravity indicates the purity of the oil. The lower the SG value the purer the oil and
