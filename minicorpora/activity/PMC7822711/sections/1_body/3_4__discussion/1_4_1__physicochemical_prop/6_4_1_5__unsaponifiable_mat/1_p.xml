<p>Unsaponifiable matter is that fraction of oils and fats which is not saponified by caustic alkali but is soluble in ordinary fat solvents. Unsaponifiable matters such as hydrocarbon, pigments, waxes, higher molecular weight alcohols, and sterols do not react with bases during the formation of soap. The average values obtained for the unsaponifiable matter from the three regions are similar to the value (1.7) reported by [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Also, Abubakar et al. [
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] reported unsaponifiable matter value for baobab oil of 1.46. The low unsaponifiable matter indicates that the oil can be used for biodiesel production [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Baobab seed oil has been reported as one of the most suitable feedstock for biodiesel production, according to the fatty acid methyl ester profile that becomes one of the key factors [
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Furthermore, low unsaponifiable matter of the baobab oil suggests that the oil could be edible because the observed value of unsaponifiable mater (
