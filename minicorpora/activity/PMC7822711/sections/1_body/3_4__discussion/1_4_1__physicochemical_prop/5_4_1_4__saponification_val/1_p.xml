<p>Saponification value determines the average chain length of the molecule and hence the estimated molecular weight of the fatty acid in the oil. Saponification equivalent is directly proportional to the average chain length of fatty acid present [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. For example, the higher the saponification value, the lower the average molecular weight [

 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) are approximately similar to the findings in a study by Nkafamiya et al. [
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] who recorded the saponification value of 196 ± 0.05 mgKOH/g for the baobab oil. The observed values are within the range of the other edible oils (187-196 mgKOH/g) and are used in soap making [

 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] observed that the saponification value of pepper fruit (
 <italic>Dennettia tripetala</italic>) oil was 159.33 mgKOH/g. Furthermore, a study by Nwinuka and Nwiloh [
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] reported that the saponification value of the African pear oil was 143.76 mgKOH/g. Higher unsaponifiable matter results in restively lower saponification value which implies that the oil is suitable for soap making [
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Baobab oil has been used in soap industries for many years in the world [
