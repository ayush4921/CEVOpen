<p>The iodine value has been used as a measure of the susceptibility of the oil to oxidation [
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The iodine value shows the amount of double bonds present and the degree of unsaturation of the fatty acids in the specific oil. The obtained average iodine value implies a low percentage of unsaturated fatty acids in the baobab seed oil (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Our results are similar to the results in a study by Nkafamiya et al. [
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] who reported the baobab oil iodine value (IV) of 87.9 ± 0.02 g/100 g, groundnut oil (84-99 g/100 g), olive (79-90 g/100 g), and castor oil (81-91 g/100 g). These ranges of iodine values suggest that the oil contains a low degree of unsaturation and can, therefore, be classified as nondrying edible oil because a range of 80-100 g/100 g iodine has been suggested for most edible oils [
