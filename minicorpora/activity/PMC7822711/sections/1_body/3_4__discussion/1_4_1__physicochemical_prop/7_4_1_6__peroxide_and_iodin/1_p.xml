<p>Peroxide value of oil measures the deterioration of oil over time. The higher the peroxide values, the lower the storage period of oil over time. The obtained average ranges for the baobab crude oil (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) are within the ranges of 0-10 mEq/kg stipulated for freshly prepared vegetable oil [
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Adebisi and Olagunju [
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] demonstrated that peroxide values greater than 10 mEq/kg were highly susceptible to autooxidation when exposed to moisture or trace elements. The obtained values in our study were close to the value obtained by Babiker et al. [
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] who reported the peroxide value for baobab oil of 4.08 mEq/kg. This suggests that the baobab oil has higher resistance to lipolytic hydrolysis and oxidation, and with proper storage conditions, it can be stored between 2 and 5 years without undergoing rancidity.
