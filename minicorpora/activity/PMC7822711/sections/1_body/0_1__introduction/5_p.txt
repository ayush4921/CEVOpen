0: Furthermore, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), baobab oil is not recommended as edible oil, neither is it classified in the group of vegetable oils.
1: Although the Government of Tanzania has banned the consumption of baobab oil, evidence shows that most people are still using baobab oil, which is known to have CPFAs, for the treatment of various diseases.
2: The baobab oil requires postextraction treatments such as heat treatments in reducing or removing these cyclopropenoid fatty acids from the baobab seed oils before they are fit for human consumption.
3: Accordingly, there is a need for characterizing and quantifying the levels of CPFAs in baobab seed oil and detecting the efficient method of removing/reducing their concentrations without impacting the quality of other fatty acids and oil quality.
4: Therefore, this study characterized the essential fatty acids and cyclopropenoid fatty acids (CPFAs) present and determined the effect of heat on cyclopropenoid fatty acids in baobab seed crude oil in the semiarid areas of Tanzania.
