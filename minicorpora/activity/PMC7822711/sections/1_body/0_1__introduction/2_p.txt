0: The Malvaceae family has seed oil that contains essential fatty acids including palmitic, oleic, linolenic, and cyclic fatty acids (cyclopropene fatty acids) [ 9].
1: It has been reported that cyclopropene fatty acids are often accompanied by a smaller proportion of cyclopropanic fatty acids such as dihydrosterculic and dihydromalvalic acids, which are the dihydro analogues of cyclopropene fatty acids [ 10].
2: Studies revealed that CPFAs occur in lipids of the plant species including the seeds of baobab of the order Malvaceae, Tiliaceae, Bombacaceae, and Sterculiaceae families [ 11 13].
3: The CPFAs, which have been reported as frequent and dominant in baobab seed oil include sterculic acid [8-(2-octyl-1-cyclopropenyl) octanoic acid] and malvalic acid [7-(2-octyl-1-cyclopropenyl) heptanoic acid] [ 14 21].
