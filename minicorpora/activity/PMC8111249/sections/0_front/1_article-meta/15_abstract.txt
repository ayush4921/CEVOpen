0: The present study was designed to assess the impact of dietary supplementation of lemongrass essential oil (  LGEO) on growth performance, carcass traits, liver and kidney function, immunity, antioxidant indices and caecal microbiota of growing quail.
1: A total of 200 Japanese quails at 1-week-old were haphazardly allotted to 5 groups of 40 chicks in five replicates (8 per replicate).
2: The first group was the control group, while LGEO was added at levels of 150, 300, 450, and 600 mg/kg diet in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th groups, respectively.
3: Dietary supplementation of LGEO (150, 300 and 450 mg/ kg diet) increased body weight at 3 and 5 wk of age, and increased body weight gain during all periods compared with the control group (  P< 0.05).
4: All levels of LGEO improved feed conversion ratio during the periods from 1 to 3 and 1 to 5 wk of age.
5: During 3 to 5 wk, feed conversion ratio was improved in quails fed LGEO (300 and 450 mg/kg diet) compared with the control and other treatments.
6: Carcass traits, plasma globulin, alanine aminotransferase, and urea values did not differ among the treatments (  P > 0.05), but the activity of aspartate aminotransferase in the plasma was significantly decreased (  P< 0.05) in LGEO-treated groups.
7: The total protein and albumin values were significantly increased (  P< 0.05) in quails fed levels of LGEO (except 600 mg/kg diet) compared with the control.
8: The inclusion of LGEO in quail diets improved (  P< 0.05) plasma lipid profile.
9: The dietary supplementation of LGEO increased (linear and quadratic,   P< 0.05) plasma immunoglobulins (IgM, IgG, and IgA) levels, lysozyme values and activities of superoxide dismutase, total antioxidant capacity, reduced glutathione and catalase compared with the control group.
10: The caecal   Coliform, E. coli and   Salmonella were lowered (  P< 0.0001) in the quails treated with all LGEO levels, but the total bacterial count and   Lactobacillus count were increased with dietary supplementation of LGEO levels (300 and 450 mg/kg) compared with those in the control group.
11: The activities of digestive enzymes were significantly higher in birds fed the diet supplemented with LGEO levels than those fed the control diet.
12: In conclusion, dietary supplementation of LGEO can improve the performance, lipid profile, immunity and antioxidant indices and decline intestinal pathogens and thus boost the health status of growing quail.
