<p>Finally, we have demonstrated the beneficial effect of ultrasound pretreatment on the overall extraction efficiency. In comparison to the control experiment, ultrasound-assisted extraction pretreatment caused a 50% improvement in sage and rosemary and 60% in bay laurel essential oil yield, similar to the results of reflux-assisted extraction. This is comparable with the results of other studies [

 <italic>Mentha piperita</italic> L., and 
 <italic>Origanum majorana</italic> L. leaves resulted in approximately 10% essential oil yield increase, compared to no-pretreatment control [

 <italic>Elettaria cardamomum</italic> L. seeds with ultrasonic pretreatment resulted in a 4.9% essential oil yield increase and extraction lasted less than an hour, compared to control, which lasted 6 h [

 <xref rid="B14-molecules-25-04818" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In conclusion, we report a high increase in essential oil yield after ultrasound pretreatment when compared to other studies, accompanied by the shortening of the extraction time when compared to the reflux-assisted extraction pretreatment.
