<p>We have tested the effect of different pretreatments using selected Mediterranean plants: rosemary, sage, and bay laurel, and demonstrated that different hydrodistillation pretreatments can improve the yield of respective essential oils. At the same time, the pretreatments did not significantly affect the quality of oils and their composition was comparable to no-pretreatment controls. For the first time, we have demonstrated that reflux extraction (e.g., soaking of milled plant material at 40 Â°C for one hour) could significantly improve essential oil yield.</p>
