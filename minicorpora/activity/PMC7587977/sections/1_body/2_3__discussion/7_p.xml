<p>In conclusion, we have demonstrated the valuable effects of ultrasound and reflux extraction hydrodistillation pretreatments on the yield of essential oils of sage, rosemary, and bay laurel. The benefit of ultrasound is short extraction time, while reflux extraction is performed at mild temperature. Thus, both pretreatments are considered as gentle extraction procedures, resulting in unchanged overall oil quality, as demonstrated by essential oil composition analyzed here. Also, our results point out that when assessing the effect of enzymes as a hydrodistillation pretreatment, proper experiment controls are necessary. In our case, the soaking of plant material in the water at 40 Â°C was enough to disrupt the cells and additional enzyme activity was redundant.</p>
