<p>We hypothesized that different hydrodistillation pretreatments, namely, ultrasound-assisted extraction, reflux extraction, and enzyme-assisted reflux extraction, can improve the yield of essential oils of selected Mediterranean wild plants: sage (
 <italic>Salvia officinalis</italic> L.), rosemary (
 <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> L.), and bay laurel (
 <italic>Laurus nobilis</italic> L.). Also, we hypothesized that these relatively mild pretreatments will not adversely affect the chemical composition of essential oils.
