<p>The chemical composition of obtained essential oils was analyzed by GC-MS (

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), that is, the oil composition was comparable to the no-pretreatment control, as confirmed by Spearman’s test performed using GC-MS data (Supplementary file 2, 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-04818">Figures S20–S22</xref>). GC-MS analysis showed that the essential oils of all plants were richest in monoterpenes: up to 74%, 71%, and 62% of total peak area in sage, bay laurel, and rosemary essential oils, respectively (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04818-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Sesquiterpenes were also well represented: up to 35%, 17%, and 56% of total peak area in sage, bay laurel, and rosemary essential oils, respectively. Dominant compounds (i.e., terpenes represented with more than 5% of total peak area) were confirmed by NMR (as described and represented in Supplementary file 1,
