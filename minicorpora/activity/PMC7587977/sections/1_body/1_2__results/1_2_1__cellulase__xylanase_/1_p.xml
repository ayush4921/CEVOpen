<p>Before applying cell wall-degrading enzymes (xylanase, pectinase, and cellulase) for the extraction of bioactive compounds from the plant material, their activity under the extraction conditions (1 h, 40 °C, in MiliQ water) was measured at a small scale by 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNSA) assay. The enzymes were mixed with their appropriate polymeric substrates in the MiliQ water and the reaction was incubated for 1 h at 40 °C. The results have shown that all enzymes were able to degrade their substrates: xylanase degraded xylan to 1.10 U/mL, pectinase pectin to 0.03 U/mL, and cellulase cellulose to 0.05 U/mL.</p>
