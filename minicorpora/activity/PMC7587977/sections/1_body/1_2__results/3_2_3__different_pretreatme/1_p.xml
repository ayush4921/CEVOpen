<p>All tested hydrodistillation pretreatments caused an increase in essential oil yield when compared to no-pretreatment control (HD): 56–64% for bay laurel, 40–60% for rosemary, and 45–55% for sage (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04818-f001">Figure 1</xref>). However, only slight differences in essential oil yield were observed between different pretreatments for the same plant species. Importantly, none of the individual (HD-REX, HD-REC, HD-REP) or combined (HD-REPCX) enzymatic pretreatments significantly outperformed reflux extraction pretreatment (HD-RE). Since HD-RE served as a no-enzyme control, this indicates that enzymatic activity had only a minute effect on essential oil yield increase and that it should be mostly attributed to reflux extraction
