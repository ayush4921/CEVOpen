<p>Fresh leaves were collected from wild plants of rosemary (
 <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> L.), sage (
 <italic>Salvia officinalis</italic> L.), and bay laurel (
 <italic>Laurus nobilis</italic> L.) in the south Mediterranean region of Croatia in August 2018. The leaves were air-dried at room temperature (20 ± 2 °C) for one week. Dry leaves were packed in polyethylene bags and kept in a dark, dry, and cool place. Before being used for the extractions, the plant material was milled using a house blender (Tefal).
