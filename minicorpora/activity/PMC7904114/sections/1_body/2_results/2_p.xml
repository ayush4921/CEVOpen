 <bold>Antibacterial effect of essential oils. </bold>The results of the antibacterial effect of the essential oils and sodium benzoate on methicillin-resistant
 <italic> S. aureus </italic>and 
 <italic>Y. enterocolitica </italic>by disk diffusion method are shown based on the diameter of inhibition zone (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The results of the broth microdilution test as means and SD of MIC and MBC of the essential oils individually and combined with sodium benzoate are expressed in 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Tables 3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">4</xref> respectively. Statistical analysis by analysis of variance showed a significant difference between different antibacterial effects of essential oils individually and combined with sodium benzoate. Antibacterial effect of 
 <italic>Mentha longifolia </italic>essential oil against methicillin-resistant
 <italic> S. aureus</italic> was the highest and then
 <italic> Cuminum cyminum</italic> and
 <italic> Mentha spicata</italic> essential oils and sodium benzoate indicated antibacterial activity. These data were completely consistent with the disk diffusion test. Also, the combined effect of sodium benzoate with 
 <italic>M. longifolia</italic> essential oil was the strongest against methicillin-resistant
 <italic> S. aureus</italic>. The effects of sodium benzoate combined with the essential oils on
 <italic> S. aureus </italic>showed significant differences with sodium benzoate effect individually (
 <italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.05). Antibacterial effect of
 <italic> C. cyminum </italic>essential oil on 
 <italic>Y. </italic>
 <italic>enterocolitica</italic> was the highest and then
 <italic> M. longifolia</italic>,
 <italic> M. spicata </italic>and sodium benzoate indicated antibacterial activity. Antibacterial effect of 
 <italic>C. cyminum </italic>essential oil was consistent with the disk diffusion test. Data inconsistency about other factors might be due to less precision of the disk diffusion test. On the other hand, sodium benzoate placed on the disk was obtained from MIC dilution, however, the oils were placed directly. The combined effect of sodium benzoate with essential oils on
 <italic> Y. enterocolitica</italic> showed significant differences than it's an individual effect (
 <italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.05). The effect of sodium benzoate combined with 
 <italic>M. longifolia</italic> was the highest against 
 <italic>Y. enterocolitica</italic>, indicating that the combined effect might be different from the individual effect of essential oils. Data analysis of two bacteria using independent sample 
 <italic>t</italic>-test showed that 
 <italic>Y. enterocolitica</italic> was more susceptible to 
 <italic>C. cyminum</italic> essential oil, sodium benzoate, and sodium benzoate combined with 
 <italic>M. longifolia</italic> and 
 <italic>M. spicata</italic> rather than 
 <italic>S. </italic>aureus (
 <italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.05). However, there was no significant difference between the two bacteria in effects of 
 <italic>M. longifolia</italic>, 
 <italic>M. spicata,</italic> and sodium benzoate combined with 
 <italic>C. cyminum</italic> essential oil (
 <italic>p </italic>&gt; 0.05). The MBC results of sodium benzoate individually and combined with 
 <italic>M. longifolia</italic> did not confirm any bactericidal effect against methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>.
