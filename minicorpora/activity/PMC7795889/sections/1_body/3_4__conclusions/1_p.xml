<p>To our knowledge, the chemical composition, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and enzyme inhibitory activities of the essential oil from 
 <italic>R. beesianus</italic> rhizome were reported for the first time. Thirty-five chemical constituents were identified and quantified with GC-FID/MS. In addition to the weak inhibitory effect of EO on tyrosinase and BChE, the 
 <italic>R. beesianus</italic> EO showed significant antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic>, 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>Proteus vulgaris</italic>. Moreover, EO significantly inhibited the production of proinflammatory mediators (NO) and cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells without any cytotoxic effect. Furthermore, EO revealed a moderate 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase inhibition effect and significant AChE inhibitory activity. Thus, the 
 <italic>R. beesianus</italic> EO could be regarded as a source of bioactive products with high exploitation potential in the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries.
