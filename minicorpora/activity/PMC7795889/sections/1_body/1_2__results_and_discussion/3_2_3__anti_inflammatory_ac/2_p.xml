<p>The proinflammatory mediator (NO) and cytokines (TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> and IL-6) play key roles in the development of the inflammation process, and compounds that inhibit their overproduction may be good candidates in the treatment of many inflammation-related diseases [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-26-00167" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. According to the previous studies, the 1,8-cineole, as the most predominant constituent in 
 <italic>R. beesianus</italic> EO, reduced LPS-induced inflammation by inhibiting TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> and IL-6 [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-26-00167" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The anti-inflammatory properties of other main components in EO, such as borneol, methyleugenol, 
 <italic>α</italic>-terpineol, and 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene, have been demonstrated in the previous reports [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-26-00167" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-26-00167" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-26-00167" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-26-00167" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Therefore, these main components could explain the significant anti-inflammatory effect of the 
 <italic>R. beesianus</italic> EO. These results suggest that the 
 <italic>R. beesianus</italic> EO can be used as a new source of natural anti-inflammatory molecules in the cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries.
