<p>Murine macrophages RAW264.7 and murine fibroblast cells L929 were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere in Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (DMEM) and Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium, respectively. Both media were supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin. The cytotoxic activity was determined by the MTT assay with slight modification [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-26-00167" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The cell suspensions (100 μL) were added to each well at the density of 2 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells per well and incubated for 24 h. Subsequently, 100 μL of the diluted EO solution was added and cultured for 24 h. Then, the MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) solution (10 μL, 5 mg/mL in PBS) was added. After 4 h of incubation, the supernate was discarded and 150 μL of DMSO was added to each well to dissolve formazan crystal. The absorbance was measured using a Varioskan Lux Multimode microplate reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) at 490 nm to evaluate the cell viability and proliferation inhibitory ratio.
