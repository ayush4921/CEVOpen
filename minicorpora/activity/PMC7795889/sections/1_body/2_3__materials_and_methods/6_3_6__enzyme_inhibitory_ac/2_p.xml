<p>The inhibitory activity of tyrosinase was evaluated according to the method with L-tyrosine as a substrate [
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-26-00167" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. EO solution (70 μL) and tyrosinase solution (100 μL, 100 U/mL) were mixed and added to each well. After 5 min incubation at 37 °C, 80 μL of L-tyrosine solution (5.5 mM) was added and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Then, the absorbance was recorded at 492 nm and arbutin was used as a positive control. The tyrosinase inhibitory activity was expressed using IC
 <sub>50</sub> values.
