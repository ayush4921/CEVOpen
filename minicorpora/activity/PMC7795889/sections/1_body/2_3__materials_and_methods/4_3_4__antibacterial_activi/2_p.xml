<p>The diameter of the inhibition zone (DIZ) was assayed according to our previously published disc agar diffusion method [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-26-00167" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Briefly, The EO was dissolved with ethyl acetate (100 mg/mL). Streptomycin distilled water solution (100 μg/mL) was used as a positive control. The bacterial suspension (100 μL, 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU/mL) was evenly spread on the Mueller–Hinton agar medium. The filter paper discs (diameter 6 mm) containing EO or streptomycin solution (20 μL) were added and the diameter of inhibition zone (DIZ) was recorded after 24 h incubation at 37 °C.
