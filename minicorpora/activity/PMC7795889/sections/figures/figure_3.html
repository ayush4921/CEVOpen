 <caption> Effects of R. beesianus rhizome EO on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced morphology (200×) ( A), nitric oxide (NO) production ( B), and secretion of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF- α) ( C) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) ( D) in RAW264.7 macrophages. ( A) The RAW 264.7 macrophages were exposed to different EO concentrations and in the presence or absence of LPS (1 μg/mL). After 24 h of incubation, the images of RAW 264.7 cells were taken. ( B) The RAW 264.7 cells were exposed to different EO concentrations and stimulated with LPS. Dexamethasone (DXM, 20 μg/mL) was used as a positive control. The accumulation of NO in the culture supernatants was assayed by the Griess reaction. ( C, D) The RAW 264.7 cells were exposed to different EO concentrations and stimulated with LPS. The amount of TNF- α ( C) and IL-6 ( D) was determined using respective ELISA determination kits. The experiments were performed independently at least three times, and the data were expressed as the mean ± SD values. The different letters above bars indicate a significant difference ( p &lt; 0.05). </caption>
