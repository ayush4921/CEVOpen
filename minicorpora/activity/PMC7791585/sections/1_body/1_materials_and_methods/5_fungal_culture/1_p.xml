<p>Subsequently, from the result of the extraction of the essential oil, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% dilutions were prepared, placed in different bottles and properly labeled. The sowings were carried out in Saboraud dextrose agar for the cultivation of fungi (yeasts and dermatophytes). Once the cultures were done, they were stored in the incubator at 37Â°C for a period of 24 hours. After having achieved the growth of bacterial colonies, sensitivity tests were carried out. The petri dishes were conditioned with the Mueller Hinton agar, in which each plate was seeded with 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> ATCC 10231. Next, five wells were made in each petri dish: four wells for the four concentrations of the EOC and the last one for the nystatin. Finally, the inhibition halos were measured with a Mitutoyo calibrator, at 24- and 48-h intervals.
