<p>When contrasting the results of this research with the literature, it was evident that there are studies that explored the properties of the EOC against different microorganisms associated with infections.[

 <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] For example, in the trial of Farisa Banu 
 <italic>et al.</italic>,[
 <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] they evaluated the growth curve for 
 <italic>Candida</italic> spp. and thus corroborated the antifungal efficacy, and found that there was a significant reduction in fungus growth after 24h of incubation. Similarly, Shahina 
 <italic>et al.</italic>[
 <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] showed that cinnamon bark extract (
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic>) had inhibitory activity against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, although more studies are needed to understand this phenomenon. This is probably due to the fact that the essential oil used in that investigation was composed of terpenoids, phenols, and aldehydes, which could suggest that essential oils can serve as new antifungal substances to fight resistant germs.
