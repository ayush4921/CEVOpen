<p>In this research, it was decided to use nystatin as positive control group because it’s one of the medications more prescribed due their great scientific support, for this reason for comparative purposes with our results, also used in this medicine as a control group. The main limitation of this research was that only antifungal efficacy was shown against one strain and against a single positive control group; however, it is important to compare the efficacy of this natural resource against other antifungals. Another limitation was that only the antifungal efficacy of cinnamon was evaluated, and it was not verified whether there is a synergism with other Peruvian natural resources[

 <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] that can also be easily obtained in the national territory. However, despite all these limitations, this study was performed successfully. Finally, it is recommended to conduct studies with other antifungal medications, to contrast the behavior when compared with the EOC. In addition, the EOC should be assessed against other fungal strains resistant to traditional medicines. Finally, “

 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic> (cinnamon) can provide and to check if the “
