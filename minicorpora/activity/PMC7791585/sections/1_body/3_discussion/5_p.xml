<p>According to Wang 
 <italic>et al.</italic>,[
 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] who investigated the antifungal mechanisms and healing effects of the cinnamon oil and pogostemon oil complexes toward intestinal infections by Candida, the average MIC values of the fungal complexes were found to be 0.064mg/mL (cinnamon oil), 0.032mg/mL (pogostemon oil) for 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>; therefore, it was concluded that the cinnamon oils and pogostemon oil had strong antifungal effects against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, 
 <italic>C. tropicalis</italic>, and 
 <italic>Candida krusei</italic>, and they impacted the morphology and sub-microstructures of the fungus at 48â€“72h, and finally denatured and killed the cells. As a result of this investigation, they observed that the aqueous cinnamon extract had no antifungal effect, whereas the EOC had positive results on 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>. These results together with that of other studies[

 <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
 <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] are consistent with our research, because the essential oil of 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic> (Canela) obtained a greater antifungal effectiveness, forming a greater halo of inhibition compared with nystatin in the 24-h period.
