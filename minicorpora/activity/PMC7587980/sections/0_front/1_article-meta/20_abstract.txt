0: Tangerine (  Citrus tangerina) is one of the most important crops of Thailand with a total harvest that exceeds 100,000 tons.
1: Citrus essential oils are widely used as aromatherapy and medicinal agents.
2: The effect of tangerine essential oil on human brain waves and sleep activity has not been reported.
3: In the present study, we therefore evaluated these effects of tangerine essential oil by measurement of electroencephalography (EEG) activity with 32 channel platforms according to the international 1020 system in 10 male and 10 female subjects.
4: Then the sleep onset latency was studied to further confirm the effect on sleep activity.
5: The results revealed that different concentrations, subthreshold to suprathreshold, of tangerine oil gave different brain responses.
6: Undiluted tangerine oil inhalation reduced slow and fast alpha wave powers and elevated low and mid beta wave powers.
7: The subthreshold and threshold dilution showed the opposite effect to the brain compared with suprathreshold concentration.
8: Inhalation of threshold concentration showed effectively decreased alpha and beta wave powers and increased theta wave power, which emphasize its sedative effect.
9: The reduction of sleep onset latency was confirmed with the implementation of the observed sedative effect of tangerine oil.
