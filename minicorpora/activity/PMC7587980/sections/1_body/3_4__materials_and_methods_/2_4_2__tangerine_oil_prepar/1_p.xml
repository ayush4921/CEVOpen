<p>The Tangerine oil extracted using steam distillation was obtained from Thai China Flavours &amp; Fragrances Co., Ltd.(Bangkok, Thailand). The tangerine oil was analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy (GC–MS) (Agilent 5977A, Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) using two VF-WAXms columns (30 m × 250 µm, film thickness 0.25 μm). The oven temperature was programmed at 35–200 °C (10 °C/min), 200 °C (5 min), 200–250 °C (4 °C/min), and 250 °C (10 min); injector temperature: 250 °C; carrier gas: helium: splitting ratio 500:1; injection volume: 1 μL; interface temperature: 250 °C; MS source temperature: 230 °C; and MS quadrupole temperature: 150 °C. The compounds were identified by their retention indices and their mass spectra. The components of the oil were identified by comparison of their mass spectra fragmentation and computer matching using the Wiley 10 and NIST 14 libraries (Database/ChemStation data system). Fifty microliters of essential oil were spotted on a filter paper and the filter paper was attached to the subject’s nose at approximately 3-cm distance for analysis of the effects of tangerine essential oil inhalation on brain waves and mood responses compared to baseline (without essential oil) as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04865-f009">Figure 9</xref>. To illustrate concentration effect, different concentrations of tangerine oil including undiluted concentration, 1:1000 dilution, and 1:8000 dilution, which represent suprathreshold, threshold, and subthreshold, respectively, were used for experiment. To evaluate the effect of essential oil on sleep study, 25 μL of essential oil that contains a tangerine essential oil concentration of 1:1000 dilution was spotted on a filter paper and two sets of this filter paper were inserted into the pillow case of the subject.
