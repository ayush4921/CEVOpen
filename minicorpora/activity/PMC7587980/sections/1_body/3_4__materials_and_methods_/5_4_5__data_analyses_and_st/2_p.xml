<p>Data analysis for EEG: raw data were processed by power spectral analysis, and frequency domain data are characterized as slow alpha (8–11 Hz), fast alpha (11–13 Hz), low beta (13–15 Hz), mid beta (15–20 Hz), and high beta (20–30 Hz). This describes the distribution of electrical activity across the brain regions and was produced to show overview activities using GraphPad Prism 8.</p>
