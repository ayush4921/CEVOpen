<p>We tested subthreshold and threshold dilutions of tangerine oil in female subject because of a sensitivity issue. Subthreshold and threshold were examined by two dilution tests that are 1:8000 and 1:1000 dilutions, respectively. Interestingly, subthreshold and threshold dilutions caused different brain responses compared with suprathreshold concentration (undiluted concentration). The result showed slightly increased theta wave power and slightly decreased alpha wave power. No beta wave power reduction was observed during 1:8000 dilution inhalation. It revealed more reduction of alpha and beta wave powers and an increase of theta wave power in 1:1000 dilution (

The subthreshold and threshold dilution showed opposite effects on the brain compared with suprathreshold concentration, which emphasizes the sedative effect of the oil on these levels. Tangerine oil was then further tested for sleep onset latency. The result showed that the oil with 1:1000 dilution significantly reduced sleep onset latency in female subjects compared with baseline sleep onset latency (
