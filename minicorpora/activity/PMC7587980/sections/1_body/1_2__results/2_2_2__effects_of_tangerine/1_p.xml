<p>To analyze the brain activities of each dedicated region, we divided recording electrodes into four regions according to the responsible cortex underneath the skull. It consists of a frontal region, centro-temporal region, parietal region, and occipital region. Single channel analysis suggested that the tangerine oil can produce a significant change in three different electrode sites. To specifically study activities that contributed from each brain region, we defined each responsible electrode group for each brain region. The frontal region is composed of Fp1, Fp2, AF3, AF4, F7, F3, FZ, F4, FC5, FC1, FC2, and FC6, which record cortical activity in the frontal area of the brain. Centro-temporal region is composed of T7, C3, CZ, C4, T8, CP5, CP1, CP2, and CP6, which are responsible for virtually the middle and temporal area. The parietal region is composed of P7, P3, PZ, P4, and P8, which are responsible for parietal region. Finally, the occipital region is composed of PO7, PO3, OZ, PO4, and PO8, which are responsible for the occipital region. There was an increase of slow alpha wave power in the frontal region and a decrease of slow alpha wave power in centro-temporal, parietal, and occipital regions in mixed gender (

In female subjects, the result showed a reduction of brain wave power in centro-temporal and parietal regions. For fast alpha wave power, the result showed a reduction of brain wave power in the frontal region in mixed gender and showed both a reduction of brain wave power in both genders in the frontal region (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04865-f005">Figure 5</xref>). Only female subjects showed increases of this brain wave power in frontal, centro-temporal, and parietal regions. For mid beta wave power, it showed an increase of brain wave power in the frontal region and only in female subjects was an increase in frontal region observed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04865-f006">Figure 6</xref>). For high beta wave power, the result showed an increase of brain wave power in the centro-temporal region, which was observed in male subjects. This brain wave power was observed as an increase in occipital region in female subjects (
