<p>The determination of fumigation effect was based on the protocol of 
 <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al. (2005)</xref> with some modifications. The fumigation experiments of adults and eggs in this study were performed in 296-ml conical flasks with stoppers. A filter paper strip (3 × 1.5 cm
 <sup>2</sup>) was used as a diffusion carrier for the fumigant and was suspended in the center of the container with a thread. In the fumigation experiments with adult 
 <italic>P. operculella</italic>, the filter paper strip was sandwiched between fine gauze mesh to prevent direct contact with adult 
 <italic>P. operculella</italic>. Based on pretest results, the sample compounds were dissolved and prepared as stock solutions, followed by serial dilution to 5–6 concentrations. A micro-syringe was used to draw 25 µl of the compound solution and drop this on the filter paper strip. Solvent only was added dropwise as a control, followed by volatilization at room temperature for 60 s. The flask openings were tightly closed and sealed with parafilm. The fumigation conditions were 28 ± 0.5°C and 50–70% RH.
