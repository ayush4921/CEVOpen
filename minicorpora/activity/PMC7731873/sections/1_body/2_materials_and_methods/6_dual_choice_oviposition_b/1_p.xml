<p>This study referred to the methods of oviposition bioassay described by 
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Anfore et al. (2014)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al. (2016)</xref> with some modifications. Healthy potatoes (90 ± 10 g each) of similar size were used for the experiment. The sample compounds were formulated into a series of concentrations (0.2, 1, and 5 mg/ml), and then 200 μl of each of the solutions was applied to filter paper and volatilized at room temperature for 5 min. Each filter paper was placed into a glass bottle (6 × 10 cm) containing a potato. The bottle opening was then covered with double gauze, which as the oviposition site of 
 <italic>P. operculella</italic>. The bottle was tightly covered with a plastic cover (the top surface of the cover, 0.5 cm along the edge, was removed in advance to expose the gauze and allow the scent of the corresponding compound in the bottle to volatilize through the gauze and to fix the gauze as well). Filter paper with solvent only was placed in another glass bottle containing a potato as a control. The excess gauze outside the bottle cover was removed, and the bottle opening was further sealed with parafilm. Two glass flasks were placed diagonally in a rectangular container (dimension: 36 × 28 × 14 cm
 <sup>3</sup>), followed by released eight pairs of mated adult 
 <italic>P. operculella</italic> (1-d-old), feeding them with water containing 10% honey, and covering the container with nylon gauze (24-mesh). The container was placed in a dark room (26 ± 1°C and 50–70% RH). The number of eggs oviposited on the gauze was counted under a microscope on the third day of the test to calculate the selective oviposition deterrent index (ODI). Each treatment was repeated five times.
