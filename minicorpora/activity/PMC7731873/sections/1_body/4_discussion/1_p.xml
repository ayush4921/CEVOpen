<p>ARR has a strong aroma, and its volatile oil content is ≥2% (
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">CPC 2020</xref>). The components in the volatile oil are complex. 
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Du et al. (2011)</xref> isolated 52 components from the volatile oil of ARR. 
 <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. (2018)</xref> analyzed the main components of the volatile oil of ARR and showed that phenylpropenes (54.21%) and monoterpenes (24.02%) were the main components. Among the volatiles, the levels of methyleugenol, safrole, and 3,5-dimethoxytoluene were the highest. Methyl eugenol and safrole belong to the phenylpropenes. ARR has a long history of medicinal use, and its volatile oil is the main active ingredient. ARR has toxic to humans, so its dosage should be limited in clinical practice to no more than 1–3 g/d (
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">CPC 2020</xref>). The toxicity of ARR mainly comes from the safrole in its volatile oil. Safrole is carcinogenic (
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Ping et al. 2012</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. 2018</xref>). Although safrole is a component with strong insecticidal and acaricidal activities in the essential oil of ARR, its mammalian toxicity may limit its further development and application.
