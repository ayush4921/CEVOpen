0: AbstractPhthorimaea operculella (Zeller) is a worldwide pest of potato.
1: Plant-borne chemicals would be potential alternatives of synthetic chemical fumigants against   P. operculella in the storage.
2: Asari Radix et Rhizoma is derived from the dry roots and rhizomes of   Asarum heterotropoides Fr.
3: Schmidt var.
4: mandshuricum,   A. sieboldii Miq.
5: var.
6: seoulense, or   A. sieboldii.
7: In this study, fumigant toxicity and oviposition deterrent of volatile constituents from ARR, -3-carene, -terpinene, terpinolene, eucarvone, 3,5-dimethoxytoluene, and methyleugenol were tested against   P. operculella.
8: The preliminary verification of preventive and control effects of eucarvone, 3,5-dimethoxytoluene and methyleugenol on   P. operculella was carried out by simulating warehouse experiments.
9: The results indicated that the six compounds above had fumigation toxic effects on the adults and eggs of   P. operculella.
10: Among them, -3-carene, -terpinene, and terpinolene had weaker fumigation effects than those of eucarvone, 3,5-dimethoxytoluene, and methyleugenol.
11: The LC  50 values of eucarvone, 3,5-dimethoxytoluene, and methyleugenol against adult   P. operculella were 1.01, 1.78, 1.51 mg/liter air, respectively.
12: The LC  50 values against egg   P. operculella were 1.09, 0.55, 0.30 mg/liter air, respectively.
13: The oviposition deterrent experiment showed that only methyleugenol (at 5 and 1 mg/ml) and eucarvone (5 mg/ml) had a substantial oviposition deterrent effect.
14: The simulated warehouse experiment verified that methyleugenol, eucarvone, and 3,5-dimethoxytoluene protected potatoes from   P. operculella and demonstrated that methyleugenol had the best preventive and control effects.
15: It was concluded that methyleugenol was the active ingredient with the most potential in the volatiles from ARR on   P. operculella control and merit further study as botanic fumigant.
