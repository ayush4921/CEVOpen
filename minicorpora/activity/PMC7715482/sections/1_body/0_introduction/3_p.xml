<p id="p0010">Chemically, when the process of deacetylation process, the weaker hydrogen bonds of chitin are linked with N-acetyl glucosamine chins and formed as a chitosan, which possesses positively charged amino groups when it diluted in acidic solvent (

 <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">Rajivgandhi et al., 2019b</xref>). Chitosan is formed with the help of negatively charged crosslinking agents in the natural polymers moieties of itself through intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds (

 <xref rid="b0195" ref-type="bibr">Topuz and Uyar, 2020</xref>). The universal crosslinking agent is sodium tripolyphosphate (TPP), which is used in nanoencapsulation, even formed capsules are labile in the aqueous system based on the pH and ionic strength (
 <xref rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr">Rajkumar et al., 2020</xref>). Basically, it shows on rod-like, crystal structures with larger surface area and hold the negatively charged sulphate groups on the cellulose backbone due to the process of hydrolysis. It can be formed as polymeric matrix with the mechanical behavior. Previously, this process is increased the rigid film matrix without stable condition for improved antimicrobial and mechanical properties (
