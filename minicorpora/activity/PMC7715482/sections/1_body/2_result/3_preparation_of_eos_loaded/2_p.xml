 <xref rid="b0170" ref-type="bibr">Salehi et al., 2020</xref>), it is a two way process, the formation of chitosan loaded essential oils was emulsified using ionic gelation between the chitosan and cross linker of TPP by electrostatic interaction. In our study, we have used TPP as a cross linker in the ionic gelation of chitosan to essential oils. Previously, more researchers

 <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">López-Meneses et al., 2018a</xref>, were reported that the chitosan loaded essential oil method is one of the best method for drug delivery due to the amide linkage between carboxylic group of plant essential oil and primary amino groups of chitosan without leaving a spacer molecules. In the present study, we have formulated the Guva leaves mediated essential oils with chitosan and form a cage like structure due to the self-association of hydrophobic segment of Guva essential oil inside and outside of chitosan with hydrophilic segment (

 <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">López-Meneses et al., 2018b</xref>). In our study, we have used sonicator for chitosan plus essential oil mixer. The maximum encapsulation efficiency and loading capacity have been detected for 1: 1 ratio of chitosan and guva essential oils. Therefore, our result was initially confirmed that the essential oil was successfully loaded into the chitosan polymer. The confirmation of this nanogel formation was identified by FT-IR analysis.
