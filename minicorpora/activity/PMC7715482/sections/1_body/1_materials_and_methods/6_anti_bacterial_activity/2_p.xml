After complete solidification, 5 mm gap between the wells were made aseptically using sterile gel borer, which had been previously swabbed with 24 h old 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> culture. Then, various concentration of chitosan loaded essential oil was added into the cutted wells and maintained at room temperature 1 day. After incubation, the plates were taken and observed the diameter zones of the wells. The inhibition zone of the wells were measured in diameter and noted.
