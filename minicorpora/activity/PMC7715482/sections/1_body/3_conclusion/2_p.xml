<p id="p0095">Based on our study result, we have confirmed that the essential oils were successfully loaded into the chitosan surface and it confirmed by comparison of chitosan alone result. The confirmation of chitosan loaded essential oils was showed by transferred chemical groups of FT-IR. In addition, the rough surface morphology of chitosan loaded essential oil was confirmed that the oils were present inside of the chitosan. Further, the anti-bacterial activity of the chitosan loaded essential oil was found at excellent activity against selected multi drug resistant 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>. Furthermore, the minimum inhibition concentration study result was confirmed that the chitosan loaded essential oils was inhibited the 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> at very lowest concentration (100 µg/mL). Finally, we have concluded that the present findings were confirmed that the chitosan loaded essential oil has increased anti-bacterial activity against 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>.
