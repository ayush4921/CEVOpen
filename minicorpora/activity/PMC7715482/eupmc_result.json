    "The development of antibiotic resistant in <i>K. pneumoniae</i> is an emerging thread worldwide due to the poor antimicrobial drugs. To overcome this issue, researchers are focused on plant material and their essential oils to fight against multi drug resistant bacteria. In this context, the current study was concentrated in medicinal plant of guva leaves and their essential oils to combat multi drug resistant bacterial infections. The essential oils were successfully screened and confirmed by HRLC-MS analysis. The anti-bacterial ability of the compounds were loaded into the chitosan nanoparticles and proved by FT-IR analysis. In addition, the chitosan loaded essential oils morphology was compared with chitosan alone in SEM analysis and suggested that the material was loaded successfully. Further, the anti-bacterial ability of the chitosan loaded essential oils were primarily confirmed by agar well diffusion method. At the 100 µg/mL of lowest concentration of chitosan loaded essential oils, the multi-drug resistant <i>K. pneumoniae</i> was inhibited with 96% and confirmed by minimum inhibition concentration experiment. Hence, all the experiments were proved that the essential oils were successfully loaded into the chitosan nanoparticles, and it has more anti-bacterial activity against multi-drug resistant <i>K. pneumoniae.</i>"
