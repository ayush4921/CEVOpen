<p>The bioactivities of the oxygenated monoterpenes, known in PREO, have been demonstrated in various surveys [
 <xref rid="pone.0246470.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pone.0246470.ref092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. In our work, all the major components of PREO displayed the larvicidal activity; however, the highest larvicidal activity was related to citronellol and the least to linalool. In line with our results, former investigations have already been evidenced that both citronellol and geraniol are more toxic to

 <italic>pipiens</italic> and 
 <italic>Pediculus humanus capitis</italic> than linalool [

 <xref rid="pone.0246470.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Lipophilic citronellol can disrupt the membrane integrity by inducing free radical generation [

 <xref rid="pone.0246470.ref094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. Likewise, geraniol can restore susceptibility to drugs in numerous Gram-negative bacteria by targeting efflux pumps [
