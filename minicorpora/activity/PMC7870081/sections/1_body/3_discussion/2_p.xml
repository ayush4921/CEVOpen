 <italic>An</italic>. 
 <italic>stephensi</italic>. These findings are significant from two perspectives; first, the larvicidal activity of pure PREO is acceptable in comparison with the temephos, and second, the susceptibility of the two forms of 
 <italic>An</italic>. 
 <italic>stephensi</italic>, mysorensis and intermediate, was found to differ in terms of exposure to the oil. In this study, the PREO, even its major components, was more effective against
