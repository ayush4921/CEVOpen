<p>Herbal EOs, as green pesticides, have practically displayed insecticidal, fumigant, antifeedant, attractive, repellent, and growth-reducing effects on various arthropod pests, including insects of medical and veterinary significance [

 <xref rid="pone.0246470.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Botanical pesticides made from EOs exploit the toxicity of aromatic hydrocarbons included in the oils [
 <xref rid="pone.0246470.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. This is an important advantage because these bioinsecticides affect only the target insects, do not damage beneficial natural enemies and provide residue-free food and safe environment [
 <xref rid="pone.0246470.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. As concluded in the literature, most of the EOs and their active substances are nontoxic to mammals. In general, their LD
 <sub>50</sub> for rats have been reported to be 800–3,000 mg kg
 <sup>-1</sup> for raw compounds and ≥5,000 mg kg
 <sup>-1</sup> for formulated insecticides [
 <xref rid="pone.0246470.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Thence most EOs and their active constituents can be used without toxicological and ecotoxicological studies [
