<p>The contributions of insect gut microbiota in the susceptibility and resistance to antimicrobials have recently been the focus of researchers [

 <xref rid="pone.0246470.ref105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. The function of gut bacteria against toxins can be protective or synergistic. Basically, insect gut bacteria are resistant to antimicrobials and to toxic ingredients of the food, or at least actively participate in detoxifying such compounds [
 <xref rid="pone.0246470.ref106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. In this context, the antibacterial effects of PREO and its optimized nanoemulsions were investigated on representative gut bacteria of two BFs of

Surprisingly, in the treatments with both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, all the PREO-based formulations uncovered a better inhibitory effect than temephos. This behavior may reflect the interaction of the bacteria under study, which encourages future studies to consider the sensitivity or resistance of the whole microbial community in the evaluation of antimicrobials. It should also be clarified in future investigations whether the antibacterial consequence of PREO inhibits the bacterial growth (bacteriostatic) or destroys bacterial cells (bactericidal), as well as determines the mechanisms underlying such actions.
