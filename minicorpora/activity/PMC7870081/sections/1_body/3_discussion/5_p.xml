<p>Owing to their volatility, EOs have an easier degradation and cause less spread of environmental pollution. However, their solubility and stability problems need to be resolved in some ways, for example through the development of nanoformulations [
 <xref rid="pone.0246470.ref096" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. Accordingly, we developed 16 O/W nanoemulsions. Compared to the crude PREO, the overall larvicidal activity of all nanoformulations was boosted by 20% and the optimized formulations by 50% (

Although there were no significant changes in the physical characteristics of the formulations kept for up to 40 days, future studies may examine their bioactivities, which were not the purpose of this study.
