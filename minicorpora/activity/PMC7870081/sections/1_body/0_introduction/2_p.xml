<p>A number of ~40 species of 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> are recognized as the dominant vectors of malaria [
 <xref rid="pone.0246470.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Among these species, 
 <italic>An</italic>. 
 <italic>stephensi</italic>, the Asian malaria mosquito, is widely distributed from the Middle East to the Indian subcontinent and Southeastern Asia [

 <xref rid="pone.0246470.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Based on the egg phenotypes, 
 <italic>An</italic>. 
 <italic>stephensi</italic> has three biological forms (BFs), which type form is known to be anthropophilic and a more competent vector of urban malaria, whereas mysorensis and intermediate forms are regarded as relatively zoophilic and poor vectors in the rural areas [
 <xref rid="pone.0246470.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. All three forms happen in diverse human environments in Iran. In Hormozgan Province, the type and intermediate forms of 
 <italic>An</italic>. 
 <italic>stephensi</italic> are found in urban coastal or suburban/rural plain regions, whereas the mysorensis is observed only in rural mountainous localities. Conversely, in Sistan and Baluchestan Province, only mysorensis form has been reported from different settings and climates [

 <italic>An</italic>. 
 <italic>stephensi</italic> is recognized as a proficient vector for both 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> and 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>vivax</italic>, the agents of clinically severe malaria [
