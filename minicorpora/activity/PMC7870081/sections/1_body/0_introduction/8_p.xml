<p>In spite of its supreme biological potential, the 
 <italic>Pelargonium roseum</italic> essential oil (PREO) remains, to our knowledge, unexplored concerning the development of an innovative nanolarvicide. Therefore, the present study aimed to assess the larvicidal activity of PREO and its components, to prepare various nanoemulsions of PREO, to select optimized formulations in terms of physical and biological properties and to evaluate the interaction of larval gut bacteria with PREO formulations as a mechanism for the attribution of the oil insecticidal activity.
