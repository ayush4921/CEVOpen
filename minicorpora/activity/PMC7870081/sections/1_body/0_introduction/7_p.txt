0: The idea that insects are colonized by numerous microorganisms, particularly bacteria, has widely been acknowledged by life scientists.
1: The external and internal parts of the insect body, especially digestive tract, offer conditions and resources needed to support beneficial microbiota [ 54].
2: Several bacterial symbionts promote host fitness by contributing to nutrition [ 55], reproduction [ 56,  57], speciation [ 58], immunity/defense [ 59 62], ecological communication [ 63], and pathogen transmission ability [ 64].
3: More recent studies have pinpointed that there is a potential linkage between insect gut microbiota and their susceptibility to insecticides [ 65 67]; therefore, the sensitivity of gut bacteria needs to be taken into account prior to any intervention measures.
