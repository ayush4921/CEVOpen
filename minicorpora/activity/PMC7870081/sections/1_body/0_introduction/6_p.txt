0: EOs are a blend of naturally occurring volatile aromatic and aliphatic compounds manufactured in plants as secondary metabolites [ 37,  38].
1: These oils are important in biosciences for their antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, antiparasitic, anticancer, insecticidal, psychophysiological, neuroprotective and anti-aging activities [ 38].
2: The reason why EOs are effective against a broad variety of pathogens is attributed to the existence of different chemical families of alcohols, ethers or oxides, aldehydes, ketones, esters, amines, amides, phenols, heterocycles, and chiefly the terpenes [ 39].
3: In recent years, nanoemulsion-based delivery systems have been the focus of many studies.
4: Thanks to their subcellular size, nanocarriers have potential to boost the bioactivity of EOs since they allow a wide tissue penetration and an effortless cellular uptake.
5: Additionally, they render possible to adjust the release of active ingredients at the target site.
6: The nanoemulsion-based delivery systems have been proposed to ameliorate the EOs physico-chemical properties by decreasing their volatility, improving the stability, and enhancing water solubility, as well as by protecting them from the interaction with the environment [ 40,  41].
7: These formulations may correspondingly enhance other characteristics, namely phytotoxicity (when applied on vegetation [ 42]) and spraying improvements (i.e.
8: fog treatments [ 43]).
9: Nanoemulsion of different plant EOs has hitherto been prepared, and their mosquito larvicidal properties have been investigated [ 44 53].
