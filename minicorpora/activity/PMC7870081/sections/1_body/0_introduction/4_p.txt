0: Targeting mosquito vectors to interrupt the circulation of pathogens has always been a basic control strategy against major mosquito-borne diseases [ 15].
1: Early mosquito control policies were principally relied on the larval source management, through larviciding and biological control agents, together with environmental modifications [ 16,  17].
2: In the early 1940s, the chemical era of vector control was launched with organochlorine DDT usage, both as larvicide and adulticide [ 18].
3: Over the time, two groups of organophosphates and carbamates, potent cholinesterase inhibitors, were largely replaced by organochlorines [ 19,  20].
4: In the 1980s, synthetic pyrethroids compounds were added to the arsenal of public health insecticides [ 21].
5: As modern insecticides, these compounds are broadly recommended for in-home insect control, as well as for the treatment of mosquito nets and other materials [ 22,  23].
