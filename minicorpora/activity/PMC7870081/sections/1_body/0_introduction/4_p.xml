<p>Targeting mosquito vectors to interrupt the circulation of pathogens has always been a basic control strategy against major mosquito-borne diseases [
 <xref rid="pone.0246470.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Early mosquito control policies were principally relied on the larval source management, through larviciding and biological control agents, together with environmental modifications [

 <xref rid="pone.0246470.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In the early 1940s, the chemical era of vector control was launched with organochlorine DDT usage, both as larvicide and adulticide [
