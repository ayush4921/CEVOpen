<p>For all treatments, 1 mL of each concentration of the PREO solution was supplemented with 99 mL of the dechlorinated water containing 0.001% TW 20, to make up 100 mL of test solution in a 200-mL glass beaker. A plastic rod was applied to stir the oil-ethanol-water solution for 30 s. Four different beakers, one containing 0.125 mg/L of temephos (13.2 μL in 1mL ETH), one comprising of 1% ETH, one holding of 0.001% TW, and the other including untreated dechlorinated water, were set as control solutions. Batches of ~20 healthy larvae were gently transferred to the beakers by a fine strainer. The bioassay was carried out in a room with the conditions of 24 ± 1°C, 50 ± 5% relative humidity, and 12:12 light and dark photoperiodicity. After 24 h of exposure, larval mortality was observed, and four replicates was used for Probit analysis and LC
 <sub>50/90</sub> calculation. If the mortality in the untreated group was between 5% and 20%, the bioassay was then corrected via Abbott’s formula [
