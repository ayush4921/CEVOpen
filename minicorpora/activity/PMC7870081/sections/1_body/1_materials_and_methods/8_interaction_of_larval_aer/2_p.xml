<p>In each interaction test, 32.650 ml of BHI broth, 330 μl of each PREO dilution (equal volume of the LC
 <sub>50/90</sub> for each biological form as well as their corresponding optimized nanoemulsions), and 20 μl of suspension of each target microorganism (adjusted to 0.5 McFarland standard turbidity corresponding to 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/mL) were mixed together. The interacting mixtures were incubated at 37°C and shaken at 200 rpm for 24 h. The growth of bacteria was quantified by measuring the OD at 600 nm (Eppendorf BioPhotometer plus, Germany) at different time points, i.e. 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours post interaction (hpi). Experiments were performed in triplicate. Four culture media, comprising of one medium without any additives and two media containing TW and ETH (as negative controls), and a medium including only the desired bacterium (as positive control), were used for the clarification of the interaction results. The percentage inhibition of the growth of bacteria exposed to treatments during 24 h was calculated by the formula: % inhibition = |Test OD—Control OD/Control OD| × 100, where the test group OD corresponded to bacteria treated with antimicrobial compound concentrations, and the control group corresponded to the untreated bacteria grown under normal conditions.
