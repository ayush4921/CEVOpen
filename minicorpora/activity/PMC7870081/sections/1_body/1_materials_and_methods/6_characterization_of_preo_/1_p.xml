<p>The larvicidal activity of 16 PREO nanoemulsions (F22-F1632) was investigated against BFs of

 <italic>stephensi</italic>, and the physical properties of the most lethal ones were determined. The oil particle size (PS), polydispersity index (PDI), and zeta-potential (ZP) were measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS) with a Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern, ZEN3600, UK) working at 633 nm at 25°C and equipped with a backscatter detector at 173°. The droplets’ morphology of optimized formulations was also determined by transition electron microscopy (TEM) (RASTAK Lab; Tehran, Iran). The appearance and ZP of the optimum nanoemulsions stored at 4°C were checked after 40 days.
