 <xref rid="pone.0246470.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. SPSS V22.0 software was used for data analysis. Graphs were drawn using GraphPad Prism® v.5.00 (GraphPad Software Inc, San Diego, CA, USA). Mean ± standard deviation (SD) was used to describe quantitative variables. Percentage and frequency were also applied for qualitative variables. The assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variance were tested by Shapiro-Wilks and Brown-Forsythe tests, respectively. The data did not violate these assumptions. The two-tailed Student’s t test was used to comparison of larvicidal activity of optimized nanoformulations with corresponding PREO LC
 <sub>50</sub>. The One-way ANOVA analysis was used to compare the larval mortalities of two BFs exposed to components of PREO, as well as to evaluate growth inhibition of gut bacteria exposed to diverse PREO formulations. If ANOVA test was significant, Tukey’s post-hoc analysis was applied. Significance level was considered less than 0.05.
