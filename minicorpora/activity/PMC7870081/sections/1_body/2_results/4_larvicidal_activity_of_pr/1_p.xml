<p>Sixteen O/W formulations of PREO were freshly prepared, and their larvicidal activity was determined as explained before. Among the formulations, F48 and F44 showed the highest larvicidal effects against 
 <italic>An</italic>. 
 <italic>stephensi mysorensis</italic> and 
 <italic>An</italic>. 
 <italic>stephensi intermediate</italic>, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0246470.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The larvicidal activity of F48 was determined to be 94.44±2.680% in which 400 μL of TW, 800 μL of ETH, and 11.5 μL of PREO were applied. All nanoemulsions used against 
 <italic>An</italic>. 
 <italic>stephensi mysorensis</italic> generated mortality above 60% (values above calculated LC
 <sub>50</sub>). After F48, the second rank of the larvicidal activity was related to F88 with 86.93±1.533% lethality. In case of the 
 <italic>An</italic>. 
 <italic>stephensi intermediate</italic>, the average larvicidal activity of F44 was determined as 88.54±1.303%, followed by F48 with 83.75±0.417% lethality. With the exception of F22 and F24, other formulations accounted for more than 60% mortality of the larvae of 
 <italic>An</italic>. 
 <italic>stephensi intermediate</italic> form.
