<p>After 24 h exposure, the PREO showed potent larvicidal activity against BFs of 
 <italic>An</italic>. 
 <italic>stephensi</italic>. The mortality in the control groups did not exceed 5% in all concentrations; thus, there was no need for corrections. Temephos caused ~90% mortality in both mysorensis and intermediate forms. Mortality of larvae exposed to PREO increased in a dose-dependent manner (
 <xref rid="pone.0246470.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Minimum and maximum larval mortality for both BFs were determined to be at 1.56 ppm and 100 ppm concentrations, respectively (

 <sub>50</sub> and LC
 <sub>90</sub> values against the larvae of 
 <italic>An</italic>. 
 <italic>stephensi mysorensis</italic> were 11.44 and 42.42 ppm, while they were 12.55 and 47.69 ppm for
