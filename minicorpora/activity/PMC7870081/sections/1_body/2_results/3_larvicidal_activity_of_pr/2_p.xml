<p>The four major components identified in PREO showed the larvicidal activity against BFs of 
 <italic>An</italic>. 
 <italic>stephensi</italic>, as well. The statistical analysis of the larval mortality for each component of the PREO is shown individually in the corresponding columns in 
 <xref rid="pone.0246470.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. There were no statistically significant differences in the larval mortality between the PREO components at the dose of 11.44 ppm [F(4,15) = 1.29, P = 0.31]. However, at the concentration of 42.42 ppm, there was a significant difference between the PREO components [F(4,15) = 842.8, P≤0.001]. The results of post hoc tests (Tukey’s test) revealed a significant difference between citronellol, geraniol, and the mixture of four components (P≤0.05) and between the first two mentioned components and L-menthone (P≤0.05) with linalool. There was also a significant difference between the studied components at a dose of 12.55 ppm [F(4,15) = 9.60, P = 0.005], as well. The larvicidal activity of L-menthone and geraniol (P≤0.05), the mixture of four compounds (P≤0.01), and citronellol (P≤0.001) were significantly more than linalool. Statistically significant differences were found in the larval mortality between the components at the dose of 47.69 ppm [F(4,15) = 2227, P≤0.001]. According to Tukey’s results, all components and their mixture showed extremely higher larvicidal activity than linalool (P≤0.001).
