<p>The results of this study approved the larvicidal and antibacterial effects of pure PREO and its nanoformulations on two BFs of 
 <italic>An</italic>. 
 <italic>stephensi</italic> and their intestinal bacteria. Difference between the PREO-based formulations affecting the two BFs may reflect the physiological and even genetic variations in the populations of 
 <italic>An</italic>. 
 <italic>stephensi</italic> studied. The larvicidal activity of PREO-based formulations can ascribed to their antibacterial activity, which calls for further investigation. The susceptibility or resistance of the intestinal bacterial flora may determine the outcomes of the pesticides effects on the target insects. This situation affirms the potential of the bacteria as a major contributor to the survival or inexistence of insects. The formulations developed herein are cost-effective and possibly will have the least damage to humans, environment, and non-target organisms and would be comparable to industrial larvicides, e.g. temephos, if they pass semi-field and field trials successfully.
