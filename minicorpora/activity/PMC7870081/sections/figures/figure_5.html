 <caption> Growth of larval gut bacteria of An. stephensi mysorensis (left) and An. stephensi intermediate (right) in the presence of different concentrations of PREO (LC 50/90) and optimized nanoformulations (F48/F44), as well as temephos. The untreated bacteria species were set as the control group. The absorbance measurement was taken at 600 nm at 2 th, 4 th, 8 th, 12 th, and 24 th time points during incubation at 37Â°C. </caption>
