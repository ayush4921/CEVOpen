0: Anopheles stephensi with three different biotypes is a major vector of malaria in Asia.
1: It breeds in a wide range of habitats.
2: Therefore, safer and more sustainable methods are needed to control its immature stages rather than chemical pesticides.
3: The larvicidal and antibacterial properties of the   Pelargonium roseum essential oil (PREO) formulations were investigated against mysorensis and intermediate forms of   An.
4: stephensi in laboratory conditions.
5: A series of nanoemulsions containing different amounts of PREO, equivalent to the calculated LC  50 values for each   An.
6: stephensi form, and various quantities of surfactants and co-surfactants were developed.
7: The physical and morphological properties of the most lethal formulations were also determined.
8: PREO and its major components, i.e.
9: citronellol (21.34%), L-menthone (6.41%), linalool (4.214%), and geraniol (2.19%), showed potent larvicidal activity against the studied mosquitoes.
10: The LC  50/90 values for mysorensis and intermediate forms were computed as 11.44/42.42 ppm and 12.55/47.69 ppm, respectively.
11: The F48/F44 nanoformulations with 94% and 88% lethality for the mysorensis and intermediate forms were designated as optimized formulations.
12: The droplet size, polydispersity index, and zeta-potential for F48/F44 were determined as 172.8/90.95 nm, 0.123/0.183, and -1.08/-2.08 mV, respectively.
13: These results were also confirmed by TEM analysis.
14: Prepared formulations displayed antibacterial activity against larval gut bacteria in the following order of decreasing inhibitory: LC  90, optimized nanoemulsions, and LC  50.
15: PREO-based formulations were more effective against mysorensis than intermediate.
16: Compared to the crude PREO, the overall larvicidal activity of all nanoformulations boosted by 20% and the optimized formulations by 50%.
17: The sensitivity of insect gut bacteria may be a crucial factor in determining the outcome of the effect of toxins on target insects.
18: The formulations designed in the present study may be a good option as a potent and selective larvicide for   An.
19: stephensi.
