0: AbstractBackgroundOrganic products of animals are getting more accepted by consumers.
1: Using herbal additives may lead to more health animal products.
2: In this research it is hypothesized that    Lavandula angustifolia and/or    Mentha spicata essential oils would be helpful to enhance production performance in laying hens.
3: ObjectivesThis experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of    Lavandula angustifolia and    Mentha spicata essential oils on performance, egg traits and blood variables in laying hens.
4: Methods144 Lohmann LSLLite laying hens from 42 until 56 weeks of age were used in a completely randomized design in four treatments and six replicates (six birds per replicate).
5: The treatments consisted of: (a) control group (basal diet), (b) basal diet supplemented with 250 mg/kg diet lavender essential oil (LEO), (c) basal diet supplemented with 250 mg/kg diet mint essential oil (MEO), and (d) basal diet supplemented with both LEO and MEO.ResultsUsing LEO and/or MEO did not affect body weight changes, feed intake, egg weight, egg index, yolk index, Haugh unit, egg shell weight and egg shell thickness.
6: Feeding LEO, individually or in combination with MEO, did not affect FCR compared with the control group (   p < .05), however, feeding MEO individually increased feed conversation ratio (FCR) compared to LEO and the control group during 4256 weeks (   p < .05), as well as decreasing egg mass compared to LEO (   p < .05).
7: Feeding LEO increased egg production compared to MEO and combination of MEO and LEO (   p < .05).
8: ConclusionsIn conclusion, dietary supplemental MEO (250 mg/kg) may increase FCR, and LEO (250 mg/kg) is more effective than MEO (250 mg/kg) for egg production and egg mass purposes; besides MEO (250 mg/kg) negatively affected FCR compared with the control group.
9: In addition, no specific beneficial effect of dietary supplemental MEO and/or LEO on the other measured variables was detected.
