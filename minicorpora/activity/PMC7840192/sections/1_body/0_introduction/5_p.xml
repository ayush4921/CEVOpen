It is stated that the improvement of FCR resulted from the increase in appetite due to the stimulation of salivary and gastric glands by spearmint oil, the decrease in pathogenic bacteria and better digestibility; besides, it is suggested that spearmint oil may stimulate salivary and gastric glands, and decrease bacteria which in turn improve digestibility and FCR (Abu Isha et al.,

 <xref rid="vms3343-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>) reported that, the addition of spearmint essential oil, to the diet increased significantly the feed intake of broiler chicks (Abu Isha et al., 
 <xref rid="vms3343-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). In addition, it is reported that feeding spearmint increases feed intake and consequently improves growth in broiler chickens (Saleh, Ijiri, &amp; Ohtsuka, 
 <xref rid="vms3343-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). Galib, Al‐kassi, and Noor (
