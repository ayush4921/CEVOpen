<p>All experimental protocols were adhered and were approved by the guidelines of the Animal Ethics Committee of Razi University, Kermanshah, Iran (The animal use protocol number: Anim Sci, 116, Sep 2017). Hundred and forty four Lohmann LSL‐Lite laying hens in Phase II (42 weeks of age) were weighed individually and randomly assigned to four treatments with six replicates and six birds in each replicate in a completely randomized design. Four dietary isocaloric and isonitrogenous diets were used during three experimental periods, 42–46, 47–51 and 52–56 weeks. An empty cage was kept between treatments to eliminate cross‐feeding. The birds were placed in the cages and kept under 16 hr of light/8 hr dark cycle during the entire experimental period (14 weeks). The birds were housed under temperature 18–20°C for 14 weeks. Average ambient relative humidity inside the rearing house was 40%. The feed was offered on the basis of the recommendations (110 g/hen/day), and water (18 ± 4°C) was supplied ad‐libitum. To meet nutritional requirements of laying hens as recommended by the Lohmann LSL‐Lite catalogue (Lohmann LSL‐Classic International 2011), a corn‐soybean meal basal diet, 14.69% crude protein and 2,750 kilocalories of metabolizable energy per kg of feed was formulated, since we tried to maintain constant ME:CP ratio (Table
