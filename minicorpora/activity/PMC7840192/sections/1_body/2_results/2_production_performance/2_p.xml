<p>The productivity data of laying hens are summarized in Table 
 <xref rid="vms3343-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>. The result of the present study showed that adding LEO and/or MEO essential oils did not affect feed intake and body weight changes during the experimental period (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05). In this research feeding LEO, individually or in combination with MEO, did not affect FCR compared with the control group (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), but feeding MEO individually increased FCR compared with LEO and the control group during 42–56 weeks (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05); besides, feeding MEO individually or in combination with MEO increased FCR compared with LEO and the control group during 42–46 weeks (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). In the present study, supplementation of MEO individually or in combination with LEO significantly decreased egg production and also egg mass values during 42–46 weeks (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Egg production was significantly increased due to LEO feeding compared to MEO and LEO + MEO groups during 42–56 weeks (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). LEO feeding also increased egg mass compared to MEO group during 42–56 weeks (
