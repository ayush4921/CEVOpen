<p>Supplementation of the layer diet with 
 <italic>Lavandula angustifolia</italic> and 
 <italic>Mentha spicata</italic> essential oils had no significant effects on egg weight, egg index, yolk index, HU, yolk colour and egg quality variables (egg weight and egg shell thickness). The results of this study are in agreement with those reported by Salari et al. who stated that feeding lavender essence (200, 400 and 600 ppm) did not affect HU (Salari et al., 
 <xref rid="vms3343-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). It was observed from this study that feeding MEO did not increase egg weight. Increased egg weight might be due to better utilization of nutrients by mint, which in turn resulted in better egg weight (Merina Devi, Palod, Dar, &amp; Shekhar, 
 <xref rid="vms3343-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). The results of the present study are not in line with the findings of Abdel‐Wareth and Lohakare, who reported that supplementation of peppermint leaves (5, 10, 15 or 20 g/kg) in laying hens improved egg weight due to the beneficial action of peppermint in the process of oviposition and imperative effect on the conversion of digested feed into eggs (Abdel‐Wareth &amp; Lohakare, 
 <xref rid="vms3343-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). Dietary MEO supplementation did not influence HU which is not in agreement with findings were recorded by Sayedpiran et al., (
 <xref rid="vms3343-bib-0050" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>) and Abdel‐Wareth and Lohakare, (
 <xref rid="vms3343-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). Different effects of supplemental mint on egg quality might stem from the amount and the source of mint extract.
