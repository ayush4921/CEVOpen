<p>Akbari and Torki reported that peppermint extract has increased total protein and HDL and decreased blood serum concentrations of total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL and glucose of broilers (Akbari &amp; Torki, 
 <xref rid="vms3343-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). Fallah, Kiani, &amp; Azarfar also reported that peppermint extract (200 meg/kg) has increased albumin, HDL and significantly reduced total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL and glucose in broilers (Fallah, Kiani, &amp; Azarfar, 
 <xref rid="vms3343-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). It seems as some components of peppermint including menthol and menthone have a potential to decrease blood lipids in broilers (Escop (European Scientific Cooperative on Phytotherapy), 
 <xref rid="vms3343-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>). Mansoub also reported that peppermint extract (0.75%, 1%, 1.5%, and 2%) increases albumin, total protein and HDL and also significantly decreases glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol and LDL in serum of broilers; he also suggested that the main reason for the reduction of serum lipids in broilers is due to the active ingredients of peppermint leaves such as tocopherol and menthol (Mansoub, 
 <xref rid="vms3343-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). Our observation in this experiment on blood biochemical variables is not in agreement with Hardari, Nobakht, and Safamehr (
