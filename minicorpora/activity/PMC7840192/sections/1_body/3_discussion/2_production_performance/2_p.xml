<p>Several medicinal plants (e.g., garlic, onion, thyme, spearmint, pepper, yucca, black cumin (black seed), ginger) have been used in animal and poultry (layers and broilers) production due to their health benefits, e.g., spearmint leaves is used as carminative, antispasmodic and choleretic in human reported by Al‐Kassie (

It is hypothesized that herb mixture (garlic, onion, thyme, spearmint, pepper, yucca, black cumin seed, and ginger) might have several vital benefits of such as antioxidant, antimicrobial and anti‐inflammatory, which raise its use as herbal feed additives as alternative to antibiotics in broilers diets (Saleh, Ebeid, &amp; Abudabos,

 <xref rid="vms3343-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). It is reported that, addition of spearmint essential oils, to the diet increased significantly the feed intake of broiler chicks (Abu Isha et al., 
 <xref rid="vms3343-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>), Feeding spearmint increases feed intake and consequently improves growth in broiler chicks (Saleh et al.,
