<p>The results of this experiment are in accordance with the results of Nasiri‐Moghaddam, Hassanabadi &amp; Bidar who did not observe any increases in egg weight, feed intake and egg production percentage by using lavender essence in the diets of layers (Nasiri‐Moghaddam et al., 
 <xref rid="vms3343-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). In addition, Bozkurt et al. showed that supplemented diets with mixture of essential oil (i.e., oregano oil, laurel leaf oil, sage leaf oil, myrtle leaf oil, fennel seed oil and citrus peel oil) (24 and 48 mg/kg of diet) did not affect egg production and egg weight of broiler breeders (Bozkurt et al., 
 <xref rid="vms3343-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). In another study (Botsoglou et al., 
 <xref rid="vms3343-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>), the effects of dietary aromatic plant extracts (rosemary at 5 g/kg diet, oregano at 5 g/kg diet and saffron at 20 mg/kg diet) on the laying performance of hens from 32 to 40 weeks of age were investigated and the results showed no significant differences in egg production and egg weight among the treatment groups.
