<p>In an experiment curcumin (0.5 g), capsaicin (0.015 g), piperine (0.02 g), ginger (0.05 g), cumin (1.25 g), asafoetida (0.25 g), ajwan (0.2 g), fennel (0.5 g), coriander (2.0 g), mint (1.0 g), garlic (0.5 g) and onion (2.0 g) could shorten the time of feed passage through digestive tract in rats (Platel &amp; Srinivasan, 
 <xref rid="vms3343-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>). Herbs with growth promoting activity increase the stability of feed and beneficially influence the gastrointestinal ecosystem mostly through growth inhibition of pathogenic microorganisms’ growth (Windisch, Schedle, Plitzner, &amp; Kroismayr, 
 <xref rid="vms3343-bib-0055" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). Therefore, it might be possible that the increase in digestion and absorption of essential nutrients due to increasing the enzyme activity and/ or inhibition of pathogenic microorganism's growth could be the main reason of medicinal plants to accelerate the performance.
