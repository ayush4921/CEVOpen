<p>The feed conversion ratio (FCR) describes the hens’ overall efficiency in converting ingested feed mass into egg mass over a specific period of time. An important claim often made for phytogenic feed additives is improvement of the FCR and thereby enhancing the intestinal availability of essential nutrients for absorption (Langhout,

 <xref rid="vms3343-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>). In this research feeding LEO, individually or combined with MEO, did not influence FCR compared with the control, but feeding MEO individually significantly increased FCR compared with LEO and control group during 42–56 weeks. In contrast, Nasiri‐Moghaddam et al., (
