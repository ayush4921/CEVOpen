<p>In this study, feed intake and body weight changes were not affected by supplemental MEO but FCR was affected by the supplementation of MEO compared to LEO and the control group. Body weight is not a common performance criteria in laying hens since hens are rather selected for laying performance and efficiency of feed conversion per unit of egg mass output. In a number of trials, laying rate, feed intake and FCR were not changed.
