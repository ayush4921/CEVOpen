<p>To offset the drug shortages and decrease the risk of treatment failures due to AMR, it is important to have multiple impetigo treatment options available. It is also quite clear that antibiotic-resistant bacteria are emerging faster than the pace of replacing the existing treatments with new antimicrobial agents [

Ideally, the newer treatment options should have unique modes of action compared to current topical impetigo antibiotics and possess strong activity against
