<p>Like other antibiotics, overuse of topical antibiotics can drive increased antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and rapid emergence of multidrug-resistant bacterial strains (MRSA and macrolide-resistant 
 <italic>S. pyogenes</italic>) is essentially threatening the availability of life saving treatments [

 <xref rid="B51-antibiotics-09-00909" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. According to a 2017 WHO report, MRSA is one of the “priority pathogens”, posing substantial risk to human health because they are resistant to most existing treatments [
 <xref rid="B52-antibiotics-09-00909" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In impetigo, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> resistance to fusidic acid, a traditionally used drug for impetigo treatment, has become ubiquitous, potentially limiting its overall efficacy [

 <xref rid="B56-antibiotics-09-00909" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The emergence of resistance to topical mupirocin, which is normally used as first-line impetigo treatment in different countries [

 <xref rid="B57-antibiotics-09-00909" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], has also been increasing particularly among MRSA isolates in many parts of the world, suggesting 24–65% high-level resistance to mupirocin in Australia [
 <xref rid="B58-antibiotics-09-00909" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], Canada [
 <xref rid="B59-antibiotics-09-00909" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], Jamaica [

 <xref rid="B63-antibiotics-09-00909" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Even though drug resistance to retapamulin, a newly introduced topical treatment for impetigo caused by MSSA and 
 <italic>S. pyogenes</italic>, is thought to be unlikely because of its unique mode of action [
 <xref rid="B20-antibiotics-09-00909" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], there is considerable emerging evidence on resistance of MRSA to this drug [

 <xref rid="B65-antibiotics-09-00909" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. A recent in vitro study from the United Kingdom investigating XF-73, retapamulin, mupirocin, fusidic acid, daptomycin, and vancomycin against MRSA, indicated that development of drug resistance to retapamulin would be inevitable in the near future [
 <xref rid="B64-antibiotics-09-00909" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Another in vitro study revealed 10% of the screened isolates showing resistance to retapamulin, of which 57.9% were MRSA [
