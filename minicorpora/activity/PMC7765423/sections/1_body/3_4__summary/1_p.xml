<p>Impetigo is a bacterial skin infection commonly seen in children. Globally, more than 162 million children suffer from impetigo at any one time. In Australia, impetigo affects up to 49% of Aboriginal children living in remote communities at any one time, making it the highest documented prevalence anywhere in the world. This infection could lead to potentially life-threatening conditions including invasive bacterial infection, chronic heart, and kidney diseases. In addition to these chronic complications, impetigo causes pain, itching, discomfort, and sleep disturbance, substantially impacting the wellbeing of those affected. Topical antimicrobials are typically used as first-line treatment options for impetigo. However, the troubling rise of AMR poses a serious challenge to topical antibiotics, almost inevitably requiring the use of life saving systemic antibiotics. This is particularly evident in endemic settings in Australiaâ€”and this approach would have enormous societal and clinical consequences. Hence, there is a critical need to explore safe and effective alternative antimicrobials for topical applications to disrupt the rise of AMR so that lifesaving systemic antibiotics can be persevered for life threatening complications. Considering their potent antibacterial activity against impetigo-causing bacteria, topical TTO, MO, and H
