0: Impetigo (school sores), a common superficial skin infection [ 4], is a huge problem worldwide, affecting >2% of the global population [ 3], and an estimated 162 million children (particularly those between the age of 2 and 5 years) suffer from impetigo at any one time [ 5, 6].
1: It is one of eight dermatologic conditions listed in the 50 most common causes of disease in the Global Burden of Disease study [ 7], and is the only skin condition with potentially life-threatening complications [ 8].
2: It is endemic in a number of low-and middle-income tropical countries, with the highest burden (median prevalence 19.4%) in underprivileged children from marginalised communities of high-income countries [ 5].
3: In Australia, up to 49% of Aboriginal children living in remote communities are affected by impetigo at any given time (median prevalence of 44.5%) [ 5], accounting for the highest rate documented anywhere in the world [ 9].
4: Given impetigo is considered a disease of the poor (i.e., burden increases as socio-economic status decreases), and its contagious nature [ 5], inadequate housing, and poor hygiene practices contribute to the growing burden of impetigo in the community [ 10].
