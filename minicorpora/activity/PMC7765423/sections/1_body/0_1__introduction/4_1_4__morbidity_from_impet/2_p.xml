<p>APSGN can develop within 2–6 weeks of untreated streptococcal infection [

 <xref rid="B31-antibiotics-09-00909" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. A recent study aimed at reviewing and comparing APSGN cases between 2009–2016 in Northern Australia with other countries reported that 94% of the cases found in Indigenous Australians, of which 86% of them were Indigenous children &lt;15 years of age [
 <xref rid="B32-antibiotics-09-00909" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Indigenous children (incidence, 124.0 per 100,000 per year) had incident rates much higher than non-Indigenous children (incidence, 7.4 per 100,000 per year). The study also showed the incidence of APSGN in children in northern Australia was the highest in the world [
 <xref rid="B32-antibiotics-09-00909" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], with a substantially increased risk of progressing to end stage renal disease later in life [
