0: The ARF occurs after a latency period of 23 weeks post streptococcal infection [ 30].
1: Approximately more than 60% of all ARF cases progress to RHD [ 29], and RHD is estimated to affect at least 2.4 million children (514 years) worldwide, with the vast majority (79% of cases) occurring in developing countries and marginalized communities of the developed nations [ 29].
2: There is a lack of well-designed studies to establish a clear link between impetigo and ARF in Indigenous communities [ 33].
3: However, reports from Australia and New Zealand [ 34, 35, 36] indicating high rates of ARF in settings with high incidence of impetigo and low rates of streptococcal pharyngitis could provide some insight into a plausible link between impetigo and ARF and its subsequent progression to RHD.
4: Further, ARF and RHD are highly prevalent among Indigenous communities than other Australians, with the highest rates of ARF found among children aged 515 years [ 37, 38, 39].
5: According to the Australian Government Institute of Health and Welfare report [ 38], Indigenous people are 69 times more likely to develop ARF than their non-Indigenous counterparts and 64 times more likely to have RHD, showing that ARF and RHD almost exclusively affect these communities.
6: Moreover, Indigenous Australians are up to 20 times more likely to die from ARF and RHD as opposed to other Australians [ 37].
7: In sum, the long-term consequences of ARF, invasive sepsis, kidney disease, and RHD result in lifelong chronic illness and premature disability in children.
