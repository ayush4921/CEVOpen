0: Morbidity of impetigo depends on the bacterial aetiology [ 15].
1: In impetigo elicited by  S. aureus, local and systemic spread of infection could result in cellulitis, lymphangitis, or septicaemia ( Figure 3) [ 13].
2: Skin infections are the most common signs of initial infection leading to Staphylococcal bacteraemia [ 25].
3: In Australia, the 30-day all-cause mortality rate for  S. aureus sepsis was 16.7% in 2016 and 14.8% in 2017, based on the Antimicrobial use and Resistance (AURA) 2019 report [ 25].
4: The annual incidence of invasive  S. aureus is 10 times higher (46.6 v 4.4 per 100,000 children) in the Indigenous paediatric population compared with the non-Indigenous counterparts living in impetigo endemic settings [ 26].
5: S. aureus sepsis has a mortality rate of 35% in children aged under 18 years, with particularly poor health outcomes in Indigenous children [ 27].
6: Similarly, infection with GAS can cause GAS bacteraemia, and Indigenous children (incidence, 69.7 per 100,000 per year) have the highest reported rates of invasive GAS, as opposed to non-Indigenous children (incidence, 8.8 per 100,000 per year) [ 28].
7: It can also cause acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN) and acute rheumatic fever (ARF), inflammatory illnesses that can potentially lead to chronic kidney disease (CKD) and rheumatic heart disease (RHD), respectively [ 29].
