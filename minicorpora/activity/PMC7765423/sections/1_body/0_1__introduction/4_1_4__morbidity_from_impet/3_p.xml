<p>The ARF occurs after a latency period of 2–3 weeks post streptococcal infection [
 <xref rid="B30-antibiotics-09-00909" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Approximately more than 60% of all ARF cases progress to RHD [
 <xref rid="B29-antibiotics-09-00909" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and RHD is estimated to affect at least 2.4 million children (5–14 years) worldwide, with the vast majority (79% of cases) occurring in developing countries and marginalized communities of the developed nations [
 <xref rid="B29-antibiotics-09-00909" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. There is a lack of well-designed studies to establish a clear link between impetigo and ARF in Indigenous communities [
 <xref rid="B33-antibiotics-09-00909" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, reports from Australia and New Zealand [
 <xref rid="B34-antibiotics-09-00909" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-antibiotics-09-00909" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="B36-antibiotics-09-00909" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] indicating high rates of ARF in settings with high incidence of impetigo and low rates of streptococcal pharyngitis could provide some insight into a plausible link between impetigo and ARF and its subsequent progression to RHD. Further, ARF and RHD are highly prevalent among Indigenous communities than other Australians, with the highest rates of ARF found among children aged 5–15 years [
 <xref rid="B37-antibiotics-09-00909" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="B38-antibiotics-09-00909" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="B39-antibiotics-09-00909" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. According to the Australian Government Institute of Health and Welfare report [
 <xref rid="B38-antibiotics-09-00909" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], Indigenous people are 69 times more likely to develop ARF than their non-Indigenous counterparts and 64 times more likely to have RHD, showing that ARF and RHD almost exclusively affect these communities. Moreover, Indigenous Australians are up to 20 times more likely to die from ARF and RHD as opposed to other Australians [
 <xref rid="B37-antibiotics-09-00909" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In sum, the long-term consequences of ARF, invasive sepsis, kidney disease, and RHD result in lifelong chronic illness and premature disability in children.
