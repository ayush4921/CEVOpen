0: APSGN can develop within 26 weeks of untreated streptococcal infection [ 30], and in Australia, APSGN is linked to streptococcal impetigo in endemic areas, as opposed to pharyngitis in non-endemic areas [ 31].
1: A recent study aimed at reviewing and comparing APSGN cases between 20092016 in Northern Australia with other countries reported that 94% of the cases found in Indigenous Australians, of which 86% of them were Indigenous children<15 years of age [ 32].
2: Indigenous children (incidence, 124.0 per 100,000 per year) had incident rates much higher than non-Indigenous children (incidence, 7.4 per 100,000 per year).
3: The study also showed the incidence of APSGN in children in northern Australia was the highest in the world [ 32], with a substantially increased risk of progressing to end stage renal disease later in life [ 30].
