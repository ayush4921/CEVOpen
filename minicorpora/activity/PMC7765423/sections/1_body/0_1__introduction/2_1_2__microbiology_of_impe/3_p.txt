0: Microbiology of skin sore swabs ( n = 872) taken from 508 Australian indigenous children revealed co-infection with  S. aureus and  S. pyogenes in 58% sores [ 18], whereas 24% and 9% of sores swabs found with isolates of  S. pyogenes and  S. aureus, respectively.
1: The study also revealed that 15% of the  S. aureus isolates were methicillin resistant  S. aureus (MRSA).
2: A randomised controlled trial (RCT) aimed at investigating oral co-trimoxazole versus intramuscular benzathine benzylpenicillin for impetigo in a highly endemic region in Australia, reported  S. aureus (81%;  n = 412),  S. pyogenes (90%;  n = 455), and co-infection (74%,  n = 377), including a total of 32% cases of MRSA isolates from the sores [ 19].
3: Another study conducted in a similar setting involved the collection of skin sore swabs from 41 children, revealed the presence of  S. aureus (81%),  S. pyogenes (44%), and co-infection of both organisms (37%) [ 16].
4: This study also reported that 39% of the  S. aureus isolates were MRSA.
