<p>Microbiology of skin sore swabs (
 <italic>n</italic> = 872) taken from 508 Australian indigenous children revealed co-infection with 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> in 58% sores [
 <xref rid="B18-antibiotics-09-00909" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], whereas 24% and 9% of sores swabs found with isolates of 
 <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, respectively. The study also revealed that 15% of the 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> isolates were methicillin resistant 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MRSA). A randomised controlled trial (RCT) aimed at investigating oral co-trimoxazole versus intramuscular benzathine benzylpenicillin for impetigo in a highly endemic region in Australia, reported 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (81%; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 412), 
 <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> (90%; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 455), and co-infection (74%, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 377), including a total of 32% cases of MRSA isolates from the sores [
 <xref rid="B19-antibiotics-09-00909" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Another study conducted in a similar setting involved the collection of skin sore swabs from 41 children, revealed the presence of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (81%), 
 <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> (44%), and co-infection of both organisms (37%) [
 <xref rid="B16-antibiotics-09-00909" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This study also reported that 39% of the 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> isolates were MRSA.
