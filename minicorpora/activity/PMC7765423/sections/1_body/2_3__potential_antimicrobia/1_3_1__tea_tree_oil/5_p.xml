<p>The mechanism by which TTO produces antibacterial action has not been fully elucidated. Evidence, however, show that treatment with TTO and/or its bioactive components may compromise the cytoplasmic membrane integrity of the bacteria, resulting in the leakage of cell contents, and subsequently disrupts the cellular homeostasis, progressing to cell death [

 <xref rid="B102-antibiotics-09-00909" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. This is attributed to the synergistic effect stemming from &gt;100 bioactive components of TTO. This may reduce the potential for developing resistance to TTO, as multiple simultaneous mutations would be required to overcome all the actions of the individual components [
