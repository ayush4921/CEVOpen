<p>Ever since the multidrug resistance microorganisms appeared as a major medical concern, screening of natural products, in search for new antimicrobial agents has become imperative [
 <xref rid="B78-antibiotics-09-00909" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Because of their inherent antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, insecticidal, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties, essential oils obtained from plant materials have traditionally been used for various medicinal purposes including treatment of skin infections, and there has been a growing global interest in their use as substitutes for synthetic antimicrobials [

 <xref rid="B82-antibiotics-09-00909" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. However, most of these essential oils have weak to moderate antimicrobial activities, and they are always overshadowed in practice by more active synthetic agents [

 <xref rid="B83-antibiotics-09-00909" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. In fact, only a few of them produce antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>S. pyogenes</italic>, and tea tree oil (TTO), an essential oil obtained from 
 <italic>Melaleuca alternifolia</italic>, is one of these rare essential oils that exhibits potent antibacterial activity against these bacteria [

 <xref rid="B85-antibiotics-09-00909" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. TTO has up to 100 different active compounds—the main constituents are terpinen-4-ol, γ-terpinene, α-terpinene,1,8-cineole, and terpinolene [

 <xref rid="B88-antibiotics-09-00909" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>], comprehensive skin sensitivity studies have concluded that TTO is safe for topical application when it is incorporated in a suitable pharmaceutical base at concentrations ≤25%, with no signs of allergic and/or contact skin sensitization [
