<p>The mechanisms of action of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> is not completely understood but it is attributed to the irreversible oxidative damages it could inflict on bacterial membranes and DNA [

 <xref rid="B131-antibiotics-09-00909" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>]. Evidence indicates that resistance to H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> has not yet been reported [
 <xref rid="B125-antibiotics-09-00909" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. However, this should be noted in light of limited antimicrobial susceptibility data on H
 <sub>2</sub>O
