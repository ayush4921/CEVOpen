0: Rhynchanthus beesianus is a medicinal, ornamental, and edible plant, and its essential oil has been used as an aromatic stomachic in China.
1: In this study, the chemical constituents, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory properties of flower essential oil (F-EO), leaf essential oil (L-EO), and stem essential oil (S-EO) of   R. beesianus were investigated for the first time.
2: According to the GC-FID/MS assay, the F-EO was mainly composed of bornyl formate (21.7%), 1,8-cineole (21.6%), borneol (9.7%), methyleugenol (7.7%),   -myrcene (5.4%), limonene (4.7%), camphene (4.5%), linalool (3.4%), and   -pinene (3.1%).
3: The predominant components of L-EO were bornyl formate (33.9%), borneol (13.2%), 1,8-cineole (12.1%), methyleugenol (8.0%), camphene (7.8%), bornyl acetate (6.2%), and   -pinene (4.3%).
4: The main components of S-EO were borneol (22.5%), 1,8-cineole (21.3%), methyleugenol (14.6%), bornyl formate (11.6%), and bornyl acetate (3.9%).
5: For the bioactivities, the F-EO, L-EO, and S-EO exhibited significant antibacterial property against   Bacillus subtilis,   Enterococcus faecalis,   Staphylococcus aureus,   Proteus vulgaris,   Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and   Escherichia coli with the inhibition zones (7.289.69 mm), MIC (3.1312.50 mg/mL), and MBC (6.2512.50 mg/mL).
6: Besides, the F-EO, L-EO, and S-EO significantly inhibited the production of proinflammatory mediator nitric oxide (NO) (93.1594.72%) and cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) (23.9977.81%) and tumor necrosis factor-   (TNF-  ) (17.6924.93%) in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells at the dose of 128   g/mL in the absence of cytotoxicity.
7: Hence, the essential oils of   R. beesianus flower, leaf, and stem could be used as natural antibacterial and anti-inflammatory agents with a high application potential in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic fields.
