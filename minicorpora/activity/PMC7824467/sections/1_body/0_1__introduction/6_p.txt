0: Chemokines constitute a family of chemoattractant cytokines.
1: These are small heparin-binding proteins involved in atherosclerosis by promoting directed migration of inflammatory cells.
2: Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), also known as monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), has been detected in atherosclerotic lesions [ 34].
3: CCL2 is also a potent mediator of chronic inflammation, triggering, for instance, inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis [ 35].
4: In addition, inflammatory response is characterized by increased production of tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) [ 35].
5: TNF-, interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6, secreted by macrophages, lymphocytes, natural killer cells and vascular smooth muscle cells, are considered pro-atherogenic cytokines [ 36].
6: Despite the reported anti-inflammatory potential of several EOs ( Table 2), their effect on the release of CCL2 is much less reported than the release of TNF-.
