 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> introduces the methodological features of this review article. The pedigree, frequency of treatment, administration route, and dose of the oils given to experimental animals were clearly described in all the articles. The main objectives and findings of the studies were clearly expressed. However, not all reports reported blind-assessment procedures. Only a few articles reported blind breeding and blind allocation of experimental animals.
