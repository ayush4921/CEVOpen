<p>There were 12 in vivo and 9 in vitro experiments. The influence of essential oil and its components on the inflammatory disease model was investigated in vitro using an inflammatory disease model constructed with a variety of cell lines. Using in vivo experiments, 12 articles studied the effects of traditional Chinese medicine essential oils and their active components on a variety of inflammatory disease models based on mice, rats, or rabbits. The oils showed a significant inhibitory effect on inflammation. Part of the chemical structure of traditional Chinese medicine essential oils is shown in
