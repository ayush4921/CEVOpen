<p>The essential oils extracted from crude 
 <italic>A. macrocephala</italic> (CA) and bran-processed 
 <italic>A. macrocephala</italic> (BA) are CAEOs and BAEOs [
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The main components of these two essential oils are Atractylone [
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Atractylone effectively inhibited the level of NO in an allergic rhinitis (AR) model [
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Atractylone can reduce AR biomarkers and exert a certain anti-inflammatory effect. CAEOs and BAEOs not only exert anti-inflammatory effects but also inhibit gastric cancer, intestinal cancer, and liver cancer cells [
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. These two essential oils have the potential to treat AR. Essential oils can be inhaled into the nasal cavity, which is the best route of administration [
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. They will be the preferred raw materials for the treatment of AR in the future.
