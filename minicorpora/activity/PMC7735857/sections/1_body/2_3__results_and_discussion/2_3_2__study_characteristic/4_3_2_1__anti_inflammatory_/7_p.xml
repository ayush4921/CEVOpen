<p>The skin is the largest sense organ in humans and plays an important role in immune defense [

 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] significantly reduced the levels of TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>, IL-6, and IL-1 in inflammatory models. The main components of EOCl are terpinolene and phellandrene. The essential oil from 
 <italic>Citrus limetta</italic> Risso peels (Clp-EO) is also a candidate for treating skin inflammation [

 <italic>α</italic>, IL-6, and IL-1
 <italic>β</italic> in inflammation models and can reduce the levels of ROS under oxidative stress conditions. These two kinds of Chinese herbal essential oils can reduce the levels of various oxidative stress markers. They play antioxidant roles, including a therapeutic role in skin inflammation.
