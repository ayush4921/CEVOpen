0: Inflammation can usually be classified into two categories according to its course: acute inflammation and chronic inflammation.
1: The immune system plays a key role in determining whether inflammation is acute or chronic.
2: The activation of inflammation is closely related to immune cells and biological molecules.
3: In particular, innate lymphoid cells (LCs), with multiple immune functions, play important roles in inflammatory diseases [ 6].
4: Infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils is a feature of acute inflammation, and infiltration of T lymphocytes and plasma cells is a feature of chronic inflammation [ 7].
5: These cells play important roles in the inflammatory response.
