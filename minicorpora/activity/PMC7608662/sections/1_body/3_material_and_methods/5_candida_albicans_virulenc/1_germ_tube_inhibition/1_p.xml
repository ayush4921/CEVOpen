<p id="Par39">Cell suspensions (1.0 ± 0.2 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU/mL) from overnight SDA cultures were prepared in NYP medium [N-acetylglucosamine (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA; 10
 <sup>–3</sup> mol/L), yeast nitrogen base (Difco, Detroit, MI, USA; 3.35 g/L), proline (Fluka; 1023 mol/L) and NaCl (4.5 g/L), pH 6.7 ± 0.1]. Serial two-fold essential oil dilutions were previously prepared in DMSO [maximum concentration of 1% (v/v)], and added to the inoculum suspensions to obtain a range of test concentrations from MIC value to MIC/64 (1.25–0.02 μL/mL). Oil-free controls with and without DMSO were included. After 3 h of incubation in a static chamber at 37 °C, homogenized cell suspensions of each treatment were mounted onto a Neubauer chamber; 100 cells per replica were counted and visually scored, excluding gemulating cells. The percentage of filamentation was defined as the number of cells in which the size of the germ tube was equal or bigger than the blastopore’s diameter.
