<p id="Par22">Our results demonstrate that 
 <italic>T. albicans</italic> oil was able to inhibit nitrites production by LPS-stimulated macrophages in a dose-dependent manner. Importantly, a significant reduction by 27.16 and 41.32%, was observed at the non-cytotoxic concentrations of 0.32 and 0.64 μL/mL, respectively, in comparison with the LPS stimuli (Fig.

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>
 </sup> evaluated the effect of 1,8-cineole on the same parameter, demonstrating that it also inhibited the production of nitrites, however at higher concentrations (2.25 μL/mL). This indicates that other compounds may contribute to the anti-inflammatory activity of 
 <italic>T. albicans</italic> oil.
