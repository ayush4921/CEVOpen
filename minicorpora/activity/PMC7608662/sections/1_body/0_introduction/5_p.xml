 <italic>Thymus mastichina</italic> is one of the most industrially relevant thyme species, currently employed in the production of cleaning products, perfumes, fragrances, soaps and other cosmetics
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>
 </sup>. It is widely cultivated in Portugal and Spain, and has an ISO standard (4728:2003) specifying the quality parameters of the essential oil for industrial and commercial uses
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>
 </sup>. Several pharmacological activities have been reported for 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> essential oil, including antimicrobial activity
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>
 </sup>, anti-inflammatory potential
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>
 </sup>, antioxidant activity
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–

 </sup> and cytotoxicity against cancer cell lines
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>
 </sup>. Due to the similarities between the chemical profile of 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> and 
 <italic>T. albicans</italic> essential oils, it seems reasonable to assume that both species might possess similar bioactive properties. This assumption is in part corroborated by previous studies showing the antibacterial activity of 
 <italic>T. albicans</italic> essential oil against Gram-positive bacteria
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>
 </sup>, its antioxidant activity
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>
 </sup>, its capacity to scavenge nitric oxide and to inhibit the activity of lipoxygenase in vitro, both commonly used as markers of anti-inflammatory potential
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>
 </sup>. As far as we know, those are the only studies on the bioactive potential of 
 <italic>T. albicans</italic> essential oil. More studies are needed to further confirm the reported effects and to explore new bioactivities.
