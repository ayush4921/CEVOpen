 <caption> Effect of Thymus albicans essential oil on the iNOS and COX-2 protein levels in LPS stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. Cells (1.2 × 10 6 cells/well) were kept 24 h in medium (control) or pre-treated for 1 h with 0.64 μL/mL of T. albicans essential oil and then stimulated with LPS (1 μg/mL). Total cell lysates were analyzed by western blot. Results are expressed as protein levels compared to LPS. Statistical differences were calculated by two-tailed unpaired student’s t-test (### p &lt; 0.001, compared to control; ** p &lt; 0.01, *** p &lt; 0.001, compared to LPS). </caption>
