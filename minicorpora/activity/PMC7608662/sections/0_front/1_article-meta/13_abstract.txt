0: Thymus albicans is an endemic species of the Iberian Peninsula with a vulnerable conservation status.
1: In an attempt to contribute to the valorization of this species, the present study brings new insights on the antifungal and anti-inflammatory mechanism of action of   T. albicans essential oil.
2: The antifungal activity of the oil and its major compounds was assessed for the first time against standard and clinically isolated strains of yeasts and filamentous fungi.
3: The effect on the two major virulence factors of   Candida albicans (germ tube formation and biofilm disruption) was considered in more detail.
4: At 0.08 L/mL, the oil inhibited   C. albicans germ tube formation by more than 40% and decreased biofilm biomass at MIC values, thus pointing out its antivirulent potential.
5: The anti-inflammatory activity of the essential oil was investigated on LPS-stimulated mouse macrophages (RAW 264.7) by evaluating the levels of several pro-inflammatory mediators, namely nitric oxide (NO), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2).
6: T. albicans oil reduced the production of nitrites, a NO derived sub-product, at non-cytotoxic concentrations of 0.32 and 0.64 L/mL, by 27 and 41%, respectively.
7: In addition, the iNOS protein levels of essential oil pre-treated cells were reduced by 14%.
8: Overall, the high essential oil yield of   T. albicans as well as its bioactive effects at concentrations without cytotoxicity, encourage further studies on the potential pharmacological applications of this species.
9: Furthermore, these results raise awareness for the need to preserve endangered species that may hold relevant medicinal value.
