0: BackgroundElaeagnus umbellata Thunb.
1: (autumn olive) is a high valued medicinal plant.
2: It belongs to    Elaeagnaceae family and is widely distributed in Himalayan regions of Pakistan.
3: In the present study essential oil were extracted from the fruit of this plant and their antioxidant, anticholinesterase and antidiabetic potentials were also evaluated.
4: MethodsEssential oils were extracted from the fruit of    E. umbellata using hydro-distillation method and were characterized by GC-MS.
5: The extracted oil were tested for its antioxidant, anticholinesterase, and antidiabetic potentials using standard protocols.
6: ResultsAbout 68 compounds were identified by GC-MS.
7: The extracted oil exhibited a fairly high free radical scavenging activities against DPPH and ABTS radicals with IC   50 values of 70 and 105 g/mL respectively (for ascorbic acid, used as standard, the IC   50 values were 32 and 29 g/mL, respectively against the mentioned radicals).
8: The essential oil also exhibited anticholinesterase activities with IC   50 values of 48 and 90 g/mL respectively against AChE and BChE (for galantamine used as standard, the IC   50 values were 25 and 30 g/mL respectively).
9: The essential oil also exhibited antidiabetic potential with IC   50 values of 120 and 110 g/mL respectively against -glucosidase and -amylase (IC   50 values for standard acarbose = 28 and 30 g/mL respectively).
10: ConclusionEssential oil extracted from the fruits of    E. umbellata exhibited reasonable antioxidant, anticholinesterase, and antidiabetic potentials that could be used as alternative medicine in treating diabetes and neurodegenerative disorders.
11: However, further studies are needed to isolate responsible compounds and evaluate the observed potential in animal models.
