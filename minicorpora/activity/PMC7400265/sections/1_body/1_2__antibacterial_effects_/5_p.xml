<p>Hemp seed oil–water emulsions have also been under investigation for pharmaceutical and cosmetic applications, due to their low toxicity and biodegradability. The antimicrobial activity of two emulsions, consisting of both unrefined and refined oil, was determined. Overall, the bactericidal effect against Gram-positive pathogens was modest and less so for Gram-negative bacteria (virtually zero activity against 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> CCM 3954 was observed). The refined oil was also less potent than the unrefined oil. This could be due to the higher content of α-linolenic acid in the latter, or more likely the fact that ∆
 <sup>9</sup>-THC is removed during the refinement process [

 <italic>C. sativa</italic> leaves have also been tested against both clinical samples and nonclinical MRSA isolates, via the disc diffusion method. For the clinical isolates, the inhibition zone diameter ranged 9–15 mm, which was somewhat less than vancomycin (13–24 mm). However, 1:1 combination with other medicinal plant extracts such as 
 <italic>Psidium guajava</italic> and 
 <italic>Thuja orientalis</italic> demonstrated a synergistic effect, whereby inhibition zone diameters ranged 25–30 mm in most cases. This synergy may be due to the presence of quercetin, gallic acid and flavonoids such as catechin, which were detected in the leaf extracts; however, no cannabinoids were detected [

 <italic>C. sativa</italic> seed extracts on 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> biofilm formation, which indicates that these extracts could have enormous potential as preservatives in both the food and cosmetics industries [
 <xref rid="B53-antibiotics-09-00406" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Similarly, Stahl et al. found that cannabinoids are more effective in reducing the bacterial colony count in dental plaque when compared with commercial toothpastes such as Oral B and Colgate, which suggests that 
 <italic>C. sativa</italic>-derived compounds could be used for oral care applications [
