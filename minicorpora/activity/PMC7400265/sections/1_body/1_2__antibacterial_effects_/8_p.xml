<p>An interesting application for 
 <italic>C. sativa</italic>-derived compounds is to use them for water filtration and purification purposes. Nadir et al. immobilized a mixture of cannabinoids and terpenes onto a polyethersulfone hybrid membrane. Bacterial decline was observed for both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens. For example, an 88% decrease bacterial load for 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> was measured for the hybrid membrane compared to 30% for the standard membrane. Similar results were reported for several other species, including for 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. This study represents a cost-effective solution for water filtration and antibacterial purification [

 <italic>C. sativa</italic> and its antimicrobial properties for applications in food, agriculture and drug discovery.
