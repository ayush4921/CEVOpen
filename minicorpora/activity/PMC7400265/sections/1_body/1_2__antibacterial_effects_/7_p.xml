<p>Recently, Iseppi and co-workers conducted an extensive phytochemical characterization of 17 hemp essential oils from different varieties. Seventy-one compounds were identified, with the terpenes β-myrcene, α-pinene, α-terpinolene, β-pinene, 
 <italic>trans</italic>-ocimene and limonene being the most abundant. CBDV, CBC and CBD were also detected, but below 0.05% of the percentage area in each chromatogram. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of each oil were determined against a panel of Gram-positive pathogens and were found to have moderate to good antimicrobial activity. To determine the source of the observed antibacterial effect, the afore-mentioned terpenes and CBD were also evaluated. In general, good to moderate activity was observed against 
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> and 
 <italic>Enterococcus</italic> isolates, but slightly less so for 
 <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> and 
 <italic>Bacillus</italic> isolates. Therefore, the antimicrobial effect is likely to be due to synergism between several compounds that are present in the essential oils [
