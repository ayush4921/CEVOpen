<p>Sarmadyan et al. investigated the antimicrobial properties of “Hashish” against common hospital-associated bacterial strains [
 <xref rid="B48-antibiotics-09-00406" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Disk diffusion experiments found that cannabis extract exerted the greatest antimicrobial effects on 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> 25923, with an inhibition zone of 14 mm, followed by MRSA, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> with values of 12, 10 and 7 mm, respectively. No activity was observed in 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> or 
 <italic>A. baumannii</italic>. This trend regarding spectrum of activity is consistent with the findings of Vu et al., whereby extracts from Vietnamese derived 
 <italic>C. sativa</italic> plants were found to possess modest antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, with Gram-negative bacteria being less susceptible [
 <xref rid="B49-antibiotics-09-00406" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Similarly, Lelario and co-workers also observed that the major components of 
 <italic>C. sativa</italic> extracts displayed moderate activity only against Gram-positive pathogens [
