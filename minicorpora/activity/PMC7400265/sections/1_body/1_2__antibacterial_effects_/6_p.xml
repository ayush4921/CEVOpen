<p>Investigation is also underway into the biological activity of commercially viable âˆ†
 <sup>9</sup>-THC-free essential oil of 
 <italic>C. sativa</italic>, which could have medicinal, cosmetic, veterinary, agronomic or food applications. The oil was evaluated against several 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains and exhibited both a moderate antibacterial effect and antibiofilm activity, which was partly attributable to the flavanone naringenin. Antimicrobial activity was also observed against 
 <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> (a Gram-negative organism) but no anti-fungal activity was observed. This study demonstrates that 
 <italic>C. sativa</italic> is a rich source of biologically active compounds and that its antimicrobial properties are not solely attributable to cannabinoids [

 <italic>Propionibacterium acnes</italic> as well as possess an anti-inflammatory effect [
