<p>Lone and Lone investigated and compared the protein yield and antimicrobial and antioxidant effects of 
 <italic>C. sativa</italic> following both aqueous and acetone extraction [
 <xref rid="B47-antibiotics-09-00406" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. From 500 g samples, protein extraction from aqueous methodologies yielded 4.8 g of crude extract and 3.2 g from acetone. When compared with the aqueous extract, the acetone extract displayed fractionally superior bactericidal properties. A concentration-dependent response was observed against all strains, with 
 <italic>V. cholera</italic> being marginally the most responsive bacteria, closely followed by 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. The fungal response was slightly more pronounced in 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> compared to 
 <italic>C. neoforms</italic>. Additionally, this study found that 
 <italic>C. sativa</italic> has antioxidant properties, thus widening its potential for clinical use.
