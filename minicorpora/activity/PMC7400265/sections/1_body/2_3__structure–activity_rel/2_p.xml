<p>A study by van Klingeren et al. found that both ∆
 <sup>9</sup>-THC and CBD were active against several 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic> isolates, with MICs in the order of 1–5 μg/mL (
 <bold>1</bold>, 
 <bold>2</bold>) [

However, this bactericidal effect was attenuated in the presence of horse serum, possibly due to the cannabinoids binding to plasma proteins. Only poor antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative pathogens was observed. Turner and co-workers evaluated the antibacterial and antifungal properties of a panel of cannabichromene analogs [
 <xref rid="B59-antibiotics-09-00406" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The 
 <italic>n</italic>-pentyl chain meta to the alcohol group appears to be important for activity against 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (
 <bold>3</bold>–
 <bold>5</bold>). Interestingly, truncation to a methyl group appeared to enhance antifungal activity. Isocannabichromenes were also investigated (
 <bold>6</bold>, 
 <bold>7</bold>) but were slightly less active than their analogous cannabichromene. This class of cannabinoid does not induce intoxicating effects, which improves their therapeutic potential.
