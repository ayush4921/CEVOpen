0: Cannabis sativa is an herbaceous plant that belongs to the family Cannabinaceae [ 6].
1: It has been used by humans for over 5,000 years for medicinal and recreational uses, firstly in Central and Northeast Asia and subsequently spreading worldwide [ 7].
2: Cannabis, or marijuana, is undoubtedly one of the most widely used illicit drugs [ 8].
3: It has a complex chemical composition that includes cannabinoids [ 9], which are a group of secondary metabolites, several of which are responsible for the psychotropic effects [ 10, 11].
4: Metabolic fingerprinting of  C. sativa unveiled more than 480 compounds, including many terpenes and approximately 180 cannabinoids [ 12].
5: Their biosynthesis involves the alkylation of olivetolic acid with geranyl diphosphate, which is catalyzed via geranyl transferase [ 13].
6: This reaction leads to the formation of cannabigerolic acid (CBGA,  Figure 1A), which is a precursor molecule for numerous other cannabinoids, such as  9-tetrahydrocannbinol ( 9-THC), cannabidiol (CBD), cannabigerol (CBG), cannabinol (CBN) and cannabichromene (CBC) (see  Figure 1BF) [ 14, 15].
