0: The discovery of antibiotics is undoubtedly one of the most important scientific achievements in modern medicine and has saved millions of lives since their discovery.
1: However, their misuse has resulted in the emergence of antibacterial resistance (AMR), which is a significant threat to global human health.
2: It is estimated that global deaths could reach 10 million per year by 2050 with a cumulative cost to global economic output of US$100 trillion [ 1].
3: The World Health Organization has highlighted that AMR is one of the three greatest threats to healthcare systems globally [ 2].
4: For example, immuno-compromised patients such as organ transplant recipients and those who are undergoing chemotherapy treatment are particularly vulnerable and depend on the efficacy of antibiotics to fight off infection [ 3, 4].
5: The spread of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria therefore threaten these significant advancements in medical care.
6: Despite this, only four new classes of antibiotics have reached the clinic in the past four decades [ 5].
7: The development of new classes of anti-infective agents with novel modes of action is therefore essential to address the growing threat of AMR.
