0: A post-antibiotic world is fast becoming a reality, given the rapid emergence of pathogens that are resistant to current drugs.
1: Therefore, there is an urgent need to discover new classes of potent antimicrobial agents with novel modes of action.
2: Cannabis sativa is an herbaceous plant that has been used for millennia for medicinal and recreational purposes.
3: Its bioactivity is largely due to a class of compounds known as cannabinoids.
4: Recently, these natural products and their analogs have been screened for their antimicrobial properties, in the quest to discover new anti-infective agents.
5: This paper seeks to review the research to date on cannabinoids in this context, including an analysis of structureactivity relationships.
6: It is hoped that it will stimulate further interest in this important issue.
