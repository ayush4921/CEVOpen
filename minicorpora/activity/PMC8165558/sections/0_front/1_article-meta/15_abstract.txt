0: Anti-quorum sensing (QS) or quorum quenching (QQ) is known as a new anti-bacterial strategy to combat bacterial infection.
1: One of the best candidates for this strategy is a natural plant or traditional herbal medicine.
2: This review aimed to summarize and introduce Iranian medicinal plants with anti-QS properties.
3: Biomedical databases (PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar and Web of sciences) were investigated to retrieve all related manuscripts published in English and Persian.
4: Out of 65 documents, 47 papers were published during 20102020.
5: We categorized and summarized 19 papers that particularly presented the anti-QS activity of Iranian medicinal plants.
6: Based on our results, different studies have been completed on the QQ effects of medicinal plants.
7: We identified 106 plant species with different properties in medicine that have been evaluated for anti-QS activities in Iran.
8: The QQ effects of herbal extracts were identified through different   in vitro examinations on biosensor and clinical bacterial strains.
9: Only 35 medicinal plants have shown these effects at sub-MICs.
10: Our review summarizes Iranian medicinal plants with anti-QS properties.
11: Some of these herbal extracts showed anti-QS activity against biosensors, standard and clinical bacterial strains.
12: This result is very important because QS systems can be considered as a new target for the development of new remedial strategies and it is a good opportunity to perform QQ studies to effectively combat bacterial infections in the future.
