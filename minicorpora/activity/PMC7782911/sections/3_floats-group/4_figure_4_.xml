  <p>Cross section from wound area: (A) NCG group, (B) MG group, (C and D) 2 and 4% ZMEO-treated groups. Note well-formed collagen deposition in cross sections from ZMEO-treated animals on day 7 after wound induction (first row), which is significantly increased on day 14 after injury (second row). The third row represents the software analyze for collagen intensity. The cross sections from animals in ZMEO-treated groups exhibited condense collagen deposition versus NCG and MG groups. Masson-trichrome staining and fluorescent staining for collagen, 400Ã— magnification.</p>
