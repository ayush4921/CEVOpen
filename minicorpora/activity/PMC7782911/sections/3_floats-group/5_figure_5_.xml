  <p>Cross section from wound area: (A) NCG group, (B) MG group, (C and D) 2 and 4% ZMEO-treated groups. See well re-epithelialization in ZMEO-treated animals. The re-epithelialization initiated on day 7 after wound induction in ZMEO-treated animals. However, the cross sections from NCG and MG groups are not representing epithelialization. Note well-organized dermis and complete epithelialization with well-formed papillae in ZMEO-treated animals in comparison to NCG and MG groups. Masson-trichrome staining, 100Ã—.</p>
