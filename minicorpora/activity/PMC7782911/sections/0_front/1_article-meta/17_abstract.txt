0: AbstractContextZataria multiflora Boiss (Lamiaceae) essential oil (ZME) is believed to be a bactericide herbal medicine and might alleviate negative effects of infection.
1: ObjectiveThis study evaluates the effects of an ointment prepared from ZME (ZMEO) on infected wounds.Materials and methodsA full-thickness excisional skin wound was surgically created in each mouse and inoculated with 5  10   7 suspension containing    Pseudomonas aeruginosa and    Staphylococcus aureus.
2: The BALB/c mice (   n = 72) were divided into four groups: (1) negative control that received base ointment (NCG), (2) positive control that daily received Mupirocin    (MG), (3) therapeutic ointment containing 2% ZMEO and (4) therapeutic ointment containing 4% ZMEO, for 21 days.
3: Wound contraction, total bacterial count, histopathological parameters, antioxidant activity, qRT-PCR analysis for expression of IL-1, TNF-, VEGF, IGF-1, TGF-, IL-10, and FGF-2 mRNA levels were assessed on days 3, 7, and 14 following the wounding.
4: ResultsTopical administration of ZMEO significantly decreased the total bacterial count and wound area and also expression of IL-1 and TNF- compared to the control groups (   p < 0.05) in all days.
5: This could also increase significantly the expression of TGF-, IL-10 IGF-1, FGF-2, and VEGF, and also angiogenesis, fibroblasts, fibrocytes, epithelialization ratio, and collagen deposition and improve antioxidant status compared to the control group (   p < 0.05).
6: Discussion and conclusionZMEO accelerated the healing process of infected wounds by shortening the inflammatory factors and increasing proliferative phase.
7: Applying ZMEO only and/or in combination with chemical agents for the treatment of wound healing could be suggested.
