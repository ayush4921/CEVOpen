  <title>Context</title>
  <p>
   <italic>Zataria multiflora</italic> Boiss (Lamiaceae) essential oil (ZME) is believed to be a bactericide herbal medicine and might alleviate negative effects of infection.

 <sec>
  <title>Objective</title>
  <p>This study evaluates the effects of an ointment prepared from ZME (ZMEO) on infected wounds.</p>

  <title>Materials and methods</title>
  <p>A full-thickness excisional skin wound was surgically created in each mouse and inoculated with 5 × 10
   <sup>7</sup> suspension containing 
   <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and 
   <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. The BALB/c mice (
   <italic>n</italic> = 72) were divided into four groups: (1) negative control that received base ointment (NCG), (2) positive control that daily received Mupirocin
   <sup>®</sup> (MG), (3) therapeutic ointment containing 2% ZMEO and (4) therapeutic ointment containing 4% ZMEO, for 21 days. Wound contraction, total bacterial count, histopathological parameters, antioxidant activity, qRT-PCR analysis for expression of IL-1β, TNF-α, VEGF, IGF-1, TGF-β, IL-10, and FGF-2 mRNA levels were assessed on days 3, 7, and 14 following the wounding.
  </p>

 <sec>
  <title>Results</title>
  <p>Topical administration of ZMEO significantly decreased the total bacterial count and wound area and also expression of IL-1β and TNF-α compared to the control groups (
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in all days. This could also increase significantly the expression of TGF-β, IL-10 IGF-1, FGF-2, and VEGF, and also angiogenesis, fibroblasts, fibrocytes, epithelialization ratio, and collagen deposition and improve antioxidant status compared to the control group (
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05).
  </p>
 </sec>
 <sec>
  <title>Discussion and conclusion</title>
  <p>ZMEO accelerated the healing process of infected wounds by shortening the inflammatory factors and increasing proliferative phase. Applying ZMEO only and/or in combination with chemical agents for the treatment of wound healing could be suggested.</p>
