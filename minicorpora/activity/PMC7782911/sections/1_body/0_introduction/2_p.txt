0: Zataria multiflora Boiss (Lamiaceae) (ZM) has antibacterial activity against  Pseudomonas spp.
1: (Barkhori-Mehni et al.
2: 2017).
3: Its antibacterial activity is attributed to its phenolic compounds that destroy the cell wall in bacteria (Barkhori-Mehni et al.
4: 2017).
5: It demonstrates antioxidant properties due to its compounds such as thymol and carvacrol (Mojaddar Langroodi et al.
6: 2019).
7: Seemingly, ZM can accelerate the wound healing process due to its antibacterial and antioxidant features, but no studies have been conducted yet to evaluate the  Zataria multiflora essential oil (ZME) on the wound healing process.
8: Therefore, this study was conducted to evaluate the effect of an ointment prepared from ZME on the healing process of infected wound model by  S. aureus and  P. aeruginosa by assessing wound contraction, total bacterial count, histopathological and immunohistochemical, antioxidant activity, and qRT-PCR analyses.
