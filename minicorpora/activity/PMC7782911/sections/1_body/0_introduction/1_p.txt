0: Wound infections are important challenges that cause the suffering of patients and economic losses (Vittorazzi et al.
1: 2016; Daemi et al.
2: 2019a; Farghali et al.
3: 2019).
4: Skin is a regenerative organ which acts as a barrier between the body and the external environment (Hassan et al.
5: 2014).
6: A wound is defined as a disturbance in anatomic structure of skin and its functional integrity (Farghali et al.
7: 2019).
8: Skin prevents the penetration of bacteria and fungi that are important challenges that induce mortality and morbidity.
9: Pseudomonas aeruginosa and  Staphylococcus aureus are opportunistic bacteria that induce infection in patients (Cardona and Wilson  2015).
10: The bacteria are commonly detected in the upper and deepest region of wound bed (Serra et al.
11: 2015).
12: Colonization of  S. aureus and  P. aeruginosa in the wound site postpones the wound healing process (Farahpour et al.
13: 2020; Khezri et al.
14: 2020).
15: The wound healing process comprises several phases, including coagulation, inflammation, epithelialization, granulation tissue formation, and tissue remodelling (Daemi et al.
16: 2019a,  2019b; Farahpour et al.
17: 2020).
18: Inflammatory phase occurs after activation of inflammatory chemokines (Farahpour et al.
19: 2020).
20: Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is significantly synthesized 1224 h after infliction of the wound, and its level returns to basal level after the proliferative stage is completed (Fahey and Doyle  2019).
21: Tumour necrosis factor- (TNF-) is significantly synthesized by macrophages and T lymphocytes and its level increases under inflammation and infection conditions (Xue and Falcon  2019).
22: Following the induction of inflammation, proliferative phase occurs in which many genes are involved.
23: Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) promotes the production of keratinocyte and fibroblast proliferation and improves the re-epithelialization (Daemi et al.
24: 2019b).
25: Decreased endothelial insulin/IGF-1 signal delays in the wound healing process (Aghdam et al.
26: 2012).
27: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) induces angiogenesis and stimulates cell migration and proliferation (Farahpour et al.
28: 2020).
29: Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) is a protein that participates in the wound healing process (Souto et al.
30: 2020).
31: Interleukin-10 (IL-10) reduces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokine, but tumour growth factor- (TGF-) has roles in increasing the proliferative phase improving the proliferation and differentiation of fibroblasts, collagen production, and wound contraction (Khezri et al.
32: 2020).
33: On the other hand, oxidative stress increases under wound disorders and increases the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the site of wound (Ustuner et al.
34: 2019).
35: Applying antibacterial and antioxidant agents shortens the inflammatory phase, promotes the proliferative phase and accelerates the wound healing process (Bardaa et al.
36: 2016; Vittorazzi et al.
37: 2016; Daemi et al.
38: 2019a,  2019b).
