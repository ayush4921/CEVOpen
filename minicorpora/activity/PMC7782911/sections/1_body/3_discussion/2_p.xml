<p>Inflammation is the first step in the wound healing process, in which different factors and genes are involved. Inflammation is triggered once the injury induces to living tissues by live organisms, such as bacteria and/or physical injury and faulted immune response. Inflammation removes foreign substances in order to improve the wound healing process (Garrett et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). It promotes macrophages, neutrophils and immune cells for initiation of inflammation (Oguntibeju 
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). IL-1β and TNF-α are commonly produced by immune cells, such as macrophages and mast cells (Thacker et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). The results showed that the topical application of ZMEO decreased immune cells and the expressions of IL-1β and TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> in the first 3 days. The results implied a positive relation between the number of immune cells with the expression of IL-1β and TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> in the treatments. Meaning that immune cells increase the expression of IL-1β and TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> in the first 3 days. Increased inflammation delays the wound healing process. The findings revealed that topical administration of ZMEO decreased inflammation on days 7 and 14, and acted as an antibacterial and anti-inflammation agent. Antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activity of ZMEO is attributed to its compounds. The essence contains thymol and carvacrol that are of antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. It was reported that the administration of carvacrol significantly reduced TNF-α levels in pleural lavage (Guimarães et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). The anti-inflammatory activity of thymol leads to prevention of the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and nuclear factor-κB (Liang et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Carvacrol prevented leukocyte migration, and decreased edoema, and showed anti-inflammatory effects (Fachini-Queiroz et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). The results indicated that immune cells decreased and expression of IL-1β and TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> also decreased in ZMEO groups. The findings showed that the total bacterial count significantly decreased in ZMEO groups compared to the NCG group. Mupirocin is used as a bactericide agent for the treatment of infected wounds. The results convey that ZMEO, particularly at a higher level, have better antibacterial activity compared to mupirocin. Higher total bacterial count increases the inflammation and delays the wound healing process. It means that topical administration of ZMEO decreases the inflammation with its antibacterial activity. It was reported that the antibacterial activity of 
 <italic>Zataria multiflora</italic> is in view of its compounds (Shafiee et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Barkhori-Mehni et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). In essence, ZMEO decreased the inflammation and inflammatory-associated parameters. Higher levels of ZMEO provide higher doses of active compounds that act as anti-inflammatory factors. Decreased inflammation leads the wound healing process towards the proliferative phase.
