 <xref rid="CIT6612" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). The IHC was conducted based on manufacturer’s protocol (Biocare, Yorba Linda, CA). The tissue sections were rinsed gently in the washing buffer and placed in a buffer bath. A DAB chromogen was employed for assessing the tissue sections and then incubated for 5 min. The sections were then dipped in weak ammonia (0.037 M/L) for 10 times, rinsed with distilled water and cover slipped. Brown stains were considered as positive immunohistochemical.
