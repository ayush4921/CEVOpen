<p>The wound tissues were isolated as previously reported and RNA was extracted applying a standard TRIZOL procedure as reported by Farahpour et al. (2018), and assessed by spectrophotometer (260 nm and 260/280 = 1.8–2.0). To prepare the cDNA, it was put in a reaction being mixed with 1 µg RNA, oligo (dT) primer (1 µL), 5 × reaction buffer (4 µL), RNAse inhibitor (1 µL), 10 mM dNTP mix (2 µL) and M-MuLV Reverse Transcriptase (1 µL) as described by producer protocol (Fermentas, GmbH, Germany). Time and temperature were as reported by Farahpour et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT6612" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). The used primers included IL-1β, forward (5′-AAC AAA CCC TGC AGT GGT TCG-3′) and reverse (5′-AGCTGCTTCAGACACTTGCAC-3′); TGF-β, forward (5-CCAAACGCCGAAGACTTATCC-3′) and reverse (5′-CTTATTACCGATGGGATGGGATAGCCC-3′); IL-10, forward (5′-GAAGCTCCCTCAGCGAGGACA-3′) and reverse (5′-TTGGGCCAGTGAGTGAAAGGG-3′), TNF-α, forward (5′-GAAGCTCCCTCAGCGAGGACA-3′) and reverse (5′-TTGGGCCAGTGAGTGAAAGGG-3′), FGF-2, forward (5′-GGAACCCGGCGGGACACGGAC-3′) and reverse (5′-CCGCTGTGGCAGCTCTTG GGG-3′); VEGF, forward (5′-GCTCCGTAGTAGCCGTGGTCT-3′) and reverse (5′-GGAACCCGGCGGGACACGGAC-3′), and IGF-1, forward (5′-TAGGTGGTTGATGAATGGT-3′) and reverse (5′-GAAAGGGCAGGGCTAAT-3′).
