<p id="Par12">To check the effect of EO treatment on gut enzymes, gut regions of control and treated larvae were homogenized in PBS (pH 7.4) then centrifuged as described above in protein assay. The supernatant obtained was subjected to different enzyme assays such as α-amylase, α- as well as β-glucosidase activities. The α-amylase activity was carried out by dinitrosalicylic acid (DNSA) procedure [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Briefly, 20 µL of the enzyme extract, in 50 µL of universal buffer (pH 7.4) was mixed with 25 µL of soluble starch (1%, w/v). The reaction mixture was incubated at 35 °C for 30 min followed by the addition of 85 µL DNSA reagent and heated in a boiling water bath for 10 min to terminate the reaction. After cooling the reaction mixtures on ice, absorbances were measured spectrophotometrically at 540 nm.
