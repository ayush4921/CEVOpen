<p id="Par9">The attractant/repellent assays were carried out by double choice method [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] where 20 individuals of newly emerged adult flies were released in a cage containing 2 conical flasks. One flask contained 0.1% test oil in 5 mL (v/v) of milk, while the other contained acetone as solvent with 5 mL of milk to serve as a control. The EO containing conical flask was fitted with a funnel (10 cm diameter) outwards to avoid the escape of the flies (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d). The number of flies attracted toward test oils, and solvent only in control flask were recorded after 24 h of treatment, and the percent (%) repellency was determined by using the formula;
