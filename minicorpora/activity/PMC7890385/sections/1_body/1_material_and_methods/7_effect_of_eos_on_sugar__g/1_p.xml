<p id="Par11">To determine the effect caused by EO treatment on the larval body, 3rd instar larvae (
 <italic>n</italic> = 10) were exposed to LC
 <sub>50</sub> concentrations of test oils for 24 h. After treatment, the larvae were sacrificed to estimate the biochemical components like total sugar, glycogen and lipid contents. The body contents were homogenized in 0.2 mL Sodium sulfate solution (w/v) followed by addition of 0.8 mL methanol in chloroform (1:1, v/v). The homogenized mixture was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 2 min, and the supernatant was harvested for glycogen estimation by Anthrone method [

 <sub>2</sub>O and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 2 min to observe the formation of 2 layers. The upper aqueous layer was used for sugar analysis by the method of Van Handel and Day [

 <sub>4</sub> then heated for 10 min at 90 °C. The color change caused by the addition of 5 mL Vanillin reagent was measured at 625 nm spectrophotometrically (Carry 60, Agilent technologies, USA). For sugar and glycogen content, glucose was used as standard whereas Soybean oil was used in case of lipids. The total body proteins were determined by Bradford assay [

The biochemical components under consideration were determined in terms of micrograms (µg)/larva, derived from the standards. These tests were repeated at least 5 times to get the constant results.
