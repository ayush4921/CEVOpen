<p id="Par6">The culture of housefly, 
 <italic>M. domestica</italic> procured from the national chemical laboratory (NCL), Pune (M.S.), India, was maintained at 28 ± 2 °C and 60–70% R.H. for several generations in plastic jars of 35 × 15 cm dimension as described previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The jars were covered with muslin cloth to prevent the flies from escape. The adult flies were fed 
 <italic>ad libitum</italic> on 10% milk solution (w/v) offered through a cotton swab which served dual purpose for food as well as substratum for oviposition. The food was changed regularly to prevent the contamination by microorganisms. The rod-shaped eggs laid in batches were whitish in color and approximately 1.2 mm in size (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). The eggs after oviposition were stored in different sets of jars for hatching. The newly hatched larvae, creamy whitish in color (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b) were fed on milk solution. The first to third larval instars were identified on the basis of size of the larva and time after hatching by following the descriptions of Hussein and Capinera [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The collected pupae were kept separate for emergence into adult. Finally, the freshly emerged adults were also used for various bioassays.
