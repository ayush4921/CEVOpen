<p id="Par26">Plants serve as a reservoir for many active compounds with distinguished properties which attributes to their commercial value. The EOs extracted from plants with characteristic aroma are composites of oxygenated terpenes, hydrocarbons and sesquiterpenes, which impart special economical significance to these secondary metabolites. Since EOs differ in their chemical composition therefore, characterization becomes an important process to decipher their different chemotypes. The GC-MS is an ideal technique for the qualitative and quantitative determination of volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds in EOs. These components in EO are frequently identified by comparison of their unique retention indices and characteristic mass spectra.</p>
