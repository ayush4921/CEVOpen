<p id="Par27">The GC-MS analysis of the LGEO revealed 12 major compounds which show the highest mass spectra ratios (Fig. S1). The major components present in the oil were Citral (37.48%) followed by Geranyl methanoate (26.88%), acetone (10.66%) and cyclobutane (4.58%) (Table S1). In case of TTEO, we observed 5 major compounds such as Terpinen-4-ol (45.78%) &gt; γ-terpinene (16.52%), &gt; 4-carene (8.75%), &gt; β-Cymene (7.98%) followed by the least proportion of α-Terpineol (4.48%). Lemongrass is generally known to contain citral as a major component which is a complex of bioactive isomers like neral and geranial. Huynh, [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] reported that citral also known as 3, 7-dimethyl-2, 6-octadienal is a natural mixture of isomeric acyclic monoterpene aldehydes, i.e., geranial (transcitral, citral A) and neral (cis-citral, citral B). However, earlier researchers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] have stated that TTEO contains 3 major constituents such as 4-terpineol, γ-terpinene and α- terpinene, the distribution and abundance of these constituents in EOs depends on many factors such as genetic variations and geographical conditions of the plant species.
