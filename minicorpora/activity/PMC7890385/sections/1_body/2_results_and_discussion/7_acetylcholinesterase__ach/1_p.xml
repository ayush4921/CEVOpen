<p id="Par25">The neurotransmitter AChE is pivotal for insects and higher animals. It plays a prominent role in cholinergic synapse in insects. The AChE elucidates the neurogenic toxicity of chemicals on insects, and in this study, it was observed that tested EOs displayed significant effect on acetylcholinesterase activity. Among the compounds, LGEO affected the neurotransmission by the inhibition of AChE activity to a greater extent (0.00288 ± 0.0002 U/mg of Protein) followed by tea tree (0.00785 ± 0.0005 U/mg of Protein) as compared to normal larvae (0.01134 ± 0.0003 U/mg of protein). The inhibition of AChE is largely imparted by the presence of monoterpenes present in aromatic compounds like EOs [
