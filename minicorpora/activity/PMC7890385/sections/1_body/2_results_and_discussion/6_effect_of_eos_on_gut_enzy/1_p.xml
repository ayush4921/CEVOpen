<p id="Par24">The gut enzymes are key players for digestive physiology and health of all animals. Since house flies commonly dwell on sugary foods, their digestion mostly depends on amylases and glucosidases. Therefore, we determined the effect of EO on amylase and glucosidase activities in house fly larvae. Since some EOs are known to alter the digestive physiology of the insects, we investigated the effect of tested compounds on house fly larvae. However, we observed a significant difference in amylase activity between control and treated sets. The α-amylase activity was drastically reduced from 0.21 to 0.074 ± 0.001 U/mg protein and 0.1064 ± 0.004 U/mg protein (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Similarly, a considerable reduction of α- and β-glucosidase activities were observed after treatment with EOs. In α-glucosidase activity, LGEO proved to be more effective with a reasonable reduction from 2.45 U/mg of protein to 1.95 ± 0.03 U/mg of protein followed by TTEO (2.37 ± 0.07 U/mg of protein). However, in β-glucosidase activity, LG showed a higher effect, better than TTEO. The β-glucosidase activity was decreased from 3.06 ± 0.07 U/mg of protein in control larvae to 2.65 ± 0.04 U/mg of protein by LG and 2.75 ± 0.02 U/mg of protein with TTEO. According to Mehrabadi et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], if the action of the amylases is inhibited, it causes energy shortness, and ultimately death of the organism which supports our observations of larvicidal bioassay. The inhibition of α-amylase activity in the treated larvae could be a cytotoxic effect on epithelial cells of the insect midgut which synthesizes it. Further, the authors suggested that treatment with EO causes lysis of cell wall, damages cytoplasm and affects lipid and protein contents [
