<p id="Par29">During the last few decades, numerous studies have tested the efficacy of plant-based formulations against mosquitoes which is largely lacking in case of house flies. Taking into consideration, we determined the effect of LG and TTEOs on different forms of 
 <italic>M. domestica</italic>. As evident from the observations, LG and TT oils showed potential bioefficacy against different life stages of the housefly. Since LG and TTEOs significantly reduced the metabolic contents and inhibited the enzymes like AChE, Î±-amylase, etc. the present study signposts the insecticidal repertoire of tested compounds for the sustainable management of houseflies. The inhibition of pupal emergence into adults together with larvicidal and adulticidal effects also suggest the formulation of these botanicals for potential industrial applications. The tested oils can thus be easily formulated as microemulsions or nanoemulsions in water or eco-friendly solvent systems. The microemulsions are known to enhance bioefficacy and provide long-term stability to the botanicals. Being volatile, the EOs can also be dissolved in solvents and kept at desired places inside buildings whereby they function as strong repellents for houseflies. In conclusion, LG and TTEOs could prove as important candidates for pest control strategy against houseflies due to their intrinsic larvicidal, pupicidal and adulticidal properties while LG may also act as an effective repellent and ovipositional deterrent for closely related species. However, for field trials and formulation of tested EOs a comprehensive understanding of their mechanism of action on model insect becomes imperative to avert the effects on non-target fauna. Therefore, our future perspective will be to characterize the transcriptome of 
 <italic>M. domestica</italic> in response to EO treatment to better understand the mechanisms associated with their insecticidal activities.
