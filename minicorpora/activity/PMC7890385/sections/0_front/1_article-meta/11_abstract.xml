  <p id="Par1">The management of house fly, 
   <italic>Musca domestica</italic> has become immensely important to prevent epidemics of many detrimental diseases. In view of this objective, the present study demonstrates the efficacy of lemongrass (LG) and tea tree essential oils (TTEOs) against 
   <italic>M. domestica</italic>. The TTEO proved to be more lethal against larvae and adults of 
   <italic>M. domestica</italic> depicting an LC
   <sub>50</sub> at 14.88 mg/ dm
   <sup>3</sup> which was 17.19 mg/ dm
   <sup>3</sup> for LGEO. In contrast, pupicidal effect of LGEO was much higher (LD
   <sub>50</sub>, 14.49 µl/0.25L) as compared to TTEO. The LGEO drastically reduced the total body sugar, glycogen and protein contents by 3.29, 2.95 and 7.56 fold, respectively, contrasting with high influence of TTEO on lipid content of the late 3rd instar larvae. A considerable reduction in gut enzymes secretion was observed due to treatment of EOs thereby altering gut physiology of the insect. Moreover, significant inhibition of acetylcholine esterase (AchE) was also observed with LGEO at LC
   <sub>50</sub> concentration (5.33 mg/ml) inhibiting insect neurotransmission. The gas chromatography-mass spectrometric (GC-MS) analysis of the LGEO showed 12 major compounds dominated by Citral whereas TTEO contained only 5 major compounds. Further analysis by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) revealed distortion and shrinkage of larval bodies caused by the treatment of EOs. These overall observations brand LG and TT-EOs as potential organic-insecticides against 
   <italic>M. domestica</italic>.
