0: The aim of this study was to determine, first, the chemical composition of   Aloysia polystachya (Griseb) Moldenke essential oil, from leaves harvested in central Chile; and second, its antioxidant and cytotoxic activity.
1: Eight compounds were identified via gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GCMS) analyses, with the most representative being   R-carvone (91.03%),   R-limonene (4.10%), and dihydrocarvone (1.07%).
2: For   Aloysia polystachya essential oil, antioxidant assays (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), H  2O  2, ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), and total reactive antioxidant potential (TRAP)) showed good antioxidant activity compared to commercial antioxidant controls; and anti-proliferative assays against three human cancer cell lines (colon, HT-29; prostate, PC-3; and breast, MCF-7) determined an IC  50 of 5.85, 6.74, and 9.53 g/mL, and selectivity indices of 4.75, 4.12, and 2.92 for HT-29, PC-3, and MCF-7, respectively.
3: We also report on assays with CCD 841 CoN (colon epithelial).
4: Overall, results from this study may represent, in the near future, developments for natural-based cancer treatments.
