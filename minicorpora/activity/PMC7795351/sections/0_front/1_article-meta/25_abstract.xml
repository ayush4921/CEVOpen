 <p>The aim of this study was to determine, first, the chemical composition of 
  <italic>Aloysia polystachya</italic> (Griseb) Moldenke essential oil, from leaves harvested in central Chile; and second, its antioxidant and cytotoxic activity. Eight compounds were identified via gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) analyses, with the most representative being 
  <italic>R</italic>-carvone (91.03%), 
  <italic>R</italic>-limonene (4.10%), and dihydrocarvone (1.07%). For 
  <italic>Aloysia polystachya</italic> essential oil, antioxidant assays (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), H
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>2</sub>, ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), and total reactive antioxidant potential (TRAP)) showed good antioxidant activity compared to commercial antioxidant controls; and anti-proliferative assays against three human cancer cell lines (colon, HT-29; prostate, PC-3; and breast, MCF-7) determined an IC
  <sub>50</sub> of 5.85, 6.74, and 9.53 µg/mL, and selectivity indices of 4.75, 4.12, and 2.92 for HT-29, PC-3, and MCF-7, respectively. We also report on assays with CCD 841 CoN (colon epithelial). Overall, results from this study may represent, in the near future, developments for natural-based cancer treatments.
