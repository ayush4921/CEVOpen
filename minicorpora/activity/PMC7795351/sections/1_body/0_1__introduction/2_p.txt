1: There are four reports from Argentina and one from Brazil where the chemical composition of the oils has been determined.
2: Of the plants that grow in Argentina, the main constituents of the oils of the leaves of the species collected in the province of Cordova have been described as the monoterpenes -tujone (83.56%), sabinene (4.61%), and limonene (1.62%) [ 10, 11], while in species collected in the cities of Buenos Aires and Corrientes the predominant monoterpenes are carvone (83.584.4%), limonene (14.216.5%), and verbenone (1.58%) [ 12, 13].
3: The essential oil from  A. polystachya leaves grown in the southeast region of Brazil revealed a high content of carvone (80.71%) and limonene (14.65%) [ 14].
4: In addition, these studies validated the antimicrobial activity of  A. polystachya oils against different human pathogens [ 10, 11, 12, 13, 14].
