<p>Nevertheless, there are few reports in the literature concerning the biological properties of essential oil from this plant. There are four reports from Argentina and one from Brazil where the chemical composition of the oils has been determined. Of the plants that grow in Argentina, the main constituents of the oils of the leaves of the species collected in the province of Cordova have been described as the monoterpenes α-tujone (83.56%), sabinene (4.61%), and limonene (1.62%) [

 <xref rid="B11-molecules-26-00131" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], while in species collected in the cities of Buenos Aires and Corrientes the predominant monoterpenes are carvone (83.5–84.4%), limonene (14.2–16.5%), and verbenone (1.58%) [
