<p>Based on criteria established by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Plant Screening Program, a crude extract of a medicinal plant is considered to have potential if the in vitro cytotoxicity studies reported an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of less than 20 µg/mL following incubation of 48–72 h [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-26-00131" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In the present study, the oil showed pronounced effects against HT-29 (colon), PC-3 (prostate), and MCF-7 (breast), with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 5.85 ± 0.39, 6.74 ± 0.03, and 9.53 ± 0.45 µg/mL, respectively, results which are consistent with NCI guidelines. Notably, these were significantly lower than the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value obtained for normal cell line, 27.81 ± 0.21 µg/mL. Moreover, 
 <italic>A. polystachya</italic> oil cytotoxic activity was much higher than 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in all cell lines tested, although lower than daunorubicin against breast and prostate cell lines. Nevertheless, these results—which are supported by previous in vivo assays of alcohol extracts of this plant [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-26-00131" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]—demonstrate the anti-proliferative potential of this species, and particularly so against the colon tumor cell line. Furthermore, essential oils with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values under 30 µg/mL are typically classified as promising anti-cancer agents [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-26-00131" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This report is therefore indicative that 
 <italic>A. polystachya</italic> oil may be a potential substrate for the development of new drugs against this disease.
