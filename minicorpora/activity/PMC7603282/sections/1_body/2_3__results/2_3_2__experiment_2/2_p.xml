<p>Increasing SA inclusion linearly increased IVDMD (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) and butyrate concentration (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) of BGH, whereas the IVNDFD (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) exhibited a quadratic pattern with the highest value occurring for the 10 mg/kg level. Acetate concentration (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) also had quadratic pattern, with the lowest value at the 1 mg/kg level. Concentrations of total SCFA (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), isobutyrate (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), and isovalerate (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) increased in a quadratic manner with the highest values at the 1 mg/kg level. In addition, A:P ratio showed a quadratic pattern with increasing SA level, with the lowest value occurring with the 1 mg/kg dose.
