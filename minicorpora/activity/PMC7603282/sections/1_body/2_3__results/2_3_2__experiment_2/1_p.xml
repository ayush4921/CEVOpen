<p>The SA wormwood was selected for the examination of its optimal inclusion level in Experiment 2 because it was more effective at improving rumen fermentation and increasing fibrolytic bacteria populations than GA and IN when applied at 5 mg/kg per 40 mL of buffered rumen fluid in Experiment 1. As the SA inclusion level increased, the IVDMD (0.05 &lt; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.10) and ammonia-N concentration (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) of SBM followed quadratic and cubic patterns, respectively, with the 0.1 mg/kg level giving the highest value (

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), isovalerate (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), and acetate to propionate (A:P) ratio (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) increased linearly with increasing SA inclusion, but propionate concentration (
