<p>As in Experiment 1, increasing the level of inclusion of SA influenced rumen fermentation [
 <xref rid="B31-microorganisms-08-01605" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The application of SA at 0.1 mg/kg to the SBM substrate tended to produce a higher IVDMD without any negative effects on the SCFA profile and gave the highest ammonia-N concentration. This study, therefore, supported the use of this level (0.1 mg/kg) to improve IVDMD [
 <xref rid="B32-microorganisms-08-01605" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The application of SA at 10 mg/kg to SBM increased total SCFA concentration but reduced IVDMD. This reduction in IVDMD might have been due to the inhibition of microbial growth by the high level of EO supplied, even though no effects on the fibrolytic bacteria studies were evident. Other studies have shown that an appropriate dose of EO can increase the fermentation of substrates in the rumen, whereas excessive doses can decrease rumen fermentation [

 <xref rid="B33-microorganisms-08-01605" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. For instance, Busquet et al. [
 <xref rid="B23-microorganisms-08-01605" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] reported that adding plant extract EO at 3–300 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup> to a mixed substrate (1:1 ratio of forage and concentrate) increased total SCFA and ammonia-N concentration, but they were decreased by applying EO at 3000 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup>. Likewise, Castillejos et al. [
 <xref rid="B24-microorganisms-08-01605" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] reported that adding various EO at 5–500 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup> to a mixture of forage and concentrate (60:40 ratio) increased concentrations of total SCFA and ammonia, but these were reduced at a high dose of 5000 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup>. More research is needed to understand specific reasons and mechanisms by which high doses of EO inhibit rumen fermentation.
