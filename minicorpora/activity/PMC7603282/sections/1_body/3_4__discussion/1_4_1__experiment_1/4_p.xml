<p>The IN wormwood contained similar major active compounds (Camphor and 1-Borneol) as that of wormwood hay (

 <xref rid="B8-microorganisms-08-01605" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Substitution of rice straw with wormwood hay containing Camphor and 1-Borneol in sheep diets has increased total ammonia-N and total SCFA of ruminal fermentation relative to the control diet within 2 h of feeding, but the difference is no longer evident after 8 h of feeding [
