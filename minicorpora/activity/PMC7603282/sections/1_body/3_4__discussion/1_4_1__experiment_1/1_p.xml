<p>Application of IN and SA had no effects on rumen fermentation and nutrient digestibility of SBM substrate but increased IVDMD of BGH substrate. Ruminal pH and total SCFA concentration in the present study were similar to the previous studies [

 <xref rid="B24-microorganisms-08-01605" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The GA decreased total SCFA concentration resulting from the fermentation of both substrates and decreased also IVDNDF of the BGH substrate. The IVNDFD of the SBM substrate was 100% in the present study because SBM was totally degraded in the ruminal fluid due to its low concentration of NDF. Similar to the increase in IVDMD of BGH by IN and SA, Kim et al. [
