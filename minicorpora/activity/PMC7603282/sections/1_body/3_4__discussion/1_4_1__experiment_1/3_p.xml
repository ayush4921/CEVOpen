<p>As for IN and SA in the present study, previous studies have reported the potential for EO from lemongrass oil, cinnamon oil, or clove oil to improve nutrient digestibility and rumen fermentation [

 <xref rid="B6-microorganisms-08-01605" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] also applied a mixture of medical plants, including wormwood, in an in vitro study and improved ammonia-N and total SCFA concentrations, as found for IN and SA in the present study. However, other studies have also reported a similar result to that from GA, which reduced the digestibility of BGH and fermentation of both substrates [

 <xref rid="B25-microorganisms-08-01605" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-microorganisms-08-01605" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The GA contained Petan-1,3-diodiisobutyrate as the active compound with the highest concentration, whereas IN and SA did not contain this compound. No study has examined the effects of pure Petan-1,3-diodiisobutyrate on rumen fermentation. However, based on its high concentration in GA and the negative effect GA had on in vitro digestibility, it is assumed that Petan-1,3-diodiisobutyrate has an inhibitory or negative effect on rumen fermentation.
