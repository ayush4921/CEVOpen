0: Interest in alternative feed additives has increased over the last few decades since many countries, including the European Union and the United States of America, imposed mandatory or voluntary restrictions on the use of antibiotics for animal production due to adverse effects on human health.
1: Essential oils (EO), which have antimicrobial and antioxidant activity, have been studied extensively as feed additives to replace antibiotics in livestock diets.
2: In general, EO can modify ruminal microbial fermentation and improve ruminant performance [ 1].
3: The EO is composed of secondary plant metabolites with different active compounds and concentrations depending on the source [ 2].
4: Application of EO as feed additives has varied effects on rumen fermentation.
5: For example, the application of EO from lemongrass oil has improved nutrient digestibility in the rumen [ 3].
6: Other sources of EO, such as oregano, thyme, and sweet orange, have been reported to have no effect on nutrient digestibility, ammonia-N, and total short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) of the rumen according to Benchaar et al.
7: [ 4], but they had beneficial effects on rumen fermentation according to Calsamiglia et al.
8: [ 1].
9: In addition, the application of herbal mixtures as EO sources has improved nutrient digestibility and total SCFA concentration but is less effective at reducing methane emission [ 5].
10: Furthermore, the application of a mixture of medical plants (wormwood ( Artemisia absinthium L.), chamomile ( Matricaria chamomilla L.), fumitory ( Fumaria officinalis L.), and mallow ( Malva sylvestris L.)) as EO sources has decreased ammonia-N and methane concentration in vitro [ 6].
