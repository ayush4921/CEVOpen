 <p>This study investigated the effects of essential oil (EO) from three Korean wormwood (
  <italic>Artemisia Montana</italic>) plants on in vitro ruminal digestibility, fermentation, and microbial diversity. Dried (0.5 g) soybean meal (SBM) or bermudagrass hay (BGH) were incubated in buffered rumen fluid (40 mL) for 72 h with or without EO (5 mg/kg) from Ganghwa (GA), Injin (IN), or San (SA) wormwood (Experiment 1). Both SA and IN improved (
  <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) dry matter digestibility (DMD) of BGH, while GA reduced (
  <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) total short-chain fatty acid of BGH and SBM. Besides, SA increased (
  <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) numbers of 
  <italic>Ruminococcus albus</italic> and 
  <italic>Streptococcus bovis</italic> in SBM. Experiment 2 examined different doses (0, 0.1, 1, and 10 mg/kg) of SA, the most promising EO from Experiment 1. Applying SA at 10 mg/kg gave the highest DMD (L; 
  <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) and neutral detergent fiber (Q; 
  <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) digestibility for BGH. Applying SA at 1 mg/kg gave the highest 
  <italic>R. albus</italic> population (Q; 
  <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in SBM. Therefore, SA was better than GA and IN at improving rumen fermentation, and the 0.1 to 1 and 10 mg/kg doses improved ruminal fermentation and in vitro digestibility of SBM and BGH, respectively.
