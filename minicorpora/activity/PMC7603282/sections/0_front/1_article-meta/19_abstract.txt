0: This study investigated the effects of essential oil (EO) from three Korean wormwood (  Artemisia Montana) plants on in vitro ruminal digestibility, fermentation, and microbial diversity.
1: Dried (0.5 g) soybean meal (SBM) or bermudagrass hay (BGH) were incubated in buffered rumen fluid (40 mL) for 72 h with or without EO (5 mg/kg) from Ganghwa (GA), Injin (IN), or San (SA) wormwood (Experiment 1).
2: Both SA and IN improved (  p< 0.05) dry matter digestibility (DMD) of BGH, while GA reduced (  p< 0.05) total short-chain fatty acid of BGH and SBM.
3: Besides, SA increased (  p< 0.05) numbers of   Ruminococcus albus and   Streptococcus bovis in SBM.
4: Experiment 2 examined different doses (0, 0.1, 1, and 10 mg/kg) of SA, the most promising EO from Experiment 1.
5: Applying SA at 10 mg/kg gave the highest DMD (L;   p< 0.01) and neutral detergent fiber (Q;   p< 0.05) digestibility for BGH.
6: Applying SA at 1 mg/kg gave the highest   R. albus population (Q;   p< 0.05) in SBM.
7: Therefore, SA was better than GA and IN at improving rumen fermentation, and the 0.1 to 1 and 10 mg/kg doses improved ruminal fermentation and in vitro digestibility of SBM and BGH, respectively.
