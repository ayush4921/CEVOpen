 <caption> Effects of applying essentials oil from San wormwood at increasing levels to SBM ( A) or BGH ( B) substrates on fold changes of rumen microbial populations compared to that of the blank after 72 h of in vitro incubation in buffered rumen fluid. The San essential oil was applied at 0, 0.1, 1, and 1 mg/kg per 40 mL of buffered rumen fluid. The p-value indicated the polynomial contrast analysis; L, Linear effect; Q, Quadratic effect; C, Cubic effect. aâ€“c: Means for the same microbe with different letters differ significantly ( p &lt; 0.05). </caption>
