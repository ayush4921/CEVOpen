<p>Aqueous or ethanol extract of

 <xref rid="B63-antioxidants-10-00073" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. In this context, ethanolic extract of sumac fruits showed robust concentration-dependent antimicrobial activity with a broad spectrum for all tested bacterial strains, which included both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. 
 <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> showed the most sensitivity toward sumac fruitâ€™s ethanolic extract, with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of &lt;0.78%. This is addition to a similar inhibitory capacity of ethanolic extracts of ripe and unripe fruits of sumac against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria strains such as 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic>, 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Proteus vulgaris</italic>, 
 <italic>Shigella dysentariae</italic>,
