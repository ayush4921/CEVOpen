<p>Al-Marazeeq et al. tested the effect of water sumac fruit extract on the production of wheat pan bread. They showed that sumac extract improved in concentration-dependent manner the quality characteristics of the pan bread [

More recently, a similar study by Dziki et al. showed that wheat bread enriched with sumac flour extracted from sumac fruit also improved the quality of the bread evaluated by a decrease in the bread volume, lightness and yellowness of crumb and increase in the redness of the bread [
