0: There are numerous trials underway to find treatment for the COVID-19 through testing vaccines as well as existing drugs.
1: Apart from the many synthetic chemical compounds, plant-based compounds could provide an array of \suitable candidates for testing against the virus.
2: Studies have confirmed the role of many plants against respiratory viruses when employed either as crude extracts or their active ingredients in pure form.
3: The purpose of this review article is to highlight the importance of phytomedicine against COVID-19.
4: The main aim is to review the mechanistic aspects of most important phytochemical compounds that have showed potential against coronaviruses.
5: Glycyrrhizin from the roots of   Glycyrrhiza glabra has shown promising potential against the previously epidemic coronavirus, SARS-CoV.
6: Other important plants such as   Artemisia annua,   Isatis indigotica, Lindera aggregate,   Pelargonium sidoides, and   Glychirrhiza spp.
7: have been employed against SARS-CoV.
8: Active ingredients (e.g.
9: emodin, reserpine, aescin, myricetin, scutellarin, apigenin, luteolin, and betulonic acid) have shown promising results against the coronaviruses.
10: Phytochemicals have demonstrated activity against the coronaviruses through mechanisms such as viral entry inhibition, inhibition of replication enzymes and virus release blockage.
11: However, compared to synthetic drugs, phytomedicine are mechanistically less understood and should be properly evaluated before application.
12: Nonetheless, phytochemicals reduce the tedious job of drug discovery and provide a less time-consuming alternative for drug testing.
13: Therefore, along with other drugs currently tested against COVID-19, plant-based drugs should be included for speedy development of COVID-19 treatment.
