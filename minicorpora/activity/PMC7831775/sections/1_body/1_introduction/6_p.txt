0: Apart from a primary food source, plants serve as a very important source of medicine.
1: A thorough understanding of the pathways of plant's secondary metabolism along with their conservation status, ecology and ethnobotany is important for drug development ( Nature 2020).
2: To focus on this aspect, medicinal plants produce many important chemical compounds through their secondary metabolism, operating as a self-defense against stress induced by environmental triggers and pathogens.
3: From using the raw plant to extraction of important compounds, medicinal plants are centuries old source in the various traditional herbal medicine systems.
4: For instance, their importance lies in the fact that the WHO concludes that 80% of the world population relies on them for treatment ( Bannerman et al., 1983).
5: It has been seen that there is a plethora of medicinal plants already employed against respiratory viruses.
6: For instance, the trials on Traditional Chinese Medicine including that of extracts from the dried fruit of  Forsythiae fructus are ongoing as a part of the world's race to develop effective treatment for COVID-19 ( Maxmen 2020).
7: Therefore, it is no wonder that medicinal plants could be employed as a potent weapon against COVID-19.
8: Traditional herbal medicine coming from these medicinal plants could serve at different fronts including alleviation of symptoms of COVID-19 patients as well as providing raw material for potent antiviral drugs.
9: The current research for treatment of COVID-19 should, therefore, include on a largescale, medicinal plants as an important area of search.
10: This review paper highlights the usefulness of medicinal plants in the fight against COVID-19 in many ways.
11: The paper reviews the important plant derived compounds for immediate application in alleviation of symptoms, and important secondary metabolites as candidates for anti- COVID-19 drug discovery.
