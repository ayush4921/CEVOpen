<p id="p0120">Furthermore, leaves of 
 <italic>Alstonia scholaris</italic> were used by 
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Channa et al. (2005)</xref> for their effect on asthma in rats and guinea pigs. The study recorded prostaglandin mediated broncho-vasodilatory activity of leaf extracts of 
 <italic>A. scholaris</italic>. It was observed from the findings that the root extract of 
 <italic>A. scholaris</italic> relaxes the calcium chloride induced contraction in guinea-pigs ileum and thus it was inferred that the extract interferes the influx of calcium ions into cells. Similarly, 
 <xref rid="bib118" ref-type="bibr">Shah et al. (2011)</xref> reported that aerial parts of the 
 <italic>Artemisia maritima</italic> showed potent anti-asthmatic activities through bronchodilation. They suggested that the bronchodilation might have been mediated through blockade of calcium channels and phosphodiesterase. Furthermore, different medicinal plants are traditionally employed for treating breathing problems. For instance, 
 <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">Kapoor et al. (2011)</xref> used leaves extracts of 
 <italic>Ficus religiosa</italic> to demonstrate the reduction of histamine &amp; acetylcholine induced pre-convulsive dyspnea (shortness of breath) in guinea pigs. This implies that careful evaluation of important herbs backed by scientific experiments could prove helpful in finding naturally existing, biocompatible solution for alleviation of respiratory problems in COVID-19 patients.
