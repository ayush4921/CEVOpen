<p id="Par11">In accordance with the completion of the classification process, the CNN algorithm show high accuracy for the training and testing processes. This is due to its capabilities in dealing with the huge number of data and focusing on the high impact features in the dataset. Thus, the biological activity prediction model has been built based on the CNN proposed algorithm. The overall accuracy for predicting the biological activities for previously unknown Egyptian essential oils components has been recorded as approximately 97%. The concluded metrics values and the discrimination outcomes of the proposed CNN prediction model are reported in Tables
