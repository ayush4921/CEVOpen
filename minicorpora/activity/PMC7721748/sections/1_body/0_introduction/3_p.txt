0: Generally, the bioactivity of the EO-producing plant depends on the chemical structure and EOs content, which determine the overall bioactivity of such plant.
1: EOs are, in fact, composed of different combinations of low nuclear weight natural blends with complete organic locomotion.
2: According to their structure, these dynamic blends can be categorized into some significant pools (e.g.
3: hydrocarbons, oxygenated mixtures, and sulfur or conceivably nitrogen).
4: These mixes pools are the mystery key for the biological activity of each EO 3.
