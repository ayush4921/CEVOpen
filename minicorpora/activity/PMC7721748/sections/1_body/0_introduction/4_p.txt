0: The biological activities of the EOs may include antiseptics, antimicrobials, antifungals, antioxidant, antitumor, antivirals, and/or anti-inflammatories.
1: Moreover, these activities vary according to the chemical constitution, which may differ from plant to another according to their geographic location, agriculture conditions, climatic or seasonal changes 4.
2: Noteworthy, the evaluation of the EOs' bioactivities cannot be constantly credited to one single compound in the EOs mixture.
3: The genuine connections between the EOs cocktail and its biological activities are highly non-linear, especially when considered across variable pools of chemical structures.
4: Hence, reliance on traditional techniques in predicting the biological impact for such activity data with this variety of structures is a troublesome issue 5.
5: Therefore, developing a deep learning-based computational model to categorize and predict the biological activities of EOs-producing plants based on their chemical constructions variations, without recourse to in-vitro experiments, could save time and cost.
