0: Recently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become one of the vigorous science that infiltrated a huge number of modern life issues such as chemical engineering, water treatment, and biological domain like genomic and proteomic studies which are especially characterized by complicated and non-linear processes 1.
1: Deep learning is one of the most promising branches of artificial intelligence with proven power in taking the raw features extracted from the extremely large data sets, such as the data produced from genomics, chemistry, and pharmaceutical laboratories.
2: Processing these data result in inferred patterns and training process-based predictive models 2.
