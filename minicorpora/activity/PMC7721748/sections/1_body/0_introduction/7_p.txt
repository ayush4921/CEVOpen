0: This study seeks to classify and predict the biological activities of the Egyptian essential oil-producing plants based on their EOs content as an experimental case study.
1: The classification is implemented based on two algorithms: Multiclass Neural Network (MNN) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to evaluate the efficiency of both machine and deep learning techniques.
2: The effective algorithm is adopted in developing a biological activity prediction model EOs-producing cases cultivated in Egypt.
3: The research skills in this study are organized as follow; first, presenting the results obtained from implementing the two algorithms; MNN as a machine learning algorithm and CNN as a deep learning algorithm, when applied on the Egyptian essential oils dataset.
4: Next, these results were discussed and evaluated for the existing dataset and the new untested datasets.
5: Finally the methodologies followed in this work are discussed.
