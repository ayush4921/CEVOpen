<p>Generally, the Egyptian ecospecies showed more antimicrobial activity compared to the Saudi ecospecies, although the Egyptian ecospecies have a lower number of compounds. This difference could be ascribed to the variation in the chemical composition of the EO. The bioactivities of the EOs are directly correlated with their chemical compound compositions [

 <xref rid="B43-molecules-25-05203" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The chemical compounds of the EOs contribute to the bioactivity either individually or synergistically [

In this context, the oxygenated terpenes in the EO of Saudi ecospecies represented 65.39% of the total mass, in addition to 13.53% of other oxygenated compounds, such as hydrocarbons and aromatics. This high content of the oxygenated compounds could be attributed to the observed antimicrobial activity of
