<p>The weed 
 <italic>B. pilosa</italic> has been reported as a noxious weed in many countries and infests many crops. It is characterized by efficient seeds dispersion [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-25-05203" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The allelopathic control of the EOs from various plants was tested against this weed such as 
 <italic>Cullen plicata</italic> [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-25-05203" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], 
 <italic>Xanthium Strumarium</italic> [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-25-05203" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], and 
 <italic>Tagetes minuta</italic> [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-25-05203" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The EO from 
 <italic>C. plicata</italic> showed comparable phytotoxic activity on the germination of 
 <italic>B. pilosa</italic>, where it attained IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 49.4 µL L
 <sup>−1</sup> [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-25-05203" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The EO of 
 <italic>C. procera</italic> in the present study revealed stronger activity than those of 
 <italic>C. plicata</italic> on radicle growth and shoot growth of 
 <italic>B. pilosa</italic>.
