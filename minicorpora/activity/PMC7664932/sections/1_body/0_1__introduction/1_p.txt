0: Ever since ancient times, humans have depended on plants as sources of food and medicine [ 1].
1: Nowadays, plants are integrated as green resources of safe bioactive materials [ 2, 3].
2: Xerophytes (desert plants) are considered rich in bioactive secondary metabolites, where they metabolize these bioactive compounds as a defense strategy [ 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].
3: The medicinal functions of the natural products and secondary metabolites of wild plants are confirmed as inhibitors of many diseases and infections, as well as antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and phytotoxicity [ 9, 10, 11, 12].
4: Among the bioactive compounds, essential oils (EOs) are the characteristic components of almost all the aromatic and medicinal plants with several bioactivities [ 10, 13, 14, 15].
