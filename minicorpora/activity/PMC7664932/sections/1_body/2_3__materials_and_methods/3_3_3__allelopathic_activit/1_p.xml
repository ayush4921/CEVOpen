<p>The allelopathic activity of the EOs extracted from Egyptian and Saudi 
 <italic>C. procera</italic> samples were examined against two weeds, 
 <italic>B. pilosa</italic> and 
 <italic>D. aegyptium</italic>. The seeds of 
 <italic>B. pilosa</italic> were collected from a garden of Mansoura University, Egypt (31°02′36.5″ N 31°21′12.3″ E), while the seeds of 
 <italic>D. aegyptium</italic> were collected from a field newly reclaimed near Gamasa City, northern Egypt (31°27′05.4″ N 31°27′44.2″ E). The uniform seeds were chosen, surface sterilized with sodium hypochlorite (0.3 N), and dried. The bioassay was conducted according to Abd El-Gawad [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-25-05203" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], where serial concentrations of the EOs (25, 50, 75, and 100 µL L
 <sup>−1</sup>) were prepared using 1% Tween 
 <sup>®</sup> 80 (Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany). In a Petri plate, 20 sterilized seeds were spread over a sterilized Whatman
 <sup>®</sup> Grade 1 filter paper, and immediately 5 mL of each concentration or Tween
 <sup>®</sup>80 as a positive control. Fiver plates were performed per each treatment and the plates were sealed with Parafilm
 <sup>®</sup> tape (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and incubated in a growth chamber at 25 ± 2 °C. After 5 and 7 days of incubation for 
 <italic>B. pilosa</italic> and 
 <italic>D. aegyptium</italic>, respectively, the germinated seeds were counted and the lengths of seedling roots and shoots were measured in mm. The inhibition of seed germination, seedling root, and the seedling shoot was calculated as follows:
