0: Over the past 2030 years,   Trichophyton rubrum represented the most widespread dermatophyte with a prevalence accounting for 70% of dermatophytosis.
1: The treatment for cutaneous infections caused by   Trichophyton spp.
2: are imidazoles (ketoconazole (KTZ)) and triazoles (itraconazole (ITZ)).
3: T. rubrum can develop resistance to azoles after prolonged exposure to subinhibitory concentrations resulting in therapeutic failures and chronic infections.
4: These problems have stimulated the search for therapeutic alternatives, including essential oils, and their potential use in combination with conventional antifungals.
5: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antifungal activity of tea tree oil (TTO) (  Melaleuca alternifolia essential oil) and the main components against   T. rubrum and to assess whether TTO in association with KTZ/ITZ as reference drugs improves the antifungal activity of these drugs.
6: We used a terpinen-4-ol chemotype (35.88%) TTO, and its antifungal properties were evaluated by minimum inhibitory and minimum fungicidal concentrations in accordance with the CLSI guidelines.
7: The interaction between TTO and azoles was evaluated through the checkerboard and isobologram methods.
8: The results demonstrated both the fungicide activity of TTO on   T. rubrum and the synergism when it was used in combination with azoles.
9: Therefore, this mixture may reduce the minimum effective dose of azole required and minimize the side effects of the therapy.
10: Synergy activity offered a promise for combination topical treatment for superficial mycoses.
