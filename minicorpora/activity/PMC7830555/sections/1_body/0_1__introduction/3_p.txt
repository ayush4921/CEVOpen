0: The preferred treatment for cutaneous infections caused by  Trichophyton spp.
1: are imidazoles, such as ketoconazole (KTZ), and triazoles, such as itraconazole (ITZ), often resulting in a complete clearance of the lesions.
2: However, inappropriate prescribing, and the increased use of systemic antifungal agents in recent years are the main factors leading to the emergence of resistance to antifungal drugs (i.e., azoles) [ 6].
3: In fact, if not properly treated, dermatophytosis may become chronic, requiring oral antifungal drugs, which are often associated with side effects such as hepatotoxicity.
4: T. rubrum can develop resistance to azoles after prolonged exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of these drugs leading to therapeutic failures and to the persistence and chronicity of the infections.
5: Furthermore, complications like bacterial superinfections can occur [ 7].
