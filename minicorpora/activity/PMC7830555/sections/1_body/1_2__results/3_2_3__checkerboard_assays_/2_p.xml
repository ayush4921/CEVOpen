<p>Moreover, TTO significantly potentiated the effect of azoles in combination therapy, reducing the MIC of both of them up to 8-fold: ITZ from 0.5 to 0.06 µg/mL and KTZ from 0.25 to 0.03 µg/mL. In addition, for each one of these interactions, the MIC for TTO (MICc) was below the testing concentration (MICa) (0.135/0.27 mg/mL vs. 1.08 mg/mL): it was remarkably decreased in the mixture with ITZ compared to the KTZ combination (8-fold vs. 4-fold).</p>
