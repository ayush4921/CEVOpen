0: In this perspective article, we use Indian traditional medicine (Ayurveda) as an example, to search historic documents for evidence of biofilm-mediated infections, identify and reconstitute plant-based traditional remedies with anti-biofilm potential, and test them in the laboratory with standard biofilm assays.
1: Based on gleanings across compendia, three plant-based remedies, of  Kalanchoe pinnata (Lam.)
2: Pers.
3: ( Parnabeeja),  Ocimum tenuiflorum L. (Holy basil or  Tulsi), and  Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers.
4: (Bermuda grass or  Durva) were reconstituted in sesame oil, and whole remedies were tested for their effects on biofilm formation and eradication of pre-formed biofilms using  in vitro microtiter based biofilm assays.
5: The three plant-based remedies showed varied inhibitory effects on biomass and metabolic activity of  P. aeruginosa and  S. aureus biofilms, with sesame oil alone also showing anti-biofilm effects.
6: Notably, comparison of the effects on biofilm and planktonic growth states revealed differential effects on the two modes of growth.
7: We discuss our approach and results, and leverage them to provide insights into the considerations and challenges relevant to evaluating traditional remedies as anti-biofilm agents.
