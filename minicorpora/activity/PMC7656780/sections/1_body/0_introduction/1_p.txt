0: Biofilms are multicellular aggregates of bacteria, attached to each other or a surface, via a self-produced extracellular matrix ( Flemming et al., 2016).
1: Implicated in a range of infection states from non-healing wounds to life-threatening burn-related sepsis ( Hall-Stoodley et al., 2004;  Kennedy et al., 2010;  Chen and Wen, 2011;  Hiby et al., 2011), biofilms are notoriously tolerant to conventional antibiotics, resulting in persistent infections and limited therapeutic options ( Hiby et al., 2010;  Sun et al., 2013;  Ciofu et al., 2017;  Sharma et al., 2019).
2: Consequently, there is a concerted push to develop novel anti-biofilm agents, that will expand therapeutic options, and prolong the lifetime of current antibiotics.
3: Traditional medical practices have been recognized as valuable sources of potential new antimicrobial agents ( Yuan et al., 2016).
4: These practices employ natural products, often from plant sources, thereby providing a huge diversity of active ingredients and biological targets.
5: Further, traditional remedies are formulated using rudimentary processes that retain the crude and combined nature of the ingredients, which is possibly important for antimicrobial activity.
6: As evident, principles that guide historical medical approaches differ from that of conventional antibiotics ( Leekha et al., 2011).
7: Therefore, prospecting historical antimicrobial remedies as potential anti-biofilm agents could provide a paradigm shift in the treatment of biofilms.
