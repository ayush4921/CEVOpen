<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, in the presence of SO, KPE-SO, CDE-SO and OTE-SO, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> biofilms showed significantly decreased total biomass, when compared with untreated biofilms (UT). The reduction in the total biomass formed in the presence of sesame oil (SO) and the three traditional remedies was quantified to be 53–66%, 74–80%, 74–88% and 72–85% for KPE-SO, CDE-SO and OTE-SO respectively. This corroborates with results in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>, that shows a reduction in biofilm metabolic activity, indicating less viable cells (XTT assay), in the presence of SO, KPE-SO, CDE-SO and OTE-SO (48–66%, 75–86%, 71–79% and 49–79% reduction respectively). Our results demonstrate that SO itself has antibiofilm activity. However, the reduction in both biomass and metabolic activity in the presence of KPE-SO and CDE-SO was significant as compared to SO alone, indicating that the plant remedies had an enhanced anti-biofilm effect. For OTE-SO, the enhanced anti-biofilm activity compared to SO was seen only in the case of total biomass, and no significant difference in metabolic activity was observed.
