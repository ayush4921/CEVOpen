<p>Treatment with sesame oil, KPE-SO and CDE-SO were seen to reduce the metabolic activity of pre-formed 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> biofilms, however only KPE-SO showed an increased reduction in viable cells as compared with sesame oil alone. Similarly, a significant reduction in the viability of pre-formed 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> biofilms was seen with sesame oil, KPE-SO, CDE-SO and OTE-SO.
