<p>To test the anti-biofilm potential of reconstituted remedies we used standard microtiter-plate based biofilm assays. These are 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> laboratory-based assays, in which thin biofilms form on the bottom and sides of polystyrene wells (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Kragh et al., 2019</xref>). Inspite of these obvious limiting factors, we chose to test the remedies with these assays for several reasons. Microtiter based biofilm assays can be used to rapidly test a large number of compounds and enable semi-quantitative estimations of biomass and metabolic activity of biofilms (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Kragh et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, a recent set of technical guidelines have been published to enable consistent testing and reporting (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Allkja et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, these widely-employed assays lend well as “screening” platforms. While these assays have been used to test various natural antimicrobial compounds, they are usually single ingredients and chemical extracts; here we show that these assays can be used to test “whole” traditional remedies. It is important to consider that the medicinal preparations are in a form suitable for testing with these assays, for example, liquid preparations as opposed to a gel or cream. With these assays, the reconstituted remedies displayed differential activity on biomass formation and metabolic activity, against biofilm and planktonic states of 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, a Gram negative pathogen, and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, which is Gram positive. This highlights the value of these assays as an initial screening tool for traditional remedies. Notably, these effects were seen against planktonic cultures, pre-formed biofilms as well as on the formation of new biofilms. This underscores the importance of testing a wide range of pathogens, and planktonic vs. different biofilm states.
