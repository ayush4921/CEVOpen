<p>The antibacterial activity of hydroethanolic extracts from Greek oregano and common oregano against tested strains was also evaluated. Extracts inhibited the growth of all tested strains of bacteria, however, the MIC and MBC values were different. When regards Greek oregano extract, the MIC values were in range 2–4 mg × mL
 <sup>−1</sup> and MBC from 4 to 8 mg × mL
 <sup>−1</sup>. Such results indicate on its effective antibacterial activity. In the case of common oregano extract, visibly higher concentration was applied in order to inhibit the growth of bacteria, especially Gram-negative strains. The weakest antibacterial activity was demonstrated by common oregano extract against 
 <italic>S. enteritidis</italic> (MIC 64 mg × mL
 <sup>−1</sup> and MBC &gt; 64 mg × mL
 <sup>−1</sup>). The MIC and MBC values of those extracts against Gram-positive bacteria was in range of 4–8 mg × mL
 <sup>−1</sup> (MIC) and 8–16 mg × mL
 <sup>−1</sup> (MBC), except for 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> for which the MIC and MBC value was 32 mg × mL
 <sup>−1</sup> and 64 mg × mL
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively (

 <xref rid="B38-molecules-26-00988" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], hydroethanolic extracts obtained from 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> inhibited the growth of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa strains</italic>, while Licina et al. [
 <xref rid="B67-molecules-26-00988" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] demonstrated the antibacterial activity of such extracts against 
 <italic>Bacillus</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. However, the abovementioned studies didn’t include the identification of 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> subspecies. In general, the antibacterial activity of extracts investigated in our work may be associated with its chemical composition, especially when given phenolic acids fraction in which rosmarinic acid dominated. Visibly lower antibacterial activity of common oregano extract in comparison to Greek oregano, may be related with the absence of particular phenolic compounds such as lithospermic B and chlorogenic acids combined with the lower content of rosmarinic acid and (−)-epicatechin. These results correspond to those obtained by Sahin et al. [
 <xref rid="B76-molecules-26-00988" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] indicating that common oregano methanolic extract did not reveal antibacterial activity at all.
