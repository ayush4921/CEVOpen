 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> ATCC 7644, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCC 25923) pathogenic microorganisms, MIC and MBC was determined. Essential oils and extracts were tested against standard reference strains of bacteria related to foodborn diseases. The study involved microdilution method, which is a well-suited technique for screening of numerous combinations of antimicrobial agents in relation to different bacteria. Moreover, this method is economical in terms of time and resources [
