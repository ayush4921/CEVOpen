<p>In our study, six compounds were identified within the flavonoids group, as follows: luteolin 7-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucoside, apigenin 7-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucoside, naryngenin, isovitexin, (+)-catechin and (−)-epicatechin. Both, in Greek oregano and common oregano extracts, luteolin 7-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucoside and naryngenin were the dominant species. However, common oregano was characterized by a distinctly higher content of these substances. In turn, Greek oregano extracts were richer in (−)-epicatechin (

 <italic>O</italic>-glucoside and (+)-catechin was similar in the extracts of both subspecies, whereas isovitexin was present only in Greek oregano. The obtained results correspond well with the literature data where the domination of luteolin, apigenin and naryngenin derivatives in 
 <italic>Origanum</italic> subspecies was reported [

 <xref rid="B61-molecules-26-00988" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] many free flavones, flavonols, flavanones and dihydroflavonols have been identified within this taxon. Gonzalez et al. [
 <xref rid="B56-molecules-26-00988" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] claimed that the profile of phenolic compounds may be considered as a specific fingerprint useful in the case of authentication and/or discrimination of various 
 <italic>Origanum</italic> subspecies.
