<p>In common oregano essential oil, sabinene and 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene dominated within the monoterpene hydrocarbons group (16.41 and 10.45%, respectively). In contrast to Greek oregano, phenolics (carvacrol and thymol) were present in much smaller quantities (7.11%) in favor of the oxygenated monoterpenes (21.19%) where terpinen-4-ol represented up to 13.81%. Common oregano essential oil was rich in sesquiterpenes, especially β-caryophyllene (6.87%) and its oxide (3.39%) (

The predominance of the abovementioned compounds allows us to qualify the essential oil as a mixed sabinyl/cymyl type rich in terpinen-4-ol. According to the literature, sabinyl chemotypes are considered to be the most frequent within common oregano, while the presence of phenolic ones is rather rare [

 <xref rid="B31-molecules-26-00988" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Common oregano is characterized by higher levels of terpenic polymorphism than Greek oregano, since a lot of different chemotypes have been recognized within this subspecies, as follows: sabinene, 
 <italic>cis</italic>-sabinene hydrate, terpinen 4-ol, 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene + β-caryophyllene, germacrene
