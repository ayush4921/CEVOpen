<p>The content of essential oil in the Greek oregano herb was at a level of 2.87 g × 100 g

 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> subspecies strongly depends on its geographical origin. Greek oregano together with other southernmost subspecies (subsp. 
 <italic>glandulosum</italic> and subsp. 
 <italic>gracile</italic>) are considered to be rich in volatiles, whereas common oregano, similarly to the other subspecies originating from central part of Europe (subsp. 
 <italic>virens</italic> and subsp. 
 <italic>viride</italic>), is regarded as a rather poor source of these compounds [
