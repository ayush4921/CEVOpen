<p>Next, a series of twofold dilutions of tested essential oils and extracts in the concentration range from 64 to 0.125 mg × mL
 <sup>−1</sup> were prepared in MHB, using sterile 96-well microtiter plates (Brand, Wertheim, Germany). To each well of plates 10 µL of bacterial inoculum was added and the final concentration of bacteria suspension was about 5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> CFU × mL
 <sup>−1</sup>. The well with medium and inoculum without essential oil or extract was also prepared and served as a negative control. In turn, wells with medium and essential oils or extracts without inoculum served as positive controls. The plates with bacteria were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The MIC value was defined as the lowest essential oil/extract concentration, in which no visual growth of bacteria was noted. To determine MBC value, 10 µL of broth was taken from the well showing no bacterial growth and spot-inoculated onto plates with Müller-Hinton Agar medium. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24h. The MBC was defined as the lowest concentration of essential oil or extract, which resulted in complete reduction of bacteria. Each experiment was performed in triplicate.
