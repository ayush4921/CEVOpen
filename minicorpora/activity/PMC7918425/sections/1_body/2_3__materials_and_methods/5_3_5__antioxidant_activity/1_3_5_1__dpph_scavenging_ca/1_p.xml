<p>The measurement of the DPPH (2,2-diphenylpicrylhydrazyl hydrate) radical scavenging activity was carried out according to Yen and Chen [
 <xref rid="B81-molecules-26-00988" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>] with modifications concerning the time of reaction [
 <xref rid="B82-molecules-26-00988" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Dry hydroethanolic extract (0.25 mg) was dissolved in 1 mL of methanol (2×, 4×, 8×, 16× diluted solutions). Essential oils were also diluted in methanol (concentrations 0.20, 0.40, 0.80, 1.60, and 3.20 mg × mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) [

 <sup>−1</sup>) were added to 1 mL of the different concentrations of extracts and essential oils. Absorbance was measured after 10 min at 517 nm using a 1700 PharmaSpec UV/Vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Warsaw, Poland). The antioxidant activity of extracts and essential oils was calculated as I = [(AB − AA)/AB] × 100, where I is DPPH inhibition (%); AB is the absorbance of a blank sample (t = 0 min); AA is the absorption of extract solution (t = 10 min). Trolox was used to estimate a standard curve. Results are expressed in μmol Trolox equivalents per g of extract and essential oil.
