<p>ABTS (2,2’-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid radical caption) was measured according to the method described by Re et al. [
 <xref rid="B84-molecules-26-00988" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>] and Arts et al. [
 <xref rid="B85-molecules-26-00988" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. A stock solution was prepared by stirring 7 mM ABTS and 2.45 mM (final concentration) potassium persulfate in water and incubating at room temperature in the dark, for 16 h before use. The concentrated ABTS was diluted with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to a final absorbance of 0.72 (±02) at 734 nm. Then 1 mL ABTS solution was added to 100 μL of extracts (2×, 4×, 8×, 16× diluted solutions) and 100 μL of essential oil (0.20, 0.40, 0.80, 1.60, and 3.20 mg/ml concentrations). Absorbance of ABTS was measured on a 1700 PharmaSpec UV/Vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu) after 6 min incubation in dark, at 734 nm. The ability of the test sample to scavenge ABTS was compared to the Trolox standard. The solutions of Trolox were prepared in PBS, such that the final concentrations of the standards were 0.0, 1.25, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, 10.0 mg × 100 mL
 <sup>−1</sup>. The percentage inhibition of ABTS of the test samples were calculated according to the following formula: 
 <disp-formula>% inhibition = [(AB − AA)/AB] × 100</disp-formula> where AB is the absorbance of a blank sample and AA is the absorbance of the test sample. Results are expressed in mg Trolox equivalents per 100 mL of extract.
