<p>The analysis was performed by usage of an Agilent Technologies 7890A gas chromatograph combined with a flame ionization detector (FID) and MS Agilent Technologies 5975C Inert XL_MSD with Triple Axis Detector (Agilent Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA). A polar capillary Omegawax
 <sup>®</sup> column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 µm film thickness) was applied. Separation conditions were as follows: oven temperature isotherm at 60 °C for 2 min, then it was programmed from 60 °C to 220 °C at a rate of 4°C per min and held isothermal at 220 °C for 5 min. Separation conditions were previously described by Bączek et al. [

Essential oil compounds identification was based on comparison of mass spectra from the Mass Spectral Database, as following: NIST08, NIST27, NIST147, NIST11, Wiley7N2, and on comparison of retention indices (RI) relative to retention times of a series of n-hydrocarbons (C7–C30) with those reported in the literature [
