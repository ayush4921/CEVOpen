<p>Standards were purchased from Sigma Life Science (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and ChromaDex
 <sup>®</sup> (Irvine, CA, USA) and separately dissolved with MeOH in 25 ml volumetric flask according to the ChromaDex’s Tech Tip 0003: Reference Standard Recovery and Dilution and used as standard stock solutions [
 <xref rid="B80-molecules-26-00988" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Working solutions were prepared by diluting 10 µL and 100 µL of standard stock solutions with methanol in 10 mL volumetric flasks, 500 µL and 1000 µL in 5 mL volumetric flasks as well as 1000 µL in 2 mL volumetric flasks. The working solutions and undiluted stock solutions were injected (1 μL) on a column in six replicates (
 <italic>n</italic> = 6) using SIL-20AC HT. Six-point calibration curves were plotted according to the external standard method by correlating concentration with peak area. Curves parameters were calculated with Microsoft Excel 14 (Microsoft, Warsaw, Poland). Signal-to-noise ratio approach were used to determined LOD (S/N of 3:1) and LOQ (S/N of 10:1). The peak table and UV-spectra library (190–450 nm) of individual compounds were also created.
