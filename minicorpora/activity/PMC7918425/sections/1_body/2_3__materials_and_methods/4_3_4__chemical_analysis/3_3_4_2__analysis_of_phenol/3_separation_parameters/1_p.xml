<p>The work was performed using a Shimadzu Prominence chromatograph equipped with a SIL-20AC HT auto sampler, SPD-M20A photodiode array detector and LC solution 1.21 SP1 chromatography software (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Separations were achieved using a 100 mm × 4.60 mm, C18 reversed-phase column, 2.6 μm particles with solid core and porous outer layer (Kinetex™, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA). Binary gradient of mobile phase A (deionised water adjusted to pH 2 with phosphoric acid) and B (ACN) was used as follows: 0 min—12.5% B; 4.0 min—23% B; 6.0 min—50% B; 6.01 min—12.5% B; 8 min—stop. The HPLC conditions were as follows: flow rate 1.5 ml×min
 <sup>−1</sup>, oven temperature 40 °C, injection volume 1 μL.
