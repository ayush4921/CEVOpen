0: Virola is the largest genus of Myristicaceae in America, comprising about 60 species of medium-sized trees geographically spread from Mexico to southern Brazil.
1: The plant species of this genus have been widely used in folk medicine for the treatment of several ailments, such as rheumatic pain, bronchial asthma, tumors in the joints, intestinal worms, halitosis, ulcers, and multiple infections, due to their pharmacological activity.
2: This review presents an updated and comprehensive summary of   Virola species, particularly their ethnomedicinal uses, phytochemistry, and biological activity, to support the safe medicinal use of plant extracts and provide guidance for future research.
3: The   Virola spp.s ethnopharmacology, including in the treatment of stomach pain and gastric ulcers, as well as antimicrobial and tryponosomicidal activities, is attributable to the presence of a myriad of phytoconstituents, such as flavonoids, tannins, phenolic acids, lignans, arylalkanones, and sitosterol.
4: Hence, such species yield potential leads or molecular scaffolds for the development of new pharmaceutical formulations, encouraging the elucidation of not-yet-understood action mechanisms and ascertaining their safety for humans.
