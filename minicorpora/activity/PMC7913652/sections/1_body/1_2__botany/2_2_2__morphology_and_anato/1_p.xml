<p>The plants of the 
 <italic>Virola</italic> genus are characterized by distinctive growth forms and fruit. In particular, they grow as monopodial, orthotropic principal shoots, and plagiotropic lateral branches with distichous phyllotaxy—myristicaceous branching; the fruit’s maturation is accompanied by dehisce into two valves, displaying a single seed covered by a brightly colored laciniate aril rich in proteins, lipids, and sugars. These seeds are mainly dispersed by birds and monkeys [
