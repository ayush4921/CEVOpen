<p>The renoprotective activity of 
 <italic>V. oleifera</italic> resin may be attributable, at least in part, to the presence of antioxidant species, such as ferulic acid, gallic acid, and quercetin, previously identified by our group [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-26-00792" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Moreover, we also described that the gastroprotective effect of this extract could be related to the content of polyphenols (~82%), namely, tannins (67.66 g/100 g of resin), phenolic acids, and flavonoids (48.257 ± 28.27 mg quercetin equivalent/100 g of resin), particularly epicatechin and eriodictyol [

 <italic>V. oleifera</italic> leaf methanolic extracts have shown promising results as an analgesic treatment, which could be related to the oleiferin-C and flavonoid (quercitrin and astilbin) content [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-26-00792" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The administration of 
 <italic>V. oleifera</italic> leaf methanolic extract (10 mg/kg i.p.) inhibited acetic acid-induced abdominal constriction in mice similarly to aspirin or paracetamol [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-26-00792" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Notably, oleiferin-C dose-dependently inhibited abdominal constriction by 76% at 29.2 µmol/kg (ID
 <sub>50</sub>: 17.2 µmol/kg), being 7.5-fold more active than aspirin (ID
 <sub>50</sub>: 125 µmol/kg) or paracetamol (ID
 <sub>50</sub>: 133 µmol/kg). In this study, the compounds quercitrin (quercetin-3-O-rhamnoside) and astilbin (taxifolin-3-O-rhamnoside) were also identified in the ethyl acetate fraction in a 2:1 ratio (quercitrin: astilbin), causing a reduction of 63% in abdominal muscle constriction. Since astilbin is inactive as an analgesic in mice, the effects of the quercitrin:astilbin mixture are likely due to quercitrin itself or to a potentiating synergistic effect between the two compounds [
