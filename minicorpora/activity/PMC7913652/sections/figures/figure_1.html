 <caption> Virola oleifera in Espirito Santo, Brazil. The resin was collected from 0.5 cm-deep incisions in the tree trunk, as demonstrated in ( A), and transferred into an amber glass vial ( B). The fluid exudate was dried at 40 °C ( C) and ground. Afterwards, the resin was sheltered from light at 4 °C until used as shown in ( D). Previous chemical characterization by our research group revealed a high content of polyphenols, the main compounds demonstrated in ( E) [ 16, 33]. </caption>
