    <i>S. Rechingeri</i> essential oils had a hepatoprotective activity against acetaminophen induced hepatotoxicity in rats. In this study, the animals were pre-treated with one dose of the essential oil: 20 mg/kg diluted in 400 mL DMSO. Followed by the administration of 500 mg/kg acetaminophen dissolved in 400 mL DMSO after 14 days of the treatment. The results indicated that acetaminophen decrease the activities of GPx, glutathione reductase (GR), SOD and GSH content and increased AST activity and the level of FRAP and LPO. While, the treatment with the essential oil protected effectively the liver against toxicity induced by the hepatotoxine. It is increased GSH, SOD, GPx and GR levels.
