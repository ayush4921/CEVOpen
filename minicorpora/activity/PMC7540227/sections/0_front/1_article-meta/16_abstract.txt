3: So, we have used the keywords Hepatoprotective effect, liver disease, plants and essential oils.Results and conclusion In this work, we classified the plants; contain the essential oils, in alphabetical order as a table containing the scientific, family names, information plants, the experimental assay and the results obtained from the hepatoprotective studies.
4: We have described 27 species belonging to 12 families Lamiaceae (7 species), Asteraceae (6 species), Umbellifereae (3 species), Apiaceae (3 species) are the main families which enclose the species that was studied.
5: The study also includes the major compounds isolated from some of these essential oils.
6: The most of those compounds belong to terpene class essentially cineol, carvacrol and thymol.
