<p>Results of DPPH radical scavenging activity of the crude extracts were shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-03664-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. All the five extracts exhibited a DPPH radical scavenging ability in a dose-dependent manner. In general, CE exhibited the strongest radical scavenging capacity among the five extracts, and its IC
 <sub>50</sub> value was determined as 20.3 µg/mL. This was followed by the EE and BE, as they all exhibited excellent radical scavenging ability with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 24.1 µg/mL and 36.1 µg/mL, respectively. However, the scavenging ability of the DPPH radical by WE (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 130.5 µg/mL) and PE (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 321.8 µg/mL) appeared to be relatively weaker. Totally, the DPPH radical scavenging activity was in the order of CE &gt; EE &gt; BE &gt; WE&gt; PE &gt; EO.
