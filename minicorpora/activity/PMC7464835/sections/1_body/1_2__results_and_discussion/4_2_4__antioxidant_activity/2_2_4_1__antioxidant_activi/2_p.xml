<p>For many cases, antioxidant substances may have the reducing power ability [

 <sup>3+</sup>/ferricyanide complex to the ferrous form, and form Perl’s Prussian blue with ferric chloride [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-25-03664" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The Prussian blue can be measured at 700 nm, and the absorbance may serve as an indicator of antioxidant capacity. The higher absorbance indicated stronger potential antioxidant activity. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03664-f003">Figure 3</xref> illustrated the reducing power activity of the essential oil and five crude extracts. At different concentrations (78.125–625 µg/mL), these test samples exhibited different reducing abilities. In all, the reduction power was gradually increased with the increasing concentrations. Among the extracts and EO, EE displayed the best reducing activity, followed by the CE, BE and WE. However, the PE and EO displayed weak or no reducing power in this test. Generally, the five extracts and EO showed different activity in the two different antioxidant models, and both CE and EE exhibited strong antioxidant activities in the DPPH radical scavenging and Fe
 <sup>2+</sup> reducing power tests. The reducing power ability was in the order of EE &gt; CE &gt; BE &gt; WE &gt; PE &gt; EO, which was similar to that of DPPH scavenging activity, except for EE and CE.
