<p>The DPPH radical scavenging activity results from four identified compounds, which are presented in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-03664-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>. Of them, ethyl gallate and rosavin displayed excellent radical scavenging activity, with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 5.33 µg/mL and 5.86 µg/mL, respectively, which were stronger than the positive control butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 17.96 µg/mL) in this study. Gallic acid exhibited similar ability with the positive control, and its IC
 <sub>50</sub> value was calculated as 18.03 µg/mL. Comparing with the crude extracts of CE and EE, herbacetin showed similar DPPH radical scavenging activity, but it was weaker than that of the other three identified compounds. On the whole, the DPPH radical scavenging activity was in the order of ethyl gallate ≈ rosavin &gt; gallic acid ≈ BHT &gt; herbacetin.
