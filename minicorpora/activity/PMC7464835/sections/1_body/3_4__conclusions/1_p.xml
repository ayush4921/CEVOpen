<p>The essential oil of fresh rhizomes of 
 <italic>R. crenulata</italic> was rich in alcohols and monoterpenes, and its major components were 1-octanol (42.217%), geraniol (19.914%) and 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-ol (13.151%). The results showed that ethanol extract (crude extract, CE), ethyl acetate extract (EE), and 
 <italic>n</italic>-butanol extract (BE) were abundant in phenolic acids and flavonoids. Both CE and EE exhibited strong activities in the antibacterial and antioxidant assays. Four compounds were successfully identified from the ethyl acetate extract. Of them, rosavin displayed excellent antioxidant activity both in the DPPH radical scavenging assay and the Fe
 <sup>2+</sup> reducing power assay. Ethyl gallate, gallic acid and herbacetin could strongly inhibit the growth of important clinic pathogenic bacteria, and they play an important role in the antibacterial activity of the extract. This research firstly reported the antibacterial and antioxidant activities of the essential oil of 
 <italic>R. crenulata.</italic> Additionally, the antibacterial and antioxidant activities of the five crude extracts from 
 <italic>R. crenulata</italic> and the bioactive constituents in the extract were also investigated. These results may provide more evidence for the traditional use of the rhizomes of 
 <italic>R. crenulata</italic> in treating diarrhea and scald, and would be helpful for improving its application further.
