<p>The biological functions of the rhizomes extracts of 
 <italic>R. crenulata</italic> have been studied for many years, and their outstanding pharmacological effects have also been gradually revealed. However, the chemical basis, as well as the various bioactivities of this well known medicinal plant still need to be further elucidated. In addition, the essential oil (EO) extracted from 
 <italic>R. crenulata</italic> has also aroused the interests of many researchers. It was reported that about 60 volatile components have been identified from the essential oil of
