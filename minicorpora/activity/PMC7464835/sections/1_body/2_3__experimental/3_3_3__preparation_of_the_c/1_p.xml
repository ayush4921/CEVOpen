<p>The air-dried and powdered rhizomes of 
 <italic>R. crenulata</italic> (1400.0 g, dry weight) were extracted with 95% ethanol under reflux for three times, and 3 h for each time. The combined ethanol solution was concentrated dryness to obtain the crude extract (CE) (101.0 g). A part of the crude extract (80.0 g) was further suspended in hot water, and extracted with petroleum ether, ethyl acetate and n-butanol in turn. Subsequently, these solutions were concentrated in vacuum, respectively, to obtain the petroleum ether extract (PE), ethyl acetate extract (EE) and 
 <italic>n</italic>-butanol extract (BE) and water extract (WE).
