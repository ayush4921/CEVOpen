<p>The quantification of the total phenols of the extracts was performed according to the Folin-Ciocalteu method described by Bujor [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-25-03664" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] with some modifications. Approximately 0.1 mL of each extract solution (5000 μg/mL) or gallic acid (62.5–1000 μg/mL) was mixed with 7.9 mL of distilled water and 0.5 mL Folin-Ciocalteu’s reagent. Then, 1.5 mL of 20% sodium carbonate was added to the mixture mentioned above at 30 °C for 1 h. The absorbance was read at 750 nm by a spectrophotometer. The total phenol content was expressed as the milligram of gallic acid equivalent (GAE) per gram of extract.
