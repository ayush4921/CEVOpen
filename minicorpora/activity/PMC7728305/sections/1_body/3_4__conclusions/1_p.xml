<p>The multi-strategy approach used in this study for the tasks of classification and detection of volatile bioactive compounds with antibacterial activity made it possible to highlight the differentiation of the samples of the essential oils studied. Moreover, a GC-MS technique was used to identify and qualitatively assess the content of bioactive compounds in the essential oil samples. As a result, twenty-one compounds for okoume and eighteen for aiele essential oil were identified. The main compounds were o-cymene(1-methyl-2-propan-2-ylbenzene), (+)-4-Carene ((1R,4S,6S)-4,7,7-trimethylbicyclo[4.1.0]hept-2-ene), 2-(4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-ol for both essential oils. Benzenemethanol, α, α, 4-trimethyl-(28.85%), (+)-3-Carene (3,7,7-trimethyl bicyclo[4.1.0]hept-3-ene) (17.93%), D-Limonene ((4R)-1-methyl-4-prop-1-en-2-ylcyclohexene) (19.36%) for the okoume essential oil. 1-methyl-4-propan-2-yl-cyclohexa-1,4-diene (22.31%), 2-methyl-5-propan-2-yl bicyclo[3.1.0]hexan-2-ol (24.7%), (4-methyl-1-propan-2-yl cyclohex-3-en-1-yl) acetate (26.64%) for the aiele essential oil. On the one hand, the electronic nose, combined with several chemometric techniques, has demonstrated a great ability at discriminating between the two types of essential oils from the same plant family. Likewise, the results of the DFA lead to a satisfactory classification for all analyzed samples. In general, the essential oils have some common compounds according to the results obtained by GC-MS, which may explain the three misclassified samples when HCA was used. This proves that the grouping classifications of the e-nose were highly correlated with the GC-MS results. On the other hand, the combination of the e-nose system and GC-MS allowed the identification of bioactive compounds in the essential oil samples that have strong antimicrobial activity against the two bacteria tested, i.e., 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. This is because both essential oils contain monoterpenes, which have a strong antibacterial activity. Therefore, the use of such tools can ensure the determination of bioactive compounds in essential oils, which can be used against antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
