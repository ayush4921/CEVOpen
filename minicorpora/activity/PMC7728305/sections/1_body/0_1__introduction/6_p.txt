0: To the best of our knowledge, no attempt has yet been made to investigate the compounds of okoume and aiele essential oils using (e-nose) combined with GC-MS. For these reasons, on the one hand, we investigated the capability of an e-nose coupled to various chemometric methods, namely principal component analysis (PCA), discriminant function analysis (DFA), and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), to first classify and discriminate between the two Gabonese essential oils of  Canarium schweinfurthii (aiele), and  Aucoumea klaineana (okoume).
1: In addition, we determined the chemical composition and evaluated the efficacy and pure major compounds by GC-MS analysis.
2: On the other hand, we used the aromatogram method to reveal their antibacterial activity in vitro against two bacteria strains  Escherichia coli (Gram) and  Staphylococcus aureus (Gram+).
