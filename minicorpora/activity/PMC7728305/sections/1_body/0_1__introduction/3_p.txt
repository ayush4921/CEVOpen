0: Several methods have been proposed to identify volatile compounds contained in essential oils such as high-precision liquid chromatography (HPLC) [ 13], gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) [ 14], GCMS combined with chemometric resolution methods [ 15], Two-Dimensional Gas chromatography (GC  GC) [ 16], and ATR-Fourier transform mid-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) [ 17].
1: However, most of these techniques are usually time-consuming and costly.
2: Electronic noses have been explored as a more affordable approach to discriminate different essential oils [ 18].
