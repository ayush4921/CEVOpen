0: The electronic nose (e-nose) is a device that integrates a group of gas sensors with partial specificity and an adequate pattern recognition system, able to recognize both simple and complex odors [ 19].
1: In e-nose devices, samples are analyzed and classified (in terms of quality) on the basis of their fingerprints or patterns obtained from their volatile compounds [ 20].
2: Electronic noses are fast, economical, convenient, and reliable devices for non-destructive testing [ 21].
3: Electronic noses are used for many applications such as product classification within the food industry sector [ 22, 23, 24], determination of the quality and storage life [ 25, 26], recognizing the maturity of fruit [ 27, 28, 29], and assessment of adulterated products [ 30, 31, 32, 33].
4: Many studies on the use of e-nose systems for assessing the quality and distinction of natural MAPs (medicinal and aromatic plants) have been described in the literature [ 34].
5: For instance, the quality control of  Alpinia officinarum using an e-nose and GC-MS coupled with chemometrics [ 35], the discrimination and characterization of licorice ( Glycyrrhiza glabra L.) roots utilizing electronic nose and HS-SPME/GC/MS analysis [ 36], as well as the quality control method for musk by an e-nose coupled with chemometrics [ 37].
6: Such an approach has also been envisaged for some other plants, including  Mentha spicata L. [ 38],  Cymbidium ensifolium [ 39], ginseng [ 40, 41, 42],  Eurycoma longifolia [ 43],  apiaceae [ 44],  Cannabis sativa L. [ 45],  Glycyrrhiza glabra L. [ 46],  Citrus reticulata [ 47], as well as the classification of rosemary essential oil ( Rosmarinus officinalis L.) [ 48].
