<p>Feature extraction is an essential pre-processing step for pattern recognition [

The functions used for data analysis are automatically extracted from the gas sensor responses in order to extract the maximum amount of information available in the database. Consequently, for each measurement performed, four representative characteristics were extracted from the response of each sensor, which are as follows: 
 <list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
   <p>G0, the initial sensor conductance determined as the average value of its conductance during the first minute of a measurement.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Gs, which represents the steady state conductance determined as the average value of its conductance during the last minute of a measurement.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>dG/dt, which corresponds to the dynamic slope of the conductance determined between 2 and 9 min of measurement.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>A, the area under the conductance curve during a defined time interval between 2 and 9 min of measurement. This area has been estimated by the trapezium method.</p>
