<p>The DFA method is the most frequently used and best-studied supervised pattern recognition method [
 <xref rid="B54-sensors-20-06750" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. It is based on the determination of discriminant functions, which maximize the variance ratio between classes by minimizing the intra-class variance ratio. This technique constitutes the factorial method. Its objective is to examine whether or not the variables are sufficient to be able to classify correctly the data a posteriori into their a priori groups.
