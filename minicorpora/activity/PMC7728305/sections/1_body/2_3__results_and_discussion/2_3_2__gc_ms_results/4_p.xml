 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-20-06750-f003">Figure 3</xref> shows that the chromatogram of okoume essential oil showed a significantly higher number of peaks than that of aiele essential oils. The first compound appeared at 1.63 min. Then a succession of peaks of notable height appeared placed between different very small peaks. In all, there were four important peaks, between t = 10 min and 20 min. In addition to this, there are five dominant peaks that appeared at about 15 min and 28.5 min. Finally, other peaks with very small amplitudes were obtained. According to these results, the main components were α-Terpineol (2-(4-methylcyclohex-3-en-1-yl)propan-2-ol) (29.04% and 28.49% for okoume and aiele essential oils, respectively), which was recorded in other studies on the composition of the Burseraceae family [

Benzenemethanol, α, α, 4-trimethyl (28.85%), (+)-3-Carene (3,7,7-trimethyl bicyclo[4.1.0]hept-3-ene) (17.93%), D-Limonene ((4R)-1-methyl-4-prop-1-en-2-ylcyclohexene) (19.36%) for okoume essential oil. This result has been confirmed by previously published research conducted on the volatile oil of 
 <italic>Aucoumea klaineana</italic> oleoresin harvested in Gabon [
 <xref rid="B56-sensors-20-06750" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. (1S,4R)-4-Isopropyl-1-methyl-2-cyclohexen-1-ol) (25.90%) and 2-cyclohexen-1-ol, 1-methyl-4-(1-methylethyl)-, cis(1-methyl-4-propan-2-ylcyclohex-2-en-1-ol) (26.83%) were identified for aiele essential oil. These results are also in good agreement with previous works on the composition of essential oils in 
 <italic>Canarium schweinfurthii</italic> (aiele) resin from Gabon [
 <xref rid="B57-sensors-20-06750" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Other predominant constituents were benzenemethanol, α, α, 4-trimethyl-(28.85%), 1, 3, 8-p-Menthatriene(1-methyl-4-prop-1-en-2-yl-cyclohexa-1,3-diene) (24.91%), bicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-one, 1,7,7-trimethyl-, (1S)-Camphor (26.92%) for okoume and 1-methyl-4-propan-2-yl-cyclohexa-1,4-diene (22.31%), 2-methyl-5-propan-2-yl bicyclo[3.1.0]hexan-2-ol (24.7%), (4-methyl-1-propan-2-yl cyclohex-3-en-1-yl) acetate (26.64%) for aiele. As can be derived from 
 <xref rid="sensors-20-06750-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, the predominant shared compounds in aiele and okoume essential oils are o-cymene(1-methyl-2-propan-2-ylbenzene), (+)-4-Carene ((1R,4S,6S)-4,7,7-trimethylbicyclo[4.1.0]hept-2-ene).
