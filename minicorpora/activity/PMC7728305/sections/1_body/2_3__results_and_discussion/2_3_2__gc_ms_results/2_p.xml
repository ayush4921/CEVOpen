The amount of VOCs released by okoume essential oil samples was much higher than that of the aiele essential oil samples. Mass spectra were compared to the NIST11 mass spectra database and a compound was considered as identified provided that the match between our experiment and the database was 75% or higher. Using this technique, twenty-one compounds were identified from okoume essential oil, compared to eighteen compounds from aiele (
