<p>Okoume essential oil has a significant inhibitory effect against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (20 mm) and a moderate inhibitory effect for 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (6 mm). In the literature, essential oils with higher concentrations of components including: δ-3-carene, linalool, α-pinene, β-pinene, limonene, 1, 8-cineole [

 <xref rid="B59-sensors-20-06750" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] have been reported to show enhanced antibacterial activity. These findings are consistent with the results reported here for the essential oil extracted from
