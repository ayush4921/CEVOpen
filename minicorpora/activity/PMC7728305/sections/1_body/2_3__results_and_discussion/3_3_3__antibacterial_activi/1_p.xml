<p>The results of the antibacterial test are summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-20-06750-f004">Figure 4</xref>. They show that both the essential oil of okoume and aiele have a broad antibacterial activity because they inhibit the growth of Gram+ and Gramâˆ’ bacteria, producing a zone of inhibition diameter (zdi) of 6 to 12 mm for 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 16 to 20 mm for 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, respectively. According to the results in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-20-06750-f004">Figure 4</xref>, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> is sensitive to both essential oils. However, the inhibition zone is larger for the oil extracted from 
 <italic>Aucoumea klaineana</italic> (okoume) than for the oil extracted from 
 <italic>Canarium schweinfurthii</italic> (aiele). Based on these results, it can be stated that the essential oils showed a clear antimicrobial activity on all strains tested.
