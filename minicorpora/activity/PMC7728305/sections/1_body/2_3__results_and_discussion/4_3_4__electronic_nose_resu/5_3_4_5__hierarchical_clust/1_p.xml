<p>The HCA provides an alternative for the visual representation of high-dimensional data. The results are illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-20-06750-f010">Figure 10</xref> in the form of a dendrogram obtained from the essential oil samples by applying the Euclidean distance and Wardâ€™s link to define the groups. At link. dist = 9, it can be seen that all the samples are grouped into two separate groups, corresponding to the essential oils analyzed. However, samples 2, 3, and 4 belonging to okoume oil are misclassified as aiele oil. The overlaps obtained may be due to the fact that the essential oils possess certain compounds in common according to the results obtained by GC-MS. This proves that the grouping classifications were highly correlated to the GC-MS results. In addition, this result does not contradict the PCA results in which okoume samples show a rather high dispersion in the score plot. Some okoume samples have scores that appear closer to the centroid for aiele, which possibly explains their misclassification by HCA.
