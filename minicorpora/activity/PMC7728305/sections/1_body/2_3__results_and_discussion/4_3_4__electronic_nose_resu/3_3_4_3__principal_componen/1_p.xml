<p>The PCA method was applied as an exploratory technique to study the clustering of data points in the multidimensional dataset. Before approaching the different classification tasks by PCA, it is necessary to reduce the size of the data matrix by selecting variables containing differential information, as the number of variables selected depends on the classification task [
 <xref rid="B60-sensors-20-06750" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. In a first step, the data matrix was analyzed using the PCA technique to characterize and discriminate okoume and aiele essential oils. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-20-06750-f007">Figure 7</xref> shows the projections of the experimental results on a three-dimensional (3D) graph using the first three new main components. Showing a cumulated variance of the first three principal components explain 49.56%, 28.66%, and 11.88%, respectively (i.e., 90.22%) of the total data variance. From this figure, it can be noticed that the two types of essential oils can be perfectly discriminated by the e-nose in spite of the method uncertainty (i.e., variability within each class) caused mainly by variability in sensor response. On the one hand, the loadings matrix of (PC) was carried out using three features (normalized delta G, slope, and area) multiplied by the six sensors. The score plot is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-20-06750-f007">Figure 7</xref>. Moreover, the discrimination obtained by the PCA is in good concordance with the specific VOCs that are identified by GC-MS in each essential oil. In particular, okoume essential oils contained some distinctive volatiles (i.e., acetone, toluene, pinenes, and terpenes) that do not appear in the essential oil of aiele. Sensor TGS 822 is quite sensitive to organic solvents such as toluene and acetone and, indeed the response of this sensor to volatiles from okume is significantly higher than for volatiles from aiele (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-20-06750-f006">Figure 6</xref>). These differences may explain the discrimination between the two essential oils reached by the e-nose instrument using PCA.
