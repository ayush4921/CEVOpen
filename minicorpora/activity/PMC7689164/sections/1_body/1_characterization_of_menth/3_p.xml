<p id="p0045">The obtained differences in essential oil yield and chemical composition among the different samples of a Mentha species are due to the effect of parameters such as the geographical area, the season in which plant samples were collected, the distilled part of the plant, the applied distillation technique, and the occurrence of different chemotypes within the same species [

 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. 
 <italic>M. pulegium</italic> chemotypes contain either high amounts of piperitone and piperitenone or are pulegone-type [
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Due to the high content in piperitenone and piperitone oxides, the studied Moroccan 
 <italic>M. longifolia</italic> is considered as a new chemotype [
