<p id="p0065">The antifungal activity of the essential oil of Mentha species is less studied compared to the antibacterial activity. This statement could be explained by the fact that antifungal activity is more delicate to investigate. The investigation of the antifungal effect of 
 <italic>M. pulegium</italic> on strains causing eczematic sur-infections demonstrated that the plant essential oil has significant inhibitory activity on the three fungi 
 <italic>Trichophyton mentagrophytes</italic>, 
 <italic>Trichophyton rubrum</italic>, and 
 <italic>Epidermophyton floccosum</italic> [
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The essential oil of 
 <italic>M. pulegium</italic> is highly effective towards 
 <italic>Rhisosporus</italic> sp with a total inhibition of mycelial growth and sporulation at only 0.03% and 0.10% of the essential oil concentration, respectively [
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The antifungal activity of Mentha essential oil is mainly due to the presence of terpenes and terpenoids [

 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In 
 <italic>M. pulegium</italic> Essential oil, highly active oxygenated monoterpenes are found at high concentrations [
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Pulegone is the most effective component of 
 <italic>M. suaveolens</italic> essential oil, against 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>Candida glabrata</italic> [
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. 
 <italic>Mentha viridis</italic> essential oil inhibited up to 90% of mycelial growth of pathogenic 
 <italic>Trichophyton mentagrophytes</italic>, 
 <italic>Trichophyton tonsurans</italic>, and 
 <italic>Trichophyton violaceum</italic> [
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], meanwhile essential oil of 
 <italic>M. suaveolens</italic> caused a total inhibition of growth of 
 <italic>Trichophyton rubrum</italic> at only 0,10% of essential oil in experimental medium [
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Nevertheless, further in vivo tests are required to confirm antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal activities of Mentha essential oils reported in in vitro tests [
