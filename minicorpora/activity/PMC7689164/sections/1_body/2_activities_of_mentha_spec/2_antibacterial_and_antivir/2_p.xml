 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> represents the activities of the different Mentha species. The study of the activity of Mentha species extracts showed that a main interest has been dedicated to investigate antibacterial activity of mint extracts towards gram+ and gram- bacteria that are a source of multiple diseases in Morocco and worldwide. 
 <italic>M. pulegium</italic> is the most studied species for its antibacterial activity. Essential oils of 
 <italic>M. pulegium</italic>, 
 <italic>M. viridis</italic>, 
 <italic>M. longifolia</italic>, and 
 <italic>M. suaveolens</italic> are performing antibacterial effects towards gram+ and gram- bacteria [
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Gram + bacteria are more susceptible than gram- bacteria to the antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic>M. pulegium</italic> essential oil, considering the MBC/MIC ratios (MBC = Minimal Bactericidal Concentration, MIC = Minimal Inhibitory Concentration) [
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This result could be explained by the characteristics and structure of the cell envelope of the gram- bacteria [
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. 
 <italic>M. pulegium</italic> essential oil is more effective than amoxicillin toward 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, and 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae,</italic> but less effective towards those same strains in comparison with the antibiotic imipenem in agar medium [
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The essential oil of 
 <italic>M. pulegium</italic> combined with heat was highly effective, as up to 5 log10 cell cycle reductions were obtained, due to heat making cells more sensitive to the bactericidal activity of the essential oil constituents, mainly sesquiterpenes [
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Gamma irradiation of 
 <italic>M. pulegium</italic> plant significantly affects the antibacterial activity of its essential oil especially towards gram- bacteria [
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. 
 <italic>M. viridis</italic> essential oil was more performing than erythromycin and chloramphenicol against a range of gram+ and gram- bacteria, with gram + bacteria more inhibited than gram- bacteria [
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Ethyl acetate extract from 
 <italic>M. longifolia</italic> inhibited to 50% the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase [
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].
