0: Morocco is located in North Africa between 21o-36 N and 1o-17 W, bordered by both the Mediterranean and the Atlantic, with a surface of 710.850 km 2 and about 3400 km of coastlines.
1: The geography of Morocco is characterized by the presence of the sea, the desert, and the mountains.
2: The variation in altitude creates isolated zones with special ecology and climate that varies from humid to Saharan [ 1,  2].
3: We register the occurrence of about 42.000 species of plants, classified into 150 families and 940 genera [ 2].
4: The number of endemic plants in the Moroccan flora is estimated to 900 species [ 3].
5: The mountainous regions of Atlas and Rif are the most important areas for endemism [ 4,  5,  6].
6: By its biogeographical location, Morocco hosts a very rich floristic diversity as it is considered an actual plant genetic reserve [ 3].
7: Moroccan plant resources have potential use in medical, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and agro-alimentary fields.
8: Two-thirds of Moroccan lands can be classified as arid and semiarid with low amounts of rainfall and frequent droughts [ 7].
9: Climate change is likely to have a strong effect resulting in more aridity in Morocco.
10: Moreover, arid conditions are accentuated by a continuously increasing crop to respond to the demographic pressure and economic development [ 7,  8].
