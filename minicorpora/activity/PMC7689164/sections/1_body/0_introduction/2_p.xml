<p id="p0010">Morocco is located in North Africa between 21º-36° N and 1º-17° W, bordered by both the Mediterranean and the Atlantic, with a surface of 710.850 km
 <sup>2</sup> and about 3400 km of coastlines. The geography of Morocco is characterized by the presence of the sea, the desert, and the mountains. The variation in altitude creates isolated zones with special ecology and climate that varies from humid to Saharan [

 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. We register the occurrence of about 42.000 species of plants, classified into 150 families and 940 genera [
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The number of endemic plants in the Moroccan flora is estimated to 900 species [

 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Moroccan plant resources have potential use in medical, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and agro-alimentary fields. Two-thirds of Moroccan lands can be classified as arid and semiarid with low amounts of rainfall and frequent droughts [
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Climate change is likely to have a strong effect resulting in more aridity in Morocco. Moreover, arid conditions are accentuated by a continuously increasing crop to respond to the demographic pressure and economic development [
