0: This work is a summary of the characterization, activities, and ethnobotanical surveys about aromatic and medicinal plants belonging to the genus Mentha in Morocco.
1: The Mentha species investigated are   Mentha pulegium, Mentha spicata,   Mentha viridis,   Mentha suaveolens,   Mentha longifolia,   Mentha gattefossei,   Mentha rotundifolia, and   Mentha vulgare, with   M. pulegium being the most studied species.
2: M. spicata and   M. viridis are poorly explored even though they are daily consumed by Moroccans in tea infusions.
3: The elucidated factors affecting the composition of Mentha essential oils are fertilization, drying conditions, mechanical impedance, NaCl stress, and Gamma irradiation.
4: Investigation of the activities of the Mentha species showed that the main interest was dedicated to addressing the antibacterial effect towards gram+ and gram- bacteria.
5: Essential oils of Mentha species exhibited antifungal, antiviral, antioxidant, insecticidal, licidal, niticidal, allelopathic, antidiabetic, derma-protective, and anticorrosive activities.
6: The ethnobotanical surveys revealed that Mentha species are used in seven regions: Tafilalet, High Atlas, Fez-Boulemane, Taounat, Oujda, Ouazzane, and Rabat.
7: By calculating the Jaccard index, the highest degree of similarity was found between Tafilalet, Rabat, and Oujda regions.
8: The wide use of the Mentha species in Morocco highlights the high ethnobotanical value of the genus.
