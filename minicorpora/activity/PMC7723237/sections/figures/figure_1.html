 <caption> Phylogenetic dendrogram based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showing the site of strain AKM5 &amp; AKM6 between members of diverse genus species. The evolutionary history was inferred using the UPGMA method. 59 The optimal tree with the sum of branch length = 0.13321378 is shown. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Kimura 2-parameter method 60 and are in the units of the number of base substitutions per site. The analysis involved 21 nucleotide sequences. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. There were a total of 258 positions in the final dataset. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA6. 61 </caption>
