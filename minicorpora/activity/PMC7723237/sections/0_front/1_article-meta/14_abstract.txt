0: Background and AimBacillus species are widely distributed microorganisms in nature that are responsible for outbreaks of food poisoning and a common cause of food spoilage.
1: This study aimed to isolate and identify foodborne    Bacillus species from meat and to determine the antimicrobial activities of commercial essential oils and spices powder extracted from certain medicinal plants.
2: MethodsSixty meat samples were collected in Assiut city and subdivided into raw meat and processed meat.
3: Bacillus spp were isolated and identified according to their cultural characters, biochemical reactions, serological typing, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing.
4: The antibacterial activity of essential oils and spices powder was measured by using well-diffusion and microbial count techniques.
5: ResultsThe prevalence of    Bacillus spp.
6: in the examined raw meat samples and processed meat samples was 13.34%, and 26.67%, respectively.
7: There was a marked decrease in the total    Bacillus species count after treatment of minced beef with essential oils and spices powder compared to the untreated one.
8: Black seed oil was the most potent antibacterial essential oil among the tested oils present in this study.
9: ConclusionEssential oils and spices powder of certain medicinal plants (cumin:    Cuminum cyminum, black seeds:    Nigella sativa, cloves:    Syzygium aromaicum, cinnamon:    Cinnamomum zeylanicum, and Marjoram:    Origanum majorana) have a potential in vitro antimicrobial activity against    Bacillus spp.
10: Furthermore,    Nigella sativa oil exhibited the most potent antibacterial activity against    Bacillus spp.
