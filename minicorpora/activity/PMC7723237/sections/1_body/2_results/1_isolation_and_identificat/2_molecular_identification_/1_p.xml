<p>Two isolates (AKM5 &amp; AKM6) from those, which identified to be 
 <italic>Bacillus species</italic>, were chosen to be additionally confirmed via 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis using the BLASTn tool of the National Center of Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The isolate AKM5 was related to 
 <italic>Bacillus oceanisedimins</italic> and the isolate AKM6 was related to 
 <italic>Brevibacillus invocatus</italic>. Our sequences were submitted to the GenBank database with the accession numbers KX863513 for AKM5 isolate and accession number KX863514 for AKM6 isolate (
