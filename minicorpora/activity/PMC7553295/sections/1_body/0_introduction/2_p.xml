<p>Cystic echinococcosis is a zoonotic disease caused by the larval stages of the taeniid helminth 
 <italic>Echinococcus granulosus</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0240456.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and is still a major economic and public health concern in several countries around the world [
 <xref rid="pone.0240456.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. CE is characterized by the long-lasting growth of hydatid cysts in the viscera of intermediate hosts such as sheep, cattle, goats, and humans [
 <xref rid="pone.0240456.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and can pose a serious health threat to humans depending upon the stage and location of the cyst. Usually, 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>granulosus</italic> causes infection by forming cysts in the lungs, liver, brain or other vital organs [
 <xref rid="pone.0240456.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. CE is especially predominant in sheep and cattle raising regions of the world, including South and Central America, the Middle East, and the Mediterranean [
 <xref rid="pone.0240456.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. CE causes financial losses to the livestock industry in the form of condemnation of the infested meat [
 <xref rid="pone.0240456.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], increased mortality, and weight loss as well as decreased milk production, decreased hide value and fecundity [
 <xref rid="pone.0240456.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In addition, CE also results in morbidity and mortality in humans [
 <xref rid="pone.0240456.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].
