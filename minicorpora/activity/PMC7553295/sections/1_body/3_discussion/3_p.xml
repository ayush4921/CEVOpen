<p>Among all the plants parts, leaves were most frequently reported to be used during pharmacological validation of medicinal plants against larvae of the helminth parasite 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>granulosus</italic>. According to Moshi et al. (2012) leaves are preferred by herbalists because they prefer a sustainable supply of raw materials [
 <xref rid="pone.0240456.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Moreover, leaves can be easily harvested without extensively harming plants and this could be the possible reason that leaves are the most utilized plant part [
 <xref rid="pone.0240456.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. Tariq et al. (2017) reported that leaves contain different bioactive compounds which cause a variety of medicinal effects [
 <xref rid="pone.0240456.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. In contrast, Albuquerque (2006) found that such an exceptional use of leaves in herbal medicines could possibly slow down the process of plant growth, which would lead to infrequent plant recipes [
 <xref rid="pone.0240456.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Seeds of plants contain flavonoids, saponins, and tannins etc. and it seems that these phytochemical compounds play key roles in the bioactivity of medicinal plants [
 <xref rid="pone.0240456.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Roots act as storing organs of various nutrients for plants, which could explain why they are extensively used in herbal medicines [
 <xref rid="pone.0240456.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. However, root collection usually results in the death of the plant and can pose serious threats to conservation [
 <xref rid="pone.0240456.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Similarly, harvesting of whole plants for evaluation of their anti-parasitic activities is also problematic from a conservation point of view [
 <xref rid="pone.0240456.ref092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. Extensive use of essential oil and methanolic extract emphasize the role of solvents in extraction of potential bioactive compounds from different plants and their parts as well. Methanol, due to its polar nature, is extremely effective in extracting bioactive compounds from plants [
 <xref rid="pone.0240456.ref093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>], and this could be the possible reason of such an extensive of this solvent is herbal formulations. On the other hand, essential oils have proven anthelmintic activity [
 <xref rid="pone.0240456.ref094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>], moreover they are comprised of terpenes (secondary metabolites) that interfere with biochemical and physiological functions of parasites. No polyherbal formulation was reported from the pharmacological validations of medicinal plants against protoscoleces of 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>granulosus</italic>, even though combination of different plants and extracts are commonly more effective than sole plant/extract [
 <xref rid="pone.0240456.ref095" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. This is a clear gap and in future research polyherbal formulations should be evaluated to obtain promising results.
