 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>granulosus</italic>. Leaves among plant parts, herbs among plant life forms, and essential oil among extracts were dominant in 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies (
 <xref rid="pone.0240456.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Among the reported antihydatid medicinal plants, 
 <italic>Zataria multiflora</italic> Boiss, 
 <italic>Ferula asafetida</italic> L., and 
 <italic>Foeniculum vulgare</italic> Mill. were found to be highly effective 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Essential oil of 
 <italic>Z</italic>. 
 <italic>multiflora</italic> at a concentration of 0.02 mg/ml after exposure for 10 min caused 100% mortality of the protoscoleces. Similarly, 
 <italic>F</italic>. 
 <italic>assafoetida</italic> and 
 <italic>F</italic>. 
 <italic>vulgare</italic> essential oil at 0.06 and 1 mg/ml concentration were 100% effective after 10 and 5 min, respectively.
