<p>A total of 8 active compounds, which were isolated from different medicinal plants, are documented in this review article. Of the reported active compounds, thymol, carvacrol, menthol, berberine, genistein, thymoquinone, ampelopsin, and gallic acid are included. All of these 7 compounds were investigated for 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> efficacy against the protoscoleces, while only 2 compounds (thymol and carvacrol) were used in 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> assays. Thymol, berberine, and thymoquinone revealed significant 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> scolicidal activity at concentration of 0.1, 0.5, and 1 mg/ml after 5, 10, and 1 minute of exposure (
 <xref rid="pone.0240456.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Thymol and carvacrol also showed promising scolicidal activity in 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> assays (
