<p>For determination of the main components of 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> and 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> EOs, GC/MS analysis was performed using the dual-column/dual-detector gas chromatograph Agilent GC-7890B system equipped with autosampler Agilent 7693, two columns (fused-silica HP-5MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 μm) and a DB-HeawyWAX column (30 m × 0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 μm)) and a flame ionization detector (FID) coupled with a single quadrupole mass selective Agilent MSD-5977B detector (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Operational parameters were helium as carrier gas at 1 mL/min, injector temperature 250 °C for both columns. The oven temperature was raised for both columns from 50 °C to 280 °C. Initially, after an isothermic period of 3 min, the heating rate was 3 °C/min until the temperature reached 120 °C. Subsequently, the heating velocity increased to 5 °C/min until it reached 250 °C; and after 5 min of holding time on 250 °C, the heating rate increased to 15 °C/min until it reached 280 °C. Heating was followed by an isothermic period of 20 min. Both EOs were diluted in 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane for GC/MS at a concentration of 20 µg/mL, and for quantitative analysis, 1 μL of methyl octanoate was added as an internal standard. One μL of each EO solution was injected in split mode (split ratio 1:50). The mass detector was set to the following conditions: ionization energy 70 eV, ion source temperature 230 °C, scan time 1 s, mass range 40–600 m/z.
