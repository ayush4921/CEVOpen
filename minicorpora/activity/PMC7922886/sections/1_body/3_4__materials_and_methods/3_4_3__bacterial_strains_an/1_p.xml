<p>In this study, 12 strains of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> were used, including antibiotic-resistant and sensitive forms. Standard strains of the ATCC 25923, 29213, 33591, 33592, 43300, and BAA 976 were purchased from Oxoid (Basingstoke, UK) on ready-to-use bacteriological Culti-Loops. Clinical isolates (SA 1-6) obtained from Motol University Hospital (Prague, Czech Republic) were selected based on the previous antimicrobial susceptibility testing (data not shown) as representatives of methicillin-sensitive 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (SA 1, SA 5, and SA 6) and methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (SA 2, SA 3, and SA 4) strains and were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry as described in Rondevaldova et al. [
