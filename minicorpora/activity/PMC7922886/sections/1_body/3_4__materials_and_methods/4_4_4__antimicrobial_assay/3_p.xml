<p>MIC values and combinatory effects in both liquid and the vapor phases (i.e., in plates and on lids) were evaluated by visual assessment of bacterial growth after coloring of metabolically active staphylococcal colonies with 25 µL of MTT dye in a concentration of 600 µg/mL when the interface of color in broth and on agar changed from yellow and purple (relative to that of colors in control wells). The MIC values were defined as the lowest concentration that visually inhibited staphylococcal growth compared to the compound-free growth control and were expressed in µg/mL. The final MIC values presented in this work are the average of MICs obtained from three independent experiments that were performed in triplicate.</p>
