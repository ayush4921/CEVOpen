<p>The preparation of plate assay and serial dilutions were performed by an automated pipetting platform, Freedom EVO 100, equipped with a four-channel liquid handling arm (Tecan, Mannedorf, Switzerland). In combinations, six two-fold serial dilutions of oregano EO from horizontal rows were subsequently cross-diluted vertically by six two-fold serial dilutions of thyme EO. The final volume in each well was 100 μL, except for the outermost wells, which were left empty to prevent edge leakage effect. The plates were subsequently inoculated by bacterial suspensions using a 96-pin multi-blot replicator (National Institute of Public Health, Prague, Czech Republic). Each plate also contained inoculated and non-inoculated broth, which served as growth and sterility controls, respectively. Oxacillin was used as a positive antibiotic control for verification of susceptibility of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains in broth medium. The DMSO assayed as the negative control at a concentration of 1% did not inhibit any of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains tested either in broth or agar media. After the inoculation, clamps (Lux Tool, Prague, Czech Republic) were used to fasten the plate and lid together, with handmade wooden pads (size 8.5 × 13 × 2 mm) for better fixing, and microtiter plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C.
