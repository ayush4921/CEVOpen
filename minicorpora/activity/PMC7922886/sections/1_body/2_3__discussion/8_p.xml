<p>The above-mentioned data suggest a low toxicological risk of carvacrol and thymol administration through an inhalation route. Moreover, the rich historical evidence of culinary, medicinal, and pharmaceutical uses of 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> and 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> could support their use as safe herbal medicinal products. Therefore, due to the considerable antimicrobial activity as well as the presumable safety of 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> and 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> EOs, it can be assumed that the results of oregano and thyme EO combinations could be potentially applied in the development of various pharmaceutical applications that are based on volatile antimicrobials. These combinations could decrease the minimum effective doses of the agents, thus reducing their possible adverse effects and treatment costs. However, further research to achieve a better understanding of the action mechanisms, further in vivo experiments, and clinical trials on 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> in combination with 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> are still necessary to determine their pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics.
