<p>In our study, the in vitro growth inhibitory effect of both 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> and 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> EOs was slightly stronger in the vapor phase than in a liquid medium since the MIC values were for the vast majority of the staphylococcal strains slightly lower on the agar media than in the broth. The only exceptions were standard strain ATCC 33592 and clinical isolate SA 1, where the antimicrobial effect of 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> was stronger in the liquid phase, and staphylococcal strains ATCC 29213, ATCC 43000, SA 1, and SA 6, where the MICs of 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> EO were the same in both phases. Similar pattern showing that the vapor generated by EOs has a greater antimicrobial effect compared to EOs in liquid form applied by direct contact (in aqueous solutions or on solid agars) can be observed in several previous studies [
