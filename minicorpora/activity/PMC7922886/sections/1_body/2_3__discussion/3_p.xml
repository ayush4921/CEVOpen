<p>If mixtures of EOs are used as antimicrobials, they may, according to the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) [
 <xref rid="B53-plants-10-00393" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], show either an antagonistic, additive, indifferent, or synergistic effect, measured by assessment of the FIC values. Several authors have demonstrated additive effects as well as synergistic actions of 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> EO in combination with 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> EO in the liquid phase. Our results correspond well with Gavaric et al. [
 <xref rid="B35-plants-10-00393" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], who reported additive antibacterial action of thyme and oregano against several bacteria, including 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCC 25923 (FIC value = 1). Similarly, Gutierrez et al. [
 <xref rid="B54-plants-10-00393" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] confirmed the additive effect of these EO combinations against several spoilage organisms, such as 
 <italic>Enterobacter cloacae</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens,</italic> and 
 <italic>Listeria innocua,</italic> using a checkerboard method with FIC values ranging from 0.75 to 1. On the other hand, synergistic activity of oregano and thyme EO combinations have previously been reported as well; for example, in the study of Stojkovic et al. [
 <xref rid="B34-plants-10-00393" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], oregano combined with thyme EO produced synergy against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (FIC value 0.45). However, as the assayed EOs possess similar chemical composition, their combination may exhibit addition rather than a synergistic effect [
