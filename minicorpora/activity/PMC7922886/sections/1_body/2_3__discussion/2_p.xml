<p>Values of MICs observed in our study for 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> and 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> EOs in the liquid phase were similar to numerous previously published data. For example, the investigation carried out by Boskovic et al. [
 <xref rid="B30-plants-10-00393" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] determined antibacterial effects of EOs isolated from 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCC 25923 (MIC values = 640 μg/mL) and methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MRSA) ATCC 43300 (MIC values = 320 μg/mL) using broth microdilution method. In the study performed by Ozkalp et al. [
 <xref rid="B28-plants-10-00393" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> EO inhibited growth of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> Refik Saydam National Type Culture Collection 96090 and MRSA with MIC values 64 and 250 μg/mL, respectively. Similarly, the results of antistaphylococcal activity of 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> EO obtained in this study correspond well with previous findings of Kot et al. [
 <xref rid="B52-plants-10-00393" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], who reported MIC values ranging from 90 to 780 μg/mL against 18 MRSA strains in the liquid phase, or with the results of Boskovic et al. [
 <xref rid="B30-plants-10-00393" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], who determined the antimicrobial effect of thyme EO against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCC 25923 (MIC values = 640 μg/mL) and MRSA ATCC 43300 (MIC values = 320 μg/mL). Moreover, our results are supported by research conducted by Stojkovic [
 <xref rid="B34-plants-10-00393" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], where MICs of oregano and thyme EOs against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> were equal to 0.5 μL/mL and 1 μL/mL, respectively.
