0: Staphylococcus aureus is a gram-positive bacterium that has been responsible for a broad spectrum of diseases, ranging from food poisoning and superficial skin and soft tissue infections to life-threatening infections such as bacteremia, endocarditis, osteomyelitis, pneumonia, or toxic shock syndrome [ 1].
1: It is notorious for its ability to quickly become resistant to any antibiotic, which makes this bacterium one of the most serious pathogens in humans, and its treatment is often difficult [ 2].
2: In humans,  S. aureus can occur as both a benign commensal and a harmful pathogen.
3: Besides being a common colonizer of the skin, it also asymptomatically and permanently colonizes the anterior nostrils of up to 30% of the normal human population [ 3, 4], which is widely considered to be a predisposition of invasive infection [ 5].
4: Since  S. aureus is a microorganism that is associated with a broad spectrum of infections affecting the respiratory tract, taking up antibiotics through inhalation could be one of its possible treatments.
5: Moreover, the combination of two or even more antibiotic agents may be used as a possible strategy for increasing efficiency in fighting  S. aureus-related diseases, including respiratory infections.
6: An example of such treatment is a combination of fosfomycin and tobramycin that is currently in the late-stage development of an inhalation therapy of cystic fibrosis [ 6, 7].
7: It was demonstrated that fosfomycin synergistically enhances the activity of tobramycin against a wide range of bacteria, including  S. aureus [ 6, 8].
8: However, inhalation of solid antimicrobial agents, as well as the use of inhaler devices, may often be problematic, especially in children and the elderly [ 9].
9: Therefore, there is a need to search for new antimicrobial agents to combat bacteria affecting the respiratory tract and for easier ways how to deliver antimicrobials into the lower respiratory tract.
