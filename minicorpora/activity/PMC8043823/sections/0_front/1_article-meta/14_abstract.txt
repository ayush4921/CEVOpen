0: Background and Objectives:Escherichia coli and some    Salmonella serovars cause various disease manifestations in poultry leading to significant economic losses.
1: The widespread and imprudent use of antibacterial agents in poultry flocks have increased resistant to many antibacterial agents which has become a major public health concern.
2: Some medicinal plants may be alternative to antibacterial agents.
3: The purpose of this study was to investigate the antibacterial and anti-biofilm activity of summer savory essential oil against    E. coli and    Salmonella isolated from poultry.
4: Materials and Methods:The essential oil was extracted using a Clevenger apparatus and subsequently its compounds were determined using GC-MS. Antibacterial properties of essential oil were determined by disc diffusion method, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC).
5: To evaluate the anti-biofilm properties the Microtiter plate test was used.
6: Herbal essential oil was extracted and its compounds were identified correctly.Results:The major components of    Satureja hortensis essential oil were thymol (41.28%), -terpinene (37.63%), p-cymene (12.2%) and -terpinene (3.52%).
7: The inhibition zone diameter in the disc diffusion test for    E. coli and    Salmonella were 32  3 and 38  4 mm, respectively, which was confirmed by MIC and MBC values.
8: Regarding anti-biofilm activity, the MIC/2 concentration of    S. hortensis significantly inhibited biofilm formation of    E. coli.
9: However, inhibition of biofilm formation of    Salmonella was shown at concentration of MIC/2 and MIC/4.
10: Conclusion:Based on our results,    S. hortensis essential oil showed the growth inhibition and bactericidal activity against    E. coli and    Salmonella.
11: Moreover, this study demonstrated anti-biofilm activity of    S. hortensis essential against both tested bacteria.
