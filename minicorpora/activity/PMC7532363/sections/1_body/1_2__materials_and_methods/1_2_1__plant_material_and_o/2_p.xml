<p>The babassu oil was extracted from the dried kernels (250 g) using a benchtop oil expeller (Piteba®, the Netherlands), without heating. To remove solid impurities, the oil was centrifuged at 2,000 g for 10 min, yielding 34%. For all in vitro assays, babassu oil was weighted and a stock solution was prepared in DMSO (maximal final concentration of 0.5%).</p>
