<p>Babassu (
 <italic>Attalea speciosa</italic> Mart. ex Spreng., Arecaceae) fruits were collected by the botanist Alexandre Gomes da Silva in the Catimbau National Park, Buíque, Pernambuco (08° 37′ 23″ S; 37° 09′ 21″ O) in March 2016 (SISBIO authorization no. 26,743-3). A voucher specimen was identified by O. Cano and deposited in the Herbarium Dárdano de Andrade Lima (IPA no. 90,472). Governmental authorization to access the traditional knowledge associated to the uses of babassu was also obtained (SISGEN no. A&amp;D&amp;D31). Babassu coconuts were broken using a hatchet (Tramontina®A&amp;Brazil) to remove the kernels, which were dried in a forced-air oven at 40ºC for 24 h.
