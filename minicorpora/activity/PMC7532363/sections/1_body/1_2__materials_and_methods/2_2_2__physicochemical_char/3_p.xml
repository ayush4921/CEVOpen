<p>The samples were analyzed using an Agilent Technologies 7890 Gas Chromatograph coupled with a Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID) (Palo Alto, CA, USA) equipped with a nonpolar DB-5 ms column (30 m length × 250 
 <italic>μ</italic>m diameter × 0.25 
 <italic>μ</italic>m). The oven was initially held at 150°C for 4 min, increased to 280°C by 4 °C/min. The final temperature was maintained for 5 min. The carrier gas was helium supplied at a constant flow of 1 mL/min, and 1 
 <italic>µ</italic>L sample was automatically injected in split mode (100 : 1) with the injector maintained at 300°C. A standard fatty acid methyl ester mixture (Supelco®, 37 Component FAME Mix, Bellefonte, PA, USA) was used to identify the fatty acid methyl esters.
