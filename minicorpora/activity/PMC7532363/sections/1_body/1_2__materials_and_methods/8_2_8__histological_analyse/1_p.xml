<p>Wounds and ear samples were fixed in 10%-buffered formalin overnight, dehydrated in increasing concentrations of ethanol, diaphanized in xylene, embedded in paraffin, and cut into 5 
 <italic>µ</italic>m slides, which were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) or Masson's trichrome (MT) and analyzed using an Axiostar Plus optical microscope (Leica, Germany). For the histomorphometric analysis, twenty microphotographs were taken per slide. For wound samples, inflammatory cells (neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages), fibroblasts, and blood vessels were quantified in HE-stained slides, while collagen (%) was quantified in MT-stained slides. For ear samples, dermis and epidermis thickness were measured. Both analyses were performed using ImageJ v1.52 (NIH, MD, USA) with the plugins “cell counter” and “cell deconvolution”.
