<p>To assess the wound healing activity of babassu oil, a splinting full-thickness wound model in rats was used. The animals were anesthetized with xylazine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) and ketamine (100 mg/kg, i.p.) and had the dorsal hair removed using a clipper followed by a depilatory cream. Two full-thickness wounds were made in each rat using a 6 mm diameter biopsy punch, and then two silicone rings were sutured around the wounds to prevent wound contraction [

 <sup>rd</sup>, 7
 <sup>th</sup>, and 14
 <sup>th</sup> days, four rats from each group were euthanized, and the wound was removed for histological analysis.
