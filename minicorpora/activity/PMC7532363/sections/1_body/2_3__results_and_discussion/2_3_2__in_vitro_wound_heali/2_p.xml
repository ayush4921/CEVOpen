<p>In vitro, babassu oil was not cytotoxic in concentrations up to 100 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/mL for both L929 fibroblasts and murine peritoneal macrophages (MPMs). However, concentrations above 25 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/mL cause an increase in MTT metabolism in L929 cells, which could indicate cell proliferation. This effect was not observed in MPM, which may be beneficial to prevent switching to unfavorable phenotypes, delaying the wound healing process [

 <italic>µ</italic>g/mL, as shown by the smaller areas under the curve (AUC) in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(a)</xref> and by the representative microphotographs shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(b)</xref>. Ibrahim et al. [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] showed a similar effect of fermented virgin coconut oil (FVCO) in human normal colonic fibroblasts (CCD-18) at concentrations between 3.12 and 25 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/mL, without any signals of cytotoxicity. In addition, the authors showed that at 6.25 and 12.5 µg/mL, FVCO also increased the formation of new blood vessels in an ex vivo model. Guidoni et al. [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] evaluated the wound healing potential of a vegetable oil blend of flaxseed oil (15%), blackcurrant oil (10%), olive oil (20%), rosehip oil (10%), macadamia oil (15%), and sunflower oil (30%). In the scratch, this oil blend increased fibroblast migration in a concentration-depended manner up to 200 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/mL.
