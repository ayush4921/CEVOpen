<p>Despite some criticism on using in vitro assays as single models to study wound healing, a variety of relevant tests can be combined as a first screening to avoid the unnecessary use of laboratory animals. The healing of wounds involves many processes such as inflammation, cell proliferation, matrix deposition, and necessity of limiting oxidative stress and the proliferation of pathogens [

Here, it was decided to evaluate the effects of babassu oil on fibroblast migration and macrophage production of nitric oxide and cytokines and its radical scavenging and antimicrobials activities. Both antioxidant and antimicrobial activities were not found in relevant concentrations (data not shown), differently from those described by Nobre et al. [

 <italic>µ</italic>g/mL for different drug-resistant 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> isolates from surgical wounds. The difference in the antibacterial activity of these two babassu oils is probably due to the fatty acids with ten or fewer carbon atoms, such as caproic (C6:0), caprylic (C8:0), and capric (C10 : 0) acids. These fatty acids correspond to 20.3% of the solvent-extracted oil described by Nobre et al. [
