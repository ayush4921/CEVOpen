<p>The use of medicinal plants and their derivatives is increasing, and approximately one-third of all traditional herbal medicines are intended for wound treatment [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Due to the facility to obtain and the desirable physicochemical properties, oils are one of the most common medicinal preparations used in traditional medicine around the world. Medicinal oils may be from vegetal, animal, and mineral sources or evenly herbal oily extracts made from different plant organs [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. As a significant part of the vegetable oils, babassu oil is extracted from the dried kernels by cold pressing, and due to its high lauric acid content, it is very stable to oxidation, as evidenced by its peroxide and rancidity values (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Besides its physicochemical properties, the fatty acid profile of the babassu oil was also determined, and it was evident that there were not marked composition differences with the data reported in the literature, lauric, oleic, and myristic acids being the major compounds found (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), as described by De Oliveira et al. [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Zinc and calcium levels, which play an important role in wound healing, were determined by ICP-OES at &lt; 4.85 and 18.0, respectively. Both minerals are found in babassu kernels at levels up to 28.5 mg/kg for zinc [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and 457.5 mg/kg for calcium [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The relative low concentrations of both divalent cations in the oil confirm the low amount of free fatty acids, as shown in
