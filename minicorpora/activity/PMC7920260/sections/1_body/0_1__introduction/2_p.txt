0: Extracts of the MLs have been utilized for traditional medicines to cure diabetes, bronchitis, diarrhea, asthma, kidney, scabies, respiratory problems, syphilis, and urinary disorders [ 2, 3].
1: The most active biological constituent of MLs is mangiferin, followed by phenolic acids, benzophenones, and other antioxidants such as flavonoids, carotenoids, quercetin, isoquercetin, ascorbic acid, and tocopherols.
2: Mangiferin is the main contributor of most of the biological activities of MLs extract.
3: MLs have a great scope of valorization as they are recognized to possess varied phytochemical, biological, and pharmacological properties, viz.
4: anti-microbial, antioxidant, anti-diabetic, anti-tumour, and immunomodulatory effects.
5: ML oil (MLO) contains monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, minor quantities of other analogues, and trace amounts of non-terpenoid hydrocarbons and oxygenated hydrocarbons.
6: The essential oil from MLs also possesses bacteriostatic properties and contains several antimicrobial constituents such as -gurjunene, trans-caryophyllene, -humulene, -selinene, and camphor.
7: The benzophenone derivatives in MLs possess significant  -glucosidase inhibitory and immunosuppressive activities.
8: There are several reviews that have been developed to discuss the bioactive compounds and health promoting effect of mango fruit/pulp [ 4, 5, 6, 7], whereas others contain a scattered compilation of literature on mango seeds, MLs, and mango bark [ 8, 9].
