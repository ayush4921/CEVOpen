<p>Cancer is one of the most prevalent global threats after cardiovascular disease. Thus, there is an imperative need to undertake novel treatment strategies to counter this global issue. Polyphenols present in MLs like gallotannins, phenolic acids, quercetin, and mangiferin exhibit chemo-preventive effects against various cancer types due to their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects [
 <xref rid="B35-antioxidants-10-00299" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Antitumoral activities of MLs extract are mainly attributed to the primary bioactive xanthone glucoside, mangiferin. These compounds are demonstrated to suppress several cancers by impeding their invasion, migration, and proliferation [

Mangiferin is found to overturn the transition from epithelial-to-mesenchymal in MCF7 breast cancer cell lines by inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin pathway and by downregulating the expression of specific enzymes (5′Nucleotidase, γ-GT, and aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase) in lung cancer bearing albino mice [

 <sub>2</sub>/M phase. It was also found to instigate Nrf2-mediated antioxidant activities at a concentration of 50 μM, with no influence of myeloid leukaemia cell sensitivity to chemotherapeutics [

 <xref rid="B40-antioxidants-10-00299" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The anti-invasive and antimetastatic activities of mangiferin could also be attributed to its ability to regulate the expression of metalloproteinases, which determines the cell proliferation and inhibits epithelial–mesenchymal transition, eventually causing a loss in cell adhesion.
