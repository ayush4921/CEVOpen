<p>Yakubu et al. [
 <xref rid="B86-antioxidants-10-00299" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>] reported antidiarrheal activity of aqueous extract of MLs in female albino rats. They observed that the leaves sample was rich in phytochemicals like flavonoids, saponins, phenolics, and alkaloids. The dose level of 25 and 50 mg/kg body weight reduced the total quantity of wet feces and enhanced the reticence of evacuations. MLs extract demonstrated the most visible antidiarrheal activity at a concentration of 100 mg/kg of body weight, where the situation of diarrhea was prevented exponentially, with an increase in dose level reduced the multitudes and capacity of intestinal fluid. Ricinoleic acid from castor oil has been utilized as a diarrhea stimulating agent in various studies on rat models. Ricinoleic acid inhibits the activity of Na
 <sup>+</sup> â€“K
 <sup>+</sup> ATPase in the gut and reduces the active absorption of Na
 <sup>+</sup> and K
 <sup>+</sup>. Extracts at different concentrations tremendously enhanced the Na
 <sup>+</sup>-K
 <sup>+</sup> ATPase potential in the small intestine, which is one of the mechanisms of MLs extracts to act as an antidiarrheal agent.
