<p>Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder that badly disturbs the health and quality of human life and is established as the foremost threat to society irrespective of geographical locations. Diabetes is characterized by elevated glucose or above-normal glucose level (70–110 mg/dL), which are partially due to oxidative damage to pancreatic β-cells, leading to a decline in insulin secretion [

All over the world, researchers are exploring medicinal plants as an effective way to cure this debilitating disorder, because medicinal plants are a rich source of bioactive constituents, and most of them are known to be potent against DM.
