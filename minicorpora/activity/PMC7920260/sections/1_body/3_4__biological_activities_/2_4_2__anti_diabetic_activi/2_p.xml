<p>MLs have been widely claimed as effective ethnomedicine against DM due to their anti-diabetic bioactive constituents like benzophenones (mangiferin) and flavonoids (quercetin and its glucoside forms). One of the best effective approaches in the cure of DM is the inhibition of α-amylase and α-glucosidase enzymes, which regulate postprandial glucose absorption [
 <xref rid="B47-antioxidants-10-00299" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. A comparative analysis of mangiferin and MLs extract was done to check the efficiency of each extract to inhibit α-glucosidase enzymes. MLs extracts at a concentration of 100, 250, and 500 mg/mL caused up to 77.8%, 83.4%, and 95.7% inhibition of α-glucosidase, respectively. At the same time, mangiferin at a concentration of 10, 25, and 50 resulted in 86.85%, 92.35%, and 99.11% inhibition of α-glucosidase, respectively. It can be inferred that mangiferin is an active ingredient in the inhibition of α-glucosidase enzyme activity and in managing the diabetic condition [

 <xref rid="B42-antioxidants-10-00299" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] evaluated the anti-diabetic activity of mangiferin and MLs extract through the inhibition of α-glucosidase and α-amylase in vitro. Authors reported that mangiferin showed strong inhibition of rat α-glucosidase with a median inhibitory concentration IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 433.3 µg/mL and MLs extract showed potent inhibition of yeast α-glucosidase with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 50.3 µg/mL. Saleem et al. [
 <xref rid="B49-antioxidants-10-00299" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] evaluated the anti-diabetic potential of MLs extract (550, 750, 950 mg/kg) cv. Ratol in alloxan monohydrate (150 mg/kg) induced diabetes in albino mice. Authors found that the administration of MLs extract in chemically induced diabetic mice reduced the postprandial glucose level, prevented the surge of glucose in the blood, and improved the lipid profile along with body weight. Different bioactive compounds have been isolated from the MLs extract and demonstrated their anti-diabetic potential. Gu et al. [
 <xref rid="B31-antioxidants-10-00299" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] isolated and characterized four bioactive compounds as manindicins A and B, mangiferin, and norathyriol (deglycosylated mangiferin) from MLs extract. Authors revealed that norathyriol exhibited strong α-glucosidase inhibition with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 4.22 ± 0.19 μg/mL, which was four-fold effective with respect to commercial inhibitor acarbose (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 16.28 ± 1.22 μg/mL), while mangiferin (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 32.11 ± 2.01 μg/mL) and manindicin A (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: &gt;300 μg/mL) and B (&gt;300 μg/mL) displayed weaker α-glucosidase inhibition. The less inhibitory potential of Mangiferin may be due to its molecular size and polarity. The replacement of glucose moiety with hydrogen may weaken the steric hindrance during mangiferin–enzyme interaction and enhance the inhibitory potential of mangiferin towards α-glucosidase [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-10-00299-f003">Figure 3</xref>. The anti-diabetic potential of mangiferin was also demonstrated, as it increases insulin sensitivity and inhibits α-glucosidase [
 <xref rid="B50-antioxidants-10-00299" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Similarly, for quercetin, α-glucosidase inhibition was substantially higher than that of its 3-O-glucoside hyperoside [

 <xref rid="B52-antioxidants-10-00299" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] investigated the anti-diabetic activity of tender and mature leaves of totapuri cultivar of mango, and authors found that tender leaves extract (500 mg/kg) efficiently inhibited the α-amylase with IC
 <sub>50</sub> 22.01 µg/mL, while mature leaf extract (500 mg/kg) exhibited the α-glucosidase inhibition with IC
 <sub>50</sub> 21.03 µg/mL. Findings suggest that bioactive compounds from the ML can be effective in reducing the risk of diabetes.
