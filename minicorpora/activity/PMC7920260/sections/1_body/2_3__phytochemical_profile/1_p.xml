<p>Generally, MLs are burnt or discarded, considered as an agricultural crop waste. However, the medicinal properties of MLs make them a useful ingredient in traditional folk tea preparation, and to treat diabetes and respiratory diseases in Asian and African countries [

Bioactive phytochemicals present in MLs extracts have a high potential in terms of biological and pharmacological activities viz. antioxidant, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antiviral, immunomodulatory, anti-obesity, antiallergic, antifungal, antiparasitic, antidiarrheal, antipyretic, and anti-tumour activities [

 <xref rid="B27-antioxidants-10-00299" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Phytochemicals present in MLs can be broadly categorized as polyphenols, terpenoids, carbohydrates, sterols, carotenoids, vitamins, fatty acids, and amino acids. Among them, total phenolic compounds (TPC), including phenolic acids, xanthones, benzophenones, tannins, terpenoids, and flavonoids, are most abundant in ML. Several epidemiological studies have proved the activities of TPC against chronic diseases viz. cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases [
