<p>One of the major biomacromolecules studied in mango leaves is protein. Protein acts as a building block of cell and also plays a major role in growth, maintenance, enzyme regulation, cell signaling, and also acts as biocatalyst [

 <sup>−1</sup> DM) to determine performance, nutrient utilization, and carcass evaluation of growing rabbit [

These can be utilized as an alternative source of livestock feeding in developing countries for alleviating food shortage for livestock. Proximate composition of MLs showed 13.6% of CP in dauphiné Mauritian variety, 20.38% CP in Nigerian variety, and 6.90% CP in Laos variety [

Varietal difference of leaf protein was also studied in five different cultivars of mango (Pusa Arunima, Pusa Surya, Amrapali, Mallika, and Dushehari) grafted on three different rootstocks (K-5, Kurakkan, and Olour), and it was found that Amrapali on K-5 rootstock has higher leaf protein (146.47 mg g
 <sup>−1</sup> fresh weight) followed by Amrapali on Olour rootstock (145.22 mg g
 <sup>−1</sup> fresh weight). Hence, this study showed a significant effect of rootstocks on protein content in MLs [
