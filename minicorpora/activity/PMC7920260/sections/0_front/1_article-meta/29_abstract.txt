0: Mangifera indica L. belongs to the family of Anacardiaceae and is an important fruit from South and Southeast Asia.
1: India, China, Thailand, Indonesia, Pakistan, Mexico, Brazil, Bangladesh, Nigeria, and the Philippines are among the top mango producer countries.
2: Leaves of the mango plant have been studied for their health benefits, which are attributed to a plethora of phytochemicals such as mangiferin, followed by phenolic acids, benzophenones, and other antioxidants such as flavonoids, ascorbic acid, carotenoids, and tocopherols.
3: The extracts from mango leaves (MLs) have been studied for their biological activities, including anti-cancer, anti-diabetic, anti-oxidant, anti-microbial, anti-obesity, lipid-lowering, hepato-protection, and anti-diarrheal.
4: In the present review, we have elaborated on the nutritional and phytochemical profile of the MLs.
5: Further, various bioactivities of the ML extracts are also critically discussed.
6: Considering the phytochemical profile and beneficial effects of the MLs, they can be used as a potential ingredient for the development of functional foods and pharmaceutical drugs.
7: However, more detailed clinical trials still needed to be conducted for establishing the actual efficacy of the ML extracts.
