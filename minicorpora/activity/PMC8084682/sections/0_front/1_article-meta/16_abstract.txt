0: Momordica charantia (MC) is popular for its medicinal uses especially for treating diabetic-related complications.
1: However, the antiulcer activity of essential oil derived from the seeds has not been systematically studied.
2: This study aims to evaluate the gastroprotective activities of essential oil derived from the seed of MC induced by hydrochloride acid/ethanol (HCl/EtOH) and indomethacin and pylorus-ligation model.
3: Gastric ulceration was induced by oral administration of HCl/EtOH solution or indomethacin on day 7 after animals have been pretreated with testing compounds.
4: The first group received just distilled water and the second group received ranitidine (100 mg/kg).
5: Groups 3, 4, and 5 received 10, 50, and 100 mg/kg of essential oil based on their body weight (10 mL/kg), respectively.
6: Macroscopically, pretreatment of essential oil extracted from MC significantly decreased ulceration induced by HCl/EtOH and indomethacin   in vivo.
7: Microscopically, essential oil also significantly suppressed the formation of edema, epithelial disruption, and mucosa erosions.
8: Moreover, essential oil significantly elevated the pH without decreasing the total acidity of the gastric juice and was able to increase the amount of adherent mucus compared to control.
9: Current results provide scientific basis to the ethno-pharmacological usage of the MC in preventing ulcer formation induced by HCl/EtOH and indomethacin.
