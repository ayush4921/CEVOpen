0: Background and Aim:The use of antimicrobials in the control of mastitis is of concern in public health due to their inefficiency in targeting microorganisms.
1: Studies with medicinal plants have risen as an alternative to the use of conventional products.
2: The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of an experimental disinfectant based on the essential oil (EO) from    Lippia origanoides in preventing the development of new intramammary infections (IMI) in Holstein cows.
3: Materials and Methods:The conventional protocol of pre- and post-milking was used and the control (Conventional treatment [CNV]) and experimental (Experimental treatment [PEX]) products containing EO at 120 L/mL were applied by immersion.
4: Individual milk samples were analyzed using sheep blood agar methodologies and biochemical tests.
5: The efficiency of the treatment was defined by the presence or absence of    Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative    Staphylococcus, and    Streptococcus spp.
6: Results:There were no clinical and subclinical mastitis cases, no lesions in the mucosal of teats, nor dirt score between groups in this study.
7: Both treatments did not influence the occurrence of IMI.Conclusion:The results revealed that PEX acts efficiently against microorganisms compared to the disinfection by the conventional product demonstrating the efficacy of the alternative product on the prevention of new IMIs in dairy cows.
