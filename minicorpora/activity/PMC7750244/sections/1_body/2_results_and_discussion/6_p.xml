<p>A new product for the disinfection of teats based on copper and zinc (experimental teat disinfectant ZkinCu) was tested in a herd with an automatic milking mechanism to verify new intramammary cases under natural infections. The results of the study showed that the experimental teat disinfectant ZkinCu, evaluated in this field trial with naturally occurring IMI, showed non-inferiority relative to the positive control for the prevention of new IMI [

 <italic>Streptococcus uberis</italic>, 
 <italic>Corynebacterium</italic> spp., and coagulase-negative staphylococci in both the ZkinCu and OceanBlu groups. It was observed that the risk of infection in the OceanBlu group was higher (Î²=0.644; 95% confidence interval=0.05.1.22). The interaction of treatment by week was not significant. The new IMI rate estimates (95% confidence interval) for ZkinCu and OceanBlu were 1.7% (0.8.2.5) and 3.2% (1.7.4.7), respectively [
