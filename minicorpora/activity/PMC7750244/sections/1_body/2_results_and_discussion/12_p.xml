<p>The antimicrobial activity of crude ethanolic extract from the bark and leaves of 
 <italic>Commiphora leptophloeos</italic> against the isolates of 
 <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> spp. from the milk of ruminants with SCM was evaluated. The extracts of the bark and leaves at a concentration of 781.2 Î¼g/mL were able to interfere with the initial stages of biofilm formation; however, there was no interference of the extract on the established biofilm [

 <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> spp. isolates from SCM cases in ruminants when subjected to the extracts from the bark and leaves of 
 <italic>C. leptophloeos</italic>, with respect to the ability of extracts to interfere in biofilm formation, indicating their potential in use for ruminant mastitis therapy [
