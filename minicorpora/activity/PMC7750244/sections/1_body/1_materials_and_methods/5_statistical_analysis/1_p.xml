<p>The frequency and occurrence of 
 <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> spp. and 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic> spp. were evaluated using the two treatments in pre- and post-milking. The difference observed in the rate of IMI between treatments was calculated by the Qui-square test. The hypothesis used was that there were no significant differences between CNV and PEX pre- and post-milking in the reduction of natural infections [
