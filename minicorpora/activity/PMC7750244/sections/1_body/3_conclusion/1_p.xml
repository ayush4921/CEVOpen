<p>This study demonstrated that the experimental product based in 
 <italic>L. origanoides</italic> EO did not influence the rates of the clinical and subclinical diagnoses with respect to isolated SCNs and 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic> spp. The disinfectant product obtained demonstrated no inferiority to the conventional product and did not alter the rates of IMI induced by SNC and 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic> spp. presenting the same rates of IMI in positive control. Hence, it can be concluded that this product acts like the disinfectant used in conventional protocols of pre- and post-milking. The disinfection of utensils allows for the minimizing of economic losses caused by mastitis and increases food security. The results of this study suggest that the formulated product with 
 <italic>L. origanoides</italic> shows the potential to become an efficient alternative to conventional milking management and for the prevention of new IMI.
