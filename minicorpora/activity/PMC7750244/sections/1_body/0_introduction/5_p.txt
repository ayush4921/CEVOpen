0: Lippia origanoides, whose EO is extracted from its leaves, is a shrub native to the semi-arid regions of Minas Gerais, and it has antimicrobial activity [ 10].
1: Chromatography combined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (CG-EM) has been used to elucidate the chemical composition of the EO of  L. origanoides.
2: The most important constituents identified were carvacrol (ranging from 29% to 32%), followed by o-cymene (23% to 25.57%) and methyl thymol ether (10.03% to 11.50%) [ 10, 11].
3: These compounds have shown antimicrobial activity against  S. aureus and  Streptococcus mutans [ 10- 12], the most prevalent microorganisms in mastitis.
4: A concentration of 120 L/mL of  L. origanoides EO inhibited the growth of  Escherichia coli,  S. aureus, and  Salmonella choleraesuis without causing cellular toxicity [ 10].
5: At the same concentration, the EO presented antiseptic activity against these microorganisms and inhibited their growth after 5 min (for  S. aureus) or 15 min (for  S. choleraesuis) of treatment [ 11].
6: These studies suggest that the  L. origanoides EO can be used to formulate antiseptic products capable of slowing microbial growth.
