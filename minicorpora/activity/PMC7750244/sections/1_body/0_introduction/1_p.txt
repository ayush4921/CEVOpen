0: Mastitis is a major economic problem for the dairy industry and the predominant causes of bovine mastitis are intramammary infections (IMI) with bacteria [ 1].
1: Expenses with respect to the prevention or treatment of mastitis and losses due to low milk production or disposal of milk directly influence the revenue and profitability in dairy herds [ 1, 2].
2: Research has shown that the expenses of preventive treatment corresponded to a maximum of 13.5% of the economic impact [ 3].
3: This percentage was lower than the economic impact of the expenses of curative treatment.
4: Therefore, the control of mastitis on the property is an important factor in reducing milk contamination.
