<p>The effectiveness of EOs for the treatment of skin fungus has also been investigated through clinical interventions, in addition to in vitro and in vivo studies. In our review, we came across two interesting clinical research projects that had evaluated the antifungal activity of EOs originating from distinct plant species. In the first intervention, the antifungal activity of 
 <italic>M. communis</italic> EO against 
 <italic>Malassezia</italic> sp. isolated from the skin of patients with 
 <italic>Pityriasis versicolor</italic> was examined. 
 <italic>Malassezia</italic> sp. is a class of lipophilic yeasts that covers part of the skin microflora in humans and other warm-blooded animals [

However, the presence of this yeast is also known to lead to diseases such as inflammation, systemic infections or uninflamed lesions. Among these, uninflamed lesions in the presence of excess fungal load represent a disease known as 
 <italic>Pityriasis versicolor</italic> (PV) [

 <xref rid="B135-molecules-26-01093" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>]. PV is sometimes also known as tinea versicolor, and is characterized by the development of hypo or hyperpigmented scaly spots [
