<p>Chemical characterization of the oil indicated the presence of terpinolene, Î±-phellendren, terpinen-4-ol and sabinyl acetate as the main components. It was also noted that the oil destroyed both 
 <italic>M. gypseum</italic> and 
 <italic>T. mentagrophytes</italic> within 5 s. In addition, antifungal activity of the oil was observed with other species such as 
 <italic>E. floccosum, M. nanum, T. rubrum</italic> and 
 <italic>T. violaceum.</italic> This study highlighted the significant potential of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> leaf EO based on in vitro and in vivo assays; additionally, strong fungicidal action, extended shelf-life, tolerability of higher inoculum density, thermal stability and a wider range of antidermatophytic activity without any adverse effects were noted. Intervention studies that involved the topical application of the oil formulation gave positive insights into its efficacy; complete healing was observed in 72% of cases after three weeks of treatment, without any relapse when patients were examined two months later. Hence, the study proposed the application of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> leaf EO as an inexpensive and effective formulation for commercial use [
