<p>The current practice in the treatment of fungal infections is solely focused on the application of traditional antifungal agents. However, as new species of fungi emerge, different approaches are necessary, given the increased resistance toward commonly available antifungal medications. Based on extensive research performed on EOs, the potential of these oils for antifungal based therapies has gained huge attention in recent years. Our review highlights numerous studies that have evaluated the potential of various types of EOs against human pathogenic fungi that were examined via in vitro, in vivo as well as clinical research. The listed research articles were also defined and classified as conventional and nonconventional, where applicable.</p>
