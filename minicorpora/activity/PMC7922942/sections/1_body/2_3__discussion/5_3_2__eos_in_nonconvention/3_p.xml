<p>Another study screened the potential of nine EOs, where 
 <italic>B. serrata</italic> was cited for its superior activity, with maximal activity against 
 <italic>Trichophyton</italic> spp. 
 <italic>B. serrata</italic> EO was reported to contain mostly of 
 <italic>α</italic>-thujene, 
 <italic>ρ</italic>-cymene and sabinene compounds. The synergistic activity demonstrated with azoles in azole-resistant 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> indicated the suitability of this oil for use as an antifungal agent. However, as the study was limited in terms of its examination of the mechanism of action, individual constituent analyses and clinical studies, further investigations were deemed necessary [

Similarly, the antifungal activity of several EOs (black pepper, cardamom, cumin, Boswellia and Patcholi) were examined in another study against fluconazole-resistant fungi. The results revealed the effectiveness of Boswellia and Cardamom oil against 
 <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> and 
 <italic>T. mentagrophytes</italic>, respectively. Furthermore, a synergistic effects of a combination of Boswellia EO and fluconazole was noted, revealing itself to be the most effective of the applied approaches against 
 <italic>C. tropicalis</italic>, even at 1:10 dilution and 100 μg/mL, respectively. As indicated by Sadhasivam and colleagues [
 <xref rid="B78-molecules-26-01093" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>], an earlier study also proposed that the active compound, action mechanism, toxicity and stability be the focus of future investigations [
