<p>Cabral and colleagues evaluated the antifungal potential of 
 <italic>Juniperus communis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>alpina</italic> (Suter) Celak needles EO [
 <xref rid="B75-molecules-26-01093" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. 
 <italic>J. communis</italic> L. is an evergreen shrub or tree with fleshy female cones, where the cone scales resemble berries; it occurs throughout Europe, Asia and North America [
 <xref rid="B106-molecules-26-01093" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. The evaluation of juniper needle oil revealed excellent activity, in particular to 
 <italic>M. canis</italic> and 
 <italic>T. rubrum</italic>, with MIC and minimum lethal concentrations (MLC) of 0.32 μL/mL [
 <xref rid="B75-molecules-26-01093" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. The oil was made up largely of monoterpene hydrocarbons (78.4%), with the main components being sabinene (26.2%), α-pinene (12.9%) and limonene (10.4%). Cell viability studies indicated the superiority of needle oil with no cytotoxic effects observed in HaCat keratinocytes when tested at 0.32 and 0.64 μL/mL, compared to a previous study on berry EO [
