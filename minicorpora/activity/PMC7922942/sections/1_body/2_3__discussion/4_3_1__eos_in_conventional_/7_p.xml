<p>In Lebanon, Lamiaceae species such as 
 <italic>C. capitatus</italic> L., 
 <italic>L. stoechas</italic> L., 
 <italic>L. angustifolia</italic> Mill., 
 <italic>M. spicata</italic> L. subsp. condensata, 
 <italic>O. syriacum</italic> L.,
 <italic> R. officinalis</italic>, 
 <italic>S. fruticosa</italic> Miller., 
 <italic>S. cuneifolia</italic> Ten., 
 <italic>S. thymbra</italic> L., 
 <italic>T. spicata</italic> L., and 
 <italic>V. agnus-castus</italic> L. are quite popular due to their use as a food, a condiment or as traditional medicine in the treatment gastrointestinal disorders and microbial infections. The EOs of Lamiaceae sp. was shown to be efficient, especially toward 
 <italic>T. rubrum</italic> and 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, that reported MIC values ranging between 64–128 µg/mL; this was attributed to the presence of large amounts of thymol and carvacrol components [

Linalool, β-caryophyllene, limonene, β-pinene, 1,8-cineole, carvacrol, α-pinene, p-cymene, γ-terpinene, and thymol were identified as the major components among the tested plants; these compounds are known to possess antifungal characteristics. On the whole, the review concluded that more than half of these EOs presented MIC activity (&lt;1000 μg/mL), with Clinopodium, Lavandula, Mentha, Thymbra and Thymus EOs displaying the best activities [
