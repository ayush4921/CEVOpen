<p>The properties of this oil with a wide spectrum of antifungal capacity were believed to be strongly influenced by its chemical composition, i.e., mostly phenolic compounds. Past research has suggested that alcohols, phenolic compounds or aldehydes are capable of preventing fungi and yeast growth [
 <xref rid="B114-molecules-26-01093" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. An in vivo study to evaluate the wound healing capacity of this EO was performed with Sprague-Dawley rats. Outstanding wound contraction rates were observed. This phenomenon was attributed to the presence of phytochemical compounds (phenolic compounds, flavonoids, terpenoids, alkaloids) which were reported previously to assist in wound contraction and facilitate epithelialization. Wound healing encompasses a critical step of increased proliferation and migration over the wound via re-epithelialization, that further strengthens this hypothesis [

 <italic>P. jacquemontiana</italic> oil was presented as an effective approach for wound healing, this group of researchers also proposed that extended studies with regards to the mechanism involved should be undertaken in the future [
