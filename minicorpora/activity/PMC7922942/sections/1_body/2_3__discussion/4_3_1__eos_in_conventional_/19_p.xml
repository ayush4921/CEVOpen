<p>An EO originating from 
 <italic>A. houstonianum Mill</italic> leaves was shown to be capable of inhibiting the growth of both 
 <italic>M. gypseum</italic> and 
 <italic>T. mentagrophytes</italic>, with MIC of 80 μg/mL. 
 <italic>A. houstonianum</italic> is an annual or biannual herb and a member of the Asteraceae family, that has been utilized as a traditional medicine in many countries. The MIC value of 
 <italic>A. houstonianum</italic> Mill EO when tested with multiple serial dilutions was 20 μg/mL for both (8:2) while 8 and 10 μg/mL value were obtained for 
 <italic>M. gypseum</italic> and 
 <italic>T. mentagrophytes</italic> (10:1), respectively. An in vivo study of the acute dermal toxicity effects with guinea pig indicated no changes in treated skin and fur, appearance along with the absence of diarrhea. In addition, dosage increase resulted in a reduction of noise sensitivity degree, pinch reaction, locomotion effects, as well as reactivity. However, a slight darkening of the liver, kidneys and heart was noticed with dosage increase. The observed effects indicated the suitability of 
 <italic>A. houstonianum</italic> EO as an antidermatophytic compound. This supported a previous hypothesis that this EO may have depressant or sedative effects on the CNS at high doses [
