<p>In another study, the capacity of 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic> fruits EO was demonstrated for antidermatophytic activity using Swiss Albino mice model. 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic> L. is a member of the Apiaceae family, that was known as an aromatic herb and spice grown in Egypt, Persia, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Ethiopia and India [

 <xref rid="B122-molecules-26-01093" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. Chemical profiling of the oil revealed thymol as the major component, at 58.88%, followed by p-cymene (24.02%) and γ-terpinene (13.77%). The MIC value of 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic> oil was noted in the range of 0.025–0.5 μL/mL against tested fungi. Maximum zone of inhibition was observed against 
 <italic>C. tropicum</italic> (63.83 ± 0.166 mm) followed by 
 <italic>T. simii</italic> (57 ± 0.288 mm), 
 <italic>T. rubrum</italic> (51.33 ± 0.333 mm) and 
 <italic>C. indicum</italic> (45 ± 0.577 mm). From a total of five concentrations tested, no irritations were observed at low concentrations, i.e., up to 3%, while three mice presented symptoms of mild erythema and all five mice exhibited well-defined erythema at 5% and 7% concentrations, respectively. This finding concluded that toxic side effects were not demonstrated at low concentrations. Based on the excellent antidermatophytic activity of the oil, 
 <italic>T. ammi</italic> EO could be potentially used in the treatment of tinea or ringworm infections [
