<p>Another study on the potential of EOs from 
 <italic>L. luisieri</italic> and 
 <italic>C. citratus</italic> against 
 <italic>T. rubrum</italic> and 
 <italic>T. mentagrophytes</italic> was conducted, whereby strong antifungal activity was observed with most clinical strains. Positive interaction between 
 <italic>L. luisieri</italic> EO combined with terbinafine was observed against terbinafine-resistant strain (Tr ATCC MYA-4438). Significant reduction of the germination was observed above 100 Âµg/mL. Both oils were found to be safe to macrophage mammalian cells at the tested concentrations. This study describes the antifungal activity of 
 <italic>L. luisieri</italic> and 
 <italic>C. citratus</italic> EOs against dermatophytes, which could be useful in the design of new formulations of topical treatments [
