<p>In another test against 
 <italic>T. rubrum</italic> and 
 <italic>T. mentagrophytes</italic>, the antifungal activities of 
 <italic>A. betulina</italic> and 
 <italic>C. album</italic> EOs was evaluated using electron microscopy based on the mechanism of action. It was found that fungal growth was inhibited on all plates exposed to the EOs volatiles with different inhibition rates observed among the various fungal species, EOs and tested volumes. The highest inhibition was recorded on 
 <italic>T. rubrum</italic> at 40 Î¼L via the action of 
 <italic>A. betulina</italic> EO, with a fungal growth index (FGI) of 2.3% indicating its capacity as a strong antifungicidal agent. The hyphae and spores of 
 <italic>T. rubrum</italic> were also destroyed due to the volatile effects. The major components identified in 
 <italic>A. betulina</italic> EO are limonene (29.8%), menthone (21.6%), and isomenthone (14.7%), while pinene (27.4%) and myrcene (14.5%) makes up the major part of 
 <italic>C. album</italic> [

 <italic>C. album</italic> (Thunb) Bart. &amp; H. L. Wendl (Rutaceae) has been used by the Khoisan people by rubbing it on their skin. However, it is less popular in South Africa as a traditional medicine. The mechanism of action of 
 <italic>A. betulina</italic> EO volatiles was shown to be through spore growth inhibition as well as production and morphology alteration via destruction of hyphae and spores. Overall, this research gave remarkable insights into the possible use of 
 <italic>A. betulina</italic> as an antifungal agent [
