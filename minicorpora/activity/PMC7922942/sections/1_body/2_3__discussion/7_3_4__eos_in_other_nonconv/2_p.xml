<p>Pickering emulsions (PEs) are widely sought after at present, compared to conventional emulsions. PEs comprise particle-stabilized emulsions in which solid particles tend to adsorb instantly on the oil-water interface, resulting in a shell-like structure on the PE droplet surface. There are various advantages associated with the PE approach, e.g., improved stability in relation to the higher adsorption energy of solid particles, as well as appropriate emulsion droplet size, that could assist in longer retention of the antifungal drug at the treatment site. The approach of PE was demonstrated in one study that evaluated its effectiveness as an alternative therapy for onychomycosis topical treatment, also known as fungal nail infections. For this purpose, a nanotechnological approach was applied to formulate PEs in combination with azole derivative (tioconazole) and
