 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> spp. is a filamentous and ubiquitous fungi with 
 <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> as the major species associated with human disease, followed by 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic>, 
 <italic>A. niger</italic> and 
 <italic>A. terreus</italic> [

 <xref rid="B8-molecules-26-01093" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-26-01093" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In addition to the most common species, several other emerging species exist, including 
 <italic>A. clavatus</italic>, 
 <italic>A. nidulans</italic>, 
 <italic>A. glaucus</italic> and 
 <italic>A. ustus</italic> [

 <xref rid="B9-molecules-26-01093" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> spp. are other fungi that can cause human infections, and are the primary cause of fungal keratitis. This fungus is the second most common to infect severely immunocompromised patients and cause disseminated infection [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-26-01093" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. 
 <italic>F. solani</italic> has been identified as the most frequent pathogen in fusarial keratitis incidence, while 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> leads to major incidences of onychomycosis [

 <xref rid="B13-molecules-26-01093" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. 
 <italic>Candida</italic> spp. are tiny, oval-shaped fungi with a thin cell wall that are capable of budding or fission. Among the identified species, five are the leading cause of invasive infections (
 <italic>C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicals</italic> and, 
 <italic>C. krusei</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-26-01093" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Invasive candidiasis often occurs as a form of healthcare-associated infection, where affected patients are typically receiving broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment, immunosuppressants, or suffering from cancer [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-26-01093" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Candidiasis infections typically exist on the epithelial surfaces of the mouth, gastrointestinal tract, vagina and skin surfaces. 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> remains the most common cause of skin, nail and mucous membrane infections in healthy individuals, in whom it may also induce more severe infections of the vital organs [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-26-01093" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-26-01093" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].
