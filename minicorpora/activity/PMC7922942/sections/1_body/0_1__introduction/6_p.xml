<p>Fungal infections arising from 
 <italic>Candida</italic> spp. are called candidiasis; the most commonly implicated species is 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Fluconazole and itraconazole are widely utilized for such infections, but these agents have caused azole resistance within 
 <italic>Candida</italic> spp. [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-26-01093" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-26-01093" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-26-01093" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The antifungal properties of EOs derived from 
 <italic>Melaleuca</italic> sp., 
 <italic>Origanum</italic> sp., 
 <italic>Thymus</italic> sp., 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> sp., 
 <italic>Syzgium</italic> sp., 
 <italic>Coriandrum</italic> sp., 
 <italic>Cuminum</italic> sp. and several others against 
 <italic>Candida</italic> spp. were noted [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-26-01093" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. 
 <italic>Melaleuca</italic> sp. is the main genus to have been studied for its anticandida properties. In a study by Mondello and colleagues, it was observed that 
 <italic>C. krusei</italic> and 
 <italic>C. gabrata</italic> showed sensitivity towards 
 <italic>M. alternifolia</italic> EO; additionally, all azole resistant 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> were killed within 30 and 60 min at 1% and 0.25% concentration, respectively [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-26-01093" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Antifungal activity was also observed from 
 <italic>T. pulegiosides</italic> EO, that inhibited 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, 
 <italic>C. glabrata</italic>, 
 <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic>, 
 <italic>C. krusei</italic> and 
 <italic>C. guillermondii</italic> with a MIC value range of 0.32–0.64 μL/mL [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-26-01093" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Peppermint EO is also highly capable as an antifungal agent. Studies have revealed its inhibition capacity against 
 <italic>Candida</italic> spp., dermatophytes and 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> spp. when tested within 40–7000, 800–3500 and 400–3500 μg/mL, respectively [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-26-01093" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. 
 <italic>Lavandula angustifolia</italic>, or lavender EO has also exhibited excellent antifungal activity against 
 <italic>Candida</italic> spp. [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-26-01093" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-26-01093" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. 
 <italic>Cumin</italic> EO effectiveness as an antifungal agent has also been proven with respect to 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, resulting in MIC values of 3.90 and 11.71 μg/mL [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-26-01093" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].
