0: However, the treatment of fungal infections has encountered serious difficulties in the form of increased resistance due to the extensive use of antifungal agents.
1: This situation has led to the insight that alternative, nonconventional approaches are required for effective antifungal treatment strategies.
2: One of the possible directions proposed is the use of essential oils (EOs) as potential antifungal agents.
3: EOs can be extracted from various plant parts and are volatile, aromatic, concentrated, hydrophobic oily liquids.
4: Monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and phenolic compounds are the key components of EOs.
5: Phenolic compounds are chiefly responsible for the antimicrobial properties of Eos [ 20].
6: Numerous studies have proven the efficacy of EOs in antifungal treatments, although not all have addressed the underlying mechanisms of action [ 21].
7: The most widely used parameter in the antimicrobial assessment is minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC), i.e., the lowest antifungal agent concentration required to inhibit fungal growth or to kill mycetes, respectively [ 2, 22].
8: At present, thyme ( Thymus sp.
9: ), tea tree ( Melaleuca alternifolia), peppermint ( Mentha piperita) or clove oil ( Syzygium aromaticum) are the most widely tested EOs in terms of their antifungal activities [ 23, 24, 25, 26].
10: Nevertheless, examination of the potential of EOs has extended to other types of oils [ 27].
11: Several examples of the use of EOs in the treatment of fungal diseases are described below.
