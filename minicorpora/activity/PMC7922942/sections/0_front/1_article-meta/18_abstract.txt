0: Essential oils (EOs) are known to have varying degrees of antimicrobial properties that are mainly due to the presence of bioactive compounds.
1: These include antiviral, nematicidal, antifungal, insecticidal and antioxidant properties.
2: This review highlights the potential of EOs and their compounds for application as antifungal agents for the treatment of skin diseases via conventional and nonconventional approaches.
3: A search was conducted using three databases (Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar), and all relevant articles from the period of 20102020 that are freely available in English were extracted.
4: In our findings, EOs with a high percentage of monoterpenes showed strong ability as potential antifungal agents.
5: Lavandula sp.,   Salvia sp.,   Thymus sp.,   Citrus sp., and   Cymbopogon sp.
6: were among the various species found to show excellent antifungal properties against various skin diseases.
7: Some researchers developed advanced formulations such as gel, semi-solid, and ointment bases to further evaluate the effectiveness of EOs as antifungal agents.
8: To date, most studies on the application of EOs as antifungal agents were performed using in vitro techniques, and only a limited number pursued in vivo and intervention-based research.
