0: This study established the DNA barcoding sequences (  matK and   rbcL) of three plant species identified in the tribe Clauseneae, namely   Clausena excavata,   C. harmandiana and   Murraya koenigii.
1: The total phenolic and total flavonoid contents, together with the biological activities of the derived essential oils and methanol extracts, were also investigated.
2: Herein, the success of obtaining sequences of these plant using two different barcode genes   matK and   rbcL were 62.5% and 100%, respectively.
3: Both regions were discriminated by around 700 base pairs and these had resemblance with those of the Clausenae materials earlier deposited in Genbank at a 99100% degree of identity.
4: Additionally, the use of   matK DNA sequences could positively confirm the identity as monophyletic.
5: The highest total phenolic and total flavonoid content values (  p< 0.05) were observed in the methanol extract of   M. koenigii at 43.50 mg GAE/g extract and 66.13 mg QE/g extract, respectively.
6: Furthermore, anethole was detected as the dominant compound in   C. excavata (86.72%) and   C. harmandiana (46.09%).
7: Moreover, anethole (26.02%) and caryophyllene (21.15%) were identified as the major phytochemical compounds of   M. koenigii.
8: In terms of the biological properties, the   M. koenigii methanol extract was found to display the greatest amount of antioxidant activity (DPPH; IC  50 95.54 g/mL, ABTS value 118.12 mg GAE/g extract, FRAP value 48.15 mg GAE/g extract), and also revealed the highest   -glucosidase and antihypertensive inhibitory activities with percent inhibition values of 84.55 and 84.95.
9: Notably, no adverse effects on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were observed with regard to all of the plant extracts.
10: Furthermore,   M. koenigii methanol extract exhibited promise against human lung cancer cells almost at 80% after 24 h and 90% over 48 h.
