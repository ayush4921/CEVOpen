0: Over the last decades, molecular technique based on DNA sequence can be applied to the systematic identification of known and unknown plants and animals.
1: DNA barcoding, a modern method for the rapid identification of any species, is considered as a molecular and bioinformatics tool for species differentiation, identification and discovery of new species at molecular systematic level [ 16].
2: In terms of barcoding of vascular plants, it was mostly focused on markers of chloroplast genes, several markers were assessed and with time most commonly applied combinations are  rbcL,  matK,  trnH -psbA, with a nuclear internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) established [ 17, 18, 19, 20].
