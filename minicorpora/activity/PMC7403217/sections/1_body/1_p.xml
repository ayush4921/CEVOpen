The word “cosmeceuticals” has been coined to encompass that area which exists between the two aforementioned fields. Cosmeceuticals are hybrids that exist between drug and cosmetic products which are utilized to boost both skin health and beauty through their external and/or internal application.

This Research Topic included studies that provided scientific evidence for the advancement of phytochemicals and traditionally used plants as cosmeceuticals. It is anticipated that such studies will add to our understanding of the pharmacology and use of medicinal plants, fungi and other organisms used as cosmeceuticals through new and scientifically substantive knowledge.
