 <italic>Helichrysum odoratissimum</italic> to inhibit bacterial growth of 
 <italic>C. acnes</italic> and pathogenic virulence factors thereof. The extract exhibited antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic>C. acnes</italic> by showing high specificity against cell aggregation and preventing biofilm formation. Anti-inflammatory activity was observed by inhibiting cytokine levels of IL-8. This study validated the traditional use of 
 <italic>Impepho</italic> as an ointment for pimples, not only by controlling bacterial proliferation but also due to inhibitory activity on various virulence factors (
