The extracts were found to exert inhibitory effects on the secretion of inflammatory mediators. Hawaiian Kona exhibited inhibitory effects on the expression of three examined cytokines, whereas Ethiopian Yirgacheffe reduced the secretion of TNF-α and IL-6, and Costa Rican Tarrazu decreased the secretion of IL-6. The anti-inflammatory activity was correlated with 26 identified metabolites quantified by LCMS. Twelve of these had high relative intensities in all of the extracts. The presence of multiple anti-inflammatory compounds in SCG provided a promising natural source for cosmeceutical and pharmaceutical industries (
