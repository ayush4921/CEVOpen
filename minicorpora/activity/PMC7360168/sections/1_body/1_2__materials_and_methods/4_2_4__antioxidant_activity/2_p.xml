<p>The measurement of antiradical activity was tested using the Blois method [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] as described by Brand-Williams et al. [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] with some modifications. The principle of this method is based on the measurement of DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) free radical scavenging in solution in methanol according to the reaction in
