<p>Another study examined the alteration of the majority compounds of essential oils extracted from Barbary thuja leaves from Morocco during shade drying. The majority of compounds are bornyl acetate (30.6%), camphor (18.6%), 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene (16.8%), limonene (5.7%), and borneol (4.7%). The additional concentration of these five major components increased from 61.1% on the first day to 65.3% on the thirteenth day of shade drying. They also note irregular changes during the drying period. For example, 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene varies from 23.54% on the first day to 28.78% on the thirteenth day, while bornyl acetate progresses from 30.74% to 22.27% during the same period. The other components remain practically stable during the storage period [
