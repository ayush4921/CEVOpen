<p>GLs are documented as a source of natural compounds that are readily available. GL extracts have been extensively studied for their high levels of antioxidant, anticancer, hypoglycemic, and other biological activities. The rich presence of minerals and proteins, as well as vitamins, in GLs promote their utilization as a direct source of nutrients. The presence of numerous bioactive chemical compounds in GLs have been reported to enhance and stabilize different physiological and metabolic functions in the human body. GL also contains many secondary metabolites, such as flavonoids, triterpenoids, sesquiterpenes, glycosides, alkaloids, saponins, and other phenolic compounds. These compounds play a key role as immune stimulators and modulators of chronic diseases including diabetes, cancer, and gastrointestinal, neurodegenerative, and cardiovascular diseases. GL essential oil also has antioxidant, antimicrobial, and antiproliferative activity. GL extracts that contain high concentrations of vitamin E, flavone (apigenin), or Î²-caryophyllene show significant antiproliferative activity against colon carcinoma and various forms of human cancer. GL therefore has peculiar characteristics and pharmaceutical and medicinal profiles that promote diverse applications as an essential plant component in medicinal research and a low-cost ingredient in foodstuffs. Furthermore, as an ingredient of plant origin, GL may help in mitigate drug resistance, which is a major problem for the pharmaceutical industry and also can be utilized as a functional food ingredient, which are in high demand. Thus, guava extract with its multiple medicinal properties needs to be further developed for wider applicability. In future studies, the identification and isolation of new chemical components for the development of specific products will be the key research area.</p>
