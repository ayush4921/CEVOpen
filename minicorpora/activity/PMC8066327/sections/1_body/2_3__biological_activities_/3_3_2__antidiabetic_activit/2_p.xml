<p>GLs have been widely used as ethnomedicine for diabetes management [
 <xref rid="B15-foods-10-00752" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Flavonoids and polysaccharides of GLs have been reported for their antidiabetic potential in several studies. Guaijaverin and avicularin flavonoids of GL extract were associated with significant improvement in the function of β-cells of pancreatic islets and hepatocyte morphology in diabetic mice [

 <xref rid="B14-foods-10-00752" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] extracted GL polysaccharides (GLPs) and further tested the antidiabetic effects on streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice in combination with a high-fat diet. The authors revealed that GLP was associated with a significant reduction in total cholesterol, triglycerides, glycated serum protein, creatinine, fasting blood glucose, and malonaldehyde content, and increased total superoxide dismutase and total antioxidant capacity enzyme activity in vivo. Suboptimal glycemic regulation may lead to elevated postprandial glucose concentrations. Nair et al. [
 <xref rid="B60-foods-10-00752" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] suggested that the inhibitors of α-amylase and α-glucosidase enzyme can decline postprandial glucose absorption, and are therefore possible targets for diabetes management. The polysaccharides were isolated from GLs by ultrasound-assisted extraction and the antiglycation activity of extracted polysaccharides was studied [
 <xref rid="B16-foods-10-00752" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The authors found that GLP showed strong inhibition of α-glucosidase, with a 99.54% inhibition rate at a 100 μg/mL concentration, and less inhibition of α-amylase, with a 14.06% inhibition rate at a 1mg/mL dose concentration. The findings suggests that bioactive compounds from GLs can be effective in reducing the risk of diabetes.
