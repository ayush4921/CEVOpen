<p>Cancer is a complex health disorder which is identified by the development of cell proliferation or a decrease, causing apoptosis [
 <xref rid="B46-foods-10-00752" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. It can be caused by several exogenous and endogenous factors involved in the excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This can result in single- or double-strand breaks in DNA or RNA, base mutations, chromosomal breaking and reorganization, DNA cross-linkage, nucleic acid degradation, damage to cell membrane integrity due to lipid peroxidation, and tumor formation [

Terpenoids and flavonoids present in GLs exhibit antitumor effects by regulating the immune system, suppression of signal transfer and tumor cell adhesion, and an impediment to tumor angiogenesis and cell proliferation [

Studies suggest that these leaves exhibit a potent inhibitory effect against cancer cell lines like MDA-MB-231 and Michigan Cancer Foundation-7 (MCF-7) for breast cancer, Henrietta Lacks (HeLa) for cervical cancer, KB for nasopharyngeal cancer, LNCaP, DU 145, and prostate cancer-3 (PC-3) for prostate cancer, and colorectal 320 double minutes (COLO320DM) for colon cancer [
