<p>Liver lipid metabolism requires the activity of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and PPARÎ± and rats treated with guava leaf extract demonstrated enhanced activity of both parameters. In addition, the guava leaf extracts could ameliorate hepatic insulin resistance. Alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) are associated with the functioning of the liver. Increases in their levels are an indication of fatty liver, which could be restricted with the administration of guava leaf extract [

Additionally, it has been found that diabetes has a close association with malfunctioning of the liver, including liver enlargement, steatosis, and fibrosis, as the primary function of the liver is to stabilize blood glucose levels. Any abnormality in the metabolism of glucose, lipid, and insulin is seen as a classic condition in type 2 diabetes mellitus. The bioactive compounds guaijaverin and avicularin present in guava leaves are potent inhibitors of dipeptidyl-peptidase IV and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4)-mediated glucose uptake, respectively, responsible for raising the blood glucose levels [
