<p>The evolution of novel disease-causing strains and resistance of microbes to classical antibiotics are currently serious concerns. The incidence of systemic microbial infections such as septicemia, urinary tract infections, meningitis, pneumonia, and gastritis affects the entire human body and contributes significantly to global mortality. Food-borne diseases are mostly caused by pathogens including

These compounds act by the inhibition of microbial cell wall development, disruption, and lysis, hampering biofilm formation, repression of DNA replication and transcription, impeding adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, suppression of bacterial toxins, and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [
