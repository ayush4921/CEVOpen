<p>Guava leaves are the rich source of minerals, such as calcium, potassium, sulfur, sodium, iron, boron, magnesium, manganese, and vitamins C and B. The higher concentrations of Mg, Na, S, Mn, and B in GLs makes them a highly suitable choice for human nutrition and also as an animal feed to prevent micronutrient deficiency [

 <xref rid="B23-foods-10-00752" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] reported the concentration of minerals such as Ca, P, K, Fe, and Mg as 1660, 360, 1602, 13.50, and 440 mg per 100g of guava leaf dry weight (DW), respectively. The concentration of vitamins C and B was 103.0 and 14.80 mg per 100g DW, respectively. Consumption of Ca- and P-rich GLs reduces the risk of deficiency-related diseases like hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and osteoporosis. The study also reported that the concentration of Ca, P, Mg, Fe, and vitamin B in GLs was higher than that in guava fruit. The higher vitamin C content in GLs may help in improving the immune system and maintain the health of blood vessels, whereas vitamin B plays an important role in improving blood circulation, nerve relaxation, and cognitive function stimulation.
