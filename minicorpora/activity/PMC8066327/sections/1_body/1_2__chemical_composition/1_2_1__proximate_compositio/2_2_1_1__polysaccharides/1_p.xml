<p>Polysaccharides are macromolecules that are ubiquitously present in nature. They are made of long polymeric chains, which are composed of monosaccharide units. These polysaccharides demonstrate various physicochemical, biological, and pharmacological properties, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, immunomodulatory, and antitumor activities [

Guava leaf polysaccharides (GLPs) can be isolated using ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) (time: 20 min, power: 404 W, temperature: 62 °C). These GLPs contain about 9.13% uronic acid and 64.42% total sugars, out of which 2.24% are reducing sugars. GLPs are soluble in water, while insoluble in organic solvents like ethanol, diethyl ether, ethyl acetate, acetone, and chloroform. Extracted GLP with a concentration of 100 μg/mL exhibits good antioxidant capacity with 56.38% and 51.73% 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical- and 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) radical cation-scavenging capacity, respectively [

 <sup>•</sup>- and 
 <sup>•</sup>OH-scavenging activity (72–86% and 42.94–58.33%). GLPs can be categorized into two groups: unsulfated and sulfated GLPs. Sulfated GLP contains about 18.58% sulfate content. Sulfated GLP exhibited good antioxidant activity in terms of DPPH, hydroxyl, and alkyl radical-scavenging activity (0.10, 0.02, and 0.17 IC
 <sub>50</sub>, mg/mL, respectively). Studies showed that guava leaves extracts (GLE) effectively reduced the oxidative stress and toxicity caused by hydrogen peroxide in mammalian cell lines (Vero cells) [

 <xref rid="B16-foods-10-00752" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. It acts as an inhibitor of glycoside hydrolases like α-glucosidase and α-amylase and thus prevents rapid glucose release from complex carbohydrates [
 <xref rid="B19-foods-10-00752" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This activity causes some of the incompletely digested complex carbohydrates to remain in the intestine and be transported to the colon. The intestinal microflora digests these complex carbohydrate fractions, causing gastrointestinal problems like diarrhea and flatulence. A study reported that GLP inhibited α-glucosidase more efficiently than acarbose without significantly blocking the α-amylase activity [
 <xref rid="B19-foods-10-00752" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Moreover, it also caused a substantial drop in fasting blood sugar, total cholesterol, total triglycerides, glycated serum protein, creatinine, and malonaldehyde in diabetic mice without causing any major side effect [
 <xref rid="B15-foods-10-00752" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Therefore, GLP can be used as a replacement of acarbose for managing diabetes mellitus and also as an antioxidant additive in foods.
