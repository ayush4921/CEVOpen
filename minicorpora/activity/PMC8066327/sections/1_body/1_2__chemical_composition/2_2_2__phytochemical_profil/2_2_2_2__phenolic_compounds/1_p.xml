<p>GLs are widely popular as a traditional source of medicine in Asian countries due to their antihyperglycemic effect. As mentioned in the previous sections, they contain superior quality bioactive polysaccharides, proteins, lipids, essential oils, vitamins, and minerals. The various secondary metabolites present in GLs include phenolic acids, flavonoids, triterpenoids, sesquiterpenes, glycosides, alkaloids, and saponins. Phenolic compounds (PCs) serve as key bioactive compounds which provide antioxidant and hypoglycemic properties to GLs. Generally, these PCs play a major role in managing various metabolic and physiological activities in the human body. About seventy-two different phenolic compounds have been determined in GLs using high-performance liquid chromatography–diode array detector–quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry [
