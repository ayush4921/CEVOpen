0: Leptospermum petersonii (family   Myrtaceae) is often cultivated for ornamental purposes but also serves as a rich source of bioactive essential oils.
1: While several studies focused on the activities of the essential oils, this study analysed the potential of spent   L. petersonii leaves as a natural food preservative.
2: Method: We investigated the in vitro antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of crude   L. petersonii extracts against activities of the purified isolated flavonoid, 6-methyltectochrysin, which was characterized using spectroscopic methods.
3: The antioxidant assays followed ORAC, FRAP and TEAC tests.
4: The antimicrobial activities of the extract and purified flavonoid were analysed against six multi-drug resistant microbial strains in broth dilution assays.
5: Result: The results revealed that both the crude extracts and isolated 6-methyltectochrysin exhibited positive radical ion scavenging antioxidant potential, however the crude extract was about 6-fold more potent antioxidant than the purified 6-methyltectochrysin.
6: The crude extract also showed strong antimicrobial activities against   Bacillus cereus, and even more potent antimicrobial agent than the reference ampicillin antibiotic against   Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp.
7: pneumoniae.
8: A higher resistance was observed for the tested Gram-negative strains than for the Gram-positive ones.
9: 6-methyltectochrysin was generally inactive in the antimicrobial assays.
10: Conclusion: The crude methanolic extract showed significant bioactivity which validates the medicinal relevance of the plant.
11: The observed biological activities, especially against a notorious strain of   B. cereus, suggest that   L. petersonii could be a promising natural source of food preservatives.
