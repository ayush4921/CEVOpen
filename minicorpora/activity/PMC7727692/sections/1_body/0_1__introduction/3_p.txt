0: The increase in the incidences of antibiotic resistance remain a global persistent threat to human health [ 8].
1: Among the known multidrug-resistant pathogens is  Bacillus cereus, an aerobic rod-shaped Gram-positive bacterium that leads to fried rice disease syndrome in Africa and elsewhere [ 9].
2: Fried rice syndrome caused by bacterial infestation with  B. cereus has been implicated in food-borne diarrhea and may lead to severe soft tissue infection in other instances [ 9].
3: This is a phenomenal problem in regions where rice is a stable food, for example, in most underdeveloped countries.
4: The poor food preservation and hygiene habits at food preparations spaces, and especially at ready-to-eat food vending spots create thriving hotspots for pathogens including  B. cereus [ 10], which may lead to food poisoning.
5: Natural food preservatives may thus proffer manageable solutions in such regions.
