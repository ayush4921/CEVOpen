<p>Column chromatography was done using Silica gel 60 (70–230 and 230–400 mesh sizes, Merck, Johannesburg, South Africa). Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was performed using TLC plates of silica gel F254 coated on aluminum (Kieselgel 60 F
 <sub>254</sub>, Merck, Johannesburg, South Africa). Visualization on TLC was achieved under UV light or by spraying the plates with 10% H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> in ethanol (

 <sup>−1</sup>. The NMR spectra of samples were recorded on Agilent 600 MHz NMR spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) using trimethylsilane (TMS) as internal standard. Chemical shifts were recorded in ppm. Mass spectroscopic (ESI-LC/MS) analysis was done on a Bruker AmaZon Ion Trap instrument (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA, USA), with 1 mg of samples. The HPLC instrument was equipped with Dionex
 <sup>®</sup> 3000 RS pump, Dionex
 <sup>®</sup> WPS-3000RS autosampler and Dionex
 <sup>®</sup> DAD-3000RS Diode Array Detector (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Separation was effected on Waters
 <sup>®</sup> Sunfire C18 reversed phase column (3.5 μm, 4.6 × 150 mm, Waters, Milford, MA, USA) at 30 °C. Samples were injected (injection volume of 10 µL) using the autosampler at a mobile phase multi gradient ratio (A-water, B-Acetonitrile, C-0.1% formic acid) from 2% B to 98% B within 80 min at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min.
