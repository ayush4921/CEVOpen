<p>To determine the Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power (FRAP) of the samples using the method described by [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-25-05487" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Each sample (10 μL) was mixed with 300 μL FRAP reagent in a 96-well plate. Samples were added in triplicates to different wells. Control wells contained 10 μL of control per well while ascorbic acid standard wells contained 10 μL of standard per well. The samples were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, afterwards, the plates were read at a wavelength of 593 nm in a Multiskan Spektrum plate reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Ascorbic acid (AA) was used as standard. The results were expressed as μmol Ascorbic acid equivalents/100 g sample weights.
