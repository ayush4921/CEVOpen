<p>The antioxidant assays (ORAC, FRAP, and TEAC) of the purified flavonoid and methanolic crude extract were done according to previously reported protocols. In the Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity Assay (ORAC) assays, the method of Wu et al. [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-25-05487" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] was adapted with slight modifications. Reagents were freshly prepared on the day of analysis to ensure quality control. Samples were dissolved in acetone with the application of sonication where necessary. Calibration standards in the range from 5 to 25 μM were prepared from a standard 500 μM stock solution of Trolox by dilution in phosphate buffer (75 mM, pH 7.4). Fluorescence filters (excitation wavelength of 485 nm and emission wavelength of 538 nm) were employed for the assay. The Fluoroskan ascent plate reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was equipped with an incubator (working temperature of 37 °C). Fluorescein stock solution was diluted with phosphate buffer to a final concentration of 14 μM per well in a black 96-microwell plate. AAPH (25 mg/mL in phosphate buffer) was then added to each well, resulting in a final AAPH concentration of 4.8 mM in each well. Sample wells contained 12 μL of each sample, in triplicates, while standard and control wells contained 12 μL of Trolox standard and control solutions, respectively. The fluorescence from each well was recorded every 5 min for 2 h. Final ORAC values were calculated using the regression equation
