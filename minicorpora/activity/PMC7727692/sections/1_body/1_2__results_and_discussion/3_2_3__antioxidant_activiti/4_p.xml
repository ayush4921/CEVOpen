<p>The Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) assay combines both the time and levels of inhibition in a phase result calculated by the area under the curve generated in the time vs. degree of inhibition plot [

This study employed the use of AAPH as the oxidant source which produces radical ions required to mimic generation of oxidative radicals in vivo. The ORAC peroxyl radical results of the antioxidant capacities of the crude extract and purified flavonoid exhibited some degree of antioxidant capacity, though the activity was improved for the crude extract. Previous structure-activity-guided studies have indicated that the phenolic â€“OH functionalities of flavonoids influence the radical scavenging properties of flavonoids [
