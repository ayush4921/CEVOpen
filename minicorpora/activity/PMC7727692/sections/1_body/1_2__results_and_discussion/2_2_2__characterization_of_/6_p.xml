<p>The 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR data were extrapolated from the NMR spectrum (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05487-f003">Figure 3</xref>). The results and carbon assignment are presented in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05487-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The results were analysed for the presence and the relative positions of specific functional groups, e.g., the hydroxyl, the methyl and the methoxy functionalities to generate the final structural. From the NMR and mass spectroscopic analyses (as well as data from literature), the isolated flavonoid was identified as 5-hydroxy-7-methoxy-6-methylflavone or 6-methyltectochrysin.
