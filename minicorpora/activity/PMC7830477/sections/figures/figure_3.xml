 <caption>
  <p>Relative gene expression (mean fold change) of various antioxidant response genes in HaCaT cells treated for 24 h with (
   <bold>a</bold>) mastic essential oil and its major components, (
   <bold>b</bold>) myrcene and (
   <bold>c</bold>) 
   <italic>α</italic>-pinene, as compared to non-treated cells. The comparative quantification method (ΔΔct) was used for the estimation of the fold change of gene expression. 
   <italic>β</italic>-Actin was used as endogenous control to normalize samples. Representative figures of at least three experiments. Results are shown as mean ± SD. Note: * 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, ** 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, *** 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 vs. control (untreated cells).
