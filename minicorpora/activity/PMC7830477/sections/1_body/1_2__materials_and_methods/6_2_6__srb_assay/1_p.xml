<p>The viability of HaCaT cells was determined using the SRB assay as described earlier, with minor modifications [
 <xref rid="B27-antioxidants-10-00127" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-antioxidants-10-00127" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Cells were seeded in 96-well plates and treated with various concentrations of mastic oil, myrcene, or 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene (1.7–222.5, 1.6–202.5, and 1.7–217.5 μg/mL, respectively) for 24 h or 48 h. Then, cells were fixed by adding 25 μL of 50% 
 <italic>w/v</italic> cold TCA and incubating at 4 °C for 1 h. Subsequently, cells were washed five times with tap water and then stained with 50 μL of 0.4% 
 <italic>w/v</italic> SRB in 1% 
 <italic>v/v</italic> acetic acid for 30 min at RT. Following an additional step of washing with 1% 
 <italic>v/v</italic> acetic acid, the fixed and stained plates were allowed to air dry overnight, followed by solubilization of the bound dye by adding 100 μL of 10 mM Trizma base. Absorbance was measured at 570 nm using an ELISA plate reader (EnSpire Multimode Plate Reader, Perkin Elmer) and the % of cellular viability was estimated using the following formula: ((sample OD
 <sub>570</sub> − media blank OD
 <sub>570</sub>)/(mean control OD
 <sub>570</sub> − media blank OD
 <sub>570</sub>)) × 100.
