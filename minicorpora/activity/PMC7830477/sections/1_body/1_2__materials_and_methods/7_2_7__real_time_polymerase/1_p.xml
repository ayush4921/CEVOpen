<p>Primers for real-time PCR were designed using Primer Express 3.0 software (Applied Biosystems by Life Technologies, Monza, Italy). The gene-specific primers were designed for: β-actin, catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1), glutathione reductase (GSR), glutathione S-transferase pi 1 (GSTP1), heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2), NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 (NQO1), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) (

Then, 1 μg of RNA was used for cDNA synthesis using the SuperScript™ II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). For real-time PCR experiments, Platinum SYBR Green (Kapa Biosystems) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Real-time PCR reactions were performed in MicroAmp
 <sup>®</sup> Fact Optical 48-Well Reaction Plates (ThermoFisher Scientific) using the KAPA SYBR
 <sup>®</sup> FAT qPCR Kit (Kapa Biosystems) on an Applied Biosystems Step One instrument (ThermoFisher Scientific) with the following program: 2 min at 50 °C, 2 min at 90 °C, 15 s at 95 °C, and 30 s at 60 °C, with the two last steps repeated for 40 cycles. The melting curve was performed to ensure the absence of primer–dimers or by-products, while for the comparative quantification the ΔΔCt was utilized. Data were normalized to 
 <italic>β</italic>-actin and each reaction was performed in triplicate in three independent experiments.
