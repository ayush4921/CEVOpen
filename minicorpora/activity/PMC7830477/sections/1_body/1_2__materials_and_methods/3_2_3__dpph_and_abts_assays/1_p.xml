<p>The radical scavenging activity was determined using the cell free DPPH and ABTS assays as described previously, with few modifications [

 <xref rid="B28-antioxidants-10-00127" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. For DPPH, a range of concentrations (mastic oil: 0.004–45 mg/mL; myrcene: 0.004–40.5 mg/mL; 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene: 0.004–43.5 mg/mL) were prepared in DMSO. Initial stock solutions of test substances were dissolved in DMSO (1:1 
 <italic>v/v</italic>). Then, 10 μL of each sample was placed in a 96-well plate and 190 μL of a 300 μM methanolic solution of DPPH was added, while 10 μL of DMSO and 190 μL of DPPH solution were used as the negative control. The plate was then left in darkness for 30 min at room temperature (RT) and the optical density (OD) was subsequently measured at 517 nm using an ELISA plate reader (EnSpire Multimode Plate Reader, Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). All experiments were performed in triplicate. The % inhibition of the DPPH radical for each concentration was calculated with the following formula: 
 <disp-formula>% DPPH radical scavenging activity = ((OD
  <sub>control</sub> − ODs
  <sub>ample</sub>)/OD
  <sub>control</sub>)) × 100.
