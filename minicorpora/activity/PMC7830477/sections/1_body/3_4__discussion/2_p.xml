<p>In the present study, we investigated the antioxidant and cytoprotective potential of the essential oil derived from the resin of 
 <italic>Pistacia lentiscus</italic> var. 
 <italic>chia</italic> [
 <xref rid="B17-antioxidants-10-00127" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and its two major constituents, myrcene and 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene. Regarding their direct antioxidant activity, our results indicated that neither mastic oil nor its constituents exhibit considerable radical scavenging activity in the DPPH and ABTS assays, while they could not protect plasmid DNA from Fenton’s reaction-induced oxidative damage. Similar observations were reported in a study where the mutagenic and antimutagenic potential of Chios mastic oil was accessed, showing that mastic oil could not afford any protection against DNA damage induced by mitomycin C in human lymphocytes using the cytokinesis block micronucleus assay [

 <italic>α</italic>-pinene indeed shows increased antioxidant activity compared to myrcene, their potency varies from undetectable to significant, depending on the study [

 <xref rid="B36-antioxidants-10-00127" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. As far as mastic preparations are concerned, the data are currently scarce regarding the direct antioxidant properties. For instance, Triantafyllou et al. showed that CMG (containing 40–55% triterpenic acids and 20–25% polymer fraction (poly-β-myrcene)) did not exhibit direct scavenging potential against superoxide in a xanthine oxidase system, but it was able to inhibit tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α)-induced production of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and superoxide in aortic rat smooth muscle cells and to attenuate protein kinase C (PKC) activity, suggesting indirect antioxidant mechanisms [
 <xref rid="B37-antioxidants-10-00127" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In another study, it was demonstrated that CMG could efficiently inhibit the copper-induced oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in vitro [
 <xref rid="B38-antioxidants-10-00127" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], but rather than solely counteracting with the oxidized LDL (oxLDL), it was pointed out that the resin enhances cell defenses via pivotal physiological pathways, e.g., by downregulating CD36 and maintaining glutathione levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In this way, the total polar extract of the resin used in the study exerted its antiapoptotic and antioxidant roles and protected the PBMCs from oxLDL-induced oxidative stress and necrosis [
