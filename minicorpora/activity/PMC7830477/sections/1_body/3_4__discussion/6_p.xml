<p>In a different study, the gene expression profile of zebrafish fed with a mastic-oil-supplemented diet using microarray analysis revealed that mastic oil caused differential expression of interferon-response-related genes, upregulation of the immune responsive gene 1 (
 <italic>irg1</italic>), and increase of 
 <italic>mucin 5.2</italic>, which is involved in host defense against pathogens [
 <xref rid="B54-antioxidants-10-00127" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. These results further support the notion that the effects of mastic oil on gene transcriptional activation may regulate its beneficial actions. In the present study, however, whether mastic oil exerts its antioxidant effects either by acting as a pro-oxidant or by affecting the transduction of other signaling pathways that are involved in the alleviation of oxidative stress was not investigated and requires further research. The biochemical and molecular mechanisms that are related with the antioxidative action of 
 <italic>Pistacia lentiscus</italic>, as discussed here, appear to be quite diverse. As mentioned above, it is of the utmost importance to correlate the antioxidant activity reported with the chemical analyses of the terpene and phenol contents of the plant parts or the tree resin, taking into consideration the species variation, gender, and developmental stage of 
 <italic>Pistacia lentiscus</italic>.
