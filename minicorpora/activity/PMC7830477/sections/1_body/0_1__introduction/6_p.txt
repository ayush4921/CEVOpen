0: While several studies describe the health-promoting properties of either CMG or its oil, few data are currently available regarding its antioxidant capacity or its cytoprotective or regenerative effects under oxidative conditions.
1: Oxidative stress plays a leading role in the aging and pathogenesis of degenerative diseases such as atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer [ 21].
2: Antioxidants can counterbalance the damaging effects of oxidation on tissues and are characterized by their ability to inhibit the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) or their direct scavenging activity [ 22].
3: Through this process, the antioxidants turn themselves into active molecules, but they are much less harmful, preventing significant damage to cell biomolecules [ 23].
4: However, antioxidant activity also extends to numerous other cellular physiological processes, such as regulation of signal transduction and regulation of gene expression of detoxifying or antioxidant enzymes [ 24].
5: It is also interesting that antioxidants can play a role as pro-oxidants.
6: The same antioxidant molecules that remove active free radicals can cause mild oxidative stress, leading to the induction of cellular signaling to enhance antioxidant defense [ 25].
7: Mild stress can turn the level of cellular defense against oxidative stress to a higher steady state, thereby contributing to an adaptive benefit to cell survival.
8: Based on this information, the analysis of the antioxidant activity of bioactive compounds should include the study of all of these fundamental actions [ 26].
