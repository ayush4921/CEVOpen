0: Essential oils are naturally occurring mixtures of volatile, hydrophobic, colorless secondary metabolites.
1: They are synthesized by aromatic plants and they possess characteristic strong aromas.
2: They can be extracted by every plant organ, e.g., from gratia buds, flowers, leaves, stems, twigs, seeds, fruits, root, wood, and bark [ 5].
3: Essential oils are mixtures of 2060 different metabolites in various concentrations, however their quality levels and exact chemical compositions differ substantially in relation to the extraction method, the plant tissue, or even the plant cultivation conditions [ 1, 6, 7].
4: Even though essential oils consist of a variety of compounds, their biological properties are mainly attributed to only a few of their components, usually the ones that are found in the highest concentration (2070% in comparison with the rest of their components).
5: In general, an essential oils composition includes phenols, terpenoids, and flavonoids, exhibiting a wide panel of cytoprotective roles, such as antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antioxidant, and apoptotic roles [ 1, 7].
