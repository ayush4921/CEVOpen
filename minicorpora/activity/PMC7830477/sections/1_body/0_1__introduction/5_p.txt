0: CMG and mastic oil have been associated with a variety of biological functions and have been extensively studied regarding their antimicrobial, anticancer, anti-indigestion, and anti-inflammatory effects [ 15, 16, 17].
1: More particularly, mastic oil has effectively attenuated the development of  Salmonella enteritis,  Pseudomonas fragi,  Lactobacillus plantarum,  Escherichia coli,  Bacillus subtilis, and  Staphylococcus aureus [ 12, 18].
2: Additionally, its anticancer potential has been demonstrated in a variety of studies.
3: For instance, mastic oil exhibited proapoptotic and antiproliferative properties against the human leukemic cell line K562 in a time- and dose-dependent manner [ 19].
4: Accordingly, treatment with mastic essential oil resulted in higher apoptosis, lower vascularization, and downregulation of chemokine expression in an immunocompetent mouse model of Lewis lung carcinoma [ 20].
5: The anticancer activity of mastic oil was previously analyzed in colon carcinoma.
6: The oil attenuated the proliferation of a panel of colon cancer cell lines (CT26, Caco-2, HT29), while its oral administration inhibited tumor growth of colon carcinoma in a BALB/c transplantable mouse model.
7: Interestingly, its major components, myrcene and  -pinene, did not exhibit the same anticancer activity as the mastic essential oil [ 17].
