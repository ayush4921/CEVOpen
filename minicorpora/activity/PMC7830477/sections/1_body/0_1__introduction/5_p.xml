<p>CMG and mastic oil have been associated with a variety of biological functions and have been extensively studied regarding their antimicrobial, anticancer, anti-indigestion, and anti-inflammatory effects [

 <xref rid="B18-antioxidants-10-00127" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Additionally, its anticancer potential has been demonstrated in a variety of studies. For instance, mastic oil exhibited proapoptotic and antiproliferative properties against the human leukemic cell line K562 in a time- and dose-dependent manner [
 <xref rid="B19-antioxidants-10-00127" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Accordingly, treatment with mastic essential oil resulted in higher apoptosis, lower vascularization, and downregulation of chemokine expression in an immunocompetent mouse model of Lewis lung carcinoma [
 <xref rid="B20-antioxidants-10-00127" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The anticancer activity of mastic oil was previously analyzed in colon carcinoma. The oil attenuated the proliferation of a panel of colon cancer cell lines (CT26, Caco-2, HT29), while its oral administration inhibited tumor growth of colon carcinoma in a BALB/c transplantable mouse model. Interestingly, its major components, myrcene and 
 <italic>Î±</italic>-pinene, did not exhibit the same anticancer activity as the mastic essential oil [
