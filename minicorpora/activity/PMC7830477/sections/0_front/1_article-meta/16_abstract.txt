0: The antioxidant, cytoprotective, and wound-healing potential of the essential oil from the resin of   Pistacia lentiscus var.
1: chia (mastic oil) was evaluated, along with that of its major components, myrcene and   -pinene.
2: Antioxidant potential was monitored as: (i) direct antioxidant activity as assessed by 2,2-di-phenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid), and ABTS assays; (ii) DNA damage protection activity; and (iii) cytoprotective activity as assessed via induction of transcription of genes related to the antioxidant response in human keratinocyte cells (HaCaT).
3: The cytoprotective potential of the test substances was further evaluated against ultraviolet radiation B (UVB)- or H  2O  2-induced oxidative damage, whereas their regenerative capability was accessed by monitoring the wound closure rate in HaCaT.
4: astic oil and major components did not show significant direct antioxidant activity, however they increased the mRNA levels of antioxidant response genes, suggesting indirect antioxidant activity.
5: Treatment of HaCaT with the test substances before and after UVB irradiation resulted in increased cell viability in the cases of pre-treatment with mastic oil or post-treatment with myrcene.
6: Increased cytoprotection was also observed in the case of cell treatment with mastic oil or its major components prior to H  2O  2 exposure.
7: Finally, mastic oil and myrcene demonstrated a favorable dose-dependent effect for cell migration and wound closure.
8: Collectively, mastic essential oil may exert its promising cytoprotective properties through indirect antioxidant mechanisms.
