0: As we knew, there was little information available in literature about the effect of AL on UC.
1: The mechanism of action has poorly been understood.
2: Furthermore, there were no reports and literature about comparing anti-inflammatory activities of the crude and processed AL on UC.
3: Therefore, in this study, we aimed to address the effects of the crude and bran-processed AL on UC in vitro and uncover the underlying mechanism based on regulating the IKK/NF-kappa B signaling pathway.
