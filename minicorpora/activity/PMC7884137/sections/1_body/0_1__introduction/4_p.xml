<p>As we knew, there was little information available in literature about the effect of AL on UC. The mechanism of action has poorly been understood. Furthermore, there were no reports and literature about comparing anti-inflammatory activities of the crude and processed AL on UC. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to address the effects of the crude and bran-processed AL on UC in vitro and uncover the underlying mechanism based on regulating the IKK/NF-kappa B signaling pathway.</p>
