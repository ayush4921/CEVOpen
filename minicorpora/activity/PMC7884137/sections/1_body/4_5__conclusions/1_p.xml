<p>In summary, we evaluated the effects of the essential oil of AL on UC in vitro and compared the effects between the crude AL and bran-processed AL. We also explored the mechanism based on regulating the IKK/NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B signaling pathway. The results suggested the essential oil obtained from both crude AL and bran-processed AL had no toxicity itself on HCoEpiCs, but it increased the cell viability of inflammatory injury HCoEpiCs, decreased the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, and increased the level of anti-inflammatory cytokine. The bran-processed AL had more satisfactory effects in treatment of inflammatory injury of HCoEpiC induced by LPS than the crude AL. Furthermore, based on the above results, we identified the anti-inflammatory effect of AL partly by downregulating the IKK/NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B signaling pathway. Some constituents in AL changed after bran-processing. Maybe, this is why the essential oil of bran-processed AL was more effective. However, it demands further research to confirm.
