<p>The NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B pathway is treated as the critical and classical pathway and is the primary inflammatory signal transduction pathway. Many studies have already shown that overexpression of NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B is typical in inflamed colonic tissue [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>–
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Under normal circumstances, NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B is bound to the inhibitory protein I
 <italic>κ</italic>B, which is normally in its inactive state. After stimulation, I
 <italic>κ</italic>B kinase (IKK) becomes phosphorylated, resulting in the phosphorylation of I
 <italic>κ</italic>B, which dissociates from NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B and enters the nucleus to regulate the secretion and expression of inflammatory factors. The activation of IKK/NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B, which is an essential cause of severe inflammation [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], increases the secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines and induces inflammatory reactions [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].
