<p>Essential oil, mainly including sesquiterpenoids and polyacetylene, is the major active ingredient in AL [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. We analyzed the composition of essential oils both from crude AL and bran-processed AL by GC-MS. The results showed that there were 6 new components and 7 components with increasing contents in processed AL. These may be the reasons the bran-processed AL had more satisfactory effects in treatment of UC than the crude AL. However, it demands further research such as isolation and fractionation to purify these compounds in order to determine their activity individually and/or in combination.
