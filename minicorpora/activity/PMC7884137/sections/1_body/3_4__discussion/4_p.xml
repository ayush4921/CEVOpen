<p>In the present study, first, the optimal concentrations of LPS on HCoEpiC were determined, and the results demonstrated that 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL of LPS was optimal. The essential oils did not demonstrate cytotoxicity in normal HCoEpiCs but increased the cell viability after inflammatory injury induced by LPS. In general, the processed AL showed a better effect compared with the crude AL. The levels of proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, IL-1
 <italic>β</italic>, TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>, and NO were increased in the LPS group. After treatment with the essential oil from the crude and bran-processed AL, lower levels of IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, IL-1
 <italic>β</italic>, TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>, and NO were observed in a dose-dependent manner. The essential oil from the bran-processed AL showed more remarkable effectiveness than that from the crude AL. However, the level of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-4 was decreased in the LPS group. The essential oil from crude and bran-processed AL significantly increased the level of IL-4 in a dose-dependent manner. The essential oil from the bran-processed AL showed a better effect. These findings suggested that AL could decrease inflammation associated with UC, and the bran-processed AL was more effective.
