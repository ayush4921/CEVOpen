<p>After incubated with various concentrations (1, 10, and 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) of essential oils of AL and LPS (10 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) for 24, 48, and 72 h respectively, the cells were collected. The expressions of IKK-
 <italic>α</italic>, p-IKK-
 <italic>α</italic>, p-IKK-
 <italic>β</italic>, NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B, IL-6, and IL-8 proteins were determined by Western blot. The representative images are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, and the expressions of IKK-
 <italic>α</italic>, p-IKK-
 <italic>α</italic>, p-IKK-
 <italic>β</italic>, NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B, IL-6, and IL-8 proteins are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. Compared with the control group, higher levels of p-IKK-
 <italic>α</italic>, p-IKK-
 <italic>β</italic>, NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B, IL-6, and IL-8 were found in the LPS group (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). After treatment with the essential oil from AL, the levels of p-IKK-
 <italic>α</italic>, p-IKK-
 <italic>β</italic>, NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B, IL-6, and IL-8 were lower than those in the LPS group in a dose-dependent manner. But, there was no difference in the level of IKK-
 <italic>α</italic> in all the groups. In general, the processed AL showed better p-IKK-
 <italic>α</italic>, p-IKK-
 <italic>β</italic>, NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B, IL-6, and IL-8 decreasing effects compared with the crude AL.
