 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. In essential oils of crude and bran-processed AL, 29 and 31 compounds were detected, respectively. 4 compounds were not detected in bran-processed AL, but there were 6 new compounds in AL after processing. 12 chemical components, whose relative contents were more than 0.5%, were identified. They existed in both crude and bran-processed AL. After bran-processing, the relative contents of 5 compounds decreased, while other 7 compounds increased.
