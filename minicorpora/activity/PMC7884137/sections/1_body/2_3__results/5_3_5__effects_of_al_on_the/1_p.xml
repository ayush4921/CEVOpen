<p>After treatment with the essential oil from the crude and processed AL for 24, 48, and 72 h, respectively, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, IL-1
 <italic>β</italic>, TNF-
 <italic>α,</italic> and NO in the cell supernatants were detected by ELISA. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, compared with the control group, the lower level of IL-4 and higher levels of IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, IL-1
 <italic>β</italic>, TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>, and NO were found in the LPS group (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). The essential oil from the crude AL and bran-processed AL significantly increased the level of IL-4 (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 except crude AL at the concentration of 1 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL incubated for 24, 48 h) and decreased the levels of IL-6 (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 except crude AL at the concentration of 1 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL incubated for 48 h), IL-8, IL-12, IL-1
 <italic>β</italic>, TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>, and NO (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) in a dose-dependent manner. Again, the differences of bran-processed AL versus the crude AL of the same concentration were significant with a few exceptions (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). The processed AL showed more remarkable IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, IL-1
 <italic>β</italic>, TNF-
 <italic>α,</italic> and NO regulation effects than the crude AL.
