<p>Different final concentrations of LPS (5, 10, and 15 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) were added to the cells and incubated for 12, 24, 48, and 72 h, respectively. The cell viability was detected by an MTT assay. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, LPS significantly decreased the cell viability of HCoEpiCs compared with the control group (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05), only except LPS (5 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL incubated for 24 h). Again, compared with the LPS (5 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) group, the differences in LPS (10 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) group or LPS (15 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) group were significant (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) except incubated for 12 h. But, there was no difference between the LPS (10 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) group and LPS (15 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) group (
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05). So, we chose LPS (10 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) to induce inflammatory injury of HCoEpiC in this study.
