<p>In this study, we conducted the MTT assay to evaluate the cell viability effects of essential oil from the crude and bran-processed AL on the HCoEpiCs. Essential oils (0.5, 1, 10, 100, and 1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) were added to the cells and incubated for 12, 24, 48, and 72 h, respectively. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, LPS significantly decreased the cell viability of HCoEpiCs compared with the control group (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Compared with the LPS group, the essential oil, whether it was from crude or bran-processed AL, increased the cell viability with a few exceptions. In general, the bran-processed AL showed a better effect compared with the crude AL. The differences of bran-processed AL (10 and 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) versus the crude AL of the same concentration were significant (48 h, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05).
