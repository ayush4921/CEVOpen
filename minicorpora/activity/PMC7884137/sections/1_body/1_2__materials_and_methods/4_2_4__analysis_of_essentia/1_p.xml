 <italic>μ</italic>L of essential oils was transferred into a 5 mL standard flask, and n-hexane was added to the mark. Samples were analyzed on the Agilent GC-MS system (7890B-5977 A, Agilent, USA) using HP-5 phenyl methyl silox (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 
 <italic>μ</italic>m) capillary. Helium was used as carrier gas at a flow of 1 mL/min. 1 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of samples was injected in the splitless mode. The temperature program of the oven was with the initial temperature of 50°C for 3 min, raised for 10°C linearly to 290°C. Mass spectra were analyzed at 70 eV, and ion source temperature was kept at 200°C. Total ion chromatogram was created for m/
 <italic>z</italic> range 45–650. Interpretations on mass spectrum of GC-MS were performed using the database of NIST libraries (National Institute of Standards and Technology). The relative percentage amount of each component was calculated by comparing its peak area to the total area of peaks in the chromatogram.
