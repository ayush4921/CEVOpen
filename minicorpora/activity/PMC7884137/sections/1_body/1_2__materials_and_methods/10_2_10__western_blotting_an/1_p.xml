 <italic>κ</italic>B, IL-6, and IL-8 proteins were determined by Western blot. Briefly, the cells were washed with PBS and harvested. The cell harvests were lysed with RIPA lysis buffer containing 1 mmol/L PMSF. The protein concentrations were determined by the BCA method. 30 
 <italic>μ</italic>g of each protein sample was separated by 10% SDS-PAGE gel and electrotransferred onto a PVDF membrane. The incubation of membranes was performed with primary antibodies (1 : 3000), including IKK-

 <italic>α</italic>, p-IKK-

 <italic>κ</italic>B, IL-6, and IL-8, and 
 <italic>β</italic>-actin antibodies overnight at 4°C. The corresponding horseradish peroxidase- (HRP-) conjugated secondary antibodies (1 : 5000) were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were visualized by electrochemiluminescence and scanned. Data were collected from three independent sets of experiment and analyzed by densitometry using Image J software.
