<p>Essential oils were extracted by steam distillation. 1000 g rhizomes of crude AL and bran-processed AL were placed in round bottom flasks, respectively. 8000 mL water was added. Distilling flasks with the volatile oil extractor and condenser were connected. The distilling flask needed to be heated at 100°C for 8 h by a heating mantle. Finally, the essential oils were collected [
