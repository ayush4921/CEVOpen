<p>The HCoEpiCs suspensions were planted in 96-well culture plate at 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well, respectively, and cultured for 24 h. Except the control group, LPS (10 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) was added. The suspension without essential oil was used as the LPS group. Different final concentrations of essential oil obtained from the crude and bran-processed AL (0.5, 1, 10, 100, and 1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) were added and incubated for 12, 24, 48, and 72 h, respectively. The cell viabilities were measured by MTT assay. The experiment was repeated three times.
