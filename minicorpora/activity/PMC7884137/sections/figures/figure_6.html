 <caption> The mRNA expressions of IKK- α (a), NF- κB (b), IL-4 (c), IL-6 (d), IL-8 (e), and TNF- α (f) in the cell incubated for 24, 48, and 72 h were determined by quantitative RT-PCR. Fold changes of mRNA levels of target genes related to endogenous reference β-actin were calculated. Data were expressed as mean ± SD ( n = 6). ∗ P &lt; 0.05 versus the LPS group, and # P &lt; 0.05 versus the crude AL group of the same concentration. </caption>
