0: The present study examined the chemical composition and antimicrobial and gastrointestinal activity of the essential oils of   Elettaria cardamomum (L.) Maton harvested in India (EC-I) and Guatemala (EC-G).
1: Monoterpenes were present in higher concentration in EC-I (83.24%) than in EC-G (73.03%), whereas sesquiterpenes were present in a higher concentration in EC-G (18.35%) than in EC-I (9.27%).
2: Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 0.5 and 0.25 mg/mL were demonstrated against   Pseudomonas aeruginosa in EC-G and EC-I, respectively, whereas MICs of 1 and 0.5 mg/mL were demonstrated against   Escherichia coli in EC-G and EC-I, respectively.
3: The treatment with control had the highest kill-time potential, whereas the treatment with oils had shorter kill-time.
4: EC-I was observed to be more potent in the castor oil-induced diarrhea model than EC-G. At 100 and 200 mg/kg, P.O., EC-I exhibited 40% and 80% protection, respectively, and EC-G exhibited 20% and 60% protection, respectively, in mice, whereas loperamide (10 mg/kg, i.p., positive control) exhibited 100% protection.
5: In the in vitro experiments, EC-I inhibited both carbachol (CCh, 1 M) and high K  + (80 mM)-induced contractions at significantly lower concentrations than EC-G.
6: Thus, EC-I significantly inhibited   P. aeruginosa and   E. coli and exhibited more potent antidiarrheal and antispasmodic effects than EC-G.
