 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Tanvir et al. (2017)</xref> using Folin-Ciocalteu reagent. Briefly, 5% methanolic extract was prepared by adding turmeric powder (5 g) in 70% methanol solution to make a 100 mL solution. Then the solution was filtered through Whatman No. 44 filter paper. After filtration, 0.1 mL of the extract (0.5 mg/mL) was mixed with 2 mL of 7.5% sodium carbonate solution. Then, 2.5 mL of 10-fold diluted Folin-Ciocalteu reagent was added, and then distilled water was added to make the solution 10 mL. The resulting final reaction mixture was incubated for one hour in the dark. The intensity of the blue-colored complex was measured at 765 nm using a JASCO V-630 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Corporation, Japan). The TPC present was expressed as milligram of Gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/gram of extracts on a dry weight basis (DW) of plant material after plotting calibration curve for different concentrations (5–30 μg/mL) of Gallic acid.
