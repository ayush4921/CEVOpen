<p id="p0035">The methanolic extract was prepared as described by 
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Green et al. (2008)</xref>, but with slight modifications. Fifteen-gram grounded turmeric powder was put in a 1 L conical flask and aliquot of 250 mL of methanol (99%) was added, and the conical flask was covered with aluminum foil to minimize solvent loss through evaporation. The mixture was then placed on a magnetic stirrer and extracted for six hours. The extract was filtered by gravity when the extraction was completed. The residue obtained from the filtration was re-extracted with 100 mL of ethanol for two hours. Both filtrates were pooled together and concentrated in a rotary evaporator (Colen-Parmer, SB-1200) in a water bath set at 50 °C. The obtained methanol extract was quantified, and the yield was calculated as a percentage (w/w).
