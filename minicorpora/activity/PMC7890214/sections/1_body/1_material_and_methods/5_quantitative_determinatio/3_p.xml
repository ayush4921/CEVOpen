<p id="p0050">For the preparation of the sample solution from turmeric powder, the powder (100 mg) of each sample was separately transferred to a 10 mL volumetric flask. Methanol was added to volume and mixed. Then the mixture was set aside at room temperature for 24 h with frequent shaking. One mL of the clear supernatant liquid was transferred and diluted with methanol to 25 mL volume. One mL of this solution was then transferred to a 50 mL volumetric flask and diluted to volume with methanol. The absorbance of these solutions and serial standard dilutions were taken at 425 nm using UV-Visible spectrophotometry (Model: JASCO V-630, Shimadzu Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) having two matched quartz cells with 1 cm path length.</p>
