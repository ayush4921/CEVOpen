 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> shows a relationship between the concentration (μg/mL) of methanolic extracts and DPPH radical scavenging capacity. The results indicate that as the extracts' concentration increases from 16 to 130 μg/mL, the percentage of scavenging capacity rises by 77.9, 71.9, and 73.8 % for Bonga 51/71, HT3/2002, and Dame varieties, respectively. The scavenging capacity of DPPH versus concentration of extracts (μg/mL) was plotted for the determination of half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) of the DPPH-radical scavenging activity.
