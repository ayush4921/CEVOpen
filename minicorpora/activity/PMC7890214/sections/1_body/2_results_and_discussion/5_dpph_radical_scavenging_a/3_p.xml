 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> shows the calculated percentage of inhibition at 16 μ g/mL and IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of the standard and the extracts. Amongst the three turmeric varieties, Dame revealed the highest scavenging activity (46.58%) with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 23.05 μg/mL, and Bonga 51/71 variety exhibited the lowest scavenging activity (40.80%) and higher IC
 <sub>50</sub> value (44.32 μg/mL). Here, IC
 <sub>50</sub> explains the antioxidant concentration required for 50% scavenging of DPPH radicals in the specified time. The smaller IC
 <sub>50</sub> values correspond to the plant extracts' higher antioxidant activity (
