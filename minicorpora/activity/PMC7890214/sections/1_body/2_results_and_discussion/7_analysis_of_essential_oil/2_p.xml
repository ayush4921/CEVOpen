 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The most abundant components were oxygenated sesquiterpenes with α-Turmerone (32.41 and 35.16%), ar-turmerone (25.20 and 25.47%), and curlone (β-turmerone) (17.98 and 18.19%) (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>) followed by sesquiterpenes with α-Curcumene (4.20 and 3.74%), α-Zingiberene (4.96 and 4.53%), and β-Sesquiphellandrene (5.51 and 4.85%) for Dame and Bonga 51/71 varieties, respectively (

 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Gounder and Lingamallu (2012)</xref> that sesquiterpenoid (i.e., ar-turmerone [28.3%], α-turmerone [24.8%] and curlone [21.1%]) were the major constituents, whereas α-phellandrene (1.2%), α-zingiberene (2.4%), β-sesquiphellandrene (2.1%), ar-curcumene (1.8%) and eucalyptol (0.4%) were the minor constituents of turmeric rhizomes.
