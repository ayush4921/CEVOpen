<p id="p0140">The varying sensitivity degree of turmeric extracts against bacterial strains might be due to the difference in the cell wall structure of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. It was described by 
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Chouhan et al. (2017)</xref> that, Gram-negative bacteria such as 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S. typhimurium</italic>, exhibit rigid lipopolysaccharide on an outer membrane, thereby limiting the diffusion of hydrophobic compounds through it. On the other hand, a thick peptidoglycan wall is not dense enough to resist small antimicrobial molecules, facilitating access to the Gram-positive bacteria's cell membrane. Besides, as 
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Kwiatkowski et al. (2020)</xref> mentioned, Gram-positive bacteria may ease the infiltration of hydrophobic compounds of EOs due to the lipophilic ends of lipoteichoic acid present in the cell membrane. These compounds impart crucial processes in the cell due to the increased membrane permeability, consequently inducing leakage of ions and important cell contents, that eventually leads to cell death.
