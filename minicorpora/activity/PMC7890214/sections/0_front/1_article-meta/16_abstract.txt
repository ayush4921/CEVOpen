0: Turmeric is a known spice indispensable for food preparation and is reported to possess different chemical properties and biological activities.
1: The objective of this study was to determine the effects of variety and type of extracts on 1, 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) reducing capacity, antibacterial activity, and chemical composition of essential oil from turmeric varieties cultivated in Ethiopia.
2: The results from the statistical analysis revealed that the highest total curcuminoids content (6.81% m/m), essential oil (6.37% v/m), methanol extract (13.42% v/m) were obtained from Dame variety.
3: On the other hand, the lowest curcuminoids (5.12% m/m), methanol extract (10.58% v/m) and essential oil (3.92% v/m) contents were obtained from HT3/2002 variety.
4: Dame variety also had the highest total polyphenol content (97.55 mg GAE/g) and radical scavenging capacity (46.58 16 g/mL) with the lowest IC  50 value (23.05 g/mL).
5: Among the tested microorganisms with turmeric extracts, growth inhibition was observed against   S. aureus.
6: The results also indicated that three compounds, namely -Turmerone (32.41 and 35.16%), ar-Turmerone (25.20 and 25.47%), and Curlone (17.98 and 18.19%) dominated 75% of the essential oil component in Dame and Bonga 51/71 varieties, respectively.
7: In summary, the results of this study revealed that extracts from Dame variety have strong biological potential with desired antioxidant and antibacterial activities.
