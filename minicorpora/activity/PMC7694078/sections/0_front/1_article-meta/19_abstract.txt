0: Manuka oil is an essential oil derived from   Leptospermum scoparium, a plant that has been used by the indigenous populations of New Zealand and Australia for centuries.
1: Both the extracted oil and its individual components have been associated with various medicinal properties.
2: Given the rise in resistance to conventional antibiotics, natural products have been targeted for the development of antimicrobials with novel mechanism of action.
3: This review aimed to collate available evidence on the antimicrobial, anti-parasitic and anti-inflammatory activities of manuka oil and its components.
4: A comprehensive literature search of was conducted using PubMed and Embase (via Scopus) targeting articles from database inception until June 2020.
5: Chemical structures and IUPAC names were sourced from PubChem.
6: Unpublished information from grey literature databases, Google search, targeted websites and Google Patents were also included.
7: The present review found extensive in vitro data supporting the antimicrobial effects of manuka oil warrants further clinical studies to establish its therapeutic potential.
8: Clinical evidence on its efficacy, safety and dosing guidelines are necessary for its implementation for medical purposes.
9: Further work on regulation, standardization and characterization of the medicinal properties of manuka oil is required for establishing consistent efficacy of the product.
