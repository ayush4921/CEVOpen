<p>Mānuka (
 <italic>Leptospermum scoparium</italic>), also known as kahikatoa, red mānuka and tea tree, belongs to the 
 <italic>Myrtaceae</italic> plant family and is found throughout New Zealand and Australia [
 <xref rid="B1-pharmaceuticals-13-00343" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Commonly grouped under ‘tea trees,’ which also includes 
 <italic>Camellia sinensis, Kunzea ericoides</italic>, 
 <italic>Leptospermum petersonii</italic> and 
 <italic>Melaleuca alternifolia</italic>, these species have been used by the Māori, the Aboriginals and early European settlers as topical preparations for wounds, cuts, sores and skin diseases and as inhalations for colds and fevers. Interest in the medicinal properties of mānuka, particularly mānuka honey, has grown over the last 30 years. There is also a growing interest in the volatile oil due to its potential application as a medicinal agent or cosmetic ingredient [

Currently, there has not been a critical review on the efficacy and potential applications of mānuka oil while there have been extensive reviews on Mānuka honey and its medical applications. We aim to bridge this gap through this review, providing an up-to-date summary of recent developments in our understanding of the medicinal activities of mānuka oil as well as its clinical efficacy—and toxicity profile.
