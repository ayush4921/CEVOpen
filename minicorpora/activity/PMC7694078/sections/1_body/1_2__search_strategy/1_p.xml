<p>Literature search was conducted using PubMed and Embase (via Scopus) targeting articles from database inception until June 2020. Key terms like ‘
 <italic>Leptospermum scoparium</italic>’ and ‘antimicrobial’ or ‘antibacterial’ or ‘anti-inflammatory’ or ‘antiviral’ were tailored for individual databases to perform the search (a full search strategy is summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-pharmaceuticals-13-00343">Appendix A</xref>). The retrieved articles were filtered manually to exclude duplicates and then screened using titles, abstracts and full-text articles based on our objectives. Also, bibliographies of included studies were reviewed to check for articles missed during the main search. Chemical structures and IUPAC names were obtained from PubChem. Information was also gathered from grey literature databases, Google search, targeted websites and Google Patents.
