<p>The antibacterial activity of mānuka oil is relatively more pronounced against Gram positive bacteria than Gram negative bacteria (
 <xref rid="pharmaceuticals-13-00343-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The exact mechanism of the antibacterial effects in Gram positive bacteria are unknown but cell lysis of Gram-positive cells suggests disruption of the bacterial cell membrane is an important component of the mechanism. Treatment with 1.5% (
 <italic>v/v</italic>) of mānuka oil for 4 h induced morphological changes and cell lysis in methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA), while treatment with a high dose (3% 
 <italic>v/v</italic>) completely disrupted the cells [
 <xref rid="B35-pharmaceuticals-13-00343" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The β-triketone content are suggested to be responsible for this activity [
 <xref rid="B30-pharmaceuticals-13-00343" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In contrast treatment with mānuka oil against Gram negative bacteria, such as 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, caused mild alterations in morphology at low doses and higher concentrations (6% 
 <italic>v/v</italic>) were required for antibacterial effects [

 <xref rid="B35-pharmaceuticals-13-00343" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The basis of the difference is unknown but this may be due to limited diffusion across the lipopolysaccharide-based capsule covering the outer membrane of Gram negative bacteria [
