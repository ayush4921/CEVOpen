<p>A large number of studies have examined the constituents of mānuka oil, which vary depending on the source of the oil [

 <xref rid="B11-pharmaceuticals-13-00343" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Overall, 100 components were identified from 16 commercial samples of mānuka oil, of which 51 components made up 95% of the content [
 <xref rid="B7-pharmaceuticals-13-00343" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The major components of commercially available mānuka oils are reported to be leptospermone (0.8–19.4%), calamenene (2.5–18.5%), δ-cadinene (0.9–6.9%), cadina-1,4-diene (0.1–5.9%), flavesone (0.7–5.8%), cadina-3,5-diene (3.0–10.0%), α-copaene (4.3–6.5%) and α-selinene (1.3–5.0%) (
