<p>Variation of the components in mānuka oil was found both between and within natural populations of 
 <italic>L. scoparium</italic> [

 <xref rid="B16-pharmaceuticals-13-00343" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Higher levels of triketones (known to have strong antibacterial properties) were predominant in samples from the East Cape population. Higher levels of the monoterpenes, α- and β-pinene, were present in the Northland populations [
 <xref rid="B16-pharmaceuticals-13-00343" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Samples from 
 <italic>L. scoparium</italic> grown in Australia had higher monoterpene levels and almost no triketones compared to those from New Zealand [
 <xref rid="B16-pharmaceuticals-13-00343" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Mānuka oil from New Zealand was shown to have low concentrations of monoterpenes in comparison to kanuka oil (75% α-pinene) and negligible amounts of terpinen-4-ol and 1,8-cineole predominant in Australian tea tree oil [
 <xref rid="B7-pharmaceuticals-13-00343" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In general, mānuka oils from different geographic locations around New Zealand can be simplified into 3 basic chemo-type groups based on the ratio of the monoterpenes:sesquiterpenes:ß-triketones [
 <xref rid="B29-pharmaceuticals-13-00343" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. These include triketone-rich in the East Cape (marketed as Manex™), monoterpene-, linalool- and eudesmol-rch in Nelson (Kaiteriteri™) and monoterpene- and pinene rich in Canterbury [

 <xref rid="B31-pharmaceuticals-13-00343" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The age of the plant also plays a role in the nature of the essential oil, with higher sesquiterpene content in young plants and a mixed amount of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes in mature ones [
