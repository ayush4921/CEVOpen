<p>Mānuka oil, like other essential oils, has been classified as safe and tolerable for human use (CAS (US and EU) 223749-44-8; CTFA monograph ID 10572 and EINECS 425-630-7). However, the lack of clinical trials means there is limited data to inform dosing practices and toxicology profiles. The in vitro toxicity of mānuka oil and its main constituent, leptospermone, tended to vary with cell lines, concentrations tested and method of analysis (
 <xref rid="pharmaceuticals-13-00343-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). Higher cytotoxicity was observed on treatment with mānuka oil in comparison to leptospermone alone. This suggests additional components of mānuka oil that makes it more toxic to cell lines. A study of mānuka oil in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) found treatment with a concentration of 0.2% of mānuka oil reduced cell viability by ~30% [
