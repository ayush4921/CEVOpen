<p>Mﾄ］uka oil exhibits strong bacteriostatic effects against different strains of 
 <italic>Staphylococcus</italic>, including antibiotic-resistant strains (
 <xref rid="pharmaceuticals-13-00343-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Treatment with 2% (
 <italic>v/v</italic>) mﾄ］uka oil, kanuka oil or triketones in Tween 80 had limited bactericidal effects at 240 min post-treatment (using death a kinetics assay) [
 <xref rid="B30-pharmaceuticals-13-00343" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Mﾄ］uka oil has also exhibited strong activity against different strains of 
 <italic>Staphylococcus pseudintermedius,</italic> often contributory to skin and ear infections in dogs [
 <xref rid="B39-pharmaceuticals-13-00343" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. These included methicillin-resistant strains, with MICs being around 2% (
 <italic>v/v</italic>) for both resistant- and antibiotic-sensitive isolates [
 <xref rid="B39-pharmaceuticals-13-00343" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Inhibition of 
 <italic>S. pseudintermedius</italic> biofilm formation was also reported in the same study [
 <xref rid="B39-pharmaceuticals-13-00343" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Exposure of various strains of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> to subinhibitory concentrations of mﾄ］uka oil has also been found to significantly inhibit their ability to produce enterotoxins, an effect not observed after treatment with oregano and marjoram essential oils [
