<p>The effect of mānuka oil on a poultry beetle (
 <italic>Tenebrio molitor),</italic> a beneficial insect in a poultry system, was assessed along with a non-target organism. In this case, the mānuka oil had no significant effect on beetle mortality compared to the control (~15% vs. ~5%, respectively) [

 <italic>T. molitor</italic> exposure to mānuka oil were observed in another study [
 <xref rid="B59-pharmaceuticals-13-00343" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. In contrast, exposure of brine shrimp (
 <italic>Artemia salina</italic>, an organism commonly used in toxicity testing) to mānuka oil revealed a 90% mortality rate after exposure to ~0.05 mg/cm

 <sub>50</sub> for 
 <italic>D. gallinae</italic> [
 <xref rid="B59-pharmaceuticals-13-00343" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], indicating potential use of mānuka oil as a general acaricide may need careful consideration regarding the effect on non-target organisms.
