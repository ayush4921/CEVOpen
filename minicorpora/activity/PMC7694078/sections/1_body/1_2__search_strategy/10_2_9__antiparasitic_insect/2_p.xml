<p>A study of the effect of mānuka oil on different life stages of 
 <italic>D. gallinae</italic> suggests it is effective against both adult and juvenile mites but that it is not ovicidal for this parasite [

 <italic>D. gallinae</italic> found the lethal concentration required to kill 50% of the parasites (LC
 <sub>50</sub>) during a 24-h period in a contact bioassay was ~0.05 mg/cm

 <italic>D. gallinae</italic> mites for up to 4 days after treatment of the mites contained in the Y-tube of an olfactometer and exposed to either fresh air in one arm of the Y-tube or air containing the volatile components of each essential oil in the other arm [
