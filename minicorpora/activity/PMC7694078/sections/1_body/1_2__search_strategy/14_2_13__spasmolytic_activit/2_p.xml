<p>Mānuka oil and its components were also reported to increase muscle tone in skeletal muscle, evaluating its absorption in chick biventer muscle and rat phrenic nerve diaphragm preparations [

 <italic>Melaleuca</italic> oil decreased uterine muscle contractions. Application of either oils showed a decrease in tension (via inhibition of twitch response on stimulating the skeletal muscle nerve) and a weighty increase in resting tone (indicating contracture) when the muscle was stimulated either directly or via the phrenic nerve. the components α-terpineol, α-terpinene and terpinene-4-ol showing a similar, significant decrease in the force of contractions [

The study suggests the use of these oils for aromatherapy, where they would aid as relaxants for those suffering from stress and anxiety. While these studies involved relatively high doses of a limited number of mānuka oil samples, whose origins and chemotypes were not well characterized, to isolated tissues in vitro [
