<p>Smooth muscle spasmolytic activity has been reported for mānuka oil in experiments on guinea pig ileum showing a dose-dependent inhibitory effect of mānuka oil on smooth muscle contractions [
 <xref rid="B71-pharmaceuticals-13-00343" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. A subsequent study of the components of mānuka oil showed α-terpineol and terpinene-4-ol both produce strong spasmolytic activity in guinea pig ileum, while in contrast, α- and γ-terpinenes displayed spasmolytic activity after an initial spasmogenic action [
 <xref rid="B28-pharmaceuticals-13-00343" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. A post-synaptic mechanism affecting cAMP to alter potassium channels in the muscle was suggested by the authors as the possible mode of action [
 <xref rid="B28-pharmaceuticals-13-00343" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. This activity was absent in kanuka oil and neither mānuka or kanuka oil used cGMP nor behave like potassium channel openers (seen in 
 <italic>Melaleuca</italic> (tea tree) oil).
