0: BackgroundEchinops kebericho is an endemic medicinal plant in Ethiopia widely used in the treatment of infectious and noninfectious diseases.
1: Essential oils are known for their antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, insecticidal, and antioxidant properties.
2: This study evaluated the antifungal activity of essential oil from    E. kebericho against four common pathogenic fungi and two standard strains.
3: Methods The essential oil was obtained by hydrodistillation.
4: The antifungal screening was done by agar well diffusion method.
5: Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by broth microdilution.
6: Minimal fungicidal concentrations (MFCs) were determined by subculturing fungal strains with no visible growth onto a Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) plate.
7: ResultsCandida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans were highly sensitive while    Aspergillus flavus did not show sensitivity up to 1 mg/ml of essential oil; MICs ranged from 0.083 mg/ml to 0.208 mg/ml.
8: Concentration and fungal species showed significant dose-dependent associations (   p< 0.0001) with antifungal activity.
9: The MICs of essential oil were comparable to those of the standard drug (fluconazole) against    C. glabrata and    C. krusei.
10: The lowest MFC of the essential oil was observed against    Candida parapsilosis (0.145 mg/ml) while the highest MFC was against    Candida krusei (0.667 mg/ml).
11: ConclusionEchinops kebericho essential oil showed noteworthy antifungal activity against    Cryptococcus neoformans, Candida albicans, and    Candida glabrata and could be a potential candidate for further antifungal drug development.
