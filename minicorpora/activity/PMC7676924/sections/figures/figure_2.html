 <caption> Linear regression showing the relationship between concentration and the zone of inhibition of essential oil for each strain. The straight line shows the line of best fit. The slope was significantly nonzero for all the strains, except C. albicans ( p = 0.0091 for C. krusei; p = 0.0193 for C. glabrata; p = 0.0075 for C. parapsilosis; p = 0.0117 for C. neoformans; and p = 0.0626 for C. albicans). The R 2 for C. krusei was 0.6452, for C. glabrata was 0.5660, for C. parapsilosis was 0.6633, for C. neoformans was 0.6210, and for C. albicans was 0.4115. Values shown are means ± SD; n = 3 replicates. </caption>
