<p>In the current study, the essential oil of 
 <italic>E. kebericho</italic> showed noteworthy activity against 
 <italic>C. neoformans</italic> and 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>. The activity was dose-dependent and fungicidal against 
 <italic>C. glabrata,</italic> C
 <italic>. neoforman</italic>s, 
 <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic>, and 
 <italic>C. krusei</italic>. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the effectiveness of the essential oil 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, elaborate the mechanism of action, and isolate and identify the most active component(s). The activity of the combination of the essential oil with conventional antifungal drugs should also be investigated.
