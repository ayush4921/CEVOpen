<p>The present study investigated the antifungal activity of the essential oil of 
 <italic>E. kebericho</italic> on highly pathogenic invasive fungal strains, 
 <italic>C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. neoformans</italic>, and 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> and quality control strains 
 <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic> and 
 <italic>C. krusei</italic>. The study demonstrated noteworthy antifungal activity of the essential oil of 
 <italic>E. kebericho</italic> against the fungal strains: 
 <italic>C. neoformans</italic> was highly sensitive to the essential oil of 
 <italic>E. kebericho</italic>, followed by 
 <italic>C. albicans,</italic> while 
 <italic>C. glabrata</italic> was moderately sensitive. 
 <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic>, however, was not sensitive at all the tested concentrations. The zone of inhibition diameter decreased as the concentration of the essential oil decreased, showing a dose-dependent effect. The dose-dependent effect was similar to a previous study conducted with peppermint oil against fungal strains [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Fungicidal effects were observed against 
 <italic>C. glabrata, C. neoformans, C. krusei</italic> ATCC 6258, and 
 <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic> ATCC 22019.
