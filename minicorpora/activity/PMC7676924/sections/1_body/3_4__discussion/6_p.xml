<p>Two basic methods for the assessment of antimicrobial activities of essential oils are commonly used: the agar diffusion method (paper disc or well) and the broth dilution method. Although the use of microdilution in determining the activity of essential oil is the best way, agar diffusion could be utilized as a screening method, or in combination with a microdilution assay [

Most of the antimicrobial molecules in plant extracts are significantly nonpolar and do not diffuse well in the aqueous agar matrix used in agar diffusion. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) method remains the preferred one in the determination of the antimicrobial activity of plant extracts [
