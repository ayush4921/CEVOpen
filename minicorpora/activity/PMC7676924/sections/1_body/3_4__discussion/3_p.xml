<p>The activity of 
 <italic>E. kebericho</italic> essential oil against the fungal strains studied varied with the fungal strain: better activity was observed against 
 <italic>C. neoformans</italic> than the other strains. In a previous study, the essential oil of 
 <italic>Lavandula viridis</italic> L. and Zingiberaceae species (
 <italic>Z. officinale and Z. cassumunar</italic>) showed noteworthy activity against 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>neoformans.</italic> For 
 <italic>C. krusei</italic> [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], a comparable result was also observed with the essential oil of 
 <italic>Cinnamomum zeylanicum</italic> Blume [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Higher MIC was observed for 
 <italic>C. krusei</italic> on control (fluconazole) and available antifungals [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. A relatively higher MIC was also seen with 
 <italic>C. glabrata,</italic> although it was less than that seen with 
 <italic>C. Krusei</italic>. This was in agreement with a study conducted with the essential oil of 
 <italic>Artemisia sieberi</italic> and 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. 
 <italic>Candida krusei</italic> is a multidrug-resistant fungal pathogen showing resistance with amphotericin B or fluconazole [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. A study conducted on the essential oil of Thyme, 
 <italic>Summer savory</italic>, and Clove against 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic>, however, showed good antifungal activity against 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. This difference could be due to differences in the chemical constituents of essential oil between the plants, geographical variations, and/or genetic differences of the isolates used in the study [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].
