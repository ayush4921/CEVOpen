0: Antifungal treatment options are highly limited, as there are few chemical classes represented by existing antifungal drugs [ 4].
1: To date, there are three different classes of antifungal agents, polyenes, azoles, and echinocandins [ 8].
2: Drug toxicity is the major limitation of polyenes and the older generation of azole antifungal agents.
3: New antifungal agents (e.g., echinocandins and second-generation triazoles) in the past decade have transformed the management of invasive mycoses.
4: These newer antifungal agents have also important limitations such as in pharmacokinetics, drug-drug interactions, and unusual toxicities associated with long-term use [ 9].
