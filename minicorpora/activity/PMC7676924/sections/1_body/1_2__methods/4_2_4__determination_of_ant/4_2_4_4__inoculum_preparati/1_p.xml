<p>The inoculum was prepared according to CLSI guidelines [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]: 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, 
 <italic>C. glabrata</italic>, 
 <italic>C. neoformans</italic>, 
 <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic> ATCC 22019, and 
 <italic>C. krusei</italic> ATCC 6258 were subcultured on SDA media, while 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> was subcultured on PDA media. The inoculum was prepared from 24-hour-old colonies of 
 <italic>Candida</italic> species. Approximately 1 mm diameter was suspended in 5 ml of saline and adjusted to 0.5 McFarland Standard. For 
 <italic>Cryptococcus,</italic> the 72-hour-old colonies were suspended in 5 ml of saline and adjusted to 0.5 McFarland standards. The prepared suspension was vortexed for 15 minutes and the cell density was adjusted to 0.5 McFarland standards. This suspension was mixed for 15 seconds with a vortex, diluted to 1 : 50, and further diluted to 1 : 20 with RPMI medium to obtain the twofold test inoculum. The (twofold) inoculum was diluted when the wells were inoculated [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. For 
 <italic>A. flavus,</italic> the spores were harvested from 7-day-old cultures on PDA. The saline was poured into the PDA slant and mixed with a sterile swab. After 10 minutes of sedimentation, the suspension was transferred to a sterile test tube and adjusted to the 0.5 McFarland standards. This suspension was further diluted to 1 : 50 (100 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of 0.5 McFarland Standard was added to 4.9 ml RPMI media); 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of the diluted was then added to the well [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The minimal fungicidal concentrations (MFCs) were determined by subculturing fungal isolates from the wells with no visible growth onto SDA plates. The inoculated plates were incubated for 3 days at 35°C. MFC was the lowest concentration of drug that yielded a negative subculture [
