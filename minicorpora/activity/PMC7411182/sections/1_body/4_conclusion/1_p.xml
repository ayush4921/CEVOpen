<p>In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that diet inclusion of oregano and garlic essential oils can improve growth performance in broiler chickens and reduce 
 <italic>Eimeria</italic> oocyst output by exerting a coccidiostatic effect, supported by 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> tests using 
 <italic>E. tenella</italic>. Oregano and garlic essential oils exerted positive effects on the intestinal microbiota, supporting interactions between diet-mediated alterations in the microbiota and chicken growth and performance. Although it is difficult to extrapolate 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> results to 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, the present study shows that 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> inhibition of parasite invasion correlates well with 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> findings. This study provides credible evidence that the hypothesis of rearing broilers without anticoccidial drugs or ionophores is possible. More extensive large scale studies and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> challenge trials are required to confirm this possibility.
