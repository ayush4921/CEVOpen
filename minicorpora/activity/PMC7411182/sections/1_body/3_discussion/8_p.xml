<p>The broiler chickens tested here were not exposed to experimental 
 <italic>Eimeria</italic> infection. Instead, they were reared in a commercial setting where natural exposure was likely. During screening, 
 <italic>Eimeria</italic> infection was detected, diagnosed at 
 <italic>E. acervulina</italic> based on gross intestinal pathology (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>) and oocyst morphology (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Consideration of oocyst excretion indicated that parasite invasion and/or replication was reduced by the essential oil supplementation given that all other factors were identical (housing, stocking density, season, management).
