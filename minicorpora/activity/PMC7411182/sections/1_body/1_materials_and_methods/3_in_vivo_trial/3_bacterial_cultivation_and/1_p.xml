<p>From each chicken, 1 g of intestinal content was homogenized with 9 ml of sterile peptone water solution 0.1%. For bacterial enumeration, Miles and Misra Plate Method (surface drop) was used, and each sample was diluted serially via 12-fold dilutions (from 10
 <sup>−1</sup> to 10
 <sup>−12</sup>) using standard 96-well plates for microdilutions. Then 10 μl of each dilution was inoculated on media and incubated at 37°C for 48 h (

 <italic>E. coli</italic>. All plates were incubated aerobically at 37°C for 24–48 h. De Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe (MRS) agar (Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK) and TSC agar (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) were used for the isolation and enumeration of 
 <italic>Lactobacilli</italic> and 
 <italic>Clostridium perfringens</italic>, while media were incubated at 30°C for 48 h and at 37°C for 24–48 h in anaerobic conditions, respectively. Total aerobic and anaerobic counts were determined using standard plate count agar medium (Oxoid) while plates were incubated at 30°C aerobically for 24–48 h and at 37°C anaerobically for 48–72 h, respectively. For the detection and enumeration of 
 <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>, Violet Red Bile Glycose (VRBG) agar was used and plates were incubated at 37°C aerobically for 24–48 h. For bacterial count, typical colonies from an appropriate dilution were counted and counts were expressed as CFU × log per 1 g wet weight sample. Typical colonies grown on media were then described and subcultured. Typical colonies from each medium were counted and colony-forming units per gram (CFU/g) of jejunum and cecal contents were calculated based on the given dilution. Typical colonies were selected for pure cultivation and confirmed into species level by VITEK 2 system (bioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) (
