<p>The basic study design was RCB (random complete block design) and the replication (pen) was considered as the experimental unit. Experimental data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA (general linear model) function of the SPSS statistical package (version 20.0) (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Microbiology data were log-transformed (log10) before analysis. Data homogeneity was tested using Levene's test. Significance level was set at 5% (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05). Values of 
 <italic>p</italic> between 5 and 10% (0.05 &lt; 
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.10) were reported as trends.
