<p>The normalization of intracellular parasite numbers in each group with DMSO control was also assessed to dismiss a potential effect caused by the solvent. Proportions of relative inhibition of sporozoites are shown in 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> and agree with the previous analysis. Pre-treatment with oregano essential oil at 100 μg/ml after 24 HPI presented the highest inhibition among all treatments, reducing the number of intracellular parasites by ~93%. The maximum inhibition following pre-treatment with garlic essential oil was 70% after 24 HPI when using 50 μg/ml.
