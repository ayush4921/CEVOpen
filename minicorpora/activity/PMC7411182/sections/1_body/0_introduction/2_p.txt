0: Among the most important areas of performance improvement for broiler chickens has been the advance in the use of feed additives with beneficial bioactive compounds that can protect against bacteria and parasites.
1: One potential source of bioactive compounds that could be used as a natural growth enhancer with potent anticoccidial properties is oregano ( Origanum vulgare subsp.
2: hirtum), an aromatic-medicinal plant grown in Mediterranean countries ( 5,  6).
3: Oregano and its main bioactive compounds have been shown to have positive antioxidant effects, a significant impact on intestinal microbiota and intestinal cell functionality ( 7 9).
4: However,  in vitro studies with oregano have been limited, primarily examining its antibacterial and antioxidant effects by conventional or spray drying microencapsulation techniques, without fully quantifying its anticoccidial properties ( 10 14).
5: Nowadays, oregano may serve as a principal functional ingredient both in the food and feed industries, as well as in veterinary medicine ( 15,  16).
