<p>The analyses were performed on a 5973 Hewlett Packard GC system, with a split–splitless injection system and an MS detector (Hewlett Packard) operated in the electron ionization (EI) mode (70 eV), as already described elsewhere (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Casiraghi et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, the GC was equipped with a capillary column Rxi-5ms (30 m × 0.25 mm, i.d. 0.25 mm, Restek). The GC/MS conditions were as follows: helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.2 ml/min, splitless mode (0.25 min); injector temperature 280°C; interface transfer line 300°C; ion source 230°C; and oven temperature program: initial 70°C, 40°C/min up to 180°C, then 10°C/min up to 300°C (6.25 min). The total analysis time was 21 min. The MS detector was operated in selected ion monitoring (SIM) acquiring characteristic ions in prefixed temporal windows each corresponding to a peculiar cannabinoid: IS methyl oleate at 8.5 min (264 m/z); CBD-2TMS at 9.7 min (390 m/z); THC-1TMS at 10.7 min (386 m/z); CBN-1TMS at 11.4 min (367 m/z); CBDA-3TMS at 11.7 min (491 m/z); and THCA-2TMS at 12.9 min (487 m/z)
 <italic>.</italic> Throughout this article, the concentrations of phytocannabinoids were expressed as percentage weight per weight (% w/w, weight of cannabinoid/weight of oil preparation).
