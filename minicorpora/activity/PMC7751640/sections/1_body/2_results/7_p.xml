<p>The distribution of phytocannabinoids among varieties (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) was further investigated. The detailed samples list separated by varieties and processing methods can be found in the 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s9">Supplementary Tables S1–S4</xref>. Bedrocan displayed the highest content of total THC (mean ± SD, 1.47 ± 0.47), followed by FM2 (0.54 ± 0.12) and Bediol (0.45 ± 0.26), whereas Bedrolite, as expected, showed very low amounts of this cannabinoid (0.01 ± 0.09). The situation was the opposite when considering total CBD, in which the highest content was found in FM2 (0.89 ± 0.30), followed by Bediol (0.70 ± 0.45) and Bedrolite (0.66 ± 0.35). Bedrocan displayed, as expected, a slight concentration of CBD (0.04 ± 0.31).
