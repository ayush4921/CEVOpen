<p>Samples were also analyzed taking into consideration the efficiency of extraction of total THC and CBD depending on varieties and the preparation method (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s9">Supplementary Table S6</xref>). Among all samples analyzed, a reduced number of results showed coherence among the preparation method and declared content of cannabinoids. As result, the extraction efficiency (EE%) ranges (minâ€“max) were from 57.6 to 86.3 for THC and from 57.1 to 92.8% for CBD. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> and 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> illustrate the concentration of cannabinoids within main cannabis oil varieties (columns) processed with the most common methods (rows). Being confirmed that the total extracted content of THC and CBD is not significantly different with respect to the extraction method, it is interesting to note that, on the contrary, the relative content of the acidic or neutral form is strictly related to preparation method condition. Samples prepared according to Methods C and D showed a high level of neutral active THC form, whereas methods A and B results were in favor of THCA. The relative content of the two forms is essential for the expected pharmacological effect.
