<p>The same conclusion can be found in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>, which shows a heatmap coupled to hierarchical clustering, in which the cannabinoids profile is graphed against plant varieties and extraction protocol. The map is color coded to three concentration levels (blue = low, gray = middle, and red = high range). Hierarchical clustering is a frequently used method to identify similarities or differences between each individual. We noted the presence of two different and well-divided clusters, represented as dendrogram: one including Bedrocan variety and the second one included other varieties. The latter consisted of two other clusters: Bedrolite and Bediol + FM2. In respect to other varieties, Bedrocan displayed a lower concentration of CBD (tot, neutral, and acid) along with a higher concentration of THCA and CBN, whereas Bedrolite presented a weaker concentration of THC (total and neutral). As clearly demonstrated (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">7</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s9">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>), the formation of subgroups within the data set can only be done based on the variety of cannabis inflorescence and not by the extraction methods. PCA is not always able to properly separate the variations produced by each factor, and the results can be somehow problematic to read. In order to avoid this scenario, univariate and supervised statistical tests were also performed. The use of a more conservative method (ANOVA, 
 <italic>post hoc</italic> Fisherâ€™s LSD) demonstrated that all the considered cannabinoids should be capable (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) of discriminating against groups. THC, which showed a VIP score of 1.71 and a 
 <italic>p</italic> value &lt;0.05, was therefore proposed as the best phytocannabinoid able to discriminate between cannabis oils extracted by different methods and coming from different varieties (
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s9">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). However, as mentioned above, the most substantial variations should be attributed to the different cannabis varieties rather than to their extraction protocols. Further considering the extraction method results, different amplitudes of variability can be observed: higher values were reported in Methods A and B with respect to Methods C and D. The more strictly standardized preparation protocols of the latest are therefore useful.
