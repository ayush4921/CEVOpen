 <caption> Extraction efficiency (EE%) of THC ( up) and CBD ( down) measured in cannabis oil samples (4,774) obtained using different cannabis varieties and preparation methods. The error bars that exceed the axis limit are represented as clipped. The theoretical extraction rate was set as the mean of the declared range content as follows: Bedrocan THC 2.05 (% w/w); Bediol THC 0.65 (% w/w), CBD 0.75 (% w/w); FM2 THC 0.65 (% w/w); CBD 1.05 (% w/w); and Bedrolite CBD 0.85 (% w/w). For details on preparation methods, see the following references: Method A ( Romano and Hazekamp, 2013), Method B ( Citti et al., 2016), Method C [ Società Italiana Farmacisti Preparatori (SIFAP), 2016; Casiraghi et al., 2018)], and Method D ( Calvi et al., 2018). The values are expressed as mean ± SD and calculated according to the equation EE% = (conc. Exp/conc. Theo) × 100. </caption>
