 <caption> Mean percentage of acidic and neutral form of phytocannabinoids in 4,774 samples according to the extraction method: (A) THC and THCA; (B) CBD and CBDA. The values are expressed as mean normalized to 100: % acidic form = [Mean acid/(Mean acid + Mean neutral)] × [100/(Mean acid + Mean neutral)]; % neutral form = [Mean neutral/(Mean acid + Mean neutral)] × [100/(Mean acid + Mean neutral)]. For details on preparation methods, see the following references: Method A ( Romano and Hazekamp, 2013), Method B ( Citti et al., 2016), Method C ( Società Italiana Farmacisti Preparatori (SIFAP), 2016; Casiraghi et al., 2018), and (Method D ( Calvi et al., 2018). </caption>
