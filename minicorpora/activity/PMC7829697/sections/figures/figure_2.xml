   <bold>A</bold>): Flow cytometric analysis of cell death with Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining after 24 h treatment of KG1, HL60, and K562 cell lines with increasing concentrations of essential oil. Data were analyzed by Kaluza software 2.1. (
   <bold>B</bold>): The quantification of myeloïd leukemic cell lines viability compared to PBMCs from a healthy donor after their treatment with the same concentrations of PV EO (0.01% and 0.02%). Data represent the mean ± SEM of three independent experiments relative to vehicle. The levels of statistical significance were
