 <caption> Impact of carvacrol, thymol, and their combination on the viability of the peripheral blood mononuclerar cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors. Flow cytometric analysis of cell death with AnnexinV-FITC/PI double staining after two 48 h treatments with different concentrations of carvacrol and thymol (individually or in combination). Data were analyzed by Kaluza software 2.1. Data represent the mean Â± SEM of three independent experiments relative to vehicle. The levels of statistical significance were set at p &lt; 0.05 (*), p &lt; 0.01 (**) and p &lt; 0.001 (***). </caption>
