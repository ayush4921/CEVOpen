 <caption> ( A, B) Cell cytotoxicity of Ptychotis verticillata Essential oil (PV EO) on myeloïd leukemic cell lines and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors. ( A): Flow cytometric analysis of cell death with Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining after 24 h treatment of KG1, HL60, and K562 cell lines with increasing concentrations of essential oil. Data were analyzed by Kaluza software 2.1. ( B): The quantification of myeloïd leukemic cell lines viability compared to PBMCs from a healthy donor after their treatment with the same concentrations of PV EO (0.01% and 0.02%). Data represent the mean ± SEM of three independent experiments relative to vehicle. The levels of statistical significance were p &lt; 0.001 (***). </caption>
