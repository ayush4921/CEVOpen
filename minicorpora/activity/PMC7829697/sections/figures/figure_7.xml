   <bold>A</bold>–
   <bold>D</bold>) Effect of carvacrol and thymol combination in cell death induction through apoptotic and cell stress pathways. (
   <bold>A</bold>). Flow cytometric analysis of cell death with Annexin V-APC/7-AAD double staining after 48 h treatment of KG1, HL60, and K562 cell lines with Thy 50µM/Cr 300 µM combination. Data were analyzed by Kaluza software 2.1. (
   <bold>B</bold>) and (
   <bold>C</bold>). Relative expression of genes related to apoptotic cell death. (
   <bold>D</bold>) Relative expression of genes related to cell and oxidative stress pathway. Data represent the mean ± SEM of three independent experiments relative to vehicle. The levels of statistical significance as done by Anova test were set at 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 (*),
