0: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a cancer of the myeloid lineage of blood cells, and treatment for AML is lengthy and can be very expensive.
1: Medicinal plants and their bioactive molecules are potential candidates for improving human health.
2: In this work, we studied the effect of   Ptychotis verticillata (PV) essential oil and its derivatives, carvacrol and thymol, in AML cell lines.
3: We demonstrated that a combination of carvacrol and thymol induced tumor cell death with low toxicity on normal cells.
4: Mechanistically, we highlighted that different molecular pathways, including apoptosis, oxidative, reticular stress, autophagy, and necrosis, are implicated in this potential synergistic effect.
5: Using quantitative RT-PCR, Western blotting, and apoptosis inhibitors, we showed that cell death induced by the carvacrol and thymol combination is caspase-dependent in the HL60 cell line and caspase-independent in the other cell lines tested.
6: Further investigations should focus on improving the manufacturing of these compounds and understanding their anti-tumoral mechanisms of action.
7: These efforts will lead to an increase in the efficiency of the oncotherapy strategy regarding AML.
