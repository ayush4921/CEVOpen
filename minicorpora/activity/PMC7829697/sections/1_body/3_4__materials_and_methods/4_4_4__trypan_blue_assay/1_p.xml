<p>A trypan blue dye exclusion assay was used to evaluate the efficacy of separate or combined thymol and carvacrol treatments in comparison to control treatment. Cells were seeded in 12-well plates at a density of 0.8 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/mL. At 50% confluency, cells were treated in triplicate with different thymol and carvacrol concentrations as well as their combinations. Then, cells were mixed with equal volumes of dye and mounted on a hemocytometer for counting under the microscope. The results are expressed as percentage of viable cells relative to the control. The following formula was used to calculate the percentage of viable cells: %viability = [number of viable cells (treatment)/number of viable cells (control)] × 100.
