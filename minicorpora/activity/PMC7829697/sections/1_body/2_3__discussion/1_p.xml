<p>Cancer is the second leading cause of death worldwide. Despite intensive research on the treatment of this disease, the molecules on the market face different obstacles. The high cost of treatment, the molecular heterogeneity of cancer cells, and the development of drug resistance are the major challenges to be overcome. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a cancer of the myeloid lineage of blood cells, with high molecular and genetic heterogeneity. The treatment is still expensive and may be associated with several side effects [

Herbal remedies and their bioactive molecules are potential candidates for improving human health. Natural compounds from certain plants exhibit antiproliferative properties and cell death induction in various cancers through different pathways, including apoptosis, autophagy, and necroptosis [

 <italic>Ptychotis verticillata</italic> (PV) is a plant used in traditional medicine to treat diabetes, hypertension, and other diseases. 
 <italic>Ptychotis verticillata</italic> (PV) is a plant known by the vernacular name “Nûnkha” or “Nanunkha”. It belongs to the Apiaceae or Umbelliferae family, and it grows spontaneously in North Africa, from Morocco to Libya. It is also found throughout the Mediterranean basin. PV is an annual plant with a slender taproot, rod erect, striated, and slender, with many spreading branches from 10 to 40 cm, without rosette of basal leaves. In Morocco, Nûnkha is an aromatic and medicinal plant mainly found in the eastern region [

 <xref rid="B16-molecules-26-00410" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The use of individual compounds or in combination rather than the essential oil is a relevant question to be investigated. In fact, additional information regarding the composition of the PV is needed. Analysis of the chemical composition of PV essential oil from Morocco was carried out using GC and GC-mass spectrometry. The oil was dominated by phenolic compounds (48.0%) with carvacrol (44.6%) and thymol (3.4%) as the main compounds. Plant phenolics constitute one of the major groups of components that act as primary antioxidant free radical terminators [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-26-00410" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The amounts of total phenolics and flavonoids in the solvent extracts (diethyl ether and ethyl acetate) were determined spectrometrically. Furthermore, the antioxidant activities of the essential oil and extracts were determined using a DPPH test system. The DPPH scavenging activity of extracts increased in the order ethyl acetate &gt; ascorbic acid &gt; diethyl ether &gt; essential oil. The antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of 
 <italic>P. verticillata</italic> (EOPV) and its different fractions has shown a higher inhibitory effect on different bacterial strains [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-26-00410" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Thus, PV is a potential rich source of antimicrobial agents against many microorganisms and could be used as an antibiotic or alternative. Although some reports have shown the anticancer effect of thymol and carvacrol, no study has yet evaluated the combination of these two molecules against malignant cells. Most importantly, looking for a potential synergistic action of these active compounds is required for an efficient treatment.
