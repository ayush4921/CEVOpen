<p>The expression of certain proapoptotic genes known to be responsible for DNA damage and able to induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and cell stress prompted us to analyze the expression of certain genes involved in oxidative and cellular stress. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00410-f007">Figure 7</xref>D, cell death induced by the potential synergistic effect is associated with the underexpression of PRDX3, GSTP1, SOD2, and TGFB, which provide antioxidant or ROS production inhibitor function. We also observed the overexpression of TXNRD1, which can serve as an ROS generator, and the overexpression of heat shock proteins and ATF4, which play an important role in reticular stress. These results suggest the involvement of apoptotic and cellular stress pathways in cell death induced by the carvacrol and thymol combination.
