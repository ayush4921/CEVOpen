<p>Different pathways are associated with drug-induced cell death, and it is important to elucidate cell death mechanisms to improve the efficacy of any tested anticancer molecule. Using the allophycocyanin annexin V conjugate (APC–annexin), which is useful for detecting translocated phosphatidylserine (PS), a hallmark of apoptosis, we detected a wide range of annexin+/PI-HL60 (34%), K562 (8%) and KG1 (10%) cells even after 48 h of carvacrol and thymol treatment (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00410-f007">Figure 7</xref>B, Car–thy combination-induced cell death is associated with a significantly upregulated expression of proapoptotic genes, such as BBC3, BNIPL, GADD45A, TP53, BAX, CD40, CD40LG, SYCP2, ATP6V1G2, NOL3, BIRC2, TNF, and FASLG. Some of these genes are significantly upregulated in all three cell lines, while the others are upregulated but statistically significant in only one or two of the cell lines. The BAX gene is overexpressed only in the HL60 line, whereas the caspase 8-like gene (CFLAR) is overexpressed in this cell line and underexpressed in the KG1 and K562 cell lines. The expression of CASP3, CASP7, and CASP9 was elevated but the only significant changes were caspase-9 and caspase-7 in the HL60 cell line. Interestingly, some antiapoptotic genes are also expressed: IGF1R, TRAF2, BIRC3, and XIAP (
