0: ObjectiveThis study aimed to determine the chemical profile of    Lantana camara leaf oil.
1: MethodsThe essential oil was extracted from dried leaf samples using the Soxhlet extraction method.
2: The oil was separated from the solvent and the bioactive compounds were identified using gas chromatographymass spectroscopy (GC-MS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).
3: The identified peaks in the mass spectrum were matched with the database of the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) library.ResultsThe FT-IR results indicated the presence of alcohols, carboxylic acids, phenols, alkanes, ketones, and primary amine compounds.
4: GC-MS identified 43 compounds representing 95% of the total leaf essential oil components.
5: Some of the major isolated compounds included a pyrrolizine; 1-dodecanol; 1,2-nonadecanediol; phytol; 1,3-dioxolane; 4-undecene, 9-methyl, (Z)-; 1-eicosanol; and imidazole.ConclusionsThe identified constituents of the extracted oil have established pharmacologic and insecticidal activities, and these compounds are also used in the drink, food, and cosmetic industries.
6: This extract is highly valuable for the medical treatment of various ailments.
