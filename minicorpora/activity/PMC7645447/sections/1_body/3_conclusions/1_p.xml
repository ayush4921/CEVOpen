<p>The Soxhlet solvent extraction method was applied to the leaves of 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> harvested in Ethiopia. The leaves were found to be rich in phytol, 4-undecene, 1-eicosanol, 1-docosene, imidazole, and pyrroline. This oil extract may possess antimicrobial, insecticidal, insect repellent, and cytotoxic activities as reported for most pyrroline- and phytol-rich oils. The wide spectrum of volatile components in 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> oil suggests that it may be useful for application as an antimicrobial for food preservation, as an insect repellent, and also as a flavoring agent in pharmaceutical and cosmetics products. The present study showed that the phytochemical composition of the 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> extracts varied depending on the solvent used for extraction. In particular, the total flavonoid and terpenoid content varied extensively with different solvents. Methanol extracts of 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> leaves contained more unique compounds than extracts obtained with the other solvents. Thus, this study affords a good foundation for further investigations of the biochemical and phytochemical functions of the various compounds identified, and the findings propose that the methanol leaf extract of 
 <italic>L. camara</italic>, with its numerous bioactive compounds, is a promising source of lead compounds for future drug development. However, further studies are required to fully evaluate the potential of this oil.
