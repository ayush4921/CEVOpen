<p>FT-IR spectroscopy revealed the presence of several functional groups such as phenols, amines, alcohols, alkenes, carboxylic acids, aliphatic compounds, carbonyl compounds, and esters. Representative FT-IR spectra of the methanol, ethanol, and ethyl acetate extracts are shown in

 <sup>−1</sup>, which were related to the vibration of the stretching hydroxy (-OH) groups. The bands found at 1629 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and 1630 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> might have resulted from the stretching vibration of the C=C groups, which include cyclic structures with a ring resonance bond that gives increased stability, and the vibration of the C=O groups of the flavonoids and lipids. The band at 1345 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> could be related to the CH
 <sub>3</sub> and CH
 <sub>2</sub> groups of the flavonoids and aromatics. Here, the vibration would be the bending vibrations of C-H and the stretching vibration of the aromatics. The bands at 1250 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and 1247 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> were related to the stretching vibration of the carboxyl group (O-H and C-O stretch), i.e., the stretching of the COOH groups in flavonoids and lipids. Bands at 1126 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and 1130 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> were related to C-O stretching in the ester groups. The band at 778 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> was due to C-C stretching vibration.
