<p>Another study conducted by Avato et al. [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] showed that 
 <italic>T. satureioides</italic> EOs exhibit a promising nematicidal activity against 
 <italic>Meloidogyne incognita</italic> juveniles (mortality rate of 10.6 ± 0.7%) and adults of 
 <italic>Pratylenchus vulnus</italic> (100 ± 0.0%) and 
 <italic>Xiphinema index</italic> (14.9 ± 0.7%) and that, after 48 h, this effect was dose-dependent.
