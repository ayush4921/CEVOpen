<p>More interestingly, Salhi et al. [
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] reported the antifungal activity of four chemotypes of 
 <italic>T. satureioides</italic> EOs from aerial parts, namely, borneol/
 <italic>α</italic>-terpineol, borneol/carvacrol/
 <italic>α</italic>-terpineol, borneol/carvacrol/thymol, and borneol/camphene/
 <italic>α</italic>-terpineol against fungal strains responsible of wood damages (
 <italic>Coniophora puteana</italic> BAM Ebw. 15, 
 <italic>Gloeophyllum trabeum</italic> BAM Ebw.109, 
 <italic>Oligoporus placenta</italic> FPRL. 280, and 
 <italic>Trametes versicolor</italic> CTB 863). The studied samples were harvested from four different locations in Southwest Morocco (Oulad Berhil, Amskroud-East, Aoulouz, and Timoulay Aksri), and qualitative and quantitative assays were used for antifungal screening [
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The results showed that, at a concentration of 1/500 (v/v), all tested chemotypes inhibit the growth of the tested wood-decaying fungi. However, the investigated chemotypes exhibited a variable degree of the antifungal effect. Therefore, the chemotype borneol/carvacrol/thymol was the most active against the tested strains, followed by borneol/camphene/
 <italic>α</italic>-terpineol, borneol/
 <italic>α</italic>-terpineol, and borneol/carvacrol/
 <italic>α</italic>-terpineol. Moreover, the highest antifungal activity was noticed against 
 <italic>G. trabeum</italic> with MIC ranging between 1/1500 v/v and 1/500 (v/v), followed by 
 <italic>C. puteana</italic> (1/1250 (v/v) &lt;MIC&lt; 1/500 (v/v)), 
 <italic>T. versicolor</italic> (MIC = 1/500 (v/v)), and 
 <italic>O. placenta</italic> (MIC = 1/500 (v/v)) [
