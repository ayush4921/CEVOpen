<p>Recently, El-Bakkal et al. [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] tested the antifungal effect of the EOs of 
 <italic>T. satureioides</italic> aerial parts against 
 <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic>, 
 <italic>P. digitatum</italic>, and 
 <italic>Verticillium dahliae</italic> using disc diffusion method and fluconazol (40 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/disc) as standard antifungal drug. Their results showed a promising antifungal effect, of the studied EOs, against the three tested strains, with inhibition zone diameters ranging from 31.50 ± 1.32 mm to 36.27 ± 1.15 mm compared to fluconazol (25.50 ± 0.50 &lt; Ф &lt; 28.00 ± 0.50).
