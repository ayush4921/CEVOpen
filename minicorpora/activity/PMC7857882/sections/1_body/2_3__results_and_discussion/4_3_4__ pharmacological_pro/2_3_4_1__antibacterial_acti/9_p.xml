<p>Recently, Meziani et al. [
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] studied the antimicrobial effect of EOs and aqueous and methanolic extract from thyme leaves against 
 <italic>Microbacterium testaceum</italic> and 
 <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic> endophytic to date palm by using different approaches including quantitative and qualitative methods. They demonstrated that the EOs were more active against both reported bacteria than aqueous and methanolic extracts (Фs &lt; 15 mm). Thus, these EOs have a great inhibition power against 
 <italic>M. testaceum</italic> (Ф &gt; 20 mm, MIC = 0.025%, MBC = 0.033%) and a good effect against 
 <italic>S. marcescens</italic> (15 mm &lt; Ф &lt; 19 mm, MIC = 0.033%, MBC = 0.05%) [
