<p>Another work demonstrated an antibacterial effect of EOs extracted from wild and cultivated 
 <italic>T. satureioides</italic> against Gram-positive (
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>M. luteus</italic>, 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, and 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic>) higher than against Gram-negative strains (
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (ATCC 25922), 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (CCMM B4), 
 <italic>Salmonella sp</italic>., and 
 <italic>E. cloacae</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The highest activity was found for 
 <italic>M. luteus</italic> (Ф = 49.17 ± 1.15 mm for wild TS, Ф = 29.67 ± 1.15 mm for cultivated TS), while the weakest activity was noticed against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (Ф = 30.33 ± 0.58 mm for wild TS, Ф = 47.83 ± 1.32 mm for cultivated TS). Moreover, a considerable activity was also noted against Gram-negative bacteria with inhibition zone diameters ranging from 19.00 ± 0.10 to 23.00 ± 1.00 mm. The microdilution approach revealed a promising antibacterial effect of the tested EOs with MIC values ranging from 0.45 to 1.78 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This remarkable antibacterial effect of the 
 <italic>T. satureioides</italic> EOs is concordant with the results of an earlier investigation, which indicated that 
 <italic>T. satureioides</italic> E.Os inhibit the growth of a panel of microorganisms (65 Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains), among which 
 <italic>Aeromonas hydrophila</italic>, 
 <italic>Vibrio cholera</italic>, and 
 <italic>Stenotrophomonas maltophilia</italic> were the most sensitive bacteria with respective MIC values of 0.14 ± 0.4% (v/v), 0.14 ± 0.0% (v/v), and 0.16 ± 0.0% (v/v) [
