<p>Khouya et al. [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] have evaluated 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> the anti-inflammatory activity of 
 <italic>T. satureioides</italic> crude extracts and fractions (dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, methanol, and aqueous) using croton-oil-induced ear oedema and carrageenan-induced paw oedema in mice and rats. The results of this study showed that topical applications of the dichloromethane and ethyl acetate fractions (1 mg/ear) reduced significantly ear oedema volume of 31.60% and 27.16%, respectively, after 4 h of treatment. The crude extracts exhibited the greatest activity, and its tropical application decreased significantly ear oedema (29.67%) 8 h after treatment. However, the methanol and aqueous fractions did not decrease ear oedema. Moreover, the results of carrageenan oedema assay showed that the ethyl acetate and methanol fractions (60 mg/kg) reduced significantly oedema induced by carrageenan during the first phase (16.40 ± 0.33% and 14.51 ± 1.40%, respectively) [

 <italic>T. satureioides</italic> exhibited a remarkable anti-inflammatory effect in carrageenan-induced rats paw edema and in croton oil-induced mice ear edema [

 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] investigated the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> topical anti-inflammatory effect of methanol and chloroform extracts of 
 <italic>T. satureioides</italic> leaves, using the croton oil ear test in mice, and showed that chloroform extract induced significant edema inhibition (at a inhibition dose ID
