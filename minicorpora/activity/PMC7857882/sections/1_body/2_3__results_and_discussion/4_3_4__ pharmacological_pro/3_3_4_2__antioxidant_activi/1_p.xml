<p>The use of 
 <italic>T. satureioides</italic> as a food preservative and against several pathologic disorders in Moroccan folk medicine encouraged the research teams to study the antioxidant potential of this plant species. In fact, several works reported the antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>T. satureioides</italic> EOs as well as its extracts obtained from different plant parts (aerial parts, flowering top, and leaves) using different methods such as 2,2′-azino-bis 3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) radical scavenging, ferric reducing power, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), 2,2-azobis 2-amidinopropane dihydrochloride (APPH), and
