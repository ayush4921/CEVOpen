0: Lannea egregia (Anacardiaceae) and   Emilia sonchifolia (Asteraceae) are plants used in traditional medicine in southwestern Nigeria.
1: The essential oils from the leaves of   L. egregia and   E. sonchifolia were obtained by hydrodistillation and analyzed by gas chromatographymass spectrometry.
2: Both essential oils were dominated by sesquiterpenoids.
3: The major components in   L. egregia leaf essential oil were -panasinsen (34.90%), (  E)-caryophyllene (12.25%), -copaene (11.39%), and selina-4,11-diene (9.29%), while   E. sonchifolia essential oil was rich in -himachalene (25.16%), (  E)-caryophyllene (15.72%), and -gurjunene (8.58%).
4: The essential oils were screened for antimicrobial activity against a panel of bacteria and fungi and displayed minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 156 g/mL to 625 g/mL.
5: Based on these results, either   L. egregia or   E. sonchifolia essential oil may be recommended for exploration as complementary antibacterial or antifungal agents.
