<p>To rationalize the antibacterial potential of PCEO, the binding mode of their major and highly potent compounds has been carried out to provide more insights into the interactions and examine their affinity with the catalytic domain of TyrRS from 
 <italic>S. aureus.</italic> The outcomes summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00205-f005">Figure 5</xref>, outlined that out of the twenty four identified PCEO compounds, the best free binding energy was allowed for viridiflorol (−7.2 kcal/mol) and the lowest one for β-myrcene (−4.8 kcal/mol). The presented docking data revealed that all PCEO phytoconstituents occupy active pockets of the proteins of the target enzyme.
