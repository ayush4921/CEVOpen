<p>Histological sections of the scarred areas of representative rats in each lot were stained with hematoxylin–eosin and shown in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00205-f005">Figure 5</xref>). The treated groups showed a high density of fibroblasts and collagen with some macrophages. In the healed biopsies of the reference group, there was a thin epithelium with a moderate density of inflammatory nuclei. However, the biopsies of the control group showed incomplete epithelial regeneration (Group 1) and delayed healing characterized by a strong infiltration of inflammatory cells marked by small round nuclei and strongly colored purple. The dermis showed pronounced hyperemia with macrophage aggregation.
