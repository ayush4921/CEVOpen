<p>All rats were weighed before and after the experiment. Results are illustrated in 
 <xref rid="plants-10-00205-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. A slight increase (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in the weight of the rats in all groups was observed after treatment. However, for the groups 1 and 2, these variations did not show a significant difference in average body (
