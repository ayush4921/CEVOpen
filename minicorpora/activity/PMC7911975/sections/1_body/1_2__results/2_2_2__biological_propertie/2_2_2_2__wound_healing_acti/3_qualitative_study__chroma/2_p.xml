<p>On the 7th day, an inflammatory nipple accentuated around the damaged skin of untreated wounds was noticed. However, a brown crust was observed in the treated groups (with PCEO and reference). It was thicker and rather hard in rats treated with the standard healing wound compared to the tested PCEO from fruit. This crust persisted in the group treated with PCEO until the 9th day of the experiment.</p>
