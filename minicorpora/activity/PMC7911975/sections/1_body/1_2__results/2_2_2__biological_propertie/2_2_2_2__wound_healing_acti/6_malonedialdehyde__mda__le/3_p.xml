<p>MDA represents the product generated during the oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Oxidative stress is characterized by ROS that induce lipid peroxidation, which contains a series of free radical chain reaction processes and is associated with several types of biological damage. In the present study, an increase in MDA levels was noted after wound induction.</p>
