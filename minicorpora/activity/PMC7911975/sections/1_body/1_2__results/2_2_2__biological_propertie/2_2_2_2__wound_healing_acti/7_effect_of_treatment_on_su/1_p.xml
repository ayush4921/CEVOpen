<p>SODs are ubiquitous enzymes that catalyze disproportionation of superoxide anions to hydrogen peroxide and molecular oxygen. The SOD enzyme plays a role as a powerful antioxidant that provides the first line of defense against the harmful effects of lipid peroxidation, it confers the property of “scavenger”. In healed rats compared with those without wounds, a significant decrease in dermal SOD activities was observed, from 148.58 ± 44.13 to 80.64 ± 9.01 unit/mg protein) (
