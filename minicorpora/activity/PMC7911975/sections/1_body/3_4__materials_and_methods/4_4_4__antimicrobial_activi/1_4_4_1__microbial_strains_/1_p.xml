<p>Antimicrobial assay was performed in in vitro cultures across 13 microbial strains, including 5 Gram-positive bacteria (
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> (JN 934390) as the most important cause of food poisoning, 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (JN 934392), which are endospore-forming, rod-shaped, facultative anaerobic bacteria that are widely distributed in nature, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (ATCC 6538) as a sphere-shaped bacteria responsible of skin infections and can cause also pneumonia and heart valve infections, 
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> (ATCC 19115) as a food-borne pathogen responsible for listeriosis, a sickness with a high mortality rate, 
 <italic>Micrococcus luteus</italic> (NCIMB 8166) is a non-motile, non-sporing cocci belonging to the Micrococcea family considered as a non-pathogenic saprophyte of human skin and eye), 4 Gram-negative bacteria (
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumonia</italic> (ATCC 10031) often causes bacterial pneumonia, or infection of the lungs, 
 <italic>Salmonella enteric</italic> (ATCC 43972) and 
 <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> (ATCC 19430) are the dominant cause of non-typhoidal 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> infections and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (ATCC 25922) as a pathogenic bacteria predominately found in the intestinal lumen) and 4 fungi (
 <italic>Pythium catenulatum</italic> (AY598675) known to be plant pathogens of both crops and vegetables, 
 <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> (AB586994), 
 <italic>Fusarium phyllophilum</italic> (AB587006) and 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> sp. (JX391934) frequently are responsible of skin infections and can produce mycotoxins, which cause various disorders, including cancer in animals and humans). The evaluation of the antimicrobial capacity was carried out based on the same protocol as displayed by Ghannay et al. [

 <xref rid="B64-plants-10-00205" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. The bacteria were seeded on petri dishes containing Mueller Hinton agar (MH) and incubated for 24 h. From these plates, bacterial culture was prepared in 3 mL MH broth for 24 h at 200 rpm and 37 °C. The optical density was read at 600 nm and adjusted at 0.08–0.10 density equivalent to 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/mL. 20 mL of (MH) agar were cast in Petri dishes 90 mm in diameter. After solidification, 100 μL of the bacterial suspension (10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/mL) were spread on the surface of the agar using a sterile swab. After 5 min of contact, 6 mm diameter wells were dug with a sterile Pasteur pipette in MH and each well was filled with 75 μL of sample. Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) was served as a negative control. The Petri dishes thus prepared were incubated at +4 °C for 4 h to allow the diffusion of the active substance. Finally, the dishes were incubated in an oven at 37 °C or 30 °C, for 24 or 48 h depending on the microorganism tested. The tests were carried out in triplicate and the results are expressed in mm. The bacterial strains showing sensitivity to the EO were selected to determine the minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations.
