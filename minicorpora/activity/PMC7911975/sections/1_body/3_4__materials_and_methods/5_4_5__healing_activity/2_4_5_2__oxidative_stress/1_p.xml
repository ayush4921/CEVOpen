<p>Oxidative status in skin tissue could be estimated from the concentration of lipid peroxidation and the activity of antioxidant enzymes, malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). To measure these indicators organs tissues were grind into small pieces and inversed into 2 mL ice cold buffer (TBS, pH 7.4); the mixtures were homogenized on ice using an Ultra-Turraks homogenizer for 15 min and then filtered and centrifuged. Supernatants were collected and stored until use.</p>
