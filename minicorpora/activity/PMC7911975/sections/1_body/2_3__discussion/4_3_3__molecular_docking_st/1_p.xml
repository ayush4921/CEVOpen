<p>The strongest activity of PCEO as new antimicrobial agents, prompted us to study the molecular docking inside the active site of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> TyrRS to understand their interactions and predict the affinity and the activity of the potent bioactive molecules. Our docking results (e.g., for eugenol: Tyr36, Cys37, Gly38, Asp40, Leu70, Gly72, Thr75, Asn124, Tyr170, Gln174, Asp177, Gln190, Val191, Gly192, Gln196 and Ile200) seem to be in good agreement with those reported previously by Beg el al. [
 <xref rid="B49-plants-10-00205" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In fact, these authors docked the bioactive compounds of the 
 <italic>Calotropis gigantea</italic> flower extract against TyrRS and found that eugenol can interact with the following TyrRS residues Cys37, Leu70, Thr75, Asn124, Tyr170 and Ile 200. These interactions are in full accordance with the binding residues involved in the ternary structure of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> TyrRS (Cys37, Gly38, Ala39, Asp40, His47, Gly49, His50, Leu70, Thr75, Gln174, Asp177, Gln190, Gly192, Asp195 and Pro222). Despite the antimicrobial contribution of eugenol and methyl eugenol (cited below), our docking results were well supported based on the literature survey. The sesquiterpene alcohol, spathulenol, displayed an inhibitory effect against 
 <italic>C. neoformans</italic> and 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic> and against 
 <italic>S. aureus, S. epidermidis</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> for 
 <italic>Helichrysum fulgidum</italic> essential oil [

 <xref rid="B51-plants-10-00205" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. In 
 <italic>Eugenia calycina</italic> leaf essential oil, the same compound present antimicrobial activity against anaerobic bacteria 
 <italic>P. nigrescens</italic> and 
 <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B52-plants-10-00205" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In 
 <italic>Salvia cilicica</italic>, it possesses an inhibitory effect against 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, 
 <italic>M. gypseum</italic>, 
 <italic>T. mentagrophytes</italic> and 
 <italic>Candida</italic> spp. [
 <xref rid="B53-plants-10-00205" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The sesquiterpene alcohol viridiflorol known for its lipophilicity founded into the phospholipid bilayers of bacterial membrane, inducing its disruption [

 <xref rid="B55-plants-10-00205" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. It interacts with the bacterial membrane and the consequences it bring out at the cellular level. Mechanistically, it interferes with the respiratory chain reaction and energy production [
 <xref rid="B56-plants-10-00205" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. It showed also antifungal activity against 
 <italic>C. cucumerinum</italic> and 
 <italic>P. oryzae</italic> [
 <xref rid="B57-plants-10-00205" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,
 <xref rid="B58-plants-10-00205" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The sesquiterpenes δ-cadinene presents a cadinane skeleton with farnesyl pyrophosphate as the precursor was demonstrated for its antimicrobial activity [
 <xref rid="B59-plants-10-00205" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The isolation of δ-cadinene, sesquiterpenes from the essential oil obtained from the fruit of 
 <italic>Schinus molle</italic> was found to be active against 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> [
 <xref rid="B60-plants-10-00205" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Additionally, caryophyllene oxide, an oxygenated terpenoid has been shown to exert significant antifungal activity [
 <xref rid="B59-plants-10-00205" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. It has been also reported to possess antimicrobial properties against a wide range of bacteria and fungi [
 <xref rid="B61-plants-10-00205" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Silva et al. [
 <xref rid="B62-plants-10-00205" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] have been showed that the antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of 
 <italic>Psidium guajava</italic> leaves was related to its chemical constituents, and especially to the known caryophyllene oxide. Thus, our in vitro and in silico results are in agreement with the study of the literature thus confirming the significant antimicrobial effect of the main constituents of PCEO justifying its future use as an anti-infectious agent.
