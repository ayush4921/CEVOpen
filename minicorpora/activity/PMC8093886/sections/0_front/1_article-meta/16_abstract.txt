0: In this study, the anxiolytic activity of   Piper nigrum essential oil (PNEO) was evaluated in the elevated plus maze (EPM) and the antidepressant-like effect was evaluated through tail suspension test (TST) in mice.
1: Flumazenil, a competitive inhibitor of GABA  A receptor in the benzodiazepine site and WAY-100635 maleate salt, a 5-HT  1A receptor antagonist were used to find out the possible mechanism(s) of action of PNEO.
2: To exclude the false-positive results due to the enhancement of the locomotor activity, the animals were submitted to open field test (OFT).
3: We also measured monoamines levels of the mice brain after acute PNEO treatment.
4: The data obtained from the study suggest that the anxiolytics and antidepressant-like effect of PNEO have observed in EPM and TST respectively in a dose-dependent manner after oral acute and repetitive treatment.
5: WAY-100635, but not flumazenil was able to reverse the effect of PNEO in EPM and TST both, indicating the possible involvement of 5-HT  1A receptor.
6: The neurochemical analysis showed no alteration in monoamine levels in mice brains.
7: Furthermore, no locomotor impairment or sign of toxicity or changes in body weight or abnormalities in the biochemical parameters, except for a significant decrease in total cholesterol level was observed after treatment with PNEO.
8: The findings suggest that   Piper nigrum EO possesses a dual anxiolytic and antidepressant-like effect through the possible involvement of serotonergic transmission.
