<p id="p0140">Our data unveiled a significantly higher biological yield and mycorrhizal dependency in mycorrhizal lemongrass compared to uninoculated ones. The obtained data are in agreement with our previous data indicating an accumulated biomass in mycorrhizal lemongrass compared to non-inoculated control (

 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Gomoung et al., 2017</xref>). Tentative explanation of such trait has pointed out foremost mycorrhiza (up to 43% colonization rate relative to the normal control) with their subsequent established repercussion on plant fitness. In fact, a set of physical and metabolic shifts occur in the host and its surrounding environment including the exploration of more volume of soil by extra-radical mycelia, leading to an enhanced uptake of water and essential micro and macro nutrients (

 <italic>F. solani</italic> Fs4 mycelial growth and conidia germination in a dose-dependent manner. The MIC were 500 ppm for the EOs, and 125 ppm for the Ridomil Plus 44 WP as far as the mycelial growth is concerned. The mycelial growth inhibition recorded with EO from AMF-inoculated lemongrass was significantly higher compared non-inoculated counterpart though non-significant. Reversely, the EO from (+)AMF was statistically more performant in inhibiting conidia germination compared to EO from non-mycorrhizal lemongrass. Similar inhibitory effects of EOs has been reported against a vast array of phytopathogens including 
 <italic>Alternaria alternata, Ralstonia solanacearum, Penicillium citrinum, Rhyzopius stolonifera, Phytophthora megakarya, Phytophthora nicotians, Phytophthora colocaseae, Phytophthora capsici and Fusarium solani</italic> (

Lemongrass EOs for instance has earlier been credited with hypocholesterolemy, antimutagenic, antiprotozoal, cytoprotection, antioxidation, and antimalarial and anti-inflammatory activities in addition to their antifungal potentials (
 <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Vazquez-Briones et al., 2015</xref>). The overall activities being more often related to their composition in neral, citral and geranial as major components (
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Adukwu et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Fokom et al., 2019</xref>). At the moment, clear mechanism of action undergone by any of these phytochemicals are still to be demonstrated but, it is well-known that EOs oftentimes act by disrupting the cell wall and cytoplasmic membrane of fungi and bacteria, leading to leakage of intracellular compounds and probably cell death by lysis. Otherwise, EOs components may disturb membrane channels and pumps, altering the ionic balance between the cells inner and outer compartments causing cell physical alteration and death without releasing the cellular contents (
 <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Tian, 2012</xref>). The increasing emphasis on EOs as genuine tool in the fight against disease and pest is not only related to the individual efficacy of their putative major components, but to the multitude of mechanisms driven by their chemically diverse constituents, which makes then important weapon to fight the resistance phenomenon. Therefore, synergistic relationships are likely the mostly indicated mode underlying the efficiency of complex mixtures like EOs (
 <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Vidyasagar and Tabassum, 2013</xref>). Many scenarios have been postulated accordingly. While 
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Kim and Park (2012)</xref> pointed out additivity and/or synergism between components bearing individual antimicrobial potential, optional mode indicates that non-active minors ingredients may act either as adjuvants by facilitating the influx of active principles having their target in the cytoplasm or nucleus or the optimisation of an active ingredient through the formation of more active chemical complex (
 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Shiota et al., 2004</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Sibanda and Okoh, 2007</xref>). The recorded discrepancy among both the EOs (from AMF-inoculated or not) could be due to the shift in the biochemical changes perpetrated in the composition of the essences of AMF-inoculated plants. Of note, inorganic phosphorus, which increased provision by AMF through mycorrhiza has been proven, are essential reactant in the biosynthesis of terpenoids; the major components of EOs (
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Ashour et al., 2010</xref>). Also it was observed in our previous study that the percentage of myrcene was significantly higher in EO from mycorhizal plant 14 month post planting than control lemongrass plant (
