<p id="p0145">Moreover, the EO extracted from mycorrhizal lemongrass protected the common bean plantlets from infection by 
 <italic>F. solani</italic> Fs4 both in laboratory and under greenhouse conditions, leading to healthier and vigorous plantlets with reference to plants emerging from 
 <italic>F. solani</italic> infected common bean plantlets alone. The best reduction in root rot incidence protection rate was obtained with EOs from AMF-primed lemongrass at the concentration of 1000 ppm (65.0%) while the lowest disease severity was obtained with the reference fungicide, Ridomil Plus 44 WP (63.13%). Similar reductions have been shown by several EOs towards soil-borne diseases in cucumber, melon, pepper and Cocoa (
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Nana et al., 2015a</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Amini et al., 2016</xref>). The recorded data are in accordance with the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> assays where a significant lethal effect of the EOs towards the conidia of 
 <italic>F. solani</italic> was evidenced. It is likely that once in the rhizosphere, the essential oils may have diffused in the soil and killed the infectious propagules providing a sterile environment around the seeds (
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Abawi and Pastor-Corrales, 1990</xref>). As a consequence of the disease reduction, the common bean plants grew faster but at doses 2000 ppm the growth of the plants were significantly reduced. This could be ascribed to the phenomenon of allelopathy which has long been cited as inherent attributes of EOs. Overall, we obtained prominent effects at 500 and 1000 μL.l
 <sup>−1</sup>. This promising output end to somehow resolve the issue of standardization of EOs, and provides a clear insight on the cost-effectiveness of the application of essential oils in open field. Indeed, seeds dressing require less amount of EOs and can address the volatility issue often cited as the most limiting factor associated to the use of EOs in crop protection.
