<p id="p0120">The results indicate that, seeds dressing with EOs significantly suppressed both the disease incidence and severity compared to the negative control (inhibitor-free seeds planted in 
 <italic>F. solani</italic> infested soil (p &lt; 0.05) with protection rate ranging from 0 to 65.0% and 0–63.13% for root rot incidence and severity, respectively. The best protection was recorded with essential oils from AMF-primed lemongrass at the concentration of 1000 ppm (65.0%) as far as the FRR incidence is concerned while the lowest disease severity was obtained with the reference fungicide, Ridomil Plus 44 WP (63.13%) (see
