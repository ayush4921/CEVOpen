<p id="p0130">The data displayed in 
 <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> unveiled the beneficial effects of bean seeds coating with lemongrass EOs and Ridomil compared to 
 <italic>F. solani</italic> infected and negative controls. While symptoms like leaves chlorosis, stunting and premature defoliation were observed in plantlets emerging from 
 <italic>F. solani</italic> infested pots only (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), reiterating the aggressiveness of the fungus. A substantial increase could be observed in plantlets whose seeds were previously dressed with either essential oils or the reference fungicide (p &lt; 0.05) compared to the untreated controls. Globally, the root and shoot length and their respective dry masses were magnified by approximately two-folds upon seeds coating with AMF-primed EO at 1000 ppm compared to other treatments. This clearly indicated that AMF-primed lemongrass oils, protected the common bean plantlets from being infected, leading to more biological matter yield.
