<p id="p0105">The inhibitory profiles of EOs from mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal lemongrass as well as Ridomil Plus 44 WP are shown (
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Obviously, and irrespective of EOs, the inhibition percentages increased as the concentration augmented. At the concentration of 500 ppm, for both the EOs, and at 125 ppm for the reference fungicides, no visible growth of the pathogen was recorded, indicating a significant difference between the EOs and the reference fungicide. Taken at concentrations range of 62.5–250 ppm, the mycelial growth inhibition exhibited by the (+)AMF] EO was higher compared to the non-inoculated [(-) AMF] plants though non-significant.
