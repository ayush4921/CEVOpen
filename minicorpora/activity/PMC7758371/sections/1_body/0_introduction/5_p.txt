0: Elsewhere, the symbiotic association between the roots of more than 90% of higher plants and rhizospheric arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) termed Mycorrhizae has been credited with improved fitness and altered host plants metabolic processes ( Smith and Read, 2008;  Yang et al., 2015;  Eke et al., 2015).
1: A straight relationship has indeed been drawn between Mycorrhizae frequency and the quantitative and qualitative changes in the EOs production of numerous aromatic plants including but not limited to  Ocimum basilicum ( Copetta et al., 2006),  Mentha arvensis ( Freitas et al., 2004),  Mentha piperita ( Mucciarelli et al., 2003) and  Chrysopogon zizanioides ( Adams et al., 2003).
2: Recently, a preliminary field experiment conducted in the framework of this study, aiming to screen out the effects of harvest periods and a local AMF inoculum on  C. citratus EO's yield and quality as well as biomass production unveiled an accumulated biomass and a deep shift in the chemical composition ( Fokom et al., 2019).
3: We thus anticipated that EO from mycorrhizal lemongrass plants could bear improved antifungal potential towards  F. solani, a recently described virulent bean root rot causing fungus in Cameroon.
