<p id="p0015">Soil disinfestation, and the usage of disease-free or fungicide coated planting materials may help in dwarfing the destructive effects of the phytopathogens. Chemically diverse fungicides such as thiram (Thiram 70 S), benomyl (Benlate), Dithane M-45 (Mancozed) and Captafol (Difolatan) have been screened out against FRR under greenhouse and open field with controversial outcomes, given the resurgence of the damages on fibrous roots out of the protection area at certain distance of seed placement (

In addition to the questionable efficiency of chemical fungicides, the worldwide trend toward environmentally-friendly approaches for plant disease control calls for steady mitigation of agrochemicals since they present extensive setbacks such as the development of resistances and non-target effects (

Isolated from medicinal and aromatic plants (MAP) plant-based drugs have occupied key position in traditional health care systems since ancient times. Moreover, the suppressive action of various EOs toward many agriculturally impactful phytopathogens has been evidenced (
