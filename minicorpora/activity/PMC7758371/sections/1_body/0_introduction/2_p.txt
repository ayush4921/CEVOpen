0: Soil-borne diseases are major crops yield-limiting factors threatening food security worldwide ( Erper et al., 2008).
1: Fungal plant pathogens like  Pythium spp.,  Rhizoctonia solani,  Thielaviopsis basicola,  Verticillium spp.,  Sclerotinia spp.,  Phytophthora spp.
2: and  Fusarium spp., have been cited as causative agents ( Abawi and Pastor-Corrales, 1990).
3: They may each infect independently the host causing characteristic symptoms, or in complexes, resulting in more severe cases ( Erper et al., 2008).
4: Among soil borne diseases, Fusarium root rot (FRR), caused by the fungus  Fusarium solani f. sp.
5: phaseoli (Fsp) W.C. Snyder & H.N.
6: Hansen has a cosmopolitan distribution.
7: The former prevails wherever common bean ( Phaseolus vulgaris L) is grown across the world.
8: In fact,  F. solani causes hypocotyl rot, seeds and seedlings decay at pre and post-emergences (damping-off) and root rot in common bean, with substantial yield decline culminating at as high as 100% in susceptible cultivars ( Mukankusi et al., 2011;  Nzungize et al., 2012).
