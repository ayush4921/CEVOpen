<p id="p0045">In order to ascertain mycorrhizae formation upon inoculation, fine lemongrass roots from each treatment were carefully collected and washed with tap water to remove farm adhering soil. Further, the roots were acidified (HCl, 5%) and bleached using 10% potassium hydroxide (KOH) and stained (63 ml glycerin, 875 ml lactic acid, 0.1 g acid fuchsine and 63 ml water) for 14 h on laboratory bench. The excess stain was removed with 5% lactic acid. Characteristic mycorrhizal anatomic structures were visualized under a Nikon YS100 microscope (100â€“400 magnification) and the AMF root colonization percentages was calculated as per the gridline intersect method from
