<p id="p0090">To ascertain the protective effect of the EOs oils under natural conditions, a pot experiment was conducted in the greenhouse of the Biocontrol agent's sub-unit of the Laboratory for Phytobiochemisty and Medicinal Plants Studies of the University of Yaoundé I, Cameroon. The growth substrate (soil) was collected from the A horizon of a common bean farm beneath the University and classified as Rhodic kanduidlut type following the U.S. soil taxonomy. The soil was checked for stones and woods particles from the bush and thereafter air-dried. The dried soil was then sieved with 4-mm mesh sieve and mixed up with river sand (3:1 v/v soil-sand ratio). The thus prepared substrate was autoclaved (121 °C, 1 h) twice, infested with 
 <italic>F. solani</italic> conidia (3000 conidia/g of soil) and filled in the pots (

Sterile seeds (GLP 190C) previously soaked in EOs or Ridomil plus 44 WP as described above were sown in the pots (3 seeds/pot). The pots were arranged in a greenhouse in a randomized block designed with 6 replications of 7 treatments as follow: (1) Control (non-inoculated soil and inhibitor-free seeds), (2) 
 <italic>F. solani</italic> (infested soil with 
 <italic>F. solani</italic> Fs4 and inhibitor-free seeds), (3) Fs_(-)AMF
 <sub>500</sub> [(infested soil with 
 <italic>F. solani</italic> Fs4 and seed coated with EOs from non-mycorrhizal lemongrass at the concentration of 500 ppm (CMI)], (4) Fs_(-)AMF
 <sub>1000</sub> [(infested with 
 <italic>F. solani</italic> Fs4 and seed coated with EOs from non-mycorrhizal lemongrass at the concentration of 1000 ppm (2CMI)], (5) Fs_(+)AMF
 <sub>500</sub> [(infested soil with

 <italic>F. solani</italic> Fs4 and seed coated with the reference fungicide; Ridomil plus 44 WP). 28 days after sowing, agro-morphological parameters were recorded, and the plant vigour was calculated (

 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Eke et al., 2016</xref>). The FRR severity was thereafter expressed in percentage as per the

 <disp-formula id="fd5">
  <label>(5)</label>FRR severity = ∑ 100∗[(DSi∗ n)/N∗DS]
 </disp-formula>Where: DSi = severity (1–9 scale) of a given plant, n = number of plants similar severity, N = total number of plants of the treatment, and DS = highest severity recorded (on the 1–9 scale).
