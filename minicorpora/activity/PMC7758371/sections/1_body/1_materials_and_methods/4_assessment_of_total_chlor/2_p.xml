<p id="p0040">Leaves chlorophyll content is an indicator of plants fitness. The impact of AMF on plant vigour could therefore be estimated through the evaluation of leaves photosynthetic pigments content. Briefly, 100 mg leaves of 14 months old plant were excised (fourth abaxial leaves), and extracted upon grinding in a mortar and pestle with 10 ml of ice cold acetone (80%). The mixture was centrifuged at 13 000g (Eppendorf, 5810R) for 2 min and the supernatant collected. The pellets were re-extracted thrice following the same procedure. The supernatants were pooled and the absorbance readout was done at 663 and 645 nm and the total chlorophyll content was calculated using the
