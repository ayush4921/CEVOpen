<p id="p0050">Fourteen months after sowing, the aerial parts of lemongrass plants from each treatment and replicates were harvested and pooled together to make a composite sample. The samples were immediately transferred to the Laboratory for Phtytobiochemisty and Medicinal Plants Studies and subjected to extraction by hydro-distillation using a Clevenger-type apparatus. The freshly harvested samples were weighed and placed in a heat-proof container. Tap water, representing two to three folds the total weight of the biological samples was then added and the overall was heated up and maintained to boiling point for around 6 h. The essences were collected by decantation and water traces were removed through an anhydrous sodium sulphate and stored in dark glass bottle at 4 Â°C until usage.</p>
