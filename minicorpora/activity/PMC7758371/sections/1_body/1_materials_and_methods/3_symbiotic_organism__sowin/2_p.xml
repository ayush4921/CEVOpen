Prior to sowing, 200 g of AMF inoculum containing approxymately 5000 spores and mycelium fragments were placed as seed bed in pokets made at 0.5 m interval (

Afterward, lemongrass seeds, obtained from the seed bank of the Department of Plant Physiology of the University of Yaoundé I were washed under running tap water and surface disinfected with 2% Chlorox (NaOCl) for 5 min and blotted dried. One seed was then placed in each poket and covered with a loose layer of soil. The control plots without mycorrhizal inoculum [(-)AMF] were instead provided with 200 g of sterilize inoculum [(121 °C; 1h), two runs]. The plots (experimental blocs) were randomly organised with AMF treatment [(+) AMF] and control without AMF [(-) AMF].
