 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-12-02518-f003">Figure 3</xref>. It is important that studies test the compatibility and concentration of the plant-derived bioactive compound in relation to the film-forming polymer because the properties of the resulting film depend on their combination and the proportion between them, as demonstrated by Silva-Weiss [
 <xref rid="B105-polymers-12-02518" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. The chemical interactions between bioactive compounds and biopolymers depend on their chemical and structural characteristics (stereochemistry, conformational flexibility and molecular weight), concentration and pH, which in return affect the structure as well as the functionality of the resulting films. Particularly, depending on the characteristics of the bioactive compound, the concentration to be added to the film-forming solution must be evaluated. In general, very high concentrations in relation to the polymer mass are not widely used because they can generate undesirable odors, turbidity and / or precipitation [
