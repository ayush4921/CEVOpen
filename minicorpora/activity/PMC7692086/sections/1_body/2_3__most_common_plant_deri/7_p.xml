<p>One of the great challenges to be overcome for future advances and insertion of bioactive and biopolymer films into the market is the standardization of the functional, barrier and mechanical properties presented by them. It is known that the amount of biopolymers (starch, protein, fibers, cellulose), as well as bioactive compounds (carotenoids, phenolic compounds, vitamins, among others) present in agricultural products and their byproducts (fruits, vegetables, grains, seeds, rhizomes, roots) vary in composition and quantity, depending on the conditions adopted in agricultural practices: planting (soil, irrigation, location); harvest (maturity degree); post-harvest (processing and storage conditions); part of the plant; and, mainly for bioactive compounds, how much the plant responds to environmental aggressions [
