0: Polysaccharides, such as starch [ 7, 8, 9], cellulose [ 1, 2] alginate sodium [ 3, 10], pectin [ 4, 11], chitosan [ 8, 12], gums [ 13, 14, 15]; and proteins, such as whey [ 10, 16], soy [ 17, 18], gluten [ 19, 20, 21] and gelatine [ 10, 19, 22, 23] are among the most employed biopolymers in the development of biodegradable films.
1: These natural biopolymers are commonly used due to their abundance in nature, biodegradability and edibility.
2: Among these natural biopolymers, starch stands out for its easy processing and low cost [ 1, 7, 8, 24].
3: Among the techniques used for the production of these films, there are casting, pressing and extrusion followed by blowing [ 23].
