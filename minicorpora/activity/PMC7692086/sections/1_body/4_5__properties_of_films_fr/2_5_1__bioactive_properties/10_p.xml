<p>Piñeros-Hernandez et al. [
 <xref rid="B81-polymers-12-02518" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>] studied the migration of rosemary polyphenols using water and 95% ethanol as simulants for aqueous and fatty foods, respectively. After 7 days of exposure to the simulants, it was observed that the films containing 4.4 and 13.6 mg (gallic acid equivalent—GAE/kg dried film) of polyphenols released 40 and 140 mg (gallic acid equivalent—GAE/kg water simulant) into the aqueous food simulant, respectively, whereas, only a small amount of polyphenols were detected in the fatty food simulant, less than 7 mg (gallic acid equivalent—GAE/kg 95% ethanol simulant) for both films. In ethanolic medium, a low amount of simulant penetrated the film matrix, unlike the aqueous medium, which quickly penetrated the matrix of cassava starch and glycerol, leading to the diffusion of a large amount of rosemary polyphenols into the simulant.
