<p>In addition to the location of bioactive compounds in the film-forming matrix, the way in which they are distributed also appears to affect the bioactivity of the film. Another major challenge is to be able to homogenously incorporate bioactive compounds into the film-forming biopolymer matrix. Studies have shown regions with particles of bioactive compounds agglomerated within the biopolymer matrices [

 <xref rid="B90-polymers-12-02518" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>,
 <xref rid="B117-polymers-12-02518" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>], or even segregated [

The lack of precision in the incorporation of bioactive compounds into the biopolymer generates variations in their distribution in the films, which contributes to the limitation in the standardization of their functional properties, as well as in the amounts of bioactive compounds released to packaged foods. It is known that the amount of any component that migrates to food depends on its initial concentration in the biopolymer and its solubility. Obviously, regions of film with particles of agglomerated or segregated bioactive compounds tend to have a higher concentration of bioactive compounds compared to other areas of the same film.
