<p>In general, the highest release rates of bioactive compounds to food or food simulants occur when the film-forming matrix is porous or soluble in the medium, or even when the bioactive compound has a high affinity with the surrounding medium. The longer the contact time between the film and the food or the food simulator, the greater the release rate of the compound. The strategy of using encapsulated bioactive compounds in films tends to generate greater protection from encapsulated compounds (degradation, volatilization, etc.) and a better-controlled release.</p>
