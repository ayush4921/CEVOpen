<p>The mechanisms involved in the release of plant-derived bioactive compounds from films of agro-based polymers in direct contact with food or food simulats are: diffusion-induced release (bioactive compound diffuses through the micro or macro-porous structure of the polymer matrix and is transported away from the film surface into the food); swelling induced release (in this case, the bioactive compound has a low coefficient of diffusion so that its release occurs, the polymer matrix must be placed in a compatible liquid or wet food and it swells when fluid enters its matrix and, as result, the diffusion coefficient of the bioactive compound increases allowing it to diffuse out of the film); disintegration induced release (the main reasons for this type of release are the degradation, cleavage or deformation of polymer) [

The characteristics of bioactive compounds (molecular weight and volume, polarity, solubility, volatility, affinity) and film-forming material (pore size, polymeric chain flexibility, polarity and packing density) in food or food simulants (pH, water activity and temperature), along with the time of contact, will significantly influence the interactions between them, as well as the release of bioactive compounds to the food or food simulants [
