<p>In addition, these types of tests are especially difficult due to the large number of external variables that must be evaluated, such as time and temperature conditions, quantity, and space between the film and the food. All of these variables can lead to different types of results, which is why the standardization of the conditions adopted in the release tests is so necessary. Advances in the specificity, sensitivity and selectivity of the appropriate analytical techniques to determine the amount of bioactive compounds present in films and in food will allow quantification of their migration to real foods. These advances in analytical techniques will also enable the achievement of more accurate results. All of this will help to fill some of the gaps that still exist in searches, such as: the lack of knowledge on the ideal concentration of each bioactive compound for each type of food; the release kinetics of bioactive compounds for food products (liquid, semi-solid and solid); and mainly how to control the unintended migration of bioactive compounds to food.</p>
