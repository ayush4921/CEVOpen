 <xref rid="B129-polymers-12-02518" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>] also observed that it was possible to control the release of curcumin-loaded starch nanoparticles incorporated into films with Aloe veraâ€“banana starch in different food simulants, changing the characteristics of the incorporated nanovehicles. Films incorporated with curcumin-loaded native starch nanoparticles, after 168h, reached 38.2% and 57.1% of curcumin release into highly lipophilic food simulants (simulant 1, ethanol 50% v/v; simulant 2, oleic acid as vegetable oil), while only 32.2% and 47.2% were released from films containing curcumin-loaded acetylated starch nanoparticles. According to the authors, acetylated starch nanoparticles encapsulated higher values of curcumin than nanoparticles of native starch nanoparticles due to the reduction of the starch polarity by acetylation. Although the same amounts of nanoparticles were incorporated, films containing curcumin-loaded acetylated starch nanoparticles presented higher lipophilic level. This might have made it difficult to extract the curcumin molecules from the films to the simulants in comparison to the native starch nanoparticles that were more hydrophilic.
