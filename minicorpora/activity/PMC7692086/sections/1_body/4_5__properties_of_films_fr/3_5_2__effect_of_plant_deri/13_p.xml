<p>For Almasi et al. [
 <xref rid="B114-polymers-12-02518" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>], the application of Pickering emulsions with marjoram essential oil into films made with pectin produced a highly dense and less permeable structure that resulted in good mechanical and water barrier properties for the film produced. The compatibility between pectin and loaded nanocarriers was confirmed by the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and field emission scanning electron microscopy.
