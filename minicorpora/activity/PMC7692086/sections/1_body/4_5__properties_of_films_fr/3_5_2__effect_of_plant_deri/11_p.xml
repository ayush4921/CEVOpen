<p>The increasing incorporation of curcumin-loaded native and acetylated starch nanoparticles (0.01 to 0.1%) into films made with banana starch and Aloe Vera gel also increased their tensile strength from 3.74 to 5.01 MPa and 4.80 MPa, respectively. This improvement in tensile strength was attributed to the strong interaction between the native starch nanoparticles and the biopolymer matrix. The small size and the high presence of hydroxyl groups on the surfaces of native starch nanoparticles allowed the formation of many hydrogen bonds with the biopolymer matrix, resulting in an increase in tensile strength. Lower tensile strength values found in films with curcumin-loaded acetylated starch nanoparticles in comparison to native starch nanoparticles were attributed to fewer hydroxyl groups present on the surface of the nanoparticles, due to the starch acetylation process, which consequently generated a weaker interaction with the biopolymer matrix. Nevertheless, the increase in film stiffness, due to the incorporation of nanoparticles, reduced elasticity (elongation at break from 56.3 to 45.4%). The presence of highly hydrophobic curcumin molecules limited the interaction between water and the film matrix, leading to a decrease in water vapor permeability (from 4.59 to 2.12 × 10

These results demonstrate that the properties presented by the films highly depend on the characteristics of the encapsulated bioactive compound, the characteristics of the encapsulating agent, and the compatibility between the encapsulating materials, bioactive compounds and the film-forming material [
