Drying and removing non-protein components from whey leads to commercial products such as concentrates (whey protein concentrate—WPC, with 25 to 80% proteins) or isolates (whey protein isolate—WPI, with proteins concentration ≥90%) of whey proteins, which are widely used in the food sector due to their functional properties as gelling agents, emulsifiers and foam stabilizers [
