<p>Whey protein isolate (WPI) has the ability to form films with a wide range of functional properties depending on their structural cohesion [

 <xref rid="B59-polymers-12-02518" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Films produced with heat-denatured WPI (HWPI) proved to be water-insoluble with good mechanical properties and excellent oxygen, aroma and oil barrier properties at relative low humidity [

It consists of a mixture of peptide molecules considered globular proteins. The cohesiveness and elasticity of gluten produce integrity and facilitate the formation of films [
 <xref rid="B67-polymers-12-02518" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Gluten can be obtained by pressing an aqueous mass of wheat flour and gently washing the starch and other soluble materials in a dilute acid solution or in an excess of water. It can be separated into two fractions: (i) gliadin, soluble in 70% ethanol, and (ii) glutenin, insoluble in ethanol [

 <xref rid="B69-polymers-12-02518" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] studied the addition of various concentrations of lipids into edible gluten films developed by the casting technique as barrier components to water vapor permeability. The effects of this addition depended on the characteristics of the lipids and their interactions with the protein structural matrix.
