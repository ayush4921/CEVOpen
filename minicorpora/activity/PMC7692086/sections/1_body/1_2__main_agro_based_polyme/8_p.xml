<p>Soy protein isolate (SPI) is a byproduct of the soybean oil industry, it comprises a set of macromolecules of varied sizes and structures formed from 18 different amino acid residues, being constituted by the soy storage proteins [

 <xref rid="B71-polymers-12-02518" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. SPI-based film usually shows lower permeability oxygen (O
 <sub>2</sub>) behavior in comparison to films based on low-density polyethylene, methylcellulose, starch and pectin. According to a study by Giacomelli [
 <xref rid="B70-polymers-12-02518" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] on thermal and morphological properties of films made with soy protein isolate, the thermal degradation of these films occurs in a single step, starting at 292 Â°C. However, due to their high hydrophilicity, films do not present satisfactory mechanical properties or a water vapor barrier for applications such as packaging [
