<p>In addition, most films made from polymers of agricultural origin are obtained on a laboratory scale, using the casting method. This method is based on the dispersion of macromolecules into a suitable solvent or mixture of solvents, thus obtaining the film-forming suspension that is subjected to thermal gelatinization. The resulting solution is deposited in molds of relatively small sizes (90 mm × 15 mm [

The difficulty of making films of large size (&gt;25 cm), with precise thickness (local variations in thickness) and short drying times, make current methods of manufacturing laboratory-scale films unsuitable for expansion into industrial production [
