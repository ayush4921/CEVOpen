Although encapsulation of the bioactive compound improves its stability, it is important that the methods and encapsulating agents applied are effective and inexpensive, so that these films can compete with current ones [

However, more research is needed to determine the ideal concentration of each bioactive compound for each type of food so that the antimicrobial or antioxidant action is detected, the release profile of the bioactive compounds from the film to the food is understood, along with how to guarantee a controlled release (time x quantity) during the entire storage period and distribution time of the food to the consumer [
