0: The cannabis plant produces an estimated 545 [ 2] chemical compounds.
1: The main biogenetic classes of compounds produced are shown in  Table 1 below.
2: These include primary metabolites, such as amino acids, fatty acids, vitamins, sugars, and proteins, and secondary metabolites produced in trichomes, the cells factory.
3: Primary metabolites provide nutritional value.
4: Secondary metabolites also provide nutritional value and include approximately 120 terpenoids (61 monoterpenes, 52 sesquiterpenoids, and 5 triterpenoids [ 2], over 26 flavonoids [ 2], lignans, stilbenes and derivatives such as dihydro-resveratrol (3,5,4-trihydroxybibenzyl) [ 3], cannabinaceous alkaloids such as cannabisativine and anhydrocannabisativine [ 4], and 20 steroids [ 2]), dihydrophenanthrenes, glycoproteins, and dibenzyls [ 5, 6].
5: In addition to sharing analgesic, antimicrobial anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties, a majority also share antioxidant capabilities [ 7].
