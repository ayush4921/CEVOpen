 <xref rid="plants-10-00400-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> below. These include primary metabolites, such as amino acids, fatty acids, vitamins, sugars, and proteins, and secondary metabolites produced in trichomes, the cell’s factory. Primary metabolites provide nutritional value. Secondary metabolites also provide nutritional value and include approximately 120 terpenoids (61 monoterpenes, 52 sesquiterpenoids, and 5 triterpenoids [
