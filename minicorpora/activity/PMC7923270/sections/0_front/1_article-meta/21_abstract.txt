0: The cannabis plant (  Cannabis sativa L.) produces an estimated 545 chemical compounds of different biogenetic classes.
1: In addition to economic value, many of these phytochemicals have medicinal and physiological activity.
2: The plant is most popularly known for its two most-prominent and most-studied secondary metabolites  9-tetrahydrocannabinol (  9-THC) and cannabidiol (CBD).
3: Both   9-THC and CBD have a wide therapeutic window across many ailments and form part of a class of secondary metabolites called cannabinoidsof which approximately over 104 exist.
4: This review will focus on non-cannabinoid metabolites of   Cannabis sativa that also have therapeutic potential, some of which share medicinal properties similar to those of cannabinoids.
5: The most notable of these non-cannabinoid phytochemicals are flavonoids and terpenes.
6: We will also discuss future directions in cannabis research and development of cannabis-based pharmaceuticals.
7: Caflanone, a flavonoid molecule with selective activity against the human viruses including the coronavirus OC43 (HCov-OC43) that is responsible for COVID-19, and certain cancers, is one of the most promising non-cannabinoid molecules that is being advanced into clinical trials.
8: As validated by thousands of years of the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes, vast anecdotal evidence abounds on the medicinal benefits of the plant.
9: These benefits are attributed to the many phytochemicals in this plant, including non-cannabinoids.
10: The most promising non-cannabinoids with potential to alleviate global disease burdens are discussed.
