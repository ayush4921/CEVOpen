0: Coronaviruses have single-stranded RNA as genetic material that can range from 26 kbs to 32 kbs in length.
1: Coronaviruses possess specific genes in Open Reading Frame ORF1 downstream region that are responsible for encoding the proteins responsible for viral replication, nucleocapsid, and spike formation [ 6].
2: The structure of SARS-CoV shows the spikes on the outer surface.
3: Furthermore, studies have shown that structural proteins are encoded by the four structural genes, which include spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) gene.
4: These genes are responsible for viral functionality and structure [ 7].
