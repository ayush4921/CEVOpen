<p>Science starts being considered in gastronomy, which, in its turn, is starting to be considered a science (see a reference to a Science &amp; Cooking congress in the concluding remarks). In this context, traditional knowledge on WFP, recorded by a discipline at the interface of social and natural sciences, has a very high value. If, as stated in the introduction, the 
 <italic>nouvelle cuisine</italic> started with an ethnobotanical basis, now culinary facilities are interested on WFP and in combining tradition and innovation. Additionally, some food products, such as the whole Mediterranean diet—to quote the one concerning the area studied in this paper—are inscribed on the UNESCO’s list of intangible cultural heritage. This is why restaurants, including high-gastronomy ones, often have contacts with people (not rarely botanists) who provide them with WFP. Further research on these aspects would most probably reveal many more cases than those we have quoted here of traditional WFP present in restaurants or touristic resorts, or permit the introduction, in the fields mentioned, of other WFP, thereby enlarging their utility.
