<p>Another indicator of WFP expansion beyond the local tradition is their transference from home kitchens to restaurants, in some cases, but not always, located near the place where one or another WFP is collected and popularly consumed. Some WFP of the studied area regularly reach the restaurantsâ€™ menu, as in the markets usually as seasonal dishes, but on some occasions all year round. The latter is the case of condiments, such as 
 <italic>Laurus nobilis</italic>, 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic>, 
 <italic>O. virens</italic>, 
 <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic>, 
 <italic>Satureja montana</italic>, 
 <italic>Thymus piperella</italic> or 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> leaves (

In any case, the former are more interesting, in the sense that they play a protagonist role in some dishes. Omelettes, or other preparations of 
 <italic>Asparagus acutifolius,</italic> are frequent in spring (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-foods-10-00061">Supplementary Material S2</xref>). A reasonable number of restaurants have contacts with people who collect the plants exclusively for them. Salads based on 
 <italic>Molopospermum peloponnesiacum</italic> or 
 <italic>Taraxacum dissectum</italic> also appear in some menus in spring.
