<p>Some WFP are regularly sold in local food markets, which is a first step towards commercialisation, with the added value of being seasonal products. These local markets are not always close to the places where plants have been collected. 
 <italic>Taraxacum dissectum</italic>, a Pyrenean endemic, is sold in Barcelona, particularly in one of its most important markets, visited by locals, but also by numerous international people: “
 <italic>es venen al mercat, sobretot a la Boqueria, en parades especialitzades. Venen del Pirineu</italic>” (‘they are sold in the market, particularly in la Boqueria, in specialised stalls. They come from the Pyrenees’) [

 <italic>Asparagus acutifolius</italic> and 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic>, are commonly sold in markets. 
 <italic>Portulaca oleracea</italic>, very common as food -and cultivated- in France, has not been a big success currently is Spain, but we have observed it in one market in NE Catalonia [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00061-f007">Figure 7</xref>), where the seller told us that this was a weed that used to be eaten and, since he had to harvest it to take care of the orchard, he preferred to try to sell it. The food composition data available for this species [

 <xref rid="B121-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>], together with the information on past and possible future consumption of the plant in the present paper, make it a good candidate for new food development in the territories considered and neighbouring areas (except for people with genitourinary troubles, due to its high content of oxalates). Among others, WFP such as 
 <italic>Helianthus tuberosus</italic> L., 
 <italic>Fragaria vesca</italic> and 
 <italic>Rubus idaeus</italic> are regularly present in markets in the area studied, as well.
