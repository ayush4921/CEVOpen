<p>The parts of the plants used for food purposes are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00061-f003">Figure 3</xref>. A practically absolute predominance of aerial parts is observed: the stem, the leaf, the complete aerial part (or the whole plant, the distinction between both categories being sometimes difficult), the fruit (including its parts, fructification and infructescence), and the flower (comprising its parts, inflorescence and floral summit) altogether represent 91.59% of the total UR. In contrast, subterranean parts are a small minority: root, tuber, bulb and rhizome encompass 2.20% of the total UR. Plant products (latex, nectar or sap) cover only 0.17% of the total UR. Finally, a 4.70% of UR correspond to parts not reported (most often ignored or forgotten) by the informants. The clear prevalence of aerial parts and minority subterranean ones is shown also, for instance, in research performed in the eastern Mediterranean region [

 <xref rid="B80-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. This consistency in quite geographically, culturally and socioeconomically different regions suggests a common pattern in parts of WFP used. This pattern is not intuitive, since everyone has in mind the relevance of subterranean parts in cultivated food plants, but it could be interpreted as an adaptation of the idea of Johns et al. [
 <xref rid="B86-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>] that the wild plants growing near the human settlements are among the most used. In this case the ease of accessibility does not regard the plants themselves, but their most apparent parts, which are aerial ones. The fact that the underground parts have to be harvested mainly in the plantsâ€™ vegetative state, making it difficult in some cases to undoubtedly identify the taxa, could have some influence on the situation described. In any case, a beneficial side effect may be mentioned, since, as stated by Pawera et al. [
 <xref rid="B80-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>], an intensive harvest of subterranean parts of WFP could be harmful in terms of plant conservation issues. Apart from this, a lower palatability of subterranean parts in respect to other parts of plants could be an explanation for their scarce use [
