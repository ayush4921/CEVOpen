<p>Out of the 278 taxa here recorded, 39 (14.03%) appear in the comprehensive dictionary of nutraceutical and functional food [
 <xref rid="B105-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>], indicating that a non-negligible amount of WFP has medicinal properties that make these plants, apart from nutritious, particularly salutary, and confirming the role of ethnobotany in healthy eating [
 <xref rid="B107-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. Some examples cited as nutraceuticals and present among the most cited plants (see

 <italic>Satureja montana</italic>, 
 <italic>Urtica dioica</italic>, 
 <italic>Taraxacum officinale</italic> and

 <italic>Apium nodiflorum</italic>, and propose it as a potential new crop, an interesting activity against intestinal parasites has been reported for 
 <italic>Origanum virens</italic> [
 <xref rid="B109-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>], used as a condiment, and a position as a commercial spice is proposed for 
 <italic>Crithmum maritimum</italic>, after describing a chemical composition compatible with nutraceutical properties [
 <xref rid="B110-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. These medicinal properties provide WFP with an added value for their local consumption that may be used in the development of new, healthy food.
