<p>The ethnobotanicity index (EI), considering the taxa at the specific and subspecific level, and considering for the total number of taxa present in the flora the above-mentioned estimation of 4200 [
 <xref rid="B58-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], is 6.62%. This is the percentage of the total autochthonous flora in the territory studied with traditional food (drink excluded) use. It is slightly lower than the 8.90% reported for one of the areas here analysed [
 <xref rid="B13-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], which is logical because in the latter case the flora is much more restricted and, in addition, beverages are taken into account. In Spain, Tardío et al. [
 <xref rid="B73-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] report 419 WFP restricted to edible use, as in the present paper, and Tardío and Pardo-de-Santayana [
 <xref rid="B82-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>], 464 WFP, including those used in beverages. Using the number of species and subspecies of Iberian, Balearic and Canarian flora (8882) provided by Pando et al. [
 <xref rid="B83-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>] minus 136 taxa endemic to continental Portugal [
 <xref rid="B84-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>], the EI for WFP in Spain as a whole is 4.79% (edible plants) or 5.31% (all food plants, including drinks), lower than the one calculated for the Catalan linguistic area for edible uses only.
