<p>Out of the 278 specific and infraspecific taxa recorded, 157 (56.47%) fit the reliability requisites indicated by Le Grand and Wondergem [

 <xref rid="B86-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>] of having three or more reports from independent informants. The number and proportion of taxa that would be the most indicated for further food development processes is high, encompassing clearly more than half the WFP recorded. Of course, plants with less than three user reports should not be neglected, since their low reports could be either the remnants of an earlier wider knowledge or the product of local cultural specificities and preferences, even in a globalised world. This is why all recorded WFP are presented in
