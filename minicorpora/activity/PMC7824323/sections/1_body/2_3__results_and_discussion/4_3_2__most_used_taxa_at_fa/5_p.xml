<p>Of the 30 taxa first classed in the ranking, there are many with current uses, despite an apparent acculturation, or traditional knowledge erosion, which takes place in industrialised zones. Even if in more of the studies occupying the present meta-analysis there are not quantitative appreciations of persistency of uses, our experience in ethnobotanical prospection allows us to comment on a few situations with the plants that occupy the first positions in the list. First, 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic>, 
 <italic>Foeniculum vulgare</italic> Mill. subsp. 
 <italic>piperitum</italic> (Ucria) Cout., 
 <italic>Laurus nobilis</italic>, 
 <italic>Rubus ulmifolius</italic> Schott and 
 <italic>Mentha spicata</italic> L., the top five taxa, are nowadays frequently used in many homes throughout the territory. Conversely, there is a pool of plants that are very well known and remembered by people but that have fallen into absolute disuse or that are very rarely used. This is the case of a set of plants that used to be employed as salads and which, since the ease of availability of lettuce and related plants in the markets, are now seldom used. Some plants of the lettuce family (in decreasing order of UR, 
 <italic>Reichardia picroides</italic>, 
 <italic>Chondrilla juncea</italic> L., 
 <italic>Taraxacum officinale</italic> Weber in Wiggers and 
 <italic>Cichorium intybus</italic> L.), and some other taxa (
 <italic>Papaver rhoeas</italic> L. and 
 <italic>Portulaca oleracea</italic> L.) are in this situation. The description recorded for this change in use is clear: “
 <italic>ara no cal anar a buscar aquestes misèries</italic>” (‘now there is no need to look for these lowly plants’) [
 <xref rid="B97-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>], but see later some nuances in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3dot6-foods-10-00061">Section 3.6</xref>. Finally, there are, in the first 20 positions, some other plants that continue to be in rather frequent use, in a similar way to those commented on in the top five taxa, e.g., 
 <italic>Asparagus acutifolius</italic> L., 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic>, 
 <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> L. and 
 <italic>Satureja montana</italic> L. It is worth mentioning that in one case, 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic>, the modern, recent use complements -and probably surpasses- the traditional one, as perfectly reasoned in this statement, “
 <italic>s’usa per a preparar patates a la cassola, guisats, guisats de pollastre, conill i en el cuinat de caragols, però també com a aromatitzant de la pizza</italic>” (‘it is used to prepare potatoes in the casserole, stews, chicken stews, rabbit, and in cooking snails, but also as a flavouring for pizza’) [
 <xref rid="B98-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>], which mentions first what is probably the most common use.
