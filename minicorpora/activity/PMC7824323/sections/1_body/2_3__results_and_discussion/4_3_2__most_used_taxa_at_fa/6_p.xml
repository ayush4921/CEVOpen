<p>Apart from being commonly distributed in general, the ease of availability, one of the reasons for traditional plant knowledge and collection, is given in terms of the proximity of plants to the place where people live [
 <xref rid="B86-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>], i.e., the floristic composition of the local landscape [
 <xref rid="B99-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. This is determinant for plant choosing, as we have verified in many punctual ethnofloristic prospections (e.g., [
 <xref rid="B16-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]) and we confirm once again in the present meta-analytic work. The informants remark that many plantsthey were or are collected not far from home: expressions similar to “
 <italic>creix pels marges</italic>” (‘it grows by the sides’) [
 <xref rid="B96-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>,
 <xref rid="B97-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>], meaning that the plant is found in small slopes or path sides close to home, is almost always pronounced by the informants, for instance, for one of the top ten plants, 
 <italic>Reichardia picroides</italic>. For 
 <italic>Papaver rhoeas</italic>, “
 <italic>n’hi ha molta</italic>” (‘there is a lot of it’) [
 <xref rid="B100-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>] is stated, indicating that it is very easy to obtain it. Apart from this, some of the highly appreciated WFP plants were cultivated (often originally collected in the wild, in some cases bought) near the house to ensure ease of collection, such as the above-mentioned 
 <italic>Ficus carica</italic> and 
 <italic>Laurus nobilis</italic>.
