<p>As for the species, the most frequently used one is 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic>, not far from 10% of the total food plant UR (
 <xref rid="foods-10-00061-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The statement of one informant “
 <italic>n’hi ha a totes les cases</italic>” (‘it is present in every house’) [
 <xref rid="B94-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>,
 <xref rid="B95-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>] is a clear description of the situation, well complemented with the following assertion: “
 <italic>jo esmorzo cada dia d’un plat de sopa de pa i frigola</italic>” (‘I have for breakfast every day a dish of bread and thyme soup’) [
 <xref rid="B96-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. The predominancy of 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> is very common in Mediterranean ethnobotanical research ([

 <xref rid="B48-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] and references therein). The top five plants account for more than one quarter of the total UR and the 30 first ones, near three quarters of them (respectively 27.85% and 73.57%, 
 <xref rid="foods-10-00061-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The five first plants in the ranking, the only ones with more than 4% of the total UR, belong to the top five genera and to four out of the top five families, thus reinforcing their relevance in the territory considered. The first-classed taxa exhibit the highest CI index values (
 <xref rid="foods-10-00061-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), which adds a cultural reason to the frequency of citation. To exemplify this, we need only to refer to an ethnobotanical survey in a geographically not very distant area, located in northern Iberian Peninsula, but belonging to another cultural group [
 <xref rid="B70-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], the plant ranking is quite different and, particularly, the only coincidence in both areas within the top 20 taxa (
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> L.) has there a CI index of 0.42 whereas in our study it has a value of 0.20.
