<p>The information concerning WFP has been recovered from the mentioned database. A minor bias exists, because in one out of the 31 studies included in the dataset [
 <xref rid="B65-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] each taxon is assigned to a municipality instead of to an informant, as is the case in all the other works. This can result in a slight underestimation of use reports and also of the indexes that include them. As WFP, we consider in this work wild vascular plants used for food purposes. Only edible uses have been taken into account, and a work is in progress on beverage uses (Gras et al., in prep.). Neither fungi and non-vascular plants, including algae, nor cultivated plants are considered. In both cases, interesting results for further papers exist; in the last one particularly with attention to local, neglected or underutilised minor crops. Under the term ‘wild’ we include strictly wild autochthonous taxa as well as some introduced or naturalised taxa recorded in the manual flora of the Catalan Countries [
