<p>Nevertheless, as a reflection on the long tradition concerning the management of many plants, a non-negligible amount of them is still used, and may have an important significance at a local level. In the Catalan linguistic area (CLA, i.e., the Catalan-speaking regions) studied in this paper the knowledge on WFP has had great importance during the Spanish civil war, World War II, and the years after these wars, as a subsistence or famine food, as also in other places [

In any case, WFP were also known, appreciated and used before these periods, and the traditional knowledge, which was cumulated not only in emergency episodes, persisted, thus allowing the current use of some taxa even further than at local level [
