0: Ethnobotany of WFP has been intensively addressed in all continents with a permanent population since the classical times of modern ethnobotanical research (e.g., among numerous papers [ 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 19, 41, 42]).
1: The CLA is among the best-studied areas in Europe at the level of traditional knowledge on plant biodiversity ([ 43] and references therein), and much of this information is collected in a database of our research group.
2: This database currently contains information of 3039 informants and 1778 plant taxa.
3: This represents a total of 118,537 use reports (UR), of which 69,170 (58.35%) correspond to medicinal uses, 31,415 (26.50%) to food (including beverages) uses, and 17,952 (15.15%) to other uses.
4: Several ethnofloristic or review papers focused on food plants have been published from this cultural area [ 13, 44, 45, 46] as well as more general papers containing information on WFP [ 18, 47, 48] or dealing with reasons for the use of WFP [ 9], but to date no attempts to carry out a global or at least major analysis has been performed.
5: Indeed, meta-analytical work on WFP in large areas is, as far as we can see, lacking elsewhere.
