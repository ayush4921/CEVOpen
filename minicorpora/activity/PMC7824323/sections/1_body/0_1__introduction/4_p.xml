<p>The heritage of ethnobotanical knowledge about food plants, and particularly that of wild plants, semi-domesticated taxa or minor, underutilised or neglected crops is of great relevance in food security and sovereignty, comprising both the right of any person to a sufficient and healthy nutrition and the right of peoples to culturally adequate food [

 <xref rid="B25-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Indeed, food and raw materials have been considered important for food security in different areas of the world, and WFP are important within these raw materials [

 <xref rid="B27-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. WFP are also taken into account in the ever more relevant concept of ecosystem services, as a survival value of cultural ecosystem services, basic for livelihood [
