0: Objective:The aim of the present study was to investigate antibacterial and antibiofilm activity of a few medicinal plants against oral bacteria.Materials and Methods:Salvia officinalis,    Lippie citriodora, Mentha piperita,    Echinacea purpurea and    Matricaria chamomilla were extracted.
1: Isolates from oral cavity were identified by microbiological and molecular methods.
2: Minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration were determined by Broth microdilution method.
3: The anti-biofilm activity of essential oils and extracts investigated and as a mixture by Broth dilution method.
4: Toxicity of the herbal mixture was assayed by in Wistar rats treated with intradermal injection.
5: Wound healing properties of the herbal mixture against infected wounds on the back of the rats were investigated.
6: Anti-biofilm activity was investigated on tooth surfaces.
7: Bacterial structure changes and fine- structure study were performed by light microscopy and Transmission electron microscopy.
8: Results:The lowest MIC and MBC for the plant mixtures was 0.0002 mg/ml belonged to    Streptococcus pyogenes and the highest values (0.025 mg/ml) belonged to    Eikenella corrodens.
9: The essential oils of    S.officinalis,    L.citriodora and    M.piperita, but not    E.purpurea and    M.chamomilla extracts, were able to remove the biofilms created by the studied bacteria.
10: The herbal mixture was able to completely heal the wound skin of rats in 21 days (p<0.05 compared to control).
11: The mixture was able to decompose the teeth biofilm in 45 seconds.
12: The results of light and electron microscopy showed that the bacterial structure exposed to the herbal mixture was deformed.
13: Conclusion:It was concluded that the essential oils of    S.officinalis, L.citriodora and    M.piperita had significant effects on inhibition of oral bacteria biofilm formation.
