These chemotypes contained also minor amounts of thymol (0.15â€“0.79%). Additionally, the chemotypes which contain one compound in a very high concentration were described by Nemati et al. (carvacrol 83.40%), Hassanein et al. (carvacrol 79.75%), Miladi et al. (carvacrol 53.35%), and Hajdari et al. (linalool 50.42%) [
