<p>After incubation for 62–70 min the absorbance increases insignificantly, namely a time of 66 ± 4 min is enough for the complete reaction of polyphenols with the FCR. Further measurements showed that increasing in a reaction time did not induce a significant increase in the absorbance. The square correlation coefficient (R
 <sup>2</sup>) of the absorbance dependence on the reaction time for 70–92 min was in the range of 0.8214 to 0.9686. The measurements at a wavelength of 760 nm for more 92 min give its insignificant elevation and a significant decrease of R
 <sup>2</sup>, for example, it was 0.7745 for 118 min, 0.6347 for 147 min for tincture T2. In fact, there is an insignificant increase in the absorbance (approximately +1%) for 92 min compared with the absorbance for 65 min for tincture T2. Similar effect was observed for tincture T1. According to the requirements of the State Pharmacopeia of Ukraine [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-25-04763" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], such a deviation is considered insignificant at the limits of active substances in the range of 90% to 110% of the stated content. Two experiments for tincture T1 confirmed the repeatability of the results.
