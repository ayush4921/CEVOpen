0: Some members of  Astragalus are well known for their pharmacological properties.
1: It was reported that many species and their isolated components possessed promising anti-inflammatory, immunostimulant, antioxidant, anti-cancer, antidiabetic, hepatoprotective, cardioprotective, antibacterial, and antiviral activities [ 3].
2: Phytochemical and biological investigations of  Astragalus have resulted in the isolation and identification of triterpenoid and steroidal saponins, flavonoids, phenylpropanoids, alkaloids, and some other compounds.
3: About 260 secondary metabolites were isolated from the genus.
4: They represent a very good source for drug discovery since most of the isolated saponins are found only in this genus, offering excellent lead drugs [ 4].
5: Astragalosides are the most widely studied secondary metabolites isolated from  Astragalus, which support the integrity of the respiratory tract [ 5].
6: Astragaloside IV is the most widely known saponin due to its high biological potential as an antioxidant, antiaging, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, and antiatherosclerosis agent, in addition to being active against hepatitis virus B.
7: Furthermore, polysaccharides isolated from many  Astragalus species have a markedly positive effect on supporting the deep immune function by restoring the normal levels and functions of many immune cells, especially when the immune system is stressed by either environmental or endogenous challenges [ 6].
