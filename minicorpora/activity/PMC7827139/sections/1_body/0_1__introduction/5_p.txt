0: The aim of this study was to investigate the chemical composition of the volatile components obtained from the aerial parts of six species of  Astragalus, namely,  A. sieversianus Pall ( Asi),  A. campylotrichus Bunge ( Aca),  A. lehmannianus Bunge ( Ale),  A. macronyx Bunge ( Ama),  A. mucidus Bunge ( Amu), and  A. chiwensis Bunge ( Ach) ( Figure 1) grown in Uzbekistan, based on GC-MS analyses.
1: Moreover, the metabolites differences between the species were explored by applying multivariate analyses based on the GC-MS analyses.
2: In addition, the volatile extracts were assessed for their antioxidant and enzyme inhibitory activities.
