<p>The aim of this study was to investigate the chemical composition of the volatile components obtained from the aerial parts of six species of 
 <italic>Astragalus</italic>, namely, 
 <italic>A. sieversianus</italic> Pall (

 <italic>A. lehmannianus</italic> Bunge (
 <italic>Ale</italic>), 
 <italic>A. macronyx</italic> Bunge (
 <italic>Ama</italic>), 
 <italic>A. mucidus</italic> Bunge (

 <italic>Ach</italic>) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00124-f001">Figure 1</xref>) grown in Uzbekistan, based on GC-MS analyses. Moreover, the metabolitesâ€™ differences between the species were explored by applying multivariate analyses based on the GC-MS analyses. In addition, the volatile extracts were assessed for their antioxidant and enzyme inhibitory activities.
