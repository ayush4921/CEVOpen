<p>The volatile components identified from the aerial parts of six different 
 <italic>Astragalus</italic> species revealed a significant variation between the species, as determined by GC-MS, which was confirmed by multivariate analysis. The essential oils showed relevant antioxidant as well as enzyme inhibitory activities. This study provides the first report about the biological activities of the studied species. 
 <italic>Astragalus</italic> species can be utilized as promising natural sources for many medicinally important components, which could be used for drug development to address illnesses such as Alzheimerâ€™s disease, diabetes mellitus and oxidative stress related diseases. Further studies are needed to test the in vivo activities.
