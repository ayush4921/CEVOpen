<p>Different protocols were performed to explain the antioxidant properties of the tested 
 <italic>Astragalus</italic> oils. The protocols included reducing power (CUPRAC and FRAP), metal chelating, phosphomolybenum and free radical scavenging (DPPH and ABTS). Experimental details were as previously reported [

 <xref rid="B34-plants-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The same applies for inhibitory effects of the 
 <italic>Astragalus</italic> oils tested against different enzymes (tyrosinase, amylase, glucosidase and cholinesterase) [

 <xref rid="B35-plants-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Both antioxidant and enzyme inhibition assays were explained by standard equivalents (trolox and EDTA for antioxidant; galantamine for cholinesterase; kojic acid for tyrosinase; acarbose for amylase and glucosidase activity). All samples were analyzed in triplicate in three independent experiments. The experimental details are given in the
