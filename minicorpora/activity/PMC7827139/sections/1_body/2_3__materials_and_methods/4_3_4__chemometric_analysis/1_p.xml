<p>The data obtained from GC-MS were subjected to multivariate analysis. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed as the first step in data analysis to provide an overview of all observations and samples and to identify and evaluate groupings, trends and strong outliers. Hierarchal cluster analysis (HCA) was used to allow clustering of samples. The clustering patterns were constructed by applying the complete linkage method. This presentation is more efficient when the distance between samples (points) is computed by the Euclidean method. Both PCA and HCA were achieved by utilizing UnscramblerÂ® X 10.4 from CAMO (Computer Aided Modeling, Viken, AS, Norway) [
