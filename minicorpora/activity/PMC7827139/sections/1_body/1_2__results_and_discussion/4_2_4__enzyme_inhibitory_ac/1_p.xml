<p>The enzyme inhibitory properties of the 
 <italic>Astragalus</italic> essential oils were investigated against some enzymes, including acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), tyrosinase, amylase, and glucosidase. The results are shown in 
 <xref rid="plants-10-00124-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The highest AChE inhibitory ability was provided by 
 <italic>A. sieversianus</italic> with 4.55 mg GALAE/g oil, followed by 
 <italic>A. chiwensis</italic> (4.52 mg GALAE/g oil), and 
 <italic>A. lehmannianus</italic> (4.51 mg GALAE/g oil). No differences were observed for the AChE inhibitory abilities of three 
 <italic>Astragalus</italic> species (
 <italic>p &gt;</italic> 0.05). The lowest activity was obtained for 
 <italic>A. macronyx</italic> in the AChE inhibition assay (4.01 mg GALAE/g oil). The BChE inhibition ability can be ordered as follows: 
 <italic>A. sierversinaus &gt; A. mucidus &gt; A. lehmannianus &gt; A. chiewensis &gt; A. macronyx.</italic> Observed cholinesterase inhibitory activities could be attributed to the presence of some volatile compounds, including monoterpenes. This was also supported by several studies, which reported significant anticholinesterase abilities of several monoterpenes [

 <xref rid="B26-plants-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The strongest tyrosinase inhibition ability was determined for 
 <italic>A. lehmannianus</italic> (138.42 mg KAE/g oil) and 
 <italic>A. macronyx</italic> (132.14 mg KAE/g oil). In contrast to cholinesterase inhibition, the weakest tyrosinase inhibitory effect was recorded for 
 <italic>A. sieversianus</italic> (118.20 mg KAE/g oil). The amylase inhibition abilities ranged from 0.76 mmol to 0.95 mmol ACAE/g oil in the following order: 
 <italic>A. chiwensis &lt; A. sieversianus &lt; A. campylotrichus &lt; A. macronyx &lt; A. mucidus &lt; A. lehmannianus</italic>. None of the tested essential oils were active against glucosidase.
