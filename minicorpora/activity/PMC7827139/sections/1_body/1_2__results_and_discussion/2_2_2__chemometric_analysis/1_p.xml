<p>In general, chemometric analysis together with chromatographic techniques provide a successful tool for discrimination between closely related species [

 <xref rid="B21-plants-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In this study, both principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchal cluster analysis (HCA) were applied to the relative peak areas of all identified compounds of different 
 <italic>Astragalus</italic> species to find out the relationships between different 
 <italic>Astragalus</italic> species and explore the similarities and differences between them. The PCA score plot and correlation-loading plot are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00124-f002">Figure 2</xref>a,b, respectively. In the PCA score plot, the impact percentage of the first two principal components covered 93% of the variance in the data. Different 
 <italic>Astragalus</italic> species could be divided into four main groups. 
 <italic>Asi</italic> was positioned rather remotely in the plot, highlighting an obvious dissimilarity from all other species. The closeness of 
 <italic>Ama</italic> and 
 <italic>Amu</italic> was evident, which fell in the same quadrant with 
 <italic>Aca</italic>, but obviously segregated. 
 <italic>Ale</italic> and 
 <italic>Ach</italic> were grouped together in a quadrant, but rather distant from each other. In-depth inspection of the correlation-loading plot (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00124-f002">Figure 2</xref>b) revealed the correlation between sylvestrene and geraniol, accounting for the complete separation of 
 <italic>Asi</italic>, far away from the other 
 <italic>Astragalus</italic> species. n-Triacontane and benzaldehyde were the key compounds accountable for the segregation of 
 <italic>Aca</italic> and 
 <italic>Ale</italic>. Regarding 
 <italic>Ach</italic>, a strong relationship between (
 <italic>E</italic>)-2-hexenal, butyl hexadecanoate, and undecanal was observed, accounting for its separation from other 
 <italic>Astragalus</italic> species. These results are presented in enlarged scale
