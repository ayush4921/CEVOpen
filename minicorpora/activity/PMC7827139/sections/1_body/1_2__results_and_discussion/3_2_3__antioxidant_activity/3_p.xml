<p>Only a few studies have been found regarding the antioxidant properties of essential oils from 
 <italic>Astragalus</italic> species, and most work has been carried out using the DPPH assay only. Ghahari et al (2018) determined the antioxidant properties of essential oil from 
 <italic>A. alopecurus</italic> and found a significant DPPH radical scavenging ability (IC
 <sub>50</sub> value: 146.59 µg/mL) [
 <xref rid="B22-plants-10-00124" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In another study, the antioxidant abilities of two 
 <italic>Astragalus</italic> (
 <italic>A. oocephalus</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>stachyophorus</italic> and 
 <italic>A. sericans</italic>) essential oils were investigated by lipid peroxidation, DPPH and reducing power assays. In the DPPH assay, the scavenging abilities were reported to be 134.22 and 44.43 µg/mL, respectively. In our study, we preferred to use the standard equivalent way for evaluating the antioxidant properties, rendering comparison with earlier studies difficult. However, the present results obviously represented the most comprehensive antioxidant profiling of the samples available so far.
