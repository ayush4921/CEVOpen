<p>Thiosulfinates and cepaenes found in 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic>, can inhibit production of arachidonic acid as well as its downstream pro-inflammatory prostaglandins and leukotrienes (Wilson and Demmig-Adams 
 <xref rid="CIT0133" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Thiosulfinates and cepaenes (100 µM) exerted anti-inflammatory properties mediated through inhibition of chemotaxis of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. It was also shown that cepaenes inhibit COX and LOX enzymes (Dorsch et al.
