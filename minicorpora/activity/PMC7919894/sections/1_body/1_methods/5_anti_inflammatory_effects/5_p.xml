<p>Vazquez-Prieto et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT1008" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) exanimated the effects of 6-week treatment with dietary catechin, quercetin, and a mixture of both, on tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and adipose inflammation induced by high-fructose consumption, in Wistar rats. Catechin, quercetin, and their combination at the dose of 20 mg/kg/day, improved pro-inflammatory cytokines expression such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MCP-1), resistin, and adipose tissue inflammation. In addition, catechin, quercetin, and their combination reduced the activation of the mitogen-activated kinases (MAPKs), JNK and p38. Also, catechin, quercetin, and their combination prevented downregulation of PPAR-γ.
