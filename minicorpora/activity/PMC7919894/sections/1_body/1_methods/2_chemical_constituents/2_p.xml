<p>Also, onion is a pool of free amino acids including aspartate (Asp), glutamate (Glu), asparagine (Asn), serine (Ser), glutamine (Gln), histidine (His), glycine (Gly), threonine (Thr), arginine (Arg), alanine (Ala), tyrosine (Tyr), methionine (Met), valine (Val), tryptophan (Trp), phenylalanine (Phe), isoleucine (Ile), leucine (Leu) and lysine (Lys) which supply the nitrogen content of onion and produce the characteristic taste called '

 <xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). The amount of chemicals in onion varies based on the variety, geographical location and storage factors. Some varieties including yellow, red, and pink onions have high amounts of quercetin compared to white varieties. The highest level of flavonoids such as quercetin is observed in the dry skin and thus, peeling may significantly decrease these components and affect health benefits of onion. In addition, various cooking methods can affect flavonoid content of onion. Boiling significantly reduces flavonoids, microwaving has less effect on flavonoids content while frying results in the greatest loss (Hedges and Lister
