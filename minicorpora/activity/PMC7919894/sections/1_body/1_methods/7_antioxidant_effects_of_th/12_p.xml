<p>In an 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> study, the antioxidant effect of 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic> juice (3 mL/day) on Wistar rat testis tissue and seminiferous tubules affected by 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, was evaluated and the results showed significant increases in total antioxidant capacity after treatment of animals with 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic> juice. Thus, this plant showed protective effects against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> infection-induced oxidative stress (Shahverdi et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0112" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic> aqueous extract (0.5 and 1 mL onion/100 g bw/day for 7 days) against cadmium-induced damage in prostate glands of Wistar rats produced significant improvements in oxidant/antioxidant status. These results suggested a chemoprotective capacity for this plant against biochemical alterations induced by cadmium in the prostate glands (Ola-Mudathir and Suru 
 <xref rid="CIT0092" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Protective effects of various doses (0.5 and 1.0 mL/100 g bw/day for one week) of onion aqueous extracts, were also indicated on sperm and testicular oxidative damage induced by cadmium in Wistar rats, which were mediated through reduction of LPO and MDA as well as improved antioxidant parameters (Ola-Mudathir et al.
