<p>In another study, the potency of methanol extract of 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic> to scavenge free radicals, was examined by DPPH and ORAC methods which confirmed the extract’s phenolic compounds antioxidant effects (Fredotović et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The radical scavenging and antioxidant activities of extracts of skin and edible part of 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic>, were investigated by Škerget et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0120" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Results showed a robust radical scavenging potential for the onion skin pure acetone extract, while the highest antioxidant activity was found for the onion skin extracted by 35 and 60% acetone and 60% ethanol. Also, a low antioxidant activity was seen for onion edible part in these experiments. Santas and colleagues (
 <xref rid="CIT0110" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) reported the antioxidant properties of three different Spanish 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic> cultivars including white skinned onion ‘Fuentes de Ebro’ white skinned onion ‘Calçot de Valls’ and yellow skinned onion ‘Grano de Oro’. Ethyl acetate sub-fraction contained the highest number of flavonoids and the TEAC was 74.86, 24.59 and 4.55 mol Trolox/g for ‘Grano de Oro,’ ‘Fuentes de Ebro’ and ‘Calçot de Valls,’ respectively. A potent antioxidant potential was also reported for the bulb methanol extracts of three 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic> cultivars including ‘Pusa Red’ (red), ‘Pusa White Round’ (white) and ‘Arka Pitamber’ (yellow) (Santas et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0110" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) and a strong antioxidant activity was shown for red onion ‘N-530 from India (Singh et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0119" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Benmalek and co-workers (
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) assessed the radical scavenging activity of 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic> and showed an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 2.91 × 10
 <sup>−5 </sup>mg/mL for the outer layer of red onion.
