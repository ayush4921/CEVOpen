<p>Vazquez-Prieto et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0131" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) indicated anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effect of onion so that oral administration of onion extract (400 mg/kg/day for 8 weeks) in fructose-fed Wistar rats led to attenuation of lipid peroxidation and NAD(P)H oxidase activity and decreased heart endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity that are related to oxidative stress. Also, they found that the vascular inflammation was decreased through reduction of VCAM-1 expression.
