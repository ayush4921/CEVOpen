<p>The effects of 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic> on the levels of oxidants and antioxidant markers in the BALF of ovalbumin-sensitised Wistar rats, were evaluated. Treatment with 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic> juice (0.175, 0.35, or 0.7 mg/mL) significantly reduced oxidant markers such as nitrogen dioxide (NO
 <sub>2</sub>), nitrate (NO
 <sub>3</sub>
 <sup>–</sup>), and MDA but increased the levels of SOD and CAT in sensitised Wistar rats (Marefati et al.
