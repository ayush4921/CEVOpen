<p>The effect of quercetin (1.25, 2.5 and 5 μM) on LPS-induced osteoclastogenesis in RAW264.7 cells, showed that quercetin reduced IL-6 and IL-1α, but increased IL-3 and IL-4 and down regulated NF-κB pathway (Oliveira, Figueiredo et al.

 <italic>A. cepa</italic> agglutinin (ACA) in normal and cyclophosphamide-induced immunosuppressed Wistar rats were demonstrated. ACA (1, 10, and 100 μg, intraperitoneal) increased TNF-α, IL-10, COX-2, IgG and IgA levels in serum and improved immune parameters such as cells of myeloid origin (RBC, WBC, and Hb), body weight, splenic index and thymic index in the spleen and thymus (Kumar and Venkatesh
