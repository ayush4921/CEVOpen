<p>Together, the available literature indicated protective effects of 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic> extract, fractions and its constituents especially quercetin, against several diseases associated with oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation in various body organs using different methods such as DPPH, ABTS, ORAC and TEAC. Treatment with 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic> and its derivative mainly quercetin, decreased lipid peroxidation and NAD(P)H, MDA, NO, LPO and eNOS but enhanced antioxidant parameters such as total antioxidant capacity as well as SOD, CAT, GSH, GPx, GSPO, TrxR, SDH, GST and GR activities and thiol level. Also, free radical-scavenging activity such as OH radical scavenging effect was shown for the plant and its constituents. Therefore, onion and its component such as quercetin, may be used as an antioxidant agent in treatment of disorders associated with oxidative stress. In addition, the results showed that quercetin could be responsible for the antioxidant effects of the plant. Antioxidant effects of 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic> and its constituents are summarised in
