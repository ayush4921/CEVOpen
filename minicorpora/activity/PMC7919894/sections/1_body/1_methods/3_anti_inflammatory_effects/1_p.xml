<p>Inflammation is a defensive reaction of the body to eliminate damaging factors and re-establish domestic homeostasis. In the process of inflammation, blood flow increases in the damaged site due to the release of vasodilatory agents, capillary permeability enhances, and migration of white blood cells to the inflamed site is augmented; these lead to emergence of classic symptoms of inflammation namely, redness, warmth, swelling, pain, and in some cases, stiffness, and ultimately, damage to the affected area (O'Byrne and Dalgleish 
 <xref rid="CIT0090" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). These changes are induced by cytokines and other inflammatory mediators (Dalgleish and O'Byrne 
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Cytokines are classified into two major categories: pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Several cytokines including interleukin (IL)-1, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), IL-6 and IL-8, and chemokines such as granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) play a key role in acute inflammatory reactions (Rothwell et al.
