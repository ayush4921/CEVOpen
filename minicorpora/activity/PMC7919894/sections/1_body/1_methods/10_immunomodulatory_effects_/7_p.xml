 <italic>A. cepa</italic> (10 and 30 g/kg, oral) was administrated to white leghorn chickens immunised with Newcastle disease virus (NDV), sheep red blood cells (SRBC) and 
 <italic>Brucella abortus</italic> (BA) which induced a dose-dependent increase in antibody titres higher than control, indicating stimulatory effect of 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic> on humoral immune responses (Hanieh et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Topical administration of two outer shells including the skin of 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic> aqueous extract (20 and 40 µL,) five times a week for three consecutive weeks from day 21 to day 41 to BALB/c mice with allergic rhinitis, reduced allergic symptoms, eosinophil infiltration of nasal turbinate mucosa, and OVA-specific IgE levels. In addition, levels of IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13 and IFN-γ decreased in groups treated with onion extract (Seo et al.
