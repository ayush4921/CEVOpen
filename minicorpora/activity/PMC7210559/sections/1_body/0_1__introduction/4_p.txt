0: Cinnamomum zeylanicum belongs to the  Lauraceae family that grows wild in India, Sri Lanka, Indochina, and Madagascar.
1: Its inner bark has been used as a potent therapeutic agent in ethnomedicine and as a flavoring ingredient in foods [ 6].
2: The antioxidant, antimutagenic, and antimicrobial activities of  C. zeylanicum extracts have been previously evaluated [ 7,  8].
3: However, to our knowledge and as seen in the literature, there are little published reports unraveling the mechanism behind the antibacterial activity of  C. zeylanicum bark essential oil against the most resistant and sensitive food-borne pathogenic and spoilage bacteria to the oil.
4: Therefore, the present study aimed to assess the antibacterial activity of  C. zeylanicum essential oil through a mechanistic approach to provide more information about its antibacterial mechanism.
5: The  in vitro antiproliferative effect of the essential oil on adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AT-MSCs) was also investigated.
