<p>The MIC and MBC values of 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic> essential oil against the aforementioned bacteria are also reported in 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. As can be clearly observed, the Gram-positive bacteria were growth-suppressed or killed in the presence of lower concentrations of the essential oil compared to the Gram-negative ones, mainly due to the presence of a single mucopeptide layer in their cell membranes that makes them to be more sensitive to the antimicrobial agents. In contrast, the cell membranes of Gram-negative bacteria contained a more complexed lipopolysaccharide and phospholipid layer with remarkably lower diffusion rate to lipophilic-based antimicrobial compounds of the essential oils [
