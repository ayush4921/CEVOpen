<p>The antibacterial activity of 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic> essential oil was investigated towards some pathogenic Gram-positive (i.e. 
 <italic>L. innocua</italic>, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, and 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic>) and Gram-negative (i.e. 
 <italic>S. typhi</italic>, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>) bacterial species, using disc diffusion agar, well diffusion agar, MIC, and MBC methods. The oil indicated a strong antibacterial effect towards all the microorganisms tested, as indicated in 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. It had a bacterial type-dependent antimicrobial activity; the highest and lowest inhibition zones were observed for 
 <italic>L. innocua</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, respectively, according to the results of disc/well diffusion agar tests. Moreover, a greater antibacterial activity or inhibition zone was found in the well diffusion agar compared to the disc diffusion agar assay. Indeed, the bacterial species in the well diffusion agar method are in direct contact to the essential oil, but the diffusion rate of the antimicrobial agent from the disc surfaces to the medium determines its inhibitory effect in the disc diffusion agar test [
