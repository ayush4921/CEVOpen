<p>Similar observations have been previously reported by researchers [

 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The compound cinnamaldehyde, as the main chemical constituent of 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic> essential oil, has been implicated in the antimicrobial effect towards Gram-negative/positive bacteria and fungi species, through inhibiting the formation of essential bacterial enzymes and/or causing intense damage to the bacterial cell walls [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Hence, the high antibacterial potential of 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic> essential oil could be attributed to its high cinnamaldehyde concentration.
