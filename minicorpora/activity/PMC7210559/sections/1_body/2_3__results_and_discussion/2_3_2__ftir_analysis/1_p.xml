<p>Essential oils are considered as complex mixture systems. FTIR spectroscopy was used to identify the functional groups in the essential oil of 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The peaks located at around 1678 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and 1626 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> are attributed to the vibration stretching of aldehyde carbonyl (C=O) groups, representing a high concentration of cinnamaldehyde and aldehydes in 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic> essential oil [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Other significant peaks were observed at 689 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (vibration absorption of alkanes), 748 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (benzene rings = CH), 973 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (C-H bond), 1124 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (C-O and C-OH bonds), 1237 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (C-O-C bond of aromatic acid ester and C-OH groups of phenolic compounds), 1294 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (alkanes CH2), 1450 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (alcohol C-OH bond), 1450–1626 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (C=C bond), 1575 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (aromatic C=C bond) 1626–1732 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (C=O bond of carbonyl groups), 2814 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (C-H bond of carbonyl groups), 2925 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (=C-H bond), and 3026 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (aromatic C-H bond) [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. All these characteristic peaks confirm that the essential oil is rich in phenolic and aromatic compounds, especially cinnamaldehyde.
