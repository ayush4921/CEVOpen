<p>Antiproliferative effect of the essential oil against AT-MSCs was analyzed in 96-well flat-bottom plates using MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide] assay, utilizing the method of Yousefi et al. [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] with some modification. AT-MSCs from healthy donors were obtained and (1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> per well) were seeded in the plates until 50–60% confluence was obtained, followed by replacing the medium with 2 mL of complete culture medium (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium + fetal bovine serum) and adding different concentrations of the oil (1, 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, 100, and 200 mg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) into each well. The plates were incubated for 24 h, and cell proliferation was then quantified by MTT assay. Each well was loaded with 30 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of 5 mg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup> MTT solution, and the plates were incubated in a CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator for 3 h. The medium was discarded gently, and the wells were charged with 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of dimethyl sulfoxide. The absorbance of the mixture was finally read at 570 nm using an ELISA reader (Convergent Technologies, Marburg, Germany).
