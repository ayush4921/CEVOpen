<p>The chemical compounds of 
 <italic>C. zeylanicum</italic> essential oil were identified by a GC coupled with a mass spectrometer (TRACE MS, Thermo Finnigan) with a DB-5 capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 
 <italic>μ</italic>m stationary phase thickness). The column temperature was increased from 40°C to 250°C with the heating rate of 2.5°C·min
 <sup>−1</sup>. Helium was applied as the carrier gas, and the ionization energy was 70 eV. The retention indices and mass spectra of the constituents of the essential oil were compared with the published data in the literature, followed by calculation of the retention indices using a homologous series of n-alkane (C
 <sub>8</sub>-C
 <sub>20</sub>) indices [
