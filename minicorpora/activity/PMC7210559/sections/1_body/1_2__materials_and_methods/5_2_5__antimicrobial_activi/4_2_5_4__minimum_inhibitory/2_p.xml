<p>Firstly, the sequential concentrations of the essential oil (100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.125, 1.562, 0.78, and 0.39 mg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) were prepared in MHB medium and sterilized using 0.45 
 <italic>μ</italic>m syringe filters. Each concentration (200 
 <italic>μ</italic>L) of the oil was added to the wells (in 96-well plates) which were previously filled with 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of microbial suspensions. After incubation of the plate at 37°C for 24 h, triphenyltetrazolium chloride solution (5%, 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>L) was added and the plate was reincubated. The lowest concentration of the oil with microbial growth-suppression effect, indicated by the lack of dark-red color in the wells, was considered as the MIC.
