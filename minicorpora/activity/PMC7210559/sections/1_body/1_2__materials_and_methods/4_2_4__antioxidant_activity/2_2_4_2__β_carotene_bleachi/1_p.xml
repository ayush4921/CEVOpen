<p>The procedure of Ribeiro-Santos et al. [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] was used to perform this assay. 1 mL of 
 <italic>β</italic>-carotene solution (2 mg 
 <italic>β</italic>-carotene in chloroform) was mixed with Tween 40 (200 mg) and linoleic acid (20 mg). The chloroform was evaporated by vacuum drying of the mixture at 40°C and then oxygenated ultrapure water (50 mL) was added. Afterwards, the solution was vigorously shaken to form a linoleic acid/
 <italic>β</italic>-carotene emulsion, which (5 mL) was subsequently incorporated with the essential oil (200 
 <italic>μ</italic>L). The resultant mixture was heated in water bath for 120 min, and its absorbance was then recorded at 470 nm (A
 <sub>S120</sub>). The control sample was prepared according to the same procedure, but methanol was used instead of the essential oil. The absorbance of the control sample was also recorded at 470 nm before (A
 <sub>C0</sub>) and after 120 min (A
 <sub>C120</sub>) incubation time. The antioxidant activity of the oil was then calculated using the below equation:
