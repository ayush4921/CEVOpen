<p>MRSA poses a high risk to patients due to the development of biofilm [
 <xref rid="B3-pharmaceuticals-13-00369" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Biofilm is considered as major virulence factor and is an organized structure built by almost all bacteria that is composed of nucleic acids, lipids, proteins, and polysaccharides [
 <xref rid="B4-pharmaceuticals-13-00369" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Biofilms contribute to &gt;80% of human infections and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> is considered as the leading species in biofilm-associated infections [
 <xref rid="B5-pharmaceuticals-13-00369" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In Biofilm, MRSA like other bacteria, become more persistent in the host organism, environment, and medical surfaces, and show an increased resistance to antibiotics and host immune factors [
 <xref rid="B6-pharmaceuticals-13-00369" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-pharmaceuticals-13-00369" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-pharmaceuticals-13-00369" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], which is an important medical problem. Therefore, the development of novel compounds to treat biofilm is urgently required; plant essentials oils (EOs) that act against bacterial biofilm are of great interest.
