0: MRSA poses a high risk to patients due to the development of biofilm [ 3].
1: Biofilm is considered as major virulence factor and is an organized structure built by almost all bacteria that is composed of nucleic acids, lipids, proteins, and polysaccharides [ 4].
2: Biofilms contribute to >80% of human infections and  S. aureus is considered as the leading species in biofilm-associated infections [ 5].
3: In Biofilm, MRSA like other bacteria, become more persistent in the host organism, environment, and medical surfaces, and show an increased resistance to antibiotics and host immune factors [ 6, 7, 8], which is an important medical problem.
4: Therefore, the development of novel compounds to treat biofilm is urgently required; plant essentials oils (EOs) that act against bacterial biofilm are of great interest.
