0: Rosmarinus officinalis L.,  Thymus zygis L., and  Origanum majorana L. belong to the Lamiaceae family.
1: EOs obtained from aerial parts of the flowering stage of these plants, have been reported for their antibacterial activities against  S. aureus [ 11, 12] and their antibiofilm activities against uropathogenic  E. coli [ 13].
2: Several reports have shown that tea tree, thyme, and peppermint EOs, are effective against planktonic [ 14] and biofilm [ 15, 16] MRSA.
3: In addition, Caceres et al.
4: [ 17] demonstrated high anti-biofilm activity of thymol-carvacrol-chemotype (II) oil from  Lippia origanoides against  E. coli and  S. epidermidis.
5: However, these oils did not alter the growth rate of planktonic bacteria.
6: The antibacterial effect of EOs, which is manifested by alterations of the bacterial cell wall and cell membrane, depends of their chemical composition [ 18].
7: The cell membrane compositions play an important role in the high resistance of Gram-negative bacteria to EOs compared to Gram-positive [ 19].
8: The hydrophobic molecules penetrate easily into the cells due to cell wall structure in Gram-positive bacteria and act on the cell wall and within the cytoplasm [ 20].
