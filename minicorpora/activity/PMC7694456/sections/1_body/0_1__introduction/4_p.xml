 <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> L., 
 <italic>Thymus zygis</italic> L., and 
 <italic>Origanum majorana</italic> L. belong to the Lamiaceae family. EOs obtained from aerial parts of the flowering stage of these plants, have been reported for their antibacterial activities against

 <xref rid="B17-pharmaceuticals-13-00369" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] demonstrated high anti-biofilm activity of thymol-carvacrol-chemotype (II) oil from 
 <italic>Lippia origanoides</italic> against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>. However, these oils did not alter the growth rate of planktonic bacteria. The antibacterial effect of EOs, which is manifested by alterations of the bacterial cell wall and cell membrane, depends of their chemical composition [

 <xref rid="B19-pharmaceuticals-13-00369" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The hydrophobic molecules penetrate easily into the cells due to cell wall structure in Gram-positive bacteria and act on the cell wall and within the cytoplasm [
