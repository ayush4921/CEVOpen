0: Methicillin-resistant   Staphylococcus aureus is a major human pathogen that poses a high risk to patients due to the development of biofilm.
1: Biofilms, are complex biological systems difficult to treat by conventional antibiotic therapy, which contributes to >80% of humans infections.
2: In this report, we examined the antibacterial activity of   Origanum majorana,   Rosmarinus officinalis, and   Thymus zygis medicinal plant essential oils against MRSA clinical isolates using disc diffusion and MIC methods.
3: Moreover, biofilm inhibition and eradication activities of oils were evaluated by crystal violet.
4: Gas chromatographymass spectrometry analysis revealed variations between oils in terms of component numbers in addition to their percentages.
5: Antibacterial activity testing showed a strong effect of these oils against MRSA isolates, and   T. zygis had the highest activity succeeded by   O. majorana and   R. officinalis.
6: Investigated oils demonstrated high biofilm inhibition and eradication actions, with the percentage of inhibition ranging from 10.20 to 95.91%, and the percentage of eradication ranging from 12.65 to 98.01%.
7: O. majorana oil had the highest biofilm inhibition and eradication activities.
8: Accordingly, oils revealed powerful antibacterial and antibiofilm activities against MRSA isolates and could be a good alternative for antibiotics substitution.
