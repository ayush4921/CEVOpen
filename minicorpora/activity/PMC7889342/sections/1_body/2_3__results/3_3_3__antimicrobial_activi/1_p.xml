<p>The MIC and MBC values for the 
 <italic>T. daenensis</italic> oils are listed in 
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. Generally, Gram-positive bacteria indicated high sensitivity against the 
 <italic>T. daenensis oils</italic> antibacterial effects (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> are the most resistant and sensitive strains amongst the Gram-negative strains, respectively. 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aurous</italic> and 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> indicated the most resistance and sensitivity against the oils antibacterial effects, in the Gram-positive strains. TD5, TD3, and TD10 extracts were the most potent antimicrobial oils, while TD2 was the least bioactive oil against all of the bacterial strains. Additionally, diversity in oils compositions led to differences in antifungal activity. The MIC values of 
 <italic>T. daenensis</italic> extracts for 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>Aspergillus Niger</italic> were 0.13–0.58 mg/ml and around 0.08–0.1 mg/ml respectively. The MFC spectrum of the 
 <italic>T. daenensis</italic> methanol extracts against the 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> (0.13–0.58 mg/ml) and 
 <italic>Aspergillus Niger</italic> (0.16–0.7 mg/ml) was determined using the adapted broth microdilution assay (
