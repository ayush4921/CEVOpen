<p>All of the essential oils ecotypes were examined for their fungal toxic activities individually, by an adapted broth microdilution assay. The 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> was cultured in Sabouraud dextrose agar at 30°C for a week and also stored at 4°C for another week in order to spore germinating. The fungal spores were suspended in sterile normal saline solution supplemented with 0.1% v/v Tween-80, and isolated using several sterile cheesecloth aseptically layers. That flow through the spore suspension was counted using a hemocytometer and adjusted at 10
 <sup>6</sup> spores/ml. 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of the conidial spore suspensions was added to 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of the essential oil serial dilutions from 0.01 to 5.12 mg/ml in Sabouraud dextrose broth. The plates were shaken for 30 seconds and after that incubated at 28 ± 0.5°C and in 80% relative humidity for 72 hours. Appropriate negative controls containing the standard fungal spore suspensions, and DMSO without the test components were produced, in order to confirm the sporangiospores viability, and any unwanted intrinsic effects absence. A fresh Sabouraud dextrose culture was diluted and adjusted to 5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU/ml for 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, and 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of the suspension was dispensed in a 96-well plate containing 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of serially diluted oils and was cultivated for 48 hours at 28°C. The pure amphotericin-B serial dilution (0.1–12.8 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) was used as the reference compound. MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) was the least oil concentration and represented no visible fungal mycelia next to the incubation period. A 5 
 <italic>μ</italic>l portion was subcultivated on Sabouraud dextrose agar and was from the wells with complete fungal growth inhibition and incubated for 72 hours at 28°C. MFC (minimum fungicidal concentration) was considered as the lowest oil concentration that killed ≥99.5% of the inoculated fungi [
