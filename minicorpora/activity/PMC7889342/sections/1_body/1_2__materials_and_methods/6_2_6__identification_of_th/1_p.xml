<p>Volatile constituents were identified using a gas chromatograph (Agilent, GC-7890A, USA) connected to an Electron Ionization Mass Spectroscopy, EIMS-5975C, detector (70 eV energy), and a capillary HP-5 MS well-packed column containing 95% of the methylpolysiloxane, and 5% of phenyl (dimensions: 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 
 <italic>μ</italic>m). The central oven was preset for 5 minutes at 40°C. After that, the temperature was progressively increased to 230°C for 20 minutes, and at the final step, temperature was raised up to 280°C for 2 minutes (30°C/min ramping rate). Detector and injector temperatures were fixed at 240 and 250°C, respectively. One 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of the oils was injected with a split ratio of 1 : 10 to the instrument, and also the helium flow rate was tuned to 1 ml/min. The GC-MS analysis was completed using various internal standards for components quantification. The oil components arrangement was conducted based on the retention index ratios along with the homologous normal alkane series retention times under the same running condition. Additional parameters, which were used for the composition description, were the Wiley7n.L library, NIST library, published data fragmentation model, and the authentic compounds mass spectroscopy. The results were expressed as percentages of the individual constituent whole peak area in association with the whole region of all standardized peaks in the chromatogram [
