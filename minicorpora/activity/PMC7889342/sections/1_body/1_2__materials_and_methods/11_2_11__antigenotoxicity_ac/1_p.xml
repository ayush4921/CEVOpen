<p>Comet assay is a highly sensitive method for studying of the compounds antigenotoxic activity against the DNA damage in lymphocytes. Lymphocytes were isolated from the volunteer blood samples using Ficoll-Paque TM PLUS2, and a cell suspension of 2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/ml was prepared in the phosphate buffered saline. Then, 1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells were treated with the sampled oils serial concentration (0.01–5 mg/ml) for 30 minutes at 4°C. The cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of PBS and were finally mixed with the equal preheated low-melting-point agarose volume (1.5% w/v). By passing 30 minutes from incubation in ice, the cells were coated again with 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of low-melting agarose (0.75% w/v) in order to form a flat sandwich. After that, cell lysis was performed using ice-cold lysis buffer for 4 hours (90 mM EDTA, 2.25 M NaCl, 0.7% w/v NaOH, 9 mM Tris base, 1% v/v Triton X-100, 10% v/v DMSO; pH = 10). Then, the slides were neutralized and electrophoresed on ice under the alkaline conditions (1 mM EDTA, 300 mM NaOH; pH ≥ 13) at 0.30 A for 45 minutes. At the next stage, the microgels were neutralized, stained, and pictured with neutral Tris-buffer, ethidium bromide, and fluorescent microscope, respectively. DNA fragmentation was scored using Tritek CometScore13
 <sup>TM</sup> software, and ([tail DNA/(head DNA + tail DNA)]×100) equation was applied for the tail DNA% determining. CIC
 <sub>50</sub> is the sample concentration, which protects 50% genomic DNA from fragmentation using the scatter plot equation [
