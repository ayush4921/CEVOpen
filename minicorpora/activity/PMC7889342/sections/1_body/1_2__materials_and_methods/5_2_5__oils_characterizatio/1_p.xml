<p>An HP-6890 series gas chromatography system was used for the 
 <italic>T. daenensis</italic> oil analyses. This Agilent instrument was equipped with an HP-5 capillary column packed with 5% phenyl, and also 95% methylpolysiloxane (30 m × 0.32 mm ×  0.25 
 <italic>μ</italic>m capillary dimensions), and a flame ionization detector (FID). Nitrogen was applied as the carrier, and this gas flow was set on 1 ml/min. The column oven temperature was accurately set for 3 minutes at 60°C, and after that progressively increased to 250°C for 65 minutes. The injection port and the flame ionization detector were heated to 255 and 290°C, respectively. The sample split ratio was 1 : 10 [
