<p>Fresh aerial parts of ecotypic 
 <italic>Thymus daenensis</italic> Celak were collected from their habitation in Ghazvin, Isfahan, Markazi, Lorestan, and Zanjan provinces. After that was the identification of species; they were harvested from the proposed areas randomly, and the shades dried for two weeks at ambient temperature (20–25°C). As a part of an ecotypic morphology study, the fresh plant ecotypes macroscopic diameters were measured, and also images were recorded with a digital camera (COOLPIX P510, Nikon, Japan) equipped with GPS. Voucher specimens were recognized and deposited at the Herbarium of Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Zanjan University of Medical Sciences, Zanjan, Iran. The plants were subjected to hydrodistillation using a modified Clevenger's apparatus at 100°C for 3 hours. During the hydrodistillation process, plant materials were placed in boiling water. Essential oils could be easily separated from the collecting tube water phase. Anhydrous sodium sulfate was used as drying agent. The oils were stored in the opaque air-tight sealed bottles at 4°C for 3 months, until the time of physicochemical and biological tests running [
