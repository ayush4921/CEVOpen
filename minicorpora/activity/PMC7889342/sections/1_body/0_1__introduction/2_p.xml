 <italic>T. daenensis</italic> subsp.

 <italic>Thymus</italic> is an aromatic plant that contains monoterpenoid essential oils in its leaves and floral parts, similar to most species of the Lamiaceae. Previous research has also focused on the EO-mediated biomedical activities of other species of 
 <italic>Thymus</italic> including antimicrobial, antioxidant, and also to less extent their antigenotoxic effects [
