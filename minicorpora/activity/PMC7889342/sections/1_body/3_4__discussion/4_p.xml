<p>Although 
 <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> was more sensitive to the oils cytostatic effect (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), but the 
 <italic>T. daenensis</italic> ecotypes indicated similar fungicidal effect on both fungi strains (
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05). Based on the MIC data, the differences between the oils' cytostatic effects on the 
 <italic>Aspergillus Niger</italic> were not statistically significant (
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05). However, MFC data indicated that TD9 had less fungicidal effects in comparison with the other ecotypes (
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05). TD2 and TD1 were the less bioactive agents against 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), while TD4 and TD5 presented the most antifungal effects against 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). Consistent with many publications, variations in the fungicidal effects were not consistent with the ecotypic oils phenolic contents; for example, TD1 with high thymol and carvacrol (68%) content presented a similar and even less antifungal activity compared to the TD2, TD7, TD8, and TD9 [
