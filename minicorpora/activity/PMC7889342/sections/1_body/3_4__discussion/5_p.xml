<p>Large natural polyphenols are ordered from simple to complex molecules according to the phenol rings and structural ingredients number and arrangement [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. They act as antioxidant agents by donating hydrogen from their phenolic hydroxyl groups in the food industry. It is believed that the hydroxyl moieties number, position, and the degrees of glycosylation, esterification, and polymerization would determine the polyphenol components' antioxidant activity. According to many researches, thymol and carvacrol are the most effective constituents in lipid peroxidation. A survey conducted on the different 
 <italic>Thymus</italic> species has presented that the effective antioxidant derivatives' order is as follows: thymol &gt; carvacrol &gt; terpinene &gt; myrcene &gt; linalool &gt; cymene &gt; limonene &gt; cineole &gt; pinene [

 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. DPPH radical scavenging activity and 
 <italic>β</italic>-carotene supplementation results also revealed that the 
 <italic>T. daenensis</italic> ecotypes exhibited dose-dependent antioxidants scavenging properties, acting as free radical terminators. TD2 represented the highest SC
 <sub>50</sub> and BIC
 <sub>50</sub> value, due to the fact that it contains the least effective phenolic antioxidants percent. Although some researchers reported that phenolic compounds' high concentrations might induce DNA single/double strand breaks, this study's results indicated that the 
 <italic>T. daenensis</italic> oil thymol and carvacrol contents could act as oxidative DNA damage effective inhibitors [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In this regard, TD10 were the best antigenotoxic extracts and TD2 with the lowest phenolic compounds level represented the least DNA protection ability.
