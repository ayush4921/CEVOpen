<p>Natural plant products were the most of the medicinal agent source traditionally and were used in order to provide enthusiasm for industrial drug discovery. 
 <italic>Thymus</italic> genera are famous in folk medicine. The ecotypes of 
 <italic>T. daenensis</italic> essential oils compositions have been evaluated, and approximately 62 constituents were identified in order to form 95–100% of the total volatile oil spectra, generally. Thymol and carvacrol were the main constituents with average amounts of 45.5% and 16.5%, respectively. 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> indicates that the oxygenated compounds (&gt;80%) are more dominant in comparison with the hydrocarbon constituents (&lt;20%). Oxygenated monoterpenes were the most abundant (60–84%) consisting of carvacrol, linalool, terpineol, and thymol. Monoterpene hydrocarbons, oxygenated sesquiterpenes, and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons were present in low amounts amongst the ecotypes.
