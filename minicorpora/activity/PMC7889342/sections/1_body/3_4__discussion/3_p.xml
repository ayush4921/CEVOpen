<p>Due to the other researches, while TD2 with the lowest phenolic (thymol and carvacrol) content, near 21%, indicated the weakest antibacterial effect in all strains, TD3, TD5, and TD10 were the most effective antibacterial oils with high phenols levels (74%, 80%, and 82%, respectively). The microorganism susceptibility to essential oil derivatives is also microorganism-dependent. As a conclusion, these phenolic components hydrophobic properties enable them to partition with the bacterial cell membrane lipids, and lead to disturbing the cell integrity, and also rendering them more permeable. Alkyl groups, hydroxyls, or aldehyde moieties would influence the phenols antimicrobial activity, possibly through interfering with cell wall enzymes and reducing the surface tension [
