0: Thymus (Lamiaceae) is famous for its pharmacological properties.
1: Thymus daenensis Celak (Avishan-e-denaee in Persian) is an endemic   Thymus species in Iran and is traditionally used for its digestive, carminative, antitussive, antispasmodic, and expectorant attributes in folk medicine.
2: Ecotypic oils were extracted and analyzed with the GC-MS. Their biological properties in terms of antimicrobial, antioxidant, and antigenotoxic activities were evaluated using the minimal inhibitory concentration, minimal bactericidal concentration, and DPPH,   -carotene, and comet assays.
3: The GC-MS results for   Thymus daenensis Celak oils revealed thymol (73.86%) and carvacrol (51.89%) as the most abundant components.
4: Due to the results, reasonable bactericidal activity values range from 0.14 to 5.00 mg/ml, and fungicidal activity ranges from 0.17 to 0.58 mg/ml.
5: The necessary oil free radical scavenging capacity (0.411.79 mg/ml), bleaching inhibitory activity (0.011.06 mg/ml), and genoprotective potential (1.047.78 mg/ml) indicated the dose-dependent activity.
6: The results suggest that   Thymus daenensis is an important antibacterial and antifungal bioresource.
7: Additionally, the antioxidant and radical scavenging capacity suggests this species has a role as a natural preservative in oxidative diseases and in the prevention of food spoilage.
