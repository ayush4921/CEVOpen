  <italic>Thymus</italic> (Lamiaceae) is famous for its pharmacological properties. 
  <italic>Thymus daenensis</italic> Celak (Avishan-e-denaee in Persian) is an endemic 
  <italic>Thymus</italic> species in Iran and is traditionally used for its digestive, carminative, antitussive, antispasmodic, and expectorant attributes in folk medicine. Ecotypic oils were extracted and analyzed with the GC-MS. Their biological properties in terms of antimicrobial, antioxidant, and antigenotoxic activities were evaluated using the minimal inhibitory concentration, minimal bactericidal concentration, and DPPH, 
  <italic>β</italic>-carotene, and comet assays. The GC-MS results for 
  <italic>Thymus daenensis</italic> Celak oils revealed thymol (73.86%) and carvacrol (51.89%) as the most abundant components. Due to the results, reasonable bactericidal activity values range from 0.14 to 5.00 mg/ml, and fungicidal activity ranges from 0.17 to 0.58 mg/ml. The necessary oil free radical scavenging capacity (0.41–1.79 mg/ml), bleaching inhibitory activity (0.01–1.06 mg/ml), and genoprotective potential (1.04–7.78 mg/ml) indicated the dose-dependent activity. The results suggest that 
  <italic>Thymus daenensis</italic> is an important antibacterial and antifungal bioresource. Additionally, the antioxidant and radical scavenging capacity suggests this species has a role as a natural preservative in oxidative diseases and in the prevention of food spoilage.
