<p>Subsequent research showed that some of the safrole derivatives were unable to inhibit cell growth, and the antiproliferative effects of these compounds were not only due to the presence of the benzodiaxol ring (

For instance a metabolite of safrole (safrole 2, 3-oxide), induced more potent genotoxic and cytotoxic effects than safrole (
