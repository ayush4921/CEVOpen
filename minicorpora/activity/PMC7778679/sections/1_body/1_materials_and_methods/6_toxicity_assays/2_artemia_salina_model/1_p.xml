<p>Brine shrimp cysts of 
 <italic>Artemia salina</italic>, for use in the conventional Artemia test, were acquired from 
 <italic>Artemia salina</italic> of RN, Natal, Brazil, produced by Flagner Sores de Souza. In vitro toxicity was assessed using an 
 <italic>Artemia salina</italic> (brine shrimp) model, according to a previously described method (Parra et al
 <xref rid="cit0030">30</xref>, 2001), with some modifications. Briefly, 25 mg of 
 <italic>A. salina</italic> cysts was incubated for 24 h in artificial saline water consisting of 23 g of NaCl, 11 g of MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>.6H
 <sub>2</sub>O, 4 g of Na
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>, 1.3 g of CaCl
 <sub>2</sub>.H
 <sub>2</sub>O, and 0.7 g of KCl dissolved in 1000 mL of distilled water. An oxygen pump was placed in the saline water and a light was coupled on top of the container to keep the temperature at 25Â°C during the experiment. After 24 h of incubation, the nauplii were fed with 0.6 g of 
 <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and incubated for another 24 h.
