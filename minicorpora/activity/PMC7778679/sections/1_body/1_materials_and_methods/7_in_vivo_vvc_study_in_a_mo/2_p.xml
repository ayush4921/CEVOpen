<p>Female C57BL/6 mice (n = 56) at 8–10 weeks of age, weighing 20–25 g, were used for these experiments. For environmental adaptation, the animals remained in the experimental room for 4 weeks before starting the assay. During the entire experiment, the animals were kept in polypropylene boxes (50 × 30 × 20 cm), maintained with adequate temperature and ventilation and an alternating 12/12 h light/dark cycle.</p>
