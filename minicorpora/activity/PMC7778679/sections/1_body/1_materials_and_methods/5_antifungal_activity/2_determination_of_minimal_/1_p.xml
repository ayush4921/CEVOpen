<p>The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of EO and ME+EO were determined using a microplate dilution technique, according to protocol M27-A3,
 <xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> with some modifications. Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium (0.1 mL) was added to a 96-well microplate and was inoculated with 0.1 mL of a fungal suspension containing 2.5 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> colony-forming units (CFU)/mL. EO and ME+EO were tested at concentrations ranging from 7.8 to 500 µg/mL. Amphotericin B (AmB, Sigma-Aldrich) and fluconazole (Sigma-Aldrich) were used as positive controls. Culture medium, yeast growth, EO, ME+EO, ME, and solvent were used as additional (sterility) controls. Microplates were incubated at 37°C for 48 h. After incubation, 20 µL of an aqueous solution of 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride was added and the plates were incubated at 37°C for 2 h.
