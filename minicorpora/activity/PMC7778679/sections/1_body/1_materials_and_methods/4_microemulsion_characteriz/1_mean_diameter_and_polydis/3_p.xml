<p>The ME (without EO) and ME+EO were analyzed in the analysis chamber with a laser beam crossing throughout the dispersion. The system was maintained at 25Â°C, with a laser wavelength of 532 nm and the refractive index for each sample was analyzed according to the index observed. Ten determinations of the mean diameter and the polydispersity index (PDI) of droplets of each sample were performed (n = 3). This assay was performed after 24 h (T0) and 3 months (T3) of samples preparation in order to verify stability of formulations and possible alterations in particle diameter.</p>
