<p>A TA.XTplus texture analyzer (Stable Micro Systems, Surrey, UK) was used, in the adhesion test mode, to evaluate the detachment force between porcine vaginal mucosa and the formulations tested (ME; ME+EO). Two mm thickness of porcine vaginal mucosa was fixed to the cylindrical probe (10 mm diameter) of the equipment. The temperature during the analyses was controlled at 37 ± 0.5°C. ME or ME+EO samples were added to small containers below the probe (same direction). The probe was lowered (constant rate, 1 mm/s) until the mucosa had direct contact (60 s) with the formulations (ME; ME+EO), without force employed during this period.</p>
