 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3</xref> shows the elastic modulus (G′) and viscous modulus (G″) of the formulations. The ME and ME+EO showed elastic behavior (G′ &gt; G″), indicating a highly organized structure. These results demonstrated that the incorporation of EO in the system did not alter the viscoelastic behavior of the formulations. Viscoelasticity is important for vaginal application, due to the ease of administration and suitable scattering in the vaginal environment.
