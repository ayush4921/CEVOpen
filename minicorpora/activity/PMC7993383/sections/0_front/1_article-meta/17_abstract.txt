0: AbstractIsolation and identification of natural products from plants is an essential approach for discovering drug candidates.
1: Herein we report the characterization of three sesquiterpene lactones from a new genus   Shangwua, e.g.
2: onopordopicrin (ONP), C  2, and C  3, and evaluation of their pharmacological functions in interfering cellular redox signaling.
3: Compared to C  2 and C  3, ONP shows the most potency in killing cancer cells.
4: Further experiments demonstrate that ONP robustly inhibits thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), which leads to perturbation of cellular redox homeostasis with the favor of oxidative stress.
5: Knockdown of the TrxR sensitizes cells to the ONP treatment while overexpression of the enzyme reduces the potency of ONP, underpinning the correlation of TrxR inhibition to the cytotoxicity of ONP.
6: The discovery of ONP expands the library of the natural TrxR inhibitors, and the disclosure of the action mechanism of ONP provides a foundation for the further development of ONP as an anticancer agent.
