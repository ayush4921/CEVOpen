<p>For statistical evaluation, R 2.11.1 software package (2010) was applied. Statistical significance of differences was assessed with one-sample Studentâ€™s 
 <italic>t</italic>-tests for assessment of relative values. Differences between absolute means were evaluated by one-way analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA) with post hoc Tukey test, where data were of normal distribution and homogeneity of variances was confirmed. Differences were considered significant if the 
 <italic>p</italic> values was &lt;.05 marked with * (***
 <italic>p</italic>&lt;.001).
