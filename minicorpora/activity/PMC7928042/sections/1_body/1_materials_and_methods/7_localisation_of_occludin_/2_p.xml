<p>To quantify the occludin concentrations in HIEC-6 and PHH, human occludin sandwich ELISA kits were used (Elabscience, Central European Biosystems, Budapest, Hungary). HIEC-6 and PHH were incubated with inhibitors MI-1900 and MI-1907 at 50 µM for 24 h. The cells were dissociated with 0.25% trypsin solution and the cell suspension were collected and centrifuged for 5 min at 1000×
