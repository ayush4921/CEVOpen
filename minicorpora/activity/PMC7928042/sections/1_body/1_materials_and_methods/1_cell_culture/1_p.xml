<p>The human intestinal epithelial cell line, HIEC-6 (ATCC, Manassas, VA) was grown in 50% Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) and 50% Ham’s F12 Nutrient Mixture (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) supplemented with 1.5 mmol/L HEPES, 1% insulin/transferrin/sodium selenite media supplement, 5 ng/mL epidermal growth factor, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (all purchased from Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Cells were cultured on 96-well-plates for MTS assay and on 24-well transwell inserts (polyester, 0.4 µm pore size, Corning, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) for the other procedures at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. The complete culture medium was changed every two days until the cells reached the confluent condition.
