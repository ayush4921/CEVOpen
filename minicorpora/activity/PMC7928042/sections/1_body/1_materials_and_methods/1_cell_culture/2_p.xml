<p>Cryopreserved human primary hepatocytes were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA). Hepatocytes were seeded on membrane insert plates (Costar Transwell permeable supports, 0.4 µm polyester membrane 24 mm insert, six-well plate, tissue culture treated, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and on a 96-well plate (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) for MTS assay. The seeding density was 0.9–1.1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/mL, in 2 mL apical medium. The maintenance medium was Williams E medium, supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mM glutamine, 0.2 IU/mL insulin, and 0.22% bicarbonate (all purchased from Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Foetal bovine serum (FBS) 10% was added to the medium only in the first 6 h after thawing. The maintenance medium without FBS was then used and replaced every 24 h. The cells were incubated at 37 °C, with 5% CO
