<p>The assay is based on the ability of living cells to reduce the MTS tetrazolium compound to a coloured formazan product soluble in the cell culture medium. The reduction is carried out by an NAD(P)H-dependent dehydrogenase in metabolically active cells. The HIEC-6 and the hepatocytes were placed onto 96-well-plates and incubated for 24 h with the inhibitors at 5, 20, 50, and 100 µM concentrations. The MTS assay was performed with eight parallels at each inhibitor concentration. After removing the medium and three times washing of the cells with PBS, 20 µL of CellTiter96 Aqueous One Solution (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI) containing MTS and an electron acceptor reagent, phenazine ethosulfate, were pipetted into a 96-well plate, each containing 100 µL of phenol red free medium. The plate was incubated for 1.5 h in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator. The viability of HIEC-6 was detected with an EZ Read Biochrom 400 microplate reader (Biochrom, Cambridge, UK) at 490 nm.
