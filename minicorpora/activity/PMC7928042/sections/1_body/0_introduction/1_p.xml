<p>There are approximately 70 different trypsin-like serine proteases in humans, which fulfil manifold physiological functions. Dysregulated activities of these proteases contribute to the development of numerous diseases, like thrombotic and bleeding disorders, cancer, iron metabolic diseases, pancreatitis, or osteoarthritis

Despite these potential applications for drug development, so far, a broad application was only achieved with synthetic inhibitors of the blood clotting proteases thrombin and factor Xa have been approved for use as anticoagulants. A relatively non-specific scaffold of numerous trypsin-like serine protease inhibitors comprises tertiary amides of arylsulfonylated 3-amidinophenylalanines (Phe(3-Am)), like tosyl-Phe(3-Am)-piperidide (TAPAP)
