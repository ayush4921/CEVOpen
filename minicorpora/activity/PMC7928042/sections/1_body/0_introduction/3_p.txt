0: Coronaviruses have evolved multiple strategies for proteolytic activation of the S-protein and depending on the virus strains, various host proteases like the trypsin-like serine protease TMPRSS2 or furin are involved.
1: It has been proven that TMPRSS2 as a host cell factor is critical for the infectivity of several clinically relevant viruses including coronaviruses 1823.
2: Tarnow et al.
3: 24 reported that H1N1 and H7N9 influenza virus replication was significantly suppressed in airway explants in TMPRSS2 deficient mice; however, knockout of TMPRSS2 expression in mice only exerted a minor effect on H3N2 virus replication.
4: Therefore, additional trypsin-like serine proteases seem to be involved in the activation of H3N2 influenza A as well as influenza B viruses 25.
