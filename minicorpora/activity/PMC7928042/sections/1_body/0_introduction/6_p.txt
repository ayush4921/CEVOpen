0: The human intestinal epithelial cell line-6 (HIEC-6) is a non-tumourigenic intestinal epithelial crypt cell line 27 located in the small intestine.
1: Epithelial cells play a major role in absorption and secretion processes in the gastrointestinal tract, as well as in protection from pathogens and xenobiotics via their intestinal barrier 28.
2: Therefore, intestinal epithelial cells (primary or cell lines) can be appropriate models for studying the pharmacokinetical effects of xenobiotics  in vitro.
3: The human colon adenocarcinoma cell line-2 (Caco-2) is a tumourigenic intestinal cell line, which is widely used for investigations of drug transport and paracellular effects 29, although cancerous characteristics of Caco-2 limit its suitability for modelling physiological  in vivo conditions.
