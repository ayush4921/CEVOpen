0: There are approximately 70 different trypsin-like serine proteases in humans, which fulfil manifold physiological functions.
1: Dysregulated activities of these proteases contribute to the development of numerous diseases, like thrombotic and bleeding disorders, cancer, iron metabolic diseases, pancreatitis, or osteoarthritis 19.
2: Despite these potential applications for drug development, so far, a broad application was only achieved with synthetic inhibitors of the blood clotting proteases thrombin and factor Xa have been approved for use as anticoagulants.
3: A relatively non-specific scaffold of numerous trypsin-like serine protease inhibitors comprises tertiary amides of arylsulfonylated 3-amidinophenylalanines (Phe(3-Am)), like tosyl-Phe(3-Am)-piperidide (TAPAP) 10.
4: Mesupron, a structurally closely related hydroxyamidino-prodrug of the urokinase-type plasminogen activator inhibitor WX-UK1 11 reached phase II development for cancer therapy.
5: Several derivatives of this scaffold have been developed as inhibitors of other trypsin-like serine proteases including type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs) like matriptase 12,13.
6: Related TTSPs, like transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) or human airway trypsin-like protease (HAT), and differentially expressed in squamous cell carcinoma-1 (DESC1) protein can also activate surface glycoproteins of different viruses, e.g.
7: certain influenza viruses 14.
8: This activation step is essential for the fusion competence of these viruses and therefore a prerequisite for their replication and spread.
9: TMPRSS2 is also involved in the activation of the spike (S) surface protein of various coronaviruses, including the new SARS-CoV-2 15,16, as well as the activation of fusion proteins of several other respiratory viruses, e.g.
10: human metapneumovirus or human parainfluenza viruses 14,17.
