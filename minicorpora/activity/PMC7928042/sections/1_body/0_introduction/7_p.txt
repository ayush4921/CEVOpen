0: In this study, sulfonylated Phe(3-Am)-derived inhibitors of trypsin-like serine proteases were applied on a non-tumourigenic human intestinal epithelial cell line, HIEC-6 and on primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) to estimate the safety of these potential antiviral agents  in vitro.
1: Cell viability assays were performed to determine non-cytotoxic concentrations of these inhibitors.
2: Furthermore, redox balance and inflammatory status including production of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 of the cells exposed to the inhibitors, MI-1900 and MI-1907 were elucidated in addition to assessment of subcellular distribution and quantity of the tight-junction (TJ) protein, occludin after inhibitor treatment.
3: Furthermore, using a homology model of TMPRSS2, the binding mode of inhibitors MI-1900 and MI-1907 in complex with TMPRSS2 was modelled.
