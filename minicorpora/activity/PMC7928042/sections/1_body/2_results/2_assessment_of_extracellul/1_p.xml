<p>To quantify the H

 <sub>2</sub> production, cells were incubated with the inhibitors MI-1900 and MI-1907 at the largest measured non-cytotoxic (50 µM) concentration for 24 h. After the treatment, cell free supernatants were taken from the basolateral compartment into a 96-well plate and were mixed with the Amplex Red working solution followed by the measurement of the fluorescence intensities. The results show that none of the inhibitors significantly increased the production of the extracellular hydrogen peroxide at the applied concentration (
