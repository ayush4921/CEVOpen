<p>The MTS assay was used to assess the viability of the HIEC-6 and PHH 24 h after inhibitor treatment. The cells were incubated with each inhibitor at different concentrations such as 5, 20, 50, and 100 µM. The cell viability assay showed that MI-463 and MI-482 treatments elevated HIEC-6 cell death rate at 50 µM and 100 µM (
 <italic>p</italic>&lt;.001 in case of MI-463 and 
 <italic>p</italic>&lt;.01 and 
 <italic>p</italic>&lt;.001 in case of MI-482, respectively). In addition, MI-1907 also decreased the cell viability of HIEC-6 but only at 100 µM (
 <italic>p</italic>&lt;.05). However, MI-1900 did not appear to be cytotoxic at any applied concentration after 24 h treatment (
