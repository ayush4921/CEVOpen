<p>Both compounds adopt a Y-shape conformation typical for such Phe(3-Am)-derived inhibitors in complex with trypsin-like serine proteases. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0007">Figure 7(A,B)</xref>, the Phe(3-Am) core is deeply bound into the S1 pocket, the biphenylâ€™s terminal phenyl ring occupies the S3/4 binding pocket above Trp215 and is surrounded by the basic side chain of residue Lys99.
