<p>Since numerous crystal structures of Phe(3-Am)-derived inhibitors in complex with other trypsin-like serine proteases have been determined in the past, the general binding mode of such inhibitors is well established. Accordingly, known key interactions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0007">Figures 7</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0008">8</xref>) were taken into account in the creation of the modelled inhibitors MI-1900 and MI-1907 in complex with TMPRSS2.
