<p>In conclusion, structurally related inhibitors of trypsin-like serine proteases were tested in HIEC-6 and PHH to determine their 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> safety. Recently, in case of MI-1900 an anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect could be demonstrated in Calu-3 cells inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 at a low MOI of 0.001 based on viral titres in cell supernatants. It was also demonstrated that two of the selected Phe(3-Am)-derived inhibitors can be applied safely at concentrations up to 50 µM without affecting occludin localisation pattern and perturbing the regulation of investigated cytokines such as IL-6 and Il-8 levels.
