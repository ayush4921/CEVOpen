<p>In our study, the non-cytotoxic concentrations of inhibitors MI-1900 and MI-1907 were determined. It was proven that MI-1900 could be safely administered at concentrations up to 100 µM and had no significant effect on of cell viability of HIEC-6 after 24 h treatment period. MI-1900 and MI-1907 can be tolerated up to 50 µM in PHH similarly to HIEC-6. Even though the primary cell cultures such as PHH have a disadvantage of shorter lifespan and limited availability, these cultures are more likely better suited for pharmacological and toxicological researches because of their greater sensitivity, compared to cell lines, e.g. HepG2 or HeraRG. Hepatic enzyme induction as one of the most essential parameters for pharmacokinetic research is significantly greater in primary hepatocytes than hepatic cell lines
