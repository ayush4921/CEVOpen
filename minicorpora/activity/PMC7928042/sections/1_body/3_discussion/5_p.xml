<p>Loss of matriptase resulted in reduction of TER in intestinal tissue segment of suppression of tumourigenicity (
 <italic>St14</italic>) hypomorphic mice and in Caco-2 cells treated with the broad-spectrum serine protease inhibitor, AEBSF or the selective synthetic matriptase inhibitor CVS-3983. Blocked matriptase activity can influence physiological turnover of tight junctional claudin-2 protein responsible for decreasing the tightness of epithelial barriers. Supportive matriptase-based intestinal barrier recovery can be one of the strategic options in the prevention and in the treatment of intestinal bowel diseases with weakened barrier integrity
