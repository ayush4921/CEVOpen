<p>It was previously reported that various mono-, di-, and tribasic Phe(3-Am)-derived inhibitors of trypsin-like serine proteases could effectively reduce the infectivity of certain influenza A viruses in Calu-3, in MDCK or in HEK293 cells

 </xref>. In these studies, MI-1900 exerted a stronger inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication at 50 µM with 25–70-fold reduced virus titres compared to MI-432, which provided an approximately 14-fold decrease in virus titres. At present, it is difficult to define the most promising inhibitor of the Phe(3-Am)-type, because different trypsin-like serine proteases are involved in the glycoprotein activation of various enveloped viruses. However, compared to the tribasic or dibasic analogues, a less polar monobasic Phe(3-Am)-derived inhibitor MI-1900 might be advantageous compound for further studies due to its improved bioavailability. Furthermore, our data suggest that inhibitor MI-1900 could be a safely applicable drug candidate against certain influenza virus strains and SARS-CoV-2.
