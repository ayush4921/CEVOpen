<p>Cytotoxicity of few Phe(3-Am)-derived inhibitors has been previously investigated. CU-1804 and CU-1807 (10 µM, 48 h) did not affect viability of human pancreatic adenocarcinoma AsPC-1 cells. The inhibitors MI-432 and MI-462 at 50 µM neither exerted cytotoxic effects on Calu-3 cells during 48 h exposure time
