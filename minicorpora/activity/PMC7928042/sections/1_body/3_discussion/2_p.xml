<p>Serine protease activities seem to play a fundamental role in the maintenance and functioning of epithelial barrier homeostasis. It was reported that administration of trypsin and human neutrophil elastase led to increased transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) of confluent layers of airway and alveolar cells and consequently reduced paracellular ion conductance suggesting the physiological role of serine protease in fluid management across lung epithelium
