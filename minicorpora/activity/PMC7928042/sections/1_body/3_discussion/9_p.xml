<p>In our study, occludin mapping revealed that distribution pattern and amount of occludin remained the same in HIEC-6 exposed to inhibitors MI-1900 and MI-1907 at 50 µM for 24 h. In contrast, occludin relocalisation was detected in IPEC-J2 cells after treatment with inhibitor MI-432 at 50 µM. Exposure of IPEC-J2 cells to MI-432 and to a second analogue MI-460 revealed that these inhibitors could cause a significant decrease in matriptase activity, which also led to significant reduction of the TER and an enhancement in transport of fluorescently labelled dextran molecules in addition to cellular redistribution of occludin
