  <p>Model of inhibitor MI-1900 (pale blue carbon atoms) in complex with TMPRSS2. (A) View of the inhibitor embedded into the active site of TMPRSS2 shown with a transparent surface. The residues of the catalytic triad (Ser195, His57, Asp102, residue numbers are based on the chymotrypsinogen numbering) are depicted with green carbon atoms, important residues of the active site involved in polar contacts to the inhibitor are shown with yellow carbon atoms. Lys99 is oriented towards the biphenyl’s terminal ring and might form a cation–π interaction. (B) Close view on the active site interactions. The amidino group forms strong ionic interactions with Asp189 at the bottom of the S1 pocket and polar interactions with the surrounding residues Ser190 and Gly219. Furthermore, the sulfonylated backbone makes an antiparallel beta sheet interaction with Gly216 and binds to the NH of Gly219.</p>
