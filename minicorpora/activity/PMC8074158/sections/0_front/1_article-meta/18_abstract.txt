0: Essential oils obtained by hydrodistillation of   Montanoa quadrangularis leaves, flowers, and stems were analyzed by GC and GC/MS techniques revealing myrcene, limonene, -phellandrene, and sabinene among the main components.
1: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the MDR modulator activity on human MDR1 gene transfected mouse lymphoma cell line and the antimicrobial activity on the essential oils obtained from different parts of the species under investigation.
2: The results revealed that MQL caused a similar increase in the fluorescence activity of the cells at 0.02 L/mL comparing to the Verapamil   value.
3: The antimicrobial assay was carried out according to the disc diffusion method.
4: Five different bacterial strains (  Staphylococcus epidermidis,   Bacillus subtilis,   Pseudomonas aeruginosa,   Escherichia coli AG 100, and   Escherichia coli AG100  A) were treated with the essential oils and the zones of inhibition were determined on TSA plates and TSA agar plates supplemented with Tween 20.
5: MQF and MQL showed activity against   B. subtilis,   S. epidermidis, and   E. coli AG 100  A while MQS was only active against   E. coli AG 100  A on TSA agar plates experiment.
6: In case of TSA agar plates supplemented with 0.1   v/  v% Tween 20 detergent, MQF showed inhibition on   B. subtilis,   S. epidermidis, and   E. coli AG 100  A; MQL was active against   B. subtilis,   E. coli AG 100,   and E. coli AG 100  A while MQS was only active against   E. coli AG 100  A.
