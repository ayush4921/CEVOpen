The work tried to solve bioavailability issues of that antimigraine active pharmaceutical ingredient. From the biopolymers screened, alginate was selected to produce a nanoemulsion of sumatriptan with the oil. The nanoemulsions displayed high entrapment efficiency in the range of 69 to 41%, high stability during at least for one year, and improved kinetic release compared to free drug. Also, tests on zebrafish larvae did not show changes in behavior either in their morphology.
