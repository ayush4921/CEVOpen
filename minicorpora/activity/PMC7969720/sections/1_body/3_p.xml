The article “Trypanosomatid-caused conditions: State of the art of therapeutics and potential applications of lipid-based nanocarriers” concludes that lipid nanocarriers could improve the efficacy–safety balance of known treatments, diminishing cytotoxicity and organ toxicity, especially in the case of leishmaniasis. However, it also underlines that last generation systems are still to be widely explored in the field of neglected conditions.
