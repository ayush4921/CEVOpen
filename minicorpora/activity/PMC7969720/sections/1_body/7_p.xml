<p>In the work entitled “
 <italic>In silico</italic> and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> evaluation of mimetic peptides as potential antigen candidates for prophylaxis of leishmaniasis,” 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fchem.2020.601409" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Guedes et al.</ext-link> performed the liposomal encapsulation of synthetic peptides with antigenic activity against 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic> spp. Six peptides obtained from 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic> spp. membranes and histones were synthetized by the phage display technique. The entrapped peptide was administered to New Zealand rabbits and used to determine humoral immunogenic protection against 
 <italic>L. braziliensis</italic> or 
 <italic>L. infantum</italic>. The peptide mixture triggered IFN-γ, IL-12, IL-4, and TGF-β, which induced Th1 and Th2 cellular immune response by polarization of T CD4
 <sup>+</sup> cells and high expression of iNOS in infected rabbits. These promissory results will be extended for the treatment of other pathologies and imply a new approach for the development of novel type of vaccines.
