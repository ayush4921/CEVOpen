  <bold>Lipid Nanoparticles as a Novel Strategy to Deliver Bioactive Molecules</bold>
 </ext-link>Lipid nanoparticles are so far among the most successful nanodelivery systems, considering the significant proportion of marketed nanocarriers that correspond to this category. High loading capacity, biocompatibility, and environmentally friendly obtention techniques can be mentioned among their most prominent specific advantages. The current research topic on 
 <italic>Lipid Nanoparticles as a Novel Strategy to Deliver Bioactive Molecules</italic> encompasses original and review articles on a wide range of lipid nanoparticle-related topics, from encapsulation of gene therapies to novel characterization approaches. The collection of articles also expresses the increasing versatility of these nanosystems, owing to the use of hybrid and functionalized carriers.
