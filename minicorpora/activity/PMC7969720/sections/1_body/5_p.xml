A hybrid platform used for the intracellular delivery of TNF-α siRNA was the lipid-like transfection agent lipidoid L5 and poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) successfully assayed in lipopolysaccharide-activated murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7. Importantly, kinetic release of fluorescent siRNA from LPNs

 <italic>in vivo</italic> demonstrated not only sustained release of siRNA from the nanoparticles but also a correlation between cell uptake and

They also highlight a diversity of immunotherapeutic approaches through mRNA delivery and discuss the main factors affecting
