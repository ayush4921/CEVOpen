 <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">Aftab et al., (2020)</xref> identified RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) as a novel COVID-19 drug target, which controls viral replication, acting as a possible therapeutic target to prevent viral infection. The viral 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLpro) enzyme regulates coronavirus replication and is necessary for its life-cycle. 3CLpro is a proven drug development target for extreme acute respiratory coronavirus syndrome (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory coronavirus syndrome (MERS-CoV) (
