<p id="p0315">The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp also named nsp12) is the transcription machinery and vital part of corona viral replication and it appears to be a main target for the antiviral drug. The 3D structure of RdRp is cryo-electron microscopy structure and full-length nsp12 in complex with a resolution of 2.9A° and cofactors of nsp7 and nsp8. In addition to the conserved design of the polymerase center of the viral polymerase family, nsp12 has a recently recognized β-hairpin domain at its N terminus. a similar analysis of the model shows how drug compounds binds to the polymerase. This RdRp viral structure provides a basis for the design of new antiviral therapies (
