<p id="p0135">Khalid Bin Saad (R.A.) narrates, “I came to Madinah with Ghalib Bin Al Jabr. Ghalib became ill during the journey. Ibn Abi Ateeq came to see him and told a narration from Hazrat Aisha (R.A.) that the Prophet Muhammad (SAW) told about the cure in Kalonji. We crushed a few seeds of Kalonji and mixed it with olive oil and dropped in both nostrils, after which Ghalib became healthy”.</p>
