<p>It is also noteworthy to mention that studies regarding herbal medicines should be taken into more consideration because the safety and efficacy of many herbal medicines are still unclear. Also, additional reliable trials are essential to evaluate the safety and efficacy of different constituents of rosemary in treating different nervous system disorders. Furthermore, the probable mechanisms of action and the potential antagonistic and synergistic properties of multi-component mixtures of rosemary need to be examined by the integration of physiological, pharmacological, bioavailability-centered, and pharmacokinetic methods. Prolonged and high dose usage of traditional formulations of rosemary and its active constituents should be avoided until more profound toxicity investigations become available. The new findings may expand the present therapeutic importance of rosemary and develop its future use in modern medicine. </p>
