<p>Previous studies reported that 54% of hemodialysis patients suffer from pain (

 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>). So, rosemary induces its analgesic properties by affecting different antinociceptive pathways. But further detailed investigations are essential to determine the exact involved mechanisms through which rosemary exhibits its antinociceptive activities such as the number of inflammatory cells, apoptotic and microglial activation markers or the probable direct effect of rosemary on muscles.
