<p>It is also believed that prolong the existence of acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft might cause cholinergic function in Alzheimer’s disease due to inhibition of acetylcholine hydrolysis (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). It is proposed that cholinergic neurons degenerate in the basal forebrain and it is associated with loss of cholinergic neurotransmission in the cerebral part of the cortex. This might be therapeutically important because the cholinergic system of basal forebrain is involved in the attention and cognitive processing of memory (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). There are two major forms of cholinesterases in the human brain: butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) and acethylcholinesterase (AChE). In the human brain, both of them are found in neurons, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, tangles in Alzheimer’s disease and neuritic plaques (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). It is reported that AChE activity reduced in the cortex but BuChE activity increased or remained unchanged during Alzheimer’s disease development (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). A group of researchers assessed the influence of sub- chronic administration of rosemary extract (200 mg/kg, PO) on cognitive activities and behavior of rats and to evaluated BuChE and AChE gene expression level and activity in frontal cortex and hippocampus. It was observed that rosemary extract alleviated long-term memory and inhibited the AChE activity. It also had a stimulatory effect on BuChE in both parts of the rat brain. In addition, it reduced BuChE expression in cortex and increased it in the hippocampus (
