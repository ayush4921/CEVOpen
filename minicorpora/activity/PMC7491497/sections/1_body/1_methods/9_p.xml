<p>The number of elderly adults, over 65 years old, worldwide is supposed to be doubled by the year 2030 and to help individuals stay in the workforce longer, the need to stay cognitively fit is improving. Thus, the development of natural interventions to slow or prevent cognitive decline naturally associated with aging is crucial. Herbal ingredients and nutrients have been studied as a probable solution to this developing concern. One of the important hallmarks of the aging process is oxidative damage (
