<p>Emotional disorders, such as anxiety, cause a huge burden on health all around the world. Documents suggest that stress might lead to the loss of neuronal cells, atrophy and reduce the volume of key structures in the brain. Long-term exposure to stress may induce neuronal degeneration, neuronal inflammation and brain microdamage (
 <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>). Chronic stress occurs because of high glucocorticoids level and hyperactivity of hypothalamus- pituitary-adrenal axis that triggers several physiological adaptive feedback regulatory mechanisms (
 <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>). Furthermore, some documents have displayed that stress stimulates ACh release in a brain region-specific method (

 <italic>R. officinalis</italic> contains polyphenols such as rosmarinic acid, luteolin, carnosic acid, and other components that possess several effects on psychiatric disorders or neurological functions such as anti- depressive and anti-anxiety properties and neuroprotective and cognitive effects (

 <xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>,
 <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>). It has also been reported that rosemary essential oil exhibited improved mood and cognition in healthy adults (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). The inhalation of rosemary essential oil as an anti-stress (
 <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>) and anxiolytic (
 <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>-
 <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>) therapy has fewer side effects (
 <xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>). The detailed mechanisms and effectiveness of this essential oil on neurological and psychological function is not well-understood. In a recent study, the effect of inhalation of rosemary essential oil was evaluated on the molecular mechanism that reduces stress 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> using PC12 cells and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> using mice. The results showed that inhalation of rosemary essential oil decreased stress by reducing serum corticosterone level and increased brain dopamine level 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Thus, this essential oil might modulate the activities of the sympathetic nervous system and hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis. In addition, it has been reported that rosemary essential oil regulates brain neurotransmitter activity and demonstrates neurophysiological effect related to acetylcholine synthesis and release, as well as inducing neuronal differentiation in mice (
 <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>). Moreover, 
 <italic>R. officinalis </italic>L. has been claimed to activate cholinergic activity (AChE activity) in PC12 cells via phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (
 <xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>). More investigations might be useful to examine the validity of these results in clinical trials. The results also reinforce that rosemary essential oil has potential properties to be used as a safe alternative treatment method for stress-related mood disorders.
