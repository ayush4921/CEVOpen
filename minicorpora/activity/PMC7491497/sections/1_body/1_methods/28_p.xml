<p>Diabetes mellitus could also cause neuronal tissue damage in the central and peripheral nervous system. A study have reported that more than one-half of diabetic patients suffer from diabetic neuropathy and pain due to diabetes neuropathy (
 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>). In diabetic patients, hyperglycemia is reported to be the main underlying factor of injury to the nervous system (
 <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>). Some previous results have led to the proposal that diabetic neuropathy might occur because of constant production of reactive oxygen species through glucose auto-oxidation and development of glycation end-products, activation of nuclear enzyme Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), and reduction of anti-oxidant protection (
 <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>). Moreover, apoptosis has been reported to be another probable mechanism for the high glucose-induced neural disorder and cell death (
 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>). The neuroprotective and anti-hyperalgesic effects of rosemary extract (100, 150, or 200 mg/kg, PO) in a rat model of streptozotocin-induced diabetes were studied for 21 days. It was observed that treating with rosemary extract improved hyperalgesia, hyperglycemia, and motor deficit, decreased caspase-3 activation and Bax: Bcl-2 ratio (

In another study it was also concluded that different rosemary extracts and its main phenolic components exert advantageous properties against diabetes and metabolic syndrome through increasing insulin secretion and response, inhibition of advanced glycation end products generation, suppression of gluconeogenesis, anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti- hyperlipidemic properties. These magnificent effects are systematically related to enzyme modulation, transcription factors, various vital signal transduction pathways, and important gene expressions (
 <xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>). Although there are several documents which examined the neuroprotective and analgesic effects of rosemary extracts in animal studies and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> investigations, more clinical assessments are essential to support the safety and potency of the phenolic agents of rosemary in humans. Hence, it can be finalized that rosemary extract has anti-hyperalgesic and neuroprotective properties in diabetes.
