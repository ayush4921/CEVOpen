<p>Abdelhalim and colleagues, 2015, studied the effects of non-volatile constituents of rosemary including cirsimaritin, rosmanol, and salvigenin (50-200 mg/kg) on the central nervous system function. These components show biphasic modulation of GABAA receptors and demonstrated CNS activity in mouse models of antinociception (
