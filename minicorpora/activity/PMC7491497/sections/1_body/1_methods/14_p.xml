<p>Alzheimer’s disease is a complicated disease which implicates interaction between genetic and environmental risk factors and it is characterized by tau tangles, amyloid plaques, loss of synapses and neuronal loss (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). The generation of nitrosative and oxidative stress partially damage neurons, because oligomeric amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide triggers generation of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) (

Activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1-nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like2 (Keap1/Nrf2) pathway increases the transcription of anti-inflammatory proteins and phase 2 anti-oxidant. Hence, it could be a promising therapeutic process in various neurodegenerative conditions. It has been shown that carnosic acid converts to its active form by oxidative stress and its active form stimulates the Keap1/Nrf2 transcriptional pathway and therefore, produces phase 2 anti-oxidant enzymes in both
