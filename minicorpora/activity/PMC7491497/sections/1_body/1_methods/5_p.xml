<p>The antidepressant-like effect of hydro-alcoholic extract of the leaves and stems of rosemary (100 mg/kg, PO) for 14 days was revealed in behavioral tests in mice and it was also shown that its antidepressant-like effect is dependent on its interaction with the noradrenergic (Î± 1-receptor), dopaminergic (D1 and D2 receptors) and serotonergic (5-HT1A, 5-HT2A and 5-HT3 receptors) systems (

This research group also reported that chronic administration of the hydro-alcoholic extract of rosemary (10-300 mg/kg, PO) for 14 days similar to fluoxetine (10mg/kg, PO) could reduce anhedonic-like behavior and hyperactivity that were associated with hippocampal acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in olfactory bulbectomized mice (
