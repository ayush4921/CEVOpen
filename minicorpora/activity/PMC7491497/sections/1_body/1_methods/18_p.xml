<p>Epilepsy is a neurological disease that causes periodic spontaneous seizures and memory and learning deficits (
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). Seizures lead to neuronal death because of over- activating of glutamate receptors (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). Glutamate has an important role in cognitive actions including learning and memory and in synaptic plasticity as well, but the higher concentration of glutamate and over activation of its receptor leads to neurodegeneration in the central nervous system (

Anti-oxidant components of rosemary extract (250, 500 and 750 mg/kg) reduced lipid peroxidation and interact with the free radical chain reaction and donate hydrogen and finally neutralize harmful agents in cooking liver pâté (

Another study showed that rosemary extract (100 mg/kg/day, containing 40% carnosic acid, PO, for 23 days) might improve working and spatial memory deficits and neuronal degeneration induced by the toxicity of kainic acid (9.5 mg/kg, IP) in the hippocampus of rats, which might be because of its anti-oxidant properties. Rosemary also significantly decreased both seizure severity and onset in rats. In addition, neuronal loss in the CA1 region reduced (
