<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative illness that is caused by a loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. The clinical symptoms of PD are characterized by a combination of bradykinesia, resting tremor, rigidity, and postural instability (

Carnosic acid protected against 6-hydroxydopamine-induced neurotoxicity in a rat model of Parkinson’s disease which is probably attributable to its anti-oxidative and anti- apoptotic properties. The present data might help to distinguish the possible mechanisms of rosemary in the neuroprotection of PD (
