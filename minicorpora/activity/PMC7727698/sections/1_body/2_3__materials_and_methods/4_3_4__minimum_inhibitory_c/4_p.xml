<p>In order to define the MIC the composition of the EOs and emulsions was considered. The quantities for each emulsion were determined after preliminary tests that indicated the MIC for each of the standards involved (limonene, eugenol and alfa-pinene), the values being in the rage of 2–7 µL/100 mL. For this motive the concentrations tested were 2, 5 and 7 µL/100 L. Subsequantly, these values obtained in the preliminary tests were used to calculate the necesary quantity for each essential oils, respectively emulsions, so as to contain aproximatly that specific standard concentration.</p>
