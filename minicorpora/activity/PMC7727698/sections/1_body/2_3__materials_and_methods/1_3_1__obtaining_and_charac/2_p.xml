<p>The particle sizes and their electric charge at the surface were determined using a Zetasizer instrument (Cordouan Technology, Cité de la Photonique, France). Mean particle size (nm), polydispersity index (PDI), and ζpotential (mV) were determined. The instrument consists of a size analyzer, known as the Vasco Particle Size Analyzer, and a Zeta potential analyzer, called the Wallis. For these determinations, the following measurement parameters were used: vat type (plastic, 380 to 780 nm long, visible spectrum), working temperature (23 °C), laser power (80 ± 5%), position DTC: UP, channel number (~450) and time range (15 ± 5 μs), data acquisition mode-continuous, with at least five measurements/sequence (statistical distribution) at medium resolution with Pade-Laplace analysis mode and Henry-Smoluchowski functions for the analysis of experimental data.</p>
