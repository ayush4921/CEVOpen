<p>The use of natural preparations such as emulsions and nanoemulsions represents a viable alternative to synthetic compounds currently used in antimicrobial control. The obtained results highlight the possibility to use some EOs obtained as by-products from the capitalization of citrus fruits (orange and bergamot) as antimicrobial agent against some pathogenic microorganisms in binary or tertiary mixtures with clove oil. The one-component emulsions (EOEO and EBEO) do not show antimicrobial effects on the investigated strains, while the ECEO emulsion has an inhibitory capacity comparable to that of the positive control for most of the investigated strains. The antimicrobial potential and the synergistic effects of the active principles of essential oils (eugenol, limonene and Î±-pinene) are highlighted in binary E(CEO/OEO), E(CEO/BEO) or tertiary natural preparations E(CEO/OEO/BEO). Binary emulsions E(OEO/CEO) and E(BEO/CEO) are distinguished by an ability to inhibit micellar development higher to the effect generated by the positive control (gentamicin and nystatin) which recommends their use. as complementary therapies in the treatment of various infectious diseases.</p>
