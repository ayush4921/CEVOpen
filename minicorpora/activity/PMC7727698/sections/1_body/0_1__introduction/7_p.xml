<p>This paper aims to test the antimicrobial effect of natural preparations based on clove, orange and bergamot essential oils on a wide range of microorganisms that cause infections in humans including: 
 <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Shigella flexneri, Candida parapsilosis, Candida albicans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium and Haemophilus influenza</italic>. Also, the synergistic/antagonistic effects, generated by the presence of the main chemical compounds, were studied in order to recommend a preparation with optimal antimicrobial activity.
