0: Citrus oils have attracted the attention of researchers in recent years because they can be obtained as active ingredients from juice industry byproducts.
1: Orange or bergamot oils are extracted using hydrodistilatilon from the peels after juice extraction, being a secondary raw material that can be used efficiently in the context of the circular economy.
2: The antimicrobial activity of the orange essential oil (OEO) was evaluated and it exhibited significant inhibitory effects against many bacteria [ 24, 25, 26, 27].
3: Obidi O. et al., highlighted that the Gram-positive bacteria were susceptible to the OEO with inhibitory concentration ranging from 0.05 mg/mL to 1.65 mg/mL [ 24].
4: Kirbaslar G. et al., tested the antimicrobial activity of lemon, grapefruit, bergamot, bitter orange, sweet orange and mandarin peel oils on different microorganism including:  Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853,  Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538,  Escherichia coli ATCC 11230,  Candida albicans ATCC 10231 [ 25].
5: The Citrus peel oils showed strong antimicrobial activity against the Gram (+) and Gram () bacteria and the fungi cultures studied [ 26, 27].
