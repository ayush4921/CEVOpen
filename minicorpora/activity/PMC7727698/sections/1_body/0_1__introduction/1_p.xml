<p>In medical practice, infectious diseases are a major health problem and the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a challenge nowadays. In recent years there has been a growing interest in the use of natural products capable of replacing or being used to complement antibiotic treatment. Due to their availability, absence of side effects or toxicity, better biodegradability compared to available antibiotics and preservatives, essential oils (EOs) have aroused the interest of researchers [

They have been shown to be biocids against a wide range of organisms, such as bacteria, fungi, viruses, protozoa, insects and plants [
