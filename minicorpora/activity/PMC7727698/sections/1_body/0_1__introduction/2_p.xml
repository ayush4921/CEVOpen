<p>EOs can be used in medicine and pharmacy as such or in the form of natural preparations with increased pharmacological activity. The formulation of natural preparations based on EOs influences their biological activity. In scientific research, different formulas of incorporation, encapsulation of EOs in natural preparations have been experimented. The most recently tested natural preparations based on EOs with antimicrobial activity refer to monodispersed essential oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions [
