0: EOs can be used in medicine and pharmacy as such or in the form of natural preparations with increased pharmacological activity.
1: The formulation of natural preparations based on EOs influences their biological activity.
2: In scientific research, different formulas of incorporation, encapsulation of EOs in natural preparations have been experimented.
3: The most recently tested natural preparations based on EOs with antimicrobial activity refer to monodispersed essential oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions [ 7, 8, 9, 10], emulsions with sodium starch octenylsuccinate [ 11], octenyl succinic anhydride (OSA)-modified gum Arabic (GA) emulsions [ 12], emulsions stabilized with zein colloid particles [ 13], nanoemulsions containing essential oils [ 14], emulsions stabilized by zein-pectin composite nanoparticles [ 15], micro and nano-encapsulation of EOs [ 16], gum-based coatings incorporated with EOs [ 17, 18], cellulosic pads, amended with emulsions containing essential oils [ 19], electrospun nanofibers of poly(vinyl alcohol) and chitosan-based emulsions with EOs [ 20], chitosan-based materials [ 21], microencapsulation in sodium alginate and chitosan [ 22], EOs nano- and micro-sized formulations based on glycerol-plasticized cassava starch (TPS) [ 23].
