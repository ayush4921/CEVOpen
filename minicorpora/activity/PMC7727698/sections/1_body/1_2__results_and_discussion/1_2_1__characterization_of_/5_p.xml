<p>PDI values are between 0 and 1, where 0 is specific to homogeneous systems, and 1 for highly heterogeneous ones. Zeta-potential (ζ-Potential) is an indicator of emulsion stability used to measure the net surface electrical charge on the emulsion droplets [

The Zeta potential values are between −24.31:−19.72 mV, natural preparations obtained falling into the category of delicate dispersions. In general, colloidal solutions have a high tendency to form clusters/clusters–agglomerations. This agglomeration trend can be estimated using Zeta potential values: stable systems have Zeta potential values between −30 and −100 mV, where 0 mV represents the maximum agglomeration and precipitation. The decrease in the ζ-potential values would assist for the long-term stability of the emulsions [
