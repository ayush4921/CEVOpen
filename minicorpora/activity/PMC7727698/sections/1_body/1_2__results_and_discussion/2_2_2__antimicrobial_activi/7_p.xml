<p>The experimental results highlight that the optimal formula, which generates maximum inhibition effect against 
 <italic>S. pyogenes</italic>, is E(OEO/CEO). Previous studies highlighted the antimicrobial effect of analysed EOs against 
 <italic>S. pyogenes</italic>. Wijesundara and Rupasinghe tested in vitro the antibacterial effect of clove essential oil on two 
 <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> strains (ATCC 19615 and ATCC 49399) [
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-25-05502" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The results highlighted that CO exhibited an important antibacterial activity, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) concentrations ranged between 0.25–1.0 mg/mL and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were 0.5–2 mg/mL.
