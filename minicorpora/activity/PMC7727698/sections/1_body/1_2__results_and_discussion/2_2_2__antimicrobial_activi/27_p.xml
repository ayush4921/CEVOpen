<p>The antifungal activity of the analyzed emulsions against 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>Candida parapsilopsis</italic> is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05502-f001">Figure 1</xref>H,I. It is observed that the profile of the micellar growth in the case of the two analyzed fungi is similar, higher antifungal effect of the one-component emulsion ECEO being observed regardless of the concentration tested. EOEO and EBEO do not exert antifungal effect on the investigated strains. The association of E(OEO/CEO) and E(BEO/CEO) leads to an increase of the antifungal activity against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> (the diameter of the inhibition zone for E(BEO/CEO) depending on the concentration, 19/15 compared to 13.5/12.5 in the case of ECEO, respectively 19/16.5 for E(OEO/CEO), which recommends the use of these binary solutions in the control of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>.
