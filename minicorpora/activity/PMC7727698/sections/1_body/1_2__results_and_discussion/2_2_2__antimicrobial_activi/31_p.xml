 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3dot3-molecules-25-05502">Section 3.3</xref> It is observed that ECEO shows an inhibitory effect over the positive control in the case of 
 <italic>C. parapsilopsis</italic> (133.33% and 153.33% depending on the applied concentration), as well as in the case of 
 <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> (118.75% and 131.25 %). In both cases higher values of inhibition being registered when 100 ÂµL emulsion was applied (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05502-f002">Figure 2</xref>A). Natural preparations based on EOEO or EBEO in the one-component variant have a reduced antimicrobial spectrum. EOEO was found to be active only for 
 <italic>S. pyogenes</italic>, with a lower degree of inhibition than gentamicin (33.33%, respectively 38.09% depending on the amount applied), while EBEO is effective on 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> with an inhibition rate of 115.38% and 134.62%, respectively, depending on the amount applied, compared to the positive control (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05502-f002">Figure 2</xref>B,C). The association of EOs in binary mixtures of type E(BEO/CEO), E(OEO/CEO) and E(OEO/BEO) leads to synergistic effects of the active principles from the monocomponent variants and the potentiation of the microbial inhibition by the natural preparations.
