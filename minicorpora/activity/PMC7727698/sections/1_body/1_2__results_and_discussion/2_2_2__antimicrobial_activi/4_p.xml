<p>The association of E(BEO/OEO) does not show antibacterial effect against 
 <italic>S. pyogenes</italic>, regardless of the component concentration. This behavior can be generated by the antagonistic effects of the OEO and BEO active principles. BEO contains in addition to D-limonene, in significant concentration, α-pinene (32.63%), but also other minority compounds such as: 
 <italic>o</italic>-cymene (3.82%), 4-carene (6.35%) and β-linalool (3.02%), probably responsible for the antagonistic action on 
 <italic>S. pyogenes</italic>. Also, the E(BEO/CEO) association decreases the antibacterial effect of 
 <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> compared to the ECEO. The major compound in CEO is eugenol, responsible for the effects of inhibiting micellar growth, effect diminished by the addition of BEO, especially when increasing its concentration (17.5 mm diameter of the inhibition zone for a concentration of 150 µL emulsion).
