<p>From the data shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05502-f001">Figure 1</xref>A it is observed that the ECEO exerts a greater inhibitory effect on 
 <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> (25 mm inhibition area, for a concentration of 100 µL) higher compared to the positive control gentamicin (21 mm diameter inhibition). The diameter of the inhibition zone for EOEO is 7–8 mm depending on the applied concentration, and for EBEO the effect of inhibiting the micellar development of 
 <italic>S pyogenes</italic> is zero, regardless of the applied concentration. The application of binary solutions E(OEO/CEO) leads to the potentiation of the capacity to inhibit micellar development (28.5 mm, respectively 23.5 mm), synergistic activity developed by associating the active principles from the two EOs, eugenol from CEO and D-limonene from OEO, respectively.
