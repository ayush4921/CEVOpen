<p>Considering the different potential of the emulsions depending on their chemical composition, the determination of MIC, both for emulsions, EOs and and of the main chemical compounds was performed. The MIC is defined as the lowest concentration of the compounds to inhibit the growth of microorganisms. The MICs (ÂµL/100 mL) values of main chemical compounds (eugenol, limonene and alfa-pinene), EOs: clove (CEO), orange (OEO), bergamot (BEO) and natural preparation are presented in the
