<p>The effect of the aforementioned plant extracts on the viability of HFF cells was investigated according to the method described by [
 <xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Briefly, HFF cells were grown in 96-well plates with 100 µl Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Sigma-Aldrich) in each well (cell suspension, 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/ml in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS). After 48 hr of incubation at 37°C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere, 100 µl of the plant extracts dissolved in DMEM were added to the cells (final concentrations, 7.8–1,000 µg/ml). Wells with sulfadiazine or culture medium only served as the positive and negative controls, respectively. After 72 hr, cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8, Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan) was added to determine cell viability. Their optical densities were detected at 450 nm using an MTP-120 microplate reader (Corona Electric, Hitachinaka, Japan). HFF cell growth suppression (%) was estimated using the following equation:
