<p>Toxoplasmosis, a cosmopolitan zoonotic parasitic infection, is caused by an Apicomplexa intracellular protozoan, 
 <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> [
 <xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Members of the Felidae family are the definitive hosts of 
 <italic>T. gondii</italic>. Humans can be infected by 
 <italic>T. gondii</italic> through the ingestion of 
 <italic>T. gondii</italic> cysts present in undercooked or raw meat of intermediate hosts such as cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, and chickens [

 <xref rid="r90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. It has been reported that up to one-third of the global population is affected by this disease with varying degrees of severity depending on immune status [
 <xref rid="r88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Toxoplasmosis is usually asymptomatic in immune-competent people, causing chronic infection with parasite cyst formation in tissues. However, in hosts with a waned immune system as AIDS patients or chemotherapy-treated patients, it may lead to vigorous systemic disease and subsequently death [
 <xref rid="r85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Importantly, toxoplasmosis in pregnant women may lead to miscarriage or fetal abnormalities (hydrocephaly, calcification) or neurological illness in newborns [
