<p>Sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine are the two medications that are concomitantly used currently in the treatment of toxoplasmosis [
 <xref rid="r63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. These drugs exert their action by blocking the 
 <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> folate metabolism, which consequently inhibits the generation of the DNA and eventually blocks the replication of tachyzoites [
 <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, there are many drawbacks that constrict the utilization of these current chemotherapeutic agents, including their restricted activity in eradicating 
 <italic>T. gondii</italic> encysted bradyzoites [
 <xref rid="r60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>], which may cause serious undesirable effects such as suppression of the bone marrow, hematological reactions, embryopathies, gastrointestinal upset, and hypersensitivity [
 <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of novel, efficient, and safe compounds with less toxicity and short medicating courses.
