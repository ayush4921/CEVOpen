 <italic>M. chamomilla</italic> (
 <italic>German chamomile</italic>) is a member of the Asteraceae family. In folk medicine, chamomile flowers have traditionally been used to alleviate upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tract illnesses and inflammatory conditions of the skin [
 <xref rid="r73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] and as a remedy for nightmares, insomnia, and hysteria. It has been reported to have anti-oxidant, antispasmodic, antidiarrheal, anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic, antimicrobial, and antidepressant features [

 <italic>M. chamomilla</italic> (
 <italic>German chamomile</italic>) possesses several compounds that are responsible for its biological activities [
 <xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The major phenolic compounds found in chamomile flowers are flavonoids, quercetin, patuletin, apigenin, luteolin, glucosides, and coumarins (umbelliferone and herniarin) [
 <xref rid="r54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The findings of our study indicate that the methanol extract of chamomile flowers is an effective anti-
 <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> agent. Hence, this effect on 
 <italic>T. gondii</italic> growth may be attributed to any one or a combination of its bioactive ingredients.
