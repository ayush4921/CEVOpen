<p>Over the last three decades, the high resistance of infectious organisms to chemotherapeutic agents has accounted for the failure of routine medication in the management of some infections [
 <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Among the growing resistance problems, the current anti-
 <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> drugs have been reported to be less effective against parasites owing to genetic mutation [
 <xref rid="r62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Hence, there is an increasing demand for the development of new remedies for toxoplasmosis. Recently, great attention has been paid to the discovery of novel antiparasitic agents from medicinal plants. It has been reported that several herbal extracts were effective against 
 <italic>T. gondii</italic> such as 
 <italic>Eurycoma longifolia</italic> Jack [
 <xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], Curcuma [
 <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], 
 <italic>Artemisia annua</italic> L. [
 <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], and 
 <italic>Myristica fragrans</italic> Houtt [
 <xref rid="r74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. The screening of herbal extracts to determine anti-
 <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> efficacy is considered a method for developing new drugs for toxoplasmosis. In the present study, the methanol extracts of six plants and oil extracts of ten plants were investigated 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, for the first time, for their antitoxoplasmal effects against 
 <italic>T. gondii</italic>.
