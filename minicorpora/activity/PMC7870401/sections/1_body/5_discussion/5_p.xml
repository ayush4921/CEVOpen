<p>Citronella grass (
 <italic>Cymbopogon nardus Rendle</italic>) belongs to the Poaceae family. Citronella oil is commonly used as an antipyretic, diuretic, and antispasmodic agent and for the treatment of intestinal parasites [
 <xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. It is widely used as an insect repellent, especially as a repellent against fleas, mosquitoes, and biting flies [
 <xref rid="r68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. In addition, citronella oil is used in the manufacture of detergents, soaps, fragrances, and perfumes [
 <xref rid="r71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. The major components detected in the citronella grass essential oil were monoterpenes, which include geraniol (28.62%), citronellal (23.62%), and citronellol (17.10%) [
 <xref rid="r75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. The present study showed that citronella oil has acceptable activity against 
 <italic>T. gondii</italic> RH 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, with an SI value &gt;10. The anti-
 <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> activity of citronella oil is probably owed to its chemical constituents. Monoterpenes have been reported to exert antileishmanial activity [
 <xref rid="r51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. However, further studies are needed to explore the mechanism of action of citronella oil against 
 <italic>T. gondii.</italic>
