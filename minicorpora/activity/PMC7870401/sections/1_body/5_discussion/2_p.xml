<p>All the examined plant extracts revealed varying degrees of anti-

 <italic>M. chamomilla</italic> (
 <italic>German chamomile</italic>), 
 <italic>C. colocynthis,</italic> and 
 <italic>L. nobilis</italic> and the essential oils of lemon grass, citronella, and marjoram exhibited higher growth inhibition than sulfadiazine. Importantly,

 <sub>50</sub> values for 
 <italic>T. gondii</italic> RH-GFP (3.56 µg/ml and 2.54 µg/ml, respectively) and the highest SI values (130.33 and 15.02, respectively), were demonstrated to be the most potent. These SI values were considered as hallmarks for the selective activity of the therapy.
