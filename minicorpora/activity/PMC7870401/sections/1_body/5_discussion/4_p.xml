<p>Flavonoids have been shown to possess activity against 
 <italic>Cryptosporidium parvum</italic>,
 <italic> Leishmania donovani</italic>,

 <italic>Leishmania tropica</italic> amastigote [
 <xref rid="r66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. In addition, previous reports have shown that coumarins exhibit activity against the promastigote form of Leishmania major and
