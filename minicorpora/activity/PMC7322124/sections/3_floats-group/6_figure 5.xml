  <p>Molecular docking analysis of thymol of 
   <italic>Ocimum viride</italic> (leaf) essential oil. (A) Against the bacterial Sec A ATPase. Green ligand is surrounded by amino acid residues with which ligand has hydrogen bonds. The amino acids are labeled as xxx123. In the binding moiety Lys, Trp, Leu, Arg, Glu and Pro are placed at 284, 275, 269, 19, 277 and 270 positions respectively. (B) Against the bacterial Sec A ATPase
   <italic>.</italic> Docking view of 2-Isopropyl-5-methylcyclohexanol against secondary structure of 3RPH with red colour showing helix. (C) Against human Beclin 2 CCD homodimer. Green ligand is surrounded by amino acid Tyr21 residue having hydrogen bond, Gln198 residue having non polar bond and Arg209 residue having non polar bond.
