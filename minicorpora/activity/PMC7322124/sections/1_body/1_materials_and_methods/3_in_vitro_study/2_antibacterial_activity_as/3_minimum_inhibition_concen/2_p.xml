 <italic>O. viride</italic> leaves EO was determined according to the broth dilution technique. Standardized suspensions of the most susceptible bacterial strain was inoculated into a series of sterile tubes of nutrient broth containing two-fold dilutions of EO and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The MIC was read as the least concentration that inhibited the growth of the test organisms.
