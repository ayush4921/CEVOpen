<p id="p0060">Cell cycle analysis was performed in accordance with the method reported earlier (
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Park et al., 2007</xref>). Colon HT-29 cells (106 cells/mL) in their exponential growing phase were dispended in a six well plate and maintained for 24 h in incubator. Cells were then treated with EO (0.1 μL/mL) and incubated for further 24 h. Cells were trypsnised, centrifuged and washed with PBS. Cells were fixed in 70% ethanol, washed with PBS and then incubated with propidium iodide (PI; 25 μg/mL). RNA was removed using RNAase at 37 °C for 30 min. The percentages of cells having the sub-G1 population were measured using BD-LSR flow cytometry equipped with blue (488 nm) excitation from argon laser.
