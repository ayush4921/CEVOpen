<p id="p0065">Morphological changes of apoptotic cells were also examined using fluorescence microscopy. The HT-29 cells were treated with the 0.1 μg/ml of the essential oil and further cells were harvested, fixed with absolute ethanol, and stained with Hoechst 33258 for 15 min at 37 °C. The cells were then visualized using fluorescence microscopy (Olympus 1 × 70, Tokyo, Japan) with UV excitation at 300–500 nm. Cells containing condensed and/or fragmented nuclei were considered to be apoptotic cells (
