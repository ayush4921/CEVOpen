<p id="p0070">Protein structures were retrieved from RCSB PDB in .pdb text format and various possible binding sites for thymol were predicted from COACH server. PyMOL, a molecular visualization tool, was used to identify desired protein sequences in the target protein for binding affinities with thymol. Different analogs of thymol were also searched in ZINC database and analysed for their potential to bind Sec A protein (bacterial protein secretory (Sec) pathway) and Beclin 2 protein (Beclin gene binds to the apoptosis-inhibiting protein Bcl-2). The structure of thymol was retrieved from the Zinc Database in .mol2 format. The drug-like property of thymol was measured using Lipinski filter. The protein and ligand molecule were imported in Mauler Virtual Docker and visualized for drug interaction sites by using Molegro visualize (
