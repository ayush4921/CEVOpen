<p id="p0085">Antibacterial activity was assessed against five gram positive and five gram negative bacterial strains (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Essential oil strongly inhibited the growth of 
 <italic>Micrococcus luteus</italic> (zone of inhibition; 11 ± 0.4mm)
 <italic>, Bacillus subtilis</italic> (zone of inhibition; 14 ± 0.5mm)
 <italic>, Psudomonas alcaligenes</italic> (zone of inhibition; 10 ± 0.6mm), 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> (zone of inhibition; 12 ± 0.6mm) whereas moderate growth inhibitory activity was observed against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (zone of inhibition; 04 ± 0.2mm), 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> (zone of inhibition; 06 ± 0.2mm)
 <italic>, Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (zone of inhibition; 05 ± 0.3mm), 
 <italic>Alcaligenes denitrificans</italic> (zone of inhibition; 06 ± 0.3mm) while no significant antibacterial effect was observed against 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and 
 <italic>Campylobacter coli</italic>. Chloramphenicol was used as reference antibiotic and results were comparable to the standard used. Overall, essential oil possesses potent antibacterial effect against the broad range of gram positive and gram negative bacteria. Further minimum inhibition concentration of most susceptible strain 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> was found to be 0.5 μl/ml of the essential oil.
