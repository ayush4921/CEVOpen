<p id="p0110">To understand the possible mechanism behind the antibacterial activity of EO against the bacteria 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, molecular docking analysis was performed for the major constituent present in EO i.e., for thymol against bacterial proteins SecA, (general protein secretory (Sec) pathway, the peripheral membrane ATPase SecA, which provides the energy for the translocation of preproteins across the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane). It was found that thymol shows the best binding affinity with bacterial sec A protein. With the protein Sec A ATPase, an interaction was observed with minimal H-Bond energy of -2.5 kcal/mol by many components of different analogs of thymol followed by the scoring function in order to evaluate the interactions between sec A ATPase and thymol. Docking energy was used to identify the correct binding pose and then ranked the most befitting target ligand complex based on their binding affinity and RMSD value (root-mean-square deviation) that is the measure of the average distance between the atoms (usually the backbone atoms) of superimposed. The RMSD Matrix dialog can be used to quickly inspect deviations between molecules in the workspace. In addition to the standard measure Pairwise Atom-Atom RMSD (by ID), two variants Pairwise Atom-Atom RMSD (checking all automorphisms) and Pairwise Atom-Atom RMSD (by nearest unmatched neighbor) of the RMSD measure were tried to take intrinsic symmetries of the molecule into account when calculating RMSD. In this study we used Pairwise Atom-Atom RMSD (checking all automorphisms), to calculate the RMSD and with the help of software Molegro Virtual Docker (MVD) the binding energy of thymol was predicted. Different analogs of thymol were used but the best analog (zinc id - 967515) obtained on the basis predicted binding energy and other binding parameters like hydrogen bond interaction and electrostatic interaction was selected. After docking thymol was found to interact with protein Sec A with binding energy 
 <bold>-</bold>15 kcal/mol with the active site Lys284, Trp275, Leu269, Arg19,Glu277, pro270 (Figures 
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A and 5B). Three bonding site between ligand and cavity1 portion containing part of protein (Thr141, Asn93, Ile20) having respective solvation energy (-3.54,-8.31, 4.89) and respective bond types are Thr141 and C3 of drug non polar hydrophobic bond having bond length 1.53225 Asn93 and oxygen of drug having covalent bond of length 0.68 (covalent bonds are always tighter) Ile20 and c9 of drug having non polar hydrophobic bond of length 1.52998 was observed. Similarly, thymol was tried to docked with protein Beclin 2, that functions in autophagy via interaction of class III PI3K complex components and Bcl-2. It was found that thymol shows the best binding affinity with protein Beclin 2 CCD homodimer. Three main bonds are involved, first bond between Tyr21 (chain A) and ligand of energy -1.143154 &amp; length 3.31369 a hydrogen bond having properties of donor rotable second bond between N7 of Gln198 and ligand is non polar with length 0.68 ∗A and sp2 hybridisation at 120∗ angle third bond is also non polar between Arg209 and ligand having 0.68 length sp2 hybridisation and 120° angle (
