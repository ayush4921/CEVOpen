 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). The morphological changes and cell death of HT 29 cells were observed at concentrations of 0.1 μl/mL. Most cells were detached from the dishes, and cell rounding and shrinking occurred at the same concentration of the essential oil. Number of Hoeschst positive nuclei upon treatment with essential oil was found higher in comparison of untreated sample as indicated in
