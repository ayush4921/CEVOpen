<p id="p0115">Demand and use for natural compounds with relevant medicinal properties have been increasing worldwide. Essential oils (EOs) and other phytoproducts are examples of natural products that have gained interest, mainly due to their suitable chemical characteristics and various biological activities. Various studies reported that essential oil act as natural bioactive substances and can induce sensitive growth inhibition against microbes as well as against cancer cells via inducing apoptosis (
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Cabral and Lemos, 2018</xref>). In this study we attempted to explore the potential of essential oil from 
 <italic>Ocimum viride</italic> (leaves) as an antibacterial and anticancer agent. Earlier reports claim to contain a large number of aromatic components mainly thymol, eugenol, cymene and limonene in essential oil of 
 <italic>Ocimum viride</italic> (
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Ali and Setzer, 2013</xref>), our results are also in accordance to these reports indicating thymol (a terpene) as major constituent in the essential oil obtained from the aerial part of 
 <italic>Ocimum viride</italic>. Thymol has been extensively explored as a potential antibacterial and anticancer agent (
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Carocho, 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Islam et al., 2019</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Moon et al., 2017</xref>). Additionally, isolataed essential oil of 
 <italic>Ocimum viride</italic> comparatively showed highest sensitivity towards 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> pathogen (14 ± 0.5mm) with MIC value of 0.5 μl/ml. Further, the relationship between the major component of essential oil and antibacterial activity were drawn with the help of molecular docking studies, here a well known Sec pathway protein (Sec A) was docked with thymol to predict the best binding efficiency. The molecular docking of thymol with bacterial Sec A protein resulted in best binding energy of -15 kcal/mol with the active site Lys284, Trp275, Leu269, Arg19, Glu277 and Pro270. Since bacterial secA is an ATP-driven motor protein that is responsible for post translational translocation of proteins by and possibly serving as receptor for thymol thereby causing interference in protein transport in bacteria (
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Steinberg et al., 2018</xref>). In recent years Sec A has been widely recognized as a druggable target as more than 30% of bacterial proteins are destined to function at the cell envelope or outside the cell. Sec-pathway is universally conserved in bacteria (as well as in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of eukaryotes and thylakoid membranes in plants) and is the primary route for protein export (
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">De Waelheyns et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Driessen and Nouwen, 2008</xref>). The vast majority of the proteins have functionally diverse roles such as nutrient uptake, excretion, metabolism, cell structure, communication, virulence and bacterial defense are known to transported via the ubiquitous secretion (Sec-) pathway (
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">De Waelheyns et al., 2014</xref>) further making it interesting antimicrobial target. Moreover, we also sought to determine the mechanism by which essential oil of 
 <italic>Ocimum viride</italic> exert its antiproliferative properties against HT-29 human colon cancer cells. Initially, MTT assay a commonly used endpoint method to assess the cytotoxicity was applied and here the viable cells with active metabolism converted MTT into a purple colored formazan product with an absorbance maximum at 570 nm. On cell death, they lose the ability to convert MTT into formazan, and color formation is observed that serves as a useful and convenient marker for viable cells (
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Mosmann, 1983</xref>). In this study, cytotxicity of the essential oil was evaluated against six cancer cell lines 
 <italic>viz</italic>., prostate (DU-145), liver (HEP-2), neuroblastoma (IMR-32) and colon (HT-29, 502713, SW-620) and dose-dependent cytotxic response was observed against all the cancer cell lines. Here the highest ability to reduce MTT to the formazan derivative was observed against colon (HT-29) cancer cell line with IC50 value of 0.034 ± 0.001 μl/ml indicating the prominent cytotoxic/antiproliferative effect of the essential oil. As, induction of apoptosis in cancer cells is now considered as an indicator of the cancer treatment response, this study also elucidated the mode of cell death by EO was against colon (HT-29) cancer cells. Apoptosis is recognized for the physiological cell death that is accompanied by a specialized series of cellular events such as chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation, cytoplasmic membrane blebbing and cell shrinkage (
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">De Waelheyns et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Galluzzi et al., 2018</xref>). The internucleosomal cleavage of DNA into oligonucleosomal size fragments is considered a biochemical hallmark of apoptosis. DNA isolated from treated HT-29 colon cancer cells, showed DNA fragments smearing away from the wells in agarose gel electrophoresis, forming a discreet ladder with the increase in concentrations of the essential oil. The genomic integrity is maintained by protecting cell division through the regulation of cell cycle checkpoints. However, the detection of DNA damage may force cells to undergo apoptosis rather than division (
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Visconti et al., 2016</xref>). The flow cytometric analysis of cell cycle distribution in our study indicated the increased population in the G2/M-phase and S-phase after 24 h treatment by inhibitory concentration of essential oil as compared to control. Sub-G1 peaks, which represent the cell population containing apoptotic nuclear fragments, were markedly increased after treatment that may be due to the possibility of DNA damage and failure of repair mechanism in the cells, thus blocking the cell cycle at the S-phase and preventing cell entry into the proliferative phase thus effecting the HT-29 cancer cell proliferation. In addition, fluorescent staining with Hoechst 33258 showed increased and consistent nuclear condensation and shrinkage, cell growth inhibition and apoptotic body formation in EO treated colon cancer cells in comparison to control cells that showed rounded intact nuclei. Similar findings on the 
 <italic>Ocimum viride</italic> essential oil were also reported by Sharma and coworkers against COLO 205 cells (
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Sharma et al., 2016</xref>), other species from Ocimum genus such as 
 <italic>Ocimum basilium</italic> showed 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> cytotoxicity against cancer cells (
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Zarlaha et al., 2014</xref>), 
 <italic>Ocimum sanctum</italic> showed to trigger cell death by apoptosis against human breast, liver and oral cancer cells etc (
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Manaharan et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Sharma et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Shivpuje et al., 2015</xref>). Molecular docking analysis was performed to confirm the binding efficacy of thymol from essential oil to Beclin protein that functions in autophagy, it interacts with class III PI3K complex components and Bcl-2 and lysosomal degradation pathway (
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Domínguez-Martín et al., 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2017</xref>). Hence, the current study supports that 
 <italic>Ocimum viride</italic> essential oil induced antibacterial effect as well as anticancer effect in HT-29 colon cancer cells.
