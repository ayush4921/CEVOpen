<p id="p0010">Essential oils are the aromatic, volatile and complex liquids obtained from different parts of plants. These are secondary metabolites that are primarily involved in defensive mechanisms in plants and usually consists terpenes (mono, sesquiterpenes and diterpens), alcohol, esters, citons, acids, apoxides, aldehyde, sulfide, amine etc. Apart from their various uses in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, perfumes, food and alcoholic beverages, these are also reported for various biological properties such as antimicrobial, analgesic, antioxidant, antiviral, antispasmodic, carminative, analgesic, anti-inflammation etc (

As antibiotic and chemotherapeutic drug resistance has become a global concern, essential oils and other phyto-products have gained interest, mainly due to their suitable chemical characteristics and biological activities. Various scientific investigators are now focused on elucidating the specific mode of action of essential oils components as well as to explore the synergistic effect of essential oil components and also with the existing antibiotic or chemotherapeutic drugs that may provide an alternative approach to rectify the emerging drug resistance.
