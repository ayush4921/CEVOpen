  <p>
   <italic>Ocimum viride</italic> Willd. (family: 
   <italic>Lamiaceae</italic>) is a member of the genus Ocimum, an aromatic annual and perennial herb with numerous culinary, horticultural and ethno-medicinal benefits. This study aims to explore the chemical properties of leaf essential oil (EO) from 
   <italic>Ocimum viride</italic> and to evaluate its antimicrobial and anticancer potential.

  <title>Main methods</title>
  <p>Characterization of essential oil was done by GCMS, antimicrobial by agar well diffusion methods, 
   <italic>in vitro</italic> cytotoxicity evaluation by MTT assay, cell death analysis was done by DNA fragmentation, cell cycle analysis, nuclear morphology analysis and molecular docking studies were also conducted.

  <title>Key findings</title>
  <p>Essential oil from aerial parts (leaf) of 
   <italic>Ocimum viride</italic> revealed high content of oxygenated monoterpenes, notably thymol (~50%) and γ-terpinene (~18%). Further, antibacterial analysis showed that among all the evaluated bacterial species EO showed highest sensitivity against the 
   <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and was also found most effective against HT-29 colon cancer cell line with IC50 value of ~0.034 ± 0.001μL/mL. Mechanistic studies revealed that EO inhibits the growth of HT-29 colon cancer cells probably through induction of irreparable DNA damage leading to subsequent cell death in apoptotic manner. Molecular docking analysis also supports the 
   <italic>in vitro</italic> studies conducted by indicating the interaction of thymol with Sec A protein of 
   <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> cell wall as well as with Beclin protein responsible for apoptotic corpse clearance.

  <title>Significance</title>
  <p>Taken together, our results indicate that EO possesses potent antimicrobial and anticancer properties, and may find applications as effective antibacterial and in cancer therapeutics.</p>
