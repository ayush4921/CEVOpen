0: AimsOcimum viride Willd.
1: (family:    Lamiaceae) is a member of the genus Ocimum, an aromatic annual and perennial herb with numerous culinary, horticultural and ethno-medicinal benefits.
2: This study aims to explore the chemical properties of leaf essential oil (EO) from    Ocimum viride and to evaluate its antimicrobial and anticancer potential.
3: Main methodsCharacterization of essential oil was done by GCMS, antimicrobial by agar well diffusion methods,    in vitro cytotoxicity evaluation by MTT assay, cell death analysis was done by DNA fragmentation, cell cycle analysis, nuclear morphology analysis and molecular docking studies were also conducted.
4: Key findingsEssential oil from aerial parts (leaf) of    Ocimum viride revealed high content of oxygenated monoterpenes, notably thymol (~50%) and -terpinene (~18%).
5: Further, antibacterial analysis showed that among all the evaluated bacterial species EO showed highest sensitivity against the    Bacillus subtilis and was also found most effective against HT-29 colon cancer cell line with IC50 value of ~0.034  0.001L/mL.
6: Mechanistic studies revealed that EO inhibits the growth of HT-29 colon cancer cells probably through induction of irreparable DNA damage leading to subsequent cell death in apoptotic manner.
7: Molecular docking analysis also supports the    in vitro studies conducted by indicating the interaction of thymol with Sec A protein of    Bacillus subtilis cell wall as well as with Beclin protein responsible for apoptotic corpse clearance.
8: SignificanceTaken together, our results indicate that EO possesses potent antimicrobial and anticancer properties, and may find applications as effective antibacterial and in cancer therapeutics.
