<p>Essential oils can be composed of only a few to up to more than 100 single substances [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-26-00666" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Being natural mixtures of a very complex nature, essential oils may consist of about 20–60 components at quite different concentrations, with two or three major components being present at fairly high concentrations (20–70%), compared with other components present in trace amounts [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-26-00666" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The flavor contribution of single compounds, though, does not strictly depend on their respective concentration but relies on the specific odor threshold that is determined by structure and volatility. Consequently, even minor components deriving from oxidation or degradation reactions may have a strong impact on the flavor if their aroma value is high enough [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-26-00666" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. For the most part, essential oil components can be assigned as lipophilic terpenoids, phenylpropanoids, or short-chain aliphatic hydrocarbon derivatives of low molecular weight, with the first being the most frequent and characteristic constituents. Among these, allylic, mono-, bi-, or tricyclic mono- and sesquiterpenoids of different chemical classes make up a major part of essential oils, such as hydrocarbons, ketones, alcohols, oxides, aldehydes, phenols, or esters [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00666-f001">Figure 1</xref>). The absence of even one component may change the aroma. In general, monoterpene hydrocarbons are less valuable regarding their contribution to the fragrance of the essential oil than oxygenated compounds, which are highly odoriferous [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-26-00666" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In addition to their chemical properties, essential oils can be seen to vary greatly in their physical properties in terms of their density, refractive index, and rotatory power. For instance, the essential oils of the different organs (limbo, foliar sheath, and rhizomes) of 
 <italic>Siphonochilus ethiopicus</italic> were reported to significantly differ in those physical properties. These properties contribute to a better characterization of plant essential oils [
