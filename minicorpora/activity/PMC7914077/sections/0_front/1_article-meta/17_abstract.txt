0: Syzygium aromaticum has a diversity of biological activities due to the chemical compounds found in its plant products such as total phenolic compounds and flavonoids.
1: The present work describes the chemical analysis and antimicrobial, antioxidant, and antitrypanosomal activity of the essential oil of   S. aromaticum.
2: Eugenol (53.23%) as the major compound was verified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.
3: S. aromaticum essential oil was more effective against   S. aureus (MIC 50   g/mL) than eugenol (MIC 250   g/mL).
4: Eugenol presented higher antioxidant activity than   S. aromaticum essential oil, with an EC  50 of 12.66 and 78.98   g/mL, respectively.
5: S. aromaticum essential oil and eugenol exhibited   Trypanosoma cruzi inhibitory activity, with IC  50 of 28.68  1.073 and 31.97  1.061   g/mL against epimastigotes and IC  50 of 64.51  1.658 and 45.73  1.252   g/mL against intracellular amastigotes, respectively.
6: Both compounds presented low cytotoxicity, with   S. aromaticum essential oil displaying 15.5-fold greater selectivity for the parasite than the cells.
7: Nitrite levels in   T. cruzi-stimulated cells were reduced by essential oil (47.01%;   p = 0.002) and eugenol (48.05%;   p = 0.003) treatment.
8: The trypanocidal activity of   S. aromaticum essential oil showed that it is reasonable to use it in future research in the search for new therapeutic alternatives for trypanosomiasis.
