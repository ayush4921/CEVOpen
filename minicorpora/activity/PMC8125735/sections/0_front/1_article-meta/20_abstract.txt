0: Despite progress achieved, there is limited available information about the antibacterial activity of constituents of essential oils (EOs) from different medicinal-aromatic plants (MAPs) against fish pathogens and the complex interactions of blended EOs thereof.
1: The present study aimed to investigate possible synergistic antimicrobial effects of EOs from seven Greek MAPs with strong potential against   Aeromonas veronii bv.
2: sobria, a fish pathogen associated with aquaculture disease outbreaks.
3: The main objective was to evaluate whether blending of these EOs can lead to increased antimicrobial activity against the specific microorganism.
4: A total of 127 combinations of EOs were prepared and their effect on   A. veronii bv.
5: sobria growth was tested in vitro.
6: We examined both the inhibitory and bactericidal activities of the individual EOs and compared them to those of the blended EOs.
7: The vast majority of the investigated combinations exhibited significant synergistic and additive effects, while antagonistic effects were evident only in a few cases, such as the mixtures containing EOs from rosemary, lemon balm and pennyroyal.
8: The combination of EOs from Greek oregano and wild carrot, as well as the combinations of those two with Spanish oregano or savoury were the most promising ones.
9: Overall, Greek oregano, savoury and Spanish oregano EOs were the most effective ones when applied either in pure form or blended with other EOs.
