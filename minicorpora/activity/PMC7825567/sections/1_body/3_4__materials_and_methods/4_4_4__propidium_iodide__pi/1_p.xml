<p>The fluorescent dye PI uptake assay was performed to understand the antifungal mechanism(s) of α-Cyperone. Control and α-Cyperone treated 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>C. krusei</italic> cells (16 h treated) were incubated with diluted PI solution in dark conditions for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed with PBS and viewed under a fluorescent microscope (Leica, DM 6 B with a camera attached) using Texas red filter. Untreated cells (autofluorescence) and heat-killed cells (positive control) were also included. Similar results for 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>C. krusei</italic> were observed and results only for 
 <italic>C. krusei</italic> are shown.
