<p>Since α-Cyperone is an EO and the EOs affect mostly the cellular membrane (e.g., fungi) [
 <xref rid="B24-antibiotics-10-00051" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], we performed the propidium iodide (PI) uptake assay for α-Cyperone treated (125 µg/mL) 
 <italic>C. krusei</italic> cells. Cells with intact membranes are impermeable to fluorescent dye, PI, unless the membrane integrity is lost due to α-Cyperone exposure. As a positive control for PI staining, heat-killed (boiled for 5 min) 
 <italic>C. krusei</italic> cells were used. As expected, the fluorescence microscopy analysis of heat-killed cells showed uptake of PI dye. Unexpectedly, α-Cyperone treated cells did not show fluorescence, which suggests that α-Cyperone does not affect the cell membrane (

 <italic>C. krusei</italic> did not show any autofluorescence under similar conditions (not shown).
