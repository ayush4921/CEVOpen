0: A non- Candida fungal pathogen that also affects the immunocompromised is  Cryptococcus neoformans.
1: In the developing world, there are ~1 million cases of cryptococcal diseases per year, resulting in 675,000 deaths [ 7, 8].
2: Cryp.
3: neoformans is a major cause of fungal meningitis worldwide.
4: Cryp.
5: neoformans is further distinguished from  Candida species by  Cryp.
6: neoformans ability to develop a capsule.
7: The capsule acts as the main virulence factor of  Cryp.
8: neoformans by preventing the macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils in the immune system from effectively containing the fungus [ 7, 9, 10, 11].
9: In addition to its antiphagocytic functions, the capsule protects the fungus against desiccation in the environment [ 12].
10: Cryp.
11: neoformans has also been reported to be able to develop increased resistance to common antifungals.
12: A study in Uganda indicated that the MIC 90 of fluconazole to  Cryp.
13: neoformans increased from 8 g/mL to 32 g/mL between 1998 and 2014 [ 13].
14: Furthermore, 31% of clinical isolates from that study were no longer susceptible to fluconazole [ 13].
15: While there are limited clinical antifungals available to manage these fungal pathogens, the increasing frequency of drug-resistance to available antifungals and their limitations including host toxicity, range of cellular targets, and oral bioavailability [ 3, 14] warrants continued research and development for novel antifungal agents against these fungal pathogens.
