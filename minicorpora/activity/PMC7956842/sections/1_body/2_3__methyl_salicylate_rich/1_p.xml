<p>Methyl salicylate is a phenolic ester that dominates wintergreen (
 <italic>Gaultheria procumbens</italic> L.) (96.0–99.5%) [
 <xref rid="B92-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>] and sweet birch (
 <italic>Betula lenta</italic> L.) (90.4%) oils [
 <xref rid="B22-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Methyl salicylate is largely hydrolyzed into salicylic acid in the liver [
 <xref rid="B93-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. Following topical application in humans, methyl salicylate can be transdermally absorbed and converted to salicylic acid in the dermal and subcutaneous tissues [
 <xref rid="B94-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>,
 <xref rid="B95-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. Orally taken methyl salicylate is metabolized faster in rats and dogs than in humans which means a higher toxicity in humans [
 <xref rid="B96-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. Methyl salicylate poisoning in humans is known to cause fever, nausea, vomiting, CNS excitation, tachycardia, rapid breathing, high blood pressure, respiratory failure, pneumonia, pulmonary edema, convulsions, and coma [
 <xref rid="B97-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. Methyl salicylate poisoning in humans has a 50–60% mortality rate which is a result of cardiovascular collapse and respiratory failure [
 <xref rid="B98-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>,
 <xref rid="B99-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. Methyl salicylate showed in vitro human estrogen receptor α (hERα) agonistic activity [
 <xref rid="B100-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. Salicylates have been shown to cross the placenta [
 <xref rid="B101-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>] and lead to restricted growth and congenital abnormalities in animal experiments [
 <xref rid="B102-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. The fact that superoxide dismutase treatment prevented salicylate-induced malformations in rat embryos suggests that free oxygen radicals play a role in its teratogenic action [
 <xref rid="B103-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. Intraperitoneal injection of methyl salicylate (200 or 400 mg/kg, pregnant rats on gestational days 9 and 10) dose-dependently reduced the development of the brain, lung, liver, and kidney of the fetus [
 <xref rid="B104-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. Methyl salicylate (i.p., 50 or 100 µL) given to female rats on gestational days 10 and 11 resulted in retardation of fetal kidney development. At 100 µL, maternal weight gain was retarded, the offspring were fewer and smaller, and resorptions and malformations were increased [
 <xref rid="B105-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. A single subcutaneous injection of methyl salicylate (1.5 mL/kg on gestation day 7, 9, or 11) to female rats resulted in higher fetal deaths, reduced fetal weight, and cleft palate and tail abnormalities [
 <xref rid="B106-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. At 200, 250, or 300 mg/kg/day (i.p., on gestation days 11–12), methyl salicylate showed teratogenicity and embryotoxicity in pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats [
 <xref rid="B107-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. Methyl salicylate increases the occurrence of dilated renal pelvis in the rat fetus and causes a temporary maturation delay in the rat’s ability to concentrate urine [
 <xref rid="B107-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. In another experiment, several anomalies were observed in the offspring digestive tract, CNS, liver, and skeleton following a single subcutaneous injection of methyl salicylate (0.1–0.5 mL on gestational day 9, 10, or 11) in pregnant rats [
 <xref rid="B108-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. Subcutaneous administration of methyl salicylate (400 mg/kg) caused a substantial decrease in plasma calcium levels in pregnant rats and mice which might be linked to the fetal toxicity [
 <xref rid="B109-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. In pregnant hamsters, oral or topical methyl salicylate caused neural tube fusion failure in the embryos [
 <xref rid="B93-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>,
 <xref rid="B110-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. In addition, high oral doses of wintergreen EO were toxic and teratogenic in rats and monkeys [
 <xref rid="B102-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. Based on the available information, use of methyl salicylate-rich essential oils or any preparations containing them, by any route, should be avoided during pregnancy and lactation.
