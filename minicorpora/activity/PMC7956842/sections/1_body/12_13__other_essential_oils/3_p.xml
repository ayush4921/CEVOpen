<p>Some oil chemotypes like the estragole chemotype of basil (
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> L.) oil [
 <xref rid="B23-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] are toxic based on their estragole content which, in high concentrations, is carcinogenic and should be restricted during pregnancy and lactation [
 <xref rid="B88-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>,
 <xref rid="B89-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Dalmatian sage oil carries a combined risk from its camphor and thujone contents which makes it neurotoxic and embryotoxic [
 <xref rid="B36-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The oil should not be taken orally and its consumption is contraindicated in pregnancy and breastfeeding [
 <xref rid="B88-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. Ingestion of dalmatian sage oil can cause convulsions, seizure, coma, and may lead to death [

 <xref rid="B210-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">210</xref>]. Dalmatian sage oil (0.25%, 375 mg/kg for 2 weeks) negatively influenced the distribution of embryos according to nucleus number when fed to pregnant mice [
 <xref rid="B202-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">202</xref>]. Since the risks of dalmatian sage oil outweigh its benefits, it is best to avoid using it. Hibawood (
 <italic>Thujopsis dolabrata</italic> (L.f.) Siebold and Zucc.) EO may present a reproductive toxicity because of its β-thujaplicin content [
 <xref rid="B22-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In rats, orally delivered β-thujaplicin caused fetal malformations at 135 mg/kg and a decrease in fetal weight at 45 mg/kg [
 <xref rid="B211-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">211</xref>]. Nasturtium (
 <italic>Tropaeolum majus</italic> L.) flower absolute carries a moderate toxicity because of its benzyl cyanide content [
 <xref rid="B22-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].
