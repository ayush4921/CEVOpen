0: This review has been prepared based on a comprehensive survey of major scientific databases for the effects of some EOs and their constituents on the female reproductive system during pregnancy and on the development of the fetus.
1: Figure 1 presents the chemical structures of key essential oil components discussed in this review, while the chemical composition of these oils is summarized in  Table 1.
2: It should be noted that because of the ethical and safety issues in human toxicity testing, a substantial weight is usually given to animal testing for reproductive toxicity despite the major differences in reproductive physiologies.
3: EOs or components that showed animal reproductive toxicity should either be prohibited (strictly avoided) or restricted (used with some degree of caution) during pregnancy and lactation.
