<p>The female reproductive cycle involves a very complex sequence of changes in the uterus, ovaries, breasts, and regulatory hormone levels. Several mechanisms, metabolic pathways, and enzymes are involved in controlling and regulating reproductive hormone levels in the blood. During the reproductive cycle, these endogenous hormones are responsible for preparing for implantation and for milk production [

Out of concern of adversely affecting the unborn child, some pregnant women prefer to use herbs, herbal preparations, or oils rather than conventional medication to treat pregnancy-related symptoms (morning sickness, nausea, vomiting, heartburn, etc.) [

However, the use of herbs and EOs during pregnancy is a highly controversial matter. It is worth mentioning that it is the individual composition of an EO and the possible hazardousness of a single or a group of constituents that determine their medical and therapeutic usage. Some EO-containing plant species are highly variable and may produce several EO chemotypes with different EO compositions of which one or some chemotypes possess potential maternal reproductive toxicity. Causing abortion is a major concern. It is generally believed that EOs extracted from emmenagogic plants are dangerous or unsafe in pregnancy, as they might cause menstrual bleeding and lead to miscarriage. Yet, that is not always true. The oils do not necessarily carry the same activity as the whole plant. Regardless of their ability to promote menstruation, there is no decisive evidence that these oils are abortifacient in aromatherapy amounts. For instance, the whole plants of savin, pennyroyal, tansy, and rue can induce miscarriage and their oils were on the list of abortifacient oils at some point [

 <xref rid="B10-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Still, these facts do not prove the safety of these oils. Since the toxicity of many plants and EOs has not been studied yet, the concern cannot be completely dismissed.
