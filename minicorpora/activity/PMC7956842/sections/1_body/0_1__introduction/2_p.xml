<p>Another major concern about essential oils and their constituents is mimicking, interfering with, or antagonizing the action of reproductive hormones, which in turn could disrupt the reproductive and developmental processes [

 <xref rid="B12-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Since angiogenesis is essential for a successful pregnancy, anti-angiogenic oil constituents carry the risk of causing preeclampsia, growth restriction, and fetal death [

 <xref rid="B14-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Moreover, at high doses, teratogenic oils or components can cause birth defects of a structural nature that arise during embryonic development [
 <xref rid="B15-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Generally, EO components can cross the placenta to the fetal circulation due to their low molecular weight, protein binding ability, and lipophilicity and can cause fetotoxicity [
 <xref rid="B16-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Components that cross the placenta are more likely to affect the fetal central nervous system (CNS) since it is underdeveloped [
 <xref rid="B17-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Unsaturated compounds like cinnamaldehyde, citral, and Î²-pulegone act via interacting with the lipids in embryo cell membranes [

 <xref rid="B19-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Similar to crossing the placenta, most flavor and EO constituents are expected to pass into breast milk via passive diffusion [
 <xref rid="B20-ijms-22-02380" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In lactating mice, constituents of sandalwood oil were able to pass to maternal milk and affected infant hepatic metabolic enzymes [
