<p>Moreover, Spanish sage oil is a well-known abortifacient. Subcutaneously injected Spanish sage oil fraction (50% sabinyl acetate) into pregnant mice (at 15, 45, and 135 mg/kg on gestational days 6–15) caused abortion and maternal toxicity in a dose-dependent manner [

Since there is no established no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL), it is best to completely avoid sabinyl acetate-rich essential oils and any preparations containing them in pregnancy, especially during the first trimester.
