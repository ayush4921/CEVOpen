<p>The importance of medicinal plants is due to the great diversity of bioactive molecules with beneficial effect, as well as phenolic compounds, carotenoids, tocopherols, and vitamins. Due to their antioxidant properties, bioactive compounds are increasingly being studied for their beneficial effects against many chronic conditions, such as obesity, diabetes, and cancer [

 <xref rid="B17-molecules-25-05416" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Some bioactive compounds react slowly and need a long time to exert their antioxidant action. Moreover, the synergism between biomolecules in a mixture makes the target effect not only dependent on concentration, but also on the interaction between antioxidants [
