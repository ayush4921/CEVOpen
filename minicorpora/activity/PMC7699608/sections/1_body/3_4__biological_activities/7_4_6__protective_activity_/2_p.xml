<p>Saeed et al. (2014) evaluated the effect of low dose of 
 <italic>T. occidentalis</italic> on rabbit, for three months. They carried out an experiment on rabbits, on treated groups with and without tetrachloride. They analyzed the heart, liver, stomach, and kidney tissues histopathologically, on both control groups and 
 <italic>T. occidentalis</italic> treated groups. They also tested the CCl
 <sub>4</sub> injected group by doing the liver function test. Their study showed that there were minor harmful effects in the liver and kidney tissues which were treated with carbon tetrachloride, but there was no major toxicity due to the antioxidant effect of active constituents from 
 <italic>T. occidentalis</italic> [
