0: Plant products provide an alternative and successful source of lead compounds for the pharmaceutical industry.
1: The present study was aimed to evaluate, in cell-based assays, the antiviral properties of essential oils obtained from plants that commonly grow in Sardinia, Italy, against a broad spectrum of RNA/DNA viruses.
2: The essential oils of   Helichrisumitalicum (Roth) G. Don ssp.
3: microphyllum (Willd.)
4: Nyman,   Laurus nobilis L.,   Mirtuscommunis L.,   Pistacia lentiscus L.,   Salvia officinalis L.,   Saturejathymbra L.,   Lavandula angustifolia Mill.,   Foeniculum vulgare Mill., and   Eucalyptus globulus Labill.
5: were extracted by hydrodistillation and analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS).
6: Interestingly, the essential oil of   Salvia officinalis showed moderate activity against bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), an enveloped RNA virus belonging to the   Flaviviridae family.
7: BVDV is responsible for several clinical manifestations in bovines, including respiratory, gastroenteric, and reproductive diseases, with a significant economic impact.
8: With the aim to individuate the constituent of the   Salvia officinalis responsible for the biological activity, we tested the major components of the oil: camphene, -pinene, limonene, 1,8-cineole, cis-thujone, camphor, (E)-caryophyllene, and -humulene.
9: Here, we describe -humulene as an active component that is non-cytotoxic and active against BVDV (EC  50 = 36 M).
10: Its antiviral effects were evaluated using virucidal cytopathic effect inhibition and viral yield reduction assays.
11: This is the first scientific report showing the anti BVDV effects of   Salvia officinalis essential oil and -humulene as the main active component.
