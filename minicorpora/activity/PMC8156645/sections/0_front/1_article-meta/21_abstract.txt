0: The functional food market is growing with a compound annual growth rate of 7.9%.
1: Thai food recipes use several kinds of herbs.
2: Lemongrass, garlic, and turmeric are ingredients used in Thai curry paste.
3: Essential oils released in the preparation step create the flavor and fragrance of the famous tom yum and massaman dishes.
4: While the biological activities of these ingredients have been investigated, including the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial activities, there is still a lack of understanding regarding the responses to the essential oils of these plants.
5: To investigate the effects of essential oil inhalation on the brain and mood responses, electroencephalography was carried out during the non-task resting state, and self-assessment of the mood state was performed.
6: The essential oils were prepared in several dilutions in the range of the supra-threshold level.
7: The results show that   Litsea cubeba oil inhalation showed a sedative effect, observed from alpha and beta wave power reductions.
8: The frontal and temporal regions of the brain were involved in the wave alterations.
9: Garlic oil increased the alpha wave power at lower concentrations; however, a sedative effect was also observed at higher concentrations.
10: Lower dilution oil induced changes in the fast alpha activity in the frontal region.
11: The alpha and beta wave powers were decreased with higher dilution oils, particularly in the temporal, parietal, and occipital regions.
12: Both   Litsea cubeba and turmeric oils resulted in better positive moods than garlic oil.
13: Garlic oil caused more negative moods than the others.
14: The psychophysiological activities and the related brain functions require further investigation.
15: The knowledge obtained from this study may be used to design functional food products.
