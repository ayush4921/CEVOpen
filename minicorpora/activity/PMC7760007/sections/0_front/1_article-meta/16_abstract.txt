0: Essential oils are highly demanded substances worldwide.
1: They can be used without modification due to their different chemical and biological properties or as natural sources of chemical compounds.
2: The limit in the use of these metabolites is their low yield.
3: In the present investigation, the essential oil of fruits from   Dacryodes peruviana collected in the Ecuadorian Amazon was extracted and studied.
4: The essential oil was released from the plant matrix and isolated by hydrodistillation.
5: The yields obtained were 4.8  0.2% and 11.3  0.2% for fresh and dried fruits, respectively, one of the highest yields on record to date.
6: Twenty-five chemical compounds were identified by GC/MS and GC/FID techniques.
7: The principal constituent was -phellandrene, with 50.32  3.32%.
8: The antimicrobial activity of the oil was assayed against five Gram negative bacteria, two Gram positive bacteria and two fungi.
9: The essential oil exerted a moderate activity against   Staphylococcus aureus.
10: The repellent activity of the oil was assayed against mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae); the samples with 3%, 2% and 1% essential oil were class 4, and the sample with 0.5% showed to be class 3.
11: The essential oil showed a weak antioxidant activity through the DPPH and ABTS methods.
