0: AbstractThe genus   Stachys is a member of the Lamiaceae family.
1: These are important medicinal plants which grow all over the world and are known for their flavoring and therapeutic effects and   Stachys lavandulifolia is an endemic species of Iran.
2: To acquire highquality essential oil (EO), drying technique was implemented which is an essential part of this process.
3: The present study designed to evaluate the influences of different drying techniques (fresh sample, shade, sunlight, freezedrying, microwave, and ovendrying (40, 60, and 80C) on EO yield and composition of   S. lavandulifolia.
4: The results indicated that the maximum EO yield was obtained by the shadedrying method.
5: The main compounds found in the fresh samples were spathulenol, myrcene, pinene, cadinene, and muurolol, while spathulenol, cyrene, cadinene, pcymene, decane, terpinene, pinene, and intermedeol were found to be the dominant compounds in the dry samples.
6: Drying techniques were found to have a significant impact on the values of the main compositions, for example, monoterpene hydrocarbons such as pinene, pinene, myrcene, and phellandrene were significantly reduced by microwave drying, ovendrying (40, 60, and 80C), and sunlightdrying methods.
7: Drying techniques increased the antioxidant activity of   S. lavandulifolia EOs especially those acquired by freezedrying with the halfmaximal inhibitory concentration (IC  50) values 101.8  0.8 mg/ml in DPPH assay and 315.2  2.1 mg/ml in decreasing power assay.
8: As a result, shade, sun, and ovendrying (40C) were found to be the most important techniques for attaining maximum yields of EO.
