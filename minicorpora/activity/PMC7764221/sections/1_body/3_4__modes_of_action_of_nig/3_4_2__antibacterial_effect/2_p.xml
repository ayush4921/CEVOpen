<p>Multiple studies have investigated the antimicrobial effect of NS and TQ on different bacterial strains and species [
 <xref rid="B50-antioxidants-09-01260" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In numerous investigations TQ and NS compounds have displayed a significant bactericidal activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and inhibited bacterial biofilm formation [
 <xref rid="B62-antioxidants-09-01260" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,
 <xref rid="B94-antioxidants-09-01260" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>], encouraging the application of TQ as an antimicrobial agent in diverse diseases [
 <xref rid="B7-antioxidants-09-01260" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-antioxidants-09-01260" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. One of the suggested mechanisms of TQ-mediated bactericidal ability was the targeted ROS generation against bacterial cells [
 <xref rid="B94-antioxidants-09-01260" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>] with a simultaneous antioxidant and scavenging effect protecting the host tissues from oxidative stress [
 <xref rid="B79-antioxidants-09-01260" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Other studies observed a TQ-weakening effect on the integrity of bacterial membranes through pump efflux inhibition [
 <xref rid="B95-antioxidants-09-01260" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>], which might also play an important role decreasing the bacterial resistance if TQ treatment was combined with antibiotics [
 <xref rid="B96-antioxidants-09-01260" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. In the current investigation the reviewed studies reported in vivo and in vitro application of TQ and 
 <italic>NS</italic> extract on different species of periodontitis-associated bacteria. In two animal studies, investigators applied 0.2% TQ as oral gel [
 <xref rid="B62-antioxidants-09-01260" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,
 <xref rid="B64-antioxidants-09-01260" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] or systemically [
 <xref rid="B64-antioxidants-09-01260" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] on subgingival bacteria in rat gingivitis and periodontitis models. On microbiological assessment, TQ administration was observed in both studies to be sensitive against 
 <italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic>, 
 <italic>A. actinomycetemcomitans</italic> and 
 <italic>Prevotella intermedia</italic> and could decrease the number of subgingival bacteria significantly [

 <xref rid="B64-antioxidants-09-01260" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Recently, conforming in vitro studies tested the effect of TQ [
 <xref rid="B67-antioxidants-09-01260" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,
 <xref rid="B68-antioxidants-09-01260" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] and 
 <italic>NS</italic> [
 <xref rid="B69-antioxidants-09-01260" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] on the growth kinetics and activity [
 <xref rid="B69-antioxidants-09-01260" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], biofilm formation [
 <xref rid="B67-antioxidants-09-01260" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,
 <xref rid="B68-antioxidants-09-01260" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] and virulence [
 <xref rid="B68-antioxidants-09-01260" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] of periodontal-related bacterial species. Administration of 10% TQ showed significant effects on 
 <italic>Fusobacterium nucleatum</italic> and 
 <italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic>, as results showed inhibition of biofilm formation and hemolysis activities of both bacteria [
 <xref rid="B68-antioxidants-09-01260" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. TQ likewise repressed H
 <sub>2</sub>S production which is highly related with oral halitosis and disrupted bacterial membranes while reducing the expression of major virulence factors in both bacterial species [
 <xref rid="B68-antioxidants-09-01260" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. TQ application in 0.1% or 0.01% solutions equally affected the biofilm formation of 
 <italic>Fusobacterium nucleatum</italic> in a further investigation, as it indicated significant reduction of biofilm thickness and demonstrated a bacterial cleansing effect through TQ activity [
 <xref rid="B67-antioxidants-09-01260" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. In another in vitro evaluation of 
 <italic>NS</italic> extract antimicrobial properties, several microbial strains were isolated from the oral cavities of periodontitis patients [
 <xref rid="B69-antioxidants-09-01260" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. The antimicrobial activities of 
 <italic>NS</italic> were tested against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic>, 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, 
 <italic>Proteus</italic> sp., 
 <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii/ calcoaceticus</italic>, 
 <italic>Porphyromonas</italic> sp. and 
 <italic>Veillonella</italic> sp. [
 <xref rid="B69-antioxidants-09-01260" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. The analysis attained by the microdilution method displayed high antibacterial activities of the essential oil extract of 
 <italic>NS</italic> against all the observed species and mostly against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> and 
 <italic>Porphyromonas</italic> sp. Nevertheless, the agar well diffusion method did not reflect the exact results, proving that numerous factors may impact the antimicrobial action of 
 <italic>NS</italic> extracts [
