<p>Statistically significant higher bone losses were observed in the ligature-only group in comparison with the two other groups. On a histological basis, the same outcome was reported concerning the ratio of ICI to osteoclasts. Furthermore, osteoblasts presented lower activity in the ligature only group in comparison with the other groups. Consequently, the outcome concluded that oral administration of TQ assisted in the prevention and suppression of periodontal inflammation and reduced alveolar bone resorption. Moreover, a clinical randomized single-blind split-mouth trial [
 <xref rid="B65-antioxidants-09-01260" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] evaluated the efficiency of a periodontal chip impregnated with 2.5 mg TQ in periodontal treatment. Twelve male patients with periodontal pockets were distributed into three different groups: control (no treatment), plain chitosan-periodontal chips, and TQ-impregnated chips. Compared to the control and plain periodontal chip group the TQ treated patients displayed significant improvements in the clinical attachments and other clinical periodontal parameters. This result concluded the advice to use of TQ chips as an adjunctive periodontal treatment besides the scaling and root planning and for maintenance visits. Recently, further clinical studies were performed on periodontitis patients to evaluate the potential benefits of local application of thymoquinone gel as an adjunctive to regular periodontal treatment. One of these investigations selected 20 patients with 40 test sites and divided them into two groups. The first group was treated by scaling and root planning in addition to local application of 0.2% TQ gel, while patients of the second group were only treated by regular scaling and root planning [

After 6 weeks a statistically significant decrease was detected in PPD and GCF-ALP levels besides a rise in periodontal attachment levels in the TQ group in contrast to the regular periodontal therapy patients. Another similar trial was completed on 48 periodontitis patients with application of 0.1% TQ gel adjunctive to the regular scaling and root planning [
