<p>Inflammation and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been reported as major players in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease [
 <xref rid="B77-antioxidants-09-01260" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. In numerous investigations, NS and TQ have been discussed as anti-inflammatory [
 <xref rid="B78-antioxidants-09-01260" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>] and antioxidant mediators with curative effects [

 <xref rid="B80-antioxidants-09-01260" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Previous studies explained that TQ induces an antioxidant effect through the scavenging ability of various free radicals, being as effective scavenging superoxide anions analogous to superoxide dismutase [

 <xref rid="B78-antioxidants-09-01260" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. It reduces the levels of nitric oxide (NO) via reduction of iNOS mRNA production by macrophages and suppresses pro-inflammatory cytokines as IL-1b, IL-6, TNF-Î±, IFN-c and PGE2, simultaneous with an increase of the anti-inflammatory IL-10 [

 <xref rid="B83-antioxidants-09-01260" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. The possible mechanism by which TQ employs this combined anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant action might be associated to its aptitude to impede eicosanoid production. TQ and NS extracts have experimentally shown significant suppression of lipid peroxidation and eicosanoid generation, specifically, thromboxane B and leukotrienes B4, via inhibiting COX and LOX molecular pathways [
 <xref rid="B84-antioxidants-09-01260" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. Considering these potential properties anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties of TQ it may perform significant function to prevent the initiation and progression of periodontal disease as observed in the current review.
