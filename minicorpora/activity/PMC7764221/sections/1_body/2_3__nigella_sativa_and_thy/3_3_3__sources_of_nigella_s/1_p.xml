<p>NS seeds are the core natural source containing TQ compounds [

 <italic>Ranunculaceae</italic> plant family, considered a main source of NS seeds, other types of the 
 <italic>Lamiaceae</italic> family such as 
 <italic>Coridothymus, Agastache, Monarda, Origanum, Mosla, Satureja,</italic> and 
 <italic>Thymus</italic> were also described as possible sources for TQ extraction [

 <italic>Tetraclinis</italic> plants, as well as the 
 <italic>Cupressaceae</italic> family [
