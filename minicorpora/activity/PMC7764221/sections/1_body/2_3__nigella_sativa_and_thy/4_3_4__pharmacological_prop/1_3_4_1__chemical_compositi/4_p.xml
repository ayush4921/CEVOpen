<p>The chemical biosynthesis of TQ as a member of monoterpene compounds initiates in most species by cyclization of geranyl diphosphate and formation of 
 <italic>Î³</italic>-terpinene, that afterwards is aromatized into 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene and hydroxylated to carvacrol. Further hydroxylation of carvacrol occurs and allows the formation of thymohydroquinone. Thymohydroquinone then starts an oxidation process that finally leads to TQ formation [
