<p>The TQ concentration in the 
 <italic>Nigella sativa</italic> oil has been described to be between 18 and 25 µg/mL. In thermogravimetric analysis the thermal decomposition of TQ initiates at 65 °C and ends at 213 °C. Previous studies have reported that TQ is a member of the monoterpene class of natural complexes and displays keto-enol tautomerism [
