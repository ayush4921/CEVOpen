<p>As mechanical debridement of periodontal pockets and tissues is not always efficient enough to eliminate all microbes, residual bacteria in the periodontal environment can often recolonize the tissues after several weeks of therapy [
 <xref rid="B36-antioxidants-09-01260" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Consequently, adjunctive application of systemic chemotherapeutic antimicrobial agents besides the mechanical and surgical therapy has proven to be more effective in the complete eradication of the pathogens [
 <xref rid="B37-antioxidants-09-01260" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Although systemic administered antimicrobial therapy has revealed many positive effects in the periodontal treatment [

 <xref rid="B39-antioxidants-09-01260" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], it is generally prescribed only for rapidly progressing or refractory periodontitis due to its major simultaneous disadvantages [
 <xref rid="B26-antioxidants-09-01260" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Such drawbacks include for instance the unpredictable concentration of the antibiotic at the targeted site, a potential rapid decrease in plasma antibiotic concentration below the needed therapeutic index and a possible resistance development by the microorganisms against antibiotics [

 <xref rid="B39-antioxidants-09-01260" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. These mentioned potential disadvantages of systemic administered antimicrobial chemotherapeutics endorsed the development and investigation of localized intra-pocket drug delivery systems for periodontal therapy [
 <xref rid="B29-antioxidants-09-01260" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This localized drug delivery inside the periodontal pockets displayed less drug-related adverse effects, higher concentrations of the drug at the targeted site for extended periods of time and lead to better patient compliance [
 <xref rid="B26-antioxidants-09-01260" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The local drug delivery, required for antibacterial agents, as well as other types of chemotherapeutic mediators in periodontal treatment, can be administered by a localized application of therapeutic oral gels and solutions, or by an insertion of special delivery devices into the periodontal pockets, such as periodontal chips for a sustained release of the needed drug concentration facilitated by the gingival crevicular fluid [
