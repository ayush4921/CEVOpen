<p>Previous clinical and histological observations of periodontal disease have shown that periodontal tissue deterioration is initiated by microbiological plaque and bacterial toxins, besides the important factor of the host immune and inflammatory response to the pathogens [
 <xref rid="B30-antioxidants-09-01260" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. This major immune aspect of periodontal disease pathogenesis inspired the introduction of host modulatory therapy (HMT) to modify the host immune reaction and minimize the immune mediated destruction levels [
 <xref rid="B31-antioxidants-09-01260" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Several host modulatory mediators are available for chemotherapeutic periodontal treatment, adjunctive to the mechanical debridement by localized or systemic administration, for example doxycycline at sub-antimicrobial dose [
 <xref rid="B32-antioxidants-09-01260" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], anti-inflammatory drugs, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), steroids, anti-IL1 and anti-TNF [
 <xref rid="B33-antioxidants-09-01260" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], bisphosphonates, various growth factors [
 <xref rid="B34-antioxidants-09-01260" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and enamel matrix derivatives [
 <xref rid="B35-antioxidants-09-01260" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. These chemotherapeutic mediators share the ability to modulate the host-immune reaction by different mechanisms, eventually blocking the destructive characteristics of the inflammation [
 <xref rid="B31-antioxidants-09-01260" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Such mechanisms include the inhibition of prostaglandins and pro-inflammatory cytokines by anti-inflammatory agents, the suppression of collagenase by tetracyclines and doxycycline, as well as the reduced osteoclast cell activity mediated through bisphosphonates [
