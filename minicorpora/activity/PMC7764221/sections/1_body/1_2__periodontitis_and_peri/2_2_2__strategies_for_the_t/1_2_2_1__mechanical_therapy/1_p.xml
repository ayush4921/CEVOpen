<p>Dental plaque encompasses a combination of microorganisms, minerals and food deposits. As some plaque may harden into dental calculus, or may remain in hard reachable areas of the dentition, both dental deposits might not easily be removed by toothbrushing or flossing and can cause gingival inflammation, as a primary stage that develops afterwards to periodontal disease [

Through the measures of dental scaling, periodontists aim to remove soft and hard deposits, as well as stains from the crown and root surfaces of affected teeth [

Numerous clinical trials have designated that it diminishes the bacterial level inside periodontal pockets significantly and recovers clinical outcomes as levels of clinical attachment, bleeding on probing and probing depths [
