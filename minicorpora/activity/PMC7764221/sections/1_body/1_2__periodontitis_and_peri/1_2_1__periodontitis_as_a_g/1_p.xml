<p>Periodontitis can be described as an advanced destruction of the tooth-supporting structures of the oral cavity, including alveolar bone, cementum and periodontal ligaments. Its main action is revealed via loss of clinical periodontal attachments and radiographically measured loss of alveolar bone, leading to a clinical indication of periodontal pockets, gingival inflammation and bleeding. If periodontal disease remains untreated, it can terminate with tooth loss, however this condition is treatable and preventable if correct therapy is applied [

Owing to its high occurrence worldwide, periodontal disease presents a foremost problem of public health and health-related quality of life, as it can lead to tooth loss, masticatory and verbal disabilities, as well as esthetic and psychological complications. Periodontitis-related edentulism further accounts for significant dental care costs and presents a serious financial problem facing a large proportion of people worldwide [

As a chronic inflammatory and multifactorial condition linked to dental plaque biofilm dysbiosis, periodontitis is considered the most shared chronic inflammatory disease of all human societies. As explained by previous studies, the worldwide age-standardized occurrence of severe periodontitis in the last decade was nearly 11%, promoting periodontitis to be almost among the five most widespread conditions globally [

As periodontitis-linked edentulism plays a major role in the financial burden of dental diseases due to the replacement of lost teeth it causes significant increases in the total economic weight related to dentistry. The overall cost of dental conditions, was estimated recently to be of $544.41 billion with $356.80 billion direct expenses, as well as $187.61 billion indirect expenses [
