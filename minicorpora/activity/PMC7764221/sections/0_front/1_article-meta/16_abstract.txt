0: Thymoquinone (TQ), the chief active constituent of   Nigella sativa (NS), shows very valuable biomedical properties such as antioxidant, antimicrobial, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antihypertensive, hypoglycemic, antiparasitic and anti-asthmatic effects.
1: Several studies have examined the pharmacological actions of TQ in the treatment of oral diseases but its potential role in periodontal therapy and regeneration is not yet fully defined.
2: The present investigation has been designed to review the scientific studies about the effects of TQ as an adjunct to periodontal treatment to promote healing and periodontal regeneration.
3: Along with clinical experiments, in vitro studies exhibit the beneficial effects of TQ during periodontal therapy.
4: Nevertheless, additional comprehensive clinical and preclinical studies at cellular and molecular levels are essential to examine the particular action mechanisms of   Nigella sativa and its elements, particularly TQ, during periodontal treatment or regeneration.
