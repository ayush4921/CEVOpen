  <italic>Aniba rosaeodora</italic> is one of the most widely used plants in the perfumery industry, being used as medicinal plant in the Brazilian Amazon. This work aimed to evaluate the chemical composition of 
  <italic>A. rosaeodora</italic> essential oil and its biological activities. 
  <italic>A. rosaeodora</italic> essential oil presented linalool (93.60%) as its major compound. The 
  <italic>A. rosaeodora</italic> essential oil and linalool showed activity against all the bacteria strains tested, standard strains and marine environment bacteria, with the lower minimum inhibitory concentration being observed for 
  <italic>S. aureus</italic>. An efficient antioxidant activity of 
  <italic>A. rosaeodora</italic> essential oil and linalool (EC
  <sub>50</sub>: 15.46 and 6.78 µg/mL, respectively) was evidenced by the inhibition of the 2,2-azinobis- (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) radical. The antitrypanosomal activity of 
  <italic>A. rosaeodora</italic> essential oil and linalool was observed at high concentrations against epimatigote forms (inhibitory concentration for 50% of parasites (IC
  <sub>50</sub>): 150.5 ± 1.08 and 198.6 ± 1.12 µg/mL, respectively), and even higher against intracellular amastigotes of 
  <italic>T. cruzi</italic> (IC
  <sub>50</sub>: 911.6 ± 1.15 and 249.6 ± 1.18 µg/mL, respectively). Both 
  <italic>A. rosaeodora</italic> essential oil and linalool did not exhibit a cytotoxic effect in BALB/c peritoneal macrophages, and both reduced nitrite levels in unstimulated cells revealing a potential effect in NO production. These data revealed the pharmacological potential of 
  <italic>A. rosaeodora</italic> essential oil and linalool, encouraging further studies.
