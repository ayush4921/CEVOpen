<p>In the present study, 
 <italic>A. rosaeodora</italic> essential oil showed activity against epimastigote forms. Literature data showed anti-
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> activity in vitro in extracts and substances of different species of the 
 <italic>Aniba</italic> genus of plants collected in the Amazon [
 <xref rid="B29-antibiotics-10-00024" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], with promising antileishmanial activity [
 <xref rid="B14-antibiotics-10-00024" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. To understand whether linalool is responsible for the inhibitory activity, an analysis of linalool against epimastigote was performed. The results showed an inhibitory effect close to the values of 
 <italic>A. rosaeodora</italic> essential oil. Therefore, it is worth inferring that the inhibitory effect of the essential oil occurs due to the high concentration of linalool, or due to a possible synergistic and/or additive effect of the constituents of the essential oil acting as trypanocidal agents [
