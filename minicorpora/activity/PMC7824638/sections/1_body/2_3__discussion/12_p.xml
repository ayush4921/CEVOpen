<p>Literature data with 
 <italic>L. infantum chagasi</italic> determined that the post-interaction treatment with linalool has antiparasitic activity against intracellular amastigotes, inducing a decrease in the number of parasites within the macrophages [
 <xref rid="B36-antibiotics-10-00024" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In the same study, it was observed that linalool is capable of providing a drastic change in oxygen consumption, probably related to mitochondrial dysfunction. 
 <italic>P. aduncum</italic> essential oil rich in linalool induced mitochondria dysfunction altering the mitochondrial membrane potential of the T. cruzi epimastigote [
 <xref rid="B33-antibiotics-10-00024" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Mitochondrial alterations as swelling and important changes in the organization of nuclear and kinetoplastic chromatins were observed by electron microscopy when 
 <italic>L. amazonensis</italic> parasites were treated with 
 <italic>C. cajucara</italic> essential oil [
 <xref rid="B35-antibiotics-10-00024" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Linalool may interfere with the integrity of protozoan mitochondria, however, further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanism involved in the trypanocidal activity observed in our study.
