<p>The MIC of 
 <italic>A. rosaeodora</italic> essential oil resulted in concentrations lower than linalool. Holetz, et al. (2002) classifies samples that have MIC values below 100 μg/mL with good antibacterial activity; 100 to 500 μg/mL moderate; and 500 to 1000 μg/mL weak above 1000 μg/mL inactive [

 <italic>A. rosaeodora</italic> essential oil showed moderate activity, while linalool displayed weak activity. The difference between the activity of both compounds may be related to the synergistic effect of the compounds present in the essential oil of 
 <italic>A. rosaeodora</italic>. A synergistic interaction can be verified between the essential oils of 
 <italic>A. rosaeodora</italic> and 
 <italic>Pelargonium graveolens</italic> with gentamicin, and a very strong synergistic interaction against 
 <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> ATCC 19606 (fractional inhibitory concentration/FIC index = 0.11) [

(2018) found that linalool loaded in gold nanoparticles modified with glutathione (LIN-GNPs) has effective antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, proving that LIN-GNPs acted on the bacterial cell membrane, in giving up and increasing cell wall permeability and stimulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production that leads to bacterial nucleic acid damage [
