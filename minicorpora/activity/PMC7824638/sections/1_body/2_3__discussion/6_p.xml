<p>Biological activity may be directly related to phenolic compounds as they are good electron donors and therefore have efficient antioxidant activity among secondary plant metabolites. These compounds are capable of control oxidative damage generated by reactive oxygen species or radicals [
 <xref rid="B26-antibiotics-10-00024" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. We can also classify the antioxidant activity according to the excellent (IC
 <sub>50</sub> &lt; 15 µg/mL), good (15 µg/mL &lt; IC
 <sub>50</sub> &lt; 50 µg/mL), medium (50 µg/mL &lt; IC
 <sub>50</sub> &lt; 100 µg/mL), and weak activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> ≥ 100 µg/mL). 
 <italic>A. rosaeodora</italic> essential oil antioxidant activity was considered good while the linalool was optimal, corroborating with previous studies that verified excellent antioxidant activity of
