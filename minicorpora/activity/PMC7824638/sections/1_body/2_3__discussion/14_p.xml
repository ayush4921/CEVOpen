<p>Otherwise, in 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic>-stimulated cells the treatment with 
 <italic>A. rosaeodora</italic> essential oil or linalool did not significantly decrease nitrite levels. Linalool has a known anti-inflammatory activity [
 <xref rid="B38-antibiotics-10-00024" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and inhibits NO formation in vitro [
 <xref rid="B39-antibiotics-10-00024" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], but interestingly, an in vitro experiment of macrophages treated with linalool (250 or 350 Âµg/mL) for 24 h before or after interactions with the 
 <italic>Leishmania infantum</italic> was also not associated with any difference in NO production [
 <xref rid="B36-antibiotics-10-00024" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The inhibition of NO production observed in macrophages treated with 
 <italic>A. rosaeodora</italic> essential oil and linalool, although it is not associated with antitrypanosomal activity, is an interesting finding that should be better elucidated in further studies.
