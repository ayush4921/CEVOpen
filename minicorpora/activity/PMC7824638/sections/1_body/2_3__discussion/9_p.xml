<p>Previous data demonstrated that the IC
 <sub>50</sub>/24 h for linalool was 162.5 μg/mL for epimastigotes and 264 μg/mL for 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> trypomastigotes (Y strain) [

 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> (clone Dm28c) derived from cells, with IC
 <sub>50</sub>/24 h of 306 ng/mL, indicating that different forms and/or origin and different strains may differ in their susceptibility to essential oil derivatives [
