<p>The disk diffusion test carried out against standard strain bacteria and against bacteria isolated from a marine environment evidenced antibacterial activity, preliminarily. The mixed sensibility observed to the several antibiotics revealed the resistance pattern of marine environment bacteria. The sensibility observed to 
 <italic>A. rosaeodora</italic> essential oil and linalool showed that both compounds have activity against marine environment bacteria used in this study. It is known that the bacterial cell wall influences in an important way on the action of certain antibiotics. The difference between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial walls would be one of the responses to antibiotic resistance between two bacteria [
 <xref rid="B14-antibiotics-10-00024" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Bacterial resistance is best evidenced in environmental bacteria in the last few years. With the advent of modernization, an increasing amount of antibiotics was released into the environment along with the residues from domestic, industrial, agricultural and medical activities. This has ended up generating a selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria or genes in the environment, which threatens the efficiency of antibiotics in fighting bacterial infections [
