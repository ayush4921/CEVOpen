<p>The standard used in the development of the analytical methodology was linalool. Standard solutions of monoterpenes were prepared by dilution in absolute ethyl alcohol and chloroform at different concentrations. The essential oil of 
 <italic>A. rosaeodora</italic> was solubilized in ethyl acetate and was analyzed by a gas chromatograph Shimadzu QP 5000 (Shimadzu Corp., Kyoto, Japan), a column used with a capillary ZB-5 ms (5% phenyl arylene 95% dimethylpolysiloxane) coupled to 70 eV (40–500 Da) HP 5MS electronic impact detector with a transfer temperature of 280 °C. In the analysis, 0.3 μL of ethyl acetate and helium gas (99.99%) were injected at a temperature of 280 °C, using a split mode (1:10) with an initial temperature gradient of 40 to 300 °C.min
