 <italic>A. rosaeodora</italic> essential oil or linalool (1000–7.8 μg/mL) or benznidazole (200–0.78 μg/mL) up to a final volume of 100 μL per well. The controls were categorized as blanks (wells with culture medium without cells), untreated control (cells and DMSO 1%) and reference drug (benznidazole). After 72 h, the cell viability was analyzed by the MTT colorimetric method [
