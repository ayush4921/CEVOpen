<p>BALB/c peritoneal macrophages (5 × 10

 <sup>7</sup> parasites/mL) for 48 h. Nitrite quantification of the supernatant of the cells was performed with Griess reagent. Briefly, 50 µL of culture supernatant and 50 µL of Griess reagent (25 µL of sulfanilamide 1% in 2.5% H
 <sub>3</sub>PO
 <sub>4</sub> solution and 25 µL of N-(1-naphthyl)-ethylenediamine 0.1% solution) were added in 96-well plates. After incubation in a dark environment for 10 min, absorbance was obtained at 570 nm on the spectrophotometer. The nitrite values were obtained from the standard curve of sodium nitrite (100–1.5 µM) [
