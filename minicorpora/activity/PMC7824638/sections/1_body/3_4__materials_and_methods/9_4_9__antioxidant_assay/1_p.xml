<p>Antioxidant activity was assessed using a reaction mixture of 2,2-azinobis- (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) at 3840 μg/mL with 88 μL of 37,840 μg/mL potassium persulfate solution left in the dark at room temperature for 16 h giving rise to the ABTS radical which was diluted in ethanol to obtain an absorbance of 0.7 to 734 nm. The results were obtained in a dark environment, in which 30 µL of each concentration of essential oil (200 to 15 μg/mL) and eugenol (90 to 5 μg/mL) was transferred in test tubes containing 3.0 mL of the cation radical ABTS and homogenized on a tube shaker, and after 6 min the absorbance of the reaction mixture was read on a spectrophotometer at a length of 734 nm [

The analyses were carried out in triplicates and the determination of the activity was demonstrated as percentage of inhibition (% I) of the ABTS radical cation according to the equation: % inhibition = (absorbance of the solution of the radical ABTS—absorbance of the sample)/(solution of ABTS absorbance radical) × 100 [
