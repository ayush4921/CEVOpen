<p>Epimastigote forms of 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic>, from a 2- to 4-day-old culture were incubated for 24 h in the absence or in the presence of different concentrations (1000–15.625 µg/mL) of 
 <italic>A. rosaeodora</italic> essential oil or linalool, obtained by serial dilutions (1:2), at a final volume of 100 µL per well. The controls were identified as blank (wells without parasites), untreated control (parasites and DMSO 1%) and reference drug (benznidazole). Incubation took place in a 96-wells plate, in a BOD incubator at 28 °C in LIT medium using a parasite concentration of 10
 <sup>6</sup> promastigotes/mL. After 24 h, with the aid of the Neubauer chamber and light microscopy [
 <xref rid="B46-antibiotics-10-00024" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], viability was evaluated by counting parasites and the results were used to calculate the IC
 <sub>50</sub> (50% inhibition of parasite growth) following the formula: IC
 <sub>50</sub> = (sample counting)/(control counting) ×100 [
