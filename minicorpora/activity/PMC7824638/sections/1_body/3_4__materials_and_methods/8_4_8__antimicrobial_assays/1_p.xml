<p>During the preliminary test of diffusion in solid medium, 100 μL of inoculum of each bacterium sown on Mueller–Hinton agar plates were used, and on the agar surface, a paper disc impregnated with 50 μL of essential oil of 
 <italic>A. rosaeodora</italic>, standard linalool or reference drugs were added; then the plates were incubated at 35 °C and after 24 h the inhibition zone was measured with a millimeter rule [
 <xref rid="B42-antibiotics-10-00024" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The MIC was also performed according to the broth dilution methodology performed in triplicate with the same bacteria used in the diffusion tests in solid medium [
 <xref rid="B41-antibiotics-10-00024" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Initially, serial dilutions were performed resulting in concentrations of 5–1000 μg/mL of 
 <italic>A. rosaeodora</italic> essential oil, linalool or reference drugs and transferred to a test tube containing Mueller-Hinton broth. To each concentration, 100 μL of the microbial suspension containing 1.5 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/mL were added and subsequently incubated at 35 °C for 24 h. It was also reserved control of broth sterility and bacterial growth. After the incubation period, the MIC was determined, being defined as the lowest concentration that visibly inhibited bacterial growth (absence of visible turbidity). To confirm growth inhibition, the broth was subjected to the microbial seeding test of the inoculum on the surface of the plate-count agar.
