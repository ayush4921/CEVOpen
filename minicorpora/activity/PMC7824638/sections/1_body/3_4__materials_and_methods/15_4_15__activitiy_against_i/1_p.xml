<p>BALB/c peritoneal macrophages cultured in 24-well plates (5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well), with coverslips, were infected with trypomastigote forms of 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic>, obtained from cultured Vero cells, using the ratio of parasite/cell 10:1, at 37 °C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 6 h. After incubation, well plates were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2) to remove the non-internalized parasites. The infected cells were treated with different concentrations of 
 <italic>A. rosaeodora</italic> essential oil or linalool (1000–31.25 µg/mL), or benzonidazole (100–6.25 µg/mL) for 24 h. The amastigotes couting by analysis of light microscopy were carried out to determine the IC
 <sub>50</sub> calculation. Selectivity index were obtained from the relationship of macrophage cytotoxicity and antiamastigote activity. Parameters of infection analysis were performed according to Teles et al. [
