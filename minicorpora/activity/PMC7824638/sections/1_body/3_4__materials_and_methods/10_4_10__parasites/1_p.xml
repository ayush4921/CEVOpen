<p>Parasite cultures employed in this study were 
 <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> (SC2005 strain). Trypomastigote forms were obtained from Vero cells infected and used to infect the macrophages. Epimatigote forms were originated from the suspension of cell culture trypomastigotes in 3 mL of liver infusion tryptose (LIT) medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/mL of penicillin and 100 μg/mL of streptomycin), and incubated in an oven at 28 °C until complete differentiation of parasites.
