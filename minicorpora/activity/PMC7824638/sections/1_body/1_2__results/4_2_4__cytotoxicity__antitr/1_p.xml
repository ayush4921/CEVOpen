<p>The activity of 
 <italic>A. rosaeodora</italic> essential oil and linalool was evaluated against the epimastigote and intracellular amastigote forms of 
 <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic>, as well as its cytotoxic effect against mammal cells. Both compounds presented concentration-dependent inhibitory activity against epimastigote and intracellular amastigote forms of 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-10-00024-f004">Figure 4</xref>). The inhibitory concentration for 50% of parasites (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) values for epimastigote forms was lower for 
 <italic>A. rosaeodora</italic> essential oil than linalool. Analyzing the activity against different forms of the 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic>, 
 <italic>A. rosaeodora</italic> essential oil exhibited IC
 <sub>50</sub> value against epimastigote 6.0-fold higher in comparison to the IC
 <sub>50</sub> against intracellular amastigotes forms. In contrast, linalool was 3.65-fold more effective against 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> intracellular amastigote when compared to 
 <italic>A. rosaeodora</italic> essential oil. Both compounds presented higher IC
 <sub>50</sub> values when compared to benznidazole. Cytotoxicity assay revealed that 
 <italic>A. roseadora</italic> essential oil and linalool not showed toxicity for BALB/c peritoneal macrophages even at the highest concentration analyzed (1000 Î¼g/mL). Thus, linalool exhibited higher SI value than 
 <italic>A. roseadora</italic> essential oil (
