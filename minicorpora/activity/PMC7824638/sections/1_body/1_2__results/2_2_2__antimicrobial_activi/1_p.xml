<p>Bacteria from the marine environment were evaluated by the disc-diffusion method against 
 <italic>A. rosaeodora</italic>, linalool and several reference antibiotics (
 <xref rid="antibiotics-10-00024-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The bacteria culture displayed inhibition halos ranging from 7 to 25 mm, besides the non-inhibition presented in some cultures. Comparing linalool with 
 <italic>A. rosaeodora</italic> essential oil, we found that 
 <italic>A. rosaeodora</italic> was more efficient against 
 <italic>Aeromonas caviae</italic> and 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> than the standard linalool. Linalool exhibited greater activity against 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumonia</italic> and 
 <italic>Providencia stuartii</italic> than 
 <italic>A. rosaeodora</italic> essential oil, while both compounds presented the same activity against 
 <italic>Aeromonas hydrophila</italic>. The susceptibility test performed with antibiotics showed that 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic> was the strain that presented sensibility for all the antibiotics analyzed, while the other four strains displayed mixed sensibility to the antibiotics.
