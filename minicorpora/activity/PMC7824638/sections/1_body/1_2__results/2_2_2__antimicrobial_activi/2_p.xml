<p>The preliminary antibacterial activity against standard strain bacteria evaluated by the disc-diffusion method showed a growth inhibitory halo on 
 <italic>A. rosaeodora</italic> essential oil and linalool disks against Gram-positive (
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>) and Gram-negative strains (
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> sp.) (
 <xref rid="antibiotics-10-00024-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Gram-positive bacteria exhibited the highest inhibition halo from both essential oil and linalool. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 
 <italic>A. rosaeodora</italic> essential oil ranged from 250 to 450 Î¼g/mL against the tested strains. As observed in the disc-diffusion method, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> was the strain more sensible to 
 <italic>A. rosaeodora</italic> essential oil and linalool activity by MIC analysis. Likewise, both methodologies showed that 
 <italic>A. rosaeodora</italic> essential oil presented better antimicrobial activity than linalool to all strains analyzed.
