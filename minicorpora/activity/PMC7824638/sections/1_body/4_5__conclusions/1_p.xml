<p>The essential oil of 
 <italic>A. rosaeodora</italic> showed activity against all the strains tested, with a lower minimum inhibitory concentration being observed for 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. An efficient antioxidant activity of the essential oil was evidenced by the ABTS radical discoloration technique, fully inhibiting the radical in relatively low concentrations. These results point to an important potential for use as an antimicrobial and antioxidant agent. The antitrypanosomal activity of 
 <italic>A. rosaeodora</italic> essential oil and linalool were observed at high concentrations against epimatigote forms, and even higher against intracellular amastigotes of 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic>. Both 
 <italic>A. rosaeodora</italic> essential oil and linalool reduced nitrite levels in unstimulated cells revealing a potential effect in NO production. These data revealed the pharmacological potential of the 
 <italic>A. rosaeodora</italic> essential oil and linalool, which encourage further studies.
