<p>The antimicrobial activity of the CA_EO and LS_EO are shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05600-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The CA_EO was the most effective against 
 <italic>S. aureus, E. coli, C. albicans and H. pylori</italic> with inhibition zones of 25, 8, and 15 mm (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05600-f001">Figure 1</xref>), respectively and complete inhibition at the same concentration against 
 <italic>H. pylori</italic>. The essential oil was shown to have antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> was slightly less than that against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) at the same concentration. The MICs of the CA_EO against the bacteria mentioned above were 19.0, 36.0, 31.0, and 30.0 μg/mL respectively, and LS_EO against the bacteria mentioned above were 64.0 μg/mL.
