0: In Chile, research on antimicrobial compounds obtained from native plants has yielded some positive results in the antimicrobial activity [ 1].
1: Moreover, Bittner [ 8] has evaluated the fungistatic activity of EO extracted from CA_EO and LS_EO against fungi such as  Rhizoctonia solani Kuhn (Donk) and  Fusarium oxysporum Schltdl.
2: Additionally, Avello [ 9] evaluated the antifungal activity of EOs extracted from canelo, queule, bailahuen and culen against other phytopathogenic fungi, such as  Botritys cinerea,  Fusarium oxysporum and  Aspergillus niger.
3: Additionally, we have identified the major active compounds as well as evaluated the effects of the CA_EO against  N. ceranae and its potential use for the control of nosemosis disease [ 10].
