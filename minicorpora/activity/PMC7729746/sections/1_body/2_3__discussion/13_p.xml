<p>The CA_EO showed some level of toxicity at the highest concentrations (50–3.125 mg/mL) higher than those recommended for studies in 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> (1 mg/mL), Forno [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-25-05600" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], demonstrating that this oil presented low or no toxicity. Similar to what was reported Larrazabal [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-25-05600" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], using oils from 
 <italic>Rica rica</italic> and 
 <italic>Copa copa</italic> showed low toxicity in 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Other studies reported marginal toxicity of EO obtained from 
 <italic>Amomum subulatum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-25-05600" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. On the other hand, tests with LS_EO showed high toxicity in all concentrations used against 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> (50–0.39 mg/mL). Similarly, Enam [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-25-05600" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] reported nematocidal activity against 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> of 
 <italic>thymol</italic> and 
 <italic>p-cymene</italic>, ratified by Isman [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-25-05600" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], reported a high toxicity effect of
