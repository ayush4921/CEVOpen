<p>In the current study, the differences in the yield and composition of the CA and LS_EOs compared to those in the literature, could be due to both the extraction method and the collection time [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-25-05600" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The chemical composition of the oils affects their bioactivity [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-25-05600" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], even though their bioactivity should not be attributed to a particular compound [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-25-05600" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Biological effects are the result of a synergism of all molecules contained in an EO even if it is possible that the activity of the main component is modulated by other minor molecules. The activity of the isolated constituents, however, is also notable [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-25-05600" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Previously we demonstrated the CA_EO antifungal activity against 
 <italic>Nosema ceranae</italic> [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-25-05600" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Some of the compounds found in this work such as eucalyptol, (one of the major compounds in CA_EO) has been reported in other EOs included 
 <italic>Acantholippia deserticola</italic> and demonstrated inhibition of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-25-05600" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Eucalyptol was ascertained in 
 <italic>P. boldus</italic> and 
 <italic>L. philippiana</italic> EO antifungal activity against 
 <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> Schltdl [
