<p>To evaluate the dose-response at given concentrations and the time-course of Eos, the cells where detached with Trypsin-EDTA 0.5% (Gibco, USA) and 5 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> cells/well were seeded and incubated in a 96-well cell plate with DMEM-F12 supplemented with 10% FBS for 24 h. The supernatant were removed and the cells were washed 1× with PBS 1X (Gibco, USA), and treated with EOs extracts of CA or LS at known concentrations (64, 32, 16, 8, 4, or 2 µg/mL) dissolved in culture medium (DMEM-F12 supplemented with 1% FBS). The vehicle was DMSO 1% dissolved in DMEM-F12, supplemented with 1% FBS as a control treatment (the EOs are dissolved in DMSO 1%). After 24 or 48 h the supernatant was discarded, the cells were washed with PBS 1X and incubated with 100 µl of crystal violet (CV) solution (0.2%
