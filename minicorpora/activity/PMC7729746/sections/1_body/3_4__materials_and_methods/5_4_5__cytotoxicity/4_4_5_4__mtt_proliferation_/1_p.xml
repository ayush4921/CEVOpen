<p>To evaluate the dose-response at given concentrations of EOs, 5 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> cells/well were seeded and incubated in a 96-well cell plate with DMEM-F12 10% FBS for 24 h. The cells were treated with EOs extracts at known concentrations (64, 32, 16 µg/mL) dissolved in culture medium (DMEM 1% FBS) or control medium (DMSO 1% in DMEM 1% FBS). After 24 or 48 h the supernatant was discarded and MTT solution was added to each well, according to the manufacturer’s recommendation. The cells were incubated in dark at 37 °C for 2 h. After that, the MTT solution was removed and acidified isopropanol (4% of HCl 1N) was added. The absorbance of each sample was measured at 570 nm. The results are shown as the percentage of color intensity and normalized to cells grown in DMSO 1% as control treatment.
