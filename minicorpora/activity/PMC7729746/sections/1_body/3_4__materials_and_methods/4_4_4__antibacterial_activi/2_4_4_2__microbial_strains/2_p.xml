<p>Seven 
 <italic>H. pylori</italic> (HP) strains were selected from a collection of clinical isolates from the Laboratorio Patogenesis Microbiana, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Diego Portales, Santiago, Chile. The HP strains were routinely cultured on 1.5% Brucella agar (from BD, USA) supplemented with 5–7% horse blood and DENT cocktail diluted 1:200 and were incubated for 3–7 days under microaerophilic conditions (10% CO
 <sub>2</sub>) and 95% humidity at 37 °C. The 
 <italic>HP</italic> strains were confirmed by colony morphology, Gram staining, the urease test (He-Py Test, GrupoBios, Chile) and positive PCR using primers for the 
 <italic>H. pylori</italic>-specific 
 <italic>hpaA</italic> gene, which has been previously described (Bergozelli et al., 2003). 
 <italic>HP</italic> strain HPK5 was used as a pathogen reference [
