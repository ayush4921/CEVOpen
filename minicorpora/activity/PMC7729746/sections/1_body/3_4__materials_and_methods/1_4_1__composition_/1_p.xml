<p>Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis was performed on a Varian gas chromatograph series 431 (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) fitted with a DB-5 ms fused silica capillary column (30 × 0.25 mm; film thickness, 0.25 μm) using split/split-less injection and coupled to a series 220 mass detector (Agilent Technologies, Inc.). The following conditions were used: injection volume: 0.8 μL with split ratio 1:80; helium as a carrier gas at 1.5 mL/min in constant flow; injector temperature: 250 °C; oven temperature: 50–260 °C at 2 °C/min. The mass spectra electron impact (EI+) mode was set at 70 eV, with an ion source temperature of 260 °C. The mass spectra were recorded within a range of 40–300 atomic mass units. Identification of the EO constituents was accomplished based on the following: the retention index (RI) determined with respect to a homologous series of
