<p>The FRAP assay was carried out with the following method [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-25-05600" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The FRAP reagent consisted of 300 mM acetate buffer pH 3.6, 10 mM 2,4,6-
 <italic>tris</italic>-(2-pyridyl)-s-triazine (TPTZ) solution in 40 mM HCl, and 20 mM FeCl
 <sub>3</sub>·6H
 <sub>2</sub>O aqueous solution at a ratio of 10:1:1 (

 <italic>v</italic>). The EOs were prepared at a final concentration of 500 μg/mL. The extract solution (10 μL) was mixed with 70 μL of freshly prepared FRAP solution and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The absorbance of the solutions was measured at 593 nm. Trolox was used as the standard solution to construct a calibration curve over a concentration range of 0–500 μg/mL. The FRAP results were expressed as mg of Trolox equivalent per mL of EO. All experiments were performed in triplicate.
