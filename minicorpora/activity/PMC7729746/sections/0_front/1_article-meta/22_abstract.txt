0: Cryptocarya alba (Peumo; CA) and   Laurelia sempervirens (Laurel; LS) are herbs native to the Chilean highlands and have historically been used for medicinal purposes by the Huilliches people.
1: In this work, the essential oils were extracted using hydrodistillation in Clevenger apparatus and analyzed by GC-MS to determine their composition.
2: The antioxidant capacity (AC) was evaluated in vitro.
3: The cytotoxicity was determined using cell line cultures both non tumoral and tumoral.
4: The toxicity was determined using the nematode   Caenorhabditis elegans.
5: The antimicrobial activity was evaluated against 52 bacteria using the agar disc diffusion method and the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined.
6: The principal compounds found in   C. alba essential oil (CA_EO) were -terpineol (24.96%) and eucalyptol (21.63%) and were isazafrol (91.9%) in   L. sempervirens essential oil (LS_EO).
7: Both EOs showed antioxidant capacity in vitro.
8: Both EO showed antibacterial activity against bacteria using.
9: LS_EO showed more inhibitory effect on these cell lines respect to CA_EO.
10: Both EOs showed toxicity against the nematode   C.elegans at 3.1250 mg/mL.
11: The essential oils of CA and LS have an important bioactive potential in their antioxidant, antibacterial and cytotoxicity activity.
12: Both essential oils could possibly be used in the field of natural medicine, natural food preservation, cosmetics, sanitation and plaguicides among others.
