 <caption> Dose-response curve of the human epithelial renal non-tumor cell line (HK2, a– d) and tumor cells line ((786-O, b– e) and (ACHN, c– f)), treated with CA or LS EOs. The graph bar corresponds to the proliferation of Hk2, 786-O and ACHN, treated with the EOs at different concentrations versus control (DMSO 1%) for 48 h, evaluated by CV assay at 570 nm. Three independent trials were performed, in triplicate, for each treatment and concentration. * p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.005, *** p &lt; 0.001. </caption>
