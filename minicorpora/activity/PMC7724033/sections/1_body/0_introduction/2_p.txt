0: Traditional Persian Medicine (TPM) is one of the most ancient medical doctrines mostly known through manuscripts by Persian scientists such as  The Canon of Medicine by Avicenna and  The Great Continens by  Rhazes ( Hamedi et al., 2013).
1: Additionally, TPM owes several other scientists with valuable manuscripts regarding anatomy and physiology, disease diagnosis, surgery instruments, and single and compound natural medicines ( El-Seedi et al., 2019).
2: TPM has several recommendations for the management of organ damage due to various infections.
3: One of the main approaches in the primary and secondary treatment of diseases in TPM is to protect the four body humors, which are blood, phlegm, bile, and melancholy, from infection ( Emtiazy et al., 2012;  Kopaei et al., 2016).
4: Many types of infections or the so-called humor infections with different clinical manifestations have been described in TPM manuscripts and textbooks, some of which have similar features to that of SARS-CoV-2.
5: One of the pathological conditions explained in TPM for the humors is humor excitation which is equivalent to the activation of inflammatory pathways ( Aghili Khorasani, 1771).
