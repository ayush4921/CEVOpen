0: An examination of pathological conditions similar to COVID-19 along with the therapeutic approaches that are described in TPM manuscripts could pave the way for designing a series of natural products for the management of SARS-CoV-2 infection and related complications ( Siahpoosh, 2020).
1: Taking concepts from TPM to treat severe infective pulmonary disorders can help us to select medicinal plants that are potentially useful for SARS-CoV-2 ( Kenari et al., 2018).
2: The TPM approach includes lifestyle modifications, along with the administration of some medicinal plants to modify the quality and quantity of the four humors from a pathologic situation into the physiologic condition.
3: The main organs affected in COVID-19 are the lung, heart, and kidney ( Su et al., 2020;  Zheng et al., 2020).
4: Accordingly, another approach, which extracts TPM suggestions for the management of the disease is to focus on the natural agents that are specifically recommended as a tonic for these three organs.
5: A tonic, e.g.
6: a cardiotonic medicine, in TPM is defined as a medicine by which an ideal condition is provided for the physiological functions of an organ so that it is less vulnerable to the pathological conditions ( Aghili Khorasani, 1771).
7: This study aims to introduce some of the medicinal plants that TPM claims are effective in the management of symptoms similar to COVID-19 and present current evidence on their efficacy.
