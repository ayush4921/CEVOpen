0: Coronavirus 2019 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new member of the Coronaviridae family which has caused a global outbreak of a disease called COVID-19 ( Wu et al., 2020).
1: Despite the current pharmacotherapies, including different antiviral agents used for the management of hospitalized patients like remdesivir, lotinavir, ritonavir, and ribavirin, a growing number of deaths still occur all over the world ( World Health Organization (2020) situation report 197) which has made scientists seek better therapeutic agents.
2: Plants have always been an important source of medicinal ingredients, including antiviral agents ( Lin et al., 2014;  Bahramsoltani et al., 2016).
3: Although there is no approved drug for this disease, it is worth mentioning that oseltamivir (Tamiflu), an antiviral agent currently used in some SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, is based on shikimic acid from  Illicium verum Hook.f.
4: (star anise) fruit as the precursor ( Patra et al., 2020).
5: Additionally, the clinical effectiveness of several medicinal plants such as licorice and garlic has been demonstrated in the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS) epidemics ( Xiu-hui et al., 2003;  Chen and Nakamura, 2004;  Cui et al., 2020).
6: A dramatic reduction of mortality from 52% to 1-4% was observed during the SARS epidemic in Beijing due to the addition of Traditional Chinese Medicine to conventional therapies ( Chen and Nakamura, 2004).
7: Thus, plant-derived natural agents provide a valuable list of compounds with possible antiviral properties against SARS-CoV-2 which can be the focus of future investigations.
8: Furthermore, the use of complementary and alternative medicine, including different traditional medicines, can be cost-saving and decrease the prescription of conventional drugs, providing further reasons for scientists to undertake studies on natural products ( World Health Organization (2013) WHO traditional medicine strategy: 2014-2023).
