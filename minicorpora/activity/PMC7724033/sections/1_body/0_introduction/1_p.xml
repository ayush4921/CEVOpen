<p>Coronavirus 2019 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new member of the Coronaviridae family which has caused a global outbreak of a disease called COVID-19 (
 <xref rid="B154" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). Despite the current pharmacotherapies, including different antiviral agents used for the management of hospitalized patients like remdesivir, lotinavir, ritonavir, and ribavirin, a growing number of deaths still occur all over the world (
 <xref rid="B153" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization (2020)</xref> situation report 197) which has made scientists seek better therapeutic agents. Plants have always been an important source of medicinal ingredients, including antiviral agents (

Additionally, the clinical effectiveness of several medicinal plants such as licorice and garlic has been demonstrated in the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS) epidemics (

Thus, plant-derived natural agents provide a valuable list of compounds with possible antiviral properties against SARS-CoV-2 which can be the focus of future investigations. Furthermore, the use of complementary and alternative medicine, including different traditional medicines, can be cost-saving and decrease the prescription of conventional drugs, providing further reasons for scientists to undertake studies on natural products (
