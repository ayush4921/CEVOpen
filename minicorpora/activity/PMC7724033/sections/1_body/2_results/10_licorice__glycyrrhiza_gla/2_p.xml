<p>Licorice is a well-studied plant in terms of its antiviral activity (
 <xref rid="B148" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). In addition to its remarkable antiviral properties against some RNA-viruses like HCV and HIV (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Adianti et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Fukuchi et al., 2016</xref>), licorice has demonstrated remarkable antiviral effects on respiratory viruses. Glycyrrhizin has shown a high inhibitory effect on the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> replication of two clinical isolates of SARS (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Cinatl et al., 2003</xref>). Accordingly, fifteen semisynthetic derivatives of this compound were virtually screened against the virus. Glycoside, amide, and carboxyl moieties can significantly increase the activity in comparison to the original backbone; however, the cytotoxicity was also increased in these new structures (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Hoever et al., 2005</xref>). In influenza A H5N1-infected lung cells, glycyrrhizin inhibited both viral replication and host cell inflammatory and apoptotic response to the infection, a condition responsible for severe flu symptoms (
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">Michaelis et al., 2011</xref>). In silico analysis has demonstrated the ability of twelve licorice components to inhibit influenza neuraminidase (NA), a viral surface enzyme involved in the release of replicated viruses from infected host cells (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Grienke et al., 2014</xref>). Aqueous licorice extract, glycyrrhizin, and one of its metabolites, 18β-glycyrrhetinic acid were investigated against human RSV. While the extract and 18β-glycyrrhetinic acid revealed significant antiviral activity, glycyrrhizin was inactive (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Feng Yeh et al., 2013</xref>). This observation forms the hypothesis that glycyrrhizin acts as a pro-drug which turns into active metabolites such as 18β-glycyrrhetinic acid but future investigations are required to examine this idea.
