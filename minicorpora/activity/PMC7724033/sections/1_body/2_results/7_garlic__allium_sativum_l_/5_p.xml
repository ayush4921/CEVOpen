<p>Garlic is also widely used for different cardiologic problems and myocardial protection (

 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Abdel-Daim et al., 2017</xref>). Allicin is produced from alliin by alliinase after chopping garlic and is further metabolized into diallyl trisulfide. The latter compound has exerted cardioprotective effects through AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), GSK-3β, and hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF)-1α (
 <xref rid="B159" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2017</xref>). Considering the doses of alliin, allicin, diallyl trisulfide (20, 100 mg/kg) versus garlic homogenate (250 mg/kg), it can be hypothesized that the purified compounds are more potent than garlic. However, a study on all of these components in the same setting is required to clarify this hypothesis.
