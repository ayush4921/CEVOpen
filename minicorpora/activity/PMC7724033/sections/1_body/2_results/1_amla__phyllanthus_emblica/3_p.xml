<p>In addition to the direct antiviral activity of amla which can suggest natural molecular backbones for possible antiviral agents against SARS-COV-2, there are several reports on the protective effects of the plant on the main organs damaged in SARS-COV-2 infection (

The compound could significantly prevent bacterial pulmonary inflammation, evident from the reduced production of neutrophil chemokines, pro-inflammatory interleukins (IL), and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, an important contributor in leukocyte chemotaxis (
