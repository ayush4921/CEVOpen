 <italic>R. palmatum</italic> extract has demonstrated antiviral activity against CVB3, the main reason for viral myocarditis. Interestingly, the viral titers in the internal organs of infected animals treated with 0.3 g/kg of the extract were lower than those that received 0.01 g/kg ribavirin as the gold standard. Serum viral RNA was not detected on the last day of the experiment in the extract-treated group; while it remained positive in the ribavirin group (

 <italic>R. palmatum</italic> and 
 <italic>R. officinale</italic>, were assessed against HIV infection. The compounds were assessed regarding their inhibitory effects on three main HIV-1 enzymes, i.e. reverse transcriptase (RT)-associated DNA polymerase (RDDP), integrase, and ribonuclease H (RNase H). 
 <italic>R. officinale</italic> extract and sennoside A showed a higher potency toward the inhibition of viral RNase H. Additionally, sennoside A had a lower IC
 <sub>50</sub> for RDDP and integrase, showing a higher activity against viral replication which was also confirmed in the cell-based assay (
