<p>A recent study has reported that 
 <italic>Ageratum conyzoides</italic> L. leaves extract containing quercetin actively inhibited TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> during the inflammation process by degrading the collagenase of cartilage as well as the matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> is a cytokine inflammatory agent involved in osteoarthritis, which can be worsening inflammatory status in a blood vessel wall by inducing the endothelial cell damage, regulating the leucocyte activity, and releasing the cytokine as well as chemokine proinflammatory agent [

 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. MMP is classified into five major groups according to their substrate specificity which is collagenase (MMP-1, 8, and 13), gelatinase (MMP-2 and 9), stromelysin (MMP-3, 10, 11, and 19), matrilysin (MMP-7, 12, and 18), and membrane-bound MMP (MMP-1 and 4) [
