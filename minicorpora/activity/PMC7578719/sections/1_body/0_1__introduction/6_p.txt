0: A recent study has reported that  Ageratum conyzoides L. leaves extract containing quercetin actively inhibited TNF-  during the inflammation process by degrading the collagenase of cartilage as well as the matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9).
1: TNF-  is a cytokine inflammatory agent involved in osteoarthritis, which can be worsening inflammatory status in a blood vessel wall by inducing the endothelial cell damage, regulating the leucocyte activity, and releasing the cytokine as well as chemokine proinflammatory agent [ 44].
2: MMP-9 is a zinc-dependent peptidase, a member of MMP superfamily [ 45].
3: MMP is classified into five major groups according to their substrate specificity which is collagenase (MMP-1, 8, and 13), gelatinase (MMP-2 and 9), stromelysin (MMP-3, 10, 11, and 19), matrilysin (MMP-7, 12, and 18), and membrane-bound MMP (MMP-1 and 4) [ 46,  47].
