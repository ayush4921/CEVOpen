<p>The chromene compounds studied as an analgesic drug are corresponding with its 
 <italic>in silico</italic> prediction in which precocene I, precocene II, and VMDC performed relatively good energy bindings in cox-2. Furthermore, polymethoxyflavone studied as anti-inflammatory agents is exhibiting better binding energy with cox-2 than chromene and other ligands. Flavonoids such as polymethoxyflavone also were studied as an antibacterial against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> which could be due to the 4-diphosphodicytidyl-2-C-methylerythritol synthase inhibition. In contrast, the interaction of pyrrolizidine alkaloids with ornithine delta-aminotransferase seems like not related to its antimalarial property; therefore, there should be other proteins/genes expressed by 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> abled to be targeted in claiming the antimalarial agent. In the antidiabetic activity, the hypoglycemic effect of 
 <italic>Ageratum conyzoides</italic> could be due to the presence of chromene compounds. In the 
 <italic>in silico</italic> prediction, precocene I, precocene II, and VMDC show lower binding energy than other compounds in 
 <italic>Ageratum</italic>. The activity of goat weed as an MMP-9 inhibitor could be due to the sterol compounds since this class exhibits relatively good binding energies in the 
 <italic>in silico</italic> prediction. This activity could associate with its pharmacological activity as an anticancer. The correlation between 
 <italic>in silico</italic> and the classical study is highlighted in
