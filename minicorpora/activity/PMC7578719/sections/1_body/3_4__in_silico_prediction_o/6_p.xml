<p>The binding pose of all ligands is quite stable in the MMP-9 pocket site along with their binding energies. In contrast, the ligands are divided into two binding site positions when they are docked into the cyclooxygenase-2 pocket. Interestingly, two ligands, i.e., beta-sitosterol and polymethoxyflavone (5-methoxynobiletin) performed two lowest binding energies (–8.9 and –8.5 kcal/mol, respectively) when they interacted with cox-2. This means that both ligands bind to the cox-2 binding site stronger than other ligands. Although both ligands have a similar low binding energy, however, their binding positions are different which could lead to a different biological activity (see
