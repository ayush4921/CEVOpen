<p>This section will predict the interactions of seven representative compounds of 
 <italic>Ageratum conyzoides</italic> with seven proteins from respected biological activities as described before. 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table"> Table 1</xref> organizes seven compounds which could affect the corresponding protein target and also corresponds to the diseases of interest. Therefore, this prediction could inform on how 
 <italic>Ageratum conyzoides</italic> works against pathologic conditions at the molecular level. The 
 <italic>in silico</italic> method being used is molecular docking as supplemented in Supplementary Materials (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1">S1</xref>). The seven compounds (ligands) are precocene I, precocene II, VMDC, beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol, polymethoxyflavone, and pyrrolizidine, whereas the seven proteins are human tyrosinase (5m8s) [
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>], 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> ornithine delta-aminotransferase (3lg0) [
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>], 
 <italic>Mus musculus</italic> cyclooxygenase-2 (4cox) [
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>], 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> 4-diphosphodicytidyl-2-C-methylerythritol synthase (1i52) [
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>], glycoside hydrolase family 97 from 
 <italic>Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron</italic> (2zq0) [
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>], human p53 (4ibu) [
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>], and human MMP-9 (1l6j) [
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>].
