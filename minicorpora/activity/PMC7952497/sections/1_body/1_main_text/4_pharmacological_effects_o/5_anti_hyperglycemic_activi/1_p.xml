<p id="Par27">Hyperglycemia is the metabolic error in which glucose concentration increases in blood due to deficiency or insufficient production of pancreatic hormone insulin resulting in diabetes mellitus. Insulin deficiency in diabetic patient causes several abnormalities like accumulation of lipids (cholesterol and triglyceride). The methanolic extract obtained from the leaves of

Ursolic acid a pentacyclic triterpenoid act as strong hypoglycemic agent enhances vesicular insulin transportation, secretion, and induces the uptake of insulin by the glucose transporter protein (GLUT4) located on plasma membrane by activating intracellular accumulation of calcium [
