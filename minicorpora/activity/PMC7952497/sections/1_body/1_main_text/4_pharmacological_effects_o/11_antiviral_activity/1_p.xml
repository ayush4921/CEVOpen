<p id="Par33">Viral diseases are emerging as major cause of threat to human life resulting in severe death of human population worldwide. The frequent emergence of drug-resistant viral strains and acute shortage of effective vaccines and therapeutic agents for management and prevention of the viral infections invite the need of development of plant-based antiviral drugs. The plant-based natural pentacyclic triterpenoids are promising group of compounds synthesized by squalene cyclization that have notable antiviral property [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Ursolic acid expresses its cytotoxicity and virucidal effect on rotaviruses by inhibiting the replication of viral particles and adversely effecting its particle maturation by targeting main viral proteins like VP6 and NSP2, that play crucial role in viral multiplication and pathogenicity thus by targeting early replication stages of viron, ursolic acid act as potent antiviral agent [
