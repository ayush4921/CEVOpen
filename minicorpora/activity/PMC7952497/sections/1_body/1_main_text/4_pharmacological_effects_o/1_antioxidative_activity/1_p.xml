<p id="Par19">Oxidative stress is a metabolic impairment that results in an abrupt imbalance between generation and detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in human body. The ROS constitute of variable reactive species (singlet oxygen, hydrogen peroxide, nitric oxide radicals, hypochlorite radical, super oxide anion radical, lipid peroxides, hydroxyl radical, etc.), acting as free radical that reacts actively with cellular proteins, enzymes, nucleic acids, and lipids results in cellular damage and invites different categories of chronic diseases and syndromes. Human body is provided with complex antioxidant protection system (APS) to mitigate the consequences of oxidative stress by neutralizing the free radicals [
