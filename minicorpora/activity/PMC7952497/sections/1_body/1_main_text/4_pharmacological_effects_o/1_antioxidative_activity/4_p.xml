<p id="Par22">The most characteristic of plant phenolics and polyphenols is the capacity to scavenge ROS derived from lipids, proteins, oligo-nucleotides, and low-density lipoproteins (LDLs). These species are harmful for human health, cause oxidative stress-related chronic, and age-related diseases, such as cardiovascular disease (atherosclerosis), neuro-degeneration, (Alzheimerâ€™s disease), carcinogenesis, and skin deterioration [

 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>) into aggressive hydroxyl anion by Haber Weiss reaction [

In the former, the phenolic functional group transfer its hydrogen atom to free radicals while in latter the transfer of single electron results in formation of radical cation [
