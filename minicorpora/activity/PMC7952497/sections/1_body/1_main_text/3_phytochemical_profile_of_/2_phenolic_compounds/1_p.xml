<p id="Par11">Phenolics are the most abundant secondary metabolites synthesized by plants under biotic and abiotic stresses to adapt and survive it in the changing environmental conditions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The phenolics are hydroxyl derivatives of ringed aromatic compounds produced by the plants under stress conditions and they may be categorized as phenolic acids if single ring is present and polyphenolics when more than one aromatic ring is present. The hydroxyl side chain present on the aromatic ring is responsible for the specific biochemical activity of phenolic compounds produced by the plants. Majority of plant phenolics occur as glycosides produced as a result of linkage of different phenolic rings with the sugar or acetylated sugar molecules [

The plant phenolics occur in both free and bounded form, the bounded phenolics constitute beta-glycosides through stomach and small intestine, and it reaches the colon in unaltered form where they exert their chemical bioactivity. The phenolic compounds are the potent antioxidants having the ability of scavenging free oxide radicals. The number and position of hydroxyl group and nature of substitution of aromatic rings confer the magnitude of antioxidative potential to the phenolics [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Phenolics exhibits antioxidative property due to its redox potentiality, acting as reducing agent, free radical scavenger, hydrogen donors, metal chelator, quencher of lipid peroxidation, prevent DNA damage from oxidation, and scavenge reactive oxygen species, thus protecting the human body from free radicals [
