<p id="Par39">The present review tries to give broad and widespread assessment of medicinal value of underexplored, wild, and aromatic plant 
 <italic>Hyptis suaveolens</italic> and future insight on its pharmacological expansion as effective therapeutic agent against metabolic and infective human disorders. The plant has well established antioxidative, anti-cancerous, anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory, wound healing, cytotoxic, antiplasmodial, and antifungal properties due to the presence of diverse category of phytochemically active secondary metabolites having additive or synergistic pharmacological effects (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The presence of unique secondary metabolites like suaveolic acid, suaveolol, methyl suaveolate, β-sitosterol, ursolic acid, and phenolic compound like rosamarinic acid, methyl rosamarinate having potentiality to substitute the traditional drugs as therapeutic agent against the resistant and newly emerged bacterial and viral pathogens. Ursolic acid, pentacyclic triterpenoid compounds promote the apoptosis of cancerous cells by modulating diverse signaling molecules that induces cancer. It acts as protease inhibitor of main protease (M
 <sup>pro</sup>) and chymotrypsin like proteases (3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>) of SARS-CoV2 adversely affect its replication and particle assembly inside the host cells. Urosolic acid also has the ability to modify the integrase, a crucial enzyme needed for the establishment of HIV virus in human host cell. Thus secondary metabolites of 
 <italic>H</italic>. 
 <italic>suaveolens</italic> can be effectively exploited for the management of SARS-CoV2 responsible for present COVID-19 pandemic and HIV virus for which there is no effective vaccines have been developed till date. 
 <italic>H</italic>. 
 <italic>suaveolens</italic>, a widely grown weed plant, can be further explored and analyzed to develop potential, cost-effective drugs against ever mutating and resistant RNA viruses to save the humanity from deadly viral pathogens in future.
