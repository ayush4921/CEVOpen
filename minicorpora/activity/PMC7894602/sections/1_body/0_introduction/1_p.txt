0: Herpes simplex viruses (HSV) are highly contagious, double-stranded DNA viruses that cause recurrent lesions.
1: 1 They affect all age groups around the world, have no seasonal variation, and infect both humans and animals.
2: 2,  3 Appearance of lesions at the primary site of infection can occur following initial infection of abraded skin or mucosal epithelial cells.
3: 2 Subsequently, the virus can establish a lifelong, latent infection in trigeminal or lumbosacral ganglia, which can be reactivated in certain conditions.
4: 1 These conditions include physiological and psychological stress, fatigue, ultraviolet irradiation, physical trauma, abnormal hormone levels, immunosuppression, menstruation, fever, and upper respiratory tract infections.
5: 4,  5 Both primary and recurrent HSV infections may be symptomless, however, reactivation typically produces ulcerations at the primary site.
6: 6 During reactivation, but before physical symptoms arise, HSV can be virally shed, thereby having the ability to be transmitted asymptomatically.
7: 1 This makes HSV difficult to contain and efficient in spreading person-to-person.
