 </sup> Participants were not blinded to their treatment due to the unique smell of M. alternifolia oi, and 20 participants with a history of recurrent herpes labialis were recruited. Treatment was either a 6% M. alternifolia oil aqueous gel or placebo gel. Participants were instructed to apply the gel 5 times daily as close to onset of infection as possible. Those treated with M. alternifolia oil gel had a shorter duration of infection (9 days) compared to participants treated with placebo (12.5 days), and the viral load present in lesions was lower in those treated with M. alternifolia oil gel than with placebo. However, both groups had similar results for HSV presence (via PCR) and time to crust formation. Study results were not statistically significant, which the authors owe to the small population studied. However, Melaleuca alternifolia oil has potential to be a cost effective alternative topical treatment for herpes labialis infections.
