 </sup> also assessed the antiviral activity of M. officinalis on HSV infections in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The study included 66 patients based on the criteria of at least 4 episodes of herpes labialis per year. A cream was created to have 1% active ingredient, described as the dried extract of M. officinalis at a 70:1 concentration. Subjects were given either the treatment or a placebo cream and instructed to apply the cream to lesions 4 times daily for a duration of 5 days. Symptom scores were measured on the second day of treatment because most symptoms in patients with recurrent herpes labialis have the greatest severity around this time. Treatment with the M. officinalis cream resulted in significantly lower scores of symptom severity compared to placebo. The authors report that the M. officinalis cream resulted in a shortened healing time, decreased spread of virus to neighboring cells, and reduced symptoms such as itching, burning, swelling and erythema. Additionally, it is speculated that the M. officinalis cream may elongate the asymptomatic stage in individuals with recurrent herpes labialis.
