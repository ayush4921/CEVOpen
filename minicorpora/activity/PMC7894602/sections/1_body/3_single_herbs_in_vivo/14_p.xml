 </sup> against HSV-2 infection in female C57bl/6 mice. The extracts were previously found by the authors to exhibit antiviral effects against HSV-2 (strain 333) in vitro by preventing viral adsorption. When each of the extracts were administered simultaneously with the virus to mice, HSV infection was successfully prevented by all 4 extracts via viral inhibition.
