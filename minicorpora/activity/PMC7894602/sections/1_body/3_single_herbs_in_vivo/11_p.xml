 </sup> The extract was previously found by the authors to exhibit anti-HSV-1 activity in vitro, likely by blocking viral DNA synthesis. Mice were inoculated with HSV-1 (strain KOS) and treated orally with either 20 or 50 mg/kg of the extract or 60 mg/kg of acyclovir 3 times a day for 7 days. No differences were observed in the development of lesions in mice treated with 20 mg/kg of extract and control. However, lesions completely disappeared in mice treated with 50 mg/kg of the extract or acyclovir, suggesting both are effective at preventing lesion formation. Further experiments revealed L. chinensis disrupts HSV-1 replication in mice, likely by reducing viral DNA expression. The extract was found not to have any toxic effects on the liver or kidneys of mice treated with the extract.
