 </sup> investigated the antiviral effects of 4 extracts of Melissa officinalis on HSV-1 (strain DA) infection in rabbits. Extracts were prepared with either 50% ethyl alcohol, 50% ethanol extract, ethyl acetate, or water. Rabbits were infected with HSV-1 into their eyes and treated 1 of the 4 extracts, 8 or 9 times a day at 1-hour intervals. Tear secretions were taken from each rabbit daily for 7 days and analyzed. No differences were found between treated and control rabbits for any outcome measure. The authors were unable to demonstrate antiviral effects of M. officinalis extracts in vivo.
