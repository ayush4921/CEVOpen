 </sup> studied the anti-HSV-1 activity of oral and topical administrations of a hydroethanolic extract of Tanacetum parthenium in BALB/c mice. The extract was previously found by the authors to exhibit antiviral effects against HSV-1 (strain KOS) in vitro. Oral administration was given once daily and mice were administered either no treatment, control treatment, acyclovir at 10 mg/kg body weight, hydroethanolic extract at 4 mg/kg body weight, or hydroethanolic extract at 8 mg/kg body weight. Topical administration was given 4 times a day and mice were administered either no treatment, control treatment, 5% acyclovir, 2.5% hydroethanolic extract, or 5% hydroethanolic extract. Both arms were carried out for 10 days. The hydroethanolic extract was determined not to be genotoxic nor irritating. Oral and topical treatment with the extract or acyclovir was found to yield similar results, but improvement of HSV lesions was mild compared to inactive treatments.
