 </sup> in 3 studies for their ability to delay development of lesions and prolong survival time of female BALB/c mice infected with HSV-1 (strain 7401 H). Many of these extracts were previously found by the authors to exhibit antiviral effects against HSV-1 in vitro, either alone or in combination with acyclovir. In the first study, Kurokawa et al.

 </sup> cutaneously inoculated mice with HSV-1 and aqueous plant extracts were orally administered at a dose of 1-10 mg in a volume of 0.25 ml/mouse once at 8 hours prior to inoculation and then 3 times daily for 10 days after inoculation. The extracts of Alpinia officinarum, Caesalpinia sappan, Geum japonicum, Paeonia suffruticosa, Phellodendron amurense, Polygala tenufolia, Punica granatum, Rhus javanica, Syzygium aromaticum, Terminalia arjuna, and Terminalia chebula significantly delayed the development and progression of herpes lesions. The only extract to prolong mean survival time was Phellodendron amurense.
