 </sup> investigated the anti-HSV activity of a crude hydroethanolic extract of Schinus terebinthifolia in female BALB/c mice. The extract was previously found by the authors to exhibit antiviral effects against HSV-1 in vitro by inhibiting viral attachment and penetration. Mice were infected with HSV-1 (strain KOS) and either given no treatment, 2% crude extract, 5% crude extract, or acyclovir cream 5 times per day for 10 days. The lesions developed more slowly and cleared up more quickly on mice who were treated with the crude extract versus no treatment. Additionally, the authors report no statistically significant differences between the lesions in mice treated with crude extract versus acyclovir. It is important to acknowledge that the authors also verified an absence of genotoxicity from the crude extract on bone marrow of the rodents.
