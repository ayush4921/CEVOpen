 </sup> tested the antiviral activities of 4 aqueous extracts of G. japonicum, R. javanica, S. aromaticum, and T. chebula each in combination with acyclovir. Extracts were dosed at 250 mg/kg and acyclovir at 2.5 mg/kg. The combination of acyclovir with G. japonicum, S. aromaticum, and T. chebula showed to significantly delay the development and progression of herpes lesions and/or mean survival time compared to acyclovir or extract alone. The combination of acyclovir with R. javanica did not show significant antiviral effects compared to acyclovir or extract alone. No significant toxicity was found for any of the combinations tested. Additionally, the 4 extracts and acyclovir were tested on viral yields in the skin and brain of mice. The extracts showed 2.5-20 times greater antiviral activity in the brain than skin. On the other hand, acyclovir was observed to elicit stronger anti-HSV effects in the skin than the brain. The combination of acyclovir with each of the extracts exhibited stronger antiviral effects than acyclovir or extract alone, and these effects were stronger in the brain than skin.
