 </sup> found that a hydroethanolic extract of M. officinalis elicited significant antiviral effects on HSV-2 after viral penetration. The extract was first tested for cytotoxicity and showed no impairment to cells up to a concentration of 1 mg/ml. When Vero cells were treated with the extract at a dose of 0.5 mg/ml post-infection, the cytopathic effect was reduced by 60%, which was the maximum effect observed. However, incubation of the extract with HSV-2 virions did not reduce viral penetration. The authors suggest that M. officinalis does not bind to HSV-2 to prevent entry into host cells, but elicits its effects after penetration.
