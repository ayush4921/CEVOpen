 </sup> observed an aqueous extract made from the aerial parts of Rhododendron ferrugineum to prevent HSV-1 (strain 17 syn
 <sup>+</sup>) attachment and penetration into host cells. The extract completely interfered with viral attachment and penetration at concentrations greater than 1 μg/ml and 25 μg/ml, respectively. When virions were pretreated with the extract, antiviral effects corresponded to an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 7.4 μg/ml and SI of 63.9. The authors suggest that R. ferrugineum directly interacts with the viral envelope to prevent attachment and penetration into host cells.
