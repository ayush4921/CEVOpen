 </sup> studied the mycelia of the mushroom Lentinus edodes for antiviral activity against HSV-1 (strain F). L. edodes was cultured, extracted, and filtered with the end product being named JLS-S001. This extract was observed to block the release of HSV-1 particles from cells (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 20 Âµg/ml, SI = 40). When cells were pretreated with the extract, viral adsorption was not observed to be prevented.
