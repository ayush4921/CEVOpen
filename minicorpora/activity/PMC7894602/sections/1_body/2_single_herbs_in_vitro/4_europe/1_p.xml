 </sup> explored prophylactic and therapeutic effects of 4 extracts of M. officinalis on HSV-1 (strain DA) using the solvents 50% ethyl alcohol, 50% ethanol, ethyl acetate, and water. When incubated with HSV-1 virions, complete viral inactivation was noted by 3 hours with the water extract and by 12 hours with the non-aqueous extracts. Furthermore, the non-aqueous extracts were added to rabbit kidney (RK) cells pre- and post-infection, but all 3 extracts failed to inhibit viral reproduction.
