 </sup> by investigating an aqueous extract of M. officinalis for antiviral activity against HSV-1 (strain KOS). Pretreatment of virions with the extract demonstrated an IC
 <sub>50</sub> and SI of 0.4 μg/ml and 875, respectively, and &gt;99% of viral inactivation was seen at a concentration of 15 μg/ml. Furthermore, the extract inhibited viral attachment to RC-37 cells by 98% at 7.5 μg/ml, a concentration 20 times lower than its maximum non-cytotoxic concentration (150 μg/ml). The authors conclude that since M. officinalis demonstrated both viral inactivation and inhibition of viral attachment, the plant is a good candidate for use as a prophylactic for HSV infections.
