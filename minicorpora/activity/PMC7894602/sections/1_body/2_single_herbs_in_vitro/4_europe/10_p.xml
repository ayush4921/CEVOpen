<p>Many other European plants that do not belong to the Lamiaceae family have been studied for their antiviral effects. Extracts of Geranium sanguineum were tested by Serkedjieva and Ivancheva

 </sup> for their antiviral abilities against HSV-1 (strain KOS) and HSV-2 (strain G) in Vero and human embryonic skin-muscle (E6SM) cells. Five extracts were made with aerial root parts from the early plant and ethanol, methanol, or hydroethanol; overground parts and methanol; and aerial root parts from the late plant and methanol. The strongest antiviral effect was observed by the hydroethanolic extract (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 5.4 μg/ml and SI = 17.8) and the weakest by the methanolic overground extract (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 12.1 μg/ml and SI = 5.6). The hydroethanolic extract demonstrated a dose-dependent viral inhibition against HSV-1 and was further tested for virucidal action against HSV-2. HSV-2 showed to be more susceptible to the extract (SI = 27.7) compared to HSV-1. Also, time-of-addition experiments revealed that the hydroethanolic extract only elicits significant antiviral effects when added to cells post-infection, but not when added to cells pre-infection or during viral adsorption or penetration.
