 </sup> aqueous extracts of Agrimonia pilosa, Pithecellobium clypearia, and Punica granatum showed antiviral activity against different strains of HSV-1 (strain 15577). These 3 extracts showed IC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranging 62.5-125 μg/ml and SI values ranging 4-12 against the standard strain. Additionally, the extracts’ IC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranged 62.5-125 μg/ml and 50-125 μg/ml against the acyclovir-resistant and clinical strain, respectively. While each plant extract was effective against all HSV-1 strains, A. pilosa was most effective against the acyclovir-resistant strain (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 100 μg/ml and SI = 5), P. clypearia against the standard strain (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 62.5 μg/ml and SI = 4), and P. granatum against the clinical strain (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 50 μg/ml and SI = 20).
