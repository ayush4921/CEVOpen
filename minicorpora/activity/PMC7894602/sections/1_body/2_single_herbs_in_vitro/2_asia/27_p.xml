 </sup> for its effect against HSV-2 infection by administering a crude hot glycerine extract to infected Vero cells at different times during infection. The extract was found to elicit complete cytopathic effects on HSV-2 at a concentration of 700 μg/ml when added at viral inoculation, and the IC
 <sub>50</sub> and SI values were determined to be 428 μg/ml and 7.56, respectively. When the extract was added after the viral attachment stage, a dose of 850 μg/ml entirely prevented the cytopathic effect of HSV-2. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> and SI values were determined to be 536 μg/ml and 6.04, respectively.
