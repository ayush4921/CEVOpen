 </sup> At a concentration of 100 μg/ml, the following extracts inhibited 100% of plaque formation and their IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were subsequently determined: the methanolic extracts of Eurycoma longifolia (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 62 μg/ml), Filicium decipiens (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 68 μg/ml), Garcinia mangostana (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 40 μg/ml), and Toona sureni (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 37 μg/ml); and the aqueous and methanolic extracts of Nephelium lappaceum (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 62 μg/ml and 70 μg/ml, respectively) and Punica granatum (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 68 μg/ml and 64 μg/ml, respectively). All extracts showed no cytotoxicity at 100 μg/ml except for T. sureni.
