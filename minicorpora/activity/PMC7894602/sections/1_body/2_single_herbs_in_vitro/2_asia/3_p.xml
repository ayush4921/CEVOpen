 </sup> also tested the antiviral effects of H. cordata, but against HSV-2 (strain G ATCC-VR-734). An aqueous extract of the leaves and stems significantly prevented Vero cell death that is associated with HSV-2 infection, and an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 50 μg/ml was determined. In addition, the extract significantly inhibited virus production by more than 3 and 4 logs at doses of 150 μg/ml and 450 μg/ml, respectively. The extract demonstrated inhibition of NF-| B, which is activated during HSV-2 infection and required for viral replication. Time-of-addition experiments revealed the extract was able to elicit similar antiviral effects when added to cells before, during, or just after HSV-2 infection, suggesting H. cordata acts early in viral infection.
