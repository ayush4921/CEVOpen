<p>Moreover, a methanolic extract of Achyranthes aspera was investigated for antiviral effects against HSV-1 (strain F) and HSV-2 (strain G) by Mukherjee et al.

 </sup> The extract inhibited HSV plaque formation in a dose-dependent manner with 100% inhibition of HSV-1 and HSV-2 noted at 112.5 μg/ml and 120 μg/ml, respectively. The EC
 <sub>50</sub> and SI values, respectively, of the extract were determined to be 64.4 μg/ml and 10.2 for HSV-1 and 72.8 μg/ml and 9.0 for HSV-2. For comparison, acyclovir was found to have EC
 <sub>50</sub> and SI values, respectively, of 2.1 μg/ml and 61.9 for HSV-1 and 2.9 μg/ml and 44.8 for HSV-2. Time-of-addition experiments revealed that A. aspera elicits its antiviral effects post-infection for both viruses with little inhibition noted before or at the time of infection.
