 </sup> investigated the antiviral effect of an ethanolic extract of the bark of Phellodendron amurense, a herb that is considered as one of the 50 fundamental herbs in China. The extract’s maximum non-cytotoxic dose was determined as 44.12 μg/ml and was tested at different stages during HSV-1 infection. Pretreatment of cells with the extract only inhibited about 10% of HSV-1 plaques, but pretreatment of HSV-1 resulted in 74% inhibition of plaque formation. Addition of the extract during the viral adsorption and replication inhibited plaques by 10-15%. Acyclovir was also tested and found to inhibit over 90% of plaques only when added during viral replication. These results suggest that P. amurense elicits effects prior to viral infection and acyclovir elicits effects after infection.
