 </sup> Water extracts using dried powder of the leaves and stems of the plant were prepared to a total concentration of 1 g/ml. Subsequent dilutions and treatment to cells showed that the extract inhibited plaque formation by more than 70% at a dilution of 1:64. Adding the extract at 4, 8, and 24 hours after infection showed the greatest reduction in infected cells at 4 hours. Additionally, no genetic material amplification was found at 12, 24, 48, or 72 hours after simultaneous HSV-1 infection and S. chirata treatment.
