 </sup> tested ethanolic extracts of 7 Chinese herbs against HSV-1 (strain KOS) and found only Psychotria serpens, at a dose of 100 μg/ml, to significantly reduce plaque number to almost zero. This effect was similar to that of 10 μM of acyclovir. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of the extract of P. serpens was determined to be 58.3 mg/ml. The other herbs, which showed little effect on the virus, were Ampelopsis cantoniensis, Melilotus indicus, Verbena bonariensis, Buddleia asiatica, Ruta graveolens, and Tadehagi triquetrum.
