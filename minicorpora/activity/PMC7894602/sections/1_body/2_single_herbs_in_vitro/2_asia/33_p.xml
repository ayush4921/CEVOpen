 </sup> found both viruses to be more susceptible to the ethanolic extract (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.022 μg/ml and SI = 618.2 for HSV-1; IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.10 μg/ml and SI = 136.0 for HSV-2) compared to the aqueous extract (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 14.93 μg/ml and SI &gt;15 for HSV-1; IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.33 μg/ml and SI &gt;100 for HSV-2). The ethanolic extract showed greater antiviral activity than acyclovir (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.59 μg/ml and SI &gt;55.9 for HSV-1; IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.62 μg/ml and SI &gt;53.2 for HSV-2). Time-response assays showed 90% plaque inhibition after a treatment duration of 10 minutes with the ethanolic extract and 60 minutes with the aqueous extract. Additionally, the extracts were added at different times during viral infection. Both extracts significantly reduced plaque formation by 95-99% only when either HSV-1 or HSV-2 was pretreated with the extract. When the extracts were added during HSV-2 adsorption, plaque formation was inhibited by about 45-60%. Acyclovir was antiviral when added post-infection, during viral intracellular replication. These results suggest that C. cajan elicits its antiviral effects directly on HSV virions.
