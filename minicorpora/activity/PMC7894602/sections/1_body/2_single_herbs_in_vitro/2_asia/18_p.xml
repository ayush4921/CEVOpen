 </sup> also explored the anti-HSV-1 activity of Azardirachta indica, specifically focusing on the mechanism of action. Aqueous extracts of the plant’s bark at concentrations ranging 50-100 μg/ml were observed to block entry of HSV-1 (strain KOS) into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1), HeLa, Vero, and retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. Experiments using different HSV-1 strains (F, G, MP, and 17) revealed A. incida was not strain-specific as its inhibitory effects were similar toward each strain. The extract blocked the attachment of HSV-1 virions to cells, and when cells were pretreated with the extract, viral glycoprotein mediated cell-cell fusion was inhibited. To note, A. incida was only shown to inhibit viral entry when HSV-1 was pretreated with the extract and not when cells were pretreated, suggesting activity is to due effects on viral particles.
