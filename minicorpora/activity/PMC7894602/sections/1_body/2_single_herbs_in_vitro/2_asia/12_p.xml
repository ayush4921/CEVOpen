 </sup> crude water extracts of 8 Thai medicinal plants were evaluated against HSV-1 (KOS strain) and HSV-2 (Baylor 186 strain). Extracts of Centella asiatica, Mangifera indica, and Madura cochinchinensis showed antiviral activity against both viruses. EC
 <sub>50</sub> and SI values, respectively, against HSV-1 were 362.40 μg/ml and 3.9 for C. asiatica, 23.94 μg/ml and 29.5 for M. indica, and 20.19 μg/ml and 8.8 for M. cochinchinensis. EC
 <sub>50</sub> and SI values, respectively, against HSV-2 were 298.84 μg/ml and 4.7 for C. asiatica, 31.83 μg/ml and 22.2 for M. indica, and 68.32 μg/ml and 2.6 for M. cochinchinensis. This was compared to the efficacy of acyclovir that showed EC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.14 μg/ml and 0.15 μg/ml for HSV-1 and HSV-2, respectively. Combinations of the extracts and acyclovir were also studied. The combination of C. asiatica and M. indica was shown to exert an additive effect on HSV-2, and each extract with acyclovir resulted in complementary or boosted antiviral effects if the dose of acyclovir was high enough. These results suggest that C. asiatica, M. indica, and M. cochinchinensis may be of use alone or combined for treatment of HSV infections.
