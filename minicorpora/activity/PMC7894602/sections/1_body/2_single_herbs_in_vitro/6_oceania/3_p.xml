 </sup> investigated antiviral effects of the essential oil of Leptospermum scoparium, commonly known as Manuka oil, against both HSV-1 (strain KOS) and HSV-2 (strain HG52). Manuka oil, which is commercially used as an anti-infective oil in New Zealand, was diluted with ethanol to a final ethanol concentration of 1% for all assays. L. scoparium essential oil inhibited plaque formation for both viruses in a dose-dependent manner when virions were pretreated with the oil. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> and SI values, respectively, were determined to be 0.96 μg/ml and 40 for HSV-1 and 0.58 μg/ml and 66.2 for HSV-2. Furthermore, manuka oil was added at the non-cytotoxic concentration of 28.8 μg/ml to HSV-treated cells at different stages of the viral infection cycle. Pretreatment of cells with the oil prior to viral infection did not reduce plaque formation. However, pretreatment of viruses prior to infection reduced infectivity by 99.5% and 98.9% for HSV-1 and HSV-2, respectively. Manuka oil was less effective as the viral life cycle progressed. Therefore, L. scoparium essential oil has the potential to be effective as a prophylactic for HSV infection rather than a treatment.
