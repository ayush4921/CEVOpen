 </sup> compared the antiherpetic effect of tea tree oil, from Melaleuca alternifolia, to that of eucalyptus oil, from Eucalyptus globulus. Tea tree oil (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.0009% and SI = 6.7 for HSV-1; IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.0008% and SI = 7.5 for HSV-2) demonstrated more potent antiviral activity than eucalyptus oil (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.009% and SI = 3.3 for HSV-1; IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.008% and SI = 3.75 for HSV-2). Additionally, tea tree oil had significantly greater virucidal activity when virions were pretreated, eliminating over 90% of each HSV strain at non-cytotoxic concentrations. Eucalyptus oil showed 58% and 75% reduction in viral titers of HSV-1 and HSV-2, respectively. Time-of-addition experiments revealed that both oils have the ability to impact viral adsorption, but not after viral penetration. The authors conclude that oils from either M. alternifolia or E. globulus have potential to be effective topical treatments for HSV infections.
