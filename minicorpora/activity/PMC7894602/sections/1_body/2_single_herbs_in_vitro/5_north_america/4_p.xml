 </sup> tested Cornus canadensis for its antiviral actions against HSV-1 (strain ATCC-VR733). The extracts were made from dried stems and leaves via decoction or infusion with 3 different solvents each: water, ethanol, and 1:1 of water and ethanol. Viral absorption was best prevented by the simultaneous addition of HSV-1 and the water: ethanol infusion as well as the water decoction, both demonstrating an EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 9 μg/ml. Direct viral inhibition was seen with both the decoctions and infusions of either the water or water: ethanol extracts, EC
 <sub>50</sub> ranging 11-17 μg/ml. No extracts were observed to elicit antiviral effects when cells were pretreated nor when added during viral replication, defined by the authors as having EC
 <sub>50</sub> values &gt;50 μg/ml. Therefore, C. canadensis is most effective when used during or after the initial stages of the viral infection.
