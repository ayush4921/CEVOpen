 </sup> assessed a hydromethanolic extract of Graptopetalum paraguayense for antiviral activity against strains of HSV-1 and HSV-2. The extract was found to be antiviral toward wild-type strains of HSV-1 (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.0001 mg/ml, SI = 25,000) and HSV-2 (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.01 mg/ml, SI = 250), and acyclovir-resistant strains of HSV-1 (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.001 mg/ml, SI = 2,500) and HSV-2 (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.1 mg/ml, SI = 25). Interestingly, the extract had greater antiherpetic action than acyclovir in all 4 strains tested.
