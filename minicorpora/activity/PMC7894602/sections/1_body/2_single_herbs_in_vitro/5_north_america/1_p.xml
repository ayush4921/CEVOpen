 </sup> studied the antiviral effects of O. streptacantha against HSV-2 (strain 3345), using extracts of dried powder, acetone, ether, and chloroform. Different concentrations of the extract were added to baby hamster kidney cells (BHK-21) immediately after viral adsorption. A concentration of 3.5 mg/ml reduced viral replication by 2.3 log
 <sub>10</sub>, and at 15 mg/ml, viral replication ceased entirely. Also, at a concentration of 15 mg/ml, viral protein synthesis was completely inhibited, but no effects on cellular protein synthesis were observed. More potent effects on viral replication were seen with pretreatment of cells 24 hours prior to viral inoculation, which inhibited replication by 2.6 log
 <sub>10</sub> at a concentration of 3.5 mg/ml. Similar reductions were noted with pretreatment of cells 48 hours pre-infection. Additionally, human cervical cells were inoculated with HSV-2 then incubated with the plant extract or placebo for 2 days. When the extract was delivered at a concentration of 15 mg/ml, the viral replication was reduced by 3.5 log
 <sub>10</sub>. Lastly, humans were given either 3 or 6 grams of O. streptacantha for 30 days to assess toxicity. No adverse events were reported from human ingestion of the extract after 30 days.
