 </sup> assessed the antiviral activity of an aqueous extract of the leaves and stems of Phyllanthus orbicularis, a plant native to Cuba, against HSV-2 in human foreskin fibroblast cells. The extract demonstrated EC
 <sub>50</sub> and SI values of 25.7 μg/ml and 26.03, respectively. Direct treatment of HSV-2 virions resulted in a 2 log10 reduction in viral titers with treatment of 5-25 μg/ml of P. orbicularis extract and a 2.75 log10 reduction with 50-75 μg/ml of the extract. The authors suggest that P. orbicularis may elicit its antiherpetic effects by inhibiting virions, either directly or by blocking their entry into host cells.
