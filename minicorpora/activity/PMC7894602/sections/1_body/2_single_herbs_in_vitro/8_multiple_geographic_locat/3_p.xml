 </sup> The mushrooms were cultured as biomass and the mycelia were made into aqueous extracts using a 0.9% sodium chloride solution. Four species were found to inhibit HSV-2 replication, namely Fomes fomentarius (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.62 mg/ml and SI = 40.32), Pleurotus ostreatus (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.155 mg/ml and SI = 80.64), Auriporia aurea (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.155 mg/ml and SI = 161.29), and Trametes versicolor (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.077 mg/ml and SI = 324.67).
