 </sup> for antiviral activity against HSV-2. Only the seed extract demonstrated viral inhibition (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 161 μg/ml and SI = 13.19). Time-of-addition experiments showed that the seed extract offered direct virucidal activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 49 μg/ml and SI = 43.46) and interfered with viral adsorption and lysis, but it did not protect pretreated cells from viral infection.
