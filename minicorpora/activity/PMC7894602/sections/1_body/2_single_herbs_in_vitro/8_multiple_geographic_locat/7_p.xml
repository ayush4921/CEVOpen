 </sup> with ethanol and assessed against HSV-1 (strain F and 5 isolates) and HSV-2 (strain G and 5 isolates). The extract had similar antiviral activity against HSV-1 strain F (ED
 <sub>50</sub> = 72.8 μg/ml and SI = 1.55) and HSV-2 strain G (ED
 <sub>50</sub> = 74.4 μg/ml and SI = 1.52). HSV-1 isolates and HSV-2 isolates that also showed activity had similar antiviral effects (ED
 <sub>50</sub> = 62.0-73.1 μg/ml and SI = 1.54-1.82; ED
 <sub>50</sub> = 42.6-52.9 μg/ml and SI = 2.13-2.65, respectively). Both HSV-1 strain F and HSV-2 strain G were completely inactivated after exposure to the extract for 3 hours at a concentration of 78.1 μg/ml. Additionally, when administered 30 hours after infection, the extract was able to inhibit 10-27% of replication of HSV-1 and HSV-1 isolates and 16-35% of replication of HSV-2 and HSV-2 isolates.
