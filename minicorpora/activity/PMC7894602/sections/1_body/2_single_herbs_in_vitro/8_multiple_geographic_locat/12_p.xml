 </sup> found an ethanolic extract of Rubus eubatus berries to elicit direct virucidal effects and prevent viral adsorption and replication of HSV-1 (strain 17
 <sup>+</sup>) in oral epithelial (OKF6) cells. Specifically, 56 μg/ml of extract was able to reduce viral yield by 99%. When the extract was added 1 hour post-infection, a concentration of 280 μg/ml was required to significantly reduce viral yields. Additionally, the extract was not found to be cytotoxic at high concentrations.
