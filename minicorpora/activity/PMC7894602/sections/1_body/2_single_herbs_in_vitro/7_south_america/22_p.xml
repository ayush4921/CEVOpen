 </sup> assessed aqueous and hydroalcoholic (50% and 70%) extracts from 6 Brazilian plants against HSV-1. The plants studied were Campomanesia eugenioides, Luehea paniculata, Ocimum gratissimum, Cordia americana, Schinus terebinthifolius, and Zanthoxylum rhoifolium. All extracts, except the aqueous extracts of C. americana and Z. rhoifolium bark, showed anti-HSV-1 activity. The hydroalcoholic extracts (EC
 <sub>50</sub> and SI ranged 1.4-26 μg/ml and 6.9-21.3, respectively) were observed to have greater antiviral effects compared to the aqueous extracts (EC
 <sub>50</sub> and SI ranged 0.6-20 μg/ml and 13-62, respectively). The highest SI values observed were from the 70% hydroalcoholic extracts of C. eugenioides (52) and C. americana bark (55) and the 50% hydroalcoholic extracts of O. gratissimum,
