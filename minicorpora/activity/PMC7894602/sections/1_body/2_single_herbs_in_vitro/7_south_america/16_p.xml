 </sup> Extracts were prepared with water, ethanol, 40% hydroethanol, or methanol. Antiherpetic activity, defined by the authors as a SI &gt;7, was exhibited toward HSV-1 strain KOS by the aqueous extract of Ilex paraguariensis (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 80.0 μg/ml and SI = 15.8) and the methanolic extracts of Rubus imperialis (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 70.0 μg/ml and SI = 19.8) and Lafoensia pacari (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 60.0 μg/ml and SI = 19.0). Additionally, antiherpetic activity against strain 29-R/acyclovir-resistant was observed by the aqueous extracts of I. paraguariensis (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 100.0 μg/ml and SI = 12.6) and Passiflora edulis (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 89.9 μg/ml and SI = 17.8) and the methanolic extracts of R. imperialis (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 90.0 μg/ml and SI = 15.4) and Sloanea guianensis (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 140.0 μg/ml and SI = 10.0).
