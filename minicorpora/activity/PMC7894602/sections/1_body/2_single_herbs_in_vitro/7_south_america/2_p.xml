 </sup> assessed aqueous and hydroalcoholic extracts of 36 species of Chilean plants for antiviral activity against HSV-1 (strain F) and HSV-2 (strain 333). Hydroalcoholic extracts of Cassia stipulaceae (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 80 µg/ml) and Illinita sp. (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 40 µg/ml) were found to have antiviral activity against HSV-1. Antiviral activity against HSV-2 was observed from the hydroalcoholic extracts of Aristotelia chilensis (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 40 µg/ml), Drimys winteri (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 35-80 µg/ml), and Elytropus chilensis (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 100 µg/ml) and the aqueous extract of Luma apiculata (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 100 µg/ml).
