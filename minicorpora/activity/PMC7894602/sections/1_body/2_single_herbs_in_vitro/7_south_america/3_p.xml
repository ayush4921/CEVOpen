 </sup> The plants tested were Polygonum punctatum, Lithraea molleoides, Sebastiania brasiliensis, Myrcianthes cisplatensis, and Sebastiania klotzschiana. All extracts were found to have an antiviral effect except for M. cisplatensis. The greatest viral inhibition was observed by S. klotzschiana with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 39 μg/ml. Other observed EC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranged 51-169 μg/ml. The maximal non-cytotoxic concentrations were found to be 450 μg/ml for P. punctatum and 250 μg/ml for L. molleoides, S. brasiliensis, and S. klotzschiana.
