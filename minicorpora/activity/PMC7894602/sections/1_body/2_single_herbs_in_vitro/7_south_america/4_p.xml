<p>Ethanolic and aqueous extracts of Baccharis genistelloides, Baccharis rubricaulis, Ambrosia arborescens, Phoradendron crassifolium, Rumex obtusifolius, Plantago australis, and Satureja boliviana, plants native to Bolivia, were tested by Abad et al.

 </sup> for antiviral effects against HSV-1. Ethanolic extracts demonstrated high cytotoxicity, for example, the ethanolic extract of B. rubricaulis was cytotoxic at concentrations as low as 5 μg/ml. Only aqueous extracts were observed for antiviral effects, however, their maximum non-cytotoxic concentrations were at the upper limit of their effective concentration ranges The aqueous extracts that demonstrated inhibition of HSV-1 were S. boliviana, B. genistelloides, and P. crassifolium. Concentrations that were observed to show antiherpetic effects were 10-125 μg/ml, 25-50 μg/ml, and 125-500 μg/ml for S. boliviana, B. genistelloides, and P. crassifolium, respectively.
