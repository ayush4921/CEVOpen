 </sup> A total of 30 extracts were found to be non-cytotoxic at reasonable or ideal doses, and 10 of these were found to exhibit some antiherpetic activity. Extracts that showed moderate effects were Arrabidaea formosa (leaves: EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 82.2 μg/ml and SI &gt;6.1; stems: EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 90.2 μg/ml and SI &gt;5.5) and Zeyheria tuberculosa (leaves: EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 81.8 μg/ml and SI = 2.1). Low activity was observed by Anemopaegma setilobum (leaves: EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 138.1 μg/ml and SI &gt;1.4; stems: EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 168.2 μg/ml and SI &gt;3.0), Arrabidaea craterophora (stems: EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 188.1 μg/ml and SI = 1.9), A. formosa (fruit: EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 148.5 μg/ml and SI &gt;3.4), Arrabidaea pulchra (leaves: EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 232.1 μg/ml and SI &gt;2.2), Arrabidaea sceptrum (stems: EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 375.3 μg/ml and SI &gt;1.3), and Stizophyllum perforatum (stems: EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 338.7 μg/ml and SI &gt;1.5).
