 </sup> and further fractionated with different proportions of chloroform-methanol ranging from 100:0-90:10. The extracts exhibited virucidal activity against HSV-1 (strain F) in a dose-dependent manner. At a dose of 0.25 mg/ml, the 95:5 and 90:10 chloroform-methanolic fractions reduced viral titers by 2.4 log
 <sub>10</sub> and 1.5 log
 <sub>10</sub>, respectively. Additionally, 33% reduction of HSV titers was observed with 0.27 mg/ml of the 95:5 chloroform-methanolic fraction, 0.35 mg/ml of the 90:10 chloroform-methanolic fraction, and 0.5 mg/ml of the methanolic extract.
