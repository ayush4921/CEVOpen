 </sup> Extracts were tested against HSV-1 strain KOS, and those that exhibited anti-HSV activity were subsequently tested against the HSV-1 strains ATCC-VR733 and 29-R/acyclovir-resistant. The aqueous extracts of Ilex brevicuspis (5 mg/ml), Ilex theezans (0.25 mg/ml), and Maytenus ilicifolia (1.25 mg/ml) and the hydroethanolic extracts of Aloysia gratissima (1.25 mg/ml), Baccharis megapotamica (0.0048 mg/ml), and M. ilicifolia (0.5 mg/ml) inhibited 100% of viral cytopathic effects at their determined maximum tolerated concentrations. The hydroethanolic extracts of Baccharis erioclada (0.25 mg/ml), Glechon marifolia (0.625 mg/ml), and Glechon spathulata (0.25 mg/ml) inhibited 100% of viral cytopathic effects at half of their maximum tolerated concentrations. The aqueous extract of B. erioclada (0.312 mg/ml) and the hydroethanolic extract of Baccharis uncinella (0.312 mg/ml) inhibited 100% of viral cytopathic effects at a quarter of their maximum tolerated concentrations. Additionally, complete inhibition of cytopathic effects from HSV-1 strain ATCC-VR733 was observed from the aqueous extracts of I. brevicuspis (5 mg/ml), I. theezans (0.25 mg/ml), B. erioclada (0.625 mg/ml), and M. ilicifolia (1.25 mg/ml) and the hydroethanolic extracts of B. erioclada (0.5 mg/ml), M. ilicifolia (0.5 mg/ml), G. marifolia (0.625 mg/ml), G. spathulata (0.25 mg/ml), and A. gratissima (1.25 mg/ml). Lastly, the extracts that showed complete inhibition cytopathic effects of the 29-R/acyclovir-resistant HSV-1 strain were the aqueous extract B. erioclada (1.25 mg/ml) and the hydroethanolic extracts of B. erioclada (0.5 mg/ml), B. uncinella (1.25 mg/ml), and G. spathulata (0.25 mg/ml).
