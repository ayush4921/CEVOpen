 </sup> Extracts were prepared using either dichloromethane and methanol in a 1:1 ratio or dichloromethane alone and added to Vero cells at determined maximum non-cytotoxic concentrations at the same time as viral infection. Strong antiviral activity against acyclovir-resistant HSV-1, defined as greater than 90% percent inhibition of viral titers, was exhibited by the dichloromethanic and methanolic extracts of Laurencia dendroidea (97.5% inhibition at 3.1 µg/ml), Hypnea spinella (92% inhibition at 200 µg/ml), Lobophora variegata (92% inhibition at 6.2 µg/ml), Stypopodium zonale (96.8% inhibition at 50 µg/ml), Sargassum cymosum (98.2% inhibition at 50 µg/ml), Ulva fasciata (99.9% inhibition at 200 µg/ml), and Codium decorticatum (99.9% inhibition at 200 µg/ml) as well as the dichloromethanic extract of Penicillus capitatus (93.0% inhibition at 250 µg/ml). Moreover, strong antiviral activity against acyclovir-resistant HSV-2 was exhibited by the dichloromethanic and methanolic extracts of Chondracanthus acicularis (92.4% inhibition at 100 µg/ml) and Stypopodium zonale (95.8% inhibition at 50 µg/ml) as well as the dichloromethanic extract of Penicillus capitatus (96% inhibition at 250 µg/ml). Cytotoxicity was not noted by the extracts that exhibited strong anti-HSV activity (CC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 200 µg/ml), except the extract of L. dendroidea (CC
 <sub>50</sub> = 48.2 µg/ml).
