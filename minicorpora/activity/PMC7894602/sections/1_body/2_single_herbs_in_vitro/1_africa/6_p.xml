 </sup> investigated the anti-HSV activity of Carissa edulis, a medicinal plant that grows locally in Kenya and used traditionally for a variety of ailments such as skin conditions and sexually transmitted infections. An aqueous extract was prepared from C. edulis roots, freeze-dried, and tested against wild-type HSV-1 (strain 7401 H) and HSV-2 (strain Ito-1262), thymidine kinase-deficient HSV-1 (strain B2006), and acyclovir-resistant 7401 H HSV-1. The extract inhibited plaque formation of all 4 strains, but wild-type HSV-2 (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 6.9 μg/ml and SI = 69.6) and thymidine kinase-deficient HSV-1 strain (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 8.1 μg/ml and SI = 59.3) were more susceptible to the extract. Moreover, at 200 μg/ml, the extract reduced viral yields of acyclovir-resistant HSV-1 strain by 100%, wild-type HSV-2 strain by 99.5%, wild-type HSV-1 strain by 97.8%, and thymidine kinase-deficient HSV-1 strain by 96.3%. These results are significant considering acyclovir at 5 μg/ml was tested against thymidine kinase-deficient HSV-1 strain and acyclovir-resistant HSV-1 strain and showed a viral yield reduction of only 3.0% and 1.5%, respectively.
