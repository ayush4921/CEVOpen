<p>The antiviral activity of 4 methanolic extracts of Combretum micranthum was tested against HSV-1 (strain F) and HSV-2 (strain G) by Ferrea et al.

 </sup> Dried leaves were used to prepare the extracts using 4 different solvents: regular methanol, aqueous methanol, aqueous methanol with addition of HCl and NaOH, and NaOH autoxidized methanol. Only the NaOH autoxidized methanolic extract showed anti-HSV activity. The authors believe this is due to inactive precursors in the plant being transformed to active compounds by alkaline catalysis. The extract was more effective when cells were treated at the same time of viral infection (EC
 <sub>50</sub> was 8 μg/ml and 19 μg/ml for HSV-1 and HSV-2, respectively) compared to treatment after 1 hour of viral adsorption (EC
 <sub>50</sub> was 150 μg/ml and 227 μg/ml for HSV-1 and HSV-2, respectively). These results show that C. micranthum is potentially more effective against HSV-1 than HSV-2.
