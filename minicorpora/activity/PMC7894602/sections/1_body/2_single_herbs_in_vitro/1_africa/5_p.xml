<p>Another group of researchers, Fortin et al.,

 </sup> studied a collection of medicinal plants from La Réunion Island that are traditionally used for ailments such as insomnia, diarrhea, hypertension, abdominal pain, skin manifestations, and fever. Methanolic extracts of each herb were tested against HSV-1 (strain H29). Of the 36 plants tested, 5 exhibited antiviral activity: Obetia ficifolia (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 7 μg/ml), Lomatophyllum macrum (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 64 μg/ml), Citrus hystrix (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 91 μg/ml), Erythroxylum laurifolium (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 125 μg/ml), and Senecio ambavilla (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 170 μg/ml). The authors also tested the antiviral activity of acyclovir and found its EC
 <sub>50</sub> to be 3.3 μg/ml. O. ficifolia and E. laurifolium were noted to have the strongest anti-HSV activity, but the authors did not further explain their reasoning for this remark.
