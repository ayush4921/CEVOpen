 </sup> tested 56 extracts of African medicinal plants for antiherpetic activity and found 6 to be effective against HSV-1 (Mclntyre strain). However, toxicity to green monkey kidney (GMK) cells was noted with increasing concentrations of each extract before 100% plaque reduction could be obtained. The extracts that exhibited anti-HSV activity in vitro were the dichloromethane extract of Chironia krebsii (EC range = 6.25-12.5 μg/ml); the 25% ethanolic extract of Jasminum fluminense (EC range = 50-200μg/ml); the methanolic extract of Mitragyna inermis (EC range = 50-100 μg/ml); the 25% ethanolic extract of Polygala virgata (EC range = 400-600 μg/ml); the methanolic extract of Securidaca longepedunculata (EC range = 12.5-25 μg/ml); and the 25% ethanolic extract of Securidaca longepedunculata (EC range = 2.5-6 μg/ml).
