 </sup> prepared an aqueous extract of Yin Chen Hao Tang, which consisted of 108 g Artemisia capillaries, 36 g Gardenia jasminoids, and 36 g Rheum officinale. The extract was tested against HSV-1 (strain KOS) and HSV-2 (strain 196 and strain G) and found to inhibit both viruses to different degrees. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> and SI values against HSV-1 ranged 145.5-150.1 μg/ml and 5.7-6.0, respectively. Antiviral activity was more potent against the HSV-2 strains, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> and SI values ranging 19.6-29.4 μg/ml and 28.9-43.4, respectively. Time-of-addition experiments revealed antiviral effects of the extract on HSV-2 were only noted when the extract was added simultaneously with the virus to cells or added 2 hours post-infection and presence maintained for 48 hours. In addition, pretreatment of HSV-2 virions with the extract showed to inhibit viral infectivity, and this inactivation was observed to be irreversible.
