 <caption> Monarda essential oils increase [Ca 2+] i in HEK transient receptor potential TRPA1 cells. Original representative traces demonstrating the dose-dependent effects of flower essential oil (MEO Fl) ( A) and leaf essential oil (MEO Lv) ( B). Arrows indicate the effects of 5 (#1), 10 (#2), 15 (#3), 20 (#4), and 25 (#5) µg/mL of the oils on [Ca 2+] i in HEK rTRPA1 cells. Summarized data for the dose-dependent increase in [Ca 2+] i are shown in ( C) and ( D). The data are represented as mean ± SEM ( n = 90 cells) from 3 independent experiments. </caption>
