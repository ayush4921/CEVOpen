 <caption> Monoterpenes do not induce increases in [Ca 2+] i in HEK cells expressing TRPV1 and TRPV4 channels. Representative traces demonstrating the unaltered [Ca 2+] i baseline in HEK hTRPV1 ( A) and HEK hTRPV4 ( B) in the presence of 100 µM of carvacrol (#2), thymol (#3), β-myrcene (#4), α-terpinene (#5), and γ-terpinene (#6). Capsaicin (#1), the MTRPV1 agonist, and GSK-1016790A (#7), the TRPV4 agonist, were used to confirm the expressions of the TRPV1 and TRPV4 channels, respectively. Summarized data are shown in ( C) and ( D) for TRPV1 and TRPV4 HEK cells, respectively. The data are expressed as change in the [Ca 2+] i influx from baseline to peak [Ca 2+] i and plotted as mean ± SEM. * p &lt; 0.0001 compared to agonist-induced [Ca 2+] i influx. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance; n = 90 cells from 3 independent experiments. </caption>
