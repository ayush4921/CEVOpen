<p>The structure of TRPA1 determined experimentally by electron cryo-microscopy [
 <xref rid="B60-molecules-25-04873" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] was downloaded from the Protein Data Bank (PDB code 3J9P) and imported into the Molegro Virtual Docker (MVD) program. The search space for docking was defined as a sphere of 8 Å in radius positioned at the geometric center of six residues in chain A (Tyr726, Ser780, Ser781, Ile811, Tyr812, and Tyr842) surrounding the reported binding site [
 <xref rid="B61-molecules-25-04873" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] for the docking of carvacrol. The spherical search space contained 26 residues (Ser725, Tyr726, Gly729, Leu730, Met733, Val777, Ser780, Ser781, Ile782, Phe783, Gly784, Leu807, Glu808, Ile810, Ile811, Tyr812, Thr813, Thr814, Gly815, Ala838, Phe841, Tyr842, Trp843, Asn845, Phe846, and Tyr849). Among these, Leu730 and Glu808 were not fully resolved in the experimental 3J9P structure downloaded from the PDB. These two residues were repaired and locally optimized using the “Protein preparation” utility incorporated in MVD.
