<p>GC analysis was performed using an Agilent 6890N GC system. To obtain the same elution order as with GC-MS, the line was split for FID and MS detectors, and a single injection was performed using the same column and appropriate operational conditions. Flame ionization detector (FID) temperature was 300 °C. The essential oil components were identified by co-injection with standards (whenever possible), which were purchased from commercial sources or isolated from natural sources. In addition, compound identities were confirmed by comparison of their mass spectra with those in the Wiley GC-MS Library (Wiley, NY, USA), MassFinder software 4.0 (Dr. Hochmuth Scientific Consulting, Hamburg, Germany), Adams Library, and National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST) Library. Confirmation was also achieved using the in-house “Başer Library of Essential Oil Constituents” database obtained from chromatographic runs of pure compounds performed with the same equipment and conditions.
