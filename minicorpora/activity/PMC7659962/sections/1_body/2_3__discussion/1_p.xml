<p>Essential oils isolated from 
 <italic>M. fistulosa</italic> represent a rich source of bioactive monoterpenes with a broad range of therapeutic potential, as summarized in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04873-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The genus 
 <italic>Monarda</italic> is represented by 20 native species, with 
 <italic>M. fistulosa</italic> (wild bergamot) essential oils being used medicinally to treat cardiovascular defects, wounds, colds and flu, gastrointestinal disorders, insomnia, and infant convulsions [

 <xref rid="B62-molecules-25-04873" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], Duke suggested that 
 <italic>M. fistulosa</italic> also has anticarcinogenic properties [
 <xref rid="B63-molecules-25-04873" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. In the present study, we defined the chemical profile of essential oils extracted from 
 <italic>M. fistulosa</italic> flowers (MEO
 <sub>Fl</sub>) and leaves (MEO
 <sub>Lv</sub>). We further evaluated the agonist properties of these essential oils and their pure monoterpene constituents on TRPA1, TRPV1, and TRPV4 ion channels in heterologous cell expression systems.
