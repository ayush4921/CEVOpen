0: A number of phytochemical studies on  Monarda species resulted in the identification of a wide spectrum of phytoconstituents, including phenolics [ 4, 5], triterpenoids [ 6], monoterpene glycosides [ 7], carbohydrate, carotenoids, and vitamin C [ 8], with the phenolic complex containing flavonoids [ 5], anthocyanins, and phenolic acids.
1: One compound specific to the  Monarda genus is monardaein [ 9].
2: However, the phytochemical data reported in the literature are insufficient to individuate any chemotaxonomic marker [ 3].
3: Essential oils of  Monarda species have been reported to be rich in oxygenated monoterpenes, leading to differentiation into the following chemotypes: thymol, carvacrol, borneol, and geraniol [ 10].
4: A literature survey regarding biological activities of the  Monarda species essential oils and their major compounds, based on references [ 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29], is summarized in  Table 1.
