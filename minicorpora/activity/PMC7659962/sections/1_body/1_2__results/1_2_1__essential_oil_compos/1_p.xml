<p>The chemical composition and biological activity of essential oils can be affected by many factors, including which part of the plant is used for essential oil isolation [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-25-04873" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Indeed, we observed differences in the essential oil composition in flowers and leaves from 
 <italic>Ferula iliensis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-25-04873" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and 
 <italic>Hypericum perforatum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-25-04873" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Thus, we extracted essential oils from 
 <italic>M. fistulosa</italic> flowers (MEO
 <sub>Fl</sub>) and leaves (MEO
 <sub>Lv</sub>). The MEO
 <sub>Fl</sub> and MEO
 <sub>Lv</sub> extraction yields (v/w) were 1.3% and 4.4%, respectively, which are much higher than those reported previously by Mattarelli et al. (0.33â€“0.50%) [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-25-04873" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The chemical composition of these essential oils was evaluated using gas chromatography-flame ionization detector (GC-FID) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) simultaneously, and
