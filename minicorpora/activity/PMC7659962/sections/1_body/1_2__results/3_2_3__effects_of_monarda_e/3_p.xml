<p>As with the experiments above using whole essential oil extracts, it is unlikely that the monoterpenes evaluated were cytotoxic, as no cytotoxicity was observed microscopically, and the cells responded robustly to the positive control agonists in all three transfected cell lines. In addition, we previously demonstrated that similar monoterpenes tested at 100 ÂµM had no effect on human MonoMac-6 monocytic cell viability [
