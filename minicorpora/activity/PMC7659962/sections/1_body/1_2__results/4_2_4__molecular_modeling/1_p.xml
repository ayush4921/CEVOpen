<p>We performed molecular docking studies on carvacrol, thymol, β-myrcene, and 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene using the human TRPA1 ion channel structure determined by electron cryo-microscopy (Protein Data Bank entry 3J9P [
 <xref rid="B60-molecules-25-04873" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]) as the target. The best docking pose for carvacrol (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04873-f007">Figure 7</xref>) was nearly the same as that obtained by Alvarenga and co-authors [
 <xref rid="B61-molecules-25-04873" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] using the AutoDock program. We identified the formation of a H-bond between the phenolic hydroxyl and Tyr812 of the protein. However, this H-bond is quite weak, and its contribution to the docking score is −0.372. It should be noted that the isopropyl groups of carvacrol and thymol, as well as the (CH
 <sub>3</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>C= fragment of β-myrcene, occupy the same area of space in the vicinity of the hydrophobic Ile811, Tyr812, and Tyr842 side chains. Hydroxyl groups of carvacrol and thymol are located close to each other in their superimposed docking poses and are directed to the OH and carboxyl groups of Tyr812 and Glu808, respectively. As for the inactive 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene, there was a noticeable difference in location of the molecule in the binding site when compared with the active compounds. There was a displacement of the 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene aromatic ring relative to the docking poses of the active aromatic compounds (carvacrol and thymol) and with respect to the location of the β-myrcene hydrocarbon chain.
