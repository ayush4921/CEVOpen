<p>To further confirm the selective agonist effects of 
 <italic>M. fistulosa</italic> essential oils on TRPA1 channels, parental HEK 293 cells were subjected to real-time calcium flux analysis in the presence of MEO

 <sub>i</sub> in parental HEK 293 cells are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04873-f004">Figure 4</xref>. TRP channel agonists AITC (100 µM, TRPA1), capsaicin (100 nM, TRPV1), and GSK-1016790A (10 µM, TRPV4) showed no significant changes in baseline [Ca

 <sub>i</sub> were observed when parental HEK 293 cells were treated with either MEO
 <sub>Fl</sub> or MEO
 <sub>Lv</sub> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04873-f004">Figure 4</xref>A). Receptor-effector coupling and cell viability were confirmed using ATP (25 µM) to induce transient increases in [Ca
