0: In recent years, our research group has developed callus and cell suspension cultures of  Satureja khuzistanica Jamzad (Lamiaceae), a rich source of RA [ 41, 42, 53, 54], for further scaling up and commercial production of this valuable natural antioxidant.
1: The present review is focused on the recent biotechnological and metabolic engineering achievements in the production of valuable natural antioxidants, with special emphasis on the use of  S. khuzistanica in vitro cultures as a chemical RA factory.
