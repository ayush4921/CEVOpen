0: The most important free radical in the human body is oxygen.
1: Superoxide (O 2), hydroxyl (OH ), and peroxyl (ROO ) radicals, and nonradical species such as hydrogen peroxide (H 2O 2) and singlet oxygen ( 1O 2) are common ROS generated from oxygen after an electron is taken up from surrounding molecules upon exposure to various environmental stresses, such as UV radiation, air pollution, and smoking [ 1, 5, 6].
2: ROS cause the destruction of cells, carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids [ 7, 8] and their activity in the human body weakens the immune system and leads to various diseases such as cancer, diabetes, heart failure, brain damage, muscle problems, premature aging, and eye injuries [ 9, 10].
