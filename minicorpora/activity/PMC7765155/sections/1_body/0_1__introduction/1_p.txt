0: Unhealthy modern lifestyles, marked by physical inactivity, obesity-inducing diets, and exposure to air pollution and other environmental and chemical stresses, are responsible for a wide range of diseases worldwide caused by excessive production of free radicals during biological metabolism [ 1, 2, 3].
1: Free radicals such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitrogen species are unstable molecules or atoms formed when an electron bond in a stable molecule is broken.
2: As they contain unpaired electrons in their last electron layer, they have an enhanced propensity to undergo chemical reactions [ 4].
3: Free radicals are ubiquitous in the living environment as well as in the human body, where they can cause irreparable damage to the surrounding tissues by destroying cells and releasing toxic substances [ 1].
