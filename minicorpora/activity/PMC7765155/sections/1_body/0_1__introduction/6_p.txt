0: The sensitivity of medicinal plants to environmental changes, their low contents of valuable SMs, and the costly extraction of these compounds from raw materials, questions the feasibility of biologically active compound production using plants [ 30].
1: Alternatively, the biotechnological production of SMs through in vitro plant cell, tissue, and organ culture is an efficient and faster method that guarantees stable and controlled conditions.
2: These in vitro techniques have been widely used for the production of several SMs, notably taxol [ 31, 32, 33], podophyllotoxin [ 34, 35, 36], withanolides [ 37], centellosides [ 38, 39], and rosmarinic acid (RA) [ 40, 41, 42, 43], as well as for mass propagation [ 44], in vitro cloning [ 45, 46, 47], and polyploidization [ 48, 49].
3: Many RA-producing biotechnological platforms have been established, based on shoots [ 50, 51, 52], callus [ 53], cells [ 41, 42, 54], and hairy root cultures [ 55, 56, 57, 58] of numerous species of the Boraginaceae, Anthocerotaceae, and Lamiaceae.
