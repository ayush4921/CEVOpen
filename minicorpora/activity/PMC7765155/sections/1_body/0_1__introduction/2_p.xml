<p>The most important free radical in the human body is oxygen. Superoxide (O
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>●−</sup>), hydroxyl (OH
 <sup>●</sup>), and peroxyl (ROO
 <sup>●</sup>) radicals, and nonradical species such as hydrogen peroxide (H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>) and singlet oxygen (
 <sup>1</sup>O
 <sub>2</sub>) are common ROS generated from oxygen after an electron is taken up from surrounding molecules upon exposure to various environmental stresses, such as UV radiation, air pollution, and smoking [
