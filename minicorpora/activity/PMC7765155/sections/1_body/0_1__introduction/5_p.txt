0: Primary metabolites such as nucleic acids, amino acids, proteins, carbohydrates, antioxidative enzymes, and fatty acids are essential for plant growth and survival [ 21].
1: Produced during photosynthesis, they participate in the production of cellular compounds.
2: In addition, plants synthesize a wide range of chemical compounds known as secondary metabolites (SMs) during their interactions with the environment, especially in response to biotic and abiotic stresses [ 22].
3: Based on their biosynthetic pathways and chemical structure, SMs are classified into different types (e.g.
4: terpenoids, alkaloids, phenolics, flavonoids, and steroids), and are widely used in the pharmaceutical, food, cosmetic, and agrochemical industries [ 23, 24].
5: The most important SMs are polyphenols, also called phenolic compounds, which are natural plant antioxidants.
6: To date, approximately ten thousand phenolic compounds have been identified and isolated from plant taxa [ 25].
7: Due to their antimicrobial and antioxidant activity [ 26, 27], plant-derived phenolic compound production from plant raw materials and by-products has attracted considerable attention over the last decades [ 28, 29].
