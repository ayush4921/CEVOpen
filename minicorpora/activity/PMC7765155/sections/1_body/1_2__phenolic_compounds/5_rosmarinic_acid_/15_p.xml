<p>RA is also reported to suppress the fibrosis process and improve the biochemical indicators and morphology of the pathological tissues in a rat model with liver fibrosis [
 <xref rid="B91-antioxidants-09-01273" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>], attributed to a negative effect on liver cytokines as well as the expression levels of a related gene. An apoptotic effect of RA has been described by Hur et al. [
 <xref rid="B92-antioxidants-09-01273" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>] and strong evidence presented for its anticancer activity, notably a metastasis inhibitory capacity, after long-term consumption of large amounts in the diet [

 <italic>S. khuzistanica</italic> cell suspensions have an apoptotic effect on MCF-7 cells through activation of the extrinsic pathway by increasing caspase 8 activity [
