<p>Caffeic acid is a structural unit of various types of secondary metabolites, ranging from the simplest monomers to multiple dense compounds and their oligomers. Trimers and tetramers of caffeic acid are reported to be therapeutic compounds with outstanding biological activities. Caffeic acid monomers are often found in the form of caffeic acid and 3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl) lactic acid [
