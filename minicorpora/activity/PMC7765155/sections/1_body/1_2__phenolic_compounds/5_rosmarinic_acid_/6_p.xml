<p>Phenylalanine is converted to 4-coumaroyl-CoA by the enzymes of the phenylpropanoid pathway: phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase (C4H), and 4-coumaric acid CoA-ligase (4CL). Tyrosine, with 2-oxoglutarate as a co-substrate, is transaminated by the pyridoxalphophate-dependent tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) to 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid (pHPP). Hydroxyphenylpyruvate reductase (HPPR) is the enzyme responsible for the NAD(P)H-dependent reduction of pHPP. This enzyme, considered to be the first specific key enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of RA, was first characterized in cell-free extracts obtained from suspension-cultured cells of
