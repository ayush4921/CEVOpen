<p>Only four of the enzymatic activities involved in this biosynthetic pathway seem to be specific to RA biosynthesis [
 <xref rid="B74-antioxidants-09-01273" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. The enzymes PAL, C4H, and 4CL belong to the general phenylpropanoid pathway and are highly prevalent in land plants, as they catalyze the precursors for the formation of lignin and other phenolic compounds. TAT is also considered as a primary enzyme because it forms pHPP, which is needed for the biosynthesis of tocopherols and plastoquinones [
