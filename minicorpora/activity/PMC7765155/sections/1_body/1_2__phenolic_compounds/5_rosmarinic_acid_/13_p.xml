<p>An outstanding property of RA is its antioxidant activity, which is based on its ability to stabilize membranes and prevent free radical movement, consequently protecting the membranes against oxidation [

 <xref rid="B86-antioxidants-09-01273" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>] showed that RA significantly reduced the generation of ROS and decreased the secretion of IL-6 from T cells and macrophages, thereby avoiding the UVB-induced formation of human keratinocytes. An important application of RA as an antioxidant is that it significantly decreases the side effects involving DNA/chromosome damage caused by the anticancer compound, doxorubicin [
