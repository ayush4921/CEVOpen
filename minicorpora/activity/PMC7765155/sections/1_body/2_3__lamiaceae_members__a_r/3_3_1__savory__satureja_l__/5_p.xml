This phenolic compound also inhibits prostaglandin biosynthesis, which is an important mechanism in relieving pain and anti-inflammatory processes. Other reported biological activities of carvacrol are antispasmodic, inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, lipid peroxidation, free radical scavenging, and macrophage stimulation of white blood cells [
