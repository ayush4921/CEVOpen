<p>The main components of 
 <italic>S. khuzistanica</italic> essential oil in the studied populations are carvacrol (93.9%), eugenol (1.0%), p-cymene (0.8%), and thymol (0.6%) [
 <xref rid="B123-antioxidants-09-01273" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]. This suggests that the populations of 
 <italic>S. khuzistanica</italic> are fundamentally homogeneous in their chemical composition. The essential oil constituents of other 
 <italic>Satureja</italic> species have also been studied, revealing the existence of chemotypes in these species. For example, Sefidkon et al. [
 <xref rid="B100-antioxidants-09-01273" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>] reported a chemical variation in 
 <italic>S. sahandica</italic> oils from different populations and identified thymol (19.6–41.7%), 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (32.5–54.9%), and γ-terpinene (1.0–12.8%) as the main oil constituents. Similarly, the essential oil composition of 
 <italic>S. montana</italic> showed significant variations in the concentration of its major components, i.e., carvacrol (5.0–69.0%), linalool (1.0–62.0%), γ-terpinene (1.0–31.0%), and 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (3.0–27.0%), indicating the existence of several chemotypes [
 <xref rid="B109-antioxidants-09-01273" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. The variability of the essential oil composition of the cultivated accessions of 
 <italic>S. hortensis</italic> has been recently reported [
 <xref rid="B124-antioxidants-09-01273" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>] and carvacrol (42.0–83.3%), γ-terpinene (0.5–28.5%), and 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (1.0–17.1%) were identified as the major components.
