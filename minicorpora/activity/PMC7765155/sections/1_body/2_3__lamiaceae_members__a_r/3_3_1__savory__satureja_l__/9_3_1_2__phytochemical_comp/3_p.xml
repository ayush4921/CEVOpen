<p>The caffeic acid ester RA is known to have cognitive-enhancing effects and can slow down the development of Alzheimerâ€™s disease. It also has cancer chemoprotection properties and anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antiviral activities [

 <italic>S. khuzistanica</italic> samples varies significantly among different populations [
 <xref rid="B115-antioxidants-09-01273" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>], in contrast with other phenols found in this plant species. Abdanan populations accumulate the highest levels of RA (1.81%), followed by those from Kaver (1.31%), while the lowest value has been obtained from Paalam populations (0.59%). Several authors suggest that RA is synthesized in response to stress produced under harsh environmental conditions or as a defense compound against plant pathogens [

 <xref rid="B126-antioxidants-09-01273" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>]. In accordance with this theory, the higher RA levels found in the Abdanan and Kaver populations may be explained by the very hot and dry conditions where the plants grow.
