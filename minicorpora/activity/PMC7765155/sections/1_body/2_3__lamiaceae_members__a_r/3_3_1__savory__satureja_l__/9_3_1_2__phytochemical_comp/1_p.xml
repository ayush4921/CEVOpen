<p>Eighteen compounds have been identified in the essential oil of 
 <italic>S. khuzistanica</italic> populations, representing 97.2–99.3% of the total oil composition [
 <xref rid="B115-antioxidants-09-01273" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. The main component in all studied populations is carvacrol, found in a high percentage. Carvacrol is thought to play an important role in the adaptation of 
 <italic>S. khuzistanica</italic> to harsh environmental conditions, such as a hot dry climate and calcareous, stony soils. The carvacrol precursors, 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene and γ-terpinene, have also been identified but in low concentrations. Carvacrol is a monoterpenoid phenol biosynthesized via the aromatization of γ-terpinene to 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene and then hydroxylated to 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene. This compound, with its two precursors, γ-terpinene and 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene, are the major components in several essential oils of the Lamiaceae family (e.g., in thyme, oregano, and savory oil). Carvacrol has a wide range of activities including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anticandidal properties [
