 <xref rid="B104-antioxidants-09-01273" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. The perennial 
 <italic>S. montana</italic> grows wild in Europe but not in Iran, whereas the annual 
 <italic>S. hortensis</italic>, traditionally cultivated in home gardens in different parts of Iran, is also widely grown and produced in France, Hungary, and Spain. Usually planted in early spring, it flowers until late June, when it is harvested at the full flowering stage to extract the essential oil [

 <italic>S. hortensis</italic> is more than six tons per hectare and its aerial parts can be harvested several times a year.
