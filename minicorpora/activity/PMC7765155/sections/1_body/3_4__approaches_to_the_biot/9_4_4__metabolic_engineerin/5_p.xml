<p>In this scenario, Xiao et al. [
 <xref rid="B198-antioxidants-09-01273" ref-type="bibr">198</xref>] overexpressed some genes encoding key enzymes in the biosynthesis of RA, SmHPPR (hydroxyphenylpyruvate reductase), SmC4H (cinnamic acid 4-hydrolase), and tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT), in hairy root cultures of 
 <italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza</italic> and observed higher RA accumulation in the transgenic lines. The highest levels of RA (992 mg L
 <sup>âˆ’1</sup>) were achieved when 
 <italic>hppr</italic> and 
 <italic>tat</italic> genes were co-overexpressed. These results were partially confirmed by Barberini et al. [
 <xref rid="B70-antioxidants-09-01273" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], who demonstrated that in cell suspension cultures of 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> RA biosynthesis is highly correlated with the expression of the 
 <italic>hppr</italic> gene, suggesting that this step could be a bottleneck for RA production in the cells and consequently a relevant target for new metabolic engineering approaches.
