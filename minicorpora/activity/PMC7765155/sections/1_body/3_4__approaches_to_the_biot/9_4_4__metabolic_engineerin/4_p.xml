<p>Enhanced activities of PAL and TAT have been demonstrated in high RA-producing cell lines of 
 <italic>S. milthorriza</italic> elicited with MeJA [
 <xref rid="B194-antioxidants-09-01273" ref-type="bibr">194</xref>], showing that increasing the precursor of both committed pathways in RA biosynthesis could be a successful strategy to increase its biotechnological production. On the contrary, in YE-elicited hairy root cultures of 
 <italic>S. miltiorrhiza</italic> TAT activity rose notably, whereas PAL activity decreased rapidly [
 <xref rid="B195-antioxidants-09-01273" ref-type="bibr">195</xref>]. In the same system, HPPR gene expression was correlated with higher RA production for the first time [
 <xref rid="B196-antioxidants-09-01273" ref-type="bibr">196</xref>]. This was subsequently confirmed by Zhang et al. [
 <xref rid="B197-antioxidants-09-01273" ref-type="bibr">197</xref>], who found that a high RA production is more closely correlated with the activation of the enzymes involved in the tyrosine-derived pathway than with those related with the phenylpropanoid pathway.
