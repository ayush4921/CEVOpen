<p>An increase in PAL activity has been reported in elicited cells of 
 <italic>C. blumei</italic> as well as in the activity of the specific RA biosynthetic enzyme RAS [
 <xref rid="B153-antioxidants-09-01273" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>]. The limiting role of the PAL pathway was further confirmed by Kim et al. [
 <xref rid="B193-antioxidants-09-01273" ref-type="bibr">193</xref>], who demonstrated that PAL, 4CL, and C4H were more active in 
 <italic>Agastache rugosa</italic> cell cultures elicited with MeJA.
