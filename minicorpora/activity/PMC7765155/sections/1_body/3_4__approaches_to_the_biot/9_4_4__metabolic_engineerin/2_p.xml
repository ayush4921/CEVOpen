<p>One challenge in plant metabolic engineering is to find enzymes that limit the precursor-flow in metabolic pathways and may therefore be suitable targets for engineering. In this regard, in vitro plant cultures can constitute an excellent platform for basic studies and to identify bottlenecks in a SM pathway. It has been demonstrated that in elicited cell suspensions and hairy root cultures, high RA production is correlated with a high transcript accumulation of genes encoding key enzymes involved in RA biosynthesis. </p>
