<p>Transgenic plants of 
 <italic>Perilla frutesces</italic> overexpressing the tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) gene were obtained by 
 <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>-mediated transformation with the vector pCAMBIA23400-35S, which contains PfTAT under the control of the 35S promoter [

 <xref rid="B200-antioxidants-09-01273" ref-type="bibr">200</xref>] based on “increasing income and reducing expenditure”. To perform this, the Arabidopsis Production of an Anthocyanin Pigment transcription factor (AtPAP1) under the control of the 35S promoter was overexpressed in the high RA-producing plant species 
 <italic>S. miltorrizha</italic>. AtPAP1 belongs to the MYB family of transcription factors and controls anthocyanin biosynthesis in plant tissues (
