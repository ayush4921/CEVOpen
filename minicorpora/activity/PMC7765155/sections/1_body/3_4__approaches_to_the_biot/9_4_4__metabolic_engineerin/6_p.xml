<p>In hairy root cultures of 
 <italic>C. blumei</italic>, overexpression of 
 <italic>hppr</italic> and 
 <italic>ras</italic> genes had controversial effects. Three hairy root lines harboring the 
 <italic>hppr</italic> gene under the control of the 35S-promotor were obtained, two lines showing a higher accumulation of the 
 <italic>hppr</italic> transcript than the control (untransformed) lines. High expression levels of the gene were correlated with an enhanced production of RA, which was up to 176% higher than in the control cultures. In contrast, expression of the 
 <italic>ras</italic> gene in transformed roots carrying the 
 <italic>ras</italic> overexpression construct did not increase and their RA production was generally lower than in the control root lines. The reduced expression of both genes in some of the hairy root clones obtained was attributed by the authors to co-suppression effects.
