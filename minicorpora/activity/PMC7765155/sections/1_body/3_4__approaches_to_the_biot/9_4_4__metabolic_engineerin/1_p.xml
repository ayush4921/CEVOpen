<p>Plant metabolic engineering offers a set of tools for overexpressing or silencing genes to modulate carbon flux in a biosynthetic pathway by targeting single steps. Alternatively, the expression of regulatory genes can be modified to establish multiple controls over one or more pathways in the cells (

As previously mentioned, the biosynthetic pathway of RA is well elucidated, but its regulation remains unclear, which is probably why only single-step and not holistic approaches have been developed until now for improving RA biotechnological production by means of metabolic engineering tools.
