<p>Recently, functional genomics (including transcriptomics and proteomics) synergically coupled with metabolomics have led to a systems biology approach, which potentially allows a full exploration of the biochemical machinery of plant cells and consequently their biosynthetic capacity can be more efficiently exploited [

 <italic>Taxus media</italic> cell cultures elicited with methyl jasmonate (MeJA), this approach recently enabled the isolation of 667 gene sequence tags (using cDNA-amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis (cDNA-AFLP) whose expression was modulated by the elicitor. A new gene was cloned from these tags and expressed in vitro and the results allowed the identification of Taximin, a new master regulator of taxane biosynthesis that could be used to improve the biotechnological production of taxol in 
 <italic>Taxus</italic> sp. cell cultures [
