<p>Thus, in most cases, the combined use of elicitors and permeabilizing agents can enhance SM biotechnological production [
 <xref rid="B188-antioxidants-09-01273" ref-type="bibr">188</xref>] and could represent a suitable approach for increasing RA production in plant cell cultures of different plant species. It has been shown that elicitation of plant cell cultures with MeJA and CD enhances the accumulation of other phenolic compounds, such as resveratrol in 
 <italic>Vitis vinifera</italic> [
 <xref rid="B183-antioxidants-09-01273" ref-type="bibr">183</xref>] and silymarin in 
 <italic>Silybum marianum</italic>. The production of other types of plant SMs has also been increased by this joint treatment, for example, aromadendrene in 
 <italic>Capsicum annuun</italic> cell cultures [
 <xref rid="B189-antioxidants-09-01273" ref-type="bibr">189</xref>], taraxasterol in 
 <italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B190-antioxidants-09-01273" ref-type="bibr">190</xref>], ajmalicine in 
 <italic>C. roseus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B191-antioxidants-09-01273" ref-type="bibr">191</xref>], and most recently taxol and related taxanes in 
 <italic>T. media</italic> cell cultures [
 <xref rid="B189-antioxidants-09-01273" ref-type="bibr">189</xref>]. In the same way, the joint application of COR or MeJA and CD dramatically increased the taxane production in 
 <italic>T. globosa</italic> and 
 <italic>T. media</italic> cell cultures [

 <xref rid="B192-antioxidants-09-01273" ref-type="bibr">192</xref>]. These studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of this combined treatment and suggest it has the potential to improve the production of other SMs such as RA. Accordingly, Khojasteh et al. [
 <xref rid="B54-antioxidants-09-01273" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] demonstrated that in MeJA-elicited 
 <italic>S. khuzistanica cell</italic> cultures treated with CDs only a small quantity of RA accumulated in the culture medium, and its cell content decreased significantly, probably due to the degradation of the bioactive compound by cellular apoplasts when released to the culture medium.
