<p>As mentioned above, despite the interest of RA and the extensive published work on its biotechnological production in plant cell and hairy root cultures, very few studies have been carried out at bioreactor level, and these studies have mostly been performed in reusable bioreactors. In recent years, reusable bioreactors have been replaced by disposable single-use bioreactors operating with a plastic bag or rigid plastic vessel. Currently plant cell cultures are being grown in disposable single-use bioreactors with volumes up to 400 L for the production of high-value compounds such as proteins and secondary metabolites [

 <xref rid="B170-antioxidants-09-01273" ref-type="bibr">170</xref>]. These features can be attributed to the plastic materials of the plant cell culture bags, which are made from multilayered, gamma-irradiated films in the majority [
