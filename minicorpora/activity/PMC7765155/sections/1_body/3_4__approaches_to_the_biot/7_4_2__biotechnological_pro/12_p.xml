<p>In addition to the mechanically driven disposable bioreactor types, pneumatically driven bubble columns are used for plant cell suspension cultures. In the more simply designed disposable bubble columns, mass and heat transfer is achieved by direct sparging of air/gas into tall cultivation containers. The resulting bubbling causes mixing and fluid circulation of the culture medium. A modification of the bubble column is the airlift bioreactor, which has inner draft tubes to improve the mixing and aeration of the culture broth [
