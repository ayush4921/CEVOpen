<p>In 
 <italic>Lavandula vera</italic> MM cell suspensions, the effect of the temperature (T) on growth and RA production was investigated in a stirred bioreactor of 3 L, showing that a T lower than 26 °C was not suitable for biomass and RA production [
 <xref rid="B166-antioxidants-09-01273" ref-type="bibr">166</xref>]. The best production was achieved when cells were cultivated at 30 °C. In the same system, the relationship between dissolved oxygen (DO) and the agitation rate was also investigated. After 12 days of culture, the cell suspension accumulated the highest amounts of biomass (34.8 g L
 <sup>−1</sup>) when 50% DO was supplied and the agitation rate was 100 rpm, whereas the highest RA production (1.8 g L
 <sup>−1</sup>) was achieved with 30% DO and an agitation speed of 300 rpm [
