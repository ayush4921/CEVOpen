<p>The systematic optimization of culture conditions for the biotechnological production of RA has been scarcely investigated. One exception is the work carried out by the Pavlov group [
 <xref rid="B168-antioxidants-09-01273" ref-type="bibr">168</xref>], who developed and applied a polynomial regression model to describe the production of RA in a stirred 3 L tank, taking into account the DO concentration, agitation, and temperature. This was followed by a statistical optimization using a simple modified method. In optimized conditions, RA productivity was 3.5 g L
 <sup>−1</sup>, 2-fold higher than in the shake-flask stage, the optimal culture conditions being 50% air saturation, 400 rpm, and 29.9 °C.
