<p>Although the different wave-mixed bioreactor types are based on an identical working principle, they differ considerably in the culture bag design (bag material, scale and dimension, and the type of employed sensor probes and filters) and in the platform movement [
 <xref rid="B178-antioxidants-09-01273" ref-type="bibr">178</xref>]. Wave-mixed bioreactors are currently the most favoured disposable bioreactors for many plant cell cultures grown at pilot scale up to 100 L working volume (this is sufficient for the manufacture of bioactive substances for cosmetics industry and also selected products for pharmaceutical applications. For example, Mibelle Biochemistry and Sederma have already developed and manufactured bioactive products for cosmetics, such as Phyto Cell Tec Argan, Solar, Vitis, Malus domestica, Alp Rose and RESISTEM. Greenovation also uses this type of bioreactors to produce different therapeutic proteins in

 <sup>®</sup> CultiBag RM have been successfully used for the culture of, among others,

 <italic>Hyoscyamus muticus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Panax ginseng</italic> [
