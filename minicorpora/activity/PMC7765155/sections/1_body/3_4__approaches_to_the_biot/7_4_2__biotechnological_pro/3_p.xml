<p>A wide variety of bioreactor designs have been used for the cultivation of plant cells. Traditional bioreactor configurations, such as stirred tank, bubble column or airlift bioreactors, have been utilized successfully for the production of phytochemicals in plant cell factories. Bioreactor design depends on whether the biosynthesis of the target compound is growth- or non-growth-associated and where the product is stored, either within the cell or secreted. If a plant secondary metabolite is produced during the exponential growth phase, only one reactor is normally required for growth and product recovery, but if the desired compound is synthesized after the cell growth phase, one reactor can be used during the exponential growth to increase cell biomass, and another one for metabolite production during the stationary phase, but currently also this is possible by using only a biorreactor by decoupling growth and production [

When the secondary compound accumulates inside the cell, the bioreactor is usually run-in batch or fed-batch (feeding) mode so that the cells can be permeabilized to release the product after the run is completed. If the product is secreted to the media, a continuous bioreactor can be used, and the compounds of interest can be removed as they are synthesized [
