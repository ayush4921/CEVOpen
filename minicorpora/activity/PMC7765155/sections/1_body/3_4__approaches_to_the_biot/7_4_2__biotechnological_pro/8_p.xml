<p>Considerable progress has been made in the biotechnological production of RA, although much more work is still necessary. Key strategies for speeding up the process development and enhancing the biotechnological production of RA include the implementation of disposable bioreactors in fermentation procedures, the use of new elicitors and/or permeabilizing agents, as well as attempting to develop metabolic engineering approaches for the design of new cell lines with an improved capacity to biosynthesize/accumulate RA.</p>
