<p>Plant cells are more sensitive to shear forces than microbial cells, and this fact conditions the stirring and aeration inside the bioreactor vessel [
 <xref rid="B24-antioxidants-09-01273" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The growth of plant cells is slower compared to microorganism cells and during the culture period they often release significant amounts of polysaccharides, increasing the viscosity of the culture medium. This may result in mass transfer limitations. Therefore, in many cases the design of the bioreactors has to be modified and adapted to the typical traits of the plant cell cultures in order to overcome these difficulties and implement the bioreactor systems at an industrial level (
