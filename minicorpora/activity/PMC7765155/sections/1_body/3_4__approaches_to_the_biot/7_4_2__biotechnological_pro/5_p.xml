<p>The biotechnological production of RA has been carried out using different bioreactor types. 
 <italic>Anchusa officinalis</italic> cell suspensions were cultivated in a stirred prototype bioreactor (2.3 L working volume) with an internal crossflow filter working as an automated perfusion device, where the cells were retained while fresh medium was and spent medium was removed. In this bioreactor a two-stage culture was successfully performed and after a culture period of 17 days the harvested biomass was 26 g DW L
 <sup>−1</sup> and RA productivity 94 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup> day, a productivity 3-fold higher than achieved in a batch mode [

 <italic>A. officinalis</italic> was cultivated in batch mode for 10 days in B5 medium supplemented with 3% sucrose and 0.25 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup> NAA, followed by perfusing the culture with B5 medium with the sucrose concentration increased to 6 % at a constant perfusion rate of 0.1 day
