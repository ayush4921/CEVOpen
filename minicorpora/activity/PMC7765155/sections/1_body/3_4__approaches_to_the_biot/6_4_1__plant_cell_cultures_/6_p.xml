<p>Other reported sources of RA are calli and cell suspensions of

 <italic>A. rugosa</italic> reached the maximum growth and RA production when cultured in B5 liquid medium together with 2 mg L

 <italic>E. sericeum</italic> root lines derived spontaneously from calli produced up to 4.50% DW of RA, whereas the original callus line achieved only 2.04% [
