0: Modern lifestyle factors, such as physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and exposure to environmental pollution, induce excessive generation of free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the body.
1: These by-products of oxygen metabolism play a key role in the development of various human diseases such as cancer, diabetes, heart failure, brain damage, muscle problems, premature aging, eye injuries, and a weakened immune system.
2: Synthetic and natural antioxidants, which act as free radical scavengers, are widely used in the food and beverage industries.
3: The toxicity and carcinogenic effects of some synthetic antioxidants have generated interest in natural alternatives, especially plant-derived polyphenols (e.g., phenolic acids, flavonoids, stilbenes, tannins, coumarins, lignins, lignans, quinines, curcuminoids, chalcones, and essential oil terpenoids).
4: This review focuses on the well-known phenolic antioxidant rosmarinic acid (RA), an ester of caffeic acid and (  R)-(+)-3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl) lactic acid, describing its wide distribution in thirty-nine plant families and the potential productivity of plant sources.
5: A botanical and phytochemical description is provided of a new rich source of RA,   Satureja khuzistanica Jamzad (Lamiaceae).
6: Recently reported approaches to the biotechnological production of RA are summarized, highlighting the establishment of cell suspension cultures of   S. khuzistanica as an RA chemical biofactory.
