0: The use of plants or their isolated bioactive components for the prevention and treatment of various disorders has been developed.
1: Here, we aim to identify effective medicinal plants for relief of cough and respiratory symptoms in children.
2: The data of this review article were obtained from published articles in scientific databases, including PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus, until December 2019.
3: The keywords, including   Zataria multiflora Boiss.
4: OR   Portulaca oleracea L. OR   Ferula assa-foetida L. OR   Nigella sativa L. AND respiratory symptoms OR airway inflammation OR smooth muscle relaxant effects, were searched individually or combined.
5: The mentioned medicinal plants decreased total white blood cell (WBC), neutrophils, and eosinophils counts of blood and lung lavage in animal model-induced respiratory disorders.
6: These plants also have protective effects on serum immunoglobulin, antibody titer, eosinophil count, and proinflammatory cytokines.
7: Evidence from the studies indicated that the abovementioned medicinal plants have smooth muscle relaxant properties (bronchodilator effects) via stimulation of   -adrenoceptor or inhibition of muscarinic receptors (  in vitro) and also improved the pulmonary function test in clinical settings.
8: These medicinal plants are safe and easy to use.
9: Based on the anti-inflammatory, anti-antispasmodic, and immunomodulatory effects, the clinical benefit may be assumed, therefore considering a place for these medicinal plants in relieve of chronic cough and symptoms of children's allergy, asthma, and common cold.
