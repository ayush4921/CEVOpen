<p>The relaxant effect of the aqueous extract of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> (0.25, 0.5, and 1 g %) on the guinea pig's isolated trachea chain was also examined. The extract of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> compared with saline showed a dose-dependent stimulatory effect on 
 <italic>β</italic>2-adrenoceptors and eventually led to tracheal smooth muscles relaxation [

 <italic>N. sativa</italic> (0.8, 1.2, 1.6, and 2.0 g%) showed significant relaxant effects on precontracted guinea pig tracheal chains by KCl (60 mM) and methacholine (10
