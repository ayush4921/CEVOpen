0: The chemical profile, antiproliferative, antioxidant and antiphytoviral activities of the species   Hypericum perforatum ssp.
1: veronense (Schrank) H. Lindb.
2: (Clusiaceae) were investigated.
3: Free volatiles were isolated and the chemical composition was determined in the lipophilic fraction (essential oil) and for the first time in the water fraction (hydrosol).
4: The aim is to provide phytochemical data for   H. perforatum ssp.
5: veronense useful for distinguishing ssp.
6: veronense from ssp.
7: angustifolium, as there are taxonomic disagreements between them and the composition of the secretory products may be helpful in this respect.
8: In the essential oil, the most abundant compounds identified were -pinene and   n-nonane, while in the hydrosol, myrtenol, carvacrol and -pinene were the most abundant.
9: Overall, the class of monoterpenes and oxygenated monoterpenes dominated in the EO and hydrosol samples.
10: The essential oil showed high antioxidant activity, in contrast to the antiproliferative activity, where the hydrosol showed exceptional activity against three cancer cell lines: Hela (cervical cancer cell line), HCT116 (human colon cancer cell line) and U2OS (human osteosarcoma cell line).
11: Both the essential oil and hydrosol showed antiphytoviral activity against tobacco mosaic virus infection on the local host plants.
12: This is the first report dealing with biological activities of hydrosol of   H. perforatum ssp.
13: veronense, and the obtained results suggest that this traditional medicinal plant is a valuable source of volatiles with promising antiproliferative, antioxidant and antiphytoviral activities.
