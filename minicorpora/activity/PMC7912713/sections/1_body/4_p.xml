<p>The possibility offered by biofilms to hit drug-resistant infections is the focus of the contribution by Seyler et al. [
 <xref rid="B1-antibiotics-10-00141" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Biofilm indeed represents an innovative target for the control of resistant strains. The authors reveal new anti-infective molecule-inhibiting biofilm growth by targeting the tRNA-dependent regulated T-box genes modulating the expression of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and amino acid metabolism genes. Active molecules were identified via in silico screening and validated in vivo, whereby the growth of 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> in biofilms was inhibited 10-fold more potently than by vancomycin. Moreover, for the identified compounds, synergy was detected when administered in combination with gentamicin and rifampin. The selected target and the results obtained highlight the importance of hitting critical and specific bacterial functions that are absent in human hosts but required for bacterial cell viability. T-box is a unique target that could be exploited in the development of small-molecule antibacterial biofilm therapies against virulent and drug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens.
