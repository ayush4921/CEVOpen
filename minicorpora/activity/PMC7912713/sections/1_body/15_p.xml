<p>Cryptic and druggable sites recently found on BLs, as well as identified allosteric effectors are discussed by the authors. However, challenging questions remain open, i.e., the lack of consensus on the chemical features a ligand should have for behaving as an allosteric inhibitor and the difficulty in impairing cross-class activity because of the different structures and folding characteristics among different BLs.</p>
