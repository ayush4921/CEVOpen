 <p>The aim of the present research was to determine the chemical composition and the cytotoxic effects of 
  <italic>Tetraclinis articulata</italic> trunk bark essential oil (HEE) obtained by steam distillation and five fractions obtained by normal phase silica chromatographic separation. Chemical analysis allowed the identification of 54 known compounds. Relatively high amounts of oxygenated sesquiterpenes (44.4–70.2%) were detected, mainly consisting of caryophyllene oxide (13.1–26.6%), carotol (9.2–21.2%),14-hydroxy-9-
  <italic>epi</italic>-(
  <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene (3.2–15.5%) and humulene epoxide II (2.6–7.2%). The cytotoxic activity against human mammary carcinoma cell lines (MDA-MB-231) and colorectal carcinoma cell lines (SW620) of the essential oil and its fractions were assessed. All the samples displayed moderate to weak activity compared to 5-fluorouracil. The colorectal carcinoma cell line was relatively more sensitive to the essential oil and its fractions compared to the breast cancer cell line, showing IC
  <sub>50</sub> values from 25.7 to 96.5 μg/mL. In addition, the essential oil and its fraction E.2 revealed a cytotoxic activity against colorectal carcinoma cell line, with IC
  <sub>50</sub> values lower than 30 μg/mL. This is the first report on the chemical composition and cytotoxic activity of the trunk bark essential oil of 
  <italic>T. articulata</italic>.
