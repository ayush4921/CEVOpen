<p>Medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs), in their entirety or their separated parts, are used as they are or can be further processed by extraction of essential oils and are considered an important resource in various fields, such as pharmaceutical, flavor and fragrance, perfumery, and cosmetic industries [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-26-01110" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Essential oils from medicinal and aromatic plants are a very interesting source of secondary metabolites because of their many different biological properties, such as cytotoxic [

In recent years, the development of antibiotic resistance represents the major issue in medical microbiology and the search for new weapons against antibiotic resistances has led to the search of new sources of potential antimicrobials. Among them, the plant kingdom offers a wide range of biodiversity with a great value for the pharmaceutical industry. In Tunisia and in other North African countries, MAPs in human and veterinary medicine are mainly used for respiratory and intestinal infections in children, and in the treatment of gastric pains, diabetes, hypertension, diarrhea and rheumatism [

 <italic>Tetraclinis articulata</italic> (Vahl) Masters (synonyms:

 <italic>Tetraclinis articulata</italic> organs (nonwoody branches, wood branches, wood, cones, roots, leaves, fruits and seeds) so far have exhibited wide variability in their major compounds, the most commonly encountered ones being monoterpene hydrocarbons, such as α-pinene in leaves, fruits and cones (Algeria and Tunisia) [
