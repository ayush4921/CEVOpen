<p>Trunk bark of 
 <italic>T. articulata</italic> (750 g) was cut into little pieces and subjected to steam distillation over 4 h using a Clevenger-type system. The essential oil (HEE) obtained was decanted, dried over anhydrous Na
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> and stored in sealed glass vials at 4–5 °C until chemical and biological analysis. The essential oil (300 mg) was fractionated on a column of silica gel using a hexane/ethyl acetate step gradient (95:5; 90:10; 80:20; 70:30) to afford five fractions (E.1–E.5): fraction E.1 (137 mg, 45.7% of oil); fraction E.2 (37 mg, 12.4% of oil); fraction E.3 (28 mg, 9.4% of oil); fraction E.4 (22 mg, 7.4% of oil); fraction E.5 (46 mg, 15.4% of oil). These fractions (E.1–E.5) were also submitted to gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry.
