<p>The composition of HEE and its five fractions was determined by Gas Chromatography/Electron Ionization-Mass Spectrometry (GC-EI-MS). Analyses were carried out with a Varian CP-3800 gas chromatograph (Varian Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA) fitted with an HP-5 capillary column (30 m, 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm film thickness) coupled with a Varian Saturn (Varian Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA) 2000 ion-trap mass detector. Operating conditions were as follows: injector temperature, 220 °C; transfer line temperature, 240 °C; oven temperature, 60 to 240 °C (set to a 3 °C/min increment), carrier gas: helium at a 1 mL/min flow. After dilution (5%) in HPLC-grade 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane, 1 µL was injected in the GC (split ratio 1:30). The acquisition was performed with the following parameters: full scan, with a scan range of 35–300 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic>; scan time: 1.0 s; threshold: 1 count. The identification of the constituents was based on the comparison of their retention times (t
 <sub>R</sub>) with those of pure reference samples and of their linear retention indices (LRIs), which were determined relative to the t
 <sub>R</sub> of a series of 
 <italic>n</italic>-alkanes (C
 <sub>9</sub>–C
 <sub>25</sub>). The mass spectra detected were compared with those listed in the commercial libraries NIST 14 and ADAMS, and in a homemade mass-spectral library, built from pure substances and components of essential oils of known composition and MS literature data [
