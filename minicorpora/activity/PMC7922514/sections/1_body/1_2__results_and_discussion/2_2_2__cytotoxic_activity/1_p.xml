<p>To determine whether 
 <italic>T. articulata</italic> trunk bark essential oil and its fractions could exert a cytotoxic action, we exposed MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and SW620 colon cancer cells to increasing amounts of tested agents (0 to 100 µg/mL) for 48 h, prior to a cell viability assay (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-01110-f002">Figure 2</xref>). A dose-dependent cytotoxic activity was shown against both cell lines with the SW620 cells being more sensitive to all tested fractions. Several reports highlighted the expression of multidrug resistance proteins in MDA-MB-231 cell line [

 <xref rid="B29-molecules-26-01110" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The complete essential oil of 
 <italic>T. articulata</italic> displayed the highest inhibitory activity against SW620 and MDA-MB-231 cells with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 25.7 and 83.0 µg/mL, respectively. Interestingly, fraction E.2 was most active against SW620 cells and E.3 was most active against MDA cells. The essential oil of 
 <italic>T. articulata</italic> trunk bark, and its fractions, showed low cytotoxicity towards both cell lines, compared to the positive control used. According to American National Cancer Institute, however, extracts with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values below 30 μg/mL against experimental cancer cell lines may represent promising anticancer agents for further drug development [
