<p>The chemical composition of 
 <italic>T. articulata</italic> trunk bark complete essential oil (HEE) and its fractions (E.1–E.5) is dominated by oxygenated sesquiterpenes (44.4–70.2%). Caryophyllene oxide, carotol and 14-hydroxy-
 <italic>epi</italic>-(
 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene were determined as the major components. HEE and its fractions (E.1–E.5) did not exhibit substantial cytotoxic activity against human cell line MDA-MB-231 and SW640.The increasing content of oxygenated sesquiterpenes correlated with an increase of the cytotoxicity.
