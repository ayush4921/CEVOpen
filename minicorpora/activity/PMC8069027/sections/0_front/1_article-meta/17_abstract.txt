0: Essential oils prevent superbug formation, which is mainly caused by the continuous use of synthetic drugs.
1: This is a significant threat to health, the environment, and food safety.
2: Plant extracts in the form of essential oils are good enough to destroy pests and fight bacterial infections in animals and humans.
3: In this review article, different essential oils containing polymeric nanofibers fabricated by electrospinning are reviewed.
4: These nanofibers containing essential oils have shown applications in biomedical applications and as food-packaging materials.
5: This approach of delivering essential oils in nanoformulations has attracted considerable attention in the scientific community due to its low price, a considerable ratio of surface area to volume, versatility, and high yield.
6: It is observed that the resulting nanofibers possess antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties.
7: Therefore, they can reduce the use of toxic synthetic drugs that are utilized in the cosmetics, medicine, and food industries.
8: These nanofibers increase barrier properties against light, oxygen, and heat, thereby protecting and preserving the food from oxidative damage.
9: Moreover, the nanofibers discussed are introduced with naturally derived chemical compounds in a controlled manner, which simultaneously prevents their degradation.
10: The nanofibers loaded with different essential oils demonstrate an ability to increase the shelf-life of various food products while using them as active packaging materials.
