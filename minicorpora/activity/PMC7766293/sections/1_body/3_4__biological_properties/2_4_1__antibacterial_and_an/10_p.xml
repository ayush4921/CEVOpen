<p>Rapid antibacterial screening of essential oils using the agar diffusion technique is usually conducted. However, the lack of standardized methods makes direct comparison of results between studies difficult [
 <xref rid="B57-pharmaceuticals-13-00479" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The problems related to oils dispersion and lipophilic constituents in aqueous media, and varying methods for determining numbers of viable bacteria remaining after the addition of the oil were the main causes of unreliability and inconsistent results obtained from disc diffusion, well diffusion, and agar dilution methods. Nevertheless, the broth dilution method, using emulsifier, seems to be the most accurate method for testing the antimicrobial activity of the hydrophobic and viscous essential oils.
