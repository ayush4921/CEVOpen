<p>In a recent study, a 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> aqueous decoction and hydroethanolic extract presented a dose and time-dependent inhibitory effect on the cell viability of a human colon adenocarcinoma (Caco-2) cell line and human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cell line. The hydroethanolic extract presented higher antiproliferative activity/cytotoxicity on Caco-2 cells (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 71.18 and 51.30 μg/mL after 24 and 48 h of incubation, respectively) than the aqueous decoction extracts (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 220.68 and 95.65 μg/mL after 24 and 48 h of incubation, respectively), which was correlated with its higher phenolic content. In addition, it should be noted that the Caco-2 cells were more sensitive than HepG2 cells, as it presented lower IC
 <sub>50</sub> values for both extracts [
