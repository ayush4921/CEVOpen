<p>The antioxidant activity of 14 populations of 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> methanolic extracts grown in an experimental plot was analyzed by DPPH and FRAP assays to determine antioxidant activity. Population means for DPPH activity ranges were 44–98 mg TE/g dry weight (DW), while FRAP antioxidant capacity was 52–115 mg of Trolox equivalents (TE)/g DW. In general, populations with high DPPH free radical scavenging assay also showed high FRAP antioxidant activity and vice-versa. In this study, the rosmarinic acid contributed mainly to the FRAP antioxidant capacity and total phenolic content, while the unknown compound (peak 3) contributed mainly to the DPPH assay. This study showed high intrapopulation variability and, above all, high interpopulation variability [
