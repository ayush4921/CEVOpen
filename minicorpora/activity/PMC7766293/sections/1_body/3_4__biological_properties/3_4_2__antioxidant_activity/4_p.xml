<p>To determine the antioxidant activity in plant extracts, four different methods were used: the DPPH radical scavenging assay, the TBARS assay in brain homogenates, the FRAP assay of ferric iron (Fe
 <sup>3+</sup>) to ferrous iron (Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>), and the system β-carotene/linoleic acid based on the inhibition of β-carotene bleaching in the presence of linoleic acid radicals. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> in the β-carotene/linoleic acid assay was achieved at a value of 0.90 mg/mL, in the DPPH radical scavenging assay, the value obtained was 0.69 mg/mL, the TBARS assay yielded a value of 0.43 mg/mL, and in the FRAP assay, the lowest value was obtained at 0.23 mg/mL [
