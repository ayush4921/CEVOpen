<p>As Asensio-S.-Manzanera et al. [
 <xref rid="B33-pharmaceuticals-13-00479" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] reported, the DPPH and FRAP assays were used to evaluate the antioxidant activity on dry plant extracts of 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> and dry residues after hydrodistillation. In the dry plant extracts, a scavenging effect was observed through the assays of DPPH (EC
 <sub>50</sub> 0.59–1.78 mg/mL) and FRAP (EC
 <sub>50</sub> 0.77–2.05 mg/mL). While for the hydrodistilled residue, the EC
 <sub>50</sub> values were higher, showing less antioxidant activity. These results could be related to the higher phenol content in the dry extracts compared with the hydrodistilled residue, indicating that a considerable amount of antioxidants were retained in the remaining hydrodistilled water and 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> essential oil.
