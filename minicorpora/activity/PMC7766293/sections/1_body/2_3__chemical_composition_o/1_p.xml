<p>The essential oil of

Other extraction methods were also used, such as microdistillation, that showed higher amounts of 1,8-cineole plus limonene in comparison with hydrodistillation. However, in general, few differences were found between the different methodologies. The yield may vary depending on several factors, namely the part of the plant used, place of harvest, period of the year, storage time, extraction time, and type of fertilization, among others [
