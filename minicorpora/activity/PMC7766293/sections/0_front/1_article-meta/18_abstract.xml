  <italic>Thymus mastichina</italic> has the appearance of a semishrub and can be found in jungles and rocky lands of the Iberian Peninsula. This work aimed to review and gather available scientific information on the composition and biological properties of 
  <italic>T. mastichina</italic>. The main constituents of 
  <italic>T. mastichina</italic> essential oil are 1,8-cineole (or eucalyptol) and linalool, while the extracts are characterized by the presence of flavonoids, phenolic acids, and terpenes. The essential oil and extracts of 
  <italic>T. mastichina</italic> have demonstrated a wide diversity of biological activities. They showed antibacterial activity against several bacteria such as 
  <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
  <italic>Proteus mirabilis</italic>, 
  <italic>Salmonella</italic> subsp., methicillin-resistant and methicillin-sensitive 
  <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
  <italic>Listeria monocytogenes EGD</italic>, 
  <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic>, and 
  <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, among others, and antifungal activity against 
  <italic>Candida</italic> spp. and 
  <italic>Fusarium</italic> spp. Additionally, it has antioxidant activity, which has been evaluated through different methods. Furthermore, other activities have also been studied, such as anticancer, antiviral, insecticidal, repellent, anti-Alzheimer, and anti-inflammatory activity. In conclusion, considering the biological activities reported for the essential oil and extracts of 
  <italic>T. mastichina</italic>, its potential as a preservative agent could be explored to be used in the food, cosmetic, or pharmaceutical industries.
