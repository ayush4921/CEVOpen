0: Thymus mastichina has the appearance of a semishrub and can be found in jungles and rocky lands of the Iberian Peninsula.
1: This work aimed to review and gather available scientific information on the composition and biological properties of   T. mastichina.
2: The main constituents of   T. mastichina essential oil are 1,8-cineole (or eucalyptol) and linalool, while the extracts are characterized by the presence of flavonoids, phenolic acids, and terpenes.
3: The essential oil and extracts of   T. mastichina have demonstrated a wide diversity of biological activities.
4: They showed antibacterial activity against several bacteria such as   Escherichia coli,   Proteus mirabilis,   Salmonella subsp., methicillin-resistant and methicillin-sensitive   Staphylococcus aureus,   Listeria monocytogenes EGD,   Bacillus cereus, and   Pseudomonas, among others, and antifungal activity against   Candida spp.
5: and   Fusarium spp.
6: Additionally, it has antioxidant activity, which has been evaluated through different methods.
7: Furthermore, other activities have also been studied, such as anticancer, antiviral, insecticidal, repellent, anti-Alzheimer, and anti-inflammatory activity.
8: In conclusion, considering the biological activities reported for the essential oil and extracts of   T. mastichina, its potential as a preservative agent could be explored to be used in the food, cosmetic, or pharmaceutical industries.
