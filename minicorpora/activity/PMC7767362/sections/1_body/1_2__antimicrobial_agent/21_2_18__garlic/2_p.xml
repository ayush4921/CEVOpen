<p>Numerous researchers have demonstrated the antioxidant property of garlic which is due to the presence of some chemical components including organosulfur, and phenolic compounds [

 <xref rid="B302-antioxidants-09-01309" ref-type="bibr">302</xref>]. Garlic has a high content of phenolic compounds which are the reason for the high antioxidant activities of garlic [
 <xref rid="B303-antioxidants-09-01309" ref-type="bibr">303</xref>]. Some researchers have indicated that the extract of garlic shows high scavenging of free radicals and therefore has powerful antioxidant ability [

 <xref rid="B305-antioxidants-09-01309" ref-type="bibr">305</xref>]. Furthermore, other studies have reported that garlic shows antioxidant ability including one research which analyzed this ability using in vivo experiments [

 <xref rid="B306-antioxidants-09-01309" ref-type="bibr">306</xref>]. Amino acids such as alliin represent one of the important components of garlic [
 <xref rid="B307-antioxidants-09-01309" ref-type="bibr">307</xref>]. The alliinase enzyme can convert alliin to allicin which is one of the main components of garlic. This chemical compound is responsible for the antimicrobial activity of this herbal medicine [
