<p>Portulaca is one of the traditional herbs from Asia. It has been reported to have potent antimicrobial and antioxidant activity. Several researchers have declared the biomedicine activities of portulaca over the past decades. The antioxidant effects of portulaca are the main factor of the biomedicine activity of this plant. Therefore, this plant can naturalize free radicals such as ROS in lipid chains. Hence, it can inhibit the further oxidation of lipids [
 <xref rid="B40-antioxidants-09-01309" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The antioxidant and antimicrobial property of portulaca is related to its components such as ascorbic acid, a-tocopherols, omega-3 fatty acids, apigenin, gallotannins, quercetin, and kaempferol. The antioxidant activity of portulaca is primarily related to omega-3 fatty acids [

 <italic>E. coli (Escherichia coli)</italic>, 
 <italic>Streptococcus faecalis</italic>,

 <xref rid="B87-antioxidants-09-01309" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Researchers in the last decade have found that portulacaâ€™s extracts demonstrate inhibitory ability against different bacteria (Gram-negative and Gram-positive). Other studies have reported the antifungal activity of portulaca extracts against various fungi using an automatic single-cell bioassay system. The antifungal activity of the portulaca was also revealed against fungi such as 
 <italic>Aspergillus yeast Candida</italic> and 
 <italic>Trichophyton</italic>. The ethylacetate extract of portulaca shows positive activity against dermatophytes of the genera 
 <italic>Trichophyton</italic> [

 <italic>Fusarium</italic>, 
 <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic>, and 
 <italic>Rhizopus artocarpi</italic> [
 <xref rid="B90-antioxidants-09-01309" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. The antioxidant and antimicrobial activity of this medicinal plant is based on its chemical content including phenolic compounds [
