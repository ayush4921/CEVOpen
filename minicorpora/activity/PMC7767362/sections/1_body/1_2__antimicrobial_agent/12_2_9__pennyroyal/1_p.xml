 <xref rid="B197-antioxidants-09-01309" ref-type="bibr">197</xref>]. Phenols are the most bioactive component of the extracts and essential oil of pennyroyal. This organic compound has been shown to contain an OH functional group that is bound directly to the aromatic ring, and the hydrogen atom of the OH functional group can snare peroxyl radicals. Therefore, it can prevent the oxidation of other compounds [

 <xref rid="B199-antioxidants-09-01309" ref-type="bibr">199</xref>]. Some researchers have studied the relationship between concentrations of the extract and essential oil of pennyroyal and their antioxidant activity. These results have shown a direct relation between the antioxidant activity and phenol content. The essential oil of this plant has also been shown to possess high antibacterial activity [
 <xref rid="B200-antioxidants-09-01309" ref-type="bibr">200</xref>]. The antimicrobial ability of this plant is related to the presence of neo-menthol, pulegone, and menthone. Most studies have shown a strong antimicrobial ability of pennyroyal against different bacteria including 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>S. typhimurim</italic>, 
 <italic>Yersinia enterocolitica</italic>, 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic>,

 <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic>, 
 <italic>Brochothrix thermosphacta</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, and 
 <italic>Klebsiella</italic>. The extract and essential oils of this plant pass through the cell wall of bacteria by damaging the membrane. This then results in disruption of the structure of polysaccharides, fatty acids, and phospholipids layers by an oxidation reaction [
