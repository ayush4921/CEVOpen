 <xref rid="B270-antioxidants-09-01309" ref-type="bibr">270</xref>]. Primrose contains some alcohols, sterols, hydrocarbons, and tocopherols [
 <xref rid="B65-antioxidants-09-01309" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Sterols have been used for their antitumor properties and their cholesterol-lowering effects. Phytosterols present in primrose have also been shown to have antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory abilities [
 <xref rid="B65-antioxidants-09-01309" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Previous studies have demonstrated the high antimicrobial ability of the extracts and essential oil of primrose against different microorganisms such as 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> [
