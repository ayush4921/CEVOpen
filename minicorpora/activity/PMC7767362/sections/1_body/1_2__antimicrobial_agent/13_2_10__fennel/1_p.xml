<p>Fennel (
 <italic>Foeniculum vulgare</italic>) is one of the herbal medicinal plants belonging to the 
 <italic>Apiaceae</italic> family. Its native habitats include shores of Mediterranean Sea. There are some studies on the radical scavenging activity of fennel [
 <xref rid="B203-antioxidants-09-01309" ref-type="bibr">203</xref>]. These studies have revealed that the antioxidant ability of this plant is due to the presence of high phenolic content in its extracts. Fennel has been shown to have high antioxidant ability. The antioxidant ability of the extract of this plant is due to numerous antioxidant processes such as free radical scavenging, superoxide anion radical scavenging, total antioxidant, and hydrogen peroxide scavenging [

 <xref rid="B205-antioxidants-09-01309" ref-type="bibr">205</xref>]. The strong antioxidant characteristics of ethanol extracts and essential oil of this plant have been demonstrated by in vitro studies [
 <xref rid="B206-antioxidants-09-01309" ref-type="bibr">206</xref>]. The hydro-ethanolic extracts of this plant have shown to possess free radical scavenging characteristics directly proportional to the content of phenolic compounds of fennel extract. The extracts and essential oil of this plant have been demonstrated to have significant antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory properties [
 <xref rid="B56-antioxidants-09-01309" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The antimicrobial property of the essential oil (EO) and extract of fennel has been proven using the disk diffusion method [
 <xref rid="B207-antioxidants-09-01309" ref-type="bibr">207</xref>]. Fennel extracts and essential oils have demonstrated high inhibitory activity against 
 <italic>Bacillus megaterium, Eschericha coli, Bacillus pumilus, S. aureus, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas syringae, Salmonella typhi, Bacillus cereus, Micrococcus luteus, Klebsiella pneumonia</italic> and 
 <italic>Bacillus subtili</italic> [

 <xref rid="B208-antioxidants-09-01309" ref-type="bibr">208</xref>]. The inhibitory ability of fennel also depends on its dosage. Consequently, fennel extract and oils could be a biosource of medicinal materials needed for the manufacturing of novel antimicrobial agents [
 <xref rid="B209-antioxidants-09-01309" ref-type="bibr">209</xref>]. Fennel has been shown to be inhibitory against influenza A virus [
