<p>Most of the data regarding the medical and scientific uses given to mints throughout history are vastly scattered and/or incomplete. The aim of this paper was to provide an extensive descriptive overview of the medical uses given to these herbs, highlighting both the authors in medical culture responsible for their dissemination, as well as their major galenic formulations. The next section references these authors and respective written sources in chronological order (

 <xref rid="biology-09-00484-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). A comprehensive review of the composition of the mint herbs and a correlation with their ancient/actual medical properties is beyond the scope of this paper. Databases on medical science (Pubmed, Springer Link, Google Scholar, Internet Archive, U.S. National Library of Medicine) were searched using combinations of the following keywords: “mentha”, “mint”, and its variations to include the several species’ names, “medical” and “history”. Reference textbooks on medical history, botanics (aromatic herbs), and pharmacognosy were also consulted. The literary works of the most relevant authors were accessed and analyzed as regarding the previous keywords. From the numerous medical/science research papers accessed, the most relevant ones for the historical discussion comprised in this paper were selected. Given that some authors of the many analyzed written sources do not clearly identify the mint species used, the term “mint” will be used throughout this paper with the meaning “unknown species”. Nevertheless, whenever possible, the names of the concerned species will be provided.
