<p>Most mints invariably grow in moist environments near ponds, lakes, and rivers and require partial shade, although some species grow well in warm environments [

 <italic>Theriaca</italic> by Nicander of Colophon (197 BC–170 BC), Greek poet and physician, alludes to their habitat and describes them as ‘delighting in gleaming rivers’ [

 <italic>Gargantua and Pantagruel</italic> [

The first attempt to classify them from a botanical perspective came from Pedanius Dioscorides (c. 40–90), the renowned Greek physician and herbalist, whose teachings became a reference from classical antiquity well into the Renaissance period. A more formal classification was proposed several centuries later by Carl Nilsson Linnæus (1707–1778) in his 
 <italic>Species Plantarum</italic> (The Species of Plants) published in 1753 [
 <xref rid="B7-biology-09-00484" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], which has been further perfected in recent years based on the genetic relations between these species [
 <xref rid="B8-biology-09-00484" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. To contribute to the complexity of the mint taxonomy, all the different species are referred to in many medical treatises as simply mint, which prevents a more precise appreciation of the uses given to each particular species. From a pharmacognosy perspective, the therapeutic value of herbs lies in aerial parts, which can be dried and ground into powder or used fresh. If used fresh, aerial parts can be subjected to water or steam distillation to produce an essential oil that is extracted [
