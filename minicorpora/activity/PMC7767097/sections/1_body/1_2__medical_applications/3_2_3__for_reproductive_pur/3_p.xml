<p>Regarding male health and fertility, several considerations regarding the possible effect of mints on sperm generation existed. Pliny wrote that adding watermint to milk prevented it from curdling and thickening or turning sour. Assuming that a similar effect would occur with semen, Pliny wrote that ingesting watermint could change the consistency of semen and, therefore, affect fertility [

 <xref rid="B40-biology-09-00484" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Thus, pennyroyal was a valued herb through the ages for female health, but, in the 20th century, its use has steadily declined mainly due to the creation of abortifacient drugs and to the increase in the awareness against this herb’s toxicity profile, with only scarce records of its use being found today.
