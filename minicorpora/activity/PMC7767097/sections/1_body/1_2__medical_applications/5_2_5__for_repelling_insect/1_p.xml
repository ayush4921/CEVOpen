<p>Providing protection against the different elements of the natural world, including animals, was always a concern for human beings, and mints have been employed as insect repellants and adjuncts in animal bite treatments since ancient times. By quoting Xenocrates (396 BC–314 BC), Pliny advised smelling pennyroyal and placing it near patients with tertian fevers (probably referring to malaria) that were prevalent in Hellenistic Greece and Egypt [

 <italic>Tyriaca diatesereon</italic> and Saint Paul’s potion for patients with quartan fever (once again, probably malaria) [

 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> protozoa from spreading, the causative agents of malaria from mosquito bites based on herbs’ insect repellant activity. Paulus Aegineta noted that spreading herbs, including pennyroyal, was useful for repelling reptiles [
 <xref rid="B31-biology-09-00484" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. It has already been established that 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> herbs, especially pennyroyal, have repellant, larvicidal and growth/reproduction regulatory activities against a wide variety of insects, including the mosquitoes responsible for spreading malaria (
 <italic>Anopheles sp.</italic>), yellow fever, dengue (
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>), and zika (
 <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic>) [
