<p>For the purpose of dealing with animal bites, several records are noteworthy. Nicander of Colophon used mints to create a ‘repellant stench’ to chase off snakes [
 <xref rid="B5-biology-09-00484" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], while Pliny wrote of watermint and pennyroyal’s usefulness for snake, scolopendra, and scorpion bites [
 <xref rid="B17-biology-09-00484" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Trota also suggests people drinking 
 <italic>Tyriaca diatesereon</italic> who had been bitten by poisonous animals and rabid dogs, as well as applying it to the wound itself. She also advised using 
 <italic>Tyriaca magna Galeni</italic> with added mint water to help with poisoned wounds [
 <xref rid="B40-biology-09-00484" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. It is noteworthy that later references to mints are lacking, and recent scientific publications that have addressed the usefulness of mint-derived products to counteract animal venoms are scarce and inconclusive [
