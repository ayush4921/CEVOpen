<p id="p0130">According to studies conducted in different regions of Turkey (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), the most common genera are 
 <italic>Sideritis</italic> (16 taxa, 7.1%), 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> (12 taxa, 5.4%), 
 <italic>Thymus</italic> (12 taxa, 5.4%), and 
 <italic>Origanum</italic> (10 taxa, 4.5%). This finding may indicate that these genus members are more effective in anti-influenza treatment than other genera. In addition, they are the most favored medicinal tea for the locals of Turkey, and even without natural nationwide distribution, it is possible to find these products in almost every public market, herbal and spice shop (

 <italic>Melissa officinalis</italic>), lavender (
 <italic>Lavandula angustifolia</italic>), cassidony (
 <italic>Lavandula stoechas</italic>) and sage (
 <italic>Salvia officinalis</italic>), are today being grown in home gardens, balconies or on small farms by rural people for folk medicine use, or for trade and household income (

 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Ekşi et al., 2020</xref>). like thyme, melissa, lavender, and sage, Among the identified plants, 145 were wild (64.7%), 49 were wild and cultivated (21.9%), 27 were endemic (12.1%) and 3 (
 <italic>Allium cepa, Allium sativa</italic> and 
 <italic>Malus domestica</italic>) were cultivated (1.3%). These parameters are shown in a column in 
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>; wild taxa as “W", cultivated “C", cultivated &amp; wild “CW” and endemic “E". Most of the plant pieces used are aerial parts (41.1%), flowers/flowering branches/petals (30.8%), leaves (25.0%), fruits (17.4%), seeds/cones (8.5%), roots/bulbs/tubers (6.7%), and other parts (stems, buds, barks, whole parts, resins, tars, cupula, bracts, fruit stalks, essential oils and fixed oils) (14.3%). Those parts were mostly used as infusions (78.6%), decoction/boiling (19.2%), raw eating/swallowing/salad (12.9%), molasses/jam/syrup/juice (7.6%), lotion/drop/cataplasm/vapor compression (6.3%) and other consumption types (roasting, mouthwash, tincture, mixture and pastes) (5.4%) and powdered for spice use (3.1%). The taxa having with the most usage types are 
 <italic>Citrus</italic> spp (7 types, 3.1%), 
 <italic>Rosa canina</italic> and 
 <italic>Rubus sanctus</italic> (5 types, 2.2%) and 
 <italic>Vitis vinifera</italic> (4 types, 1.8%), while the taxa with the maximum number of consumption parts belong to 
 <italic>Rosa canina</italic> and 
 <italic>Tilia tomentosa</italic> (6 parts, 2.7%), and 
 <italic>Juniperus oxycedrus</italic> (5 parts, 2.2%). Additionally, 
 <italic>Rosa canina</italic> (with 5 different types of use and 6 different parts) have appeared as the most efficient plants in terms of the total of both part and usage type (
