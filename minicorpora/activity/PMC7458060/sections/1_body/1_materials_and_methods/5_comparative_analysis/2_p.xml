<p id="p0110">After obtaining the total list of plants with anti-influenza potential in Turkish folk medicine, a comparison was made to determine the similarity percentages in similar studies conducted in neighboring and nearby countries (
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> ). To avoid distraction from the subject integrity, not all studies in those countries were included in our comparison. Therefore, only the study with the richest content and the highest percentage of similarity from each country was included in the comparison list. Studies with a similarity percentage &gt;10% were eliminated in the primary elections.
