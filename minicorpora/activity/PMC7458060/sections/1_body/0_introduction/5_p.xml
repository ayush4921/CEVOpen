<p id="p0025">Empirical information and bio experiments based on the ethnomedical benefits of plants show that they have the potential to identify new antivirals that can be used against influenza. In particular, the results of research on plant-based antiviral activity and active ingredients against influenza viruses using purified plant chemicals are promising (
