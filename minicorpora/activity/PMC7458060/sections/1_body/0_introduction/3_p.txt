0: In virus classification, influenza viruses are RNA viruses that comprise 4 of the 7 genera of the family Orthomyxoviridae ( Kawaoka, 2006), while Human Rhinoviruses (HRVs) are within the genus Enterovirus and the family Picornaviridae ( Jacobs et al., 2013).
1: Nevertheless, the flu caused by influenza viruses and the common cold caused by Human Rhinovirus are very similar, although both are types of respiratory virus in terms of disease symptoms ( CDC, 2019).
2: In general, it is the most common cause of respiratory viral disease in spring, summer and autumn, while the flu virus is dominant in winter.
3: On the other hand, flu or flu-like viruses are highly contagious and cause serious complications and outbreaks that erupt with a different genetic code each year and even life-threatening pandemics ( Jacobs et al., 2013).
4: Nowadays, COVID-19 is one of the most striking examples of a flu-like virus.
5: Due to its fast transmission through direct contact with infected people and contaminated substances or droplets, thousands of patients are dying every day with a fever, cough, and shortness of breath, and, currently, there is no definitive treatment or vaccine, except for some available malaria medicines ( Basiri, 2020).
6: There is an urgent need to identify new naturally occurring antiviral molecules, as resistance to anti-influenza drugs appears to be prevalent to an alarming extent ( Haidari et al., 2009).
7: Herbal remedies have been used for centuries to treat flu symptoms, and essential oils derived from them have been prescribed as complementary and alternative treatments against influenza ( Setzer, 2016).
8: Therefore, to contribute to the treatment of influenza disease and bearing in mind their greater importance, we focused on plants whose successful anti-influenza effects have been tried and trusted by Turkish people for centuries.
