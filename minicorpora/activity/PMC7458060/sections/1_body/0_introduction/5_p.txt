0: Empirical information and bio experiments based on the ethnomedical benefits of plants show that they have the potential to identify new antivirals that can be used against influenza.
1: In particular, the results of research on plant-based antiviral activity and active ingredients against influenza viruses using purified plant chemicals are promising ( Grienke et al., 2012).
2: Some of them include determination of the antiviral and cytotoxic effect of quercetin 3-glucoside (Q3G) from  Dianthus superbus on influenza virus infection and replication by  Nile et al.
3: (2020), revealing the neuraminidase inhibitory effect (on the Influenza Virus replication) of agathisflavone derived from the  Anacardium occidentale by  De Freitas et al.
4: (2020), and discovering the inhibitory effect of pomegranate ( Punica granatum L.) peel extract polymerase activity, RNA replication, and protein expression of the influenza virus by  Moradi et al.
5: (2020).
