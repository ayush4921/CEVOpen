 <caption> The expression level of genes producing IFN-γ and IL12 cytokines in mice treated with MCEO. The results demonstrated that although the mRNA levels of IFN-γ and IL-12 were elevated in all mice of experimental groups, a significant increase ( p &lt; 0.001) was observed in tested groups of Ex2 (200 mg/kg) and Ex3 (300 mg/kg), when compared with control groups. * p &lt; 0.05. </caption>
