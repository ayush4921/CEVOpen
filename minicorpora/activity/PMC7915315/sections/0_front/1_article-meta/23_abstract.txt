0: Background:   Myrtus communis (  M. communis) is a wild aromatic plant used for traditional herbal medicine that can be demonstrated in insecticidal, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial activity of its essential oils (MCEO).
1: Aim: The present study aimed to evaluate the prophylactic effects of   M. communis essential oil (MCEO) against chronic toxoplasmosis induced by the Tehran strain of   Toxoplasma gondii in mice.
2: Methods: Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis was performed to determine the chemical composition of MCEO.
3: Mice were then orally administrated with MCEO at the doses of 100, 200, and 300 mg/kg/day and also atovaquone 100 mg/kg for 21 days.
4: On the 15th day, the mice were infected with the intraperitoneal inoculation of 2025 tissue cysts from the Tehran strain of   T. gondii.
5: The mean numbers of brain tissue cysts and the mRNA levels of IL-12 and IFN- in mice of each tested group were measured.
6: Results: By GC/MS, the major constituents were -pinene (24.7%), 1,8-cineole (19.6%), and linalool (12.6%), respectively.
7: The results demonstrated that the mean number of   T. gondii tissue cysts in experimental groups Ex1 (  p< 0.05), Ex2 (  p< 0.001) and Ex3 (  p< 0.001) was meaningfully reduced in a dose-dependent manner compared with the control group (C2).
8: The mean diameter of tissue cyst was significantly reduced in mice of the experimental groups Ex2 (  p< 0.01) and Ex3 (  p< 0.001).
9: The results demonstrated that although the mRNA levels of IFN- and IL-12 were elevated in all mice of experimental groups, a significant increase (  p< 0.001) was observed in tested groups of Ex2 and Ex3 when compared with control groups.
10: Conclusion: The findings of the present study demonstrated the potent prophylactic effects of MCEO especially in the doses 200 and 300 mg/kg in mice infected with   T. gondii.
11: Although the exceptional anti-  Toxoplasma effects of MCEO and other possessions, such as improved innate immunity and low toxicity are positive topics, there is, however, a need for more proof from investigations in this field.
