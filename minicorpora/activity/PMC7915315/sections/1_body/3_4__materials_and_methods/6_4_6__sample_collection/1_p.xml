<p>To collect the brain samples, mice in each group were deeply anesthetized by means of intraperitoneal administration of ketamine (150 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg). In the next step followed by decapitation, total brain tissues from each mouse were aseptically collected. To evaluate the parasitological changes, we applied the right hemisphere; while another hemisphere was maintained in −80 °C to determine the molecular examinations.</p>
