<p>Although the chemical composition of MCEO was studied in different studies around the world [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-26-00819" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], it has been proven that the chemical composition of essential oils is somewhat variable depending on some factors such as the plant collection place, part of used, the time of harvest, and the method of extraction [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-26-00819" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Based on the previous studies, terpenoid compounds such as 1,8-cineole, α-pinene, limonene, linalool, α-terpinolene, etc., are considered as the main components found in 
 <italic>M. communis</italic> essential oil [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-26-00819" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The results of our study in agreement with previous studies show that the major constituents of MCEO were 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene (24.7%), 1,8-cineole (19.6%), and linalool (12.6%), respectively [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-26-00819" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Reviews have demonstrated that the antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, and anti-parasitic activities of terpenes, terpenoides, and their derivatives against a wide range of pathogenic strains [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-26-00819" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. It this indicated that these phytoconstituents could be responsible for their antimicrobial activity while their precise mechanism of action is not clearly understood. Previous studies have demonstrated that these compounds showed antimicrobial effects through the disruption of cell membrane, inhibition of oxygen consumption, inhibition of virulence factors, etc. [
