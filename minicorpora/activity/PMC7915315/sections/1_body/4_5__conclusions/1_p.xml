<p>The findings of the present study demonstrated the exceptional anti-
 <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> effects of MCEO in infected mice with 
 <italic>T. gondii</italic>. Thus, oral administration of MCEO in the doses of 200 and 300 mg/kg for 21 days was able to prevent severe symptoms of the toxoplasmosis in the mouse model. However, the exceptional anti-
 <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> effects of MCEO and other effects, such as improved innate immunity and low toxicity, are positive topics that need more proof from investigations in this field.
