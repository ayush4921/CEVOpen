<p>Hydrocarbons (17.37%) represented remarkable constituents of the 
 <italic>A. ochroleuca</italic> EO, including oxygenated (16.81%) and non-oxygenated compounds (0.56%) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00998-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Among all identified hydrocarbons, 16 oxygenated compounds were characterized, with abundance of oleic acid, methyl ester (7.37%), and gamolenic acid (2.58%), while ethyl oleate (0.14%) was detected as minor compound. Additionally, only two compounds (2-

 <italic>n</italic>-hexadecane) were identified as non-oxygenated hydrocarbons. The carotenoids, including dihydroedulan II and 
 <italic>trans</italic>-
 <italic>Î±</italic>-ionone, were characterized in the EO of 
 <italic>A. ochroleuca</italic> with a concentration of 0.49% and 0.24%, respectively. It is pertinent to mention here that carotenoids (tetraterpenoids) are reported as abundant pigments in numerous EOs derived from wild plants, vegetables, and fruits [
