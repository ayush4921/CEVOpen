<p>The EOs were extracted by hydrodistillation from two samples of 
 <italic>A. ochroleuca</italic> above-ground parts via a Clevenger-type apparatus for three hours. The oil layer was collected, and water was removed by 0.5 g of anhydrous Na
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>; they were stored in a dark glass vial at 4 °C till further analysis. The yields of the extracted EOs were calculated via the equation 100× (
 <italic>V</italic>/
 <italic>W</italic>), where 
 <italic>V</italic>: volume of extracted EO, and 
 <italic>W</italic>: weight of the plant material used in extraction. The chemical composition of the EO samples was analyzed and identified separately by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) as described in our previously documented work [
