<p>In brief, GC-MS analysis was carried out at the Department of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants Research, National Research Center, Giza, Egypt, using the GC-MS instrument which has TRACE GC Ultra Gas Chromatographs (THERMO Scientific™. Corporate, Waltham, MA, USA) and Thermo Scientific ISQ™ EC single quadrupole mass spectrometer. The GC-MS system is equipped with a TR-5 MS column with dimensions of 30 m × 0.32 mm i.d., 0.25 µm film thickness. At flow rate of 1.0 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup>, helium was used as carrier gas with split ratio of 1:10. The temperature program was 60 °C for 1 min, rising by 4.0 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup> to 240 °C and held for 1 min. A diluted sample in hexane (1 µL) at a ratio of 1:10 (

 <italic>v</italic>) was injected, and the injector and detector were held at 210 °C. Mass spectra were recorded by electron ionization (EI) at 70 eV, using a spectral range of 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 40–450. The identification of the chemical constituents of the EOs was achieved using Automated Mass spectral Deconvolution and Identification (AMDIS) software, Wiley spectral library collection, NIST library database, retention indices relative to 
 <italic>n</italic>-alkanes (C
