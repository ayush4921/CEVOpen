0: Mentha species are widely used as food, medicine, spices, and flavoring agents.
1: Thus, chemical composition is an important parameter for assessing the quality of mints.
2: In general, the contents of menthol, menthone, eucalyptol, and limonene comprise one of the major parameters for assessing the quality of commercially important mints.
3: Building further on the phytochemical characterization of the quality of   Mentha species, this work was focused on the composition of phenolic compounds in methanolic extracts.
4: Thirteen   Mentha species were grown under the same environmental conditions, and their methanolic extracts were subjected to the LCMS/MS (liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry) profiling of phenolics and the testing their biological activities, i.e., antioxidant and tyrosinase inhibition activities, which are important features for the cosmetic industry.
5: The total phenolic content (TPC) ranged from 14.81  1.09 mg GAE (gallic acid equivalents)/g for   Mentha cervina to 58.93.
6: 8.39 mg GAE/g for   Mentha suaveolens.
7: The antioxidant activity of examined   Mentha related with the content of the phenolic compounds and ranged from 22.79  1.85 to 106.04  3.26 mg TE (Trolox equivalents)/g for   M. cervina and   Mentha x villosa, respectively.
8: Additionally,   Mentha pulegium (123.89  5.64 mg KAE (kojic acid equivalents)/g) and   Mentha x piperita (102.82  15.16 mg KAE/g) showed a strong inhibition of the enzyme tyrosinase, which is related to skin hyperpigmentation.
9: The most abundant compound in all samples was rosmarinic acid, ranging from 1363.38  8323 to 2557.08  64.21 g/g.
10: In general, the levels of phenolic acids in all examined mint extracts did not significantly differ.
11: On the contrary, the levels of flavonoids varied within the species, especially in the case of hesperidin (from 0.73  0.02 to 109.
12: 39  2.01 g/g), luteolin (from 1.84  0.11 to 31.03  0.16 g/g), and kaempferol (from 1.30  0.17 to 33.68  0.81 g/g).
13: Overall results indicated that all examined mints possess significant amounts of phenolic compounds that are responsible for antioxidant activity and, to some extent, for tyrosinase inhibition activity.
14: Phenolics also proved to be adequate compounds, together with terpenoids, for the characterization of   Mentha sp.
15: Additionally, citrus-scented   Mentha x   villosa could be selected as a good candidate for the food and pharmaceutical industry, especially due its chemical composition and easy cultivation, even in winter continental conditions.
