0: AbstractToxoplasma gondii is a zoonotic parasite of worldwide importance, responsible for toxoplasmosis in homeotherms.
1: Although treatment options are readily available, most drugs often cause serious side effects.
2: Extracts of   Dracocephalum kotschyi (  D. kotschyi) have shown significant pharmacological activity against various parasites, viruses, and bacteria.
3: In this study, we evaluated the anti  T. gondii activity in vitro and in vivo of   D. kotschyi essential oil.
4: The thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT) method was used to assess the anti  T. gondii activity and cytotoxicity of the essential oil.
5: The presence of   T. gondii was observed by Giemsa staining, and the viability was evaluated by the trypan blue staining method.
6: Furthermore, the survival rate of acutely infected mice was evaluated by intraperitoneal injecting of the essential oil (50, 100, and 200 mg kg  1 day  1) for five days after infection with 2  10  4 tachyzoites.
7: Essential oil, negative, and positive controls that showed the best toxoplasmacidal activity were assayed in triplicate at each concentration.
8: The essential oil exhibited the highest anti  Toxoplasma activity with a halfmaximal inhibitory concentration (IC  50) of 9.94  0.38 g, with a selectivity index of 2.463.
9: On Vero cells, the CC  50 of the oil was 24.49  0.96 g and exhibited a significant anti  Toxoplasma activity.
10: Moreover, the treatment by essential oil significantly increased the survival rate compared to untreated infected control.
11: In conclusion, the essential oil might be a useful compound, and with more testing, it may be an excellent alternative to standard chemical drugs in the treatment of toxoplasmosis.
