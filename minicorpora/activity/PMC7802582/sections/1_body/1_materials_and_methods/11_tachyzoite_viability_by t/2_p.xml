<p>Tachyzoite viability test was permed, in vitro using the method proposed by Cover and Gutteridge (Cover &amp; Gutteridge, 
 <xref rid="fsn32021-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">1982</xref>). 45 μl of tachyzoite suspension containing 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/ml and 
 <italic>D. kotschyi</italic> essential oil at six different concentrations (1, 10, 50, 100, 500, and 1000µg) in 96‐well microplates are brought together. The whole is incubated at 37°C. After 30, 90, and 180 min incubation in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> at 37°C, a trypan blue dye exclusion test for tachyzoites is carried out under an inverted microscope. Results were expressed as % viability. Positive controls consisted of 96‐well plates containing pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine at a concentration of 100 mg/ml, while PBS were the negative controls. The plates were then spread on a glass slide followed by an examination under an optical microscope. The experiments were repeated three times.
