<p>The cytotoxicity of the essential oil was evaluated on Vero cells with a modification of the MTT test (Sigma‐Aldrich, USA) with 3‐(4, 5‐dimethylthiazol‐2‐yl)‐2,5‐diphenyltetrazolium bromide, described by Mosmann (Mosmann, 
 <xref rid="fsn32021-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">1983</xref>), using 96‐well plates. 6 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/mL of Vero cells were inoculated into each well previously containing 100μL growth medium. Incubation at 37ºC followed in an incubator moistened with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 24 hr. After this incubation, the Vero cells were treated with extracts of 
 <italic>D. kotschyi</italic> at different concentrations: 1,000, 500, 100, 50, 10, and 1 μg. Each concentration was added to each respective 96‐well plate. Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine (reference drugs used in the treatment of toxoplasmosis) were used as positive controls while RPMI‐1640 was used as a control buffer. After 24 hr, the supernatant was removed. 100 μl of the MTT‐PBS solution (5 mg/ml) in RPMI‐1640 in a 1:9 ratios in each well. The plate was then covered with aluminum foil and incubated for 4 hr in a 37º C incubator. The medium was then discarded, and 100 μl of DMSO was added to each well to solubilize the dark blue MTT formazan salt. The optical density was measured at an absorbance of 570 nm using a Dynex microplate reader.
