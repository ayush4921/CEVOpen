<p>An Agilent 7890A GC coupled with an Agilent 5975C mass detector with triple quadrupole mass analyzer and electronic ionization (EI) was used for the GC analysis of the essential oil. The gas chromatograph was prepared with an HP‐5 GC capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm; film thickness 0.25 μm). The oven temperature was started from 50 ºC, held for 2 min, raised by 8ºC/min up to 250°C, followed by 250–330°C by 3ºC/min with the total run time of 58 min. The carrier gas was helium was at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. The temperature used for the injector and the detector is 280°C. The parameters for MS were as follows: ion source temperature (230°C), mass range (50–700), ionization voltage (70 Ev). The MSD ChemStation was used as operating software. A comparison of mass spectra and retention times with literature data helped to identify compounds (Javidnia et al.,
