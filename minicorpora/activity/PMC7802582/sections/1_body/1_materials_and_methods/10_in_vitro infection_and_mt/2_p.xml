<p>Vero cells were used for this step. The cells were obtained by exponential growth. 3 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> parasites/ml was deposited in each well to have a final volume of 200 µl (Belloni et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32021-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>). The infected cells were then washed with RPMI‐1640 FBS‐free medium (twice), six hours after inoculation, to remove extracellular parasites. After incubation for 18 hr, 100 μl of RPMI‐1640 medium with 2% FBS were added to each well with different concentrations of essential oil/pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine (to a final concentration of 1‐1000μg) (Sheng‐Xia et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32021-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). The treatment lasted 24 hr, the anti‐
 <italic>T. gondii</italic> activity and the cytotoxicity of the essential oil were determined by a thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT) method in 96‐well plates (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). The essential oil was added to the cell line. After 24 hr, the MTT solution was added to the cells, and the presence of purple matrices was analyzed using a plate reader. All data points represent the average of three independent experiments. The mean inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) was determined based on the concentration of extracts, controls, and essential oil that successfully inhibited 50% of the 
 <italic>T. gondii</italic> tachyzoites. Selectivity is the mean IC
 <sub>50</sub> value for Vero cells relative to the mean IC
 <sub>50</sub> value for 
 <italic>T. gondii</italic> (Park et al.,
