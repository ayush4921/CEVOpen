<p>Our results further suggest that essential oil treatment may also induce dose‐dependent decreases in the ATP levels in 
 <italic>T. gondii</italic>. This suggests that the mechanism of action of the essential oil against 
 <italic>T. gondii</italic> could involve interference with the mitochondrial function of the parasite (Zhou et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32021-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). Besides, 
 <italic>T. gondii</italic> tachyzoites have only one mitochondrion, unlike mammalian cells (Melo et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32021-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>); therefore, mitochondrial damage can disrupt energy metabolism by inhibiting the supply of energy in 
 <italic>T. gondii</italic> tachyzoites, leading to their death. Confirming this, anti‐
 <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, under a microscope, the number of tachyzoites showed a sharp decrease from 1μg to 1,000 µg compared to control. However, the specific mechanism of action needs to be further investigated.
