<p>The treatment of toxoplasmosis involves anti‐parasitic drugs that act primarily against the tachyzoite form; they do not eradicate the encysted (bradyzoite) stage. The most effective agent is the pyrimethamine, which is used in most drug regimens (Dunay et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32021-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). However, leucovorin must be given concomitantly to prevent bone marrow suppression. The efficacy of trimethoprim, azithromycin, dapsone, clarithromycin, contrimaxole, atovaquone, and sulfamethoxazole is unclear; therefore, it is recommended that they are used only in combination with pyrimethamine (Dunay et al.,

 <xref rid="fsn32021-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). Of the available combinations, the most effective include pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine or trisulfapyrimidines. However, these combinations have many side effects that hamper their use. Hypersensitivity reactions, megaloblastic anemia, bone marrow damage, and agranulocytosis are inevitable in many cases (De La Torre et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32021-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Guaraldo et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32021-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). Therefore, it is necessary to find new, less toxic drugs for the treatment of this infection.
