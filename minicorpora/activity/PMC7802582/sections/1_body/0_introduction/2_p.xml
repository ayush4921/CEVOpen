 <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> is a protozoan that causes zoonosis in most homeothermic animals (Khamesipour et al.,

 <xref rid="fsn32021-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). The leading cause of infection due to the consumption of water or food contaminated by oocysts of the parasite, excreted by cats. Also, undercooked consumption containing tissue cysts can lead to transmission to humans. Primary infection is usually sub‐clinical. However, in the most severe cases, the manifestations may be eye disease or cervical lymphadenopathy. Maternal infection may also occur during pregnancy. The consequences can be severe for the fetus (Dunay et al.,
