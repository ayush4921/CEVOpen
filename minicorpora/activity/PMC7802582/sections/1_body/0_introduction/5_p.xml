<p>Although several scientific works have demonstrated the potential medicinal effect of 
 <italic>D. Kotschyi</italic> essential oil on several pathogens, few data are available about its anti‐parasitic activity. Some flavonoid isolated from 
 <italic>D. Kotschyi</italic> essential oil had trypanocidal properties on 
 <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> epimastigotes (Gohari et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32021-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>), but there is, to our knowledge, no data relating to the anti‐Toxoplasma properties of the plant. Given the therapeutic failure and severe side effects of the synthetic drugs available against many pathogens, safer therapeutic options must be explored. Incidentally, the use of essential oils to control parasitic pathogens could be useful in the fight against various infectious diseases. Here, we studied the activity of 
 <italic>D. Kotschyi</italic> essential oil against 
 <italic>T. gondii</italic> tachyzoites.
