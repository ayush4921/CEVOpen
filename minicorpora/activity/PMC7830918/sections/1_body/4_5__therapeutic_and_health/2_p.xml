<p>So far, about 500 research articles have been published on the presence, structure, chemical synthesis, and therapeutic properties of mangiferin. The majority of these studies are from India and Bangladesh. Countries like Brazil, Nigeria, and Iran also contributed significantly to reporting the therapeutic effects of mango contents. Mangiferin has been shown to restore the learning and memory impairments and to decrease hippocampal injury in a mouse model [
