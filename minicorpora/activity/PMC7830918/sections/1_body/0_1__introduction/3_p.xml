<p>Fruit plays an important role in the world’s economy and food security from various perspectives [

A recent study indicated that the frequency and severity of extreme weather events have affected mango production in Central Queensland, Australia [

The increasing temperatures are offering opportunities for mango production in new areas. The mangoes grown in the northern states of India and Thailand require longer to mature than those in the central and southern states [
