0: Fruit plays an important role in the worlds economy and food security from various perspectives [ 5].
1: However, economic success or failure of commercial mango production primarily relies on local weather and climate changes.
2: A recent study indicated that the frequency and severity of extreme weather events have affected mango production in Central Queensland, Australia [ 6].
3: Although mango trees are adapted to dry weather, weather factors like floods, rainfall, humidity, and temperature can influence tree growth, flowering, fruit growth, the color and size of fruit, and farmer income [ 6, 7, 8].
4: Temperature has a dominant influence on the appearance, quality, and taste of mango fruit.
5: The increasing temperatures are offering opportunities for mango production in new areas.
6: The mangoes grown in the northern states of India and Thailand require longer to mature than those in the central and southern states [ 7].
7: High temperature has positive effects on mango fruit growth and maturation.
8: The estimated duration of mango fruit development decreased by 1216 days in Australia due to the rise in winter temperature (1.5 C) over the last 45 years [ 9].
9: In addition, high-temperature-induced stress can trigger the synthesis of secondary metabolites, which are popular due to their nutritional and medicinal values [ 10].
