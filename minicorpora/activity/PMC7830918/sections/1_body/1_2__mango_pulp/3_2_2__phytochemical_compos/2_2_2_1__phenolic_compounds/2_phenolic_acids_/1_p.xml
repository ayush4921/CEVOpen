<p>Phenolic acids are the important secondary metabolites that help to protect against various diseases and play pivotal role in management of human health. Pulp contains mainly hydroxycinnamic- and hydroxybenzoic-derivative phenolic acids, which are present in free form or conjugated with glucose or quinic acid or both. Gallic, syringic, vanillic, and protocatechuic acids are the main constituents of the hydroxybenzoic acid group, and p-coumaric, ferulic, chlorogenic, and caffeic acids are the main constituents of the hydroxycinnamic acid group [

In the pulp of most mango varieties, the ferulic acid has the highest concentration (33.75 mg), followed by chlorogenic (0.96–6.20 mg), gallic (0.93–2.98 mg), vanillic (0.57–1.63 mg), protocatechuic (0.77 mg), and caffeic (0.25–0.10 mg) acids per 100 g of fresh fruit weight [
