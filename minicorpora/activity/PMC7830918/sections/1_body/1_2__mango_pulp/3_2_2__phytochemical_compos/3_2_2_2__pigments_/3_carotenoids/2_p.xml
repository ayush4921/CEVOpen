<p>The carotenoid content usually changes depending on the fruit maturity stage and the local environment. Ellong et al. [
 <xref rid="B27-ijerph-18-00741" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] reported four different varieties of carotenoids in the Bassignac variety, and the highest content (almost two-fold) was noted in fully ripened mango (4.138 mg/100 g) compared to unripe mango. According to the Nutrient Database of the USDA [
 <xref rid="B35-ijerph-18-00741" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], the Tommy Atkins mango contain 0.64 mg β-carotene, 0.009 mg α-carotene, 0.01 mg β-cryptoxanthin and lutein, and 0.023 mg zeaxanthin per 100 g. Manthey and Perkins-Veazie [
 <xref rid="B62-ijerph-18-00741" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] suggested that the variation in carotenoid content mainly depends on the type of cultivar, not on the location of production.
