 <p>One of the principal etiological agents associated with losses in horticultural crops is the fungus 
  <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> sp. This study aimed to evaluate the in vitro effectiveness of the essential oil (EO) from 
  <italic>Cymbopogon citratus</italic> in chitosan supports for the control of 
  <italic>Colletotrichum gloeosporioides</italic> isolated from sweet pepper plants. Methods: The extraction and phytochemical analysis of the EO of 
  <italic>C. citratus</italic> were performed along with its encapsulation in chitosan-agar in order to compare it with other techniques and determine its effect on 
  <italic>C. gloeosporioides</italic>. Results: The EO from the citral chemotype (58%) encapsulated in the chitosan-agar, with an 83% encapsulation efficiency in mass percentage, resulted in the total inhibition of mycelial growth at a minimum inhibitory concentration of 1370 ppm. This concentration was effective in controlling the disease under greenhouse conditions. The effectivity of the capsules containing EO was superior to that of other controls using EO evaluated in vitro. The capsules demonstrated an effective period of 51 days, with an additional 30 days of effectiveness after a reinfection cycle, thus providing similar results to the control with 
  <italic>Trichoderma</italic> sp. Conclusions: Chitosan capsules present a promising strategy in the use of 
  <italic>C. citratus</italic> EO on 
  <italic>C. gloeosporioides</italic>, and they are highly effective and stable under in vitro and field conditions
