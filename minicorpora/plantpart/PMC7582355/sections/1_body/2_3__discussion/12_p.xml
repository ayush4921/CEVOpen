<p>Greater use of EO in agriculture for the integrated management of fungal diseases caused by 
 <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> sp. in short-cycle vegetable crops could be made. This would allow fewer applications of fungicides since the stability of the capsules is greater than 40 days. Additionally, successive applications could be avoided since the reinfection process in the culture typically occurs within 30 days. These aspects make these capsules highly competitive against other unsustainable alternatives for the management of this phytopathogen. These advantages confirm the importance of linking new strategies to the integrated management of diseases in the fruit and vegetable sector of the dry Caribbean sub-region of Colombia. Regarding the use of EO, its potential as a phytopathogen controller has not yet been exploited in this sector [
