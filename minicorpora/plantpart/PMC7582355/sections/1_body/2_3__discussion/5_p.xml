 <italic>Cymbopogon</italic> oil to be more effective than carbendozim in pathogen control under in vitro conditions. Another study reported the application of chitosan as a crop management strategy to efficiently induce biotic and drought stress resistance in lentil plants in semi-arid regions [

On the other hand, the healthiness of bean plants grown in soil treated with chitosan and an increased quantity of microorganism colonies was significantly better compared to the control. The populations of antagonistic microorganisms formed in the soil in these treatments may have limited the growth of pathogenic fungus [

 <xref rid="B23-molecules-25-04447" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The chitosan used in this study did not show antifungal activity, which differed from the results obtained by Younes and Rinaudo [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-25-04447" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], who used chitosan to control fungi in several food categories. Other studies indicated that the molecular weight and the degree of deacetylation affect the biological activity of chitosan. The inhibition of phytopathogens is partial in both products with higher degrees of chitooligosaccharides deacetylation or low deacetylation-Water-soluble chitosan products at the highest evaluated concentrations [
