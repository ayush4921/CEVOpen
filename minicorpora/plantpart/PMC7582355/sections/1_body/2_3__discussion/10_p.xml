<p>The current study also noted that the chitosan-agar encapsulation optimizes the oil’s action and yield times, by presenting 100% effectiveness in the control of 
 <italic>C. gloeosporioides</italic> after the first five days of treatment. The other techniques evaluated showed an effectiveness of less than 90% MIC and failed to sustain their effect after 30 days. Additionally, it should be mentioned that EO differentially impacts fungal cells depending on the miscibility in the pathogen’s cell membrane. Here, it interacts with proteins, causing changes in hyphae and plasma membrane and causing alterations in their physicochemical properties (hydrophobicity, electrical conductivity, soluble protein filtration, and sugar reduction), which ultimately cause apoptosis [

 <italic>C. citratus</italic> over 
 <italic>C. gloesporioides</italic> is efficient regardless of the technique used as the literature refers to the control of mycelial growth equal to or greater than 80% [
