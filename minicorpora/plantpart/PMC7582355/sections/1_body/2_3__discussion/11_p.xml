<p>Chitosan capsules maintain their effectiveness due to the slow release of the encapsulated substance while also improving stability and solubility, which prevents the loss of EO [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-25-04447" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. This is the same reason why they are widely used in the food and pharmaceutical industry. This represents an economic benefit, making the use of the EO of 
 <italic>C. citratus</italic> for the control of phytopathogens in vegetables more economical than the use of conventional agrochemicals. This is especially the case as chitosan is an abundant byproduct obtained from the fishing industry [

 <italic>C. citratus</italic> and 
 <italic>Trichoderma</italic> sp. in integrated disease management systems was found to inhibit the growth of the antagonist by 100% seven days after inoculation using the poisoned food technique, as shown by Melo [

 <italic>Trichoderma</italic> sp. in sweet pepper plants should be done 60 days after the addition of the EO capsules to avoid the mentioned fungitoxic effect. A period of nine additional days will be necessary to limit the effect of volatile compounds resulting from the encapsulation of EO in chitosan. Another alternative for biological control in the dry Caribbean could be using pathogen control with chitosan-EO capsules of 
 <italic>C. citratus</italic> during the time of low rainfall and controlling with 
 <italic>Trichoderma</italic> in times of heavier rainfall. This compromise is beneficial since 
 <italic>Trichoderma</italic> sp. requires certain levels of environmental humidity to favor spore germination and biomass production.
