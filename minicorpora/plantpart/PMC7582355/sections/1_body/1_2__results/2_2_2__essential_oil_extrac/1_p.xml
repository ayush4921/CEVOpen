<p>The major components found in the 
 <italic>Cymbopogon citratus</italic> sample were Mircene (14.0%), Neral (22.1%), and Geranial (32.9%) (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04447-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The chemotype for this sample corresponds to Citral (55.0%) (Geranial + Neral) according to Alves [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-25-04447" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Some reports mention that the biocidal activity of the EO depends on the content of sesquiterpenes and monoterpenes, which vary according to the chemotype, crop conditions, and environmental conditions prior to harvest. Citral has been identified as one of the major components in both 
 <italic>Cymbopogon citratus</italic> (Poaceae) and 
 <italic>Lippia alba</italic> (Verbenaceae) and is part of the group of volatile components associated with biological activity along with myrcene, eugenol, and linalool [
