<p>During the tests for resistance against environmental conditions, there was no weight loss in capsules for the first 15 days, and they maintained their initial average weight of 0.07 Â± 0.007 g. Subsequently, after 30 days, there was a weight reduction of 50% with respect to initial size. After 45 days, the weight of the capsules was 10% of their initial weight (
