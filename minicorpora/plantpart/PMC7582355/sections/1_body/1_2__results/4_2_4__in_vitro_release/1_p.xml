<p>The in vitro EO release shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04447-f003">Figure 3</xref> represents the release profile of the optimized batch (in triplicate) of capsules, which were found to be almost identical to each other and exhibited the minimum burst effect. All the capsules (Chitosan-Agar-EO) have shown the continuous release of their content (9.7 Â± 1.02%) during the 120 h of the study period, with checks every 12 h. Following the trend line, the capsule would release 100% of the EO in 1233 h, which is equivalent to 51.4 days in conditions similar to those in vitro.
