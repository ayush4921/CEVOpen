<p>The preparation of the capsules resulted in the use of 33.32 g of EO, 36.75 g of chitosan, and 1.88 g of Agar to obtain 668 capsules with a total weight of 46.7 g. This indicates that the 3:1 ratio (Chitosan-Agar-EO) used as an encapsulant allowed the final content of the active ingredient in the capsule to be 71.21%. An increase in the polymer content of the formulation increases the retention capacity of the active ingredient.</p>
