<p>In order to assess whether chitosan alone had some antifungal activity, its activity on the pathogen was determined. According to the results obtained, no significant difference was identified between the chitosan treatment alone and the control treatment with agar-PDA following 24, 48, and 72 h of incubation. This indicates that this polymer matrix does not inhibit the growth of 
 <italic>C. gloeosporioides</italic> efficiently. A mycelium radius of 0.25 cm was present around the chitosan capsules, giving an equivalent inhibition of mycelial growth of only 3.1%.
