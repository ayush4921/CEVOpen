<p>When comparing the different in vitro techniques for the use of 
 <italic>C. citratus</italic> oil against 
 <italic>C. gloeosporioides</italic>, it was observed that chitosan-agar-EO capsules had a 100% inhibition on the growth of the pathogen. Significant differences were found between 5 and 30 days after starting treatment, comparable only with the positive control corresponding to the 
 <italic>Trichoderma</italic> antagonism technique (with prolonged effect) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04447-f004">Figure 4</xref>). The other techniques used, such as the poisoned food and wet chamber technique, reached values of inhibition of mycelial growth of 88.5% and 77.5%, respectively, after five days. However, their effectiveness decreased until they became ineffective 30 days after starting treatment (
