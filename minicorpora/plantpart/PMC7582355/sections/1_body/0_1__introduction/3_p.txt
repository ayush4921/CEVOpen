0: Limitations on the direct application of EOs in crops are related to their physicochemical properties, which include low water solubility, ease of oxidation, and rapid volatility [ 7].
1: Rapid volatility substantially reduces the duration of the effect that biocides have.
2: This makes it necessary to develop appropriate application techniques to maximize the effectiveness and the potential of EO based formulations [ 8].
