0: New strategies for integrated crop management, which are more efficient and provide greater coverage, must be developed.
1: Natural pesticides that have low toxicity, high structural diversity, and low persistence can be implemented by utilizing different species whose essential oils (EOs) are found to act as potential biopesticides, allowing for the possibility of greater horticultural exportation [ 5].
2: Antifungal activity against  Colletotrichum sp.
3: ( Glomerellaceae) has been demonstrated with the use of lemongrass EO ( Cymbopogon citratus Poaceae) and its major components, which produced an antifungal index value of 97.7% [ 6].
