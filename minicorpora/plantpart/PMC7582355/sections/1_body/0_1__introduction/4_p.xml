<p>The agroecological conditions in the hot and dry Caribbean region of Colombia demand innovative strategies for the use of EOs so that they are stable and retain their effectiveness over time. EOs that do not lose biocidal capacity are needed so that they can be used in the production systems for crops destined for export. Additionally, the active components of EOs encapsulated in polymeric matrices such as chitosan provide formulations that can be controlled-release, biodegradable, sustainable, and have a low environmental impact [

 <xref rid="B10-molecules-25-04447" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Controlled-release systems are widely used due to their versatility and low cost. They are utilized since they act as a barrier against moisture, oxidation, and solute migration as well as for their mechanical properties, such as tensile strength and tear resistance [

 <xref rid="B12-molecules-25-04447" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. These systems provide protection to the active components of the EO against various abiotic factors such as heat, pH, oxygen, and light, which can alter the effectiveness of the active ingredient [
