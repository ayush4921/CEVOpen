<p>The PCR results were sent to Macrogen (Korea) for sequencing. The forward and reverse sequences were debugged, edited, and aligned using Geneious software (Biomatters, Ltd., Auckland, New Zealand), version 9.1.5. The consensus sequences were compared with those available in the GenBank database using the BLAST application (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) (Rockville Pike, Bethesda MD, USA) to determine the identity of the isolated pieces (Available online as
