<p>The in vitro EO releasing property of microspheres was evaluated under the maximal yield condition of encapsulation using a modified USP dissolution apparatus type I (Electrolab, Dissolution tester, EDT-08Lx, Janki Impex, Gujarat, India) assembled with a 40-mesh basket and 200 mL capacity flasks. Finally, a known volume of ethanol/phosphate buffer solution (1:9

At a predetermined interval, i.e., after 0, 15, 30, 60, 120, 180, 240, 480, and 720 min, a 1 mL sample was collected followed by the replenishment with the same volume of fresh and preheated receptor medium solvent at each sampling interval. The collected samples were analyzed by UV spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA) at 223 nm after appropriate dilution. The experiment was performed in triplicate [
