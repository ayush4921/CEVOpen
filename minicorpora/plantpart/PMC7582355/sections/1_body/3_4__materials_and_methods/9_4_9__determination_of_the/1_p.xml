<p>An assay was performed for the evaluation and determination of the concentration of oil necessary for pathogen inhibition. This was based on the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 1000 ppm, which turned fungicidal at 2000 ppm as described by Mishra and Dubey [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-25-04447" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The system used consisted of two glass containers. The first one was transparent and had a total volume of 129 cm
 <sup>3</sup> minus 25 cm
 <sup>3</sup> of PDA agar, resulting in an actual volume of 104 cm
 <sup>3</sup>. The second one was amber in color, had a total volume of 25 cm
 <sup>3</sup>, and contained the chitosan capsules. Both vessels were connected using a plastic coupling hose with a diameter of 1.2 cm. Tube lengths of 16, 28, and 50 cm were used, which had an equivalent volume of 18, 32, and 57 cm
 <sup>3</sup>, respectively (

These variable lengths of tubing simulated the distances between the ground and the lower leaves of the plant (16 cm hose), from the soil to the middle zone (28 cm hose), and from the soil to the upper leaves (50 cm hose) of a sweet pepper plant cv. Topito. These simulations were done in order to verify whether the volatile effects of EO-agar-chitosan in capsules located in the soil around the base of the plant were able to reach different heights of the plant (Available online as

The length of the hoses was based on the average height of 90 plants 90 days after transplantation, resulting in three sets of volumes equivalent to 147, 161, and 186 cm
