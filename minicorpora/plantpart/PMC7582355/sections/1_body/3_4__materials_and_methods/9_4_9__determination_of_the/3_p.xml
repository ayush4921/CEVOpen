<p>The MIC of the

 <italic>Poaceae</italic>) EO was determined by the volatile effect of sustained release systems using chitosan capsules and taking into consideration the MIC established in the preliminary test. The fungus was inoculated in PDA and exposed to nine treatments equivalent to the three concentrations of oil, 170, 255, and 340 ÂµL (20, 30, and 40 capsules, respectively), in the three systems and using nine controls (corn oil capsules) (
