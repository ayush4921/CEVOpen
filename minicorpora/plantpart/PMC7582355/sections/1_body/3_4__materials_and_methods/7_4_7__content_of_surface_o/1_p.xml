<p>To evaluate the content of oil present on the surface of the capsules, the methodology described by Calvo [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-25-04447" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] was followed. One g of sample was weighed on a screw cap glass bottle, and 7.5 mL of hexane was added. It was vortexed for 2 min at room temperature to extract the free oil. The mixture was decanted and filtered through filter paper and the collected powder was rinsed 3 times with 10 mL of hexane. The powder was dried in an oven at 60 °C to remove any residual solvent, and the final weight was recorded with each sample evaluated in duplicate. The encapsulation efficiency was determined according to the equation:
