<p>The antifungal activity of thirty-one EO and four phytochemicals against 
 <italic>Candida</italic> spp. strains (clinical isolates and reference strains) was analyzed. As shown in Tables 
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>, the most promising EOs were obtained from 
 <italic>Allium tuberosum</italic>, 
 <italic>Cinnamomum cassia</italic>, 
 <italic>Cinnamomum zeylanicum</italic>, and 
 <italic>Coriandrum sativum</italic>. Citral and Thymol were the most active isolated constituents, with MIC values lower than 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, indicating very strong antifungal activity (
