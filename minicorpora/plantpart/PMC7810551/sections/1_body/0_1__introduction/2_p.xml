<p>Yeast colonization of complete dentures occurs mainly due to the strong adhesion of yeast cells to acrylic resin of base materials [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Direct adhesion of yeasts onto dental surfaces is a critical pathogenic factor for the onset of dental stomatitis. Yeast cells can co-aggregate with various bacterial species from the oral plaque and integrated into a robust biofilm pellicle on the surface of dentures. Oral biofilms can be considered microbial reservoirs and significantly affect the oral and systemic health of denture users [
