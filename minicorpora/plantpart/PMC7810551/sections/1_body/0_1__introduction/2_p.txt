0: Yeast colonization of complete dentures occurs mainly due to the strong adhesion of yeast cells to acrylic resin of base materials [ 1].
1: Direct adhesion of yeasts onto dental surfaces is a critical pathogenic factor for the onset of dental stomatitis.
2: Yeast cells can co-aggregate with various bacterial species from the oral plaque and integrated into a robust biofilm pellicle on the surface of dentures.
3: Oral biofilms can be considered microbial reservoirs and significantly affect the oral and systemic health of denture users [ 1,  3].
