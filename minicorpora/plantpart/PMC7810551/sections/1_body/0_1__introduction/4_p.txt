0: This scenario has encouraged the search for novel substances capable of controlling and treating yeast infections while having low toxicity to the host.
1: Some naturally occurring products are considered an important source of new molecules with biological properties, displaying antifungal efficacy comparable or stronger than that of drugs currently available for clinical use.
2: Essential oils (EOs) are a class of natural products with pharmacological properties, which include antimicrobial, antiseptic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activities [ 5 9].
3: These compounds are described as a mixture of volatile constituents produced as secondary metabolites by aromatic plants.
4: With the chemical characteristic of lipophilicity, EOs have the ability to interact with fungal cell membranes and lipid structures.
5: Among their mechanisms of action, EO can disrupt the activity of enzymes involved in ergosterol synthesis or complex with membrane ergosterol, thereby creating pores in the membrane and disrupting permeability [ 10 12].
6: In addition, EO can affect cell wall biosynthesis, interfere with protein synthesis or cell division, and stimulate the production of reactive oxygen species, causing growth inhibition or cell death [ 13,  14].
7: In this literature review, we present the main scientific findings on the antifungal activity of EO and their isolated phytochemicals on  Candida spp.
8: commonly responsible for oral infections.
9: In vitro and clinical (controlled clinical trials in humans) studies were selected and are further discussed in this review.
