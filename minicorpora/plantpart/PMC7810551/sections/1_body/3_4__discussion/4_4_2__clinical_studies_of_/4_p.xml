<p>This literature review shows that the most promising EOs were obtained from 
 <italic>Allium tubeorosum</italic>, 
 <italic>Cinnamomum cassia</italic>, 
 <italic>Cinnamomum zeylanicum</italic>, and 
 <italic>Coriandrum sativum</italic> L. Among the phytochemicals, the citral and the thymol were the most active. The clinical trials selected in this review provided evidence that the EO from 
 <italic>Pelargonium graveolens</italic> and 
 <italic>Zataria multiflora</italic> are potentially effective to treat oral candidiasis. Further nonclinical and clinical studies with these EO are warranted to determine their potential use and safety for the treatment of oral candidiasis.
