  <title>Background</title>
  <p id="Par1">With declining wild fish populations, farmed salmon has gained popularity as a source for healthy long-chain highly unsaturated fatty acids (LC-HUFA). However, the introduction of plant oil in farmed salmon feeds has reduced the content of these beneficial LC-HUFA. The synthetic capability for LC-HUFAs depends upon the dietary precursor fatty acids and the genetic potential, thus there is a need for in-depth understanding of LC-HUFA synthetic genes and their interactions with other genes involved in lipid metabolism. Several key genes of LC-HUFA synthesis in salmon belong to the fatty acid desaturases 2 (
   <italic>fads2</italic>) family. The present study applied whole transcriptome analysis on two CRISPR-mutated salmon strains (crispants), 1) 
   <italic>Δ6abc/5</italic>
   <sup>Mt</sup> with mutations in 
   <italic>Δ5fads2, Δ6fads2-a, Δ6fads2-b and Δ6fads2-c</italic> genes
   <italic>,</italic> and 2) 
   <italic>Δ6bc</italic>
   <sup>Mt</sup> with mutations in 
   <italic>Δ6fads2-b and Δ6fads2-c</italic> genes. Our purpose is to evaluate the genetic effect 
   <italic>fads2</italic> mutations have on other lipid metabolism pathways in fish, as well as to investigate mosaicism in a commercial species with a very long embryonal period.

  <title>Results</title>
  <p id="Par2">Both 
   <italic>Δ6abc/5</italic>
   <sup>Mt</sup> and 
   <italic>Δ6bc</italic>
   <sup>Mt</sup> crispants demonstrated high percentage of indels within all intended target genes, though different indel types and percentage were observed between individuals. The 
   <italic>Δ6abc/5</italic>
   <sup>Mt</sup> fish displayed several disruptive indels which resulted in over 100 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) enriched in lipid metabolism pathways in liver. This includes up-regulation of 
   <italic>srebp1</italic> genes which are known key transcription regulators of lipid metabolism as well as a number of down-stream genes involved in fatty acid 
   <italic>de-novo</italic> synthesis, fatty acid 
   <italic>β</italic>-oxidation and lipogenesis. Both 
   <italic>elovl5</italic> and 
   <italic>elovl2</italic> genes were not changed, suggesting that the genes were not targeted by Srebp1. The mutation of 
   <italic>Δ6bc</italic>
   <sup>Mt</sup> surprisingly resulted in over 3000 DEGs which were enriched in factors encoding genes involved in mRNA regulation and stability.

  <title>Conclusions</title>
  <p id="Par3">CRISPR-Cas9 can efficiently mutate multiple 
   <italic>fads2</italic> genes simultaneously in salmon. The results of the present study have provided new information on the transcriptional regulations of lipid metabolism genes after reduction of LC-HUFA synthesis pathways in salmon.
