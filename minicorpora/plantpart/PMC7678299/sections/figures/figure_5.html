 <caption> Differential expression analysis in liver between wildtype (WT) and mutated salmon. a Number of up-regulated and down-regulated differential expressed genes (DEGs, q &lt; 0.05 &amp; |log2FC| &gt; 0.5) either between WT and Δ6abc/5-mutated salmon, or between WT and Δ6bc-mutated salmon, or between WT salmon fed plant oil and fish oil. b Significantly ( p &lt; 0.005) enriched KEGG pathways of the DEGs. Hypergeometric test was applied based on the number of DEGs versus total genes annotated to each KEGG pathway </caption>
