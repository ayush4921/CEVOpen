  <p>Differential expression analysis in liver between wildtype (WT) and mutated salmon. 
   <bold>a</bold> Number of up-regulated and down-regulated differential expressed genes (DEGs, q &lt; 0.05 &amp; |log2FC| &gt; 0.5) either between WT and 
   <italic>Δ6abc/5</italic>-mutated salmon, or between WT and 
   <italic>Δ6bc</italic>-mutated salmon, or between WT salmon fed plant oil and fish oil. 
   <bold>b</bold> Significantly (
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.005) enriched KEGG pathways of the DEGs. Hypergeometric test was applied based on the number of DEGs versus total genes annotated to each KEGG pathway
