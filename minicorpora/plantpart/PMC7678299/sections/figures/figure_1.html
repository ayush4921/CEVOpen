 <caption> a Circos plot showing the different target sites of the CRISPR gRNAs. Gene ∆5fads2, ∆6fads2-a and ∆6fads2-c have multiple transcripts while yellow boxes indicate exons of each transcript. b: Boxplot showing the maximum proportion of insertions/deletions (indels) within the CRISPR gRNA target site as identified by AmpliSeq. Different color indicates liver (L) or white muscle (WM) tissues from WT, ∆6abc/5 mutant or ∆6bc mutant salmon. Each dot indicates L or WM tissue of an individual fish. c: Bar plots showing the (SnpEff) predicted impact of the indel on the respective main transcript by individual. Impacts are classified as: HIGH = The variant is assumed to have high (disruptive) impact in the protein; MODERATE = A non-disruptive variant that might change protein effectiveness; LOW = The variant is assumed to be mostly harmless; WT = Wild type/no indel. Each bar of the figure represents data of an individual fish </caption>
