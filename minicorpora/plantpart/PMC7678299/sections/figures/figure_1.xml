   <bold>a</bold> Circos plot showing the different target sites of the CRISPR gRNAs. Gene 
   <italic>∆5fads2</italic>, 
   <italic>∆6fads2-a</italic> and 
   <italic>∆6fads2-c</italic> have multiple transcripts while yellow boxes indicate exons of each transcript. 
   <bold>b</bold>: Boxplot showing the maximum proportion of insertions/deletions (indels) within the CRISPR gRNA target site as identified by AmpliSeq. Different color indicates liver (L) or white muscle (WM) tissues from WT, 
   <italic>∆6abc/5</italic> mutant or 
   <italic>∆6bc</italic> mutant salmon. Each dot indicates L or WM tissue of an individual fish. 
   <bold>c</bold>: Bar plots showing the (SnpEff) predicted impact of the indel on the respective main transcript by individual. Impacts are classified as: HIGH = The variant is assumed to have high (disruptive) impact in the protein; MODERATE = A non-disruptive variant that might change protein effectiveness; LOW = The variant is assumed to be mostly harmless; WT = Wild type/no indel. Each bar of the figure represents data of an individual fish
