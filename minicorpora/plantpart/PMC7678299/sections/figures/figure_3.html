 <caption> Expression of LC-HUFA synthesis genes in wildtype (WT), Δ6abc/5 Mt and Δ6bc Mt salmon fed with either plant oil or fish oil diet. Gene expression are shown in transcript per million (TPM) value which is raw counts normalised by both library size and mRNA length. Different letter indicates genes which were differentially expressed ( q &lt; 0.05 &amp; |log2FC| &gt; 0.5) </caption>
