  <p>Expression change of liver genes involved in lipid metabolism after 
   <italic>Δ6abc/5</italic>mutation. 
   <bold>a</bold> Expression changes of genes in Log2 fold change between 
   <italic>Δ6abc/5</italic>
   <sup>
    <italic>MT</italic>
   </sup> and WT salmon. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs, 
   <italic>q</italic> &lt; 0.05 &amp; |log2FC| &gt; 0.5) are labelled, except three genes with asterix (*) which had high log2 fold change but not significant (
   <italic>q</italic> &gt; 0.05) 
   <bold>b</bold> Correlation between gene expression and DHA content in phospholipid. Three fish individuals of each diet (plant oil or fish oil) and genetic (WT or 
   <italic>Δ6abc/5</italic>
   <sup>
    <italic>MT</italic>
   </sup>) group were included in the analysis. Data of DHA measurement was acquired from Datsomor
