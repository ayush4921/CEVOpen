 <caption> Expression change of liver genes involved in lipid metabolism after Δ6abc/5mutation. a Expression changes of genes in Log2 fold change between Δ6abc/5 MT and WT salmon. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs, q &lt; 0.05 &amp; |log2FC| &gt; 0.5) are labelled, except three genes with asterix (*) which had high log2 fold change but not significant ( q &gt; 0.05) b Correlation between gene expression and DHA content in phospholipid. Three fish individuals of each diet (plant oil or fish oil) and genetic (WT or Δ6abc/5 MT ) group were included in the analysis. Data of DHA measurement was acquired from Datsomor et.al, 2019 </caption>
