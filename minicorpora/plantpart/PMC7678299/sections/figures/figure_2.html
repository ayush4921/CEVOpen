 <caption> Detection of exon skipping in Δ6fads2-a in relation to CRISPR. a: Exon structure for the three transcripts encoded by Δ6fads2-a. The targeting site (s1) for the Δ6abc/5 Mt gRNA is enlarged and highlighted in red. b: Schematic drawing on how aligned RNA-seq reads were used to calculate the percentage of exon retention (PER) for a sample. c: Exon skipping was confirmed by using the aligned RNA-seq reads to calculate the PER for each sample (represented as point) </caption>
