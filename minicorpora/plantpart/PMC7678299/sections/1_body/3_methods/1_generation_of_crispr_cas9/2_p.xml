 <sup>Mt</sup> salmon, 281 ± 52 g for

 <sup>Mt</sup> salmon and 250 ± 62 for WT, while the fish under fish oil diet reached 171 ± 36 g, 191 ± 69 g and 241 ± 47 g for the three groups respectively. Liver and muscle tissues from 6 fish per dietary treatment/strain were then sampled and tissues were flash frozen on dry ice and subsequently stored at − 80 °C. During tissue sampling, unnecessary pain was avoided by anesthetizing all fish by placing in freshwater containing 100 mg/L Finquel MS-222 (Tricaine Methanesulfonate) buffered with 100 mg/L sodium bicarbonate (Scan Vacc AS, Hvam, Norway) which caused rapid loss of consciousness (no body or opercula movement), this was followed by euthanasia using a blow to the head.
