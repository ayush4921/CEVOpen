<p id="Par38">The generation of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutated salmon and the corresponding feeding trial was previously published in [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In brief, two types of 
 <italic>fads2</italic> mutants were generated with CRISPR/Cas9 injection into embryos, sperm and eggs were provided by AquaGen (Trondheim, Norway). Both times a single CRISPR guide RNA (gRNA) was used to target different combinations of 
 <italic>fads2</italic> genes simultaneously: A 
 <italic>Δ6abc/5</italic>-mutated (
 <italic>Δ6abc/5</italic>
 <sup>Mt</sup>) salmon strain was generated using a gRNA targeting 
 <italic>Δ6fads2-a</italic> (NCBI Gene ID 100136441), 
 <italic>Δ6fads2-b</italic> (100329172), 
 <italic>Δ6fads2-c</italic> (106584797) and 
 <italic>Δ5fads2</italic> (100136383). A 
 <italic>Δ6bc</italic>-mutated (
 <italic>Δ6bc</italic>
 <sup>Mt</sup>) salmon strain was generated targeting 
 <italic>Δ6fads2-b</italic> and 
 <italic>Δ6fads2-c</italic>. Both strains were co-injected with a gRNA targeting the 
 <italic>slc45a2</italic> (NCBI Gene ID gene 106563596), involved in melanin synthesis [
