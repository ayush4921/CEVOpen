<p id="Par41">Total RNA was extracted from liver of 36 individual fish by using RNeasy Plus Universal Mini kit (Qiagen AS, Hilden, Germany), according to manufacturer’s instruction. The 36 fish comprised 6 fish by group (strain by dietary treatment; two fish / tank). The RNA concentration and quality were assessed by Nanodrop 8000 (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, USA) and Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). All samples had RIN values &gt; 8.5. RNA-seq libraries were prepared using TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina AS, San Diego, CA, USA). The libraries were subsequently sequenced using 100 bp single-end high-throughput mRNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on an Illumina Hiseq 2500 (Illumina AS, San Diego, CA, USA) at Norwegian Sequencing Centre (Oslo, Norway).</p>
