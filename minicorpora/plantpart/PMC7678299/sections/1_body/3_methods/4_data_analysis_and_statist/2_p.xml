<p id="Par43">Expression analysis of the genes was performed using R (v3.4.1). Only genes with a minimum counts level of at least 1 count per million (CPM) in 75% of the samples were kept for further differential expression analysis (DEA). DEA was performed between groups (strain by dietary treatment, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 6), using the generalized linear model (GLM) method in R package edgeR [

 <italic>Δ6abc/5</italic>-mutated salmon versus WT fed fish oil diet, and WT salmon fed plant oil versus fish oil diet. Genes with a false discovery rate (FDR), an adjusted

 <italic>q</italic>) &lt; 0.05 and absolute log2 fold change (|Log2FC|) &gt; 0.5 were considered to be differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the two test conditions. Subsequently, a KEGG ontology enrichment analysis (KOEA) was conducted using edgeR. A hypergeometric test was applied based on number of DEGs compared to total genes annotated to each KEGG pathway, and differences were considered significant when
