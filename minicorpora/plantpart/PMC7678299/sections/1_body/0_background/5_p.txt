0: CRISPR/Cas9 technology has recently been used in salmon to edit genes and generate mutants for  elovl2,  slc45a2 and  dnd [ 18 21].
1: Both guide RNA (gRNA) and Cas9 mRNA are injected into one-cell stage salmon embryos to induce a targeted double-strand break, followed by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) which generates random insertions and deletions (indels) at the target sites that can lead to a non-functional protein.
2: However, because of a three-year generation interval, the generation of homozygous edited salmon is too tedious for research projects.
3: Genetic manipulation efficacy in the founder generation largely depend upon target gene and gRNA design, but there is also a need to address how mosaics differ in the tissues and affects function of the encoded gene product.
4: For this species it is therefore necessary to optimize editing efficiency and reduce the problem of mosaicism in the F0 generation.
5: Compared to teleost model species, the Atlantic salmon embryo develops slowly and hatches after about 80 days, or 500-day degrees (days x temperature in  oC).
6: This developmental pace may lead to degradation of CRISPR components such as CAS9 mRNA or protein and guide RNAs which may have an impact upon mosaicism.
