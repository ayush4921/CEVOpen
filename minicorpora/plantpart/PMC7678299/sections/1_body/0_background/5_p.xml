<p id="Par22">CRISPR/Cas9 technology has recently been used in salmon to edit genes and generate mutants for

 <italic>dnd</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Both guide RNA (gRNA) and Cas9 mRNA are injected into one-cell stage salmon embryos to induce a targeted double-strand break, followed by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) which generates random insertions and deletions (indels) at the target sites that can lead to a non-functional protein. However, because of a three-year generation interval, the generation of homozygous edited salmon is too tedious for research projects. Genetic manipulation efficacy in the founder generation largely depend upon target gene and gRNA design, but there is also a need to address how mosaics differ in the tissues and affects function of the encoded gene product. For this species it is therefore necessary to optimize editing efficiency and reduce the problem of mosaicism in the F0 generation. Compared to teleost model species, the Atlantic salmon embryo develops slowly and hatches after about 80 days, or 500-day degrees (days x temperature in 
 <sup>o</sup>C). This developmental pace may lead to degradation of CRISPR components such as CAS9 mRNA or protein and guide RNA’s which may have an impact upon mosaicism.
