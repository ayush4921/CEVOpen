0: Salmon are capable of synthesizing LC-HUFA through elongation and desaturation of -linolenic (18:3n-3) and linoleic (18:2n-6) acids, and the synthesis is often increased when the fish are given a plant oil diet with low LC-HUFA [ 3].
1: This explains the fact that salmon can tolerate partial substitution of fish oil with plant oil without negative impact on growth rate, feed conversion or any histopathological lesions [ 4].
2: However, the synthesized LC-HUFA in salmon is still not enough to compensate for the reduced LC-HUFA level caused by inclusion of plant oil in diet [ 2].
3: Thus, salmon has limited capability in bioconverting the precursors, 18:3n-3 and 18:2n-6 to essential LC-HUFAs [ 5,  6].
4: In order to further improve the LC-HUFA synthetic capacity in salmon, a better understanding of the regulation of genes involved in LC-HUFA synthesis is needed.
