0: In addition to the LC-HUFA synthesis genes, many other genes involved in fatty acid  de-novo synthesis, fatty acid oxidation and cholesterol biosynthesis are also differentially expressed after feeding plant oil [ 5,  12 14].
1: It is difficult to conclude the reason for the differential expression of lipid metabolism genes since plant oils are devoid of cholesterol and LC-HUFA, and contain high amounts of C 18 PUFA precursors and phytosterols compared to fish oil [ 15 17].
2: In a recent study, we disrupted the LC-HUFA synthesis pathway in salmon by mutating  elovl2 gene using CRISPR/Cas9 technology [ 18].
3: In addition to a decreased DHA content in mutant fish, we were able to identified up-regulation of  fads2 genes as well as several genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis and lipogenesis as consequence of the knock out [ 18].
4: This suggests a systemic change of lipid metabolism regulation in response to the disruption of LC-HUFA synthesis in salmon.
