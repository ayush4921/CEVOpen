<p id="Par23">We have recently used CRISPR/Cas9 to mutate 
 <italic>fads2</italic> genes in salmon which resulted in down-regulation of targeted genes and lower DHA and EPA contents in tissues [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, the impact of impaired LC-HUFA biosynthesis on the regulation of other genes - both from lipid metabolism and globally - was still unclear. In the present study we aimed to further characterize transcriptional regulation of lipid metabolism in 
 <italic>fads2</italic>-mutated salmon by comparing their transcriptomes to wildtype fish. Our study also seeks to provide detailed insights on the effect and distribution of genetic mosaicism in salmon individuals after mutation of 
 <italic>fads2</italic> genes.
