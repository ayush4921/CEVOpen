0: The pathways of LC-HUFA synthesis in salmon involves 4 elongases encoded by  elovl2,  elovl4, elovl5a and  elvol5b and 4 desaturases encoded by  5fads2,  6fads2-a,  6fads2-b and  6fads2-c. All 8 genes have been cloned and functionally characterised through heterologous expression in yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae) [ 7,  8].
1: Both  elovl5a and  elovl5b are mainly involved in elongating C 18 and C 20 fatty acids, while  elovl2 and  elovl4 are involved in elongating C 20 and C 22 [ 8 10].
2: All four  fads genes in salmon are homologs to the human  FADS2 gene.
3: In salmon they have separate functions where double bonds are introduced at C5 ( 5fads2) or C6 ( 6fads2-a,  6fads2-b and  6fads2-c) from the carboxyl end [ 10,  11].
4: Feeding of plant oil often leads to up-regulation of both  elovl and  fads2 genes in salmon, which is likely due to the low LC-HUFA content in the diet [ 5,  12 14].
