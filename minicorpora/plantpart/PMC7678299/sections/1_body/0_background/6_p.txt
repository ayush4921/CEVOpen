0: We have recently used CRISPR/Cas9 to mutate  fads2 genes in salmon which resulted in down-regulation of targeted genes and lower DHA and EPA contents in tissues [ 22].
1: However, the impact of impaired LC-HUFA biosynthesis on the regulation of other genes - both from lipid metabolism and globally - was still unclear.
2: In the present study we aimed to further characterize transcriptional regulation of lipid metabolism in  fads2-mutated salmon by comparing their transcriptomes to wildtype fish.
3: Our study also seeks to provide detailed insights on the effect and distribution of genetic mosaicism in salmon individuals after mutation of  fads2 genes.
