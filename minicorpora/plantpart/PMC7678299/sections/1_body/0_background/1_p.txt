0: Atlantic salmon ( Salmo salar L.) is a popular fish species for human consumption since it contains high amounts of long-chain highly unsaturated fatty acids (LC-HUFA) such as docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3, DHA), eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3, EPA) and arachidonic acid (20:4n-6, ARA).
1: The high LC-HUFA content in farmed salmon originates mainly from dietary inclusions of marine fish oil and fish meal.
2: However, traditional marine fisheries have been exploited to their limits, and with increasing volume of salmon production, dietary marine oil and meal sources have been gradually diluted over the past decades.
3: Plant oils are used to substitute marine oils in aquaculture diets, with an increasing levels from 0% of total lipids in 1990 to 19.2% in 2013 [ 1].
4: This has resulted in a reduction of LC-PUFA levels in salmon flesh since plant oils do not contain LC-PUFA [ 2].
