<p id="Par21">In addition to the LC-HUFA synthesis genes, many other genes involved in fatty acid 
 <italic>de-novo</italic> synthesis, fatty acid oxidation and cholesterol biosynthesis are also differentially expressed after feeding plant oil [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. It is difficult to conclude the reason for the differential expression of lipid metabolism genes since plant oils are devoid of cholesterol and LC-HUFA, and contain high amounts of C
 <sub>18</sub> PUFA precursors and phytosterols compared to fish oil [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In a recent study, we disrupted the LC-HUFA synthesis pathway in salmon by mutating 
 <italic>elovl2</italic> gene using CRISPR/Cas9 technology [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In addition to a decreased DHA content in mutant fish, we were able to identified up-regulation of 
 <italic>fads2</italic> genes as well as several genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis and lipogenesis as consequence of the knock out [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This suggests a systemic change of lipid metabolism regulation in response to the disruption of LC-HUFA synthesis in salmon.
