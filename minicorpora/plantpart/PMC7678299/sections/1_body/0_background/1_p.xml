<p id="Par18">Atlantic salmon (
 <italic>Salmo salar</italic> L.) is a popular fish species for human consumption since it contains high amounts of long-chain highly unsaturated fatty acids (LC-HUFA) such as docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3, DHA), eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3, EPA) and arachidonic acid (20:4n-6, ARA). The high LC-HUFA content in farmed salmon originates mainly from dietary inclusions of marine fish oil and fish meal. However, traditional marine fisheries have been exploited to their limits, and with increasing volume of salmon production, dietary marine oil and meal sources have been gradually diluted over the past decades. Plant oils are used to substitute marine oils in aquaculture diets, with an increasing levels from 0% of total lipids in 1990 to 19.2% in 2013 [
