<p id="Par35">To further investigate the relationship between key transcription factors and lipid metabolism genes, we compared the expression changes of the 230 lipid metabolism genes except LC-HUFA synthesis genes, either between mutated and WT salmon fed plant oil, or between mutated and WT salmon fed fish oil, or between WT salmon fed plant oil and fish oil (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a). Several 
 <italic>agpat3</italic> and 
 <italic>acsbg</italic> genes were significantly (
 <italic>q</italic> &lt; 0.05 &amp; |log2FC| &gt; 0.5) up-regulated in plant oil mutated salmon together with up-regulated 
 <italic>srebp1</italic>. The function of the Srebp-1 transcription factor in salmon is likely similar to its function in mammals, which works as a key transcription factor for hepatic lipogenesis, and 
 <italic>agpat3</italic> and 
 <italic>acsbg</italic> genes are likely the key target genes of salmon Srebp-1. The same 
 <italic>acsbg</italic>, 
 <italic>agpat3</italic> and 
 <italic>srebp1</italic> genes were also up-regulated when the 
 <italic>elovl2</italic> gene was CRISPR-mutated in salmon, confirming an increase of fatty acid acylation and lipogenesis in response to decreased tissue DHA content (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Other typical mammalian SREBP-1 targets, 
 <italic>fasn</italic>, 
 <italic>acc1</italic> and 
 <italic>elovl6</italic> genes of fatty acid synthesis and elongation pathways were also up-regulated, but not significantly (
 <italic>q</italic> &gt; 0.05) in mutated salmon compared to WT under the plant oil diet (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). However, the transcriptional increase of these genes was much higher and significant (
 <italic>q</italic> &lt; 0.05) in WT salmon fed the plant oil diet compared to fish oil. This means that the genes of fatty acid synthesis and elongation in salmon were not merely targeted by Srebp-1, but by other transcription factors, likely Srebp-2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] or Ppar-γ [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Genes of cholesterol metabolism including 
 <italic>hmgcrab</italic>, 
 <italic>mvd-a</italic> and 
 <italic>sqlea-a</italic> were only highly up-regualted in WT fed plant oil diet versus fish oil, while no transcription change was observed in 
 <italic>Δ6abc/5</italic>
 <sup>Mt</sup> versus WT salmon. Several studies have found up-regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis and 
 <italic>srebp2</italic> genes in salmon fed plant oils [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The present study has supported that the relationship between 
 <italic>srebp2</italic> and cholesterol biosynthesis genes is quite conserved in salmon as in mammals, and suggests that the SREBP binding sites of cholesterol biosynthesis genes were 
 <italic>srebp2</italic>-specific (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].
