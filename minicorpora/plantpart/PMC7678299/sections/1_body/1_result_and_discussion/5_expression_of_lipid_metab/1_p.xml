 <sup>Mt</sup> fish were included for further transcriptomic analysis to understand the transcriptional regulation of lipid metabolism after disrupting LC-HUFA synthesis genes. Here we discussed DEGs of lipid metabolism pathways that were enriched in 
 <italic>Δ6abc/5</italic>
 <sup>Mt</sup> versus WT salmon, aiming to understand the regulatory network of lipid metabolism genes in response to 
 <italic>Δ6abc/5</italic>
 <sup>Mt</sup>. The 
 <italic>Δ6abc/5</italic> mutant showed 14 (13.4%) differentially expressed lipid metabolism genes when fed plant oil diet, while fewer (7 genes, 5.8%) lipid DEGs were identified in salmon fed the fish oil diet (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The higher numbers of DEGs in 
 <italic>Δ6abc/5</italic>
 <sup>Mt</sup> salmon fed the plant oil diet suggest a compensatory response to the combined effects of impaired endogenous LC-HUFA biosynthesis and reduced dietary LC-HUFA levels. On the other hand, the reduced number of lipid DEGs in 
 <italic>Δ6abc/5</italic>
 <sup>Mt</sup> salmon fed the fish oil diet suggests an impact of dietary LC-HUFA levels on gene transcription, most likely an end-product-mediated inhibition. Nevertheless, 4 lipid DEGs were identified in 
 <italic>Δ6abc/5</italic>
 <sup>Mt</sup> fish fed both plant oil and fish oil experimental diets including 
 <italic>Δ5fad</italic>, 
 <italic>Δ6fad-a</italic>, 
 <italic>abcd1</italic> and 
 <italic>acc2</italic>. Besides the two CRISPR-targeted genes, the down-regulation of 
 <italic>acc2</italic> and up-regulation of 
 <italic>abcd1</italic> suggests an increase of the fatty acid 
 <italic>β</italic>-oxidation pathway for energy expenditure after CRISPR-mutation [
