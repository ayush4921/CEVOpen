<p id="Par33">Low levels of LC-HUFA often induce hepatic expression of 
 <italic>Δ5fads2</italic> and 
 <italic>Δ6fads2-a</italic> genes as shown in our previous 
 <italic>elovl2</italic>-mutated salmon [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. On the other hand, reduced DHA level has little effect on the expression of 
 <italic>elovl5</italic> and 
 <italic>elovl2</italic> genes as shown in the present 
 <italic>Δ6abc/5</italic>
 <sup>Mt</sup> salmon (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). However, the expression of 
 <italic>elovl2</italic> and 
 <italic>elovl5</italic> genes are often up-regulated in fish fed plant oil compared to fish oil diets (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Although plant oil diets also contains lower DHA and EPA, our data has shown that the expression of 
 <italic>elovl</italic> genes was more likely induced by other differences between fish oil and plant oil diets. Sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs) are suggested to be involved in regulating lipid metabolism in both mammals and fish [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Atlantic salmon has four 
 <italic>srebp1</italic> paralogous genes, 
 <italic>srebp1a</italic>, 
 <italic>srebp1b</italic>, 
 <italic>srebp1c</italic> and 
 <italic>srebp1d</italic> which are all orthologs of the zebrafish 
 <italic>srebp1</italic> gene (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Both 
 <italic>Δ6abc/5</italic>
 <sup>Mt</sup> and low LC-HUFA diets resulted in increased transcription of all four 
 <italic>srebp1</italic> genes in salmon (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> and Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The transcription of the 
 <italic>srebp1</italic> genes was negatively (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) correlated to the DHA level in phospholipids. On the other hand, transcription of 
 <italic>srebp2</italic> genes were not up-regulated in mutated versus WT salmon, and are not correlated to DHA level (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> b). The different regulation of 
 <italic>srebp1</italic> and 
 <italic>srebp2</italic> transcription is consistent with previous studies in mammals, suggesting that 
 <italic>srebp1</italic> transcription is regulated by DHA levels in salmon, while 
 <italic>srebp2</italic> transcription is more likely to be induced by low cholesterol levels in the plant oil diet [
