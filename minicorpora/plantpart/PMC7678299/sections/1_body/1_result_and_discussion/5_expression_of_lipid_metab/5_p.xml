<p id="Par36">CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutation of 
 <italic>fads2</italic> genes in 
 <italic>Δ6abc/5</italic> also affected the fatty acid 
 <italic>β</italic>-oxidation pathway in salmon. This was indicated by a strong down-regulation of 
 <italic>acc2</italic> gene following 
 <italic>Δ6abc/5</italic>
 <sup>Mt</sup> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Unlike the 
 <italic>acc1</italic> gene which is mostly involved in 
 <italic>de-novo</italic> fatty acid synthesis in the cytosol, the 
 <italic>acc2</italic> gene in mammals produces mitochondria-associated malonyl-CoA which is a negative regulator of CPT1 and inhibits mitochondria 
 <italic>β</italic>-oxidation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Therefore, the down-regualtion of 
 <italic>acc2</italic> in 
 <italic>Δ6abc/5</italic>
 <sup>Mt</sup> salmon could suggest an increased fatty acid 
 <italic>β</italic>-oxidation after disrutpion of LC-HUFA sythetic pathway. This could be regulated by PPAR which is key regualtor of fatty acid catabolism [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Similar to 
 <italic>srebp1</italic>, we also found a negative correlation between DHA level and two 
 <italic>ppara-a</italic> genes, though their expression levels were not changed after 
 <italic>Δ6abc/5</italic> mutation. As PUFA and their derivatives are known natural ligands of PPAR, the activation of PPAR and their target genes including fatty acid 
 <italic>β</italic>-oxidation may not rely on increased transcirption of PPAR genes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The increased 
 <italic>β</italic>-oxidation was probably due to accumulation of 18:3n-3, 18:2n-6, and other intermediate fatty acids in the LC-HUFA synthesis pathway which cannot be synthesised further to DHA and EPA after disruption of 
 <italic>fads2</italic> genes. These fatty acids were most likely consumed alternatively in 
 <italic>β</italic>-oxidation which was activated by the PPAR transcription factor [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Feeding of plant oil diets also induced 
 <italic>cpt1a</italic> and 
 <italic>abcd1</italic>, which are key genes involved in import of fatty acids into mitochondria and peroxisomes for catabolism (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). However, a paralog gene 
 <italic>cpt1b</italic> was down-regulated both after 
 <italic>fads2</italic>-mutation and feeding plant oil diet. The reason for the down-regualtion is unclear and whether it would affect fatty acid 
 <italic>β</italic>-oxidation needs to be further investigated. One possible explanation is that malonyl-CoA produced by 
 <italic>acc1</italic> or 
 <italic>acc2</italic> is less organelle-specific in salmon, and that the 
 <italic>cpt1b</italic> gene could be inhibited by malonyl-CoA produced by 
 <italic>acc1</italic> in 
 <italic>de-novo</italic> fatty acid synthesis.
