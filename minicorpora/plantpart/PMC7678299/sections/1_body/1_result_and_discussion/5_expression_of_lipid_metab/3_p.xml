<p id="Par34">By comparing salmon gene promoter sequences to 6 transcription factor binding sites databases (CISBP, HUMAN.H10MO.B, HT-SELEX2, HumanTF, JASPAR, TRANSFAC), we identified 235 lipid metabolism genes with potential sterol regulatory elements (SRE), the Srebp binding sites, between 1000 bp upstream to 200 bp downstream from transcription starting sites (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). This includes 
 <italic>Δ5fads2</italic>, 
 <italic>Δ6fads2-a</italic>, 
 <italic>elovl5-a</italic>, 
 <italic>elovl5-b</italic> and 
 <italic>elovl2</italic> which are the major genes in LC-HUFA synthesis pathway. A recent study showed that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated editing of 
 <italic>elovl2</italic> in salmon has increased transcription of 
 <italic>srebp1</italic>, 
 <italic>Δ6fads2</italic> and 
 <italic>Δ5fads2</italic> genes together with decreased LC-HUFA content, supporting the regulation of 
 <italic>fads2</italic> genes by the Srebp-1 transcription regulator (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, the salmon Srebp-1 transcription factor is unlikely to induce expression of 
 <italic>elovl5</italic> and 
 <italic>elovl2</italic>. This was because the expression of both 
 <italic>elovl</italic> genes were stable in 
 <italic>Δ6abc/5</italic>
 <sup>
  <italic>Mt</italic>
 </sup> compared to WT salmon, though 
 <italic>srebp1</italic> expression was upregulated. The 
 <italic>elovl5</italic> genes were also stable in 
 <italic>elovl2</italic>-mutated salmon [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. One possible reason is that the SRE in promoter regions of 
 <italic>elovl5</italic> and 
 <italic>elovl2</italic> genes may be more efficient for binding Srebp-2 rather than Srebp-1 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], or that other transcription factors such as liver X receptor (LXR) are responsible stimulation of 
 <italic>elovl</italic> genes in salmon under a plant oil diet. On the other hand, mammalian SREBP-1 can target both fatty acid desaturase (
 <italic>FADS2</italic>) and elongase (
 <italic>ELVOL5</italic>) genes and regulate LC-HUFA synthesis [
