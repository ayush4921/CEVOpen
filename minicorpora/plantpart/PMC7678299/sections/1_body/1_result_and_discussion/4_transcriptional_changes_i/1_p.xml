<p id="Par29">An average of 29 million reads were mapped on to the salmon genome ICSASG_v2. From a total of 55,304 annotated genes, 23,114 genes had at least 1 count per million (CPM) in 25% of the samples, and were considered for subsequent analysis. By applying principal component analysis (PCA) on Log2 CPM of the top 1000 most variant genes, we identified a clear separation of plant oil and fish oil samples between PC1 (explaining 34.8% of the observed variation) and PC2 (8.3%) as well as a separation of WT and
