<p id="Par31">To further understand the functions of DEGs between crispant and WT salmon, we conducted a KEGG enrichment analysis by comparing the number of DEGs to the total number of genes in each KEGG pathway (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> b). The DEGs of 
 <italic>Δ6abc/5</italic>
 <sup>Mt</sup> salmon were not only enriched in the fatty acid metabolism pathway, but also the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) signalling pathway which is involved in many metabolic pathways including fatty acid synthesis and catabolism [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. This supports previous studies, indicating PPAR to be the key transcriptional regulator of fatty acid metabolism in salmon [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Differential regulation of these pathways was likely caused by decreased EPA and DHA, and consequential accumulation of 18:3n-3 and 18:2n-6 after disruption of the LC-HUFA synthesis pathway [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Accumulated 18:3n-3 and 18:2n-6 could not be synthesised further to DHA and EPA after disruption of 
 <italic>fads2</italic> genes. Instead they were most likely consumed by 
 <italic>β</italic>-oxidation which was activated by the PPAR transcription factor [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Similar enrichment of fatty acid metabolism and PPAR signalling pathways was also found in the DEGs between WT salmon fed plant oil and fish oil (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> b). Additionally, the sterol biosynthesis pathway was enriched for DEGs between WT salmon fed plant oil and fish oil, but was not enriched for the DEGs between 
 <italic>fads2</italic> mutants versus WT fish (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> b). Indicating that the LC-HUFA level and PPAR has little effect on cholesterol biosynthesis in salmon, which is more likely regulated by other biochemical signals such as low cholesterol level and other transcription factors including sterol regulatory binding protein 2 (SREBP2) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Many other pathways were also enriched for the DEGs of WT fed plant oil versus fish oil, such as amino acid biosynthesis and RNA transport. This suggests that dietary inclusion of plant oil has more complex impact on salmon than just reducing LC-HUFA and cholesterol levels in the fish body. Our study has successfully separated the effect of low LC-HUFA level from other effects of plant oil inclusion, however more research is required to understand the complete regulatory network in response to the change of plant oil in the diet. Surprisingly, no lipid metabolism pathways were enriched in

 <sup>Mt</sup> salmon compared to WT, regardless of dietary LC-HUFA level. This was in accordance to the fatty acid composition in liver, where no significant difference was found between 
 <italic>Δ6bc</italic>
 <sup>Mt</sup> salmon and WT [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The DEGs were likely more enriched in mRNA regulation pathways, including mRNA surveillance and spliceosome pathways. Nevertheless, the reason for the high number of DEGs in 
 <italic>Δ6bc</italic>
 <sup>Mt</sup> salmon and their enriched pathways needs to be further investigated.
