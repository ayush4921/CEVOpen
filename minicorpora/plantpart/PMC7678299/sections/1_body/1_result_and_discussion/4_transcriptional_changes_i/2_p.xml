<p id="Par30">Differential expression analysis (DEA) was done by contrasting crispants and WT salmon separately under plant oil and fish oil diets. This resulted in 121 differentially expressed genes (DEGs, q &lt; 0.05 &amp; |log2FC| &gt; 0.5) in

 <sup>Mt</sup> salmon compared to WT. This includes 1156 genes identified in crispant salmon when fed a fish oil diet and 1348 DEGs identified in salmon fed a plant oil diet. A total number of 3987 DEGs was found in WT salmon fed a plant oil diet compared to fish oil, while the numbers of diet-associated DEGs were 4179 and 2057 in
