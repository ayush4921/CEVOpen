<p id="Par27">Many of the CRISPR induced structural variants introduce premature termination codons likely to trigger mRNA degradation by nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Indeed, we found that CRISPR-targeted 
 <italic>Δ5fads2</italic>, 
 <italic>Δ6fads2-a</italic> and 
 <italic>Δ6fads2-b</italic> genes were strongly down-regulated (
 <italic>q</italic> &lt; 0.05) in 
 <italic>Δ6abc/5</italic>
 <sup>Mt</sup> salmon compared to WT regardless of the dietary treatment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). In 
 <italic>Δ6bc</italic>
 <sup>Mt</sup> salmon, the CRISPR-targeted 
 <italic>Δ6fads2-b</italic> gene was down-regulated compared to WT, but the levels of down-regulation were less clear than in 
 <italic>Δ6abc/5</italic>
 <sup>Mt</sup> salmon. Surprisingly, the expression of 
 <italic>Δ5fads2</italic> and 
 <italic>Δ6fads2-a</italic> genes was also down-regulated in 
 <italic>Δ6bc</italic>
 <sup>Mt</sup> salmon, though both genes were not targeted by 
 <italic>Δ6bc</italic>
 <sup>Mt</sup> gRNAs. The expression of 
 <italic>Δ6fads2-c</italic> gene was generally very low, suggesting that it is unlikely to play a major role in salmon liver. This low level expression may also explain that 
 <italic>Δ6fads2-c</italic> was not affected by CRISPR mutations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The expression of other genes in the LC-HUFA synthesis pathway, 
 <italic>elovl2</italic>, 
 <italic>elovl5-a</italic> and 
 <italic>elovl5-b</italic>, was stable between 
 <italic>Δ6abc/5</italic>
 <sup>Mt</sup>, 
 <italic>Δ6bc</italic>
 <sup>Mt</sup> and WT salmon.
