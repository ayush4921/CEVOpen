<p id="Par28">The NMD-mediated mRNA degradation, absence of exon 6 in 
 <italic>Δ6fads2-a</italic> transcripts, and other CRISPR-induced mutations such as out-of-frame mutations are expected to produce non-functional enzyme proteins that would ultimately disrupt LC-HUFA biosynthesis in the fish. Indeed, analysis of tissue composition of LC-HUFA coupled with assays of desaturation and elongation activities in liver showed clear impacts of the CRISPR-mutations. The mutation of 
 <italic>Δ6abc/5</italic> genes in salmon resulted in significant reduction of DHA and EPA in phospholipids compared to WT [
