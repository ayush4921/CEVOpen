 <italic>fads2</italic> as well as the 
 <italic>slc45a2</italic> genes of fish from both 
 <italic>Δ6abc/5</italic>
 <sup>Mt</sup> and 
 <italic>Δ6bc</italic>
 <sup>Mt</sup> strains were confirmed by using AmpliSeq. All fish injected with CRISPR/Cas9 carried structural variants at the respective gRNA target sites (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> b). For all individuals from both CRISPR strains we observed a high degree of mosaicism at each of the respective gRNA target sites (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). This suggests that Cas9-induced editing continues after the one-cell stage of the embryos. In order to better understand the consequences of the different structural variants on a phenotypic level, we predicted variant effects using SnpEff and summarised the results according to the impact category (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). The majority of structural variants across all individuals were predicted to have “high” impact, meaning to have a likely disruptive effect on the protein function. Nevertheless, our analysis also showed that many of the individuals from the two CRISPR strains still carried a considerable amount of the WT genotype (non-CRISPR mutated). Therefore, we believe it is more correct to consider the two resulting CRISPR strains as 
 <italic>fads2</italic> knock-downs rather than knockouts. The 
 <italic>Δ6abc/5</italic>
 <sup>Mt</sup> gRNA targeted sequence right after the cytochrome b5-like domain of 
 <italic>fads2</italic> genes, while 
 <italic>Δ6bc</italic>
 <sup>Mt</sup> gRNA targeted sequences on exon 1 before all protein domains. Therefore, the out-of-frame mutations in 
 <italic>Δ6abc/5</italic>
 <sup>Mt</sup> and 
 <italic>Δ6bc</italic>
 <sup>Mt</sup> were expected to disrupt characteristic domains identified in fatty acyl desaturases, though our CRISPR-target sites did not specifically fall within protein domains. These out-of-frame mutations identified by Ampliseq could explain the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) of the mutant mRNA and impaired biosynthesis of LC-PUFA in 
 <italic>Δ6abc/5</italic>
 <sup>Mt</sup> fish [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].
