<p id="Par24">The two strains of Atlantic salmon carrying CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutations were generated as described earlier [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In both strains CRISPR/Cas9 mediated mutations were induced using a single CRISPR gRNA targeting multiple genes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). The gRNA of 
 <italic>Δ6abc/5</italic>
 <sup>Mt</sup> salmon targeted 
 <italic>Δ6fads2-a</italic>, 
 <italic>Δ6fads2-b</italic>, 
 <italic>Δ6fads2-c</italic> and 
 <italic>Δ5fads2</italic> genes, while the gRNA of 
 <italic>Δ6bc</italic>
 <sup>Mt</sup> targeted 
 <italic>Δ6fad2s-b</italic> and 
 <italic>Δ6fads2-c</italic>. Both 
 <italic>Δ6abc/5</italic> and 
 <italic>Δ6bc</italic> mutant salmon were co-injected with a CRISPR gRNA targeting 
 <italic>slc45a2</italic> which induces an albino phenotype and served as visual control in our experiment.
