<p id="Par26">Interestingly, we found that CRISPR/Cas9 induced mutations of 
 <italic>Δ6abc/5</italic>
 <sup>Mt</sup> gRNA in the 
 <italic>Δ6fads2-a</italic> gene were affecting splicing of exonic part 6 (harbouring the CRISPR target site; exonic part 6 corresponds to exon 4 in transcript: XM_014170212.1; exon 3 in XM_014170213.1). Analysis of exonic-part 6 retention in 
 <italic>Δ6abc/5</italic>-mutated salmon using RNA-seq data revealed mis-splicing of the 
 <italic>Δ6fads2-a</italic> transcript resulting in the skipping of exonic part 6 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Exon skipping caused by CRISPR/Cas9-generated mutations was observed previously in both cell lines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and genetically modified organisms including zebrafish [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and salmon [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. CRISPR induced mis-splicing is mostly caused by one of two mechanisms: i) indels generated by a CRISPR-mutation affects the exon-intron boundaries or ii) indels promote exon skipping by disrupting an exon splicing enhancer or introducing an exon splicing silencer within the targeted exon [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. However, neither mechanism fits to our study. This was because other 
 <italic>Δ6abc/5</italic>
 <sup>Mt</sup> gRNA target sites on 
 <italic>Δ5fads2</italic>, 
 <italic>Δ6fads2-b</italic> and 
 <italic>Δ6fads2-c</italic> genes contained identical sequences and showed the same distance to exon-intron boundaries, but did not affect splicing. Nonetheless, the skipping of exon 6 in 
 <italic>Δ6fads2-a</italic> transcripts will result in the production of truncated proteins that lack 37 amino acids, which suggests deleterious effects on protein structure and functions.
