<p>The dominant genera across all phytoremediation species were 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). However, it was more dominant in 
 <italic>H. rufa</italic>. Generally, besides 
 <italic>Pseudomonas,</italic> other genera observed in all phytoremediation species were 
 <italic>Luteimonas, Sphingomonas, Mycobacterium, Bacillus,</italic> and 
 <italic>Fusibacter.</italic> These were relatively more abundant in manure treated hydrocarbon-contaminated soil (T4) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Compared to the rest, 
 <italic>H. rufa</italic> had more 
 <italic>Bacillus</italic>, 
 <italic>Fusibacter,</italic> and 
 <italic>Rhodococcus.</italic> Plant species 
 <italic>G. barbadense</italic> was mainly associated with bacteria genera 
 <italic>Luteimonas</italic> and 
 <italic>Mycobacterium,</italic> while 
 <italic>T. diversifolia</italic> was inhabited by 
 <italic>Bacillus</italic> and 
 <italic>Luteimonas</italic>. The rhizosphere of 
 <italic>O. longistaminata</italic> was dominated by 
 <italic>Bacillus, Fusibacter,</italic> and 
 <italic>Luteimonas,</italic> while S
 <italic>. arundinaceum</italic> was largely inhabited by 
 <italic>Sphingomonas.</italic> There was an increase in bacterial diversity in manure treated hydrocarbon contaminated soil due to addition of cattle manure (
