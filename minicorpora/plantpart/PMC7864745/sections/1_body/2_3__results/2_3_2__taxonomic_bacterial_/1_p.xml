<p>The sequences were classified into 33 phyla, 54 classes, 128 orders, 268 families, and 511 genera of bacteria at 80% bootstrap. Treatments containing plant species and manure (T3) had the highest number of phyla and genera. This was followed by treatments containing plant species, manure, and hydrocarbon (T4), while plant species and hydrocarbon (T2) had the least number of phyla and genera. The most and least abundant rhizobacteria communities were noted in treatments with plant species, manure and hydrocarbon (T4) and plant species and hydrocarbon (T2), respectively. Similarly, most and least diversities were observed in T4 (
