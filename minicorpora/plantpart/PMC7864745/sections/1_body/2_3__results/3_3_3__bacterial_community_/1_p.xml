<p>The richness and diversity of bacterial communities significantly differed (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.000) between plant species in all tested parameters except Simpson's index (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In all the five-plant species, there was high abundance of bacterial communities in the treatment with plant only (T1). However, when TPH was added to plant species (T2), there was a significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) decline in abundance as shown by a drop in Chao 1 values across the five phytoremediation species. Addition of cattle manure (T4) to the treatment (plant + TPH) significantly increased (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) bacterial abundance. In 
 <italic>S. arundinaceum</italic>, the communities quadrupled (from 2097 to 8260); in 
 <italic>G. barbadense</italic>, there was multiple increase (from 2781 to 9540) and a near multiple increase in 
 <italic>O. longistaminata</italic> (from 3597 to 9168) and 
 <italic>H. rufa</italic> (from 4304 to 10,310), while in 
 <italic>T. diversifolia</italic>, the communities doubled (from 4223 to 9795).
