<p>The sudden rise in abundance of bacteria communities in the treatment with plant species, hydrocarbon, and manure (T4) was attributed to addition of cattle manure. Largely, manure improves soil physicochemical properties leading to improved conditions for plant and microbial growth. Therefore, the rhizosphere became a hotspot for survival of different bacteria communities thereby accounting for the increased abundance. Moreover, cattle manure contains bacteria strains, which could have enhanced biodegradation of the TPH. In all phytoremediation plant species, there were significant differences (

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) across all treatments. The most abundant phylum was Proteobacteria across all plant species with or without manure and the TPH accounting for about 41.6% of all ASVs, followed by Actinobacteria (12.7%) and Firmicutes (9.8%), of all ASVs (
