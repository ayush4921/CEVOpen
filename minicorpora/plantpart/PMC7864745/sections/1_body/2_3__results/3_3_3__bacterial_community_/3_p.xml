<p>Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria dominated TPH contaminated soils across all plant species (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). For example, 
 <italic>G. barbadense</italic> was mainly associated with Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria. The rhizospheres of 
 <italic>T. diversifolia</italic> and 
 <italic>O. longistaminata</italic> were inhabited by Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. Similarly, the rhizosphere of 
 <italic>S. arundinaceum</italic> was dominated by only Proteobacteria, while the roots of 
 <italic>H. rufa</italic> had a high abundance of Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria.
