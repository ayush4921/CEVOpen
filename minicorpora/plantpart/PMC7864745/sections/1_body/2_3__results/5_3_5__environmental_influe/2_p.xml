<p>Results from principal component analysis (PCA) also revealed separate clustering of bacterial communities between hydrocarbon and non-hydrocarbon-containing treatments. Irrespective of phytoremediation plant species, bacterial communities in the treatment containing plant species and hydrocarbon (T2) and one containing plant species, hydrocarbon, and manure (T4) clustered separately from one with plant species only (T1) as well as one with plant species and manure (T3) (
