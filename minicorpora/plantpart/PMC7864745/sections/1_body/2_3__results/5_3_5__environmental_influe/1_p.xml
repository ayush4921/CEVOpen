<p>Brayâ€“Curtis distance nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) revealed differences in composition of bacterial communities between hydrocarbon and nonhydrocarbon treatments. In two hydrocarbon-contaminated treatments, one was with plant species and hydrocarbon (T2) and the other with plant species, hydrocarbon, and manure (T4), where bacterial communities clustered in groups (see the ring in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This was different from nonhydrocarbon treatments: one with plant species only (T1) and the other with plant species and manure (T3) where bacterial communities were scattered (
