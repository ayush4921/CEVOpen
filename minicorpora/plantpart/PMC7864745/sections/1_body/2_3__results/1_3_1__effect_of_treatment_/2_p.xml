<p>PERMANOVA analysis showed cattle manure and hydrocarbon contamination significantly affected rhizobacteria community but not plant species (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The interaction of plant species and cattle manure explained 5.1% of ASVs variation in community structure. Similarly, interaction of plant species and hydrocarbon accounted for 9.2% of variation in ASVs. Biostimulation of plant species for bioremediation of TPH contaminated soil with cattle manure explained 13.4 % variation in assemblages of bacterial communities (
