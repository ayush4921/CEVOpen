<p>A total of 5 million high-quality paired-end reads were generated from Illumina MiSeq platform with an average of 83,333 reads per sample (
 <italic>n</italic> = 60). The tags were obtained with a maximum of 81,480 filtered sequences clustered to 3927 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) of sixty samples at 3% confidence interval. Rarefaction was conducted to approximate the number of ASVs in random samples. The rarefaction curves (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) asymptotically approached a plateau, suggesting that the curves accurately reflected microbial community richness and indicated that the sequencing efforts were sufficient for this study.
