<p>Assimilation is a complex biological oxidation process enhanced by supplementation with fixed nitrogen, phosphate, and other nutrients [
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. For example, one of the enzymes, oxidoreductases, enables oxidative coupling to take place enabling both phyla to extract energy via energy-yielding biochemical reactions which cleaves chemical bonds, assisting transfer of electrons from a reduced organic substrate (donor) to another chemical compound (acceptor). In this process, contaminants are finally oxidized to harmless compounds. This guarantees survival of the bacteria communities in a less toxic environment. Furthermore, oxidoreductases catalyze humification of various phenolic substances in soil environment through polymerization and copolymerization with other substrates [
