<p>There were significant variations (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.000) between rhizobacterial communities of phytoremediation species with and without hydrocarbon contamination. In the treatments with plant species alone (T1), high bacterial diversity was noted. However, when hydrocarbons were introduced (T2), there was a great reduction in diversity. The bacterial community shifts and eventual decrease in richness resulted from perturbations that normally occur in hydrocarbon contaminated soil. Past studies [
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] have proved that introduction of PHC in soil reduces bacterial diversity considerably regardless of the soil matrix type. Nevertheless, in this study, certain bacterial strains resilient to toxicity of PHC existed. These must have used TPH as a source of energy, carbon, or electron receptors for growth. As reported earlier, across all plant species, bacteria genera 
 <italic>Luteimonas, Pseudomonas</italic>, and 
 <italic>Sphingomonas</italic> (phylum Proteobacteria)
 <italic>, Mycobacteria</italic> and 
 <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> (phylum Actinobacteria) and genera 
 <italic>Bacillus</italic> and 
 <italic>Fusibacter</italic> (phylum Firmicutes) were abundant in the treatment with plant and hydrocarbon (T2) and one with plant species, hydrocarbon, and cattle manure (T4).
