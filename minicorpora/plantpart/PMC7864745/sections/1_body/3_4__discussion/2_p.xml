<p>Similarly, bacterial communities in hydrocarbon-contaminated soil were significantly affected by biostimulation with cattle manure (T4). The inclusion of cattle manure posted both direct and indirect benefits for the survival of bacterial communities. Directly, cattle manure amendments improved soil physicochemical characteristics enabling speedy adaptation by microorganisms. Furthermore, the introduction of cattle manure must have increased on soil fertility by adding soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), and NPK. This must have improved plant resilience and performance in the PHC contaminated soil. Accumulation of soil organic carbon for example not only results in increased microbial biomass but also affects microbial community structure and functional diversity [

Cattle manure additions also improved soil pH and physical properties (aggregation and porosity), thus creating favorable growth conditions for microbes. Earlier studies [
