<p>Addition of cattle manure to treatments with TPH increased clustering of taxa. Biostimulation with cattle manure boosted growth performance of the rhizosphere of phytoremediation plant species. The associated exudates were colonized by taxa leading to increased clustering as observed in treatments with plant species and hydrocarbon (T2) and plant species, hydrocarbon, and cattle manure (T4) (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This concurs with Praeg [
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] that rhizosphere zones of plants are hotspots for microbial growth, abundance and diversity due to nutrient availability.
