<p>Results from NMDS and PCA showed clustering of bacteria in hydrocarbon contaminated soil with plant species (T2) and one biostimulated by manure (T4), while in nonhydrocarbon contaminated soil with plant species only (T1) and one with plant species and manure (T3), the communities of bacteria were scattered from each other. The clustering could be associated with catabolic potential of dominant bacteria phyla established by this study. Although Sutton [
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] reasoned that regardless of soil matrix type, clean samples (nonhydrocarbon contaminated) have higher diversity than contaminated soil, results of this study showed more diversity and clustering in hydrocarbon contaminated treatments compared to those without. The clustering must have occurred due to the ability of the treatments with TPH to selectively stimulate bacterial propagation especially through addition of carbon (mixture of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons) that enriches taxa by serving as growth substrates [

The metabolic capacities of taxa therefore enabled biotransformation of various organic compounds by breaking down their bigger molecules into smaller units either by oxidation to release energy or complete utilization in other anabolic reactions. The versatility of taxa to use both saturated aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons played key role in enhancing survival and, consequently, removal of heterogeneous toxic contamination. This scenario has been observed in past studies. For example, Peng and colleagues [
