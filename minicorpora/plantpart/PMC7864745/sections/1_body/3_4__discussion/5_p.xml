<p>The three phyla are also known for secreting oxygenases. In the test samples, oxygenases both monooxygenases and dioxygenases could have been secreted by the phyla. Monooxygenases catalyze desulfurization, dehalogenation, denitrification, ammonification, hydroxylation, biotransformation, and biodegradation of various aromatic and aliphatic compounds, while dioxygenases introduce molecular oxygen into their substrate [

Therefore, both processes must have aided transformation of aromatic precursors into aliphatic products that are less toxic, creating better living environmental conditions. Furthermore, Protobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes are known for secreting lacasses [
