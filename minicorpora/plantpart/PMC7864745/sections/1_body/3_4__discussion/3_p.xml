 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Phyla Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes dominated the treatment with hydrocarbon contaminated soil and plant species (T2) and treatment T4 with plant species and manure treated hydrocarbon contaminated soil (T4). These phyla contain members of organotrophic microorganisms that utilize a wide range of organic substrates perhaps including hydrocarbon. Although bacterial strains survive best in aerobic conditions, the three phyla also thrive well in anaerobic environments. Their survival in anaerobic conditions is guaranteed by secretion of intracellular and extracellular enzymes which help in biodegradation of recalcitrant and organopollutants. These bacteria have enzymes capable of assimilating, degrading, and utilizing different hydrocarbon constituents as sources of carbon and energy [
