<p>In this study, polypropylene plastic-made pots were used. The soil was apportioned into 5â€‰kg pots. To ensure that soil, cattle manure, and crude oil are mixed thoroughly, a metallic sheet was used as a mixing base. The mixture was returned into the pots with perforated bases to allow aeration. Each pot was labeled with the name of the respective treatment. The labeled pots were left for one week before planting. To cater for any PHC losses, pots were placed on their lids. Any water leachate was used to irrigate the respective pot. The lids were also washed after every two days and the wash water used to irrigate respective pots.</p>
