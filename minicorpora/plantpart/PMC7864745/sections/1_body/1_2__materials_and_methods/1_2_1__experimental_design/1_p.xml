<p>A screen house pot experiment was conducted at Makerere University Agricultural Research Institute, Kabanyolo (MUARIK), from January 2018 to April 2018 (120 days). The soil used in the experiment was collected from nonhydrocarbon contaminated natural undisturbed land in the Sudd region as composite topsoil samples at a depth of 0–30 cm. Treatments included two rates of partially decomposed (1.7 : 0.6 : 0.8 NPK) cattle manure, two rates of crude oil, and five phytoremediation plant species arranged in Completely Randomised Design (CRD). Cattle manure was applied at rates of 0 and 5 g·kg
 <sup>−1</sup> soil confirmed as economically appropriate [

 <sup>−1</sup> soil were used. The phytoremediation plant species were (i) wild cotton (

 <italic>Sorghum arundinaceum</italic>), (iii) wild rice (
 <italic>Oryza longistaminata</italic>), (iv) false sunflower (
 <italic>Tithonia diversifolia</italic>), and (v) thatching grass (
 <italic>Hyparrhenia rufa</italic>). These plant species are abundant in the Sudd region [
