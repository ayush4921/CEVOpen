<p>Before merging, core sample inference algorithm was applied to data [
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The forward and reverse reads were then merged together to obtain full denoised sequences with function “
 <italic>mergePairs</italic>.” As defaults in DADA2, merged sequences were only output if forward and reverse reads overlapped with a minimum of 12 bases. The merged sequences were then rearranged in an Amplicon Sequence Variant (ASV) table [
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and cleaned for chimeras with functions “
 <italic>makeSequenceTable</italic>” and “
 <italic>removeBimeraDenovo,</italic>” respectively. For taxonomic classification, recommendations of Callahan and colleagues were used [
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], together with a native implementation of Naïve Bayesian classifier method [
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] using function “
 <italic>assignTaxonomy</italic>” still in DADA2 package. The ASVs with chimeras were removed from analysis using “
 <italic>subset</italic>_
 <italic>taxa</italic>” function in “
 <italic>Phyloseq</italic>” package (
