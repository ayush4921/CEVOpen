<p>After sequencing, demultiplexing of all libraries for each sequencing lane was done using Illumina bcl2fastq 2.17.1.14 software (folder RAW). One to two mismatches were allowed in the barcode and read when the barcode distances between all libraries on the lane allowed for it. The sorting of reads by amplicon inline barcodes (folder RAW) was done through one mismatch that was allowed per barcode. The barcode sequence was then clipped from the sequence after sorting and reads with missing barcodes, one-sided barcodes, or conflicting barcode pairs were discarded.</p>
