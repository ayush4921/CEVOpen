<p>Clipping of sequencing adapter remnants from all reads (folder AdapterClipped) was carried out and reads with final length &lt; 100 bases were discarded. The primer detection and clipping (folder Primer Clipped) was done by allowing three mismatches per primer; pairs of primers (Fw-Rev or Rev-Fw) were present in the sequence fragments. Whenever primer-dimers were detected, the outer primer copies were clipped from the sequence. The sequence fragments were turned into forward-reverse primer orientation after removing primer sequences.</p>
