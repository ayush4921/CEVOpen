<p>The concentrations used for PCR were as follows: total mixture, 25 
 <italic>µ</italic>l; dNTPs, 50 
 <italic>µ</italic>M; genomic DNA, 30 ng/
 <italic>µ</italic>l; and each primer, 10 pmol/
 <italic>µ</italic>l. The concentration of MgCl
 <sub>2</sub> in the reaction mixture was maintained at 1.5 mM for effective amplification. MgCl
 <sub>2</sub> was a cofactor for Taq enzyme and helped in adding correct dNTPs complementary to the sequence in newly synthesizing strand by binding to dNTPs. A second PCR reaction was performed using 5 ml of the first PCR products as template under the same primers (GC clamp attached to the primer U968f) and conditions specified for the first PCR reaction. The PCR reactions were performed in duplicate, in order to obtain adequate DNA amount for electrophoresis. Amplification products were checked in 1.3% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide (0.1 mg/ml). This was followed by storage at −20°C and then sending to the LGC Genomics Sequencing Centre in Germany. Purified PCR products were pyrosequenced using Illumina MiSeq by the LGC Genomics Sequencing Centre in Germany (
