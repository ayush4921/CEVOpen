<p>Genomic DNA was extracted from 0.25 g of the rhizosphere soil sample using DNeasy Power Soil® DNA Isolation Kit (Qiagen Company) following the manufacturer's instructions. Bacterial diversity was analysed using culture independent molecular technique16S rRNA gene PCR. The primers used in PCR reactions were 341F and 785R. A GC clamp was added to forward primer (F). These targeted approximately 300 bp of hypervariable V3 region. All PCR amplifications were performed using ThermoHybaid PCR cycler (Molecular Biology Instrumentation, Massachusetts, USA). PCR mixtures were prepared with 5 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of Taq buffer 10×, 2.5 mM of MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>mol of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP), 20 pmol each primer, 5 
 <italic>μ</italic>g of bovine serum albumin, 1% of formamide and 2.5U Taq polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemical, Mannheim, Germany), and sterile filtered Milli-Q water to a final volume of 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>l. The PCR program was as follows: denaturing step of 94°C for 3 min, followed by 35 cycles of 1 min at 94°C, annealing for 1 min at 55°C, and elongation for 1 min at 72°C, followed by a final elongation at 72°C for 10 min.
