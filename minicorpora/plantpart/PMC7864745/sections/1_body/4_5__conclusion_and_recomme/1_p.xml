<p>Plant species growing in TPH contaminated soil are inhabited by various strains of rhizobacteria because their roots provide excellent living conditions. In this study, rhizobacteria genera 
 <italic>Bacillus, Fusibacter, Luteimonas, Mycobacterium, Pseudomonas Rhodococcus,</italic> and 
 <italic>Sphingomonas</italic> were abundant in rhizosphere of phytoremediation species. In the same vein, the study also established that addition of cattle manure enhanced multiplication of these genera. Therefore, it is concluded that, in order to achieve better bioremediation, TPH contaminated soils should be bio-stimulated with cattle manure to increase rhizobacteria richness. With the exception of 
 <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> (a genus that includes dangerous pathogens), this study recommends use of the genera listed above as an inoculum during ecorestoration of PHC contaminated soils in Sudd region, South Sudan. 
 <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> is a carrier of tuberculosis (TB) which is a common cause of death with a prevalence rate of 257 per 100,000 people in South Sudan.
