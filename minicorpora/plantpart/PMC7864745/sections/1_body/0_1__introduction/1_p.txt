1: The world greatly depends on oil and, as a result, vast amount is used, transported, and stored [ 1].
2: Crude oil is number one source of energy and a primary raw material for major industries worldwide [ 2].Oil remains an indispensable input for sectors such as manufacturing (as a raw material and fuel), transport (fuel), and trade (as an export commodity), and there has been a steady increase in global demand for crude oil over the last decades [ 2,  3,  4].
3: Over the next two decades, Rada and colleagues [ 5] anticipate that world oil demand could even rise to 170 million barrels per day.
4: This belief has compelled producing countries to devise ways and means of increasing production, transportation, and refining of crude oil in order to meet the purported growth in demand [ 2,  4], South Sudan inclusive [ 6].
