<p>Bioremediation-based rhizoremediation is a biological technology with great potential of restoring PHC contaminated soils [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Rhizoremediation refers to a process in which the PHC contaminants are degraded by bacteria in the rhizosphere [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and uses a suite of indigenous microorganisms [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. This approach is nondestructive and is environmentally acceptable [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] making it a desirable and sustainable technique [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. For example, it does not generate toxic metabolites [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Relatedly, Shukla and colleagues [32] contend that the mechanism provides a natural corrective solution in which the synergy between roots of phytoremediation species and resident plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) boosts secretion of root exudates, production of siderophores, phytohormones, and phosphatases. This accounts for why the approach is regarded an effective natural remedy for ecorestoration of polluted sites [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] leading to its popularity as a green technology as reported elsewhere [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].
