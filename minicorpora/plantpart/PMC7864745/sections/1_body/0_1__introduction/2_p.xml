<p>South Sudan is one of the famous crude oil producing countries falling 3
 <sup>rd</sup> after Nigeria and Angola in Africa [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and 83
 <sup>rd</sup> among the 171 oil producing countries worldwide [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Oil is the lifeline of its economy for now and over the medium term [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. For example, between 2008 and 2011, oil exports accounted for 98% of government revenue [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This position has fundamentally changed her economy from agriculture to industrialization. South Sudan has a production capacity of 298,000/390,000 barrels per day [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] including Sudd wetland. Sudd is the largest wetland in the whole world and covers 57,000 Km
 <sup>2</sup> that makes up approximately 5% of the total land area of the Republic of South Sudan (648,000 Km
 <sup>2</sup>) [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The area of the wetland is larger than countries such as Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Singapore [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Owing to this enormous size, the Sudd ecosystems are of vast socioeconomic, cultural, and biological importance locally, nationally, and internationally. This accounts for why it was designated as a Ramsar site in 2006 [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] making it an essential nature conservation area.
