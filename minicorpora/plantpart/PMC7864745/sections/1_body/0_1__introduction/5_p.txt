0: Attempts to remediate hydrocarbon-contaminated soil are a priority in national development plans of many oil-producing countries in order to counteract the harmful effects of PHC [ 23,  24].
1: South Sudan is not exceptional.
2: The techniques deployed in remediation of PHC polluted soil are fivefold: chemical, physical, electrical, thermal, and biological [ 25,  26].
3: The use of chemical treatment involves chemical precipitation, membrane separation, ion exchange, carbon absorption, aqueous chemical oxidation, and surfactant enhanced recovery [ 25].
4: With regard to physical treatment, the main treatment measures involve land filling, pumping and treating, dual phase extraction as well as air sparging, and dual phase extraction [ 25,  26].
5: For electrical remediation, electrical principles are applied to decontaminate particular sites though only limited to granular type of soil contaminated with heavy metals [ 25].
6: The thermal methods are largely used in environments where the contaminants are highly volatile and include  in situ vitrification, incineration, and electrical pyrolysis.
7: However, the above-mentioned techniques are not largely used at present because they are associated with various shortcomings such as high cost, handling of the generated excess waste, and secondary contamination [ 25,  26].
8: This has given way to biological remediation techniques.
9: It is not by surprise therefore that in recent times, in most crude oil producing countries, biological remediation techniques are dominating any efforts for ecorestoration of PHC contaminated soils [ 27], bioremediation inclusive [ 25].
