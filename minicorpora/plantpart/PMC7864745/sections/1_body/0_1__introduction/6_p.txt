0: Bioremediation-based rhizoremediation is a biological technology with great potential of restoring PHC contaminated soils [ 28,  29].
1: Rhizoremediation refers to a process in which the PHC contaminants are degraded by bacteria in the rhizosphere [ 23,  24] and uses a suite of indigenous microorganisms [ 30].
2: This approach is nondestructive and is environmentally acceptable [ 28,  29,  31] making it a desirable and sustainable technique [ 31].
3: For example, it does not generate toxic metabolites [ 29].
4: Relatedly, Shukla and colleagues [32] contend that the mechanism provides a natural corrective solution in which the synergy between roots of phytoremediation species and resident plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) boosts secretion of root exudates, production of siderophores, phytohormones, and phosphatases.
5: This accounts for why the approach is regarded an effective natural remedy for ecorestoration of polluted sites [ 32] leading to its popularity as a green technology as reported elsewhere [ 33 35].
