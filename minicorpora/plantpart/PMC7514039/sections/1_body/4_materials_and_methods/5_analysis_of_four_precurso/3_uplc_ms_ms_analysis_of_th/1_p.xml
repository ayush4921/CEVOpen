<p>Chromatographic grade acetonitrile and methanol were purchased from Fisher (USA). Standard solutions of all metabolites were prepared by dissolving precisely weighed samples in a precise volume of methanol. The detection of the metabolites was performed using an ultra-performance liquid chromatography system (Waters Acquity UPLC) coupled with a quadrupole mass spectrometers (Waters Xevo TQ) equipped with an ESI source. Calibration curves, method validation, linearity, accuracy and precision, extraction recovery, stability etc., were performed as previously described by Zhang et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0237952.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] with some modifications. The chromatographic separations of shikimic acid and phenylalanine were carried out over an HSS T3 Column 2.1×100 (mm, id, particle size 1.8 μm) using an isocratic elution mode. The mobile phase consisted of 25% acetonitrile (containing 0.25‰ formic acid) and 75% water (containing 0.25‰ formic acid). The detection was performed in negative modes. The capillary voltage was 2.8 kV with desolvation temperature at 450°C. The chromatographic separations of cinnamic acid and 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid were carried out over an HSS T3 Column 2.1×100 (mm, id, particle size 1.8 μm) and eluted using an isocratic mobile phase consisted of 15% acetonitrile (containing 0.25‰ formic acid) and 85% water (containing 0.25‰ formic acid). The detection was performed in positive ion mode and the capillary and voltage (ESI) was 3.0 kV with desolvation temperature 450°C. The precursor-product ion pairs, fragmentor voltage (Frag) and collision energy (CE) for the analytes were as follows: 93.01/ 93.0193.0 m/z Frag 22 V; CE 12 V, 8 V for shikimic acid, 93.01/93.0193.01.01 m/z Frag 26 V; CE 14 V, 12 V for phenylalanine, 103.04/131.04 m/z Frag 18 V; CE 20 V, 10 V for cinnamic acid, m/z 93.00/3119.33 Frag 22 V; CE 24 V, 28 V for 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid. Dwell times of shikimic acid, phenylalanine, cinnamic acid and 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid were all 16 ms. The flow rate of analyses was 0.5 mL min
 <sup>-1</sup>. The column temperature was maintained at 35°C and the injection volume was 2 μL. The data were analyzed using the Masslynx software.
