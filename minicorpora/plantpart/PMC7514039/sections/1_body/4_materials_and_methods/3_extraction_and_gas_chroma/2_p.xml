<p>Compound identification was done by comparing the obtained peaks with NIST library reference of mass spectral library. The compounds with &gt; 85% similarity to NIST mass spectral library were kept. Relative percentage composition of the compounds was computed from gas chromatography peak areas with DB-5ms column without applying correction factors [
