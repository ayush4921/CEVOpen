<p>We further analyzed the composition of the esssential oils obtained from the four treatments. According to the GC-MS analysis, essential oil of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>heterotropoides</italic> var. 
 <italic>mandshuricum</italic> was composed of phenylpropanoid compounds, aromatic compounds and terpenoids compounds. The gas chromatogram results of phenylpropanoid and aromatic compounds detected in the four essential oils are displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0237952.g004">Fig 4</xref>. Only compounds with at least 85% similarity to NIST mass spectral library were selected. We identified 50, 50, 41 and 44 compounds in essential oils from plants grown in 100, 50, 24 and 12% full sunlight, respectively (
