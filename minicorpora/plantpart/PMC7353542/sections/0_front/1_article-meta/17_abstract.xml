 <p>The use of chemical insecticides has had several side-effects, such as environmental contamination, foodborne residues, and human health threats. The utilization of plant-derived essential oils as efficient bio-rational agents has been acknowledged in pest management strategies. In the present study, the fumigant toxicity of essential oil isolated from 
  <italic>Satureja intermedia</italic> was assessed against cosmopolitan stored-product insect pests: 
  <italic>Trogoderma granarium</italic> Everts (khapra beetle), 
  <italic>Rhyzopertha dominica</italic> (Fabricius) (lesser grain borer), 
  <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> (Herbst) (red flour beetle), and 
  <italic>Oryzaephilus surinamensis</italic> (L.) (saw-toothed grain beetle). The essential oil had significant fumigant toxicity against tested insects, which positively depended on essential oil concentrations and the exposure times. Comparative contact toxicity of 
  <italic>S. intermedia</italic> essential oil was measured against 
  <italic>Aphis nerii</italic> Boyer de Fonscolombe (oleander aphid) and its predator 
  <italic>Coccinella septempunctata</italic> L. (seven-spot ladybird). Adult females of 
  <italic>A. nerii</italic> were more susceptible to the contact toxicity than the 
  <italic>C. septempunctata</italic> adults. The dominant compounds in the essential oil of 
  <italic>S. intermedia</italic> were thymol (48.1%), carvacrol (11.8%), 
  <italic>p</italic>-cymene (8.1%), and Î³-terpinene (8.1%). The high fumigant toxicity against four major stored-product insect pests, the significant aphidicidal effect on 
  <italic>A. nerii</italic>, and relative safety to the general predator 
  <italic>C. septempunctata</italic> make terpene-rich 
  <italic>S. intermedia</italic> essential oil a potential candidate for use as a plant-based alternative to the detrimental synthetic insecticides.
