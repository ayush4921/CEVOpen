<p>According to 
 <xref rid="foods-09-00712-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, an obvious difference in the mean mortality percentage of all tested storage insect pests was detected, as essential oil concentration and exposure time were increased. For example, 25.00% mortality of 
 <italic>O. surinamensis</italic> adults was observed at 4.71 µL/L and 24-h exposure time, which had increased to 80.00% and 100% at 14.71 µL/L after 24 and 72 h, respectively. It is apparent that the essential oil of 
 <italic>S. intermedia</italic> gave at least 90% mortality against all tested stored-product insect pests at 58.82 µL/L after 72 h (
