<p>The tested concentrations of 
 <italic>S. intermedia</italic> essential oil demonstrated significant contact toxicity on both 
 <italic>A. nerii</italic> (
 <italic>F</italic> = 27.682, df = 4, 15; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) and 
 <italic>C. septempunctata</italic> (
 <italic>F</italic> = 35.607, df = 4, 15; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). A positive correlation between essential oil concentrations and the mortality of 
 <italic>A. nerii</italic> and 
 <italic>C. septempunctata</italic> in the contact assay is also apparent, based on the high 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> values (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-09-00712-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Comparisons of the mean mortality percentage of 
 <italic>A. nerii</italic> and its predator 
 <italic>C. septempunctata</italic> caused by 
 <italic>S. intermedia</italic> essential oil are shown in 
 <xref rid="foods-09-00712-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. The mortality percentages of both insects increased with increasing essential oil concentrations, but their susceptibility to the essential oil was noticeably different. For example, 62.50% mortality was documented for 
 <italic>A. nerii</italic> at 500 Âµg/mL essential oil concentration while its predator 
 <italic>C. septempunctata</italic> was more tolerant and exhibited only 17.50% mortality at this concentration (
