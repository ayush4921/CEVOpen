<p>The terpenes, especially thymol, carvacrol, 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene and γ-terpinene, were recognized as the main components of 
 <italic>S. intermedia</italic> essential oil in the present study. In the study of Sefidkon and Jamzad, thymol (32.3%), γ-terpinene (29.3%), 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (14.7%), elemicin (4.8%), limonene (3.3%), and α-terpinene (3.3%) were the main components of 
 <italic>S. intermedia</italic> essential oil [
 <xref rid="B20-foods-09-00712" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In another study, thymol (34.5%), γ-terpinene (18.2%), 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (10.5%), limonene (7.3%), α-terpinene (7.1%), carvacrol (6.9%), and elemicin (5.3%) were found to be major components in the essential oil of 
 <italic>S. intermedia</italic> [
 <xref rid="B23-foods-09-00712" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In the present study, however, limonene was a minor component (0.5%), and neither elemicin nor α-terpinene were detected. Ghorbanpour et al. reported the terpenes thymol (32.3%), 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (14.7%), γ-terpinene (3.3%), and carvacrol (1.0%), and the phenylpropanoid elemicin (4.8%) as the main components in the essential oil of 
 <italic>S. intermedia</italic> [
 <xref rid="B22-foods-09-00712" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], while the concentrations of γ-terpinene and carvacrol were much lower compared to the present findings. The differences in the chemical profile of the plant essential oils are likely due to the internal and external factors such as seasonal variation, geographical features, plant growth stage, and different extraction conditions [

 <italic>S. intermedia</italic> essential oil in the present study, have been documented in recent investigations. For example, insecticidal activities of 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene, α-pinene, γ-terpinene, 1,8-cineole, and limonene have been demonstrated against several detrimental insect pests [

 <xref rid="B50-foods-09-00712" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Previous studies have also indicated that the monoterpenoids thymol and carvacrol had significant toxicity against insect pests [

 <xref rid="B51-foods-09-00712" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,
 <xref rid="B52-foods-09-00712" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Accordingly, the insecticidal efficiency of 
 <italic>S. intermedia</italic> essential oil can be attributed to such components.
