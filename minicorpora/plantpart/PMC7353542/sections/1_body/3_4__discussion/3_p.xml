<p>The contact toxicity of the essential oil of 
 <italic>Eucalyptus globulus</italic> Labill. against 
 <italic>A. nerii</italic> has been reported by Russo et al. [
 <xref rid="B53-foods-09-00712" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Although this is the only previous study to investigate the susceptibility of 
 <italic>A. nerii</italic> to a plant essential oil, its findings confirm the results of the present study about the possibility of 
 <italic>A. nerii</italic> management through plant essential oils. Indeed, the toxicity of 
 <italic>S. intermedia</italic> essential oil was evaluated for the first time in the present study against 
 <italic>A. nerii</italic> and its natural enemy 
 <italic>C. septempunctata</italic>. The essential oil of 
 <italic>S. intermedia</italic> was more toxic on 
 <italic>A. nerii</italic> (LC
 <sub>50</sub>: 418 µg/mL) than the predator ladybird 
 <italic>C. septempunctata</italic> (LC
 <sub>50</sub>: 914 µg/mL), suggesting that the predator was more tolerant than the aphid to 
 <italic>S. intermedia</italic> essential oil, which is very valuable in terms of predator protection. Similar results were obtained for controlling aphids [

 <xref rid="B61-foods-09-00712" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Therefore, it is important to select efficient pesticides with lower side effects on natural enemies at operative concentrations to the pests, which has been achieved in the current study.
