<p>In conclusion, the terpene-rich essential oil of 
 <italic>S. intermedia</italic> has significant fumigant toxicity against the adults of 
 <italic>O. surinamensis</italic>, 
 <italic>R. dominica</italic>, 
 <italic>T. castaneum</italic>, and 
 <italic>T. granarium</italic>, and may be considered as a natural effective fumigant on stored products. This bio-rational agent also has significant contact toxicity on the adult females of 
 <italic>A. nerii</italic>, one of the cosmopolitan insect pests of ornamental plants. Furthermore, the predator ladybird 
 <italic>C. septempunctata</italic> was more tolerant to the essential oil than the aphid. Accordingly, 
 <italic>S. intermedia</italic> essential oil can be nominated as an eco-friendly efficient insecticide by decreasing the risks associated with the application of synthetic chemicals. However, the exploration of any side-effects of the essential oil on other useful insects such as parasitoids and pollinators, its phytotoxicity on the treated plants and crops, any adverse tastes or odors on stored products, and the preparation of novel formulations to increase its stability in the environment for practical utilization are needed.
