<p>The chemical profile of the 
 <italic>S. intermedia</italic> essential oil was evaluated using gas chromatography (Agilent 7890B) coupled with mass-spectrometer (Agilent 5977A). The analysis was carried out by a HP-5 ms capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 µm). The temperature of the injector was 280 °C and the column temperature adjusted from 50 to 280 °C using the temperature program: 50 °C (hold for 1 min), increase to 100 °C at 8°/min, increase to 185 °C at 5°/min, increase to 280 °C at 15°/min, and hold at 280 °C for 2 min. The carrier gas was helium (99.999%) with flow rate of 1 mL/min. Essential oil was diluted in methanol, and 1 µL solution was injected (split 1:10 at 0.75 min). The identification of components was performed by comparing mass spectral fragmentation patterns and retention indices with those reported in the databases [
