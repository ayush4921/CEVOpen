<p>The contact toxicity of 
 <italic>S. intermedia</italic> essential oil against the apterous adult females of 
 <italic>A. nerii</italic> and unsexed adults of 
 <italic>C. septempunctata</italic> was tested through filter paper discs (Whatman No. 1), 9 cm diameter, positioned in glass petri dishes (90 × 10 mm). Range-finding experiments were established to find the proper concentrations for each insect. Concentrations ranging from 200 to 750 µg/mL for 
 <italic>A. nerii</italic> and from 500 to 1400 µg/mL for 
 <italic>C. septempunctata</italic> were prepared via 1.00% aqueous Tween-80 as an emulsifying agent. Each solution (200 µL) was applied to the surface of the filter paper. Ten insects were separately released onto each treated disc, the dishes sealed with Parafilm
 <sup>®</sup> and kept at 25 ± 2 °C, 65 ± 5% relative humidity and a photoperiod of 16:8 h (light:dark). Except for the addition of essential oil concentrations, all other procedures were unchanged for the control groups. Four replications were made for each treatment and mortality was documented after 24 h. Aphids and ladybirds were considered dead if no leg or antennal movements were detected when softly prodded [
