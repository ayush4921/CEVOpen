 <italic>Trogoderma granarium</italic> adults were collected from infested stored wheat grains in Moghan region (Ardabil province, Iran). Insects were identified by Asgar Ebadollahi. Fifty unsexed pairs of adult insects were separately released onto wheat grains and removed from breeding container after 48 h. Wheat grains contaminated with insect eggs were separately kept in an incubator at 25 ± 2 °C, 65 ± 5% relative humidity and a photoperiod of 14:10 (L:D) h. Finally, one to fourteen-day-old adults of 
 <italic>O. surinamensis</italic>, 
 <italic>R. dominica</italic>,
