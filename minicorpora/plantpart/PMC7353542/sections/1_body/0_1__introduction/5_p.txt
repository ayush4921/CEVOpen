0: Sixteen species of the  Satureja genus from the Lamiaceae have been reported in the Iranian flora, of which  S. atropatana Bunge,  S. bachtiarica Bunge,  S. edmondi Briquet,  S. intermedia C. A. Mey,  S. isophylla Rech.,  S. kallarica Jamzad,  S. khuzistanica Jamzad,  S. macrosiphonia Bornm.,  S. sahendica Bornm., and  S. rechingeri Jamzad are endemic to Iran [ 19].
1: S. intermedia, as a small delicate perennial plant growing on rock outcrops, is among aromatic plants with considerable amount (1.45% ( w/w)) of essential oil [ 20].
2: The essential oil of  S. intermedia is rich in terpenes such as 1,8-cineole,  p-cymene, limonene, -terpinene, -terpinene, thymol, and -caryophyllene, which are classified in four main groups; monoterpene hydrocarbons, oxygenated monoterpenoids, sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, and oxygenated sesquiterpenoids [ 20, 21, 22].
3: Some important biological effects of  S. intermedia essential oil include antifungal, antibacterial, and antioxidant effects, and cytotoxic effects have been reported in previous studies [ 21, 22, 23].
4: Although the susceptibility of insect pests to the essential oils isolated from some  Satureja species such as  S. hortensis,  S. montana L.,  S. parnassica Heldr.
5: & Sart ex Boiss.,  S. spinosa L., and  S. thymbra L. was documented in recent years [ 24, 25, 26], the insecticidal effects of  S. intermedia essential oil have not reported yet.
