<p>As part of a screening program for eco-friendly and efficient plant-derived insecticides, the evaluation of the fumigant toxicity against four major Coleopteran stored-product insect pests 
 <italic>O. surinamensis</italic>, 
 <italic>R. dominica</italic>, 
 <italic>T. castaneum</italic> and 
 <italic>T. granarium</italic> and the contact toxicity against a greenhouse insect pest 
 <italic>Aphis nerii</italic> of the essential oil of 
 <italic>S. intermedia</italic> was the main objective of the present study. Because of the importance of studying the effects of insecticides on the natural enemies of insect pests, the toxicity of 
 <italic>S. intermedia</italic> essential oil against 
 <italic>C. septempunctata</italic> was also investigated.
