<p>For the determination of phenolic compounds, after extraction with hexane, the plant material was dried and extracted with 60% ethanol (3 × 3 mL) in an ultrasonic bath (3 × 15 min). The extracts were combined in volumetric flasks (10 mL) and made up to the mark with 60% ethanol. Prior to the HPLC analysis, the extracts were filtered through 0.22 µm nylon filters. Acidic hydrolysis of the extract was performed to determine the presence of flavonoid aglycones. A volume of 0.4 mL of 1.0 mol/L hydrochloric acid was added to 5 mL of the extract and the mixture was made up to 10 mL with methanol in a volumetric flask. Hydrolysis was conducted for 2 h at 40 °C. Before the analysis, the extract was neutralized with NH
