<p>The cypselae were dried, pulverized and accurately weighted (1.000 g). Samples were extracted four times with hexane (4 × 30 mL) using an ultrasonic bath (4 × 15 min.) The extracts were combined and evaporated in a rotary evaporator. Accurately weighed oil (approx. 100 mg) was transferred into a volumetric flask (5 mL) and dissolved in 2-propanol. The solution was filtered through a 0.25 µm polyamide membrane filter before the HPLC analysis. Accurately weighed oil (approx. 10 ± 2 mg) was dissolved in 500 μL TBME and derivatized by the addition of 250 μL TMSH. The whole sample was shaken vigorously and the GC analysis was performed.</p>
