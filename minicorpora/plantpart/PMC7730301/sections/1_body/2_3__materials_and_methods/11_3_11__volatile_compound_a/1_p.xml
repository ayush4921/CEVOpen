<p>The analyses of the 
 <italic>C. acaulis</italic> cypselae were performed on a whole embryo with the husk (=cypsela), husk, and a peeled and ground embryo. Extraction was carried out using 50/30 µm DVB/CAR/PDMS SPME fiber (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA). 2-undecanone (Merck, Poland) was used as an internal standard—1.0 or 0.2 mg/mL of water for the seeds and husk, respectively. A sample containing 100 mg of cypselae and the embryo or 50 mg of husk was placed in a 4 mL vial capped with an aluminum cap. Equilibration was performed at 60 °C for 30 min. The fiber exposition time was 15 min, and thermal desorption was carried out for 3 min at 250 °C directly in the GC injection port. All analyses were performed in triplicate.
