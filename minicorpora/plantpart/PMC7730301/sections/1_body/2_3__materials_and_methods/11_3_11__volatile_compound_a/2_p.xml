<p>The analysis was performed using an Agilent 7890B GC coupled with the 7000GC/TQ system (Agilent Technologies, Paolo Alto, CA, USA). Separation was carried out on an HP-5 MS column; 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 µm (J&amp;W, Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) at a constant helium flow of 1 mL/min. The injector temperature was set at 250 °C and the sample was applied in a split mode (20:1). The temperature program was 50 °C for 1 min, followed by 4 °C/min to 130 °C, 10 °C/min to 280 °C, and held isothermal for 2 min. The MS source was set at 230 °C, the transfer line was 320 °C, and the quadrupole temperature was 150 °C. The electron ionization energy was set at 70 eV, scan range, m/z 30–400.</p>
