<p>Determination of minerals was conducted according to the methodology published previously (Dresler et al., 2020). Pulverized cypselae (0.2000 g) were mineralized using 5 mL of the HNO

The resulting clear solutions were transferred into volumetric flasks and filled up to 25 mL with deionized water. The amounts of all elements were measured using ICP-OES PlasmaQuant PQ 9000 Elite (Analityk Jena AG, Jena, Germany). Effective plasma power was 1300 W and the plasma, auxiliary, and nebulizer argon flow rates were 14.0, 0.5, and 0.6 L/min, respectively. The attenuated radial direction of measurement for Ca, K, and Mg (analytical lines: 315.887, 766.491, and 285.213, respectively) and the axial direction for Cd, Zn, Mn, Fe, Mo, Cu, Co, Cr, Ni, Al, Pb, and As (analytical lines: 214.441, 206.200, 257.610, 259.940, 202.030, 2019.227, 228.615, 205.552, 231.604, 396.152, 220.353, and 188.970, respectively) were applied. Each sample was measured in three replicates.
