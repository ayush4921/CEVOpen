 <italic>v</italic>). The eluent flow rate was 1 mL/min. The column temperature was set to 25 °C. The injection volume was 1 μL. Data were collected between 190 and 400 nm. The quantitative analysis was performed at λ = 321 and 324 nm for neochlorogenic and chlorogenic acids, respectively. Each sample was measured in three replicates.
