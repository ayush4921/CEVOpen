<p>The analysis was performed on a VWR Hitachi Chromaster 600 chromatograph with a 5430 Diode Array Detector, a 5440 FL Detector, and EZChrom Elite software (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). An RP18e LiChrospher 100 column (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) (25 cm × 4.0 mm i.d., 5 µm particle size) was used for the analyses. The identity of compounds was established by comparison of retention times and PDA spectra with the corresponding standards.</p>
