 <italic>v</italic>). The eluent flow rate was 1.2 mL/min. The column temperature was set to 30 °C. The injection volume was 5 μL. The quantitative analysis was performed using a fluorescence detector with an excitation wavelength at 296 nm and an emission wavelength at 330 nm. Each sample was measured in three replicates.
