<p>The total chlorophyll and carotenoid contents were assessed with the method proposed by Wellburn [
 <xref rid="B52-ijms-21-09230" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The oil (50 mg) was mixed with 1 mL of isopropanol, vortexed for 5 min at 3000 rpm, and centrifuged at 6000 rpm. Spectrophotometric measurements were carried out at 470, 646, and 663 nm for carotene, chlorophyll b, and chlorophyll a, respectively. The DAD spectrum of the oil was recorded using a VWR Hitachi Chromaster 600 chromatograph with a 5430 Diode Array Detector and EZChrom Elite software (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). The ATR-IR spectroscopy analysis was performed according to the procedure published previously [
