<p>The cypselae were placed in a humid chamber for 2 h and later fixed in a mixture of 2.5% glutaraldehyde with 2.5% formaldehyde in 0.05 M cacodylate buffer (Sigma-Aldrich, Sigma-Aldrich Sp. z o.o. Poznan, Poland; pH 7.2). Next, they were washed three times in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, dehydrated in a graded ethanol series for 15 min at each concentration, and kept overnight in absolute ethanol. Subsequently, the samples were infiltrated for 1 h each in 3:1, 1:1, and 1:3 (

 <italic>v</italic>) mixtures of absolute ethanol and Technovit and then stored for 12 h in pure Technovit. The resin was polymerized by adding a hardener. The materials were cut into 5 μm thick sections using a rotary microtome, stained with 0.1% toluidine blue O, and mounted in DPX (Sigma-Aldrich, Sigma-Aldrich Sp. z o.o. Poznan, Poland). Selected Technovit sections were stained with NBB for total protein staining [

A part of the material was fixed in a 1% osmium tetroxide solution (in cacodylate buffer, Sigma-Aldrich, Sigma-Aldrich LLB, Poznan, Poland; pH 7.2) at room temperature for 1.5 h. Next, this material was embedded in Technovit 7100 (Kulzer, Germany) for further histological analysis.
