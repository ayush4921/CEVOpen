<p>Seeds of many plant species are a valuable source of various nutrients, e.g., oil, protein, carbohydrates, and biologically active secondary metabolites. Seed oils are rich in unsaturated fatty acids [
 <xref rid="B1-ijms-21-09230" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], which are highly important for human health, as they prevent the development of many diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes. They are also essential for the proper development of the fetus and cognitive functions [

Tocols (tocopherols and tocotrienols) present in oils, referred to as vitamin E, play important roles in the human organism, preventing oxidation of the components of the cell membrane, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and low-density lipoproteins [
