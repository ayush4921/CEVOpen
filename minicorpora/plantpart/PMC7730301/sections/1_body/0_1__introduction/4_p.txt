0: The aim of our study was to investigate the morphological and anatomical structure of  C. acaulis cypselae using such imaging techniques as light and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).
1: Moreover, the chemical composition of cypselae was evaluated taking into account the content of primary and secondary metabolites as well as the mineral profile.
2: The following techniques have been used: gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC-MS), HPLC with photodiode (DAD) and fluorescence (FLD) detection, ultra-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (UPLC-FLD), inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy (ATR-IR), and UV-VIS spectrophotometry.
3: To our knowledge, this is the first study on the cell structure and chemical composition of the  C. acaulis cypsela.
