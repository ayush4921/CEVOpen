1: The cypsela is a complex, indehiscent, dry, unilocular fruit with a single seed not adnate to the pericarp and derived from an inferior ovary [ 14].
2: The data in the literature indicate that cypselae of some Asteraceae species are rich in protein and oil (e.g., [ 15]), and immatured cypselae of some genera ( Taraxacum,  Hieracium,  Pilosella) contain large amounts of polysaccharides [ 16, 17, 18].
