 <italic>Carlina acaulis</italic> L. (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-09230-f001">Figure 1</xref>A) is a monocarpic perennial plant from the Asteraceae family occurring in South and Central Europe. 
 <italic>Carlina</italic> root has been used in medicine since ancient times mainly for treatment of skin diseases, in treatment of dental and gastrointestinal tract diseases, and as an anthelmintic and diuretic agent. Some reports also indicate the therapeutic potential of aerial parts in skin diseases [
 <xref rid="B7-ijms-21-09230" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-ijms-21-09230" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The chemical composition of the roots and green parts of 
 <italic>C. acaulis</italic> is quite well known and established mostly by chromatographic techniques: high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and gas chromatography (GC). For example, carlina oxide and inulin were found as the main phytochemicals in roots [
 <xref rid="B9-ijms-21-09230" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and leaves were shown to contain flavonoids [
 <xref rid="B10-ijms-21-09230" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], chlorogenic acids, and considerable amounts of oleanolic and ursolic acids [

 <xref rid="B12-ijms-21-09230" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In contrast, there are scarce reports on the phytochemistry of seeds. They are limited to one publication from 1969 [
 <xref rid="B13-ijms-21-09230" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], in which the fatty acid profile of 
 <italic>C. acaulis</italic> fruit oil was examined and only five fatty acids were identified and quantified.
