<p>The aim of our study was to investigate the morphological and anatomical structure of 
 <italic>C. acaulis</italic> cypselae using such imaging techniques as light and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Moreover, the chemical composition of cypselae was evaluated taking into account the content of primary and secondary metabolites as well as the mineral profile. The following techniques have been used: gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC-MS), HPLC with photodiode (DAD) and fluorescence (FLD) detection, ultra-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (UPLC-FLD), inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy (ATR-IR), and UV-VIS spectrophotometry. To our knowledge, this is the first study on the cell structure and chemical composition of the 
 <italic>C. acaulis</italic> cypsela.
