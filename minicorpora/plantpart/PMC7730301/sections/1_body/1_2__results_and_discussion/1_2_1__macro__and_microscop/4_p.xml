<p>We did not detect starch grains in the embryo cells of 
 <italic>Carlina acaulis</italic>; however, as shown by Jacobsen [
 <xref rid="B19-ijms-21-09230" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], the occurrence of starch grains in cotyledons depends on the species. In other species from the Asteraceae family starch was not found as storage material in embryos, e.g., in sunflower cultivars [
 <xref rid="B15-ijms-21-09230" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and 
 <italic>Trichocline catharinensis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B20-ijms-21-09230" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].
