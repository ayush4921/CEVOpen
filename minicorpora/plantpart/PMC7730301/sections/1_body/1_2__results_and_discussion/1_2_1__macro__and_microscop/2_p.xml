<p>As shown by the microscopic imaging, the mature cypsela (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-09230-f002">Figure 2</xref>A) was mostly occupied by a large embryo (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-09230-f002">Figure 2</xref>Bâ€“D), which was covered by the pericarp overlain by the testa (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-09230-f002">Figure 2</xref>E). In transverse section, the shape of the cypsela was mainly elliptical (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-09230-f002">Figure 2</xref>B). The embryo cells (cells of both the epidermis and parenchyma) were filled with storage materials in the form of approximately globular structures (
