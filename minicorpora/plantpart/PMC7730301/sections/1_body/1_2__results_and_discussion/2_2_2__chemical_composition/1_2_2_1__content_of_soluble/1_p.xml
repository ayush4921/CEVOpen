<p>The microscopic analysis revealed the presence of protein bodies, which prompted quantification of protein and free amino acids. The 
 <italic>C. acaulis</italic> cypsela was shown to contain 356.75 ± 30.45 and 3.38 ± 0.03 g/kg of soluble protein and free amino acids, respectively. Thus, the content of soluble protein in the 
 <italic>C. acaulis</italic> cypsela is comparable to that in soybeans (360 to 460 g/kg), which is one of the richest vegetable sources of proteins [
 <xref rid="B5-ijms-21-09230" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The amount of proteins in the 
 <italic>C. acaulis</italic> cypsela is also high in comparison with other Asteraceae plants. For example, the protein content in the 
 <italic>Helianthus annuus</italic> L. cypsela is approx. 200 g/kg [
 <xref rid="B24-ijms-21-09230" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and ranges from 250 to 300 g/kg in the cypsela of 
 <italic>Silybum marianum</italic> (L.) Gaertner [
 <xref rid="B25-ijms-21-09230" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The relatively low content of free amino acids in 
 <italic>C. acaulis</italic> cypselae is typical for plant seeds, e.g., in corn seeds, it ranges from 1 to 10% of the total pool of amino acids [
 <xref rid="B26-ijms-21-09230" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. UPLC-FLD analysis showed the presence of eighteen amino acids, including nine essential, five conditionally essential, and four non-essential (
 <xref rid="ijms-21-09230-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The total mass of the determined amino acids was 328.13 ± 40.10 g/kg cypselae, which corresponds to the soluble protein content.
