<p>The differences between our findings and Spencerâ€™s report [
 <xref rid="B13-ijms-21-09230" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] are probably the results of the use of different analytical techniques. It should be noted that Spencer et al. used gas chromatography with flame ionization detection and thin-layer chromatography in their research. Both these techniques carry a higher risk of misidentification of analytes, compared to the GC-MS used this study. Moreover, the analytical columns used in 1969 did not have such high resolution as those used today. This study therefore verifies the results of Spencer et al. and enriches the knowledge of the composition of
