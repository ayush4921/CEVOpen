<p>The chromatographic analysis showed the presence of three peaks corresponding to tocopherols. An unsymmetrical peak at a retention time of approximately 7 min indicated coelution of 
 <italic>gamma</italic>- + 
 <italic>beta</italic>-tocopherol. The dominant tocopherol in the 
 <italic>C. acaulis</italic> oil was 
 <italic>alpha</italic>-tocopherol (1.96 ± 0.09 g/kg oil). The content of 
 <italic>delta</italic>- and 
 <italic>gamma</italic>- + 
 <italic>beta</italic>-tocopherols was significantly lower, i.e., 6.35 ± 0.41, and 39.20 ± 0.76 mg/kg, respectively. The chromatographic analysis did not reveal the presence of tocotrienols. An example of a chromatogram is presented in
