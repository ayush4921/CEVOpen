<p>The analysis of the oil carried out with the use of attenuated ATR-IR revealed the presence of ten peaks (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-09230-f005">Figure 5</xref>C). Abdullah et al. [
 <xref rid="B27-ijms-21-09230" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] recorded the IR spectrum of linolenic acid, which showed peaks with the following wavenumber values: 3009 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> C=C bending vibration (aliphatic), 2927, 2855 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> C–H stretching vibration (aliphatic), 1719 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> C=O stretching vibration (carboxylic acid), 1284 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> C–O stretching asymmetric (carboxylic acid), 937 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> C–H bending vibration (alkene), and 722 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> group vibration (aliphatic). The presence of some of these peaks (3008, 2922, 2852, 1743, and 721 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>) in the IR spectrum of the 
 <italic>C. acaulis</italic> cypsela oil may suggest the presence of structural elements common to many fatty acids. Moreover, the wavenumber peaks 2922.48 and 2852.96 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> can be derived from asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of CH
 <sub>2</sub> and CH
 <sub>3</sub>. Peaks with similar wavenumber values (2927 and 2868 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>) were identified by Guillen and Cabo [
 <xref rid="B28-ijms-21-09230" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] in the IR spectrum of tocopherol, which may confirm the presence of tocopherols in the tested oil. However, unambiguous assignment of specific structures to all recorded signals is difficult due to the complex qualitative composition and quantitative diversity of the sample components.
