<p>As shown in literature, pentacyclic triterpenes (ursolic and oleanolic acid, lupeol, amirin and their acetate derivatives) are present in the green parts and flower heads of 
 <italic>C. acaulis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B11-ijms-21-09230" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Since these compounds are non-polar, they should also be present in the oil fraction [

 <xref rid="B33-ijms-21-09230" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], the chromatographic analysis revealed the absence of these triterpenes in the oil from 
 <italic>C. acaulis</italic> cypselae.
