<p>The oil obtained by hexane extraction of ground cypselae constituted 25 ± 2% of their weight. It was a light-yellow liquid (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-09230-f005">Figure 5</xref>A). The trace absorbance at 451 nm indicated the presence of small amounts of carotenoids, which was confirmed by the spectrophotometric analysis. It was shown that the content of carotenoids in the tested oil was 3.23 mg/g and the content of chlorophyll was 0.008 mg/g. Absorbance at a wavelength of 275 nm may indicate the presence of tocopherols, especially 
 <italic>alpha</italic>-tocopherol absorbing radiation in the range of 265–310 nm (max 293 nm). The lack of absorbance at 320–370 wavelengths may indicate the absence of polyphenolic compounds such as chlorogenic acids, apigenin, quercetin, luteolin, and kaempferol derivatives.
