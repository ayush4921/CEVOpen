<p>The chromatographic analysis showed the presence of one dominant compound with a retention time of approx. 20 min, which was identified as chlorogenic acid. In addition, small amounts of neochlorogenic acid and trace amounts of more polar unidentified metabolites were visible in the chromatogram in the first 10 min of the analysis. An example of a chromatogram is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-09230-f006">Figure 6</xref>. The content of neochlorogenic and chlorogenic acids was 0.22 ± 0.02 g/kg and 21.47 ± 1.36 g/kg, respectively. It should be emphasized that the content of chlorogenic acid in the 
 <italic>C. acaulis</italic> cypsela is very high in comparison with other plants from the Asteraceae family. For example, sunflower seeds contain about 0.73–0.97 g/kg of this acid [

 <italic>C. acaulis</italic> was at the level of 10 g/kg [
 <xref rid="B12-ijms-21-09230" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], which is more than two-fold lower than in the cypsela. In turn, 3,5-di-caffeoylquinic acid determined in the green parts [
 <xref rid="B12-ijms-21-09230" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] was not detected in the cypsela.
