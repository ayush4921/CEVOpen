<p>Some reports described the presence of flavonoid compounds in 
 <italic>C. acaulis</italic> plants [
 <xref rid="B10-ijms-21-09230" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], whereas the HPTLC screening of the hydrolyzed extract did not reveal the presence of flavonoid aglycones (myricetin, quercetin, apigenin, and kaempferol). This may indicate the absence of glycoside derivatives of these flavonoids in 
 <italic>C. acaulis</italic> cypselae.
