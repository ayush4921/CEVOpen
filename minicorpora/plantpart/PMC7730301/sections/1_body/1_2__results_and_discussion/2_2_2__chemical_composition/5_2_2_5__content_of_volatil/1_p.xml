<p>The percentage composition of volatile compounds (VOC) detected in the 
 <italic>C. acaulis</italic> cypselae is specified in 
 <xref rid="ijms-21-09230-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. Examples of chromatograms and mass spectra are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-09230">Figure S3 and Table S2</xref>, respectively. Thirty-eight compounds belonging to different chemical classes were identified: ketones, aldehydes, esters, and heterocyclic hydrocarbons. The VOC composition in the seeds highly corresponded with their lipid content. Myristic and palmitic acid esters were contained in all the analyzed samples with relatively highest abundance in the cypselae. Monoterpenes and butanoic acid derivatives were present mainly in the ground seeds. The husk contained the lowest amounts of VOCs.
