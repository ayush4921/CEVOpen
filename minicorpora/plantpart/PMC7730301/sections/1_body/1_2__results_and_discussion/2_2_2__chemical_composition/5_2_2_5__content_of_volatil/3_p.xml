<p>Monoterpenes, represented by eucalyptol, camphor, bornyl acetate, limonene, camphene, and 3-carene, were identified in 
 <italic>C. acaulis</italic> embryo after grinding. They constituted about 15% of total VOCs, although they were not detected in the cypselae. They are probably located in the inner layer of cypsela idioblast cells and are available after crushing. Moreover, the husk constituted a barrier in the release of volatile compounds. Although terpenes are not predominant compounds in cypselae, they were reported in related species of the 
 <italic>Asteraceae</italic> family, e.g., 
 <italic>Cirsium setidens</italic> [

 <italic>Heliantum annuum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B24-ijms-21-09230" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Interestingly, most of the monoterpenes observed in the study derive from one biosynthetic pathway, hence the low complexity of these derivatives.
