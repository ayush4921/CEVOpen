<p>Some reports show that 
 <italic>C. acaulis</italic> is a relatively good accumulator of metals, for example cadmium and silver [

 <xref rid="B37-ijms-21-09230" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Therefore, the content of toxic elements in cypselae was assessed. Pb and As were not detected; however, Cd (0.35 ± 0.00 mg/kg), Ni (2.51 ± 0.025 mg/kg), and Al (3.65 ± 0.02 mg/kg) were found. The contents of these metals were relatively low, which can be explained by the protective mechanism of plants preventing accumulation of heavy metals in generative organs [
