<p>The analysis performed with the ICP-OES technique allowed determination of the profile of macro- and microelements in 
 <italic>C. acaulis</italic> cypsela. The content of macronutrients (g/kg) was as follows: K 12.4 ± 0.07, Mg 5.20 ± 0.04, Ca 3.35 ± 0.03, P 12.04 ± 0.11, and S 7.82 ± 0.08. In turn, the following amounts of micronutrients (mg/kg) were detected: Cu 29.92 ± 0.24, Mn 18.19 ± 1.03, Mo 8.34 ± 0.08, Zn 81.04 ± 0.32, and Fe 109.70 ± 2.85. Co and Cr were not detected. Tyler and Zohlen [
 <xref rid="B34-ijms-21-09230" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] assessed the content of metals in seeds of 35 plant species growing on various types of soil. They showed the following ranges of the content (g/kg) of K, Mg, Ca, P, and S: 8.91–8.95, 2.31–2.53, 7.98–9.86, 4.15–7.71, and 2.44–2.47, respectively. They also showed that the contents of such micronutrients as Cu, Mn, Mo, Zn, and Fe were in the range of 11–12, 49–77, 0.12–0.15, 35–43, and 73 mg/kg, respectively. Załuski and Janeczko [
 <xref rid="B35-ijms-21-09230" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] reported that 
 <italic>Eleuterococcus senticosus</italic> fruits contained the following amounts of macro- (g/kg) and micro- (mg/kg) elements: Ca 2.49–6.88, Mg 1.43–2.81, Fe 35–53, Mn 75–364, Zn 19–41, and Cu 3–13. Hence, it can be concluded that 
 <italic>C. acaulis</italic> cypselae are a rich source of macro- and microelements, as the content of these components is on average two or three times higher than in seeds of other plants.
