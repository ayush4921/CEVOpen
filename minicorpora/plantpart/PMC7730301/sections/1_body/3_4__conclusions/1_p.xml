<p>In this study, the morphological and anatomical features as well as the chemical composition of 
 <italic>C. acaulis</italic> cypselae were described. Our research showed that the cypselae are a rich source of nutrients such as protein (with a high proportion of essential amino acids), unsaturated fatty acids, and macro- and microelements; therefore, they can be a valuable supplement of the diet. The high content of tocopherols and chlorogenic acid indicates the health promoting properties of the cypselae, as the biological activity of these compounds, including strong antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, antilipidemic, and antihypertensive activity, is widely described in the scientific literature. This study expands the knowledge of 
 <italic>C. acaulis.</italic>
