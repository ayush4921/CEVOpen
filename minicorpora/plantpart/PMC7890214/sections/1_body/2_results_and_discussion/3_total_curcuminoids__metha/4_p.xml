<p id="p0100">The use of turmeric is spreading internationally, and its production must be increased to meet national and international demands. In this study, Dame is the most promising variety containing the highest amount of curcuminoids, methanol extract and essential oil yield among the turmeric varieties grown in Ethiopia. 
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Kifelew et al. (2018)</xref> reported that Bonga 51/71, HT3/2002 and Dame were the best performing genotypes in terms of growth parameters and yield attributes before they were released as turmeric varieties. Previous research (
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Singh et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Aarthi et al., 2020</xref>) indicated that growth and yield parameters impact curcuminoids, oleoresin and essential oil yield of turmeric rhizomes positively. To introduce turmeric cultivation into non-traditional areas, varieties that are good in productivity, and that give high bioactive extract need to be identified. Therefore, the results of this study show a promising opportunity for selecting a turmeric variety with good amount of chemical composition that can bring socio-economic transformations and improve the livelihoods of turmeric farmers in Ethiopia.
