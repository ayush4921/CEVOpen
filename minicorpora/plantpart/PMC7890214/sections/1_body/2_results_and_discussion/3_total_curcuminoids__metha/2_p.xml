<p id="p0090">The mean curcuminoids contents of the three turmeric varieties were significantly different from each other and the highest (6.81%) and the lowest (5.12%) curcuminoids contents were obtained from Dame and HT3/2002 varieties, respectively (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The results shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> indicate that the mean methanol extracts and essential oil yields obtained from Bonga 51/71 and Dame varieties were not significantly different. The highest (13.62%) methanol extract was obtained from Bonga 51/71, while the lowest (10.58%) was obtained from HT3/2002 variety. Similarly, the mean essential oil yields from Dame and Bonga 51/71 varieties were not statistically different but were significantly higher than the one from HT3/2002 variety (
