This institution introduced ‘Dame’ variety in 2007 and ‘Bonga 51/71’ and ‘HT3/2002’ varieties in 2018. These varieties had been widely adopted in different parts of Ethiopia. They were evaluated for yield (kg/ha) and some quality attributes of the rhizomes (

However, there is no study on the chemical composition and the essential and therapeutic values of turmeric varieties grown in Ethiopia.
