<p>Guayule flowers are arranged in heads or capitula. These heads are about 5 mm in diameter and contains five rays, producing one seed each, and a flower disk, producing pollen. When the seed germinates, we can see first a short primary stem, terminating in a long slender taproot. The cotyledons (first leaves) are circular and few millimeters. The primary stem grows and becomes dark red if exposed to sunlight, or green if not. The first leaves are closely crowded, ovate and green-gray, satiny sheen. In the field, they can reach a length of 7–8 cm and a width of 1.5 cm. The first inflorescence may occur during the first 6 months. The root develops in a strong tap root system extending in many strong lateral roots that can reach 1 to 2 m. From these lateral roots, “adventitious shoots”, called “retoños”, can expand especially on the thin-soiled, rocky slopes where the seedling growth is difficult [
