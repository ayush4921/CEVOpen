<p>Guayule cultivation practices have been reviewed by Whitworth and Whitehead [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-26-00664" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Guayule is adapted to hot desert environments and to sites with different soils (shallow, stony, calcareous and friable) and with relatively low concentrations of nutrients, but it grows best in well-drained soils and cannot tolerate waterlogging [

Some studies about the impact of irrigation have shown that rubber content decreases with irrigation amount, except with subsurface drip irrigation, where rubber yields are increased with irrigation amount, because the biomass increases too [
