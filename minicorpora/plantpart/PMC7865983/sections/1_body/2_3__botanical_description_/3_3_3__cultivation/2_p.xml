<p>The first step of cultivation consists of collecting the seeds. They can be removed from the plant easily by hand or by mechanical means. Several vacuum harvesters have been developed, from the Intercontinental Rubber Company’s, to the Bridgestone/Firestone’s one, powered by an electric generator, mounted on a high-profile tractor. Once collected, it is important to break seed dormancy. An example of protocol to promote germination under acute osmotic stress, with a conditioning process follows. Seeds are left imbibing under aerobic conditions in a medium containing: 25% polyethylene glycol (MW 8000), 10 mmol gibberellic acid, 0.05% potassium nitrate, and 0.1% Thiram adjusted to pH 8.0 with a saturated solution of calcium hydroxide. They are then treated at 25 °C in continuous light for three to four days and air dried [
