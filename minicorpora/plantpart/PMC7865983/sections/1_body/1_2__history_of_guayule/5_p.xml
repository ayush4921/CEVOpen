<p>In the 1990s, the interest shifted from crude GNR to latex (GNRL). Until then, the focus was on dry rubber obtained by a solvent extraction process, for tyres production. With the development of an extraction process in latex form at the US Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS) [

In 2008, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of GNRL for the manufacture non-allergenic gloves. At the same time, in Europe, the Realizing the Economic Potential of Renewable Resources-Bioproducts from Non-food Crops (EPOBIO) project (2005–2007), aimed to “design new generations of bio-based products derived from plant raw materials” [
