<p>The first reported use of guayule, other than by the Aztec natives, was by the Mechanical Rubber Company, obtaining a “large quantity” of rubber, in 1888 in New Jersey. In the early 1900s, the first guayule factories were built in Mexico and rubber exported to the US. In 1902, the activities at the experimental laboratory at San Luis Potosi led to the establishment of a factory in Jimulco, representing the Compañía Explotadora de Caucho Mexicano. Guayule rubber (GNR) was put on the market, for the first time, in 1905. From that time on, extraction factories of various sizes were established in San Luis Potosi, Saltillo, Monterey, Gomez Palacio, as well as in Torreon and Jimulco [

Threatened by the Mexican Revolution, crops were transferred to California under the name of the American Rubber Producers, an incorporation of the Intercontinental Rubber Company. At that time, 50% of U.S. rubber were extracted from wild shrubs [

 <xref rid="B17-molecules-26-00664" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. It was therefore decided not to use wild shrubs, but rather to establish fields throughout California and Arizona. In the 1920s, the Intercontinental Rubber Company in California produced 1400 tons of rubber. Production decreased with the Great Depression in 1929 [

The Italian Government signed a pact with the US Intercontinental Rubber Company, to establish guayule in Italy. Different areas in southern Italy and northern Africa were evaluated to assess a potential production. 5000 ha were identified as sufficient to fulfill the Italian needs. In 1937, the Agro-industrial Society of Anonymous Rubber (SAIGA) was officially established to develop guayule cultivation in Italy [

 <italic>Hevea</italic> rubber supply to the US from South-East Asia was cut off because of the invasion by the Japanese during World War II. The U.S. Government purchased the experimental records, seed stocks, and holdings of the Intercontinental Rubber Co, and the US Department of Agriculture established the Emergency Rubber Project: the plantation of 12,140 ha of guayule was launched and an extensive research program was initiated [

 <italic>Hevea</italic> rubber from Asia with a better quality than to use local guayule rubber [
