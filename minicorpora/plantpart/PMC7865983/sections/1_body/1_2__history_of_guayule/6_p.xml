<p>The Production and Exploitation of Alternative Rubber and Latex Sources (EU-PEARLS) project, a continuation of the EPOBIO project, was launched in 2008 to study the development, exploitation and sustainable use of guayule and Kazakh dandelion, aiming at investigating the cultivation of the two crops in four countries: The Netherlands, Germany, France and Spain. Furthermore, in 2011, the first European study on guayule entitled “Agronomic evaluation of guayule cultivation in two northern Mediterranean areas” was presented at the AAIC meeting [

In 2013, Yulex entered a joint venture with Versalis and Pirelli in Europe, for the construction of an industrial plant in the southern EU, including testing GNR for tyres. Unfortunately, that plant was never built for economical reasons [

Today, several universities and research centers (USDA/ARS, University of Arizona and Ohio State University in the U.S., CIRAD in France, Keygene and Wageningen University in The Netherlands, University of Bologna in Italy etc..) and companies such as Bridgestone, Cooper Tires, Energyene, GuaySS, and the new start-up, GuaTecs, are working on guayule, in domains ranging from genetics and agronomy to the production of rubber and latex (
