<p>The biosynthesis of the polymer is catalyzed by a membrane-bound 
 <italic>cis</italic>-prenyl transferase, named rubber transferase (EC 2.5.1.20), part of the monolayer membrane that surrounds cytosolic rubber particles. Polymerization takes place within the membrane monolayer boundary between nonpolar rubber particles and the aqueous medium. It involves three steps: initiation, polymerization, and termination [
