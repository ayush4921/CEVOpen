<p>PI in guayule is 
 <italic>cis</italic>-1,4-polyisoprene, except for the first added monomers which are 
 <italic>trans</italic>-1,4-polyisoprene, in the case of 
 <italic>Hevea</italic> and thus probably also in the case of guayule, based on known similar biosynthetic routes [

 <xref rid="B44-molecules-26-00664" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. They lead to farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), the main basic precursor, formed with dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) and two IPP in 
 <italic>trans</italic>-configuration. Several IPP-units in 
 <italic>cis</italic>-configuration are added to FPP to form the polymer. The two pathways also lead to fatty acids, monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, diterpenes, triterpenes and tetraterpenes too [
