0: Polyisoprene (PI, the polymer taken as a whole whatever its stereoisomeric structure and origin) can be used in two different forms, either as latex (the polymer being dispersed in water, as a white liquid) or dry rubber (obtained by latex coagulation) [in this review, polyisoprene applies to the polymer molecule, while rubber is used when talking about the material which is a mixture of polyisoprene and of other components like proteins and small molecules].
1: PI is used in more than 40,000 products, like tyres, medical gloves or condoms.
2: Synthetic routes provide a large amount of PI and of similar polymers, but natural rubber and latex from  Hevea (NR and NL, respectively) remain irreplaceable for some applications, like plane and truck tyres or medical gloves thanks to the peculiar  cis chemical structure of the contained PI and to the presence of other molecules [ 2].
3: Indeed NR shows better dynamic properties, especially resilience (defined as the ability to undergo big deformations without breaking and to recover its initial form when the constraint is released), as well as very good resistance to abrasion, shock and tearing [ 3, 4].
