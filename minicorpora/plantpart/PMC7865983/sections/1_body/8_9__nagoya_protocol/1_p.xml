<p>The Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization (ABS) is an international agreement, adopted on October 2010 in Nagoya, Japan [
 <xref rid="B126-molecules-26-00664" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>]. One hundred and twenty three (123) countries have ratified this agreement, including Mexico. The US havenâ€™t up to now. The two main objectives are to protect biodiversity and to share the benefits arising from the use of a country genetic resources. Therefore, it is compulsory to declare the industrial use of guayule seeds to the country of origin. In the present case if the seeds originate from natural stands in the US, no need to declare, but if they are coming from natural stands in Mexico, an agreement with this country has to be edited.
