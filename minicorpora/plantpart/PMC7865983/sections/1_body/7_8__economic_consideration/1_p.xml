 <italic>Hevea</italic> trees cannot support alone the growing demand. Indeed, this crop suffers several constraints affecting production and price stability: a growing demand from the China and India; the South-American leaf blight disease (
 <italic>Microcyclus ulei</italic>), potentially capable of displacing and destroying 
 <italic>Hevea</italic> plantations in South-East Asia, whereas they are already under attack by another leaf disease due to another fungus (

 <italic>Hevea</italic> grows in tropical and equatorial areas with high rainfall, and these are not extensible—unless contributing to deforestation—and even shrinking with the development of oil palm and global warming [
