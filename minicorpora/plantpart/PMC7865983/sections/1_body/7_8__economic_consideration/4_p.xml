   <p>Some of them try to reduce production costs by investing in the agronomical practices and extraction process in order to increase the yields. Using varietal selection in order to increase field yield for example.</p>

   <p>Others try to sell manufactured products (like gloves or tyres) rather than raw-materials (latex or rubber) because the last make generally a small part of the end-product price. This is vertical integration.</p>

   <p>The last way is a kind of horizontal integration by valorizing all coproducts: latex, rubber, resin, bagasse… The bio-refinery path: relying on different products and markets, in order to cover the production cost.</p>
