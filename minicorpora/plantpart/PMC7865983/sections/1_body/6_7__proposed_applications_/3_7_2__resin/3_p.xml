<p>Argentatins A and B have antimicrobial activities [
 <xref rid="B110-molecules-26-00664" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>] and can also play a role in cancer treatment [
 <xref rid="B111-molecules-26-00664" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. Argentatin A is cytotoxic against K562, MCF-7, PC-3, HCT-15 and U251 human cancer cell lines and against proliferating lymphocytes at a concentration of 25 µM, and it also shows a higher potency on prostate cancer cells. It has no cytostatic nor genotoxic effects on lymphocytes at the same concentration. Argentatin B is cytotoxic against the same human cancer lines as argentatin A, but not on proliferating lymphocytes at a concentration of 25 µM. This compound is shown to be better to treat cancer than the currently used ones, which generally induce second malignances [
