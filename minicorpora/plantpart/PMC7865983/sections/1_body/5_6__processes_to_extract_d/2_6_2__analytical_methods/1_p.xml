<p>The different industrial processes were adapted for analysis of PI content in the plant and for analysis of PI extractable as latex. Solvent methods are used to assess the PI content in the plant. Researchers choose between an adapted sequential method, accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) (three 20-min cycles at 40 °C with acetone and three 20-min cycles at 120°C with cyclohexane or hexane) [

 <xref rid="B96-molecules-26-00664" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>] describes the determination of the resin content by UV absorption directly on the acetone extract, and of the PI content by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) coupled to evaporative light scattering (ELS) on the cyclohexane extract, after ASE extraction. Instead of using solvent processes, Suchat and al. [

This method is based on vibration properties of organic molecules. Chemical bonds can be used to retrieve the chemical composition. The calibration was performed with the ASE method, and attempts are made through measuring directly on the branch, to avoid the biomass grinding step, towards a fast routine technique [
