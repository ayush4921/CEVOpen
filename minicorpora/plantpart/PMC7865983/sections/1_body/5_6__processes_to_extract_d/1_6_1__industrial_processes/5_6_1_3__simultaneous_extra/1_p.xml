<p>In the simultaneous extraction process, the entire plant, including leaves, is initially broken down in size into small pieces with a double stage hammer mill. A solvent is added, usually hexane/acetone (75/25), forming an azeotropic mixture. The extraction lasts 1 or 2 h. The rubber and resin are then separated by adjusting the ratio between the polar and nonpolar solvent. Particules are removed by filtration or centrifugation. However, this process presents also some weak points, particularly the fact that solvents are expensive, unless recycled [
