<p>Sequential extraction is the oldest solvent process. It has been evaluated in a semi-batch mode at USDA/ARS. After being defoliated, air-dried plants are grounded into little flakes. These are processed through two extraction steps. First, they are extracted with acetone, for removing the resin and then with cyclohexane, for removing GNR. It can be by immersion, gravity percolation or counter current percolation. The solvents are then evaporated. Buchanan patented a sequential solvent process with the action of compressive and shear forces and solvent, being first acetone and then hexane [
