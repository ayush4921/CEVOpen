<p>Cornish has found that the rubber extraction is extremely sensitive to the hexane concentration in the extractor in the course of the extraction cycle. Rubber is only extracted at significant rates when the hexane concentration is extremely high. This team proposed a process using an expanded hexane solvent, rather than a supercritical carbon dioxide one with hexane as co-solvent, with a solvent/feedstock ratio of 2:1 or 3:1 by weight [
