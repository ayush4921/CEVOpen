<p>The oldest method to extract rubber is flotation. It was the first industrial process used in the early 1900s, in the Mexican pilot plant at Saltillo, Coahuila, operated by the Centro de Investigación en Química Aplicada (CIQA). The wild shrubs are parboiled in hot water, for half an hour. This allows removing leaves and coagulating the rubber in the cells. The plants are then ground in a hammermill and pulped in a Bauer mill, using a water solution with sodium hydroxide to open cells. Milling and softening steps with water are also done in the reverse order. The mixture is then decanted in a tank, until the woody tissue takes-up water, sinks to the bottom, and the resinous rubber floats in what are called “worms”. These worms are skimmed from the top. They usually contain a high proportion of resin. To get rid of the resin, the small masses of gum are treated with an alkaline solution or with alcohol, preferably under high temperature [

   <p>The treatment with caustic alkali brings a reduction in the acetone soluble content (resin) in the rubber, but the rubber is deteriorated by the long-continued agitation. It loses “nerve”, becoming softer and plastic [

   <p>The usual method of disposing of this bagasse is to burn it as fuel but, because of the residual rubber, it is an expensive fuel and it implies a great loss to the manufacturer [

   <p>Shrubs are harvested and then usually left for a time, which varies greatly, in the sun. This drying negatively affects the quality and the yield of rubber extraction [

   <p>A lot of rubber is still trapped in the bagasse, but a prolonged grinding in view of increasing the yield reduces the tensile-elongation properties of the rubber and makes it softer and thus more liable to retain fiber and other foreign matter [
