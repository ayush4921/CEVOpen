<p>In a study of spontaneous hemp, Nagy et al. [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-25-04631" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] reported that the EO was majorly composed of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (57.1 to 62.8%), followed by cannabinoids (11.0 to 29.3%) and oxygenated sesquiterpenes (7.8 to 14.8%). Overall, the results from this study suggest that wild/spontaneous hemp in Europe is chemotaxonomically related to the industrial hemp varieties (cultivars) grown in Europe and deviate from the chemical profile of the USA hemp strain that was developed from marijuana-type cannabis for the commercial production of CBD. The USA hemp strain used in this study was started with feminized seed, which guarantees the production of female only plants, which may be one of the reasons for its much higher EO content.
