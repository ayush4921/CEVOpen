<p>The pharmacological power of hemp is based on the content of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA) and cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) [

Like with marijuana production, hemp ‘Christmas tree’ production systems rely on feminized seed, because female plants with non-fertilized flowers (flower bracts) accumulate significantly higher concentrations of secondary metabolites such as cannabinoids and terpenes compared with fertilized flowers [

Currently, hemp chemical production is based on non-registered hemp ‘strains’ that were originally developed by marijuana breeders, which must meet government regulations for hemp with less than 0.3% Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA) in the dried biomass. Due to the rapidly growing market for non-psychoactive cannabinoids, mainly cannabidiol (CBD), most of production has been focused on cannabidiolic acid (CBDA). Newer hemp strains bred for these characteristics are more likely to be compliant, and breeding companies are working on the registration of a number of hemp strains with high CBD content as commercial cultivars. The results from this study demonstrate that wild hemp may be a good source for further selection and breeding of cultivars with high concentration of CBD and low concentrations of THC.
