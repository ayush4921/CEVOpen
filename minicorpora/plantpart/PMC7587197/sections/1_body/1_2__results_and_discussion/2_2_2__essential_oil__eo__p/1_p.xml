<p>For the wild hemps, two locations (Kovacica and Susara) were randomly selected among the nine locations (Slavka, Kovacica, Buro, Daleka zemlia, Susara, Saykaj, Perez, Titelski breg, and Paluka) to be used as two replications to represent wild hemp in the statistical analyses. As indicated in the Materials and Methods section, one-way ANOVA was completed to determine the significance of differences between the mean constituents obtained from nine hemp cultivars from Northeast Serbia. The constituents were: α-pinene, β-pinene, isocaryophyllene (γ-caryophyllene), β-caryophyllene, α-(E)-bergamotene, (Z)-β-farnesene, caryophyllene oxide, humulene epoxide 2, selina-6-en-4-ol, caryophylla-4(12),8(13)-dien-5α-ol, caryophylla-4(12),8(13)-dien-5β-ol, 14-hydroxy-(Z)-caryophyllene, β-bisabolol, α-bisabolol, CBD, and δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol.</p>
