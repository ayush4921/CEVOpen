<p>The concentration of β-caryophyllene was 15 to 30% in the EO of wild hemp, 22 to 55% in the registered cultivars, and 11 to 22% in the EO of the breeding lines (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-04631">Supplementary Tables S1–S3</xref>). Overall, statistically, the highest concentration of β-caryophyllene was found in the EO of cv. Spic and the lowest in the EOs of cvs. Simba and Dioica (
