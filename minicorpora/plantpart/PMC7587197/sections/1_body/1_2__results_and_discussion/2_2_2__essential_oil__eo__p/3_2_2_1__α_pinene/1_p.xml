<p>The concentration range of α-pinene (bicyclic monoterpene) in the EO was from non-detected (n.d.) in three accessions of wild hemp to 2.5% in wild hemp Slavka; from n.d. to 8.4% in the registered cultivars; and 0.15 to 2.95% in the new breeding lines (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-04631">Supplementary Tables S1–S3</xref>). However, when grouped together, the concentration of α-pinene in the EO was not statistically different between the three groups of hemp. The concentration of α-pinene in the EO of the USA hemp strain (grown in the vicinity of the registered cultivars in this study and extracted the same way for the same time duration) was 3.6 to 4.5% of the total EO. The monoterpenes pinene and limonene are the determinants of cannabis aroma in the immediate vicinity of the plant [

 <xref rid="B15-molecules-25-04631" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], while the EO of spontaneous (wild) hemp from Hungary contained 1.6, 2.9, and 0.7% of this compound in the leaves, male, and female flowers, respectively. These differences may be due to the environment (growing conditions including latitude and altitude), the plant parts analyzed, and/or the genetics (cultivar).
