 <xref rid="B18-molecules-25-04631" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] have demonstrated that the EO profile of wild hemp can vary significantly. Therefore, genetic analyses may be needed to ascertain if the spontaneous or wild hemps in Europe originated from some of the old industrial hemp cultivars that have been grown in Europe over the last few centuries or from medical cannabis, or are products of spontaneous crossings between the two groups.
