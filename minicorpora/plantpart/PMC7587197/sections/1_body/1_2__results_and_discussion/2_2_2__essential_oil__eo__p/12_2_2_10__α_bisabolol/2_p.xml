<p>The major EO constituents of the USA hemp strain that was grown in close vicinity had a different chemical profile, with major constituents of myrcene (9.2 to 12%), β-caryophyllene (6.5 to 7.5%), limonene (3.8 to 4.2%), β-(E)-ocimene (5.3 to 5.6%), and α-bisabolol (3.9 to 4.4%). Some previous reports identified a different number of EO constituents in hemp EO (e.g., 55 EO constituents, with myrcene, α-pinene, and β-pinene as the main monoterpenes, and β-caryophyllene as the main sesquiterpene) [

 <xref rid="B18-molecules-25-04631" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The latter authors named these hemp plants spontaneous forms, with the main EO constituents of the leaves, male and female flowers being E-caryophyllene (28.3%), α-humulene (8.9 to 9.3%), β-selinene (4.3 to 7.3%), and α-selinene (2.9 to 5.1%) [

Apparently, the spontaneous hemp plants from Hungary had a different EO chemical profile compared with the EO of the wild hemp of this study that was collected in the northeastern part of Serbia. The hydro-distilled leaf EO of wild hemp in Austria contained mainly β-caryophyllene (26.2%), α-humulene (13.1%), β-selinene (5.0%), caryophyllenen oxide (4.5%), and α-selinene (4.4%) [

 <xref rid="B15-molecules-25-04631" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Apparently, the EO of wild hemp in Austria had a similar composition to some, but not to other wild hemp EOs, in this study.
