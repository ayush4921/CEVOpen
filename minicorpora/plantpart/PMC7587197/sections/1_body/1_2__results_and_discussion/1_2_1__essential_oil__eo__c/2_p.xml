<p>Overall, the EOs of the wild hemps and registered cultivars in this study were similar to those reported previously: 0.23 to 0.31% in fresh inflorescences [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-25-04631" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], 0.29 to 0.19% depending on the collection time with higher EO yield from plants sampled earlier (in September than in October) [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-25-04631" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and 0.1% in stems and 0.15% in the leaves of wild hemp from Austria [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-25-04631" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], respectively. However, the EO content of the USA hemp strain, utilized for CBD production in the USA and grown near the field trials was 1.15 to 1.2%.
