<p>The EO yield of the wild hemp accessions varied from 0.085 to 0.262 mL/100 g for air-dried material and the yield of the breeding lines was 0.06 to 0.14, while the EO yield of the registered cultivars was 0.1 to 0.2 mL/100 g of dried material. However, the overall differences in oil yield between the three groups of hemp were not significantly different, with an overall mean of 0.129 mL/100 dried material (
