<p>Overall, the concentration of THC in the EO was significantly different between the three groups of hemp (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04631-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The THC concentration was significantly higher in the EO of wild hemp accessions, with an average of 2.4% of the total oil, and a range between n.d. (in Daleka Zemlia) and 3.4% (in Kovacica) (

Interestingly, it was much higher than the THC (0.16%) in the EO of the USA hemp strain, which was actually developed from marijuana type hemp. The THC concentration in the EO of most of the registered cultivars varied from n.d. (e.g., in cvs. Spic and Bacalmas) to over 1.2% (in the EO of cv. Chameleon) (

The THC concentration in the EO of the breeding lines was generally low, n.d., or below 0.4% with the exception of line SK8, where it reached 3.6% of the total oil. Previous research has shown that hydro-distilled EO from industrial hemp varieties contained cannabidiol (CBD) [
