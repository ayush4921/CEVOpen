<p>In this study, the concentration of CBD in the EO of wild hemp varied from 6.9 to 52.4% of the total oil, the CBD in the EO of the registered cultivars was from 7.1 to 25.4%, while the CBD concentration in the oil of the breeding lines was from 6.4 to 25.4% (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-04631">Supplementary Tables S1â€“S3</xref>). However, when we grouped them together, because of the high variation, there were no significant differences between the wild accessions, registered cultivars, and the breeding lines with overall means of 12.4% (

The concentration of CBD in the EO of the USA strain (which is commercially grown for CBD production) varied between 7.5 and 7.8% of the total EO, which is an interesting result. The CBD concentrations in the EO of wild hemp Slavka, Kovacica, Susara, Perez and Titelski breg were 14.9, 22.6, 11.3, 17.5, and 15.7%, respectively, while the CBD concentrations in the EO of Buro and Saykaj were 52.4 and 33.7%, respectively. Therefore, this and previous studies [
