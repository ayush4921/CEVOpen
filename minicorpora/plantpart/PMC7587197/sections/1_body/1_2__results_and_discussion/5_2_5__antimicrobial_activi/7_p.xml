<p>Overall, the findings in this study are consistent with the ones in a recent report [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-25-04631" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This study provides new information on the antimicrobial activity of the EOs of the registered and wild hemps. Good antimicrobial activity against Enterococcus, Listeria, and Staphylococcus growth were found, which were compared to the conventional antibiotics that were used [

 <xref rid="B31-molecules-25-04631" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] found that the EO of five different cultivars of hemp had modest antibacterial activity. The Gram-positive bacterial strains tested demonstrated high sensitivity toward cannabidiol, with slightly lower effects by cannabidiolic acid [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-25-04631" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Due to significant antimicrobial potency of CBD against MRSA, the synergy with conventional antibiotics was tested. However, CBD was not able to revert the resistance pattern or demonstrate synergy with any of the conventional antibiotics tested [
