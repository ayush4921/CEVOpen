0: The hemp EO profile depends on genotype, growth conditions, and extraction method (steam, hydro, CO 2, or solvent extraction) [ 10].
1: Of the various groups of terpenes, monoterpenes such as limonene, -myrcene, -pinene, -pinene, and linalool (containing 10 carbon units) comprise the major portion of the volatile oil fraction [ 10].
2: These EO constituents are widely found in the EO of other plant species such as spices, EO crops, and medicinal herbs; they are not specific to cannabis.
3: Sesquiterpenes (with 15 carbons) such as -caryophyllene, -humulene, caryophyllene oxide, and -phellandrene are also present in higher concentrations in hemp extracts [ 9, 10].
4: Monoterpene composition can distinguish between monoecious and dioecious hemp cultivars [ 10].
5: Furthermore, certain terpenoids are highly correlated to the concentration of CBD and 9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA); consequently, they have been proposed as a chemotaxonomic classification tool and to distinguish drug-type cannabis in Nevada [ 11].
6: Overall, hemp varieties (cultivars) with a higher concentration of monoterpenes have a more pleasant aroma compared with the varieties with higher amounts of sesquiterpenes.
7: The monoterpenes pinene and limonene are the determinants of cannabis aroma in the immediate vicinity of the plant [ 12].
8: Hydro-distilled EO from industrial hemp cultivars may contain CBD [ 10]; the interaction of environment and genetics plays a role in the hemp EO profile.
