0: Hemp essential oil (EO) can be extracted using various extraction methods, the simplest and most natural using either steam or hydro-distillation, as is the case with many other EO crops.
1: Hydro-distilled or steam distilled hemp EO are generally preferred by consumers and can be incorporated into a number of certified organic products; the market for organic food and non-food products reached US$55 billion in 2019 in the USA alone [ 2].
2: Currently, cannabidiol (CBD) production and markets in many countries are depressed due to the 2019 overproduction and the COVID-19 situation.
3: For example, hemp production in the USA has increased rapidly and by mid-2019, there were around 500,000 licensed acres to grow hemp [ 3].
4: That acreage in 2019 would have generated an estimated US$11.3 billion income, or around 6% of the total value of all cash crops in the USA [ 3].
5: However, due to the depressed markets and expensive feminized seed (US$1/seed), there is now significant interest in hemp EO from industrial hemp cultivars and even from wild hemp.
6: Indeed, a number of producers and processors in the USA are developing new products based on naturally extracted hemp EO or cannabinoids.
7: Overall, research suggests that the hemp EO has medical significance and may also be utilized as an ingredient in commercial insect repellents and biopesticides [ 4, 5].
8: Some cultivars such as Finola have been employed for commercial production of EO, as hemp EO has commanded high prices in recent years.
