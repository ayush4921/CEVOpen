0: This study addresses a knowledge gap and current industry interest towards hemp EO with different origins and profile.
1: The hypothesis was that wild hemp would have a different EO content, composition, and antimicrobial activity compared with the EOs of registered industrial hemp cultivars, new hemp breeding lines, and a hemp strain (unregistered cultivar) that is currently used for the commercial production of CBD.
2: The objective of this study was to compare nine wild hemp accessions ( C. sativa spp.
3: spontanea) sampled from agricultural fields in northeastern Serbia with 13 EU registered cultivars, eight breeding lines, and one CBD hemp strain (belonging to  C. sativa) with respect to their EO profile and antimicrobial activity.
