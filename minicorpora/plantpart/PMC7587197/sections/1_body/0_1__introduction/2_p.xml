<p>Hemp essential oil (EO) can be extracted using various extraction methods, the simplest and most natural using either steam or hydro-distillation, as is the case with many other EO crops. Hydro-distilled or steam distilled hemp EO are generally preferred by consumers and can be incorporated into a number of certified organic products; the market for organic food and non-food products reached US$55 billion in 2019 in the USA alone [

Currently, cannabidiol (CBD) production and markets in many countries are depressed due to the 2019 overproduction and the COVID-19 situation. For example, hemp production in the USA has increased rapidly and by mid-2019, there were around 500,000 licensed acres to grow hemp [

However, due to the depressed markets and expensive feminized seed (US$1/seed), there is now significant interest in hemp EO from industrial hemp cultivars and even from wild hemp. Indeed, a number of producers and processors in the USA are developing new products based on naturally extracted hemp EO or cannabinoids. Overall, research suggests that the hemp EO has medical significance and may also be utilized as an ingredient in commercial insect repellents and biopesticides [
