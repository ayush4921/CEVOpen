<p>The hemp EO profile depends on genotype, growth conditions, and extraction method (steam, hydro, CO
 <sub>2</sub>, or solvent extraction) [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-25-04631" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Of the various groups of terpenes, monoterpenes such as limonene, β-myrcene, α-pinene, β-pinene, and linalool (containing 10 carbon units) comprise the major portion of the volatile oil fraction [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-25-04631" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These EO constituents are widely found in the EO of other plant species such as spices, EO crops, and medicinal herbs; they are not specific to cannabis. Sesquiterpenes (with 15 carbons) such as β-caryophyllene, α-humulene, caryophyllene oxide, and β-phellandrene are also present in higher concentrations in hemp extracts [

 <xref rid="B10-molecules-25-04631" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Monoterpene composition can distinguish between monoecious and dioecious hemp cultivars [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-25-04631" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Furthermore, certain terpenoids are highly correlated to the concentration of CBD and Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA); consequently, they have been proposed as a chemotaxonomic classification tool and to distinguish drug-type cannabis in Nevada [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-25-04631" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Overall, hemp varieties (cultivars) with a higher concentration of monoterpenes have a more pleasant aroma compared with the varieties with higher amounts of sesquiterpenes. The monoterpenes pinene and limonene are the determinants of cannabis aroma in the immediate vicinity of the plant [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-25-04631" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Hydro-distilled EO from industrial hemp cultivars may contain CBD [
