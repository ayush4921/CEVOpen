<p>The EO extraction was conducted via hydro-distillation of hemp air-dried material using 4-L hydro-distillation Clevenger-type units as described previously for another plant material [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-25-04631" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The sample size was up to 50 g dry weight (DW) biomass in 1.2 L water. All distillations were performed in two replicates, which was sufficient for statistical analyses. Beginning of the distillation was noted when the first drop of EO was deposited in the collection part of the Clevenger apparatus. All samples were distilled non-stop for 180 min. At the end of the distillation, the heat source was removed, the EOs (along with some water) were collected in glass vials, and placed in a freezer. After all distillations were complete, the EO was separated from water, measured on an analytical scale, and kept in a freezer until the gas chromatography (GC) analyses could be performed.
