<p>Although the botanical classification of hemp is controversial [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-25-04631" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], wild populations belong to uncultivated narrow leaf 
 <italic>Cannabis sativa</italic> ssp. 
 <italic>spontanea</italic> Vavilov [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-25-04631" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], which is considered native to Central and Eastern Europe and parts of Asia. Wild hemp samples in this study were collected from the edges of agricultural fields in the same region that have been used to grow other crops, but not hemp. These were agricultural fields where no hemp has been grown for the last 30 years. However, around 35â€“40 years ago, at some of the collection sites, there were hemp processing factories or hemp seed storage facilities. Generally, wild hemp is phenotypically different from plants of either old or new commercial hemp cultivars; wild hemp also has a shorter stature, with fewer branches than plants from registered cultivars. The locations of the wild hemp samples were named after the names of the nearby villages: Buro, Daleka Zemlia, Paluka, Perez, Saykaj, Susara, Slavka, Kovacica, and Titelski Breg (
