<p>Hemp volatile compounds were analyzed by GC-FID and GC-MS as described previously [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-25-04631" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], with the following modifications: the column temperature was initially set at 40 °C, then increased to 300 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min, which was held for 10 min. The flow rate of the carrier gas (He) was maintained at 1.0 mL/min. The injection volume was 1.0 µL at a split ratio of 30:1. The temperatures of the ionization source, the transfer line, and the injector were 230 °C, 280 °C, and 250 °C, respectively. The MSD was operated in full scan mode. All mass spectra were acquired in electron impact (EI) mode with 70 eV in the

 <italic>z</italic> range of 40–400. The injector and detector temperature (FID) was set at 220 °C and 280 °C, respectively.
