<p>All constituents present in the EO samples were identified by comparing their linear retention indices (LRI) and MS fragmentation patterns with those from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NISTâ€²08) and Adams mass spectra library. The estimated LRI were determined using a mixture of a homologous series of aliphatic hydrocarbons from C
 <sub>8</sub> to C
 <sub>40</sub> under the same conditions described above.
