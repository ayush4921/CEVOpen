<p>Hemp was grown as a rainfed crop without irrigation, as is traditional for the region, and the production technology, which is typical production system for commercial production of hemp in Middle and Southern Europe, was applied. Hemp was seeded with a corn planter on 27 March, 2019 with 50 cm spacing between rows and at a seeding rate of 30 kg/ha. The soil type was alluvial chernozem with pH 7.2., previous crop was millet. The soil preparation prior to seeding included deep plowing on 12 November, 2018 and fine seedbed preparation on 25 March, 2019. The experimental design was completely randomized with three replicates, with the size of the experimental plots being 2 m Ã— 5 m. Fertilizer (NPK 16:16:16) was applied as a broadcast treatment at 300 kg/ha before deep plowing. An additional 50 kg/ha of nitrogen was applied in the spring before sowing. Weed control was conducted using burnout with glyphosate prior to seeding. Mechanized weed control was performed twice during the first four weeks of vegetation stage though the use of sweep-type cultivators. Hemp closes the canopy at 5-6 weeks after emergence and hence, suppresses weeds very well after that. The trial of the breeding lines was at the same field, approximately 60 m from the main trial, and was subjected to the same agricultural conditions. Plants in both trials were cultivated the same way including seeding time, seeding depth, fertilization, and weed control.</p>
