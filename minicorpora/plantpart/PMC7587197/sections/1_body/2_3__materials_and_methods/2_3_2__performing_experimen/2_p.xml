<p>Fresh biomass samples (around 1 kg fresh, in three reps) were obtained on 27 June, 2019 at the beginning of flowering of the male plants. Hemp tissue samples were generated by cutting the top 1.5 feet (46 cm) from the top of female plants (male plants were not included in the samples). Fresh weight was measured, then the samples were hung in a shady area (tobacco dryer) until constant air-dried weight and then extracted.</p>
