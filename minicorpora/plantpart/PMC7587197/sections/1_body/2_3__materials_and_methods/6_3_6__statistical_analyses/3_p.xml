<p>The analyses were completed using the mixed procedure of SAS [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-25-04631" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Since the effect of cultivar was significant (
 <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05) or marginally significant (0.05 ≤ 
 <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.1) on most of the constituents, further multiple means comparison was completed using the lsmeans statement of Proc Mixed (equivalent to Fisher’s least significant difference [LSD]) at 5% level of significance and letter groupings were generated. The overall mean was calculated for the constituents where cultivar effect was not significant. For the antimicrobial activities, cultivar effect was highly significant (
 <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.01) on all nine activities, and considering the large number (14) of cultivars and accessions compared, multiple means comparison was done using Tukey’s multiple range test, which controls the Type II experiment-wise error rate.
