<p>The EO of the wild hemp had a significantly higher concentration of THC relative to the one from the registered EU cultivars of industrial hemp breeding lines. In addition, it was interesting to see that wild hemp had a higher concentration of CBD in the EO relative to the EO from a strain grown for commercial production of CBD in the USA Therefore, wild hemp collected in Serbia could be used for the development of varieties (registered cultivars) with specific desirable chemical composition, and may also provide excellent material for the selection and breeding of hemp cultivars with high CBD for the commercial production of CBD and other high-value chemicals.</p>
