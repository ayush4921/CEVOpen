<p>The results from this study demonstrated that the essential oil (EO) of wild hemp from Serbia is different in its chemical profile and bioactivity from the EO of registered industrial hemp cultivars, the breeding lines, and the hemp strain grown for CBD production in North America. Wild hemp EOs were also somewhat different from the EO profile of wild and spontaneous hemps collected in Austria and Hungary, as reported in the literature. However, although having been named differently, the wild hemp in this study, the wild hemp collected in Austria, and the spontaneous hemp from Hungary might have common origins; the collection sites were approximately in the same region (with a dimeter of approximately 500 km) although collected in three different countries. These wild/spontaneous hemps have been exposed to significant environmental and agricultural (pesticide) pressure over the last few decades. These populations may all belong to 
 <italic>Cannabis sativa</italic> var. 
 <italic>spontanea</italic> Vavilov, (a synonym of 
 <italic>Cannabis sativa</italic> L.), considered native to Central and Eastern Europe and parts of Asia. However, the taxonomy of hemp is still debatable and there is no consensus among taxonomists as to whether it is a single species with several subspecies or multiple species.
