 <xref rid="bib91" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. (1993)</xref> studied 
 <italic>in-vivo</italic> efficacy of emodin in two types of experimental infections, namely that caused by subcutaneous injection of 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> in BALB/c mice and the one due to intravaginal inoculation of the parasites in mice. The appearance of subcutaneous abscess induced by injection of trichomonads was delayed by emodin treatment. An oral administration also cured the trichomonal abscesses, indicating good absorption of emodin anthraquinone. Oral treatment with emodin significantly decreased the number of trichomonads in the vagina as well. This activity's criteria were determined according to living trichomonads in isolated vagina obtained from the treated mice.
