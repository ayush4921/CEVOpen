 <xref rid="bib90" ref-type="bibr">Wacther et al. (2014)</xref> studied the effectiveness of curcumin in various concentrations against 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic>. The group also studied the efficacy of curcumin in metronidazole-resistant strains of 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> (
 <xref rid="bib90" ref-type="bibr">Wachter et al., 2014</xref>). Curcumin eradicated 100% 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> cells at the concentration of 400 μg/mL in 24 h. The EC
 <sub>50</sub> ranged from 73.0 to 105.8 μg/mL, while the EC
 <sub>90</sub> from 164.9 to 216.3 μg/mL. Although in comparison to metronidazole, curcumin was found to be effective at a higher concentration, curcumin is well tolerated without any side effects in contrast to metronidazole. The safety of curcumin is well established and demonstrated. However, these concentrations are very high, even to a natural compound that the authors presented without toxicity. As demonstrated by 
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Cos et al. (2006)</xref>, endpoints, such as IC50, higher than 100 μg/mL for extract and 25 μM for isolated compounds, should not be considered promising.
