<p id="p0190">The same group (
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Giordani et al., 2010b</xref>) studied the effects of both lycorine and candimine alkaloids on the 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> NTPDase and ecto-5′-nucleotidase activities. When both alkaloids were added directly to the reaction mixture, no effect on ATP, ADP, or AMP hydrolysis could be observed. In contrast, 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> NTPDase, and ecto-5′-nucleotidase activities were significantly inhibited by candimine and lycorine after 24 h treatment. Expressive inhibition by lycorine and candimine on this enzymatic cascade in 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> modulates the extracellular ATP and adenosine levels. The accumulation of extracellular nucleotides, mainly the cytotoxic and proinflammatory ATP due to alkaloids inhibition, plus the ATP originated from host cells, associated to reduced concentrations of the immune-modulatory adenosine, might contribute to an increased susceptibility of 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> to host immune response in the presence of lycorine and candimine (
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Giordani et al., 2010b</xref>). The fact that ecto-nucleotidases have an external location are implicated in parasite survival and are widely distributed among different eukaryotic human pathogens make them interesting targets for the development of antimicrobial agents. This study claimed a new pharmacological potential of two Amaryllidaceae alkaloids, lycorine, and candimine against 
 <italic>T. vaginalis.</italic>
