 <italic>Poincianella</italic> (
 <italic>Caesalpinia</italic>) 
 <italic>microphylla,</italic> a plant found in Brazilian Caatinga. The crude aqueous extract was successively extracted with different ratios of the water-methanol mixture. The main compounds identified were hydrolyzable tannins like gallotanins and ellagitannis. Procyanidin dimer, epicatechin, ellagic acid, and 
 <italic>O</italic>-(digalloyl) quinic acid were also identified. Tannins enriched fractions presented anti-trichomonas activity.
