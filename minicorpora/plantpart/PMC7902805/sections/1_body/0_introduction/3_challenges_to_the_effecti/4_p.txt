0: On a different but serious note, trichomonads are evolving and losing strict host specificity;  T. vaginalis-like isolates from cases of epidemic avian trichomoniasis exemplify the importance to create awareness of potential human-to-bird transfer and evolution and origins of these pathogens ( Maritz et al., 2014).
1: Cross infection of parasites between pigs and cattle has also been observed ( Miller et al., 2017).
2: Trichomonad parasites, which were known to infect animals, are now causing infection to humans as well.
3: Although rare, human tritrichomoniasis caused by  T. foetus has been reported as opportunistic infections in immunocompromised or immunosuppressed individuals ( Suzuki et al., 2016).
4: T. foetus is also found in the stomach, caecum, and nasal cavity of pigs without apparent clinical significance ( Mueller et al., 2015).
