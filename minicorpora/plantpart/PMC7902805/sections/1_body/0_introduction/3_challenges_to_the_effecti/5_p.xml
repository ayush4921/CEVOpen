<p id="p0050">This report's objective was to collate the literature on activity against 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> of isolated natural products and whole plant products. Several reviews have analyzed medicinal plants' efficacy and safety, their extracts, or isolated plant constituents for treating 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> infection. However, the results of systematic reviews are not consistent, and the methodological quality of systematic reviews is unknown. No overview focused on the efficacy and safety of several plant species. This study aimed to summarize the evidence from reviews and systematic reviews that evaluated the effectiveness of various plants and their isolated constituents in treating trichomonas infection and critically assessing the evidence's quality.
