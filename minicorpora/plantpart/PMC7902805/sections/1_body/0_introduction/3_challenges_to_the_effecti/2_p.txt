0: Although curable, trichomoniasis and its treatment are often challenging because of the drug's side effects.
1: Generally, adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, constipation, cramping, and metallic taste.
2: Other adverse effects include peripheral neuropathy, seizures, fatigue, dizziness, headache, and leukopenia ( Wendel and Workowski, 2007).
3: Additionally, trichomonas is increasingly associated with other health complications like pelvic inflammatory disease and cervical cancer.
4: Preterm births, low birth weights, stillbirth, neonatal death, sexual transmission, and acquisition of HIV infection are strongly associated with trichomoniasis ( Hirt et al., 2011).
5: HIV-positive women may require multiple doses of metronidazole because of changes in vaginal ecology, interference of impaired immunity with single-dose treatment, and interaction of antiretroviral drugs with metronidazole ( Kissinger and Adamski, 2013).
6: In men's case,  T. vaginalis infections are also associated with chronic prostatitis leading to aggressive prostate cancers, as observed from increased Prostate-Specific Antigen levels ( Langston et al., 2019;  Suitcliffe et al., 2006).
