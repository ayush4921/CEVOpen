0: Even though the single metronidazole therapy has a failure rate of only 10%, these figures are significant due to the large number of patients suffering from trichomoniasis.
1: Although oral 5-nitroimidazoles such as metronidazole and tinidazole exhibit high cure rates, trichomonas infection can still be highly persistent and recurrent ( Dunne et al., 2003;  Sena et al., 2014).
2: One of the major reasons for this is the drug resistance to metronidazole or cross-resistance to other 5-nitroimidazoles or, in some cases, multiple drug resistance ( Dunne et al., 2003).
3: Additionally, in certain cases, metronidazole-associated allergy may cause urticaria, facial edema, and anaphylactic shock.
4: It may result in therapy failure as well ( Mehriardestani et al., 2017).
5: Drug resistance to metronidazole or the whole 5-nitroimidazole family is fairly common, which eventually exposes the lack of drugs available in the armamentarium to treat trichomonas infection.
6: Given the population density that suffers from trichomonas infection and lack of drugs, there is an urgent need to discover safe and efficacious drugs to treat trichomonosis.
