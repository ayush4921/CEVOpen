0: Five species of trichomonads infect humans.
1: They are  Trichomonas vaginalis, found in the urogenital tract;  Trichomonas tenax, localized in the oral cavity;  Pentatrichomonas hominis; Tetratrichomonas sp , in the respiratory tract of humans ( Dong et al., 2019) and digestive tract of several animals ( Cepicka et al., 2006).
2: and  Dientamoeba fragilis, both found in the digestive tract ( Maritz et al., 2014).
3: P. hominis and  D. fragilis cause gastrointestinal symptoms like abdominal pain and diarrhea, and infect domestic animals like cats and farm mammals, demonstrating non-human selectivity and zoonotic origin.
4: Additionally, trichomonad species causing infections in birds and animals, and thus having veterinary importance, are  Trichomonas gallinae,  Tetratrichomonas gallinarum, and  Histomonas meleagridis, and  Tritrichomonas foetus ( Amin et al., 2014).
