0: Treatment of trichomoniasis, for the last several decades, involves 5-nitroimidazoles, e.g., metronidazole, tinidazole, ornidazole, and nimorazole.
1: Metronidazole low-dose vaginal preparations are not effective for trichomoniasis; hence high-dose vaginal suppositories are used.
2: The male partner(s) should also be treated simultaneously, even if asymptomatic.
3: Metronidazole or tinidazole 2 g orally as a single dose of metronidazole 500 mg orally twice daily for seven days is the treatment option.
4: Based on the observations of a multicentre, open-label, randomized controlled trial in women positive for  T. vaginalis infection, 7-days low dose metronidazole is recommended as a primary treatment ( Kissinger et al., 2018).
5: Single-dose is less effective and is associated with side effects than the 1-week treatment, and it is preferred because of patient compliance and lower cost of therapy ( Sena et al., 2014).
6: T. tenax is morphologically close to  T. vaginalis and is sensitive to anti-parasitic treatment with tinidazole ( Kurnatowska and Kurnatowski, 1999) as  T. vaginalis ( Butt and Tirmizi, 2018).
