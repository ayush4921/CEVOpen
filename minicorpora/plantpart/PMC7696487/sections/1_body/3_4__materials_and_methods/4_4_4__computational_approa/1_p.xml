<p>Interactions between the natural compounds and human peroxiredoxin 5 were assessed by in silico molecular docking, in order to explore the preferred orientation of the ligands in the binding site of receptors. The crystal structure was obtained from the Protein Data Bank: human peroxiredoxin 5 (PDB Code: 1HD2). All water molecules were removed, as was the co-crystallized ligand from the structures. Polar hydrogens and Gasteiger charges were assigned with AutoDockTools1.5.2 (ADT), and the PDBQT file format was prepared [
 <xref rid="B57-plants-09-01534" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The same software was used to select a docking grid. In human peroxiredoxin 5 enzyme (PDB: 1HD2), the grid box site was established at 7.611, 43.828, and 29.921Å (
 <italic>x</italic>, 
 <italic>y</italic>, and 
 <italic>z</italic>, respectively) using a grid of 70, 58, and 58 points (
 <italic>x</italic>, 
 <italic>y</italic>, and 
 <italic>z</italic>, respectively) and including a spacing of 0.375 Å.
