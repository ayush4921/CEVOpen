<p>The DPPH test was carried out as described by Felhi et al. [
 <xref rid="B56-plants-09-01534" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. A series of dilutions was prepared from the 
 <italic>P. cubeba</italic> fruitâ€™s essential oil solution, each one supplemented with 1 mL of the ethanolic solution of DPPH. Then, the dilutions were incubated for 30 min in the dark, and the absorbance of the mixtures was measured at 517 nm against a negative control treated under the same conditions. Ascorbic acid (AA) was used in this test as the positive control.
