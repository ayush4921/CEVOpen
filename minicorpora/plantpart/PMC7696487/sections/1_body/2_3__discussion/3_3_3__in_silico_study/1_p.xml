<p>Computational methods associated with experimental strategies have been of great value in modern drug design, and in the development and discovery of novel promising compounds. Our docking results were also well-correlated with in vitro antioxidant assays, along with the selected phytocompounds interacting perfectly with the protein target. Indeed, in addition to methyleugenol and eugenol, which are discussed above, the natural bicyclic sesquiterpene β-caryophyllene oxide has been proven to have potent antioxidant activity [

 <italic>Lobophytum compactum</italic> and 
 <italic>Lobophytum crissum</italic>, and has been reported to have potential antioxidant activity [

 <italic>Alpinia galangal</italic> extract rich α-selinene (called also α-Eudesma-3,11-diene) possesses potent antioxidant activity. Viridiflorol, as an oxygenated sesquiterpenes, was found to possess antioxidant properties [
