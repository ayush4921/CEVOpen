<p>The results prove that 
 <italic>P. cubeba</italic> fruit’s essential oil is able to act as a donor of hydrogen atoms or electrons to reduce the DPPH radical. The potent DPPH scavenging activity of 
 <italic>P. cubeba</italic> fruit’s essential oil could be attributed to the high amount of eugenol and methyleugenol [

 <xref rid="B41-plants-09-01534" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] showed that eugenol had the most powerful antioxidant activity and radical-scavenging activity compared to the standards: butylated hydroxyanisole, butylated hydroxytoluene, α-tocopherol, and Trolox. Recently, Gogoi et al. [
 <xref rid="B39-plants-09-01534" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] reported that methyleugenol-rich lemongrass essential oil displayed the strongest antioxidant activity on DPPH assay, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.263 μg/mL, which is lower than standard ascorbic acid (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.58 μg/mL). Also, other compounds in small amounts contribute to the scavenging activity, such as oxygenated sesquiterpenes [
