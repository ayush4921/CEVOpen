<p>Thirteen kinds of edible vegetable oils, including low erucic acid rapeseed oil, soybean oil, peanut oil, sunflower seed oil, flaxseed oil, edible blend oil (edible blend oil is a mixture oil with two or more kinds of oil, which is also a type of vegetable oil), olive oil, palm oil, corn oil, camellia oil, peony seed oil, sacha inchi oil, and sesame oil, were selected for evaluation, according to the data provided by the 2016 China Food Composition Tables

 </sup> and several other studies. Erucic acid is a long-chain MUFA. The long-term consumption of rapeseed oil rich in erucic acid will cause the excessive accumulation of this compound, leading to the thickening of blood vessel walls and the deposition of cardiac fat.

 </sup> Therefore, to better meet human health requirements, China began to research on the effect of low erucic acid and low glucosinolate rape around 1980. After 2000, China began to promote and apply it on a large scale. The Chinese national standard for rapeseed oil and the industry standard for low erucic acid rapeseed oil respectively stipulate that the erucic acid in rapeseed oil should be lower than total fat contents of 3 and 5%. At present, Chinese rapeseed oil is low in erucic acid. Therefore, it was decided to use the low erucic acid rapeseed oil data for model verification.
