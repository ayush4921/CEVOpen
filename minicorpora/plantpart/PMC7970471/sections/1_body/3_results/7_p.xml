<p>Rapeseed oil has a low linolenic acid content and cannot be adjusted sufficiently within a certain intake range. Peony seed oil and sacha inchi oil are new food resources approved by the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China, and both have higher α-linolenic acid levels. Therefore, appropriately increasing the intake of peony seed oil and sacha inchi oil is beneficial for modifying the current dietary pattern exhibiting an n-6/n-3 PUFA imbalance.</p>
