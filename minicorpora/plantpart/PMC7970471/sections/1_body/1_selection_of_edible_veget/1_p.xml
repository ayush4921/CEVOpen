<p>Because the nutritional components of edible vegetable oils are complex, research cannot only focus on a single characteristic. However, because it is not possible to simultaneously include all components in the evaluation scope, it is necessary to reasonably select the evaluation indexes. The fatty acids in edible vegetable oils can be divided into SFA, MUFA, and PUFA. Fatty acids can form triacylglycerols with glycerin, commonly known as fats, which can provide and store energy for the body, promote the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, and maintain constant body temperature. The human body can synthesize many kinds of fatty acids on its own. However, the linoleic acid and α-linolenic acid in PUFA, which are essential to the human body, cannot be naturally synthesized and are derived via food consumption. Vitamins can be divided into those that are water-soluble and those that are fat-soluble. Neither of these constitutes the body’s structural components and do not provide energy, but their metabolites can participate in the body’s many metabolic or apoptotic processes. These vitamins can generally not be synthesized by the body and must be derived from food. Fat-soluble vitamin E, which is required for daily human physiological activities, is mainly derived from edible vegetable oil, where germ oil is especially abundant. Edible vegetable oil is also rich in phytosterols, providing an excellent way for humans to ingest these compounds. Phytosterols in the diet can decrease total serum cholesterol, as well as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and is beneficially related to decrease the incidence of certain cancers.</p>
