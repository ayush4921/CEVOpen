<p>PUFA refers to straight-chain fatty acids containing two or more double bonds with a carbon chain length of 18 to 22 carbon atoms and mainly includes n-3 and n-6 PUFAs. Linoleic acid is an n-6 PUFA with two double bonds that can reduce the risk of a coronary heart disease by lowering LDL-C

 </sup> Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is an isomer of linoleic acid with anticancer and antiatherosclerotic properties, and it can enhance body immunity, regulate fat metabolism, and promote bone tissue metabolism.

 </sup> It is an essential unsaturated fatty acid that cannot be synthesized by the human body. α-Linolenic is the precursor of a series of metabolites under the action of desaturase and elongase, the most important of which are eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).

 </sup> EPA and DHA are unsaturated fatty acids that cannot be synthesized by the body and can only be obtained from food sources such as fish, shellfish, crustaceans, and microalgae. Studies have shown that EPA and DHA can reduce the mortality rate associated with the coronary heart disease and at different doses have been shown to decrease the risk of coronary artery death from 10 to 30%
