<p>The SFA, MUFA, and PUFA contained in edible oils vary in type, content, and ratio. Although SFA is commonly found in the fats of animals, such as beef, mutton, and pork, they are also present in plant oils such as coconut oil, cocoa oil, and palm oil. SFAs commonly found in edible vegetable oils are palmitic acid and stearic acid. It is generally believed that SFA in the diet may increase the level of serum LDL-C by inhibiting its receptor activity, resulting in the deposition of cholesterol on the inner walls of arterial blood vessels and increasing the body’s susceptibility to various types of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs).
