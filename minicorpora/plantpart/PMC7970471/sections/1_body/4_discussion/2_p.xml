 </sup> In terms of nutritional evaluation, as mentioned above, the current focus is on the type, content, and proper proportion of fatty acids in edible vegetable oil. Additionally, during the nutritional analysis process, the comparison and description sentences are often used to characterize the nutritional properties of edible vegetable oil, thus dividing the two concepts of body demand and food supply. However, it is challenging to perform a complete evaluation of edible vegetable oil only by comparing several nutrient contents. The impact of various components in edible vegetable oil on human health can only be highlighted in combination with the needs of the body or authoritative recommendation.
