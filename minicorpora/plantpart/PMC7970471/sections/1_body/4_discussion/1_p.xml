<p>This article is based on the 2013 China Dietary Reference Intake, and after thoroughly studying the fatty acid intake of Chinese residents, a reasonable range of daily per capita consumption of edible vegetable oils was determined (a recommended daily intake of 20 g). Furthermore, to establish the model, the nutritional characteristics of edible vegetable oils as well as Chinaâ€™s recommended intake values regarding fatty acids, vitamin E, and phytosterols were examined. The scoring results mainly indicate whether each evaluation index in the edible vegetable oil meets the reference intake requirements. More importantly, the scoring result level only represents the degree of satisfaction and does not directly reflect the level of its nutritional value. However, the reference intake of dietary nutrients is revised by the Chinese Nutrition Society (CNS), according to the nutritional survey data and dietary characteristics of Chinese residents. Based on the Chinese Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) and referring to foreign DRI documents, CNS revised the current DRIs, including the estimated average requirement (EAR), recommended nutrient intake (RNI), adequate intake (AI), and tolerable upper intake level (UL), reflecting the reasonable dietary pattern that Chinese residents should be following. Therefore, to a certain extent, the model reflects whether the indexes of the fatty acids, vitamin E, and phytosterols in the edible vegetable oil can meet the daily intake levels required by the human body.</p>
