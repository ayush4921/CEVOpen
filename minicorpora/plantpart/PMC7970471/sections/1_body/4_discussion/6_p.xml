 </sup> shows that the per capita daily intake of Chinese freshwater fish is about 15 g, the ingestion of marine fish is about 5.9 g, while the consumption of shrimp and crab is about 2.8 g. In some inland areas, the consumption of seafood will obviously be less. Such a diet can easily lead to insufficient intake of EPA and DHA. Also, α-linolenic acid can be converted into EPA under the catalysis of △–6 dehydrogenase, elongase, △–5 dehydrogenase, and other enzymes, and then it can be transformed to DHA by β-oxidation.
