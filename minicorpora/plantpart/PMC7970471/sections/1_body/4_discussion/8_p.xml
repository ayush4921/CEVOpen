<p>The olive oil score in this model was 3, which was the same as camellia oil and slightly higher than palm oil. Therefore, except for MUFA, the remaining fatty acid content in olive oil did not meet the recommended fatty acid intake requirements in China. Furthermore, the model employed in this study used the total amount of vitamin E as an evaluation index. Therefore, it did not separately distinguish the respective activities of α-, β-, γ-, δ-tocopherol and tocotrienol of which α-tocopherol is the most active form of vitamin E in the body,
