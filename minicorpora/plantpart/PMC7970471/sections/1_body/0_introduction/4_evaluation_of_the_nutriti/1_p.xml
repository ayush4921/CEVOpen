<p>The various ingredients in edible vegetable oil all have their respective functions during the process of human physiological metabolism. For example, n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) play a critical role in promoting the health of the brain and retina. Î±-Linolenic acid, which belongs to n-3 fatty acids, has physiological functions such as antiatherosclerostic, prevention of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, weight loss, and lowering blood lipids. It can be converted into long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids DHA and EPA in the human body, increasing the levels of DHA and EPA in most tissues and exerting similar physiological functions as that of DHA and EPA.
