<p>An examination of perilla oil, almond oil, and hemp seed oil found that the linoleic acid content was the highest in the hemp seed oil, α-linolenic content was the highest in perilla oil, and MUFA content was the highest in almond oil. The characteristic fatty acids in the three types of edible vegetable oils were all different, displaying a variety of contents.

 </sup> Several studies compared the fatty acid composition of olive oil, camellia oil, peanut oil, rapeseed oil, and soybean oil in which the content was analyzed. Results indicated that both olive oil and camellia oil were rich in n-9 fatty acids; peanut oil, olive oil, and camellia oil were low in n-3 fatty acids; and peanut oil and soybean oil contained high levels of n-6 fatty acids. From a nutritional perspective, edible vegetable oil rich in n-9 fatty acids, i.e., oleic acid is not suitable for single long-term, uninterrupted consumption because it is not an essential fatty acid according to Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs), and prolonged ingestion will result in an insufficient intake of essential fatty acids.

 </sup> Sacha inchi oil represented a new type of vegetable oil whose fatty acid, phytosterol, and vitamin E content were compared with that of common edible vegetable oils. The results indicated that the α-linolenic acid and phytosterol levels were 43.62% and 265.61 mg/100 g, respectively, which exceeded the corresponding levels in common edible vegetable oils.

 </sup> The calories, SFA content, n-6/n-3 ratio, and vitamin E content of rapeseed oil, soybean oil, peanut oil, rapeseed oil, cottonseed oil, corn oil, and palm oil were also determined. Except for soybean oil, sunflower oil, and cottonseed oil, the ratio of polyunsaturated and vitamin E content was ideal in the rest of the plant oils. Therefore, edible vegetable oil exhibiting sufficient levels of fatty acid saturation, n-6/n-3 ratio, and appropriate vitamin E content should be selected to adequately fulfill human dietary requirements.
