0: Edible vegetable oil forms a vital part of the human diet and can provide the energy and fatty acids needed by the body and promote the digestion and absorption of fat-soluble vitamins.
1: With the improvement of peoples living standards, Chinas per capita consumption of vegetable oil remains at a high level.
2: According to data provided by the first volume of 2013 Report on the Nutrition and Health Status of Chinese Residents, 1 the average daily fat intake of Chinese urban and rural residents is 79.7 g, while the 2013 China Dietary Reference Intake-Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges 2 suggests that the total fat intake from the diet should be 2030% of the total energy intake.
3: If the daily energy intake per person is calculated to be 2000 kcal, the total daily fat intake per capita should be 44.466.7 g. However, the current total daily fat intake per capita in China is substantially higher than the recommended value.
4: The top five food sources for fat are edible oils (50.1%), animal meat (22.5%), flour (6.4%), others (5.7%), and eggs (3.3%).
5: Edible vegetable oil provides about 50% of the total dietary fat, which is equivalent to about 39 g of edible vegetable oil per day,of which the top three edible vegetable oils are rapeseed oil (12.8%), peanut oil (7.4%), and soybean oil (6.5%).
6: 1 The 2016 Chinese Dietary Guide 3 recommends a daily consumption of edible oil per person of 2530 g. However, the real daily intake is far higher than this guide.
7: 1 Many research studies suggest that the primary fatty acids in edible vegetable oil are palmitic acid (C16:0), stearic acid (C18:0), oleic acid (C18:1), and linoleic acid (C18:2) of which oleic acid and linoleic acid display the highest levels.
8: 4 However, rapeseed oil, peanut oil, and soybean oil are high in oleic acid and linoleic acid, and maintaining a prolonged diet pattern high in linoleic acid leads to excessive intake of omega-6, damaging the balance between n-6 and n-3PUFAs.
9: Although the intake of aquatic products and seafood in the coastal areas may be adequate to increase the n-3 levels, it remains too low in some inland regions.
10: The average intake of fish per person per day in China is about 23 g, which is lower than the 4070 g/d recommended by the 2016 Chinese Dietary Guide .3 The content and proportion of fatty acid intake are closely related to human health.
11: Consuming an appropriate amount of fatty acids is conducive to the normal metabolism of fat, while excessive ingestion leads to the deposition of fat in the body, resulting in hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and other diseases.
