<p>The content of five major fatty acids in corn oil, sunflower oil, soybean oil, tea oil, rapeseed oil, and peanut oil were compared and indicated that the average unsaturated fatty acid content in all types of edible vegetable oils exceeded 80%, while that of SFA was about 10%.

 </sup> Further experiments compared the vitamin E content in nine edible vegetable oils (138 different brands), showing that it ranged from 5.9 to 1246.6 mg/kg, with an average of 652.4 mg/kg. The vitamin E level was the highest in first-grade soybean oil, ranging from 804.5 to 1246.6 mg/kg.

 </sup> Measuring the phytosterol content, such as campesterol, stigmasterol, rapeseed sterol, and β-sitosterol in 56 edible vegetable oils and 7 edible blend oils, indicated that all of them contained only two of the four sterols, β-sitosterol and campesterol. Of the tested oils, corn oil and rapeseed oil exhibited the highest total sterol content, with averages of 8916.6 and 8811.1 μg/g, respectively.
