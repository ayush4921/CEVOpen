<p>MUFA is widely found in food, such as nuts, vegetable oils, meat, and dairy products and primarily includes palmitoleic acid and oleic acid, which are abundant in common edible vegetable oils. Evidence shows that instead of carbohydrates, it can increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, and by replacing SFA, especially atherosclerotic fatty acids, it can reduce the ratio of (LDL + total cholesterol)/HDL. Based on the recommended intake of MUFA = total fatty acid intake (%E) – SFA (%E) – PUFA (%E) – trans fatty acids (%E), the maximum amount is between 7–17 %E.

 </sup> A meta-analysis found that in two groups with six months of high and low MUFA (&lt;12 %E) ingestion, respectively, the higher group (MUFA &gt;12 %E) significantly decreases the blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure of the high consumption group.
