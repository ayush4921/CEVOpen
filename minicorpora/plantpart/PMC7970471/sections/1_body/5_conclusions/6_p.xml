<p>In conclusion, this study established a preliminary model to evaluate the nutritional quality of fatty acids for 13 kinds of edible vegetable oils in the Chinese market. Among them, peony seed oil, flaxseed oil, low erucic acid rapeseed oil, and edible blend oil had the highest score of 7. Palm oil had the lowest score of 2. However, the model established in this paper only considers fatty acids as a nutritional component. From the perspective of fatty acid evaluation, people can get more balanced fatty acids from edible vegetable oils with a higher score. However, as mentioned above, although olive oil has a low score, it has a high content of vitamin E, low saturated fatty acids (2â€“21%), and high antioxidant phenols. Therefore, in daily dietary consumption, consumers can try to choose edible vegetable oils with a higher score easily because edible vegetable oils with a higher score can provide more balanced fatty acids. But at the same time, vegetable oil is only a food material, and the final dietary structure has more influence on human health. Therefore, consumers also need to pay attention that different kinds of vegetable oils have different effects. Although some edible vegetable oils may have a lower score, such as olive oil, they may provide other nutrients. Therefore, in addition to edible vegetable oils with a high score, we also could eat various kinds of edible vegetable oils at the same time, which will be more conducive to improving the current fatty acid diet structure in China.</p>
