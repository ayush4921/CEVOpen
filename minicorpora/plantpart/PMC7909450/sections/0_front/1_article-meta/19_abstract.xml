 <p>Essential oils are used in an increasing number of applications including biopesticides. Their volatility minimizes the risk of residue but can also be a constraint if the release is rapid and uncontrolled. Solutions allowing the encapsulation of essential oils are therefore strongly researched. In this study, essential oils encapsulation was carried out within dendrimers to control their volatility. Indeed, a spontaneous complexation occurs in a solution of dendrimers with essential oils which maintains it longer. Six parameters (temperature, stirring rate, relative concentration, solvent volume, stirring time, and pH) of this reaction has been optimized by two steps: first a screening of the parameters that influence the encapsulation with a Plackett–Burmann design the most followed by an optimization of those ones by a surface response methodology. In this study, two essential oils with herbicide properties were used: the essential oils of 
  <italic>Cinnamomum zeylanicum</italic> Blume and 
  <italic>Cymbopogon winterianus</italic> Jowitt; and four biosourced dendrimers: glycerodendrimers derived from polypropylenimine and polyamidoamine, a glyceroclikdendrimer, and a glyceroladendrimer. Meta-analysis of all Plackett–Burman assays determined that rate and stirring time were effective on the retention rate thereby these parameters were used for the surface response methodology part. Each combination gives a different optimum depending on the structure of these molecules.
