<p>In the context of the use of dendrimer-EOs formulations as biopesticide, it is essential to go further in the study of the encapsulation rate with a dynamic study of the release of EOs by the dendrimer. It is also worthwhile to determine the stability and biological effects of the new biosourced herbicide formulation. In addition, it would be relevant to study with a more fundamental point of view the encapsulation of the selected pure compounds from EO like trans-cinnamaldehyde within GD-PPI-3 to better understand the interactions between EO constituent and dendrimer particularly through NMR studies. This work is in progress.</p>
