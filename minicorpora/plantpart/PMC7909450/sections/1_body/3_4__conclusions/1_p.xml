<p>For the first time, essential oils encapsulation by bio-sourced dendrimers was successfully carried out, and this reaction was optimized using PBD and RSM. The first part proved that only the rate and the time of stirring influenced the retention rate among the six factors analyzed. The second part optimizes both factors for each couple dendrimer/EO and resulted in very different results. This is quite understandable considering the apolar nature of the EOs’ constituents and the differences of structure between dendrimers. Indeed, we can see in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00207-f001">Figure 1</xref> that even if all dendrimers contain glycerol or glycerol derivatives in the intern structure or on the periphery of the dendrimer, and a polar surface, the properties of the cores are different. On one point, the core of GD-PAMAM-2 is more polar than the GD-PPI-3′s one; on another point, some have strong steric hindrance and important electronic charge (GCD-2) while others are less energy-intensive (GAD-1). Previous study about encapsulation by dendrimers showed that the hydrodynamic radius of GD-PPI and GD-PAMAM influenced the encapsulation and that one occurred at the core level of dendrimers rather than at its periphery. Metal complexes were successfully encapsulated in the fourth and fifth generation of GD-PPI (around 25% of encapsulation rate), but not in the third probably because this one had a smaller hydrodynamic radius (2.81 nm) [

 <xref rid="foods-10-00207-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>), one of the major compounds responsible of herbicidal activity, is a smaller molecule than the previous encapsulated ones, it seems obvious that smaller dendrimer generations give here the best results for its encapsulation. Furthermore, this α,β-unsaturated aldehyde presents an important electronic density as the previous organic compounds used. It must be pointed out that chromatographic profiles were similar, for EOs encapsulated in dendrimers or not (control) which suggests that all compounds of each EOs were encapsulated in the same way (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00207-f003">Figure 3</xref>). It can be concluded that first the size of molecules encapsulated in comparison with size of intern cavities of dendrimers, and secondly the amount of free electron in the EOs (aromatic circle and double bonds promotes electrostatic interactions) appear to be principal factors influencing the EOs encapsulation within dendrimers [
