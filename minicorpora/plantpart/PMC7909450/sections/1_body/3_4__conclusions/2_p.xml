<p>In the optimized conditions, the best encapsulation rates varied from 5 to 40% depending on the dendrimer-EO combination (
 <xref rid="foods-10-00207-t008" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref>). The combination of GD-PPI-3 with cinnamon EO leads to the most promising results with an r = 40% when the stirring is long (6 h) and strong (1735 rpm). As there is no other study on encapsulation of EOs within GDs yet, comparing these results with previous results is not possible. However a comparison with other encapsulations techniques can be done: for example, dendrimers have a better encapsulation rate than the powder optimized by Huynh T. V. et al. who obtained 18% as optimum EO concentration [

On the opposite, the rate of encapsulation is quite lower than encapsulation by coacervation in gelatin optimized by Sutaphanit P. and Chitprasert P. (66.5 to 98.4%) but the release from these capsules is almost impossible (stable for 18 months storage) [
