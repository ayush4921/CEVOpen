<p>Essential oils encapsulation take place by a spontaneous complexation; the dendrimers were dissolved in H
 <sub>2</sub>O (8 mL) and EOs were dissolved in ethanol (various concentrations). EOs solutions or pure ethanol was added to dendrimers solution (3/1

 <italic>v</italic>) in a 22 mL glass vial which was directly hermetically sealed with a Teflon cap and covered with an aluminum foil to avoid light interference. Solutions were then stirred for at least 10 min at 100 rpm. According on the stirring settings, an emulsion of EOs occurs in the dendrimer solution, which provides a liquid phase EOs retention. This retention leads to a change in dynamic balance between solution and headspace compared to free EO solution (control), which is quantified by the following analysis.
