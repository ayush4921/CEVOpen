<p>Based on the results of the PDB design, only the most influential parameters on the encapsulation reaction have been selected for further optimization through response surface methodology. Experiments were performed according to a design with two parameters and three levels for each parameter [
 <xref rid="B25-foods-10-00207" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Two blocks have been used to cover the potential heterogeneity during the course of the experiment. The selected independent variables were stirring rate (R) and stirring duration (D). The experimental design in the actual levels is shown in 
 <xref rid="foods-10-00207-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. As for PBD, variations in retention rate between each couple dendrimers-EOs were recorded. In RSM experimental results (
