<p>For each combination, a 12-run PBD was applied to evaluate six factors. Each variable was examined at two levels: â€“1 for the low level and +1 for the high level. 
 <xref rid="foods-10-00207-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> illustrates these parameters and the corresponding levels used. The values of two levels were set according to our previous preliminary experimental results. In 
 <xref rid="foods-10-00207-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, representing PBD and experimental results, data listed indicate the variations in retention rate between each combination of dendrimers-Eos, depending on the treatment. Negative values indicated that the opposite effect is observed: presence of dendrimers increase the volatility of EOs.
