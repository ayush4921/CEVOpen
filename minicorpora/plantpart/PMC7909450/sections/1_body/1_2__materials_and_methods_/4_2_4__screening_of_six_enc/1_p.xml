<p>Plackettâ€“Burman design was used to select the significant parameters for essential oils encapsulation. This design was applied to four combinations of dendrimers and EOs previously selected owing to their noticeable essential oil retention capacity (preliminary assays, data not shown but published soon). The combinations are: GD-PPI-3/CAN EO, GD-PAMAM-2/CIT EO, GAD-1/CAN EO, GCD-1/CIT EO. The independent parameters were set on the basis of those preliminary analyses, which considered the properties of the dendrimers for relative concentration and pH, the technical feasibility for rate of stirring, the solvent volume, and stirring time and the temperature which can be found in realistic agronomical conditions.</p>
