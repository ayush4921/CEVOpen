<p>The percentage of retention (r) of EOs by GDs was determined by dynamic head- space sampling (DHS, Gerstel, Germany) coupled to a thermal desorption unit (TDU, Gerstel, Germany), a gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies 7890A), and a mass spectrometer (MS, Agilent Technologies 5975C). During treatment in the DHS unit, the vials were conditioned at 25 °C for 30 min with stirring (500 rpm). The head-space sampling was performed on Gerstel TDU desorption tubes (OD 6.00 mm, filled with 60 mg of Tenax TA, Gerstel, Germany), on 200 mL at 20 mL/min, followed by 200 mL at 60 mL/min of drying phase. Desorption then occurred for 10 min at 300 °C and coupled to a cooled injection system (CIS, Gerstel, Germany) set at −80 °C. EOs were then transferred to the GC column (VF-WAXms, Agilent technologies USA; 30 m length, 0.250 mm I.D, 0.25 l m film thickness) for separation with temperature program as follow: Java citronella—from 70 °C (5 min) to 100 °C at a rate of 8 °C/min, then 2 °C/min to 160 °C, and then 20 °C/min to 260 °C (10 min); Cinnamon—from 40 °C (4 min) to 80 °C at a rate 3.5 °C/min, then 5 °C/min to 160 °C, and then 20 °C/min to 220 °C (10 min) with helium as carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min. The MS were recorded in electron ionization mode at 70 eV (scanned mass range: 35 to 300 m/z); source and quadrupole temperature at 230 °C and 150 °C respectively. The component identification was performed by comparison of the recorded spectra with two data libraries (Pal 600K
 <sup>®</sup> and Wiley275) and injection of pure commercial standards in the same chromatographic conditions.
