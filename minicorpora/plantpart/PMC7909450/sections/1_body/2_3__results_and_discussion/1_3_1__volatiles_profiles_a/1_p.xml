<p>Chromatograms obtained by DHS-GS-MS for encapsulation optimizations show the volatile profiles of both EOs in

 <xref rid="B12-foods-10-00207" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. On these figures, chromatograms of control and encapsulation solutions are overlaid which show that the only difference found is in the height (and peak area) of all compounds. Therefore, profiles were similar in the presence and absence of dendrimers. A thorough examination of the retention rate of each compound in 
 <xref rid="foods-10-00207-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> allows to observe that chemical structures and volumes of the major components of cinnamon EOs (volumes from 210 to 377 Å
 <sup>3</sup>) are more variable than in citronella EOs (volumes from 270 to 303 Å
 <sup>3</sup>), which seems to affect somewhat the profile (12% retention rate variations between eugenol and β-caryophyllene)
