<p>For the first studied combination of dendrimer/EO, initially settled parameters were not optimal to find a maximum (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00207-f004">Figure 4</xref>A) so new ones were defined in 
 <xref rid="foods-10-00207-t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00207-f005">Figure 5</xref>A shows that the model with those parameters was significant, with F-value equal to 10.34 and

 <italic>p</italic> = 0.022) the applied model presented a good fitting to the encapsulation efficiency response (
