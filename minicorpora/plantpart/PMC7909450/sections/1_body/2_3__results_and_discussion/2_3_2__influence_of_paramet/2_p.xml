<p>Analysis of PBD has been done for each couple dendrimer/EO (
 <xref rid="foods-10-00207-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>) which showed that almost no one had a variable influencing significantly the encapsulation rate (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). However, the meta-analysis of all results and a particular attention at the ranking of variables show that time and rate of stirring appeared important in the encapsulation process. Considering that, it seems the lack of significance of these results reveals that the influence had been attenuated by the variability among repetitions in the manipulations. Both parameters (duration and rate of stirring) were selected for further optimization both with RSM.
