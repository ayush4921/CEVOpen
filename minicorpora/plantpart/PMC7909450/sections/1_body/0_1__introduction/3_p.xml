<p>Cinnamon and Java citronella essential oils are of particular interest for herbicidal applications in a context where the replacement of conventional herbicides is increasingly wanted [

 <xref rid="B12-foods-10-00207" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], we determined that the major constituents in cinnamon essential oil are trans-cinnamaldehyde (70%) followed by eugenol, caryophyllene, cinnamyl acetate, and linalool in decreasing concentration order. Java citronella EO is constituted of 57 different molecules; among them citronellal (40%), geraniol (20%), citronellol (15%), limonene (5%), and eugenol (2%) are the main representatives [
