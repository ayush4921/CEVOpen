<p>The goal of this study is to optimize the encapsulation reaction of two essential oils by four selected dendrimers by maximizing the retention of two GDs, a GCD and a GAD using a Plackettâ€“Burman design (PBD) and response surface methodology (RSM) in order to eventually create an effective biosourced herbicide or for other applications where a slow release of EOs is required. PBDs are a screening design that takes into account a large number of factors with a minimal number of trials, while RSMs are an experimental design intended to optimize factors and their combinations [
