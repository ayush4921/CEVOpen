<p>Essential oils are natural mixtures of volatile compounds frequently used in cosmetics, perfume, and sanitary products for both their fragrance and biological activities [

 <xref rid="B7-foods-10-00207" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Another principal characteristic of EOs is their volatility, which limits residues after treatment. Unfortunately this can be a constraint for their utilization as biopesticide because their spread is not controlled [
 <xref rid="B8-foods-10-00207" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. To counter this, scientists developed several different encapsulation techniques. Depending on their properties, emulsion, coacervation, spray drying, complexation, ionic gelation, and nanoprecipitation help maintain a controlled release of EOs, either quick or slow [
 <xref rid="B9-foods-10-00207" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. EOs encapsulation may appear useless to enhance herbicidal activities on plants, because shoot death occurs after 1 h to 1 day of application [

However, an actual interest exists for the improvement of the seedâ€™s germination inhibition effects because this one occurs for longer periods (up to 30 days) thus EO encapsulation with controlled release allows to use a lower concentration. Lethal dose depends on the target plant/seed [
