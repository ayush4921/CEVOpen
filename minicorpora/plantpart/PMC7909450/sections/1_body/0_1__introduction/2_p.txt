0: Essential oils are natural mixtures of volatile compounds frequently used in cosmetics, perfume, and sanitary products for both their fragrance and biological activities [ 4, 5, 6, 7].
1: Another principal characteristic of EOs is their volatility, which limits residues after treatment.
2: Unfortunately this can be a constraint for their utilization as biopesticide because their spread is not controlled [ 8].
3: To counter this, scientists developed several different encapsulation techniques.
4: Depending on their properties, emulsion, coacervation, spray drying, complexation, ionic gelation, and nanoprecipitation help maintain a controlled release of EOs, either quick or slow [ 9].
5: EOs encapsulation may appear useless to enhance herbicidal activities on plants, because shoot death occurs after 1 h to 1 day of application [ 10].
6: However, an actual interest exists for the improvement of the seeds germination inhibition effects because this one occurs for longer periods (up to 30 days) thus EO encapsulation with controlled release allows to use a lower concentration.
7: Lethal dose depends on the target plant/seed [ 11].
