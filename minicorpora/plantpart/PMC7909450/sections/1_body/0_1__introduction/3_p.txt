0: Cinnamon and Java citronella essential oils are of particular interest for herbicidal applications in a context where the replacement of conventional herbicides is increasingly wanted [ 12, 13, 14].
1: In a previous study [ 12], we determined that the major constituents in cinnamon essential oil are trans-cinnamaldehyde (70%) followed by eugenol, caryophyllene, cinnamyl acetate, and linalool in decreasing concentration order.
2: Java citronella EO is constituted of 57 different molecules; among them citronellal (40%), geraniol (20%), citronellol (15%), limonene (5%), and eugenol (2%) are the main representatives [ 12, 15, 16].
3: The modes of action of the main constituents of these EOs as herbicides are not fully characterized but their interaction with respectively the lipid and protein fraction of the plant plasma membrane might be involved [ 12].
