0: In the present research, glycerol-based dendrimers (GDs) are proposed as new and original matrix to encapsulate EOs.
1: GDs are macromolecules synthesized from glycerol carbonate (a side product from biofuel production) which already showed good encapsulation ability of contrast agent for medical sectors, metals (nanoparticles), and organic pollutants of used water.
2: Indeed, their tree structure allows intern cavities ( Figure 1), from various sizes depending of the dendrimer generation, to retain molecules [ 17, 18, 19, 20].
3: Glyceroclikdendrimer (GAD) and glyceroladendrimer (GCD) have been recently developed and described in two patents with specific encapsulation abilities toward organic pollutants and metallic salts [ 21, 22].
4: Beyond the agronomic field, EOs encapsulation within dendrimers can be used in a wide range of applications, including food industry (active packaging) and pharmaceutical (drug delivery system) through their bactericidal, viricidal, and fungicidal activities [ 23, 24].
