<p>In the present research, glycerol-based dendrimers (GDs) are proposed as new and original matrix to encapsulate EOs. GDs are macromolecules synthesized from glycerol carbonate (a side product from biofuel production) which already showed good encapsulation ability of contrast agent for medical sectors, metals (nanoparticles), and organic pollutants of used water. Indeed, their tree structure allows intern cavities (

Beyond the agronomic field, EOs encapsulation within dendrimers can be used in a wide range of applications, including food industry (active packaging) and pharmaceutical (drug delivery system) through their bactericidal, viricidal, and fungicidal activities [
