0: The goal of this study is to optimize the encapsulation reaction of two essential oils by four selected dendrimers by maximizing the retention of two GDs, a GCD and a GAD using a PlackettBurman design (PBD) and response surface methodology (RSM) in order to eventually create an effective biosourced herbicide or for other applications where a slow release of EOs is required.
1: PBDs are a screening design that takes into account a large number of factors with a minimal number of trials, while RSMs are an experimental design intended to optimize factors and their combinations [ 25].
2: Obviously, since this study highlights the statistical optimization of the encapsulation, these results can be applied in other fields cited before such as food preservatives creations [ 26].
