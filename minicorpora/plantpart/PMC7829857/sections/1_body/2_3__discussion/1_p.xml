<p>Previous studies have suggested that 
 <italic>GPAT1</italic> is involved in the glycerolipid metabolism and plays a prominent role in tapetum differentiation and male fertility [

 <italic>GPAT1</italic> in Arabidopsis impaired glycerolipid metabolism while accelerating GA biosynthesis and cell wall organization, thus promoting stem cell length and plant height.
