 <italic>GPAT1</italic> is highly expressed in flowers, siliques, and seeds (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00785-f001">Figure 1</xref>), indicating that 
 <italic>GPAT1</italic> may play a significant role in the development of these organs. It was reported that knockout of 
 <italic>GPAT1</italic> in Arabidopsis impaired mitochondrial membrane biogenesis, which led to mitochondrial dysfunction and a delay in tapetal degeneration [
 <xref rid="B31-ijms-22-00785" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Considering the high expression of 
 <italic>GPAT1</italic> in siliques and seeds, seed oil content was quantified following a method which is different from that taken by Zheng et al. [
 <xref rid="B31-ijms-22-00785" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The procedure for seed oil extraction was based on methods described by Hara and Radin [
 <xref rid="B51-ijms-22-00785" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. For transmethylation, we used the triacylglycerol internal standard (TAG-17:0) instead of free fatty acid or its methyl esters, which can minimize errors brought about by variation in the efficiency of methylation. Oil content was then calculated using the formula provided by Li et al. [
 <xref rid="B52-ijms-22-00785" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], which showed significant reduction in mutants of 
 <italic>GPAT1</italic> compared with WT and COM plants (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00785-f003">Figure 3</xref>A). Furthermore, the FA composition of seed TAG was also significantly altered in mutant plants (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00785-f003">Figure 3</xref>Bâ€“D). These results suggest that 
 <italic>GPAT1</italic> is essential for oil biosynthesis not just in flowers but also in different tissues of the plant, which is consistent with the high expression pattern of 
 <italic>GPAT1</italic> in siliques and seeds.
