<p>GAs act as a key factor in controlling plant height by regulating cell elongation [
 <xref rid="B53-ijms-22-00785" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], and are generated from GGPP, which is produced by GGPPS [

 <xref rid="B54-ijms-22-00785" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,
 <xref rid="B55-ijms-22-00785" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Loss of 
 <italic>GPAT1</italic> increased the expression of 
 <italic>GGPPS2</italic> and 
 <italic>GGPPS4</italic> significantly (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-22-00785">Table S2</xref>), which may provide more GGPP for GA biosynthesis. GA20ox and GA3ox are responsible for the final formation of bioactive GAs, which are dominant in the regulation of GA biosynthesis [

 <xref rid="B60-ijms-22-00785" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Among the four 
 <italic>GA3ox</italic> genes identified in Arabidopsis, 
 <italic>GA3ox1</italic> and 
 <italic>GA3ox2</italic> function redundantly in the production of bioactive GAs required for stem elongation, while 
 <italic>GA3ox1</italic> plays a predominant role [
 <xref rid="B57-ijms-22-00785" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The increased expression of 
 <italic>GA3ox1</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00785-f006">Figure 6</xref>E and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00785-f007">Figure 7</xref>A and 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-22-00785">Table S2</xref>) indicated that it may contribute to the stem elongation of 
 <italic>gpat1</italic> mutant plants. Among the five 
 <italic>GA20oxs</italic> in Arabidopsis, 
 <italic>GA20ox1</italic> and 
 <italic>GA20ox3</italic> were the top two abundantly expressed genes in stems, and while 
 <italic>GA20ox1</italic> has been demonstrated to function in stem elongation, 
 <italic>GA20ox3</italic> maybe also have unreported functions related to this due to its expression pattern [
 <xref rid="B59-ijms-22-00785" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Our results show that the transcript level of 
 <italic>GA20ox1</italic> was enhanced in 
 <italic>gpat1</italic> mutants, although the increase was not marked according to RNA-seq data, the expression of 
 <italic>GA20ox3</italic> was significantly promoted (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00785-f006">Figure 6</xref>E and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00785-f007">Figure 7</xref>A and 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-22-00785">Table S2</xref>), indicating that 
 <italic>GA20ox3</italic> may play a key role in stem elongation in the case of 
 <italic>gpat1</italic> mutants. Bioactive GA concentrations are regulated through its biosynthesis and inactivation, and GA inactivation can be achieved through the GA methyl transferase (GAMT), gibberellin 2 oxidase (GA2ox), and CYP714A catabolic enzymes [
 <xref rid="B10-ijms-22-00785" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In 
 <italic>gpat1</italic> mutants, the mRNA levels of 
 <italic>GA2ox1</italic> and 
 <italic>GA2ox4</italic> were evidently reduced while that of 
 <italic>GA2ox2</italic> increased significantly (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00785-f006">Figure 6</xref>E and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00785-f007">Figure 7</xref>A, and 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-22-00785">Table S2</xref>). The antagonism between these three genes may contribute to reduced production of inactive GAs. However, we were not able to determine why these GA2oxs exhibited different expression levels in the gpat1 mutant compared with WT.
