<p>In our work, loss of function of 
 <italic>GPAT1</italic> was shown to impair glycerolipid metabolism in Arabidopsis, leading to reduced total seed yield, but promote stem cell elongation and plant height. RNA-seq and qRT-PCR data suggest that loss of 
 <italic>GPAT1</italic> resulted in increased expression of genes in the MEP pathway, GA biosynthesis and signaling, and pathways involved in cell wall organization and biogenesis, which may explain the elongated cell length and enhanced plant height observed. GPAT1 catalyzes the first step of glycerolipid biosynthesis by acylating glycerol-3-phosphate at the sn-1 or sn-2 hydroxyl with an acyl donor, while the fatty acyls are offered by FAs. In FA biosynthesis, pyruvate is an important precursor for producing FAs, and is also the precursor for the MEP pathway that contributes GA biosynthesis. Thus, we speculate that the 
 <italic>GPAT1</italic> mutation-mediated glycerolipid metabolism impairment may reduce the utilization of pyruvate for the MEP pathway. This may therefore activate GA biosynthesis and cell wall organization to accelerate cell elongation and promote plant height. However, this inference needs further experiments to be authenticated.
