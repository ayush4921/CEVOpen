<p>Loss of 
 <italic>GPAT1</italic> led to a decrease in seed yield, which may have disorganized the normal energy distribution in plants. We speculated that impairment of reproductive development may be conducive to vegetative development. Thus, we assessed the morphology of 
 <italic>gpat1</italic>, 
 <italic>gpat1-c1</italic>, and WT plants. By comparison, we found that knockout of 
 <italic>GPAT1</italic> increased plant height markedly (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00785-f004">Figure 4</xref>). The complementation experiment reversed this phenotype, strongly implying that 
 <italic>GPAT1</italic> played a role in the regulation of plant height. Plant height is often correlated with cell elongation. To investigate whether loss of 
 <italic>GPAT1</italic> affected the cell morphology of stems to result in altered plant height, we measured the cell length of longitudinal paraffin sections obtained from stems. Cell length of stems from 
 <italic>GPAT1</italic> mutant plants was dramatically higher than those of WT and COM plants (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00785-f005">Figure 5</xref>A,B). These results indicated that knockout of 
 <italic>GPAT1</italic> contributed to cell elongation in stems of Arabidopsis.
