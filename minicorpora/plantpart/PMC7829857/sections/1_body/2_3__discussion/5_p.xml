<p>The movement and distribution of bioactive GAs are important for plant growth and development [
 <xref rid="B10-ijms-22-00785" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The mRNA level of 
 <italic>NPF1.3</italic>, a GA influx transporter gene, was markedly higher in the 
 <italic>gpat1</italic> mutant than in WT (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00785-f006">Figure 6</xref>F and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00785-f007">Figure 7</xref>A, and 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-22-00785">Table S2</xref>), suggesting that 
 <italic>NPF1.3</italic> may play a role in the increased distribution of bioactive GAs in stems of gpat1 mutants. GA signaling is essential for the physiological functions of GAs, in which the hub repressor DELLA, GA receptor GID1, and the F-box proteins SLY1 and SNEEZY (SLY2/SNE) in Arabidopsis and GID2 in rice are regarded as key components [
 <xref rid="B46-ijms-22-00785" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In 
 <italic>gpat1</italic> mutants, the expression of DELLA protein 
 <italic>GAI</italic>, 
 <italic>SLY1</italic>, and 
 <italic>SLY2</italic> were not altered, while one of the three 
 <italic>GID1</italic> genes, 
 <italic>GID1B</italic>, was more highly expressed than in WT. Among the three 
 <italic>GID1</italic> genes, 
 <italic>GID1A</italic> contributed most to GA responses [
 <xref rid="B61-ijms-22-00785" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], and its transcript level was slightly higher in 
 <italic>gpat1</italic> mutants compared with WT (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00785-f006">Figure 6</xref>F and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00785-f007">Figure 7</xref>A and 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-22-00785">Table S2</xref>), indicating that both 
 <italic>GID1A</italic> and 
 <italic>GID1B</italic> may contribute to the stem elongation of 
 <italic>gpat1</italic> mutants.
