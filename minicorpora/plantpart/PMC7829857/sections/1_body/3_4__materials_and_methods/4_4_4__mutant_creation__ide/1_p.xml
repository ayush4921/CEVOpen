<p>To create a mutant of the 
 <italic>GPAT1</italic> gene with the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system, we designed an sgRNA target sequence using the online tool CRISPR-P2.0 (
 <uri xlink:href="http://crispr.hzau.edu.cn/CRISPR2/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://crispr.hzau.edu.cn/CRISPR2/</uri>) [
 <xref rid="B81-ijms-22-00785" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. The selected target sequence was cloned into the final 
 <italic>pAtU6-26:sgRNA-23p35S:Cas9 pBlunt</italic> vector [
 <xref rid="B82-ijms-22-00785" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. The construct was confirmed by sequencing and then introduced into WT Arabidopsis plants via the floral dip method [
 <xref rid="B79-ijms-22-00785" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. For genotyping, the target sequences of each 
 <italic>GPAT1</italic> gene were amplified from WT and transgenic lines, after which PCR products were directly sequenced for analysis. The mutated sequences of each 
 <italic>GPAT1</italic> gene in the transgenic lines were revealed by aligning the sequences between WT and the transgenic lines. T-DNA insertional line SALK_052352 for 
 <italic>GPAT1</italic> was verified using the procedures provided by the Salk Institute Genomic Analysis Laboratory (

 <italic>GPAT1</italic> fragment was amplified from WT Arabidopsis, cloned into the pCambia1300 vector, and then introduced into 
 <italic>gpat1</italic> homozygote mutants via the floral dip method. The primers used above are outlined in
