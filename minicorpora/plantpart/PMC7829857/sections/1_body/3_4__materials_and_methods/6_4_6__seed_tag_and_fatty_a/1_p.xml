<p>TAG extraction from Arabidopsis seeds was performed as described previously [

 <xref rid="B83-ijms-22-00785" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Approximately 10 mg of dried seeds was used for TAG extraction, and the lipid extracts were evaporated under nitrogen for direct methylation. For transmethylation, methanol containing 5% (
