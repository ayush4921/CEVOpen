<p>Total RNA was extracted from various tissues of WT Arabidopsis plants using RNAiso plus reagent (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) following the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA obtained using the PrimeScript™ RT reagent Kit with gDNA Eraser (TaKaRa) was used for quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). qRT-PCR was performed using SYBR
 <sup>®</sup> Premix Ex Taq™ (Tli RNaseH Plus) and the CFX96 Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA), as specified by the manufacturer. The primers used for RT-PCR and qRT-PCR are listed in
