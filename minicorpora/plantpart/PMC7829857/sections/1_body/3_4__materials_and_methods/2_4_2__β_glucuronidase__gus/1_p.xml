<p>For the GUS staining assay, a 2045-bp sequence upstream of the first ATG in the 
 <italic>GPAT1</italic> gene was cloned into the binary vector pCAMBIA1301 carrying the 
 <italic>GUS</italic> gene downstream of the inserted promoter [

 <italic>ProGPAT1::GUS</italic> was transformed into WT Arabidopsis (Col-0) plants via the floral dip method [
 <xref rid="B79-ijms-22-00785" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Transgenic plants were screened by hygromycin (25 Î¼g/mL) selection, and the homozygous transgenic lines were used for GUS analysis. GUS histochemical staining was performed according to procedures described previously [
