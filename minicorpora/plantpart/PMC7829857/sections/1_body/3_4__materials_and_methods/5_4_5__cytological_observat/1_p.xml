<p>For histological analysis, the first basal node of stems above the rosette leaves were collected from WT, 
 <italic>gpat1</italic>, 
 <italic>gpat1-c1</italic>, and complementation transgenic lines and fixed in FAA (75% ethanol:acetic acid:formaldehyde, 90:5:5, 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) for 24 h, dehydrated with a graded series of ethanol (75%, 85%, 90%, 95%, and 100%—50 min each step), followed by an immersion in 100% xylene and embedding in paraffin. Samples were cut into 8-µm thick transverse serial sections with a Leica RM2016 microtome and mounted on glass slides. The sections were stained with toluidine blue for 5 min, washed three times with water, and sealed with resin when dried. Samples were photographed with a Leica DM1000. The images obtained were used for cell length measurement with Image J software.
