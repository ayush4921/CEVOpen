<p>WT (ecotype Columbia-0), 
 <italic>gpat1</italic> (SALK_052352) and CRISPR-generated 
 <italic>gpat1-c1</italic> mutants, and COM (transgenic complementation lines of gpat1) A. thaliana seeds were used in this study. Seeds were sown on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium (1% sucrose, 1% agar), imbibed at 4 °C for 2–3 days in the dark, and transferred to a growth chamber with a light intensity of 200 μmol m
 <sup>−2</sup> s
 <sup>−1</sup> (16/8 h of light/dark at 22 °C). Ten-day-old seedlings grown on plates were transferred to potting soil under controlled growth conditions. The mutant SALK_052352 was bought from ABRC.
