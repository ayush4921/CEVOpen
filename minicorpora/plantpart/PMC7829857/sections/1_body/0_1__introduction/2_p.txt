0: Bioactive GAs are plant diterpene hormones that are essential for multiple aspects of plant growth and development, including seed germination, leaf expansion, trichome development, stem elongation, flowering, male fertility, and fruit set [ 7, 8, 9].
1: GA biosynthesis in plants involves many enzymes and cellular compartments, as well as the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway [ 9, 10, 11].
2: The plastid-specific methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway is particularly responsible for GA generation, as it provides the precursor geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) required for GA biosynthesis [ 11].
3: GGPP is converted to bioactive GAs sequentially by the copalyl diphosphate synthase (CPS), ent-kaurene synthase (KS), ent-kaurene oxidase (KO), ent-kaurenoic acid oxidase (KAO), and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases (2-OGDs) [ 9, 10].
4: As an important part of its metabolism, deactivation of GA functions to regulate the concentration of bioactive GAs in plants can be achieved through GA2ox [ 12], GA methyl transferase [ 13], and cytochrome P450 monooxygenase [ 14].
5: Furthermore, components of GA signaling such as the GA receptor gibberellin insensitive dwarf 1 (GID1), GID2, and DELLA proteins, can regulate the levels of bioactive GAs to maintain plant growth and development [ 9, 15].
6: GAs induce the expression of cell wall-associated genes, such as xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolases (XTHs), pectin methylesterase (PME), pectin methylesterase inhibitor (PMEI), and expansins (EXPs), to regulate cell expansion, which contributes to stem elongation [ 16, 17, 18, 19].
