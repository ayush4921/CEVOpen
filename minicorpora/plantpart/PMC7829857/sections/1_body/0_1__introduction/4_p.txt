0: In a previous report, Arabidopsis  GPAT1 was shown to act as an essential factor for tapetum and pollen development [ 31].
1: In this work, we studied the role of  GPAT1 in regulating Arabidopsis plant height.
2: Our results revealed that knockout of  GPAT1 increased plant height by activating GA metabolism and signaling, which then stimulated cell wall organization and biogenesis.
3: This study provides evidence on how GPAT-mediated glycerolipid metabolism influences plant height through GA.
