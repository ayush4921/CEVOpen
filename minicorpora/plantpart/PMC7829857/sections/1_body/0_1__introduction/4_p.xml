<p>In a previous report, Arabidopsis 
 <italic>GPAT1</italic> was shown to act as an essential factor for tapetum and pollen development [
 <xref rid="B31-ijms-22-00785" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In this work, we studied the role of 
 <italic>GPAT1</italic> in regulating Arabidopsis plant height. Our results revealed that knockout of 
 <italic>GPAT1</italic> increased plant height by activating GA metabolism and signaling, which then stimulated cell wall organization and biogenesis. This study provides evidence on how GPAT-mediated glycerolipid metabolism influences plant height through GA.
