<p>Considering that GA plays an important role in regulating plant height, as well as the results from our GO and KEGG analyses, we set out to quantify the expression of genes in GA metabolism and signaling. The MEP pathway predominantly provides the precursor GGPP for GA biosynthesis in Arabidopsis [
 <xref rid="B11-ijms-22-00785" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Among the 23 genes in the MEP pathway in Arabidopsis, there were only two DEGs (
 <italic>GGPPS2</italic> and 
 <italic>GGPPS4</italic>) that were significantly upregulated (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-22-00785">Table S1</xref>). GGPP generated by the MEP pathway subsequently gets fluxed into the GA biosynthesis pathway. There were three GA biosynthesis-related DEGs including 
 <italic>GA3ox1</italic>, 
 <italic>GA20ox3</italic>, and 
 <italic>GA20ox5</italic>, and three GA deactivation-related DEGs including 
 <italic>GA2ox1</italic>, 
 <italic>GA2ox2</italic>, and 
 <italic>GA2ox4</italic> found in 
 <italic>gpat1</italic> mutants versus WT lines (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-22-00785">Table S1</xref>). 
 <italic>GA3ox1</italic> and 
 <italic>GA20ox3</italic> were evidently upregulated while 
 <italic>GA20ox5</italic> was markedly downregulated. GA2oxs are mainly responsible for the deactivation of bioactive GAs, and we found that 
 <italic>GA2ox1</italic> and 
 <italic>GA2ox4</italic> were significantly downregulated while 
 <italic>GA2ox2</italic> was observably upregulated (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-22-00785">Table S1</xref>). DEGs related to GA transport and signaling were also found. The nitrate transporter 1/peptide transporter family (NPF) members NPF3.1 [

 <xref rid="B41-ijms-22-00785" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and NPF2.10 [
 <xref rid="B42-ijms-22-00785" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="B43-ijms-22-00785" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,
 <xref rid="B44-ijms-22-00785" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], as well as the SWEET (sugar will eventually be exported transporter) family members SWEET13 and SWEET14 [
 <xref rid="B45-ijms-22-00785" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] were reported to transport GAs in Arabidopsis, and we found 
 <italic>NPF3.1</italic> was significantly upregulated (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-22-00785">Table S1</xref>). The DELLA protein GAI and GA receptor protein GID are extremely important for GA signaling, as well as the F-box proteins SLY1 and SLY2 [

 <xref rid="B46-ijms-22-00785" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], among which 
 <italic>GID1B</italic> was identified as the only DEG that was significantly upregulated (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00785-f006">Figure 6</xref>F and 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-22-00785">Table S1</xref>).
