<p>GAs are important plant hormones that function in the promotion of cell elongation. Plant cell walls determine cell wall sizes and shapes, and are thus essential for plant growth and development [

 <xref rid="B48-ijms-22-00785" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,
 <xref rid="B49-ijms-22-00785" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. GAs can regulate cell wall-related genes to control cell elongation [
 <xref rid="B50-ijms-22-00785" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In line with this, the GO term “cell wall organization or biogenesis” was significantly enriched in our upregulated clustering analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00785-f006">Figure 6</xref>B). Upon further analysis, there were more upregulated DEGs from this GO term than those that were downregulated (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00785-f006">Figure 6</xref>G). Out of the 37 total upregulated DEGs, the 
 <italic>xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase</italic> (
 <italic>XTH</italic>) gene family was most enriched, followed by genes involved in pectin modification such as 
 <italic>PME</italic> (
 <italic>pectin methylesterase</italic>), 
 <italic>PMEI</italic> (
 <italic>pectin methylesterase inhibitor</italic>), and 
 <italic>PAE</italic> (
 <italic>pectin acetylesterase</italic>), and other polysaccharide-related genes such as 
 <italic>polygalacturonase</italic>, 
 <italic>galacturonosyltransferase</italic>, 
 <italic>glycosyltransferase</italic>, 
 <italic>cellulose synthase</italic>, 
 <italic>endo-1,4-β-xylanase</italic>, 
 <italic>O-fucosyltransferase</italic>, and 
 <italic>endochitinase</italic>. In addition, other cell wall-associated genes such as 
 <italic>expansin</italic>, 
 <italic>extensin</italic>, and 
 <italic>oxidase</italic> (i.e., 
 <italic>peroxidase</italic>, 
 <italic>cytochrome P450</italic>, 
 <italic>galactose oxidase</italic>) were all included in the upregulated DEGs. Out of the 26 downregulated DEGs, there were 16 pectin-associated genes, 4 expansin genes, and 2 cellulose synthase genes. Furthermore, cell wall-related genes such as 
 <italic>BXL2</italic> (
 <italic>beta-D-xylosidase 2</italic>), 
 <italic>TBL15</italic> (
 <italic>trichome birefringence-like 15</italic>), 
 <italic>CASP2</italic> (
 <italic>casparian strip membrane domain protein 2</italic>), 
 <italic>COBL10</italic> (
 <italic>COBRA-like 10</italic>), 
 <italic>PER2</italic> (
 <italic>peroxidase 2</italic>), and 
 <italic>FLS2</italic> (
 <italic>flagellin-sensitive 2</italic>) also belonged to the downregulated DEGs.
