<p>To uncover the mechanisms of stem lengthening and accompanying cell phenotypes in knockout mutants of 
 <italic>GPAT1</italic>, RNA-Seq was conducted to identify DEGs and their associated GO (gene ontology) terms and KEGG (Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes) pathways. A total of 1585 DEGs were identified between WT and 
 <italic>gpat1</italic> plants, with 872 genes upregulated and 713 genes downregulated (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00785-f006">Figure 6</xref>A). GO and KEGG enrichment analyses were employed to gain insights into the biological functions of the upregulated DEGs, with the significantly enriched pathways shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00785-f006">Figure 6</xref>B,C. For example, the hormone metabolic process and regulation of hormone levels pathways were the top two highly enriched GO terms, while GA biosynthesis-related isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway was also enriched. Cell wall-related metabolite processes were also enriched, as were the polysaccharide metabolic process, mucilage biosynthetic process, and cell wall organization or biogenesis process. There were five enriched KEGG pathways including cutin, suberine and wax biosynthesis, linolenic acid metabolism, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, glucosinolate biosynthesis, and zeatin biosynthesis. The results from GO and KEGG analyses indicated that a loss of 
 <italic>GPAT1</italic> function may accelerate the hormone metabolic processes and cell wall-related secondary metabolite biosynthetic processes.
