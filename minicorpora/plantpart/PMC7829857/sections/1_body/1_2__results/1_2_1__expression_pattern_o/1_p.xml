<p>In previous studies using RNA gel blot analysis, 
 <italic>GPAT1</italic> was shown to be mainly expressed in developing siliques and flower buds [
 <xref rid="B31-ijms-22-00785" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. To further determine the expression pattern of 
 <italic>GPAT1</italic>, we made a construct where the GUS reporter was driven by the 
 <italic>GPAT1</italic> promoter, and transfected it into WT Arabidopsis plants. One transgenic 
 <italic>Pro
  <sub>GPAT1</sub>-GUS
 </italic> line was selected to analyze the expression of 
 <italic>GPAT1</italic> gene. GUS activity was detected in young seedlings, roots, leaves, inflorescence stems, flowers, and mature seeds by histochemical staining (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00785-f001">Figure 1</xref>Aâ€“I). GUS staining in the hypocotyls was strongest in whole, seven-day-old seedlings, including their cotyledons and roots (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00785-f001">Figure 1</xref>A). Expression of 
 <italic>GPAT1</italic> in roots was only detected in the stele, while there was no GUS activity in the epidermis, cortex, or endodermis of the roots (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00785-f001">Figure 1</xref>B,C). GUS expression was also observed in rosette leaves, and leaf venation showed stronger GUS activity than other parts of the leaf (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00785-f001">Figure 1</xref>D). GUS expression was also detectable in inflorescences and upper inflorescence stems of WT plants; strong staining was observed in the former and weak in the latter (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00785-f001">Figure 1</xref>E). Though GUS activity was detected in upper stems, no GUS activity was observed in the middle and lower stems (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-22-00785">Figure S1</xref>). In flowers, GUS activity was also detected in sepals, petals, and carpels (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00785-f001">Figure 1</xref>F), while expression in stamens was demonstrated by in situ hybridization [
 <xref rid="B36-ijms-22-00785" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00785-f001">Figure 1</xref>G,H shows that 
 <italic>GPAT1</italic> was also expressed in young (about four days after pollination) siliques, as well as in mature seeds. To determine the relative expression levels of 
 <italic>GPAT1</italic> in different tissues of WT Arabidopsis plants, we performed qRT-PCR experiments. qRT-PCR indicated that the highest expression level of 
 <italic>GPAT1</italic> was in the seed, followed by a descending order of siliques, flowers, stems and leaves, roots, and seedlings (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00785-f001">Figure 1</xref>I). The 
 <italic>GPAT1</italic> expression pattern indicated by qRT-PCR was similar to that presented by GUS staining. These results suggest that 
 <italic>GPAT1</italic> mRNA is significantly expressed in seeds, siliques, flowers, and steles, the only region in roots that expresses 
 <italic>GPAT1</italic>.
