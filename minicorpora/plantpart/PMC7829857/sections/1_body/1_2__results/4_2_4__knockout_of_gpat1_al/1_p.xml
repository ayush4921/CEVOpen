<p>To investigate whether the cell morphology of the stem was affected by mutations in 
 <italic>GPAT1</italic>, the basal nodes of stems from ten-week-old WT, 
 <italic>gpat1</italic>, 
 <italic>gpat1-c1</italic>, and the complementation transgenic COM plants were selected and embedded in paraffin sections, followed by an analysis of their anatomical details (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00785-f005">Figure 5</xref>A). By measuring the cell length of longitudinal paraffin sections obtained from stems, we found that mutations in 
 <italic>GPAT1</italic> increased cell length significantly compared to WT plants (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00785-f005">Figure 5</xref>B). The alteration of cell morphology brought by a loss-of-function in 
 <italic>GPAT1</italic> was recovered by introducing the whole genomic sequence of the 
 <italic>GPAT1</italic> gene into the 
 <italic>gpat1</italic> mutant, which confirmed that the mutation introduced to 
 <italic>GPAT1</italic> significantly contributed to the alteration of the cell morphology of the stems (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00785-f005">Figure 5</xref>A,B). These results show that a loss of 
 <italic>GPAT1</italic> promotes cell elongation during stem development.
