<p>We also selected and verified ten representatively upregulated DEGs involved in cell wall organization through qRT-PCR analysis. The mRNA levels of 
 <italic>XTH31</italic>, 
 <italic>PME16</italic>, 
 <italic>PMEI6</italic>, and 
 <italic>EXPA15</italic> were upregulated by almost 2-fold in the 
 <italic>gpat1</italic> mutant(
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00785-f007">Figure 7</xref>B), while those of 
 <italic>RGP3</italic>, 
 <italic>XYN4</italic>, and 
 <italic>CSLB3</italic>, which are involved in cell wall polysaccharide biosynthesis or modification, were also upregulated by almost 1.5- to 3-fold, respectively, in the 
 <italic>gpat1</italic> mutant (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00785-f007">Figure 7</xref>B). The transcript levels of 
 <italic>EXT4</italic> and the galactose oxidase 
 <italic>RUBY</italic> were also enhanced by 1.5-fold, while that of 
 <italic>PER36</italic> increased by 1.6-fold in the 
 <italic>gpat1</italic> mutants (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00785-f007">Figure 7</xref>B). After verifying the accuracy of our transcriptomics data through qRT-PCR, we determined that our RNA-Seq and qRT-PCR data were highly correlated, with an R
 <sup>2</sup> of 0.9531 (
