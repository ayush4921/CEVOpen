<p>We selected and verified ten DEGs in pathways of isoprenoid biosynthesis and GA metabolism and signaling through qRT-PCR analysis. For 
 <italic>GGPPS</italic> genes, the transcript levels of 
 <italic>GGPPS2</italic> and 
 <italic>GGPPS4</italic> were increased by about 1.3-fold and 1.4-fold in the 
 <italic>gpat1</italic> mutant lines, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00785-f007">Figure 7</xref>A). For GA biosynthesis, the expression levels of 
 <italic>GA3ox1</italic> and 
 <italic>GA20ox3</italic> were respectively enhanced by almost 2.5- and 2-fold, while that of 
 <italic>GA20ox5</italic> was decreased by about 0.5-fold in the 
 <italic>gpat1</italic> mutant lines (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00785-f007">Figure 7</xref>A). For GA inactivation, the mRNA levels of 
 <italic>GA2ox1</italic> and 
 <italic>GA2ox4</italic> were respectively reduced by 86.4% and 34.6%, while that of 
 <italic>GA2ox2</italic> was increased by 78.9% in the 
 <italic>gpat1</italic> mutant plants (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00785-f007">Figure 7</xref>A). The transcript level of 
 <italic>NPF3.1</italic> was promoted by almost 2.4-fold in the 
 <italic>gpat1</italic> mutant plants (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00785-f007">Figure 7</xref>A), while that of 
 <italic>GID1B</italic> was also upregulated by approximately 2-fold (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00785-f007">Figure 7</xref>A).
