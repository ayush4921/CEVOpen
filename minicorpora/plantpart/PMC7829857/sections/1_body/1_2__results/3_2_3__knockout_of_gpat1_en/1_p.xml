<p>Mutation in 
 <italic>GPAT1</italic> resulted in reduced yield, as indicated by the reduced silique size and seed yield per silique [
 <xref rid="B31-ijms-22-00785" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In some situations, plant height is negatively correlated with seed yield [
 <xref rid="B2-ijms-22-00785" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. To investigate whether Arabidopsis 
 <italic>GPAT1</italic> is associated with plant height, we compared the height among the mutants of 
 <italic>GPAT1</italic> and WT plants (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00785-f004">Figure 4</xref>A). Compared with WT, plant heights of 
 <italic>gpat1</italic> and 
 <italic>gpat1-c1</italic> mutants were promoted by 21.5% and 21.3%, respectively, while that of the complementation transgenic COM plants was not altered (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00785-f004">Figure 4</xref>B). We further scored the total seed yield per plant, which was severely reduced in 
 <italic>gpat1</italic> and 
 <italic>gpat1-c1</italic> mutants, by 49.7% and 53.2% compared to WT, respectively, while the total seed yield of the COM plants was comparable to that of WT (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00785-f004">Figure 4</xref>C). Due to the high expression of GPAT1 in roots and hypocotyls (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00785-f001">Figure 1</xref>A), we also analyzed the primary root length and hypocotyl length of WT and 
 <italic>gpat1</italic> mutant plants. There was no evident difference in primary root length or hypocotyl length found between WT and 
 <italic>gpat1</italic> mutant plants (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-22-00785">Figure S3Aâ€“C</xref>). These results suggest that knockout of Arabidopsis 
 <italic>GPAT1</italic> increased plant height but decreased total seed yield.
