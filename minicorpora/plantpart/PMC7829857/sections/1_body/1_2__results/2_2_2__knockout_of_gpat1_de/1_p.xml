<p>In a previous work, Zheng et al. showed that loss of 
 <italic>GPAT1</italic> caused no significant change in seed oil content, but reduced TAG content in flower buds [
 <xref rid="B31-ijms-22-00785" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The underlying mechanism controlling this phenomenon was not clear. On account of the high expression of 
 <italic>GPAT1</italic> in siliques and seeds, we inferred that 
 <italic>GPAT1</italic> might play an important role in seed oil biosynthesis. To test this, we ordered a proven loss-of-function mutant (SALK_052352) of 
 <italic>GPAT1</italic> (
 <italic>gpat1</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B36-ijms-22-00785" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], which had a T-DNA insertion in the second exon (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00785-f002">Figure 2</xref>A), and created a new loss-of-function mutant by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing (
 <italic>gpat1-c1</italic>) to further target the first exon (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00785-f002">Figure 2</xref>B,C). Through sequencing, we found that a 26-bp sequence near the sgRNA target was deleted in the 
 <italic>gpat1</italic>-c1 mutant, which led to the early appearance of a stop codon TAA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00785-f002">Figure 2</xref>D).
