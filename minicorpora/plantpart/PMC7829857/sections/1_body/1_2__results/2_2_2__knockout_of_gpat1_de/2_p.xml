<p>We then implemented a different protocol to determine the seed oil and FA contents in WT and mutants of 
 <italic>GPAT1</italic>. Seed oil contents of 
 <italic>gpat1</italic> and 
 <italic>gpat1-c1</italic> mutants were reduced by 11.7% and 13.7% compared with that of WT, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00785-f003">Figure 3</xref>A). We further analyzed the FA composition in seed TAG, which was significantly altered in mutant plants (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00785-f003">Figure 3</xref>B). For example, palmitic acid (16:0), palmitoleic acid (16:1), stearic acid (18:0), and arachidic (20:0) contents in 
 <italic>gpat1</italic> seeds were 5.0%, 17.9%, 14.9%, and 13.9% lower than in WT seeds, respectively. In contrast, oleic acid (18:1) content was 7.1% higher in 
 <italic>gpat1</italic> seeds than in WT seeds. Similar results were found in the 
 <italic>gpat1-c1</italic> line. We also analyzed the contents of 16-, 18-, 20-, and 22-carbon FAs. The levels of 16-carbon FAs were markedly lower in seeds of mutant plants, while levels of 18-, 20-, and 22-carbon FAs were similar to those of WT seeds (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00785-f003">Figure 3</xref>C). The total contents of saturated (16:0, 18:0, 20:0, and 22:0) FAs were significantly reduced, whereas the total contents of monounsaturated FAs (MUFAs) with one double bond (16:1, 18:1, 20:1, and 22:1) increased (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00785-f003">Figure 3</xref>D). To further confirm the function of 
 <italic>GPAT1</italic> in seed oil biosynthesis, we developed a complementation transgenic line to the 
 <italic>gpat1</italic> mutant (COM), and measured the mRNA levels of 
 <italic>GPAT1</italic> in WT, 
 <italic>gpat1</italic>, and COM by RT-PCR. The expression of 
 <italic>GPAT1</italic> in COM and WT was comparable while that in the 
 <italic>gpat1</italic> and 
 <italic>gpat1-c1</italic> was undetectable (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00785-f003">Figure 3</xref>E), suggesting that COM was available. The oil content and levels of different FAs in seeds of the COM line were also comparable to those of WT plants (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00785-f003">Figure 3</xref>Aâ€“D). We also studied the role of 
 <italic>GPAT1</italic> gene in cuticle formation via toluidine blue dye method [
 <xref rid="B35-ijms-22-00785" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], and analysis of the leaf cuticle of 
 <italic>gpat1</italic> mutant did not reveal any obvious cuticle defect (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-22-00785">Figure S2</xref>) which suggested that disruption of 
 <italic>GPAT1</italic> gene might have no significant effect on cuticle formation. Taken together, these results suggest that knockout of 
 <italic>GPAT1</italic> leads to remarkable reduction in seed oil content and alteration of FA compositions, which is consistent with the expression profile of 
 <italic>GPAT1</italic>.
