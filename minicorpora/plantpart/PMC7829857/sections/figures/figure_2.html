 <caption> Mutant creation and identification of GPAT1. ( A) Structure of GPAT1 gene and genomic organization of the gpat1 loci. The T-DNA insertion point is indicated as a triangle. ( B) Structure of the pAtU6-26:sgRNA-23p35S:Cas9 pBlunt vector. ( C) CRISPR/Cas9 sgRNA targets the first exon of GPAT1. The box indicates the target sequences. ( D) Sequencing of the GPAT1 site targeted by sgRNA. Red hyphens indicate the deletions which led to the early appearance of the stop codon. Red letter T indicate the stop codon. </caption>
