 <caption> Knockout of GPAT1 alters the stem cell morphology. ( A) Longitudinal section of stems obtained from ten-week-old WT, gpat1, gpat1-c1 and COM plants. The basal nodes of stems were selected for embedding in paraffin sections. Bar = 200 μm. ( B) The length of stem cells of ten-week-old WT, gpat1, gpat1-c1 and COM plants. Values are mean ± SD ( n = 150 cells from five individual longitudinal sections of stems). Different letters indicate significant differences at p &lt; 0.05, as determined by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post-test. WT, wild type. </caption>
