 <caption> qRT-PCR profiling of DEGs between WT and gpat1 lines. ( A) The expression levels of genes in the MEP pathway, GA metabolism and signaling pathway. ( B) The transcript levels of genes involved in cell wall biogenesis or organization. ( C) Correlation analysis of gene expression pattern by RNA-seq and qRT-PCR. Expression values are relative to that of the EV control. Values are means Â± SE ( n = 3 technical replicates). </caption>
