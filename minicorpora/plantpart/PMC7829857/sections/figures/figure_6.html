 <caption> RNA-Seq profiling of WT and gpat1 lines. ( A) Volcano plot showing the DEGs between two libraries of WT and gpat1 lines. p-adjust &lt; 0.05 &amp; |log 2FC| ≥ 1 were used as the threshold to determine the significance of DEGs. Green dots show down-regulated genes, red dots represent up-regulated genes, and grey dots indicate transcripts that did not change significantly in the gpat1 library compared with the WT. ( B, C) GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of up-regulated DEGs between WT and gpat1 lines. ( D– G) Heat map showed the genes expression in the MEP pathway, GA metabolism pathway, GA transport and signaling and cell wall organization or biogenesis. </caption>
