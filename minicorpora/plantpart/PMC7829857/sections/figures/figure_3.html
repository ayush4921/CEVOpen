 <caption> Effect on seed oil content and FA composition by GPAT1 mutation. ( A) TAG contents of dry seeds of WT, gpat1, gpat1-c1 and complementation line COM plants grown in soil. Data are means of the five replicates with SE. DW, dry weight. ( B) Fatty-acid composition in TAGs of WT, gpat1, gpat1-c1 and COM lines. ( C) Contents of 16-, 18-, 20-, and 22-carbon FAs in TAGs of WT, gpat1, gpat1-c1 and COM lines. ( D) Contents of saturated FAs and unsaturated FAs with one, two, or three double bonds in TAGs of WT, gpat1, gpat1-c1 and COM lines. (E) Level of GPAT1 transcript in developing siliques at âˆ¼20 days after flowering (DAF) in WT, gpat1, gpat1-c1 and COM plants. Values are means and SE based on one-way ANOVA (Duncan and Tukey test). Different letters indicate significant differences at p &lt; 0.05. WT, wild type. </caption>
