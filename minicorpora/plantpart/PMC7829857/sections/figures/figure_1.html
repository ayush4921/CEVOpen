 <caption> Analysis of GPAT1 expression in Arabidopsis wild-type plants. ( A– H) Expression analysis of GPAT1 by Pro GPAT1-GUS . ( A) GUS staining in a five-day-old seedling grown on agar. Bar = 10 mm. ( B, C) GUS staining in roots of seven-day-old seedlings grown on agar. The red solid circle, triangle and pentagram indicated the epidermis, cortex and endodermis, respectively. Bar = 20 μm. ( D) GUS staining in rosette leaves. Bar = 10 mm. ( E) GUS staining in inflorescences and inflorescence stems. Bar = 2 mm. ( F) GUS staining in flowers. Bar = 1 mm. ( G) GUS staining in 4-DAP siliques. DAP, day after pollination. Bar = 1 mm. ( H) GUS staining in mature seeds. Bar = 100 μm. ( I) Expression profiles of GPAT1 in different tissues of WT plants. Total RNA was extracted from different tissues of soil-grown plants for qRT-PCR. Values were standardized using the Arabidopsis Actin 2 gene. Values are the means of three independent experiments ± standard error (SE) ( n = 3). </caption>
