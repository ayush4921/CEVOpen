 <caption> Effect on plant morphology and yield by knockout of GPAT1. ( A) Ten-week-old plants of WT, gpat1, gpat1-c1 and the complementation transgenic line COM. Bar = 10 cm. ( B) The gpat1 and gpat1-c1 mutant plants showed increased plant height compared with WT and COM plants. Plant height was determined from ten independent plants from five plots for each genotype ( n = 10). ( C) Total seed yield of individual plant from two plots ( n = 12). Values are means Â± SE based on one-way ANOVA (Duncan and Tukey test). Different letters indicate significant difference at p &lt; 0.05. WT, wild type. </caption>
