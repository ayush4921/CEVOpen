<p>To detect cell viability, direct trypan blue exclusion method was used as proposed by Selcen et al., 2017 [
 <xref rid="B24-materials-14-00824" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Cells were treated in a 6-well plate with DM-ZnO-Try NE samples for 3 h and 24 h at the concentrations 10 μg/mL and 12 μg/mL. Cells were then incubated with 0.2% trypan blue solution for 10 min at 20° followed by the fixation step. Further, cells were washed with PBS again after trypan blue treatment and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), and incubated for ½ hours at 20°. Then the PFA was removed and washed each well with 1× sterile PBS 3 times. Further, the stained and fixed cells were visualized using a 20× objective of Nikon eclipse TS100.
