<p>The 
 <italic>DM-</italic>ZnO NPs were carefully synthesized employing the previously existing procedure with minor modifications during the precipitation conditions [
 <xref rid="B16-materials-14-00824" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The plant extract was treated with zinc nitrate hexahydrate and sodium hydroxide as a neutralizing precursor. The synthetic conditions include the coprecipitation of nano Zn, and the further isolated nanoparticle was purified by repeated washings with water. This purification ensures the complete removal of unreacted zinc nitrate salt and other foreign substances from the extract. Of 10% 
 <italic>DM</italic> extract (
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) 200 mL was combined with 800 mL of distilled water while stirring, and then with continuous stirring (500 rpm), 0.1 mM (100 mL) of zinc nitrate salt was added to the light brown solution. To the warm solution, around 70 °C, 0.2 M (150 mL) aqueous solution of NaOH was added drop by drop with a constant stirring for over 2.0 h. During this process, the formation of precipitation begins, then thickens, and finally forms a consistent homogeneous mixture. The concoction was left to cool down by not stirring. Once the mixture was cooled down, it was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 15 min to eliminate the unreacted plant extracts and Zn nitrate. Then, at 5 °C, a cold-water wash was carried out. The centrifuged isolated precipitate was further dried at 60 °C for around 12 h in a hot air oven. During drying the isolated Zn (OH)
 <sub>2</sub> converts to nano ZnO as off-white powder.
