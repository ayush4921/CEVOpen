0: We prepared a biologically active nanoparticles and nanoemulsion in this study.
1: Additionally, we carried out structural characterization utilizing the dynamic light scattering (DLS), Fourier transforms infrared analysis (FTIR), field emission-transmission electron microscopy (FE-TEM), ultravioletvisible (UVVis) spectrophotometry, and FE-SEM.
2: First, we successfully synthesized DM-ZnO-NPs from the  DM plant extract.
3: Next, antiobesity drug tryptophan was then loaded using food grade olive oil in a water nanoemulsion system by adding ZnO NPs water solution along with the surfactant tween 80.
4: Further, we investigated the effect of the synthesized nanoformulation using the RAW 264.7 and 3T3-L1 cell lines.
5: Additionally, we checked the antiobesity property with the differentiation of preadipocytes from observing the reduction of lipid droplets in the cells over a period, which implies an acceptable level of nano ZnO concentration can ameliorate the physiological homeostasis for obesity and its associated metabolic disorders.
