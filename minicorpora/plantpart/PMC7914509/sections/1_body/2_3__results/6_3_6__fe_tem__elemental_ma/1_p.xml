<p>The morphology of the nanoparticles and nanoemulsions were characterized further using FE TEM. The unimodal size distribution with an average diameter of around 200 nm was observed. The spheroidal structure of nanoparticles for nanoparticles and nanoflowers with the combination of 3–4 board petal-like structures for nanoemulsion were noticed.

Noticeable change of petal shape is due to the entrapment of tryptophan. Furthermore, this petal-like structure can damage the cell wall and cell mechanisms greater than its spherical shape. Elemental mapping revealed the distribution of Zn (red dot)
