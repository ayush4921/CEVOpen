<p>To observe the stability of the prepared nanoparticles and nanoemulsion, they were dispersed in DIW and their size distribution in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-00824-f005">Figure 5</xref> was measured as a function of time. Based on the particle size DM-ZnO-Try NE was found to be stable up to 5 days, whereas the NPs slightly started to swell and found an increase in the particle size due to the difference in amphiphilic nature of the material. However, the size is constant up to day 5 for prepared nanoemulsion, which is found to have higher stability due to the loading of tryptophan product and its binding nature. This confirms its safety and stability for longer circulation in physiological conditions.
