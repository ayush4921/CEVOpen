 <xref rid="materials-14-00824-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> along with water and oil (olive oil). The nanoformulation system of W/O or O/W is determined by the composition of the surfactant, water, and oil. Around 50–90% of the water with 1.5–10% of the surfactant is considerate for oil in the water method. The higher the concentration of the surfactant, the higher the toxicity of the material so we considered the safe proportion of 5%

 <italic>w</italic> for our composition. The nanoformulation system was determined by W/O or O/W based on the composition of the olive oil, water, and surfactant. A recently reported composition of 90% water around 10% of the surfactant was found to be suitable for this stable formulation [
 <xref rid="B25-materials-14-00824" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Initial visual observation was made for the coagulation behavior of the three different concentration nanoparticles. After a day, sample 1 and sample 3 turned slowly towards milky and translucent, whereas sample S2 showed stability for more than 2 days at 25 °C and 40 °C. Further, to check the precipitation ability of S2, it was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 30 min and no precipitation was observed. Based on the initial screening, we further proceeded with the preparation of nanoemulsion using tryptophan for our preparation. For understanding the stability of the prepared nanoparticle and nanoemulsion, size correlation measurements were performed over 10 days using DLS measurements. The stability difference is mainly due to the nature of the materials, interactions due to the binding materials, and the composition of the oil, water, and surfactants. The DLS data suggests that the formulation of nanoemulsion is homogenetic with a low polydispersity value for excellent stable formulation. For further experiments, S2 was chosen based on the preliminary results. DM-ZnO-Try NE contains 75% aqueous part containing 75.0 mg of DM-ZnO NPs and olive oil (8%) and a surfactant (7%) and was also loaded with 5% tryptophan (25.0 mg).
