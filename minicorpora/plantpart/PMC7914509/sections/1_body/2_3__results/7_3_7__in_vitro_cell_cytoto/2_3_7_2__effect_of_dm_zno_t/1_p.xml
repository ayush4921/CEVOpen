<p>To test whether DM-ZnO-Try NE inhibits intracellular triglyceride accumulation, complete media containing insulin, dexamethasone, and IBMX was used to induce 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation in the presence or absence of 10 mg/mL different samples in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-00824-f010">Figure 10</xref>A–F (control, positive control, DM extract, DM-ZnO NPs, DM-ZnO-Try NE, and Try, respectively). On day 13, excess lipid accumulation was observed inside the differentiated positive control cells. The DM-ZnO-Try NE treated cells had lesser lipid droplets compared to the positive control. Lipid accumulation and the occurrence of the adipocyte phenotype of the matured adipocyte cells were then assessed by staining with Oil Red O. The microscopic observation of the Oil Red O stained cells shows in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-14-00824-f010">Figure 10</xref>G that the lipid accumulation was notably decreased by DM-ZnO-Try NE samples. The results were quantified by measuring the absorbance of the solubilized stained lipid droplets at 520 nm. The results showed that the treatment with different samples (DM extract, DM-ZnO NPs, DM-ZnO-Try NE, and Try) at 10 mg/mL and DM-ZnO-Try NE resulted in notable reductions of lipid accumulation in the cells in
