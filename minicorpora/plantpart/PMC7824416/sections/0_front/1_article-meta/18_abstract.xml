 <p>At present, organic crops have reached an important boom in a society increasingly interested in the conservation of the environment and sustainability. It is evident that a part of the population in the Western world focuses their concern on how to obtain our food and on doing it in a way that is as respectful as possible with the environment.

Given the collected works, the efficacy of essential oils for their use as pesticides for agricultural use is evident.</p>
