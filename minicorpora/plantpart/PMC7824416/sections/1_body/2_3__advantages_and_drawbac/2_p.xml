<p>Essential oils-based biopesticides present some advantages for crop protection. Numerous essential oils, that have a large number of plants, cover a wide spectrum of activities against pest insects and pathogenic fungi [

 <xref rid="B76-antibiotics-10-00034" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. They present a low persistence in the medium due to its high volatility [

Besides this, the most essential oils are reasonably nontoxic to mammals and aquatic life and they can be classified as low-risk pesticides [
 <xref rid="B75-antibiotics-10-00034" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>], in other words, essential oils could present low toxicity against non-target organisms [
 <xref rid="B76-antibiotics-10-00034" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Another advantage of this group of compounds is that some essentials oils are available in large measure, due to this, the commercialization of pesticides based on essential oils is possible [
