<p>Although essential oils (and biopesticides in general) have shown many advantages over the use of traditional/conventional pesticides, they present several disadvantages. At the commercial level, not many kinds of this product have arisen in the market, probably due to the high cost of necessary evaluations (toxicology and environmental) [
 <xref rid="B75-antibiotics-10-00034" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] because the authorization processes of these biopesticides (botanical pesticides) are complex [

Besides, essential oils are a complex mixture of compounds (beneficial effect to slow down resistance [
