<p>To finish, Pavela and Benelli [
 <xref rid="B76-antibiotics-10-00034" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] reported that there are numerous studies centered on the biological activity of essential oils on target organisms, nevertheless, it would be necessary to further research toxicological studies and the possible effects of their use on non-target ones. Furthermore, according to the same authors [
 <xref rid="B76-antibiotics-10-00034" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>], the mechanisms of action and other properties of interest have not yet been clarified. Despite this, the authors report that based on the existing toxicological studies, it can be concluded that the most essential oils can be considered safe (for human and the environment) in the concentrations or doses commonly used, and based on this, the legislation could be simplified and establish a greater partnership between research and the manufacturers of botanical pesticides [
