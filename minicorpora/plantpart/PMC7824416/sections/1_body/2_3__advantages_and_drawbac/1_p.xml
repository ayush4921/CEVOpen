<p>Many studies have shown that different constituents of essential oils can present antibacterial and antifungal properties so that there are real possibilities to used essential oils for plants and crop protection. These kinds of products, made based on essential oils, could be considered as biopesticides. However, different authors suggest that the term “biopesticide” should be reserved only for living organisms (biological agents) [
