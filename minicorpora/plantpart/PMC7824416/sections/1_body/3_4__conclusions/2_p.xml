<p>Their possible use presents, as expected, advantages for the environment such as their volatility (less persistent than other synthetic chemicals) or that they are a new alternative to the resistance to synthetic chemicals by organisms. As main drawbacks, those related to their availability, the high cost of the authorization processes, their low persistence, and less effective action. On the other hand, it is necessary to determine their optimal ratio and dosages to improve their efficacy and decrease their toxicity, all these aimed to have sufficient scientific information to be able to be safely marketed.</p>
