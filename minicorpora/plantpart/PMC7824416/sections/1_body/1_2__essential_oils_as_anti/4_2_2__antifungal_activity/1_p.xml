<p>Essential oils have also been presented in antifungal properties. The fungal diseases can have different consequences on plants such as alterations in their physiology, disturb their usual functioning, reduce their performance and, even, sometimes the loss of the plant [

 <xref rid="B59-antibiotics-10-00034" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], their action mechanisms is unknown but can be linked to their capacity to dissolve/disrupt the integrity of the fungiâ€™s membranes and cell walls. According to Arraiza et al. [
 <xref rid="B58-antibiotics-10-00034" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], in different studies, the antifungal properties are based on the inhibition of fungal mycelial growth in vitro. However, it is necessary to be careful with the use of essential oils because many of these oils (and their pure compounds) can present high phytotoxicity for plants (even in concentrations slightly higher than those necessary for the control of fungi), possibly due to plant cells being affected by the same mechanism [
