<p>Chemically, essential oils are complex mixtures of more than 100 components [

 <xref rid="B22-antibiotics-10-00034" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], but they are mainly made up of terpenic compounds [
 <xref rid="B23-antibiotics-10-00034" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Terpenoids, sometimes called isoprenoids, are a broad family of natural compounds derived from isoprene [
 <xref rid="B24-antibiotics-10-00034" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. About 60% of known natural products are terpenoids [
 <xref rid="B25-antibiotics-10-00034" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. This class of secondary compounds (essential oils) contains different terpenoids such as monoterpenes (C

 <xref rid="B26-antibiotics-10-00034" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] contain two isoprene units (linear or cyclic [
 <xref rid="B26-antibiotics-10-00034" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]) like myrcene, menthol, limonene, or linalool (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-10-00034-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Other important components of essential oils are the sesquiterpenes which consist of three isoprene units (C

 <xref rid="B26-antibiotics-10-00034" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-10-00034-f001">Figure 1</xref> shows some different sesquiterpenes such as patchoulol or nootkatone (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-10-00034-f001">Figure 1</xref>). According to the information reported by Martinez (2003) [
 <xref rid="B11-antibiotics-10-00034" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], monoterpenoids are common in the Primulales, Ranunculales, and Violales orders (being scarcer in other different orders such as Asterales, Cornales, Lamiales, and Rutales) and sesquiterpenoids are mainly abundant in other orders such as Asterales, Cornales, Magnoliales, and Rutales [
 <xref rid="B11-antibiotics-10-00034" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Essential oils can also contain diterpenes (as by-product) [
 <xref rid="B26-antibiotics-10-00034" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] which are composed of four isoprene units -as retinal or phytol-. Finally, essential oils contain other compounds such as aromatic phenols, ethers, esters, alcohols, among others, which will confer the aroma and odor of the plant [
