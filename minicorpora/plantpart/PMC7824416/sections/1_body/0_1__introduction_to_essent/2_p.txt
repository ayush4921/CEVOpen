3: Indeed, and according to Turek and Stintzing [ 1], they are a viable environmental-friendly alternative in these fields due to their proved capacity as nematicidal [ 12, 13], antimicrobial [ 14, 15], insecticidal [ 16], antifungal [ 15, 17] or, even, herbicidal and insect repellent [ 18].
4: Besides this, essential oils show antioxidant activity (that can be used in edible products or active packaging) [ 19], anticancer properties [ 20], and properties for pain or inflammation treatment [ 21].
