0: Chemically, essential oils are complex mixtures of more than 100 components [ 5, 11, 22], but they are mainly made up of terpenic compounds [ 23].
1: Terpenoids, sometimes called isoprenoids, are a broad family of natural compounds derived from isoprene [ 24].
2: About 60% of known natural products are terpenoids [ 25].
3: This class of secondary compounds (essential oils) contains different terpenoids such as monoterpenes (C 10) [ 18, 26] contain two isoprene units (linear or cyclic [ 26]) like myrcene, menthol, limonene, or linalool (see  Figure 1).
4: Other important components of essential oils are the sesquiterpenes which consist of three isoprene units (C 15) [ 18, 26].
5: Figure 1 shows some different sesquiterpenes such as patchoulol or nootkatone (see  Figure 1).
6: According to the information reported by Martinez (2003) [ 11], monoterpenoids are common in the Primulales, Ranunculales, and Violales orders (being scarcer in other different orders such as Asterales, Cornales, Lamiales, and Rutales) and sesquiterpenoids are mainly abundant in other orders such as Asterales, Cornales, Magnoliales, and Rutales [ 11].
7: Essential oils can also contain diterpenes (as by-product) [ 26] which are composed of four isoprene units -as retinal or phytol-.
8: Finally, essential oils contain other compounds such as aromatic phenols, ethers, esters, alcohols, among others, which will confer the aroma and odor of the plant [ 18].
