<p>According to the ISO 9235 from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the essential oil can be obtained by distillation by any of its variants: hydrodistillation, steam distillation, or dry distillation and by mechanical processes [
 <xref rid="B2-antibiotics-10-00034" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Some of these distillation methods are widely reported in the literature [
 <xref rid="B7-antibiotics-10-00034" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-antibiotics-10-00034" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-antibiotics-10-00034" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-antibiotics-10-00034" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], even some variants such as distillation with cohobation [
 <xref rid="B8-antibiotics-10-00034" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] have been reported. Because essential oils are responsible for the aroma of plants, they are widely known for their use in cosmetics and perfumery, but they are also an important resource in other industrial fields such as pharmaceutical, food, among others [

 <xref rid="B4-antibiotics-10-00034" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,

 <xref rid="B11-antibiotics-10-00034" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Indeed, and according to Turek and Stintzing [
 <xref rid="B1-antibiotics-10-00034" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], they are a viable environmental-friendly alternative in these fields due to their proved capacity as nematicidal [

 <xref rid="B15-antibiotics-10-00034" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], insecticidal [

 <xref rid="B17-antibiotics-10-00034" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] or, even, herbicidal and insect repellent [
 <xref rid="B18-antibiotics-10-00034" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Besides this, essential oils show antioxidant activity (that can be used in edible products or active packaging) [
 <xref rid="B19-antibiotics-10-00034" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], anticancer properties [
 <xref rid="B20-antibiotics-10-00034" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and properties for pain or inflammation treatment [
