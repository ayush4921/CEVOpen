<p>Essential oil is a term reserved for those compounds that are defined by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) [
 <xref rid="B1-antibiotics-10-00034" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] in their ISO 9235 [
 <xref rid="B2-antibiotics-10-00034" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These kinds of compounds are complex mixtures originated from the secondary metabolism [
 <xref rid="B3-antibiotics-10-00034" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B4-antibiotics-10-00034" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], produced by the glandular trichomes, and in different secretory structures [
 <xref rid="B4-antibiotics-10-00034" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5-antibiotics-10-00034" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. They can be composed by terpenes, associated or not to other components, generally volatile and that provides an odor to the vegetable [
 <xref rid="B6-antibiotics-10-00034" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These compounds have (with exceptions) a density lower than water density [
 <xref rid="B5-antibiotics-10-00034" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-antibiotics-10-00034" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and are usually presented in liquid form [
 <xref rid="B5-antibiotics-10-00034" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-antibiotics-10-00034" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Besides, essential oils are hydrophobic compounds, soluble in alcohol (among others) and only a little soluble in water [
