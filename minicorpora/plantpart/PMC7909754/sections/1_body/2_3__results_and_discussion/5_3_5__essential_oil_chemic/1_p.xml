<p>The wheat grain is composed of several layers. The most external ones are known as bran, and they are mainly constituted by fiber, but they also contain other compounds like lignins, oligosaccharides, phytic acids, polyphenols, phenolic acids, and other trace compounds [

 <xref rid="B10-foods-10-00213" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11-foods-10-00213" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], the 
 <italic>A. mexicana</italic> and 
 <italic>B. perfoliata</italic> essential oil constituents are mainly mono- and sesquiterpenes, while fatty acids and the diterpene phytol are the main compounds in 
 <italic>P. linaria</italic> essential oil. Taking into consideration the nature of these compounds, it is expected that the essential oils will remain on the bran layer because of compound similarities. These interactions are likely intermolecular forces like hydrogen bonds or dipole interactions. Thus, the adsorption of the essential oils on the bran layer protects the whole grain against the fungi with limited penetration of the compounds towards the internal layers with limited effects on the flour quality.
