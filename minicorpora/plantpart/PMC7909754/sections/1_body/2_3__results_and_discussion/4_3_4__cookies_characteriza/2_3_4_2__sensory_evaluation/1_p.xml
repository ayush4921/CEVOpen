<p>The triangular test was the method chosen for this evaluation, using the minimal number of correct judgments table to establish significant differences [
 <xref rid="B22-foods-10-00213" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. According to this table, for a panel of 30 referees, at least 15 of them must identify differences among the cookies to conclude that there is a significant difference. Results showed that the number of judgments could not reach the number 15, suggesting that there were no significant differences between cookies made with flour obtained from grains treated vs. untreated grains.
