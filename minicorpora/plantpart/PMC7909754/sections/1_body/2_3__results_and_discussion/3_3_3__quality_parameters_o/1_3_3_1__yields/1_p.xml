<p>Flour yields were approximately 47% for all samples. The yield of the flours derived from essential oil-treated grains was 46%, while flours considered as blank, positive, and negative controls yielded 47, 46, and 47%, respectively. These results indicate that essential oils had no effects on flour yields. These yields were low compared to the normal yield obtained in industrial flours, which varies between 72â€“78% [
