<p>Evaluation of the rheological properties of the dough is an important factor that evaluates the flour quality because it studies the physical properties of the hydrated gluten that is formed during kneading [
 <xref rid="B17-foods-10-00213" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The behavior of dough during kneading can be predicted from the farinograms. Typical bread flour presents stability of 10 min and a developing time of 3 min, while the content of water ranges between 55–60% [
