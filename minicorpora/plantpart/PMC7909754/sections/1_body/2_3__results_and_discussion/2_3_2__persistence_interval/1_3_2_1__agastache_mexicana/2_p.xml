<p>The Log-Y Sq-X model was used to fit the observed behavior, where “Y” is the amount of the essential oil, represented by the sum of all GC peak areas; and “X” is the number of days of the experiment. With an R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.9098 and RMSE of 2.17 × 10
 <sup>6</sup>, the equation that represents the model is 
 <disp-formula>EO amount as GC peak areas = exp(16.9806 − 0.000558591 * Day #^2).</disp-formula>
