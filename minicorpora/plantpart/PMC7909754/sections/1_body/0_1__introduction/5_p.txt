0: Recently, we reported the antifungal activity of essential oils extracted from the plants  Porophyllum linaria,  Agastache mexicana ssp.
1: xolocotziana, and  Buddleja perfoliata [ 10, 11].
2: These essential oils showed significant activity against fungal strains isolated from stored wheat grains with no significant cytotoxic effects on mammalian cells tested in an ex vivo model using macrophages derived from human monocytes (THP-1 cells) [ 10, 11].
3: To further advance the applications of these oils, we added them to wheat grains and after about two months, we proceeded to obtain the flour from these treated grains and elaborate dough to assess its quality for baking.
4: The persistence interval of each essential oil was also determined to see their persistence in wheat grains and to predict their behavior over time through appropriated mathematical models.
