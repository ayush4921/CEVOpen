<p>Grains are harvested and stored with a variety of organisms, including bacteria, fungi, and insects. These organisms represent a potential concern if grains are not processed properly before their storage. One example is a fast deterioration of their quality, affecting not only the nutritional value but also generating odors and color changes which may affect their milling and baking qualities. </p>
