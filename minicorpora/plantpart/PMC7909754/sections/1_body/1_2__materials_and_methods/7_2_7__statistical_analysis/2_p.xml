<p>In the case of persistence interval, a simple regression analysis was applied to the oil quantity data (measured as an area of the chromatogram) based on the elapsed days from the moment of the impregnation of the wheat grain, which is considered the zero-day. The data were tried to fit 27 different curvilinear models, choosing the one with the highest R
 <sup>2</sup>. In this way, the mathematical model that best predicts the persistence interval of each of the essential oils was obtained.
