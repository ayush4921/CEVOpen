<p>Wheat grains (3.5 kg) were manually cleaned, placed in a 6 L beaker, and mixed with a solution of essential oils dissolved in acetone. Final concentrations of 30 μg/mL were used for 
 <italic>A. mexicana</italic>, whereas 0.69 and 50 μg/mL were used for 
 <italic>P. linaria</italic> and 
 <italic>B. perfoliata</italic>, respectively reported [

 <xref rid="B11-foods-10-00213" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These concentrations represent the reported minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) against the same fungal strains and are expressed as µg of essential oil/g of grain in this study. The solution of the essential oil was homogenously distributed using a micropipette. After 1 h of the essential oil application, the beakers were capped with a piece of aluminum foil, sealed, and stored in a chamber with controlled temperature and moisture of 25 °C and 50%, respectively. A solution of the fungicide difenoconazole (30 μg/mL in acetone) was used as the positive control, while untreated grains and grains impregnated with acetone were used as negative controls. All grain samples were stored for a period of 8 weeks after which the grains were conditioned for milling by increasing their humidity until reaching 16%. The milling was carried out at the laboratories of MEJORPLUS Company (Puebla, Mexico). Experiments were performed in triplicate.
