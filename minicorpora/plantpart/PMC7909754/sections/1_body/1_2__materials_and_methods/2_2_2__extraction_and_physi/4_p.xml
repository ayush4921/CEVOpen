<p>The color of the essential oils was determined by a portable Konica Minolta colorimeter (CR-400, New York, NY, USA) following the method 58-12.01 [
 <xref rid="B12-foods-10-00213" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The transmittance mode was used for the two liquid essential oils (
 <italic>A. mexicana</italic> and 
 <italic>B. perfoliata</italic>) using the following color parameters: L * (luminosity, white-black), a * (green-red), and b * (blue-yellow) in the Hunter scale. The colorimeter was calibrated using the black mosaic and the calibration parameters: L * = 100, a * = 0, and b * = 0. The measurements were performed in a quartz cell. In the case of the semisolid oil from 
 <italic>P. linaria</italic> as well as the flours and cookies detailed below, the same parameters were measured but using the CIELab scale. The colorimeter was calibrated using the white standard mosaic (L * = 94.43, a * = âˆ’1.03 y b * = +0.80). Colors of the essential oils, flours, and cookies were measured in triplicate.
