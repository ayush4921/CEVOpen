<p>In this work, the persistence interval of essential oils is defined as the time that all or some of the initial constituents of the essential oil remain in the wheat grain. The persistence interval was determined as follows: 4 g of wheat grains were placed in a glass vial, filling only one-third of its volume. On the other hand, an acetone solution of the corresponding oil was prepared in enough amount to obtain a final concentration equal to the highest minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC, µg of oil/g of wheat) as previously reported [

Subsequently, with the help of a micropipette, the wheat grains were impregnated with the appropriate amount of solution homogeneously distributed among the grains. The bottles were covered in a non-hermetic manner with aluminum foil and stored in a chamber with controlled temperature and relative humidity at 25 °C and 50%, respectively, with a photoperiod of 12 h of light and 12 h of darkness. The wheat grain impregnated with difenoconazole dissolved in acetone (30 µg/mL) was used as a positive control, while the negative controls were the wheat grains alone (untreated) and the wheat grains impregnated with acetone. Triplicate tests were performed and analyzed weekly by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). For the chromatographic analysis, a Varian-CP3800 gas chromatograph (San Diego, CA, USA) coupled to a Varian-4000 mass detector (San Diego, CA, USA), in Head Space mode and a VF-5 ms, 30 m long, 0.25 mm in diameter and 0.25 µm thick, capillary column was used, with helium as carrier gas (1.0 mL/min). The temperature ramp in the column was started at 60 °C for 2 min, increased to 280 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min, maintaining the temperature for 6 min. A volume of 1 mL of the oil vapors was injected into the column in splitless mode, using a Pal System autosampler (Combi Pal RF546 model). The autosampler was programmed with GC Head Space injection mode using a 1 mL syringe; the temperature of the syringe was 60 °C and that of the agitator was 180 °C, with incubation of 3 min and a stirring cycle of 2 s at 500 rpm and waiting for 4 s. The injector temperature was set at 250 °C. The mass spectrometer was operated at 70 eV, and the mass range was 40 to 425 uma. The persistence interval of each of the essential oils was evaluated by comparing the sum of the area of all peaks corresponding to the essential oil on day zero (beginning of the experiment) and that corresponding on the day of control. The persistence interval was evaluated for 7 weeks.
