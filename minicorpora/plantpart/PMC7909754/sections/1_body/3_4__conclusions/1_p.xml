<p>Here, we present data related to the effect of 
 <italic>A. mexicana</italic>, 
 <italic>B. perfoliata</italic>, and 
 <italic>P. linaria</italic> essential oils on the behavior of flours, showing no significant effect on the dough quality. In the case of cookies, there were no significant differences compared to the untreated flours regarding water activity, moisture, hardness, or color parameters, as well as no significant differences found in the sensory evaluation. In addition, we provide evidence that 90% of the constituents of the essential oils are lost in 63â€“134 days post-treatment, and according to the type of the essential oil.
