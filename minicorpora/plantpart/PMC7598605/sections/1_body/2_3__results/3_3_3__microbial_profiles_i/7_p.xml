<p>The amount of predominant bacterial species in the ileum of the control group was quite equally distributed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="animals-10-01734-f005">Figure 5</xref>A). The highest number of a single species (
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>) in this group was 10.5%, while the numbers of other prevalent species differed only slightly. In the experimental group, on the contrary, there were two species whose numbers were much higher, compared with the rest. The highly predominant species in this group were 
 <italic>Escherichia coli,</italic> with the prevalence of 32%, and 
 <italic>Lactobacillus amylovorus,</italic> with the prevalence of 17%. Despite that, the amounts of separate bacterial species were different between the groups, the general variety of species was quite similar, except for few species (
 <italic>Alloprevotella rava</italic>, 
 <italic>Prevotella stercorea</italic>, and 
 <italic>Bacteroides stercoris</italic>), which were absent in the experimental group.
