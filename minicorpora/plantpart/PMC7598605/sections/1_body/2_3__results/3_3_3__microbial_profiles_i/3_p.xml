<p>At the end of the experiment, the variety of species in large intestines was similar in both groups. The number of species in the caecum in both groups was 300, including unclassified species with the prevalence of at least 0.01% from all bacterial reads. The number of bacterial species was very similar in the colon as well (289 and 297 species in the control and experimental groups, respectively). Statistically significant differences were detected in the terminal ileum, where the number of species was much higher in the control group (220 vs. 125 species) of pigs. Microbial profiles at the genus level in different intestines at the end of the experiment are presented in
