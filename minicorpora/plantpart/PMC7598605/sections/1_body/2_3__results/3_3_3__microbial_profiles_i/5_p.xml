<p>Bacterial composition in the caecum content was more similar between the groups, compared with other intestines.

 <italic>Gemmiger</italic>,

 <italic>Barnesiella,</italic> which was more than 12 times higher in the control group, while in the experimental group 
 <italic>Prevotella</italic> was the most abundant genus. The other genera with a higher prevalence in the experimental group were 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic> (7% vs. 3.2%) and 
 <italic>Collinsella</italic> (4.7% vs. 3%), while in the control group, higher numbers were observed in

 <italic>Gemmiger</italic> (3.9% vs. 1.9%) (

 <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> in the caecum content between the groups (2.5% vs. 2.6%,

 <italic>Streptococcus</italic>,

 <italic>Clostridium</italic> and 
 <italic>Barnesiella,</italic> whose amount was more than a half of all bacterial loads within this part of the GIT. The amount of 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic> was very high (31.3%), compared with the other genera in this group. In the experimental group, the most prevalent genus was 
 <italic>Prevotella</italic> (31.9%), followed by 
 <italic>Barnesiella</italic> (9.4%) and 
 <italic>Alloprevotella</italic> (5.1%). The highest differences were detected among the numbers of
