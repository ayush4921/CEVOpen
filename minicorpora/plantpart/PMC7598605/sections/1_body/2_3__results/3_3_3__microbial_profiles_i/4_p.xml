<p>When comparing bacterial composition in the ileum, high differences were observed between the groups. In the control group, the highest amount of bacteria was observed in populations of 
 <italic>Clostridium</italic> (16.3%), 
 <italic>Escherichia</italic> (10.6%), 
 <italic>Alloprevotella</italic> (8.3%), and 
 <italic>Actinobacillus</italic> (7.5%), while the distribution of genera was quite equal (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="animals-10-01734-f004">Figure 4</xref>A). In the experimental group, the bacterial amount of four genera was much higher, compared with the numbers of microorganisms of other genera detected in the ileum content. In this case, the most prevalent genera were 
 <italic>Escherichia</italic> (32.2%), 
 <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> (27.4%), 
 <italic>Clostridium</italic> (17.1%), and 
 <italic>Terrisporobacter</italic> (9%). The prevalence of those four genera was 85.7% of all bacterial loads.
