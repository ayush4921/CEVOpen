<p>Cell viability in all tested cell lines did not fall below 99% in the 1 µL/mL exposure group. Except for PK-15 cell line, where the exposure to 5 µL/mL of oregano extract, mint essential oil (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="animals-10-01734-f002">Figure 2</xref>H) resulted in cell viability of around 98%, cell viability did not fall below 99% in the 5 µL/mL exposure group. In the 10 µL/mL exposure group, only MARC-145 cells exposed to thyme essential oil showed cell viability lower than 98% (

Interestingly, while cell viability in all tested cell lines did not fall below 97% in the 20 µL/mL exposure group, in the 25 µL/mL exposure group, a 5 µL/mL difference resulted in cell viability falling below 97% in MARC-145 cells exposed to the mixture of all components (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="animals-10-01734-f002">Figure 2</xref>D), Vero cells exposed to oregano extract (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="animals-10-01734-f002">Figure 2</xref>I) and PK-15 cells exposed to oregano extract (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="animals-10-01734-f002">Figure 2</xref>E). While the cell viability of the majority tested cell lines did not fall below 96% at 50 µL/mL exposure concentrations, MARC-145 cells exposed to oregano extract (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="animals-10-01734-f002">Figure 2</xref>A) reached cell viability of 92.67% (CI95% 97.33–88.01), Vero cells exposed to mint essential oil (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="animals-10-01734-f002">Figure 2</xref>J) reached cell viability of 93.67% (CI95% 98.33–89.01), while PK-15 cells exposed to thyme essential oil (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="animals-10-01734-f002">Figure 2</xref>G) and the mixture of all compounds (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="animals-10-01734-f002">Figure 2</xref>H) reached cell viability of 94.67% (CI95% 99.33–90.01) and 94.00% (CI95% 98.66–89.34), respectively.
