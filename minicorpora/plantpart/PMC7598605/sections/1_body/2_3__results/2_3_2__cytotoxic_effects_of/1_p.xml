<p>The results of cell cultures viability tests obtained using different bioactive compounds and their mixtures, demonstrated that the oregano extract, mint essential oil, thyme essential oil, and the mixtures of all the tested compounds in concentrations of 1–50 µL/mL did not show any cytotoxic effect after 48 h in MARC-145, PK-15 and Vero cell lines. Cytotoxic effects of the extracts on the viability of cell cultures are summarized in
