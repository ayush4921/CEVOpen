<p>One of the most important questions raised in this study was to evaluate the influence of EEOs on the amount of probiotic bacteria in the GI tract of pigs. The data demonstrated that pigs receiving EEOs supplements had a higher amount of bacteria that are considered as probiotics, including 
 <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>, 
 <italic>Bacillus</italic>, 
 <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic>, and 
 <italic>Escherichia</italic>. Only 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic> and 
 <italic>Enterococcus,</italic> which are also probiotic species, were more numerous in the control group of pigs. The overall number of probiotic bacteria in the experimental group was 1.2 times higher compared to controls and accounted for 27% of the total amount of bacterial reads in the gut of pigs. The number of 
 <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> was 2.5 times higher, while the number of 
 <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> was 1.9 times higher in the experimental group. The amount of 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic>, however, was four times higher in the control group. As the lactic acid bacteria, including 
 <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> and 
 <italic>Bifidobacterium,</italic> are among the better described probiotic bacteria, the role of streptococci for the host is less investigated. This genus is mostly known as a pathogenic for pigs causing different diseases and, particularly,

 <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> and 
 <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> are the genera already known as suppressors of cell proliferation in tumors; their action is associated with oxidative stress [

Although EOs anticancer potential is known by acting by multiple pathways and mechanisms, involving apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, antimetastatic and antiangiogenic action, increased levels of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS), and DNA repair modulation [
