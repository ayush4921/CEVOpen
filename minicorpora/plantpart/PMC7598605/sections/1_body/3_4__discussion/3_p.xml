<p>Differences between microbial changes within the same animal group at the beginning and at the end of the experiment were recorded. While the main prevalent bacterial genera in both groups at the beginning of the experiment were 
 <italic>Prevotella</italic>, 
 <italic>Clostridium</italic>, 
 <italic>Barnesiella</italic>, and 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic>, at the end of the experiment the most prevalent genera were 
 <italic>Clostridium</italic>, 
 <italic>Escherichia</italic>, 
 <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Terrisporobacter</italic> in the content of jejuni. In the large intestine, such differences were unequal: in caecum of the control group, 
 <italic>Prevotella</italic> and 
 <italic>Barnesiella</italic> predominated, whereas in the experimental group, the most prevalent were 
 <italic>Prevotella</italic> and 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic>. In the colon, the most prevalent genera were 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic>, 
 <italic>Prevotella</italic>, 
 <italic>Clostridium</italic>, and 
 <italic>Barnesiella</italic> in the control group and 
 <italic>Prevotella</italic>, 
 <italic>Barnesiella</italic>, and 
 <italic>Oligosphaera</italic> in the experimental group. In spite of the fact that certain differences were determined between the groups at the end of the experiment, the same genera were detected in both groups only with different proportional count.
