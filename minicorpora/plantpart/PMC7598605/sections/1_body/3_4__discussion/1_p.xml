<p>We studied the influence of the composition of EOs to microbial profiles in different intestines using pig model. Two animal groups used in this experiment came from the same litters, they had similar microbial profiles at the beginning of the experiment. At that period of age, the most prevalent bacterial classes in piglet faces were 
 <italic>Bacteroidia</italic> (phylum Bacteroidetes) and 
 <italic>Clostridia</italic> (phylum Firmicutes), whose prevalence varied from 69.4% to 72.1% depending on the animal group, and this is in coincidence with data obtained by other authors [

 <xref rid="B54-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The main genera included 
 <italic>Prevotella</italic>, 
 <italic>Clostridium</italic>, 
 <italic>Barnesiella</italic>, and 
 <italic>Streptococcus,</italic> i.e., normal microbiota usually found in healthy pigs [
