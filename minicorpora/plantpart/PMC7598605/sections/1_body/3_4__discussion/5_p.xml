<p>Our previous experiments with separate ingredients and intended for development of nutraceutical formulations have demonstrated good results in vitro, regarding antimicrobial activity of lactic acid bacteria, berries/fruit- by-products and EOs, which demonstrated bacteriostatic or bactericidal effect against wide spectrum of field pathogens [

Current experiment in vivo demonstrated a positive effect of EEOs on the microbiota of the GI tract without reducing variety of species in the large intestine and increasing the number of probiotic bacteria. The study also demonstrated that EEOs combination has no cytotoxic effect at high concentrations (up to 50 ÂµL/mL). The minimum inhibitory concentrations of EOs on different pathogenic strains in our previous study were lower [
 <xref rid="B5-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] than concentrations which had no cytotoxic effect established in the present study. As there was a decrease of some probiotic bacteria, in particular, gram-positive cocci, more data are required about the possible action of the current EEOs combination on this group of bacteria and about the role of 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic> spp. in the gut of vertebrates. Moreover, as the EEOs had a certain negative impact on species variety in the ileum, studies on the role of minor species of bacteria in small intestine should be further studied.
