0: By above-mentioned reasons, EOs are promising substances for the treatment and prophylaxis of infectious diseases both in humans and animals.
1: Recent experiments demonstrated that EOs are active against wide spectrum of antimicrobial resistant isolates including methicillin-resistant  Staphylococcus aureus, extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, and carbapenemases-producing  Enterobacteriaceae isolated from humans and animals [ 5, 13].
2: Moreover, EOs have shown promise as antiviral agents against several pathogenic viruses [ 14].
3: Different studies in animals and humans suggest that EOs have immune function enhancing or immune function balancing properties [ 15].
4: EOs have been successfully applied as feed additives to broiler chickens or weaned piglets and have clearly shown immunostimulatory effects [ 16].
5: EOs are rich sources of natural antioxidants, such as the phenolic compounds and due their high redox properties and chemical structure have the ability to neutralize free radicals, chelate transitional metals, and quench singlet and triplet oxygen by delocalization or decomposition of peroxides both in humans and animals [ 17, 18, 19].
6: These properties of EOs can benefit both human and animal health.
