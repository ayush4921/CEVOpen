0: It is known that EOs can act on the gut microbiota selectively.
1: For instance, a cocktail of carvacrol, cinnamaldehyde, and capsicum oleoresin increased the population of  Lactobacilli and the ratio of  Lactobacilli to  Enterobacteriaceae in the jejunum and cecum of early-weaned piglets [ 29].
2: The way EOs active substances can modify microbial composition is very important as it is known that the microbiota plays a fundamental role in the induction, training, and functioning of the host immune system [ 30].
3: It also actively participates in the digestion process.
4: Bacteria belonging to phylum Firmicutes are able to digest long-chain carbohydrates and thus provide the host with additional sources of nutrients [ 31].
5: In addition to its positive role, microbiota has a potential in the development of irritable bowel disease and some other diseases, as well as obesity [ 32].
6: It may also elaborate toxic products from food residues such as genotoxic hydrogen sulphide [ 33].
7: As the microbiota has the potential to play different roles in the gut of the host, it is very important to explore the key elements influencing the domination of beneficial bacteria over the pathogenic ones or those that may have a negative impact on health.
8: Different EOs have been investigated regarding their antimicrobial and functional properties.
9: The previous investigations proved that the potential of activity of different EOs is not equal [ 34]; therefore, the selection of an appropriate EOs with the aim to obtain the most active (or optimal) composition is very important.
