<p>By above-mentioned reasons, EOs are promising substances for the treatment and prophylaxis of infectious diseases both in humans and animals. Recent experiments demonstrated that EOs are active against wide spectrum of antimicrobial resistant isolates including methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, and carbapenemases-producing 
 <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> isolated from humans and animals [

EOs are rich sources of natural antioxidants, such as the phenolic compounds and due their high redox properties and chemical structure have the ability to neutralize free radicals, chelate transitional metals, and quench singlet and triplet oxygen by delocalization or decomposition of peroxides both in humans and animals [

 <xref rid="B19-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. These properties of EOs can benefit both human and animal health.
