 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> plant extract and 
 <italic>Mentha piperita</italic> and 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> essential oils, alone and in combination, had no cytotoxic effect at concentrations up to 50 µL/mL after 48 h in MARC-145, PK-15, and Vero cell lines. The combination of these essential oils given to pigs orally in a form of tablet with bilayer coating, prepared by “liquid/solid” phase technology, resulted in the increase of probiotic bacteria in jejunum, caecum and colon using an experimental pig model.
