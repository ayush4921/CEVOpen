<p>The innovative technology in the “liquid/solid” phase of the system has been used to improve the bioavailability of sparingly water-soluble active compounds (thyme and mint essential oils) and has been used for powder production. In the “liquid/solid” phase of the system, the technology was carried out: using a simple mixing method, where the solution of active ingredients and excipients were mixed until the formation of suitable powder properties. Magnesium aluminum metasilicate was chosen as the carrier for powder production in the “liquid/solid” phase. The carrier and the mixture of ethanolic oregano extract and mint and thyme essential oils were mixed together in a mortar, sieved through a 1 mm sieve and homogenized for 10 min in a mixer. The prepared mixture was placed in an oven at 60 °C for 1 h, the procedure being repeated until all the solution has been used. The prepared mixture was placed in a ventilated dryer at 40 °C for 24 h. After drying, a free-flowing, yellowish powder was obtained. Chromatographic analysis showed that the amounts of the main biologically active compounds, thymol, carvacrol and menthol, were not significantly reduced in the powder formulations. The liquid/solid powder was further used in the tableting process. The resulting bulk and high-quality powder was tableted into mini-tablets, which are coated with a bilayer coating for different relaxation in the GIT. </p>
