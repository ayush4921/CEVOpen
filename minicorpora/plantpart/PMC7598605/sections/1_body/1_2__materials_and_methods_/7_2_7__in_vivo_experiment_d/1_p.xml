<p>In vivo experiment was performed using 16 weaned-off 17–19 kg Lithuanian White breed 56-day-old pigs in September 2019. Pigs were bred and delivered from the large capacity pig breeding farm to the Biological Research Centre of Lithuanian University of Health Sciences keeping requirements of animal welfare. Animals were selected from the same two related litters, with the aim to obtain individuals with more similar physiological parameters including body weight. All animal procedures were conducted according to the EU Directive of the European Parliament and of Council from 22 September 2010 [
 <xref rid="B47-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes and Requirements for the Keeping, Maintenance, and Use of Animals Intended for Science and Education Purposes (2010/63/EU), approved by the order of the Director of the Lithuanian State Food and Veterinary Service [
 <xref rid="B48-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The number of permission for this study is G2-123. The animals were divided into two groups (control group and experimental group), eight pigs (four males and four females) in each group in separate pens within the same room. All animals were fed regular animal feed, which was prepared according to the standard recipes. Regular feed consisted of barley (44.6%), wheat (20%), soybean meal (7.9%), whey powder (6.5%), corn (5%), soybean protein (3%), sugar beet pulp (3%), and potato protein (2%). Before experiment, the animals were kept in pens for 5 days for adaptation. All animals in the experimental group additionally received ~1 g of the preparation (3 tablets) daily, during the morning feeding until the end of the experiment. This corresponds to 986 mg of oregano extract, 3 mg of peppermint essential oil and 7 mg thyme essential oil. The preparation was added to the feed ensuring that it was consumed by each animal. Duration of the experiment was 30 days. Twenty-four hours before the experiment, fecal content from the rectum was taken for microbiome studies for the comparison of microbial variety among the groups. On the 30th day, the experiment was finished, and animals were sedated and euthanized according to the requirements laid down in the Directive.2010/63/EU. The content (5 g) from the distal part of the ileum, caecum and the central part of the colon was taken into sterile DNase and RNase free tubes, delivered to the Institute of Microbiology and Virology, where specimens were preserved using DNA/RNA Shield (Zymo Research, Irvine, USA) and stored at −20 °C. The material was used for microbiome studies in experimental and control animal groups.
