<p>The composition analysis of essential oils and tablets was performed using a Shimadzu GC-2010 gas chromatograph (Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a Shimadzu autoinjector AOC-20is (Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan). The operational conditions for essential oils analysis (thyme and mint) were as follows: temperature program from 0 °C to 50 °C (2 min), from 50 °C to 215 °C (2 min) at 2 °C/min, and then from 215 °C increased to 310 °C (6 min) at 40 °C/min, pressure 69.6 kPa, total flow 65.2 mL/min, column flow 1.22 mL/min, and linear velocity 40 cm/sec. A column RXI-5MS (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d. × 0.25 μm film thickness) was used. Split injector temperature: 240 °C. Split ratio: 1:50. The operational conditions for tablets analysis were as follows: temperature program from 0 °C to 70 °C (2 min), from 70 °C to 250 °C (2 min) at 20 °C/min, then from 250 °C increased to 300 °C (3 min) at 50 °C/min, pressure 76.4 kPa, total flow 16.1 mL/min, column flow 1.19 mL/min, and linear velocity 40 cm/sec. Split injector temperature: 290 °C. Split ratio: 1:10. </p>
