<p>The following cell lines were used: pig kidney cells (PK-15 ATCC No. CCL-33) and monkey kidney cells (MARC-145 ATCC No. CRL-12231; Vero ATCC No. CCL-81). All cell lines were cultured in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM; Gibco) with additional 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco), 100 U mL
 <sup>−1</sup> penicillin and 100 μg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> streptomycin. Cells were grown at 37 °C in humidified 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> and 95% air mixture. Monolayers of cells were trypsinized, diluted (1:6 dilutions for PK-15 cells and 1:4 for MARC-145 and Vero cell lines, respectively) in growth medium and transferred to 25 cm
 <sup>2</sup> tissue culture flasks (TPP Techno Plastic Products AG, Trasadingen, Switzerland). The extract of oregano and the mint essential oil and thyme essential oil were evaluated on pig kidney cells (PK-15) and monkey kidney cells (MARC-145, Vero) in order to examine their cytotoxic effects against normal cells. The cells were seeded on 96-well plates (1× 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well) and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. After 48 h incubation, the cells were treated with the extracts (from 1 μL/mL to 50 μL/mL) for 24 h and 48 h at 37 °C. The essential oil extracts were dissolved in MEM. Following the removal of the extracts from the wells, the cells were washed in phosphate buffered saline. Cell viability was determined by MTT assay. The cytotoxicity of essential oil extracts was estimated against PK-15, Marc-145 and Vero cells using MTT assay [
 <xref rid="B46-animals-10-01734" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Each extract was tested in triplicate. After 72 h MTT reagent (10 μL, 5 mg/mL, Sigma-Aldrich) was added and incubated for 4 h at 37  °C. Then, 100 μL dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) (Carl Roth, Germany) was added into each well, and the plates were placed on the shaker for 5 min. The absorbance of each well was measured at 620 nm in a microplate reader (Multiskan™ FC Microplate Photometer, Thermo Fisher Scientific Oy, Ratastie, Finland), and the percentage of cell survival was calculated. Viability was defined as the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of absorbance of treated cells to that of untreated control cells.
