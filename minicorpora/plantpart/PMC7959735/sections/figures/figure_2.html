 <caption> Linkage disequilibrium decay at increasing genetic distances in the EUCLEG collection, the NJAU-Cultivated collection and in the NJAU-Wild collection. X-axis and Y-axis show the average distance between two SNPs in kbp and mean linkage disequilibrium ( r 2) within bins of 5 kbp distance, respectively. </caption>
