 <caption> (A) Graphical representation of the fastSTRUCTURE results for EUCLEG and NJAU combined sample sets at optimum K = 4. “NJAU-C” and “NJAU-W” represent the NJAU-Cultivated and NJAU-Wild parts of the NJAU collection. (B). Graphical representation of the fastSTRUCTURE results for the EUCLEG collection at optimum K = 5. “G1” to “G5” are the five subgroups identified by fastSTRUCTURE. “Admixed” are the accessions that could not be assigned unequivocally to one of the subgroups (see main text for further details). (C). Graphical representation of the first two dimensions of a principal components analysis for the EUCLEG collection. PC1 and PC2 explained 39 and 20% of total genetic variation in the EUCLEG collection.
