  <p>Comparison of the genetic diversity (π) between EUCLEG (blue), NJAU-Cultivated (red) and NJAU-Wild (orange). The lines represent the average π value of the 1 Mbp windows considered in the XP-CLR analysis. X-axis and Y-axis are represent the genomic position in million base pairs (Mbp) and π value for each chromosome, respectively. The shaded areas represent the selective sweep regions revealed by XP-CLR analysis. The start and end positions of 1 Mbp window with a step size of 5 kbp were defined externally from bedtools (v2.29.2) because XP-CLR does not provide that information in the output. XP-CLR considers recombination frequency instead of actual physical positions to define a window. This is the reason why some shaded areas are shifted a little at both sides of the actual window from XP-CLR (i.e., chromosome 19 and 20) in the representation.</p>
