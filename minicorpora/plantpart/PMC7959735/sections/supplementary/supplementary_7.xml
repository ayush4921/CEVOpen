  <p>Distribution of SNP categories. PHR, PolyHighResolution; MHR, MonoHighResolution; NMH, NoMinorHomozygote; OTH, Other; OTV, Off-TargetVariants; CRT; CallRateBelowThreshold. EUCLEG, NJAU and Combined represents EUCLEG separate analysis, NJAU separate analysis according to 
   <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. (2016)</xref>, and EUCLEG and NJAU combined analysis, respectively. PHR, MHR, and NMH are considered recommended categories; OTH, OTV and CRT are considered non-recommended categories. The SNP categories refer to the classification made according to the Axiom
   <sup>TM</sup> Analysis Suite 3.1 user guide (
