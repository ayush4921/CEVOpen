 <caption> Distribution of SNP categories. PHR, PolyHighResolution; MHR, MonoHighResolution; NMH, NoMinorHomozygote; OTH, Other; OTV, Off-TargetVariants; CRT; CallRateBelowThreshold. EUCLEG, NJAU and Combined represents EUCLEG separate analysis, NJAU separate analysis according to Wang et al. (2016), and EUCLEG and NJAU combined analysis, respectively. PHR, MHR, and NMH are considered recommended categories; OTH, OTV and CRT are considered non-recommended categories. The SNP categories refer to the classification made according to the Axiom TM Analysis Suite 3.1 user guide ( www.thermofisher.com/). Y-axis shows the frequency of SNPs (total 335,595). </caption>
