<p>The present study focused on the exploration of a representative sample of soybean accessions relevant for breeding in Europe, the EUCLEG collection. This is one of the first studies in which the patterns of genetic diversity in a large soybean germplasm set relevant for breeding in Europe has been compared to the genetic diversity contained in Chinese cultivated and wild soybean germplasm. Our study has demonstrated a relatively lower genetic diversity in the EUCLEG collection compared to Chinese collections of cultivated and wild accessions, which indicates a narrow genetic base of the EUCLEG collection. However, a more detailed analysis of the patterns of genetic diversity in the EUCLEG collection has revealed substantial sub-structuration in five subgroups associated with geographical origins, and without a clear association with maturity classes. A selective sweep analysis has revealed the presence of multiple signatures of selection in the EUCLEG collection, compared to Chinese wild germplasm. In particular, genomic regions previously reported to influence grain protein, yield and disease resistance have been identified, whose exploration in future work might facilitate further selection efforts. No signals of selection have been detected for loci involved in stem determinacy, probably because no directed selection has been performed for this trait among the germplasm represented in the EUCLEG collection. On the other hand, clear signatures of selection were detected for at least two loci involved in photoperiod sensitivity and time to flowering, which are main traits considered by breeders in order to adapt soybean for cultivation in Europe (only maturity classes 000 to I/II). Taken together, our results have identified relevant genomic regions that can be further exploited to improve soybean for the European agricultural sector, either through further improvement of genetic resources that are available in Europe, or through incorporation of exotic soybean material in European breeding programs.</p>
