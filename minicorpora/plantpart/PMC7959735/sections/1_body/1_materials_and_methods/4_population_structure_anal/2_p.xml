<p>Population structure was also inferred for the 477 genotyped accessions of the EUCLEG collection separately, using the settings and methods described in the previous paragraph. The analysis included 139,986 SNPs with MAF of at least 5% across the sample set. The number of subgroups (K) was determined considering the delta log-likelihood criterion. For the interpretation of the results of fastSTRUCTURE, once an optimal value of K was identified, each accession was assigned to a subgroup “n” for which the ancestral coefficient reached a value Qn ≥ 0.4; where n is the number of subgroup (1 to K). Accessions for which the two highest Q values differed by less than 0.2 were considered “Admixed”. Finally, the degree of divergence between the EUCLEG and the NJAU collections was estimated by calculating a fixation index (F
