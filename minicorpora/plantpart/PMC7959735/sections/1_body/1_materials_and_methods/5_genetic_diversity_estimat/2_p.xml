<p>Diversity estimates were determined for EUCLEG, NJAU-Cultivated, and NJAU-Wild separately, including all 224,993 SNPs. The EUCLEG collection contained 21 accessions from Chinese origin, but to avoid any possible confounding effect of those accessions while comparing genetic diversity between EUCLEG and NJAU, these 21 accessions were not considered. The average pairwise divergence among genotypes within each collection was then determined by computing the nucleotide diversity index (Ï€) per SNP site in VCFtools v. 0.1.15.</p>
