<p>For some of the downstream analyses, the genomic coordinates of the SNPs were required. Because during the development of the 355K SoySNP microarray SNP coordinates were assigned using an older version of the soybean reference genome sequence (Glyma.Wm82.a1), we positioned SNPs onto the novel reference genome sequence Glyma.Wm82.a2 (with improved assembly and gene annotation quality compared to Glyma.Wm82.a1). Finally, the 224,993 SNPs corresponding to probes that could be positioned onto the 20 soybean chromosomes using a blast query were considered for further analyses.</p>
