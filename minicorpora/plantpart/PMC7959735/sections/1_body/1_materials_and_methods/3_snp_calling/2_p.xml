<p>In a second step, we genotyped the combined dataset (EUCLEG and NJAU), starting from the raw fluorescence data following the procedure described above. In the quality control step, 69 poor quality samples were excluded. SNP calling was performed on the remaining 805 good quality samples. After genotyping, low quality SNPs based on SNP QC metrics were excluded and a final genotyping dataset containing 229,557 SNPs was generated. This dataset was divided in three subsets for further processing: EUCLEG, NJAU-Wild and NJAU-Cultivated, comprising 477, 82, and 246 accessions, respectively. For the divisions NJAU-Wild and NJAU-Cultivated, we refer to 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. (2016)</xref>. In further analyses, we considered either the whole collection (EUCLEG and NJAU) or some of these subsets.
