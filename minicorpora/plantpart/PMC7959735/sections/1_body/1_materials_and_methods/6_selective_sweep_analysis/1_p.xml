<p>To detect signals of selection in the EUCLEG collection, the cross-population composite likelihood ratio test (XP-CLR) implemented in XP-CLR v. 1.0 (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2010</xref>) was used. XP-CLR is a site frequency spectrum (SFS)-based method that detects selective sweeps by jointly modeling the multi-locus allele frequency differentiation between two populations. Given the allele frequency of a locus in the reference population, XP-CLR maximizes the likelihood ratio of the allele frequency in an object population between a selective sweep model and a null model (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2010</xref>). We compared the object EUCLEG collection to the reference NJAU-Wild collection. The 21 accessions of Chinese origin in the EUCLEG collection were not considered in this analysis. XP-CLR requires as input the genetic position (expressed in recombination units) of each SNP. Because for most SNPs the genetic position was unknown, we transformed physical positions (Mbp) to recombination positions (cM) considering a homogeneous recombination rate (1 Mbp = 1 cM) throughout the soybean genome.
