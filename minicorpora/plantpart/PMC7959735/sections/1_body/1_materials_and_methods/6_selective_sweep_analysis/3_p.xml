 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Grant et al., 2010</xref>) was used to search for reported QTLs located in the selective sweep regions and to generate a list of genes positioned in respective selective sweep regions. The transcripts description was obtained from “Gmax_275_Wm82.a2.v1.annotation_info.txt”

  <xref ref-type="fn" rid="footnote5">5</xref>

 </sup>. The former contains transcript definition of the best hit obtained through homology-dependent sequence analysis of soybean transcripts in the Arabidopsis genome, whereas the latter corresponds to their molecular and biological functions manually annotated and reviewed from literature and computational analysis by the UniProtKB.
