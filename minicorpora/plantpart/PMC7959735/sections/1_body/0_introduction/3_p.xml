<p>Modern cultivated soybean was domesticated approximately 5000 years ago from its wild progenitor Glycine soja, which is distributed throughout Eastern Asia, including most of China, South Korea, and Japan (

 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Pagano and Miransari, 2016</xref>). Being a restorative crop, soybean fixes atmospheric nitrogen in symbiosis with Rhizobium bacteria and delivers environmental services by minimizing the need for mineral nitrogen fertilizer. Between 2008 and 2018, global soybean production has grown from 212 to 337 million tons per year, while the total cultivated surface increased from 97 to 124 million hectares (

 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">IDH and IUCN NL, 2019</xref>)). To meet the increasing European demand and to reduce the dependency on import, it is crucial to expand soybean cultivation and to adapt soybean genotypes to new cultivation zones in Europe. This requires a good understanding of the origin and genetic architecture of European soybean germplasm and how it relates to the germplasm from other origins.
