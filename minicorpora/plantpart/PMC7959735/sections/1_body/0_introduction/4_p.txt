0: Based on the responsiveness of soybean flowering and maturity to photoperiod and temperature, a total of 13 distinct maturity groups have been defined, of which only early maturing types (maturity groups MG000 to MGII) are suitable for cultivation in Europe ( Kurasch et al., 2017).
1: Previous studies have shown a narrow genetic base of the European soybean germplasm ( Hahn and Wurschum, 2014;  Zulj Mihaljevic et al., 2020), which can be due to the use of only a few ancestors originating from Canada, North America, Japan and China for breeding in Europe ( Ristova et al., 2010;  Hahn and Wurschum, 2014;  Miladinovic et al., 2018).
2: In addition, the original material used for breeding probably carried a low level of genetic diversity, as both pedigree and molecular marker data have indicated a narrow genetic base of North American and Canadian germplasm ( Gizlice et al., 1996;  Vaughn and Li, 2016;  Bruce et al., 2019).
3: In contrast, the Chinese soybean breeding pool contains a high level of genetic diversity because of a long history of cultivation over diverse eco-geographical zones with varying ranges of temperature and photoperiod ( Liu et al., 2017).
4: Selective sweep analysis has also been applied in soybean to understand the domestication and selection history.
5: For example,  Wen et al.
6: (2015);  Zhou et al.
7: (2015) and  Wang et al.
8: (2016) report candidate selection regions harboring genes potentially involved in traits of agronomic relevance such as grain yield, seed size, flowering date, maturity date, seed protein and oil content and traits related to stress tolerance.
9: In addition, selective sweep analysis by  Jeong et al.
10: (2019) reported domestication-related signals in soybean using mainly germplasm from Japan and Korea.
11: Thus, available studies have considered materials of Chinese, Japanese and Korean origin.
12: However, similar studies have not been performed in the soybean genepool available in Europe.
