0: Here, we present an analysis of the genetic diversity within the EUCLEG collection and identify selective sweeps through a genome-wide diversity scan between the EUCLEG and a Chinese soybean collection ( Wang et al., 2016) (NJAU collection).
1: Specific objectives of this study were: (i) to explore the structure and genetic relatedness of accessions in the EUCLEG collection; (ii) to determine the level of genetic diversity in the EUCLEG collection compared to that of the NJAU collection; (ii) to identify genomic regions that putatively underwent selective sweeps in the EUCLEG collection and their significance for future soybean improvement efforts in Europe.
