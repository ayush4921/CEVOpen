<p>Based on the responsiveness of soybean flowering and maturity to photoperiod and temperature, a total of 13 distinct maturity groups have been defined, of which only early maturing types (maturity groups MG000 to MGII) are suitable for cultivation in Europe (

 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Žulj Mihaljević et al., 2020</xref>), which can be due to the use of only a few ancestors originating from Canada, North America, Japan and China for breeding in Europe (

 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Hahn and Würschum, 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Miladinović et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, the original material used for breeding probably carried a low level of genetic diversity, as both pedigree and molecular marker data have indicated a narrow genetic base of North American and Canadian germplasm (

 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Vaughn and Li, 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Bruce et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, the Chinese soybean breeding pool contains a high level of genetic diversity because of a long history of cultivation over diverse eco-geographical zones with varying ranges of temperature and photoperiod (

 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Wen et al. (2015)</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al. (2015)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. (2016)</xref> report candidate selection regions harboring genes potentially involved in traits of agronomic relevance such as grain yield, seed size, flowering date, maturity date, seed protein and oil content and traits related to stress tolerance. In addition, selective sweep analysis by 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Jeong et al. (2019)</xref> reported domestication-related signals in soybean using mainly germplasm from Japan and Korea. Thus, available studies have considered materials of Chinese, Japanese and Korean origin. However, similar studies have not been performed in the soybean genepool available in Europe.
