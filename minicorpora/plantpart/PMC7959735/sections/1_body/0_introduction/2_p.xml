<p>Selective sweeps have been analyzed in several crops to reconstruct their history of domestication and selection and to identify the genetic loci and their underlying genome sequence that were mainly affected by these processes. For example, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Hufford et al. (2012)</xref> identified 3,040 genes through selective sweep analysis, revealing signatures of domestication and improvement of maize in the United States. The dispersion history and adaptive evolution of wheat throughout the agro-ecological zones of China have been inferred by population genetics analysis including selective sweep analysis (

 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Ndjiondjop et al. (2019)</xref> identified 37 candidate selective sweep regions harboring genes related to biotic and abiotic stress tolerance in African rice, and demonstrated that those regions displayed low genetic diversity as a result of strong positive selection and domestication in African rice compared to Asian rice and its wild progenitor (Oryza barthii A. Chev.). A selective sweep analysis in barley by 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Pankin et al. (2018)</xref> provided molecular evidence of multiple domestication origins and allowed to distinguish domestication-related traits (i.e., non-brittle rachis) from improvement-related traits (i.e., naked grain).
