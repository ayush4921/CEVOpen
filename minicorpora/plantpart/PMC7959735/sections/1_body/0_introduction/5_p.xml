<p>Our current knowledge on the origin and genetic relationships within European soybean germplasm is still fragmented. Main reasons are the limited number of accessions (covering only a fraction of the total genetic diversity) that were included in previous studies (e.g., 28 accessions in 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Ristova et al. (2010)</xref>, 93 in 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Hahn and Würschum (2014)</xref>, 75 in 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Kurasch et al. (2017)</xref> and 97 in 
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Žulj Mihaljević et al. (2020)</xref>), and/or the low number of genetic markers that were used for screening. 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Miladinović et al. (2018)</xref>, genotyped 445 accessions at 85,000 SNP loci, but only used the 38 SNPs located in maturity genes for analysis, and focused on materials from one European breeding program. To fill this gap in our knowledge about the genetics of soybean germplasm relevant for breeding in Europe and to develop breeding tools for legume crops including soybean, a consortium was established within the European Union project EUCLEG

 </sup>. In this context a unique collection of 480 soybean accessions considered relevant for European breeders, originating from 25 countries and covering a broad range of genetic diversity was assembled (named the EUCLEG collection in what follows). This offers a unique opportunity to compare the genetic diversity of the EUCLEG collection to that contained in reference materials from China, helping us to understand the main forces that have shaped the soybean genepool currently being used in breeding programs outside China.
