0: Crop improvement relies on genetic diversity of plant genetic resources.
1: A high genetic diversity provides an opportunity for plant breeders to develop cultivars with desirable characteristics ( Savchenko, 2017;  Byrne et al., 2018).
2: Todays improved cultivars of various crops, with specific characteristics depending on their use and environmental adaptation, are the result of historical domestication events and intentional as well as unintentional selections by farmers and breeders ( Bradshaw, 2017;  Stoskopf et al., 2019).
3: The processes of domestication and selection lead to an increased frequency of favorable alleles, and in the most extreme situation may cause complete fixation at genomic loci underlying beneficial traits in the genepool of the crop ( Smykal et al., 2018;  Weigand and Leese, 2018).
4: At chromosomal scale, the locus that underlies a beneficial trait is surrounded by other linked loci carrying neutral mutations.
5: The selection process targeting the advantageous allele also results in an increase of the frequency of alleles at those neutral loci that are in linkage disequilibrium with the advantageous allele.
6: This causes a so-called selective sweep in the genome.
7: Genomic regions that have undergone a selective sweep are characterized by high levels of homozygosity, an increase in low- and high-frequency alleles, a high linkage disequilibrium and a low genetic diversity ( Nielsen, 2005;  Hufford et al., 2012).
