0: Modern cultivated soybean was domesticated approximately 5000 years ago from its wild progenitor Glycine soja, which is distributed throughout Eastern Asia, including most of China, South Korea, and Japan ( Jeong et al., 2019).
1: Soybean is the worlds most grown high-value legume crop with beans containing high percentages of protein and oil ( Pagano and Miransari, 2016).
2: Being a restorative crop, soybean fixes atmospheric nitrogen in symbiosis with Rhizobium bacteria and delivers environmental services by minimizing the need for mineral nitrogen fertilizer.
3: Between 2008 and 2018, global soybean production has grown from 212 to 337 million tons per year, while the total cultivated surface increased from 97 to 124 million hectares ( IDH and IUCN NL, 2019).
4: Soybean was first introduced to Europe during the second half of the 19th century.
5: The current soybean acreage of 5.5 million hectares in Europe, representing a mere 3.4% of the world soybean production ( FAOSTAT., 2019), can meet only 34% of the current European need for soybean ( IDH and IUCN NL, 2019)).
6: To meet the increasing European demand and to reduce the dependency on import, it is crucial to expand soybean cultivation and to adapt soybean genotypes to new cultivation zones in Europe.
7: This requires a good understanding of the origin and genetic architecture of European soybean germplasm and how it relates to the germplasm from other origins.
