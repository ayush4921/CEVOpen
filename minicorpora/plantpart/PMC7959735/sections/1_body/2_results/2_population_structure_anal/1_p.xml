<p>We analyzed the presence of population structure using two approaches, fastSTRUCTURE and PCA. In the EUCLEG and NJAU combined analysis comprising 805 accessions, the marginal likelihood of the fastSTRUCTURE-output from K = 2 to K = 10 indicated the optimum K between 2 and 4 (

 </sub> values were 0.14, 0.34 and 0.22 for EUCLEG vs. NJAU-Cultivated, EUCLEG vs. NJAU-Wild and NJAU-Cultivated vs. NJAU-Wild comparisons, respectively. This indicates that the set of 805 soybean accessions considered in this study consists of three major groups including EUCLEG, NJAU-Cultivated and NJAU-Wild. The relatively low F
 <sub>ST</sub> between EUCLEG and NJAU-Cultivated in relation to comparisons with NJAU-Wild supports a strong differentiation between cultivated and wild soybean accessions.
