<p>The results of the cluster analysis were similar with those of the fastSTRUCTURE analysis of EUCLEG and NJAU combined (see above). The accessions of the two collections were assigned to different clusters. NJAU-cultivated and NJAU-wild grouped into two separate clusters as in 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. (2016)</xref>. Interestingly, the accessions of Chinese origin included in the EUCLEG collection clustered mostly among the EUCLEG germplasm, spread over several clusters and only one of them clustered within NJAU-Cultivated (
