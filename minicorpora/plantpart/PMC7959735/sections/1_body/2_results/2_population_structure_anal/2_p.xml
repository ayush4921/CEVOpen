<p>In the separate analysis of the EUCLEG collection the marginal likelihood of the fastSTRUCTURE-output from K = 2 to K = 10 indicated the optimum at K = 5 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS5">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). Although some small subgroups were formed at K &gt; 5, we worked further with five subgroups as this clustering was in concordance with the background information of the accessions. Population structure in the EUCLEG collection is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1B,C</xref> and is summarized in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Additional information about the type and maturity group of accessions within each subgroup can be found in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>. Of the total of 477 accessions, 362 were assigned to one of five subgroups (G1 to G5), and the remaining 115 accessions displayed substantial admixture and could not be assigned unequivocally to a specific subgroup. Some association was found between subgroup and origin namely the regions of Southern Europe, Eastern Europe, Western Europe and Northern Europe, while no clear association between subgroup and maturity group (MG) was found. Subgroup G1 contains 93 accessions, 66 of which originate from Southern Europe. They are medium late (MG 0) and late maturing (MG I/II) varieties and breeding lines from Institute of Field and Vegetable Crops, Serbia (IFVCNS), Maize Research Institute Zemun Polje, Serbia (MRIZP) and Agenzia regionale per lo Sviluppo Rurale del Friuli Venezia Giulia, Italy (ERSA FVG), and they group closely with a set of accessions from United States and Canada. Subgroup G2 contains 59 accessions, 26 of which (of all four MGs) originate from Eastern Europe; these accessions group closely with accessions from China. A total 21 of G2 accessions originate from Germany and the Czech Republic and the remaining accessions are from Bulgaria, Poland, Russia, Ukraine and China. The largest subgroup is G3 with 127 accessions, 72 of which originate from Western Europe. In G3, 57 accessions including very early (MG 000) to early maturing (MG 00) breeding lines are from Flanders Research Institute for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Belgium (ILVO) and Storm Seeds, Belgium. A set of 16 early maturing varieties from Canada is also part of G3. Finally, G4 and G5 contain 44 and 39 accessions, respectively. G4 contains a unique group of edamame-types from Storm Seeds (Belgium) and from Japan. Subgroup G5 contains accessions from Eastern, Western and Northern Europe; they are mainly MG 000 accessions.
