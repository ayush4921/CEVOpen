<p>Average pairwise divergence among genotypes per site (π) decreased from 0.31 in NJAU-Wild to 0.26 in NJAU-Cultivated and to 0.23 in EUCLEG (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). This is in agreement with a loss of genetic diversity due to domestication and selection in cultivated soybean. There is also a clear tendency toward less variation in average π values per chromosome in NJAU-Wild compared to NJAU-Cultivated and to EUCLEG (coefficient of variation of average π values per chromosome is 4.6, 10.4, and 13.1%, respectively). This is consistent with a scenario of a genetic bottleneck and selection that might have more prominently affected specific chromosomes in the cultivated genepools suggesting that selective sweep analysis comparing EUCLEG and NJAU-Wild may help to identify chromosomal regions that have undergone selection and domestication in the past and that probably are involved in the determination of important agronomic traits.
