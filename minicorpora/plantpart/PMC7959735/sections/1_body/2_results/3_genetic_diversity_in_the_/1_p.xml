<p>A higher number of fixed SNP sites (MAF = 0) was observed in the EUCLEG collection (20%) compared to the NJAU collections (13% and 10% in NJAU-Cultivated and NJAU-Wild, respectively) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS7">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>). Moreover, the proportion of polymorphic SNPs (MAF â‰¥ 5%) was lower in EUCLEG (62%) than in NJAU-Cultivated (72%) and NJAU-Wild (82%). These results suggest an overall higher level of homozygosity in the EUCLEG collection compared to the NJAU collections.
