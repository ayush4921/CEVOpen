<p>Linkage disequilibrium (LD) dropped to half of its maximum at 175, 100, and 50 kbp in EUCLEG, NJAU-Cultivated and NJAU-Wild, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), suggesting lower effective population size in the EUCLEG and NJAU-Cultivated collections than in the NJAU-Wild collection. In addition, the three collections showed different patterns of LD per chromosome (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), which indicates different histories of recombination and selection in these three collections.
