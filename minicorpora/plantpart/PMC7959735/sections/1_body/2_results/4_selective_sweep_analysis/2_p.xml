<p>A nearly equal and relatively low nucleotide diversity (Ï€) was observed in selective sweep regions 6.2, 12.2, and 15.1 in both EUCLEG (0.14, 0.06, and 0.23) and NJAU-Cultivated (0.13, 0.06, and 0.21) when compared to NJAU-Wild (0.39, 0.35, and 0.34) (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS9">Supplementary Figure 9</xref>). This indicates that the traits regulated by these regions may have undergone similar histories of selection in EUCLEG and NJAU-Cultivated. Known QTLs for water use efficiency (WUE) and time to flowering and maturity coincide with region 6.2 and 15.1 (
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). In addition, genes conferring resistance to pathogens or controlling time to flowering are located in these regions (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Strikingly, no QTL coincided with selective sweep region 12.1, although this region harbors genes for important functions such as control of time to flowering (
