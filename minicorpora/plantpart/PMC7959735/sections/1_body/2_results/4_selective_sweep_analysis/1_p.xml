<p>XP-CLR analysis revealed 23 selective sweep regions with an average length of 1.8 Mbp (range 1.14 Mbpâ€“3.75 Mbp) (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), accounting for 4% of the total sequenced genome length. Selective sweep regions were present on 12 different chromosomes including 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 19, and 20 and some chromosomes had multiple selective sweep regions (

 </sup> delivered 248 of the total 2,880 previously published QTLs coinciding with the selective sweep regions (
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). A total of 3,811 genes were positioned within the selective sweep regions. The description of genes is provided in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>. Consistent with the selected proportion of total chromosome size, selective sweep regions on chromosome 7 and 19 contained the highest (1,104) and the lowest (44) number of genes, respectively (
