<p>Interestingly, π was extremely low (0.04 − 0.13) in selective sweep regions 1.1, 1.2, 7.4, 7.5, 8.2, 18.2 and 19.1 in EUCLEG as compared to NJAU-Cultivated (0.16 − 0.33) and NJAU-Wild (0.25 − 0.35), indicating a greater strength of selection on these regions in EUCLEG (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS9">Supplementary Figure 9</xref>). Such a low diversity in EUCLEG can be caused by the effects of domestication and/or selection. These regions contain known QTLs for seed fatty acids, seed oil, yield components, resistance to biotic stresses including Sclerotinia stem rot (SCL), time to flowering, and WUE (
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Genes controlling flowering and maturity, resistance against pathogens, uptake of minerals, and abiotic stress response are also located in these selective sweep regions (
