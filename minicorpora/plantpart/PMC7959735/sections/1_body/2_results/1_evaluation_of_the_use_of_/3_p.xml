<p>For 224,993 SNPs of the total 229,557 (98%), new coordinates could be positioned onto 20 chromosomes in the Glyma.Wm82.a2 soybean reference genome sequence using a BLAST query. The probes targeting the remaining SNPs (4,564) were either missing in the novel soybean genome assembly or were assigned to the non-anchored scaffolds and not to chromosomes, and were excluded from subsequent analyses. The genome-wide distribution of the final set of 224,993 SNPs used for downstream data analyses is given in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The longest chromosome (18) contained the highest number of SNPs (6.3% of the total 224,993), and the shortest chromosome (11) contained the lowest number of SNPs (3.8% of the total 224,993). The average SNP density was the lowest on chromosome 1 and the highest on chromosome 13 (19 and 27 SNPs per 100 kbp, respectively). The average distance between two adjacent SNPs was 2.6 kbp (
