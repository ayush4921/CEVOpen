<p>Analysis of the EUCLEG collection with the 355K SoySNP array revealed a total of 285,953 SNP markers (80% of the total 355,595 SNPs present on the array) belonging to the recommended categories including PolyHighResolution (PHR, total 211,593), MonoHighResolution (MHR, total 46,953) and NoMinorHom (NMH, total 27,407). These categories refer to SNPs exhibiting all three genotypic classes with a good cluster resolution (PHR), SNPs with good cluster resolution but displaying only one of the homozygous clusters (MHR) and SNPs with good cluster resolution but for which one of the two homozygous clusters is missing (NMH). These proportions correspond quite well with those previously reported for the NJAU collection by 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. (2016)</xref> (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>), indicating that the 355K SoySNP array is not only useful for the genotyping of Chinese soybean germplasm, but also for germplasm from other origins.
