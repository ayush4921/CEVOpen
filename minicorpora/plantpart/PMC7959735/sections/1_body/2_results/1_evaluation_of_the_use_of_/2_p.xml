<p>Genotyping of the EUCLEG and NJAU combined collection rendered 229,557 SNPs (65% of the total 355,595) belonging to the recommended categories (PHR, MHR and NMH; a total of 194,171, 16,868 and 18,518 respectively). For the remaining 126,038 SNPs, at least one of the QC metrics were below the threshold and hence they were assigned to non-recommended categories. There were 16% (of the total 355,595) more SNPs of non-recommended categories in the combined analysis as compared to the separate analysis of the EUCLEG collection. This was because a number of SNPs (19% of the total 355,595) of recommended categories (PHR, MHR and NMH) in the EUCLEG separate analysis were assigned to the non-recommended categories in the combined analysis. Taken together, these results indicate that SNP calling on EUCLEG and NJAU combined is essential to get a more precise classification of SNP markers as compared to a separate analysis for each collection. In addition, these results indicate that the SNP dataset of EUCLEG and NJAU combined contains a high number of SNPs from the recommended categories.</p>
