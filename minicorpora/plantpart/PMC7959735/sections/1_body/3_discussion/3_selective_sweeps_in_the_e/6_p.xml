<p>Our analysis has also revealed some signatures of selection related to seed fatty acids including the polyunsaturated fatty acids (linolenic acid and linoleic acid) and monounsaturated fatty acids (oleic acid). Improving the quality of seed oil by minimizing the level of polyunsaturated fatty acids is an important consideration for improved stability of soybean oil (
