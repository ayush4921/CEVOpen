<p>In Europe, soybean is considered a protein crop and, together with yield, seed protein content is one of the main breeding goals (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Berschneider, 2016</xref>). We have identified several signatures of selection that coincide with QTLs for these traits. In addition, selective sweep regions also contain some QTLs related to nutrient use efficiency (e.g., P, Fe, K, and Ca) indicating that they might have been selected for nutrient use efficiency. However, from the total 230 QTLs for seed protein that are described in SoyBase, only 31 were located in the selective sweep regions detected in this study. This, together with the observation that the protein content is higher in wild accessions than in cultivated accessions (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Chen and Nelson, 2004</xref>) indicates that during the domestication and improvement processes, either some favorable haplotypes for high protein content might have been lost or that the diversity present at those sites might not have been exploited yet in the EUCLEG collection. Therefore, there is still room to improve seed protein content by exploiting the genetic diversity available in the EUCLEG collection for this trait.
