<p>To the best of our knowledge this is one of the first studies that explores the genetic diversity of a large soybean collection relevant for breeding in Europe, in comparison to Chinese germplasm. Although we have found several selective sweeps that could be linked to useful traits in soybean through XP-CLR analysis, some methodological aspects require attention. First, genotyping using whole genome sequencing rather than microarray data could provide more variants and thus a more detailed description of the genomic regions that have experienced selective sweeps (

Second, some of the selective sweeps determined by XP-CLR might be false positives caused by demographic processes such as bottlenecks or population expansions (
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Weigand and Leese, 2018</xref>). While the first aspect can be tackled if sufficient resources are available, d it is hard to entirely overcome the second limitation unless other methods are developed that allow to differentiate among the different scenarios that can lead to a positive signal of selection.
