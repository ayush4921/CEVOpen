<p>Resistance to diseases, especially to Sclerotinia stem rot (SCL) caused by 
 <italic>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</italic>, is considered important in European soybean breeding programs because SCL is widely spread throughout Europe (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">RÃ¼delsheim and Smets, 2012</xref>). 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Pannecoucque et al. (2018)</xref> reported the presence of genetic variation in the level of susceptibility for SCL in 14 early maturing varieties from Europe. Sources of SCL resistance have been identified on 11 soybean chromosomes and a total of 99 QTLs have been reported in SoyBase (reviewed in 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Neupane et al., 2019</xref>). In our analysis, only 9 QTLs coincided with a selective sweep region. Moreover, soybean mosaic virus (SMV) can be a serious issue in Western and Northern Europe (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Aper et al., 2016</xref>). Of the 18 QTLs conferring resistance to different strains of SMV reported in SoyBase, only a single QTL coincided with a selective sweep region in the EUCLEG collection. Lack of selection signals for a large number of previously reported QTLs linked to resistance to SCL and SMV suggests a high genetic diversity at the corresponding genomic loci in the EUCLEG collection. A more detailed analysis of the genetic patterns at these QTLs in the EUCLEG collection might be relevant to plan future breeding efforts to improve SCL and SMV resistance in European germplasm.
