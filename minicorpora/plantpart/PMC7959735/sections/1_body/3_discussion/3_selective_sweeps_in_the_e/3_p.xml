<p>Surprisingly, no significant signatures of selection were detected for stem determinacy, which is an important adaptive trait affecting grain yield in soybean (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Kato et al., 2019</xref>). Determinate growth habit is a domestication related trait (reviewed in 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Sedivy et al., 2017</xref>), as a high level of determinacy contributes to synchronous seed maturation, thus avoiding undesired variability of moisture content in the harvested material. However, determinate varieties perform less well at high latitudes (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Kato et al., 2019</xref>) including a large part of Northern and Western Europe (
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Schori et al., 2003</xref>). We have previously shown that stem determinacy is quite variable in the EUCLEG collection (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Borra-Serrano et al., 2020</xref>), which may explain why the selective sweep analysis presented here failed to obtain relevant signatures of selection for this trait.
