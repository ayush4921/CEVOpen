<p>We have found multiple QTLs for flowering and maturity coinciding with the selective sweep regions. Both are important phenological traits relevant for adaptation of soybean to different cultivation areas. These traits are regulated by the so-called E loci (
 <italic>E1</italic> to 
 <italic>E10</italic>) (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Samanfar et al., 2017</xref>). Except for 
 <italic>E6</italic> and 
 <italic>E9</italic>, dominant alleles at other E-loci are photoperiod sensitive and confer late maturity, and photoperiod sensitivity decreases as the number of recessive alleles increases (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Bonato and Vello, 1999</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Destro et al., 2001</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Kong et al., 2014</xref>). In this study we found two selective sweep regions in the neighborhood of loci 
 <italic>E2</italic> and 
 <italic>E4</italic> (region 10.2 and proximal to region 20.1, respectively), suggesting strong signals of selection at these loci in the EUCLEG collection. These results are consistent with previous reports. According to 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Kurasch et al. (2017)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Miladinović et al. (2018)</xref>, the European soybean accessions included in their studies contained different haplotypes of four E loci (
 <italic>E1</italic> to 
 <italic>E4</italic>) with the recessive 
 <italic>e1</italic> and 
 <italic>e2</italic> alleles being more frequently found in Central Europe and the dominant 
 <italic>E3</italic> and 
 <italic>E4</italic> alleles being more frequent in Southern European accessions. The genetic diversity of region 10.2 (π = 0.11) and 20.1 (π = 0.25) indicate that the 
 <italic>E2</italic> locus is more fixed than the 
 <italic>E4</italic> locus in the EUCLEG collection. Furthermore, the absence of any previously reported QTL coinciding with the selective sweep region 12.2 containing genes related to time to flowering and hormonal signaling (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) provides the opportunity to explore this region for new QTLs. In addition, further selection efforts to increase earliness in European germplasm can either focus on the selection of recessive alleles at the 
 <italic>E4</italic> locus or the exploitation of available genetic diversity present in other loci related to photoperiod sensitivity.
