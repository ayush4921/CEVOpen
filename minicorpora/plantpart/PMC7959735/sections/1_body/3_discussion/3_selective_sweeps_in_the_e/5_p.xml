<p>Previously known QTLs related to high seed oil content also coincided with the selective sweep regions in the EUCLEG collection compared to NJAU-Wild. This is in line with the observation that wild soybean seeds have low oil content (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Chen and Nelson, 2004</xref>). Although European soybean is not specifically bred for high oil content, soybean breeding programs in Europe have incorporated breeding materials from United States, where seed oil content is an important trait (
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Xavier et al., 2018</xref>). A low to medium genetic diversity of the respective selective sweep regions in the EUCLEG collection as compared to NJAU-Cultivated and NJAU-Wild suggests that these QTLs are not completely fixed in the EUCLEG collection.
