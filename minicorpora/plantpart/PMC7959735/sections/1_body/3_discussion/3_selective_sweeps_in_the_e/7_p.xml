<p>Soybean, a member of the Fabaceae family, has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiosis with rhizobium bacteria. It has been reported that high yielding soybean varieties have a better ability to fix nitrogen (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Collino et al., 2015</xref>). While direct selection of nitrogen fixation may not have been one of the objectives of current breeding programs, we have found that some previously known QTLs related to nitrogen fixation coincide with the selective sweep regions in the EUCLEG collection. This suggests that this trait might have been improved indirectly through selection for high yield. However, from the total of 145 QTLs for nitrogen fixation reported in SoyBase 11 coincide with selective sweep regions in our analysis. This suggests that still a broad genetic diversity might be present in the EUCLEG collection which can be further used to improve nitrogen fixation.
