<p>We have applied the XP-CLR methodology to determine selective sweeps because compared to other approaches, XP-CLR is robust to determine selective sweeps even in structured populations and has a higher power to detect signals of selection. Moreover it can be used with un-phased genotyping data (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Vatsiou et al., 2016</xref>). We have identified 23 selective sweep regions spread over 12 chromosomes, that together account for 4% of the total sequenced genome length. This is in accordance with 
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al. (2015)</xref> who similarly found 5% of the total sequenced genome length affected by selective sweeps when comparing cultivated soybean accessions from different origins to wild Chinese soybean accessions.
