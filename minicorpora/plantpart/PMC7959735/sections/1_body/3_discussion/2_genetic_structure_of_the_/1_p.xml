<p>Soybean is native to China, Japan and Korea, and has been introduced to Europe and other parts of the world (

 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, population structure analysis in our study revealed a clear genetic differentiation between the EUCLEG and both the NJAU-Wild, and NJAU-Cultivated collections. This reflects breeding efforts in different parts of the world over many decades that have concentrated on improving the local adaptation of soybean to different environmental conditions. Accessions of Chinese origin included in the EUCLEG collection clustered closely with other accessions from EUCLEG instead of clustering with NJAU accessions. This is probably because these accessions have been used for breeding purposes outside China and in this way show closer relationships with their descendants.
