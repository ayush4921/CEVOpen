<p>The level of genetic diversity (Ï€) in this study was the lowest for the EUCLEG collection, followed by NJAU-Cultivated, and with NJAU-Wild containing the highest level of genetic diversity. This agrees with the model for soybean breeding history presented by 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Hyten et al. (2006)</xref>, in which domestication and further selection has reduced the genetic diversity in Asian germplasm. This was followed by genetic bottlenecks during introduction of soybean to other regions of the world and further selection. As a consequence, the substantially lower level of diversity in the EUCLEG collection in comparison to the NJAU collections reflects the combined effect of all three processes (domestication, introduction bottlenecks and selection).
