<p>In soybean, different genotyping microarrays are available including the SoySNP50K iSelect Bead chip from Illumina (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Song et al., 2013</xref>) and the SoySNP180K Axiom microarray from Affymetrix (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2015</xref>) containing probes for 52,041 and 180,961 SNPs, respectively. Here we have used the recently developed NJAU 355K Affymetrix SoySNP array containing probes for 355,595 SNPs (
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). The proportion of high quality SNPs detected in this study for the EUCLEG collection corresponded quite well with that for the NJAU collection reported by 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. (2016)</xref>. This indicates that the 355K SoySNP microarray, which was originally developed using plant materials of Chinese origin, is also useful for genotyping soybean from non-Chinese origin. It was therefore possible to perform SNP calling on combined EUCLEG and NJAU collections. This joint analysis offered the advantage that genotyping a larger sample set minimizes the chance of misclassification of SNPs, which reduces the type I error (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Mascha and Vetter, 2018</xref>). This combined SNP dataset is therefore of great value to analyze the genetic diversity available in the EUCLEG collection and to contrast this with the genetic diversity present in the Chinese collection.
