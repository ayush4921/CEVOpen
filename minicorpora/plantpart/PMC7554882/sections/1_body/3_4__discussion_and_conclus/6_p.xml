<p>Bioassays should ideally provide a range of toxic concentrations according to the mechanism involved in the toxicity process. Standardized methodologies/protocols to define the toxicity level of individual compounds as well as their blends are needed at the macroscopic or remote level and on a specific scale to allow prediction. It is always a question of targeting an applied plant model and then defining the toxicity levels in those specific application conditions. In this regard, in vivo redox and osmotic status sensor should be used as a specific marker of toxicity levels.</p>
