<p>The last point relates to the composition of the EOs. High complexity of EOC needs to be characterized properly as hundreds of compounds sometimes occur [

 <xref rid="B118-foods-09-01291" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>], sometimes leading to fundamentally different compositions [
 <xref rid="B119-foods-09-01291" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. However, even if fundamental interaction cannot be studied properly for hundreds of compounds, their diverse mechanisms of action can constitute a strong opportunity for synergistic effects and prevent adaptation by weed species. Interaction between different EOC can allow a reduction in the application, while still effectively preventing germination and weed growth [
