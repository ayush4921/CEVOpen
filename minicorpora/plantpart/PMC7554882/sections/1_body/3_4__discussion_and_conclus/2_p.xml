<p>Regarding herbicidal application, cellular metabolism reactions are clearly involved in the phytotoxic properties of essential oils. The scientific community is making progress in identifying the cellular functions affected, such as photosynthesis, respiration, etc., and research is advancing in molecular target identification. Nevertheless, due to the many interconnecting pathways that are involved simultaneously, no clear distinction has appeared between the diverse chemical classes of EOs compounds. Most of them are grouped within one EO, which makes the unravelling of the specific mode of action a complex process. However, their effects can be distinguished between a general stress type response (ROS or osmotic related) compared to a more specific target (microtubule for example) leading to cellular impairment at a much lower concentration.</p>
