<p>An additional consideration concerns the kinetic release of EOs. Indeed, their persistence and application methods are limited due to their low molecular weight, hydrophobicity and high volatility. To overcome these limitations, much work has been done regarding formulation techniques to allow a control release profile. A recent promising domain is the formulation of nano-emulsion using bio-based surfactants [
