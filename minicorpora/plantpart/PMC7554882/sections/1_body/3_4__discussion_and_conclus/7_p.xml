<p>Other opportunities seem to arise at low concentrations far below the toxicity threshold, such as biostimulation [

 <xref rid="B91-foods-09-01291" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. This elicitation of the systemic defense mechanism can also result in broader abiotic pest protection and be a pertinent agronomical strategy. However, limitations arise in regard to the allocation of resources (growth-defense trade-off) and reduced efficiency compared to a synthetic product. The same essential oils/constituents are sometimes mentioned to be phytotoxic at high concentrations and beneficial at low ones following a dose response concept. It has been proposed that these low doses simulate mild stress [
 <xref rid="B122-foods-09-01291" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. However, such threshold models as hormesis are still debated in biology and very little is known about the underlying mechanisms [
