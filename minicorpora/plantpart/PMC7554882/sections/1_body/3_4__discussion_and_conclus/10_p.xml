<p>To conclude, the use of EOs for sustainable agricultural practices seems promising, and extensive research will probably clarify or deny their relevance in diverse applications. Due to their inherent characteristics, the pest control properties are usually very transitory and less effective than synthetic products. However, EOs can be an efficient alternative to conventional plant protection products when properly formulated and integrated with other pest management strategies.</p>
