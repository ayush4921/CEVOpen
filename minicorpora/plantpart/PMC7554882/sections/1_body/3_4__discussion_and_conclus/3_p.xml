<p>To demonstrate persistence and efficiency in the targeted biological system, medium- and long-term effects are most important. To answer these questions, it seems most interesting to deepen the study on the dynamics of the compounds and their fate in plant metabolism in regards to the capacity of the plant to metabolize, detoxify, sequestrate and compartmentalize. Phytotoxicity towards weeds without affecting the crop is essential to develop selective bio-herbicides. In this regard, the identification of other molecular mechanisms such as sugar and amino acid accumulation to prevent EOs stress seems promising as demonstrated in maize [
