<p>A final constraint is the market approval by the different regulatory agencies throughout the world as well as economic considerations. Even if procedures are sometimes available for plant-based products such as GRAS, list 25b of the EPA [

 <xref rid="B126-foods-09-01291" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>], few active substances have been registered so far. Easier registration also leads to misevaluation regarding efficacy and safety for consumers. Indeed, in high concentrations, their use may be economically disadvantageous and exhibit undesirable phytotoxicity [

With controversial products being removed from the market, such as the sprout-preventing chemical chlorpropham (CIPC), alternative products such as EOs are expected to rise. Techno-economic assessments are still lacking regarding a large number of applications. These evaluations combining efficacy, plant safety and social and environmental impacts should clarify many opportunities for the application of EOs [
