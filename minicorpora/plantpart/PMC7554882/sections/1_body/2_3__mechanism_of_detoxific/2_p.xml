<p>Reduction and esterification of aldehydes to their alcohols have been demonstrated for green leaf volatiles such (GLV) as (

 <xref rid="B98-foods-09-01291" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>], but also as previously mentioned for monoterpenes such as citral to nerol and geraniol and limonene to carvacrol [
 <xref rid="B73-foods-09-01291" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Similar reaction pathways were mentioned for citronellal by 
 <italic>Solanum aviculare</italic> suspension cultures to menthane-3,8-diol, citronellol and isopulegol [
 <xref rid="B99-foods-09-01291" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. Wheat seeds exposed to EOs were also able to oxidize and reduce different terpenes, namely neral, geranial, citronellal, pulegone and carvacrol, to the corresponding alcohol and acids using non-specific enzyme systems. The authors have suggested that the reduction activity was catalyzed by non-specific dehydrogenase and oxidation by P-450-type enzymes [

 <italic>Anethum graveolens</italic> hairy root cultures biotransform two oxygen-containing monoterpene substrates, menthol or geraniol in 48 h to menthyl acetate, linalool, Î±-terpineol, citronellol, neral, geranial, citronellyl, neryl, geranyl acetates and nerol oxides [
