<p>Other detoxifying mechanisms rely on conjugation with carbohydrates, or glycosylation, to sequestrate VOC. Compared to the free aglycones, they present a higher solubility in water and a smaller reactivity, which facilitates their storage in the vacuoles and protects from aglycones toxicity [

 <italic>Eucalyptus perriniana</italic> culture cell which converts thymol, carvacrol and eugenol into the corresponding β-glucosides and β-gentiobiosides [

Following the administration of camphor, seven new mono-glucoside products were isolated. Interestingly, the oxygen function was introduced before the glycosylation and ketone group reduction was observed [
