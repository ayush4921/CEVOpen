<p>All the mechanisms involved in the phytotoxicity of EOs cannot be easily interpreted individually [
 <xref rid="B18-foods-09-01291" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This review aims to discuss the latest putative molecular targets (mode of action) involved in plant metabolism with a physiological approach including water status alteration, membrane interaction/disruption, reactive oxygen/nitrogen species induction, genotoxicity and microtubule disruption, mitochondrial respiration or photosynthesis inhibition and enzymatic or phytohormones regulation. The different mechanisms presented throughout this review have been graphically summarized in
