<p>Essential oils (EOs) have been used historically in the food and perfume industries and are extracted from various plant organs (flowers, leaves, barks, wood, roots, rhizomes, fruits and seeds) through steam distillation, hydro-distillation and cold expression for citrus. These natural products are mainly composed of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), having a high vapor pressure at room temperature and belonging mainly to the phenylpropanoid and terpenoid families. Briefly, terpenes are classified according to the number of isoprene sub-units: two for monoterpene (C
 <sub>10</sub>H
 <sub>16</sub>) and three for sesquiterpene (C
 <sub>15</sub>H
 <sub>24</sub>). Oxygenated terpenes or terpenoids also contain additional functional groups such as alcohol, carboxylic acid, ester, etc. [
