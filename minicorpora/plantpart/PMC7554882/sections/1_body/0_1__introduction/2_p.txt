0: Many research studies have been undertaken on the use of EOs in more sustainable agronomic practices.
1: In this regard, numerous findings have described the strong biopesticidal potential of EOs thanks to their antibacterial [ 3], antifungal [ 4], insecticidal [ 5], acaricidal [ 6], nematicidal [ 7] and herbicidal activities [ 8].
2: Included under the Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) product categories of the United States Food and Drug Administration, the impact of EOs on human health and ecosystems seems to be lower compared to synthetic plant protection products (PPP).
3: Biocidal actions of EOs can be specific, and therefore their use could be compatible with integrated pest management (IPM) [ 9].
