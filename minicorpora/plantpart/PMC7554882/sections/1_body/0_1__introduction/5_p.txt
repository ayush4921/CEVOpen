0: All the mechanisms involved in the phytotoxicity of EOs cannot be easily interpreted individually [ 18].
1: This review aims to discuss the latest putative molecular targets (mode of action) involved in plant metabolism with a physiological approach including water status alteration, membrane interaction/disruption, reactive oxygen/nitrogen species induction, genotoxicity and microtubule disruption, mitochondrial respiration or photosynthesis inhibition and enzymatic or phytohormones regulation.
2: The different mechanisms presented throughout this review have been graphically summarized in  Figure 1.
