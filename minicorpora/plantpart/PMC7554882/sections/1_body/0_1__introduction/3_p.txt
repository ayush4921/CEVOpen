0: The application of EOs is, however, subject to a major constraint.
1: They may present phytotoxic properties to untargeted plants such as crops.
2: The most effective EOs in pest control are phytotoxic too, and considerable precautions are required regarding product formulation (unless the objective is the formulation of a total herbicide) [ 10].
3: Empirical tests for commercial EOs are commonly realized on major crops [ 11].
4: However these strategies have led to poor knowledge relating to other biological systems [ 12].
5: Many parameters determine this impact, such as the application mode (root watering, aerial spraying or injection in the vascular system), the plant organs targeted, the phenological stage (seed, plantlet or mature plant), the physiological state and product formulation.
6: As illustrated by the opposing claims regarding the presence or absence of phytotoxicity of  Mentha pulegium (pennyroyal) EOs towards  Cucumis sativus (cucumber) and  Solanum lycopersicum (tomato), it is necessary to gain insight into the molecular mechanism involved in order to design suitable biopesticides [ 13, 14, 15].
