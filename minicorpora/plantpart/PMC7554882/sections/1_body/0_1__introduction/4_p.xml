<p>Phytotoxicity can be defined as a negative impact on plant growth or plant fitness and can be linked to cellular dysfunctions. Physiological impairment can be observed through integrative measurements of stress, for example on the photosynthetic apparatus. However, determination of the primary site of action is much more challenging. Diverse phytochemical products have been demonstrated to influence several physiological processes of growth and development in plant cell division and root elongation [

Blends of natural plant compounds often have numerous mechanisms of action, making them very efficient at acting on a plantâ€™s primary metabolism. It therefore seems most important to gain an insight into the physiological impact of EOs on plant crops to design proper bioassays and efficient biopesticides. Avoiding residual phytotoxicity, which is currently an underestimated constraint in the field, will allow the broader application of EOs [

However even if some processes seem to be inhibited in a dose-dependent manner, a concentration below the phytotoxic threshold could also stimulate the plant, a phenomenon referred to as biostimulation. New opportunities arising from this biostimulation and elicitation of defenses will be discussed in this review.
