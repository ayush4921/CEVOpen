0: Phytotoxicity can be defined as a negative impact on plant growth or plant fitness and can be linked to cellular dysfunctions.
1: Physiological impairment can be observed through integrative measurements of stress, for example on the photosynthetic apparatus.
2: However, determination of the primary site of action is much more challenging.
3: Diverse phytochemical products have been demonstrated to influence several physiological processes of growth and development in plant cell division and root elongation [ 16].
4: Blends of natural plant compounds often have numerous mechanisms of action, making them very efficient at acting on a plants primary metabolism.
5: It therefore seems most important to gain an insight into the physiological impact of EOs on plant crops to design proper bioassays and efficient biopesticides.
6: Avoiding residual phytotoxicity, which is currently an underestimated constraint in the field, will allow the broader application of EOs [ 17].
7: However even if some processes seem to be inhibited in a dose-dependent manner, a concentration below the phytotoxic threshold could also stimulate the plant, a phenomenon referred to as biostimulation.
8: New opportunities arising from this biostimulation and elicitation of defenses will be discussed in this review.
