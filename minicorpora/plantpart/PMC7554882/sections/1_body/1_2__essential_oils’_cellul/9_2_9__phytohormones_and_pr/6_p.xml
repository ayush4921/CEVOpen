<p>The induction of SAR has also been acknowledged when using 
 <italic>Gaultheria procumbens</italic> essential oil, which is composed almost only of methyl salicylate. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the EO, they inoculated GFP-labelled fungal pathogens and showed a strong reduction in its development, similar to commercial solution [

Thyme EO also triggers constitutive defense in tomato against grey mold and fusarium as demonstrated by phenolic compounds and peroxidase activity measurements. Furthermore, root application is more effective than foliar. The authors also suggest that an increase in peroxidase activity resulting from oxidative burst (ROS) is a precursor of phenolic compound accumulation. It seems that activation of a plant defense gene and secondary metabolite production can be attributed to Peroxidase-Mediated Reactive Oxygen Species production [

 <italic>Cinnamomum zeylanicum</italic> oil/trans-cinnamaldehyde [
