<p>A first evidence of the interaction with phytohormones has already been developed previously concerning the gibberellin (GAs). Two other interconnected hormones have been suggested as main targets, auxins and ethylene. Indeed, citral impacts the polar auxins transport, resulting in an alteration of its content, cell division and ultrastructure of

Citral was suggested as a promising herbicide with strong short term and long lasting toxicity. Similar results on polar auxin transportation were obtained with farnesene [

This loss of gravitropism was suggested to result from an alteration in the hormonal balance and stimulation of oxidative stress via ROS and RNS production interfering with cell division and cytokinesis through microtubule disruption altering root morphology.
