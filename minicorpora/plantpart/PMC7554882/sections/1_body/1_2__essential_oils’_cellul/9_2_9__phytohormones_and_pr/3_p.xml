<p>Priming of plant defenses has already been acknowledged in agricultural practices, as for example exposure to mint volatiles, which enhanced transcripts levels of defense genes in soy through histone acetylation within the promoter regions [

Recently, priming against bacteria was observed in apple using thyme oil. Indeed, the authors noted a much stronger expression of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes PR-8 following
