<p>Transcriptomic study following exposure to volatile monoterpenes myrcene and ocimene demonstrated that plants develop a similar response to that induced by methyl jasmonate (MeJA) [
 <xref rid="B92-foods-09-01291" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. Microarray profiling revealed the induction of several hundreds of transcripts annotated as stress or defense genes or transcription factor. Multiple stages of the octadecanoid pathway were present, and metabolite analysis demonstrates an increased level of MeJA in 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic> tissues.
