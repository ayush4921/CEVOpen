<p>Moreover, in a study of photo respiratory pathway alteration by

 <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, Araniti et al. [
 <xref rid="B59-foods-09-01291" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] suggested that alteration of glutamate and aspartate metabolism leads to leaf chlorosis and necrosis. Glutamine synthetase is crucial to incorporate ammonia in organic compounds and may be a molecular target of 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> EO. Finally, ammonia accretion has direct inhibiting properties on PSI and PSII due to its bonding with the oxygen-evolving complex. In addition, the decrease in pH gradients across membranes is able to uncouple photophosphorylation.
