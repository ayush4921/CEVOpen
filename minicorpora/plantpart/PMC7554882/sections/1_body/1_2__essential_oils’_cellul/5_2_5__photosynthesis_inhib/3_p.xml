 <italic>Artemisia fragrans</italic> EO impacts on the photosynthetic apparatus of perennial weed 
 <italic>Convolvulus arvensis</italic> were studied using the most important chlorophyll fluorescence parameters. Increase in minimal fluorescence level (F0) implies a restriction in the PSII transport chain. The decrease in maximum quantum yield of PSII (Fv/Fm) results from photosystem inactivation (photo-damage) and/or a blockade in electron transport. PSII electron transport chain state (Ï†PSII) reduction in plants treated with EOs restricts the non-cyclic electron transport chain. The last two parameters represent energy used in photochemical quenching (qP) and non-photochemical quenching (NPQ). qP decreases following concentration of EOs whereas NQP increases. Taken altogether, these results imply that the excited energy was not used in photosynthesis due to photosystem degradation by EO treatment [
