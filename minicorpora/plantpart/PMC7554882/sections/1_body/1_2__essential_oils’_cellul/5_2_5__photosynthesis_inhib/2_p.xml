<p>Numerous studies report a decrease in the photosynthetic pigments namely chlorophylls (a and b) and carotenoids after treatments with EOs in a dose-dependent way [

 <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis. Plants have developed a non-photochemical quenching (fluorescence) strategy to avoid the ROS production resulting from this photo-inhibition. The decrease in carotenoid content could explain a higher fluorescence emission and a decrease of the PSII performance due to some damage to the complex antenna via ROS production and lipid peroxidation [
