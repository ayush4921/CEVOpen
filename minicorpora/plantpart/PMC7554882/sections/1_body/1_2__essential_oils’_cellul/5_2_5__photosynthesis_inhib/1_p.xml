<p>Photosynthesis inhibition has also been proposed as one of the putative modes of action of EOs. While the impact of certain allelochemicals on photosynthesis is well established, for instance quinone, this is not the case for EOs where numerous mechanisms have been proposed. Direct ROS-mediated disruption through oxidation of photosystem II (PSII) protein has been suggested to inhibit photosynthesis as suggested by the increase in the proline content, whose function is to accept electrons to protect the photosystem [
