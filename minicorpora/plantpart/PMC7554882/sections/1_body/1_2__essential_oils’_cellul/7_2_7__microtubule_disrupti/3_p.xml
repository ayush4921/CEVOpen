<p>More recently, Chaimovitsh et al. [
 <xref rid="B73-foods-09-01291" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] studied microtubule and membrane damages for a large number of terpenes and further demonstrated the difference in their mechanisms of action. In fact, they observed strong microtubule depolarization for limonene and (+)-citronellal and moderate microtubule depolarization for citral, geraniol, (−)-menthone, (+)-carvone and (−)-citronellal. Moreover, many compounds lacked antitubular activity such as pulegone, (−)-carvone, carvacrol, nerol, geranic acid, (+)/(−)-citronellol and citronellic acid. Furthermore, they demonstrated enantioselectivity of microtubule disruption for citronellal and carvone, the (+) enantiomers being more effective. They compared this antitubular activity with the membrane disrupting properties and found that citral did not cause membrane disruption. Carvacrol induced membrane leakage, and limonene both depolymerized microtubules and induced membrane leakage. Finally, through in vivo quantification of applied monoterpene they discover the biotransformation of citral (i) and limonene (ii) to (i) nerol and geraniol and (ii) carvacrol, respectively. This conversion explains the dual mode of action of limonene in both the membrane and microtubule. Dual mode of action was recently highlighted for menthone in tobacco BY-2 plant cells and seedlings of
