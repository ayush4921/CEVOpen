<p>Concerning direct genotoxicity, numerous chromosome abnormalities have been observed, such as sticky chromosome, chromosome bridges, spindle disturbance, c-mitosis and bi-nucleated cells in root tip cells after treatment with EOs of

 <italic>Citrus aurantiifolia</italic>, 
 <italic>Lectranthus amboinicus</italic>, 
 <italic>Mentha longifolia</italic> and 
 <italic>Nepeta nuda</italic>. The damaging reaction of EOs on the chromatin organization could lead to chromosome bridges or sickness and ultimately to apoptosis. Interestingly, different results for EOs with the same principal terpene suggest that there is a synergic interaction between major and minor compounds [
