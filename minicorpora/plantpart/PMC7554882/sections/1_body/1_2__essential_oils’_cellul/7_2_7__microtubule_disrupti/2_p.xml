<p>To determine whether the microtubule impact results from direct depolymerization or from indirect phytohormones balance modification, Gra√±a et al. [
 <xref rid="B72-foods-09-01291" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] studied the short- and long-term effects of citral application in the plant model 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. Auxins (indole 3-acetic acid) polar transport is rapidly inhibited and ethylene content increases. These two hormones have numerous points of interaction and are essential for microtubule organization, which leads to a long-term disorganization of cell ultra-structure. Citral-treated samples present a large number of Golgi complexes together with a thickening of the cell wall. Those phenomena affect cell division and intracellular communication in the long term.
