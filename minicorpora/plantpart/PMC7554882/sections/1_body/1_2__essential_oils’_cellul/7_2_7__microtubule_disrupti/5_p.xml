<p>Another mito-depressive activity of EOs could be mediated by the inhibition of DNA synthesis. It was effectively demonstrated by Nishida et al. [
 <xref rid="B80-foods-09-01291" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>] that monoterpenes are able to hinder organelle and nuclear DNA synthesis. Direct damage to DNA has been highlighted through the effect of EOs on head and tail DNA. Although the mechanisms behind this are still vague, authors suggest that ROS following EO treatments may be responsible for the genotoxic effect [
