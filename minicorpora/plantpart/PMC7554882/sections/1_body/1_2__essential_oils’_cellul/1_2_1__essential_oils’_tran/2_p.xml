<p>When sprayed, the first interaction occurs with the cuticular wax components of the leaves. In fact, the cuticle is considered to be the plant’s first barrier to molecule penetration. The interaction between monoterpene with epicuticular waxes and stomata will be further described. Briefly, once it has entered through the stomata opening by gas exchange or diffusion through the waxy cuticle, each EOC is partitioned into the gas phase and liquid phase following a defined ratio determined by Henry’s law. The liquid phase is materialized by the cell wall in which EOC accumulates. Compounds then diffuse to the cytosol following their oil/water partition coefficients [
