<p>In a similar experiment determining germination and growth inhibition by Î²-pinene EL, lipid peroxidation and lipoxygenase (LOX) activity were assessed. The result showed a strong increase in EL, dienes and H

The damaged was more severe in the root and a higher lipoxygenase activity was observed in parallel with accumulation of MDA [
