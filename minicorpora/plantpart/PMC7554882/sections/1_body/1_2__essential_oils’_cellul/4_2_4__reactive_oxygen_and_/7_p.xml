<p>The generation of ROS, one of the most prevalent plant responses to stress, is described in direct response to the application of EOs. However, it is unlikely to be the main mechanism of toxicity but rather an indirect consequence resulting from LOX activity, chloroplast or mitochondria alteration [

The fundamental involvement of ROS in stress signaling as well as their interaction with other signaling components such as transcription factors, plant hormones, calcium, membrane, G-protein and mitogen-activated protein kinases need to be highlighted [
 <xref rid="B49-foods-09-01291" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. These interactions may explain many of the numerous physiological impacts induced by EOs’ application in plants. Moreover, after treatment with α-farnesene, they also observed the induction of nitric oxide production, a reactive nitrogen species (RNS) associated with an oxidative burst [
