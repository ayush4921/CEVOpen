<p>Oxidative stress was acknowledged after treatment with Î±-pinene through hydrogen peroxide, proline and the lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde (MDA). Moreover, an antioxidant enzyme activity assay (superoxide dismutase, catalase, ascorbate, peroxidase, guaiacol peroxidase and glutathione reductase) was also performed in the roots. The oxidative stress generated by these ROS leads to membrane lipid peroxidation and ultimately to membrane disruption launching the programmed cell death. These membrane disruptions are evidenced via electrolyte leakage (EL) and vital staining [
