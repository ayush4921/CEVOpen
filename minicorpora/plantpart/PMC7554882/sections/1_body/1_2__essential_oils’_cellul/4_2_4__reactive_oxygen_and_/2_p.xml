<p>Oxidative burst or generation of ROS has long been proposed as one of the main mechanisms of action of phytotoxins [

 <sup>2âˆ’</sup>), which are transformed into hydrogen peroxide (H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>) by the superoxide dismutase. Moreover, the reaction with transition metal triggers a reduction of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> to OH
