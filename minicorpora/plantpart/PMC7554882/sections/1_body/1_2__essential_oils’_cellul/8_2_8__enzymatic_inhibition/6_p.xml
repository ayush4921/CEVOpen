<p>More recently, Abdelgaleil, Gouda and Saad [

Indeed, this enzyme plays a key role in the (de)carboxylation reaction involved in both respiration and photosynthesis and contributes to the movement of inorganic carbon to photosynthetic cells. Thus, CO
 <sub>2</sub> content in these cells would decrease, leading to the formation of ROS by diverting a photosynthetic electron from CO
 <sub>2</sub> [
