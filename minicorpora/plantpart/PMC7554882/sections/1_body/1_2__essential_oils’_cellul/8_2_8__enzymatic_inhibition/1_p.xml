<p>Beside glutamine synthetase as a particular enzymatic target of EOs, studies suggest direct or indirect inhibition of specific enzymes as a putative mode of action. For example, a first case is related to the long known potato tuber bud dormancy inhibition using peppermint oil. A decrease in the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl Coenzyme A reductase (HMGR; E.C. 1.1.1.34), a key-enzyme in the mevalonate pathway, was observed but without explanation at the transcriptional level [
