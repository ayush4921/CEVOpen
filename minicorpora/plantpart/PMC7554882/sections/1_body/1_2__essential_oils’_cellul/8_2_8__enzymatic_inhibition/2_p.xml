<p>Rentzsch et al. [
 <xref rid="B84-foods-09-01291" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>] demonstrated a specific monoterpene interaction with gibberellin (GAs) signaling at the dose-, tissue- and gene-level during dormancy release and sprout growth. They also described a typical case of biostimulation. At low concentrations, peppermint essential oil and carvone promote bud sprouting and dormancy release, whereas at high concentrations they completely inhibit it. They demonstrated that dormancy release is associated with tissue-specific α- and β-amylase modulation and that EOs could affect this modulation. Indeed, at low concentration, amylase expressions were modulated by carvone through specific enhancement of a-AMY2 gene transcription by interacting with its transcription factor. This was not the case for peppermint EOs, for which they proposed interaction with specific components of the GAs signaling pathway that enhanced the GAs-mediated responses [
