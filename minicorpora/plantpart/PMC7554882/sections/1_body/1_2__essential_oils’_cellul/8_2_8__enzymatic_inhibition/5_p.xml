<p>Later another target was proposed for the herbicide cinmethylin, the tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT; EC 2.6.1.5). Indeed, TAT provides quinones for the prenylquinones pathway in the inner chloroplast membrane. Furthermore, plastoquinone is a cofactor in the carotenoid pathway. Therefore, the decrease in carotenoid resulting from this inhibition may trigger photo-oxidative degradation of chlorophyll and photosynthetic membranes, disturbing chloroplast function [
