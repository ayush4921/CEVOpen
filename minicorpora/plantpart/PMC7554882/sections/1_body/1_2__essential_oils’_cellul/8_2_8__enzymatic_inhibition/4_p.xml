<p>Strict inhibition phenomena have been proposed for cinmethylin, which is a synthetic analogue of 1,4 and 1,8-cineole through asparagine synthetase inhibition. Authors have suggested that benzyl ether moiety cleaved to generate toxophore that inhibits the enzyme. However due to an inability to reproduce these results in vivo afterwards, the authors decided to retract the paper. This illustrates well the difficulties in rigorously establishing a single molecular target [
