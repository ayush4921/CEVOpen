<p>Associated with the modification of membrane properties, a change in the membraneâ€™s composition also occurs. In fact, an increase in unsaturated fatty acids was demonstrated following application of monoterpenes such as 1,8-cineole, geraniol, thymol, menthol and camphor [

Quantitative and qualitative changes in most abundant free and esterified sterols (sitosterol, stigmasterol, and campesterol) and phospholipid fatty acids (16:0, 16:1, 18:0, 18:1, 18:2, 18:3) were also highlighted in a study investigating the effect of the same monoterpenes [
 <xref rid="B37-foods-09-01291" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. This results in an increase in the percentage of unsaturated fatty acid (PLFAs) and stigmasterol. Interestingly, alcoholic monoterpenes seem to have a different mode of action affecting more unsaturated fatty acid and stigmasterol leading to seedling growth interferences.
