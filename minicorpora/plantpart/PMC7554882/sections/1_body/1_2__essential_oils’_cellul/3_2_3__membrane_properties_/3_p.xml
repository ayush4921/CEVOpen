<p>Studies on artificial monolayer membranes of dipalmitoyl-phosphatildylcholine describe the penetration of monoterpenes such as camphor, cineole, thymol, menthol and geraniol, which affect the vesicles topology [

 <xref rid="B34-foods-09-01291" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. More recently, novel molecular techniques of dynamic interaction were applied to study the interaction between citronellal (monoterpene), citronellol (monoterpene) and cinnamaldehyde (phenylpropanoids) with a biomimetic membrane [
 <xref rid="B35-foods-09-01291" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Briefly, the in silico insertion model predicted different behaviors between the two classes (monoterpenes and phenylpropanoids). These predictions were confirmed using in vitro biophysical assays. Citronellal and citronellol interaction with the model membranes was demonstrated without permeabilizing it, while cinnamaldehyde did not interact with the model membrane. This suggests two different mechanisms of action: (i) the modification of lipid bilayer organization by monoterpenes and (ii) the interaction with membrane receptors for phenylpropanoid pathway metabolites.
