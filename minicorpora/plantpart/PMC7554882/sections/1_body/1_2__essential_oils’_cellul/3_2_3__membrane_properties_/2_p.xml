<p>This interaction can lead to a reversible depolarization of the membrane potential (Vm) and to membrane disruption [

Furthermore, stronger membrane depolarization occurs for more water soluble monoterpenes presenting a low octanol/water partition coefficient (Kow). A change in the polarization state implies ion mobility through the membrane. A drastic entrance of Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> in the cytosol is triggered by opening the calcium channel. Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> is known to be largely involved in cellular signaling. It performs allosteric regulation of many enzymes and proteins. Moreover, Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> is an intracellular second messenger of signal transduction pathways and gene expression. Finally, the increase in Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> concentration can lead to an oxidative burst [
