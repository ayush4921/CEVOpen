<p>The deleterious effect of monoterpene (camphor and menthol) on cuticular wax and stomatal closure inhibition has been observed [
 <xref rid="B25-foods-09-01291" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. These two effects act synergistically on plant transpiration leading to guard cell disruption and desiccation. Interestingly, an opposite growth promoting effect is described for 
 <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> during short vapor exposure to these terpenes. The molecular mechanism responsible for this prevention of stomatal closure is mediated through modification in the cytoskeleton and especially in the actin filament. Furthermore, stress symptoms appear together with a change in gene expression [
