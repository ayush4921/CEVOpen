<p>Accessibility to mitochondria in vivo can strongly affect phytotoxicity. A study performed using soy hypocotyl showed that the effect on mitochondria alone did not fully explain the resulting phytotoxic effect. Absence of correlation between respiratory inhibition in mitochondria and seed germination or root growth treated with Î±-pinene and limonene suggest that their inhibition properties are probably dependent on their ability to permeate intracellular compartments [
