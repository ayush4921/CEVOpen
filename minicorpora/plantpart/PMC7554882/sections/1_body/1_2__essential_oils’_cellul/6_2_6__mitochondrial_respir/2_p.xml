<p>The effect of monoterpenes has been well documented on isolated mitochondria, on germination and on primary root growth of maize [

Briefly, the authors demonstrated that Î±-pinene triggers two different mechanisms which are the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation and the inhibition of electron transfer. This action drastically decreases adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production and the authors suggest it occurs following unspecific disruption in the inner mitochondrial membrane [
