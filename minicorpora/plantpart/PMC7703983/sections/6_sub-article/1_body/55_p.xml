<p>Revision: Thank you for your comments. Fig4 showed Gene ontology (GO) histogram of classification in annotated unigenes WZ (Wenzhou) versus HK (Haikou). The functions of the unique sequences extracted from C. wenyujin were classified based on the three GO terms: cellular component (CC), biological process (BP), and molecular function (MF), The DEGs were mainly assigned to ‘cell, go: 0005623’, ‘cell part, go: 0044464’, ‘organelle, go: 0043226’, ‘membrane, go: 0016020’,‘cellular process, go: 0009987’, ‘metabolic process, go: 0008152’, ‘single-organism process, go: 0044699’, ‘binding, go: 0005488’, and ‘catalytic activity, go: 0003824’ (Fig 4). and We had some KEEG and GO enrichment analysis seen in lines 405-418 and 446-458 in the revised manuscript and related enrichment information was seen in S9, S10 Table and S1 File. We will conduct more in-depth research in the future on the significance of enrichment analysis.</p>
