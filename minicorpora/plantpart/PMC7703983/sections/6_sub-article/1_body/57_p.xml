<p>Revision: Thank you for your comments. Make clear the number of genes shown in this figure is 4620. These genes were chosen because of a significant difference in these genes between WZ and HK . the values of up/down regulated" in this figure were those of WZ compared HK. And the labels in the columns have been replaced by their real labels (HK1, HK2, HK3, WZ1, WZ2, WZ3) in Fig 7 in the revised manuscript.</p>
