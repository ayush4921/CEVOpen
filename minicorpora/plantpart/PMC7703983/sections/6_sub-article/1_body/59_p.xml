<p>Revision: Thank you for your comments, We mean that 26 COG functional classifications of consensus sequence of DEGs between HK and WZ are shown in Fig 8, not a comparison of DEGs in 26 COG classifications between HK and WZ is shown in Fig 8. We have revised it seen in Line 409. We have showed the number of annotated genes in main eight categories and the ratio of DEG to the annotated genes, seen in lines 424-432in the revised manuscript.</p>
