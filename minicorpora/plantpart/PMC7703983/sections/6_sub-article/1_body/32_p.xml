<p>The authors analyzed C. wenyujin rhizomes in two different locations and showed that the difference in metabolome and transcriptome were consistent. The conclusion sounds OK but there are so many points to be improved in figures, statistical analysis and sentences. The comparison along the metabolic pathway, and their conclusion would be OK. However, the distribution of transcriptome should be evaluated and normalized before detail statistical analysis such as DEG. Also, the detail about clustering analysis and enrichment analysis are not clear to evaluate them.</p>
