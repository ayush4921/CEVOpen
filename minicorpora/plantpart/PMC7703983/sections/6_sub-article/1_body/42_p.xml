<p>Revision: Thank you for your comments. "DESeq" is revised for a name of a function in the R package. The P value results were regulated using the Benjamin and Hochberg method (1995) for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR), and genes at a P value &lt; 0.05 were classified as differentially expressed genes (DEGs), in lines L198-202 in the revised manuscript.</p>
