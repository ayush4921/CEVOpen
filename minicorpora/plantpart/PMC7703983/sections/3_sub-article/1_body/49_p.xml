<p>Reviewer #1: Curcumae Rhizoma, known as Ezhu (Chinese), and Curcumae Radix, known as Yujin (Chinese), are different plant parts coming from three same species of Curcuma according to China Pharmacopoeia. The Chinese Pharmacopoeia recorded that Curcumae Radix should be the dry radix of Curcuma wenyujin Y. H. Chen and C. Ling, C. longa L., C. kwangsiensis S. G. Lee, and C. phaeocaulis Valeton. And Curcumae Rhizoma should be the dry rhizomes derived from the above-mentioned species except C. longa L. They are similar in source but different in medicinal parts. Curcumae Rhizoma and Curcumae Radix are confused in variety and source, even in clinical trials by some nonprofessional workers. So, it is important for us to make them clear. Also, genotype and environment interaction is high for secondary metabolites in Curcuma sp. The main objective of the present study was to analyze the constituents of essential oils such as terpene, curcumin, polysaccharide, starch, and other important substances from C. Wenyujin rhizomes from the traditional (Wenzhou) and introduced (Haikou) production areas. In this study authors also attempted comparative RNAseq profiles of C. Wenyujin rhizomes produced in traditional (Wenzhou) and introduced (Haikou) areas. The study has some interesting findings in the poorly understood crop species of Curcuma.</p>
