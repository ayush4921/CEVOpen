 <p>For more than a thousand years, Rhizoma Curcumae (known as 
  <italic>E zhu</italic>), a Chinese herbal medicine, has been used to eradicate blood stasis and relieve aches. The plant 
  <italic>Curcuma wenyujin</italic>, which is grown primarily in Wenzhou, China, is considered the best source of Rhizoma Curcumae. In this study, we sought to ascertain differences in transcript profiles of 
  <italic>C</italic>. 
  <italic>wenyujin</italic> grown in traditional (Wenzhou) and recently established (Haikou) production areas based on Illumina and RNA (RNA-seq) sequencing. We also examined differences in the main components of the volatile oil terpene; curcumin, polysaccharide, and starch constituents and related genes in the corresponding pathways, in 
  <italic>C</italic>. 
  <italic>wenyujin</italic> cultivated in the two production areas. We accordingly found that the essential oil (2.05%), curcumin (1.46%), and polysaccharide (8.90%) content in Wenzhou rhizomes was higher than that in the rhizomes of plants from Haikou (1.60%, 0.91%, and 6.15%, respectively). In contrast, the starch content of Wenzhou rhizomes (17.0%) was lower than that of Haikou rhizomes (23.8%). Furthermore, we detected significant differences in the oil components of Haikou and Wenzhou rhizomes, with curzerene (32.34%), curdione (21.35%), and germacrene B (9.39%) being the primary components of the essential oil derived from Wenzhou rhizomes, and curzerene (20.13%), curdione (14.73%), and cineole (9.76%) being the main constituents in Haikou rhizomes. Transcriptome and qPCR analyses revealed considerable differences in gene expression between Wenzhou and Haikou rhizomes. The expression of terpene, curcumin, and polysaccharide pathway-related genes in Wenzhou rhizomes was significantly up-regulated, whereas the expression of starch-associated genes was significantly down-regulated, compared with those in Haikou rhizomes. Difference in the content of terpene, curcumin, polysaccharides, and starch in rhizomes from the two production areas could be explained in terms of differences in expression of the related genes.
