 <caption> A Gene Ontology (GO) histogram of the classification of annotated unigenes that were differentially expressed between Wenzhou (WZ) and Haikou (HK) rhizomes. The red, green, and blue histograms represent the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the different sub-categories, whereas the light red, green, and blue histograms represent the annotated unigenes. The right-hand Y-axis represents the number of annotated genes or DEGs in the main categories, and the left-hand Y-axis represents the percentage of annotated unigenes or DEGs in the main categories. </caption>
