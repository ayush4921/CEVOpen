 <caption> qRT-PCR verification of genes that were differentially expressed between Wenzhou (WZ) and Haikou (HK) rhizomes (a) and the corresponding verification based on RNA-seq (b). Using c121677 as a control/reference gene, the relative expression of genes was calculated using the 2- ΔΔCt method. Asterisks denote significant differences (*, P &lt; 0.05; **, P &lt; 0.01; ***, P &lt; 0.001). Error bars represent the standard deviations of mean values (n = 6). (CHS2: chalcone synthase2; CHS1: chalcone synthase1; TT4: chalcone and stilbene synthase family protein; LPS: levopimaradiene synthase; CDS/LIS: 3S-linalool synthase; ISPS: isoprene synthase; TPS06: dolabella-3,7-dien-18-ol synthase/sesquiterpene synthase 6; GAE: UDP-glucuronate 4-epimerase; PME: pectin methylesterase; BGLU: beta-glucosidase; SUS: sucrose synthase; TSTA: GDP- l-fucose synthase; GALE: UDP-glucose 4-epimerase; GH: glycoside hydrolase; LOC103985749: uncharacterized protein LOC103985749). </caption>
