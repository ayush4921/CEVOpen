  <title>A Gene Ontology (GO) histogram of the classification of annotated unigenes that were differentially expressed between Wenzhou (WZ) and Haikou (HK) rhizomes.</title>
  <p>The red, green, and blue histograms represent the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the different sub-categories, whereas the light red, green, and blue histograms represent the annotated unigenes. The right-hand Y-axis represents the number of annotated genes or DEGs in the main categories, and the left-hand Y-axis represents the percentage of annotated unigenes or DEGs in the main categories.</p>
