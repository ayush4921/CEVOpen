0: Isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) is an important intermediate in the biosynthesis of terpenoids and steroids in plants, and steroidal alkaloids can also be formed through other pathways.
1: IPP is formed as a common intermediate in both the mevalonate (MVA) and 2-methyl- d-erythritol-4-phosphoric acid (MEP) pathways, and can pass through cell walls to transfer between these two pathways [ 29].
2: Abiotic environmental factors (including light, temperature, moisture, and nutrition) affect metabolism and the synthesis of metabolites, predominantly by influencing gene expression and transcriptional factors in the associated metabolic pathways (e.g., MVA and MEP) of secondary metabolites, such as terpenoids, flavonoids and flavonols [ 30 38].
3: Thus, it is speculated that variations in natural environmental conditions in the Wenzhou and Haikou regions, which are characterized by subtropical monsoon and tropical monsoon climates, respectively, may contribute to notable differences in the secondary metabolite profiles of  C.  wenyujin rhizomes sourced from these two regions.
