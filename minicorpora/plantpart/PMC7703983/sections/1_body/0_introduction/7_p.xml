<p>In this study, using Illumina and RNA (RNA-seq) sequencing, we examined the transcript profiles of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>wenyujin</italic> rhizomes produced in the traditional production area (Wenzhou) and those derived from an area in which the plant has recently been introduced (Haikou). We also sought to determine variations in the content of the main components of the volatile oil terpene, curcumin, polysaccharides, and starch, and related genes in the corresponding pathways. The data, thus, obtained provide a basis for evaluating the quality of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>wenyujin</italic> and elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying the biosynthetic pathways in plants cultivated in these two production areas, and hence will enable us to assess the potential medicinal value, development, and utilization of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>wenyujin</italic> in more agriculturally productive areas, such as Haikou.
