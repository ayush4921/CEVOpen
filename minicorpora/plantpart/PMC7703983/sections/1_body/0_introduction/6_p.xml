<p>In recent years, drug companies (such as Haikou Bikai Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd) in Haikou, Hainan Province, have introduced the local cultivation of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>wenyujin</italic> using plant material originally sourced from Ruian, Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province [

 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>wenyujin</italic> is cultivated in Haikou for the production of medicines derived from this plant, with the goal of meeting the growing demand for 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>wenyujin</italic> constituents (volatile oils, crude extracts, and raw materials). In this study, we sought to determine the main constituents and genetic characteristics of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>wenyujin</italic> rhizomes sourced from Wenzhou and Haikou, with the aim of assessing the qualities of the respective 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>wenyujin</italic> rhizomes. The main objective was to analyze the content of essential oils (such as terpene), curcumin, polysaccharides, and starch in 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>wenyujin</italic> rhizomes obtained from the traditional production areas (Wenzhou) and newly established production areas (Haikou). In this regard, although there have been a few transcriptome studies on plants in the ginger family (e.g.,

 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>wenyujin</italic>. Moreover, there have been only a limited number of studies on the transcriptome of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>wenyujin</italic> and the mechanisms underlying interspecific differences in the primary and secondary metabolites that accumulate in the rhizomes of
