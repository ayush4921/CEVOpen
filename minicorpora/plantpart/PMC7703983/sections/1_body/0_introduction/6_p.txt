0: In recent years, drug companies (such as Haikou Bikai Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd) in Haikou, Hainan Province, have introduced the local cultivation of  C.  wenyujin using plant material originally sourced from Ruian, Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province [ 39].
1: C.  wenyujin is cultivated in Haikou for the production of medicines derived from this plant, with the goal of meeting the growing demand for  C.  wenyujin constituents (volatile oils, crude extracts, and raw materials).
2: In this study, we sought to determine the main constituents and genetic characteristics of  C.  wenyujin rhizomes sourced from Wenzhou and Haikou, with the aim of assessing the qualities of the respective  C.  wenyujin rhizomes.
3: The main objective was to analyze the content of essential oils (such as terpene), curcumin, polysaccharides, and starch in  C.  wenyujin rhizomes obtained from the traditional production areas (Wenzhou) and newly established production areas (Haikou).
4: In this regard, although there have been a few transcriptome studies on plants in the ginger family (e.g.,  Curcuma zedoaria (Christm.)
5: Roscoe) [ 40 42], to date there have been no studies that have examined genetic variations in the metabolic pathways of  C.  wenyujin.
6: Moreover, there have been only a limited number of studies on the transcriptome of  C.  wenyujin and the mechanisms underlying interspecific differences in the primary and secondary metabolites that accumulate in the rhizomes of  C.  wenyujin rhizomes cultivated in traditional and non-traditional production areas.
