0: C.  wenyujin is mainly cultivated in China, wherein the quality of the rhizomes varies substantially depending on the variety, cultivation region, cultivation techniques, and extraction methods [ 11,  18,  19].
1: C.  wenyujin cultivated in different regions, for example, the traditional and non-traditional producing areas, can differ notably with respect to oil components.
2: Given that different environmental conditions can promote changes in the active constituents and alter the transcriptional regulation of genes that control the formation of secondary metabolites, the same  C.  wenyujin genotype can produce rhizomes with differing qualities depending on the region in and conditions under which the plants are cultivated, and consequently this can potentially present difficulties with respect to quality control.
