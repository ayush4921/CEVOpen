 <italic>wenyujin</italic> cultivated in different regions, for example, the traditional and non-traditional producing areas, can differ notably with respect to oil components. Given that different environmental conditions can promote changes in the active constituents and alter the transcriptional regulation of genes that control the formation of secondary metabolites, the same
