0: A notable characteristic of plants is their plasticity in response to unfavorable environmental conditions [ 20,  21].
1: Plants typically initiate a series of specific biochemical responses to environmental stressors associated with diverse aspects of their biology, including development, evolution, molecular biology, anatomy, physiology, genetics, and biochemistry [ 22,  23], which are of particular importance from the perspectives of predicting changes in community composition, distribution, and crop productivity in response to continuously changing environments [ 24,  25].
