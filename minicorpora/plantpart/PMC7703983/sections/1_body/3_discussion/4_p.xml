<p>Overall, we found that 980 DEGs were allocated to KEGG pathways, among which those associated with spliceosome, endoplasmic reticulum protein processing, ribosome, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, RNA transport, phagosome, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, and glutathione metabolism were predominantly enriched. With respect to up-regulated DEGs, pathways associated with spliceosome, carbon metabolism, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, proteasome, citrate cycle (TCA cycle), aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, arginine and proline metabolism, and glutathione metabolism were predominantly enriched, whereas for the down-regulated DEGs, pathways relating to ribosome, starch and sucrose metabolism, endoplasmic reticulum protein processing, plant hormone signal transduction, protein export, and riboflavin metabolism were significantly enriched. These findings are thus indicative of the active biosynthesis of not only secondary but also primary metabolites. Conversely, we noted that plant hormone signal transduction and starch and sucrose metabolism were inhibited and down-regulated in the rhizomes of
