<p>When exposed to abiotic stresses, such as drought and elevated temperatures, plants respond by expressing a range transcription factors, induced via a series of signaling pathways. The stimulated transcription factors bind to corresponding 
 <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements to initiate specific patterns of gene expression to counter the adverse effects of abiotic stress. Plant transcription factors known to respond to abiotic stress mainly include those in the

 <italic>C2H2</italic> and
