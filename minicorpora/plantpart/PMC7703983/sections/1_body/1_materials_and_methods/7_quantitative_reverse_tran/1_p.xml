<p>qPCR analysis was performed using an IQ5 Multicolor (CFX96) PCR detection system (Bio-Rad, Bole, USA) and a Power PCR Master Mix (SYBR green) (Takara, Beijing, China). RNase-free DNase (TaKaRa, Beijing, China) was used to extract the total RNA from the

 <italic>wenyujin</italic> rhizomes, and 15 primers (Oligod-T) and a SuperScript (III) RT kit (Invitrogen, USA) were used for the reverse transcription (RT) reaction. For each RT reaction, we used 20 μL reaction mixtures containing 10 μL of master mix reagent (2× SYBR Green Master) (TaKaRa, Beijing, China), 10 ng of sample (cDNA), and 200 nM of gene-specific primers. The cycle conditions were as follows: an initial denaturation at 95°C for 30 s, followed by 40 cycles at 95°C for 5 s and 60°C for 34 s. The amplification program was then followed by a 55°C–85°C melting curve analysis, with each temperature maintained for 5 s. For PCR amplification, we used gene-specific primers (

The relative expression values of the target genes were calculated by comparing the target gene cycle thresholds (CTs) with those of the c121677 housekeeping gene using the 2
