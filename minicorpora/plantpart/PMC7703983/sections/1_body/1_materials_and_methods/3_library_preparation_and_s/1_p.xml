<p>An RNA library was prepared using a total of 3 μg RNA per sample, which was analyzed using high-throughput Illumina sequencing technology at the Beijing BioMarker Technologies Company (Beijing, China). An RNA Library Prep Kit (NEB for Illumina, USA) was used for generating sequencing libraries, in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations, and the sequences of each sample were attributed using index codes. mRNA was extracted from the total RNA using Poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads. Fragmentation of the sequences was facilitated by crushing the samples in the presence of divalent cations in a NEBNext first-chain synthetic buffer (5×) at an elevated temperature. First-chain cDNA synthesis was performed using RNase-H (Invitrogen, USA), and Polymerase I (Invitrogen, USA) and RNase-H (Invitrogen, USA) were used for second-chain cDNA synthesis. The remaining overhangs were blunt-ended based on polymerase or exonuclease reactions. Subsequent to adenylation of the DNA fragments (3ʹ ends), the junction (NEBNext), with a hairpin loop structure, was ligated in preparation for hybridization. To preferentially select cDNA fragments of 150–200 bp in length, we used an XP system (AMP, Beckman Coulter, Beverly, USA) to separate the DNA fragments. Prior to PCR, 3 μL USER enzyme (NEB, USA) was added to the samples containing the size-selected adaptor-ligated cDNA, which were heated at 37°C for 15 min, followed by 95°C for 5 min. PCR was carried out using DNA polymerase (Phusion High-Fidelity), Index (X), and Universal Primers (PCR), and the XP system (AMP, Beckman Coulter, Beverly, USA) was applied to purify the PCR products. Library quality was evaluated using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer system (Nano 6000; Agilent Technologies, CA, USA).</p>
