<p>Similarly, functional analyses of the DEGs based on the KEGG classification of enriched pathways revealed that with respect to all genes differentially expressed between WZ and HK, 179 pathways showed enrichment, among which there were 117 and 62 pathways associated with up- and down-regulated DEGs, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0242776.s017">S10 Table</xref>). For these pathways, we analyzed the significance of the enrichment factor and Q values, and in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0242776.g009">Fig 9</xref>, we present the first 20 minimal Q value pathways. In total, 980 DEGs were assigned to KEGG pathways, among which, 844 and 136 were up- and down-regulated, respectively. The dominant and significantly enriched pathways are listed in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0242776.s017">S10 Table</xref>. With respect to all DEGs, the predominantly enriched KEGG pathways associated with the following functional areas: ribosome, spliceosome, endoplasmic reticulum protein processing, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, RNA transport, phagosome, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, and glutathione metabolism. Pathways predominantly enriched with the up-regulated DEGs included spliceosome, carbon metabolism, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, proteasome, citrate cycle (TCA cycle), aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, arginine and proline metabolism, and glutathione metabolism, whereas those significantly enriched the down-regulated DEGs included ribosome, protein export, riboflavin metabolism, endoplasmic reticulum protein processing, plant hormone signal transduction, starch and sucrose metabolism.
