 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0242776.g008">Fig 8</xref> shows the results of our COG functional classifications of the consensus sequences of genes that were differentially expressed between WZ and HK. The 1,698 genes that were differentially expressed between the rhizomes obtained from these two sources can primarily be divided into the following eight categories: general function prediction only (R) (481, 28.33%); transcription (K) (230, 13.55%); replication, recombination, and repair (L) (208, 12.25%); signal transduction mechanisms (T) (190, 11.19%); translation ribosomal structure and biogenesis (J) (189, 11.13%); posttranslational modification protein turnover chaperones (O) (178, 10.48%); amino acid transport and metabolism (E) (153, 9.01%); and carbohydrate transport and metabolism (G) (140, 8.24%). The corresponding numbers and percentages of the annotated genes in these eight categories are as follows: R (2,427, 19.82%), K (415, 55.42%), L (512, 40.63%), T (405, 46.91%), J (1,426, 13.25%), O (1,373, 12.96%), E (892, 17.15%), and G (765, 18.30%). Thus, the genes associated with these eight categories can be assumed play vital roles in the growth of
