<p>Our analyses revealed notable differences in the rhizome (
 <italic>E zhu</italic>) structure and volatile oil color and content of the 
 <italic>Curcuma wenyujin</italic> samples obtained from the two different regions. The volatile oil content of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>wenyujin</italic> rhizomes derived from Wenzhou was found to be higher than that in the rhizomes from Haikou, and these oils were characterized by bright and dark yellow colors, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0242776.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Paraffin sections of rhizome tissue, stained using the periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) reaction and potassium iodide, revealed the cellular localization of oil and the quantity of starch granules, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0242776.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The oil (2.05%), curcumin (1.46%), and polysaccharide (8.90%) content of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>wenyujin</italic> rhizomes from Wenzhou was significantly higher than that of rhizomes from Haikou (1.60%, 0.91%, and 6.15%, respectively), whereas the starch content of rhizomes from Wenzhou (17.0%) was significantly lower than that of rhizomes from Haikou (23.8%) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0242776.g003">Fig 3</xref>). We also detected significant differences in the compositions of the volatile oils derived from the rhizomes of plants obtained from the two cultivation regions, with the content of curzerene and curdione being higher in those from Wenzhou (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0242776.s010">S3 Table</xref>). Curzerene (32.34%), curdione (21.35%), and germacrene B (9.39%) were found to be the major components of the essential oil of rhizomes from Wenzhou, whereas in the rhizomes harvested from Haikou, curzerene (20.13%), curdione (14.73%), and cineole (9.76%) were identified as the main essential oil constituents. Thus, the chemical constituents of essential oils in the rhizomes of Wenzhou- and Haikou-cultivated 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>wenyujin</italic> appear to be quite different.
