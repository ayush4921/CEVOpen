<p>To analyze the dynamics of mRNA expression in

 <italic>wenyujin</italic> from different production areas, we constructed and sequenced mRNA-seq libraries for 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>wenyujin</italic> derived from Haikou (introduced cultivation) (HK) and Wenzhou (traditional cultivation) (WZ). A comparison of three replicates of the two experimental groups verified that they do not differ significantly at the sequence level (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0242776.s013">S6</xref> Tables). Sequencing of a total of six transcriptome samples (HK1, HK2, HK3, WZ1, WZ2, and WZ3) yielded a total of 41.74 Gbp of clean data (reaching up to at least 6.37 Gbp for each sample), with Q30 percentages (number of samples with Phred quality score higher than 30) of more than 89.15% in the mRNA-seq libraries of the six samples (
