<p>The functions of the unique sequences extracted from 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>wenyujin</italic> were classified based on the three GO terms cellular component (CC), biological process (BP), and molecular function (MF). Compared with HK, 15,151 unigenes and 924 DEGs in WZ were classified as CC; 19,906 unigenes and 1,276 DEGs were classified as BP; and 21,535 unigenes and 1,456 DEGs were classified as MF. The DEGs were mainly assigned to the categories “cell, go: 0005623,” “cell part, go: 0044464,” “organelle, go: 0043226,” “membrane, go: 0016020,” “cellular process, go: 0009987,” “metabolic process, go: 0008152,” “single-organism process, go: 0044699,” “binding, go: 0005488,” and “catalytic activity, go: 0003824” (
