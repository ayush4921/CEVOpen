<p>To determine similarities and differences in the transcriptional changes of genes in WZ and HK 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>wenyujin</italic>, we performed hierarchical clustering, which accordingly revealed differences in the expression patterns of genes in the two sources of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>wenyujin</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0242776.g007">Fig 7</xref>). A subset of transcripts, together with their respective fold changes and false discovery rate-corrected 
 <italic>P</italic>-values, for both clusters, are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0242776.s015">S8 Table</xref>. Among these, genes related to terpene, curcumin, and polysaccharide pathways were found to be up-regulated in 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>wenyujin</italic> from Wenzhou, where genes associated with starch and sugar pathways were up-regulated in 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>wenyujin</italic> from Haikou.
