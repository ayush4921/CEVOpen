<p>To establish the reliability of the FPKM procedure, we selected the sequences of 15 of the DEGs that are involved in terpene, curcumin, polysaccharide, and starch pathways for qRT-PCR analysis. Our findings that the overall correlation coefficient of the linear regression analysis between FPKM and qRT-PCR was 0.959 (R = 0.959) indicated a good correlation between the transcript abundance detected by RT-PCR and the transcription spectrum of RNA sequence data analysis (

Data obtained from RNA-seq and qRT-PCR analyses revealed that those genes associated with terpene (LPS, CDS/LIS, ISPS, and TPS06), curcumin (CHS2, CHS1, and TT4), and polysaccharide (TSTA, GALE, and GH) pathways were significantly up-regulated in the rhizomes of
