<p>In summary, our findings indicate that the content of volatile oil, curcumin, and polysaccharides in the rhizomes of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>wenyujin</italic> cultivated in the Wenzhou production region is higher than those in the rhizomes of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>wenyujin</italic> grown in Haikou, whereas the content of starch is lower. We also detected significant differences in the constituents of the volatile oils of rhizomes obtained from the two production areas. Transcriptome analysis revealed notable differences in the gene expression patterns of rhizomes sourced from the Wenzhou and Haikou regions. We found that the expression of genes in pathways related to volatile oil, curcumin, and polysaccharide was significantly up-regulated in Wenzhou rhizomes, whereas that of starch-associated genes was significantly down-regulated, compared with those in Haikou rhizomes. Moreover, we identified the significantly up-regulated expression of transcription factors (including those in the

 <italic>wenyujin</italic>, which are assumed to reflect differences in environmental factor characterizing the two examined production regions. We also describe new methodologies that may prove beneficial with respect to evaluating the authenticity of Chinese herbal medicines.
