 <p>Plants in the genus 
  <italic>Melaleuca</italic> have been widely used as traditional medicine mainly because of their broad spectrum antimicrobial activity. In this study, we reported the complete chloroplast genome of 
  <italic>Melaleuca cajuputi</italic> subsp. 
  <italic>cumingiana</italic>. The chloroplast genome of this species is 158,855 bp in length, including a pair of inverted repeat regions (IRs) (26,727 bp) that is divided by a large single-copy (LSC) area (87,338 bp) and a small single-copy (SSC) area (18,063 bp). The circular chloroplast genome of 
  <italic>M. cajuputi</italic> subsp. 
  <italic>cumingiana</italic> contains 135 unique genes, composing of 87 protein-coding genes, 40 tRNA genes, and eight rRNA genes. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that 
  <italic>M. cajuputi</italic> subsp. 
  <italic>cumingiana</italic> was clustered with species in the tribe Melaleuceae. This complete chloroplast genome of 
  <italic>M. cajuputi</italic> subsp. 
  <italic>cumingiana</italic> will provide a powerful tool to accelerate breeding, biotechnological and phylogenetic study.
