<p>In higher plants, chloroplast genome is often used for phylogenetic analysis and domestication studies (Jansen et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). The whole chloroplast genome sequences also have demonstrated the potential to understand structure and functional evolution (Jansen et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Moore et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). In genus 
 <italic>Melaleuca</italic>, the chloroplast genome such as 
 <italic>M. alternifolia</italic> and 
 <italic>M. rigidus</italic> (which was initially described as a member of the genus 
 <italic>Callistemon</italic>) has been reported (Liu et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>), but the chloroplast genome of 
 <italic>M. cajuputi</italic> has not been reported. Here, we sequenced and analyzed the complete chloroplast genome sequence of 
 <italic>M. cajuputi</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>cumingiana</italic> based on the Illumina sequencing data. The objective of this study was to characterize the complete chloroplast genome sequence of 
 <italic>M. cajuputi</italic> as a resource for future genetic studies on this and other related species.
