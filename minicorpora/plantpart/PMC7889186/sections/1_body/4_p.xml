<p>To confirm the phylogenetic position of 
 <italic>M. cajuputi</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>cumingiana</italic>, the complete chloroplast genomes of 16 published species within Myrtaceae and one outgroup (
 <italic>Punica granatum</italic>, Lythraceae, MK603512) were downloaded from the NCBI GenBank database. Ninety-four chloroplast genes shared by all species in this analysis were extracted, and were aligned by using MUSCLE (Edgar 
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). We concatenated these genes and then constructed a maximum-likelihood tree (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>) using IQ-TREE (Nguyen et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Phylogenetic analysis strongly supported that 
 <italic>M. cajuputi</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>cumingiana</italic> was closely related to species in tribe Melaleuceae (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>), which is consistent with the previous study in Myrtaceae (Thornhill et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). In addition, phylogenetic position of 
 <italic>Melaleuca rigidus</italic>, initially described as 
 <italic>Callistemon rigidus</italic>, also supported the sinking of 
 <italic>Callistemon</italic> into 
 <italic>Melaleuca</italic> (Craven 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). In conclusion, we assembled the first chloroplast genome of 
 <italic>M. cajuputi</italic> and it will provide a solid foundation for phylogenetic and evolutionary studies in 
 <italic>Melaleuca</italic> and is expected to contribute to improving 
 <italic>M. cajuputi</italic> breeding.
