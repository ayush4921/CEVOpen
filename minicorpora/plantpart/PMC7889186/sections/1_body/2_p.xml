<p>Voucher specimens of 
 <italic>M. cajuputi</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>cumingiana</italic> were collected from South China Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Guangzhou, China; 113°21′7″E, 23°10′47″N), and deposited at the herbarium of South China Botanical Garden (accession number: SCBG-CF-2071). Total genomic DNA was extracted from fresh leaves using the CTAB-chloroform protocol (Doyle and Doyle 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>). The high-throughput sequencing (pair-end 150 bp) was performed on an Illumina XTen platform and it generated ∼3.07 Gb raw data. The cp genome was assembled by using the program NOVOPlasty (Dierckxsens et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). A ribulose-1, 5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (
 <italic>rbcL</italic>) gene sequence from 
 <italic>M. alternifolia</italic> (GenBank accession no. MN310606) was used as seed sequence, and the whole cp genome sequence of 
 <italic>M. alternifolia</italic> and 
 <italic>Eucalyptus grandis</italic> (GenBank accession no. NC_014570) was used as a reference to resolve the inverted repeat (IR) in the chloroplast genome of 
 <italic>M. cajuputi</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>cumingiana</italic>. The assembled chloroplast genome was annotated using PGA (Qu et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) and GeSeq (Tillich et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). For necessary genes, positions of start and stop codons and boundaries between exons and introns were manually corrected. The annotated chloroplast genomic sequence has been deposited in GenBank with an accession number: MT731621.
