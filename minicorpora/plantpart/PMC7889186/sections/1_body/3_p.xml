<p>The complete chloroplast genome of 
 <italic>M. cajuputi</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>cumingiana</italic> is 158,855 bp in length, and has a typical quadripartite construction, which contains two inverted repeat regions (IRa and IRb) of 26,727 bp that is insulated by a large single-copy (LSC, 87,338 bp) and a small single-copy (SSC, 18,063 bp). The total GC content of complete chloroplast genome, LSC, SSC, IR regions is 36.8%, 55.0%, 11.4%, and 33.6%, respectively. The complete chloroplast genome of 
 <italic>M. cajuputi</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>cumingiana</italic> contains 135 unique genes, including 87 protein-coding genes, 40 tRNA genes, and eight rRNA genes. Introns are present in 19 of the annotated genes. Five of the intron containing genes contain three exons. Most of these genes are single-copy genes. However, 19 genes were duplicated in IR regions.
