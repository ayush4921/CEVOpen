<p>Plants belonging to 
 <italic>Melaleuca</italic> L. genus (Myrtaceae family) have been used as traditional medicine for many years (Sharifi-Rad et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), mainly because of their broad spectrum antimicrobial activity (Zhang et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). 
 <italic>Melaleuca cajuputi</italic> Powell is a multi-purpose tree as its piles and frame poles provide construction materials, leaves produce essential oil, flowers attract honey bees (Doran and Turnbull 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Quat and Cuong 
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>), and timbers can be used for pulp, fiber, and particle board (Trung 
 <xref rid="CIT0423" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). In recent years, this plant was also developed for allelopathic herbicides instead of chemical herbicides (Kueh et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). There are three recognized subspecies: 
 <italic>cajuputi</italic>, 
 <italic>cumingiana</italic>, and 
 <italic>platyphylla</italic> (Craven and Barlow 
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>), which are native to Australia and adjacent areas such as Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, and Malaysia (Brophy et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Breeding program of 
 <italic>M. cajuputi</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>cajuputi</italic> has mainly targeted essential oil yield (Kartikawati et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), while 
 <italic>M. cajuputi</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>cumingiana</italic> Barlow was widely planted for its wood production (Thiet et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Nguyen et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). However, only a few genomic resources have been reported in this species (Beheregaray and Sunnucks 
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>).
