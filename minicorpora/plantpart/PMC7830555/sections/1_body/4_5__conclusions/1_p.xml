<p>The limited range of conventional and effective antifungal agents against 
 <italic>Trichophyton</italic> spp. and the possible appearance of unpleasant adverse effects on the host are linked to safety problems and have lead to the search for a new, effective broad-spectrum combination of drug and natural antifungal. It is known that 
 <italic>T. rubrum</italic> exhibited a relatively higher production of virulence factors, such as keratinase and elastase, which can degrade the skin structural barrier and immune cells [

 <xref rid="B31-molecules-26-00461" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The synergy between drugs and essential oils could allow the use of lower doses of azoles in an effective and safe way, offering a promising use of this combination with TTO in the future pharmaceutical preparation for cutaneous mycoses management. In fact, some studies [

 <xref rid="B32-molecules-26-00461" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] showed that certain essentials oils and their components (
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic>, thymol, 
 <italic>C.copticum</italic>, and 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic>) are able to inhibit elastase in
