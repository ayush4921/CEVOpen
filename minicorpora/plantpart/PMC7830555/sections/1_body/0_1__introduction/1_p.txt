0: Dermatophytes are the most common fungal agents leading to superficial skin infections.
1: During the last century, their spread changed under the influence of several elements, such as socioeconomic factors, practices bound to life-style, increasing travel, and migration from southern to northern countries and vice versa [ 1].
2: Trichophyton rubrum, frequently causing  tinea pedis,  tinea unguium, and  tinea corporis, has increased steadily over this period and became the main agent isolated worldwide [ 2, 3, 4].
3: Over the past 2030 years,  T. rubrum has represented the most widespread dermatophyte in Central and North Europe with a prevalence accounting for about 70% of dermatophytosis.
4: This species is often the key etiological agent of chronic infections with a slow progression, suggesting that the fungus has adapted to the human host [ 5].
5: Sometimes it is responsible for a deeper and disseminated infection, particularly in immunocompromised patients [ 3].
