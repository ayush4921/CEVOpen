<p>In vitro susceptibility testing assays of TTO and its components or azoles on four 
 <italic>T. rubrum</italic> clinical isolates were performed using the CLSI M38-A2 broth microdilution method [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-26-00461" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], except for the inoculum suspensions [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-26-00461" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], with some modifications for TTO [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-26-00461" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. A volume of 100 μL of the inoculum suspension was transferred into microtiter plates containing 100 μL of two-fold serial dilutions of ITZ (range 0.0035–8 μg/mL), KTZ (range 0.0015–32 μg/mL), and TTO and/or components (range 0.006–4%), respectively. The RPMI 1640 medium alone and the RPMI-1640 containing DMSO were used as controls, with no inhibitory effect on fungal growth. ITZ and KTZ were used as reference drugs.
