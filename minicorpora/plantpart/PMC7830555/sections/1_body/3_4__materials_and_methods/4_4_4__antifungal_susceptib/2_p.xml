<p>Microdilution plates were set up and incubated at 28–30 °C for 7 days. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of azoles were determined visually as the lowest concentration of drug that produced a complete inhibition of growth relative to that of the growth control. MICs of TTO/components were read as the lowest concentration at which no fungal growth was observed. Minimum fungicidal concentrations (MFCs) were determined by spot inoculating 10 μL from wells with the inhibition of molds growth containing either azoles or TTO/components onto SDA plates, which were incubated at 35 °C for 72 h. The MFC was defined as the lowest concentration resulting in no growth on subculture [
