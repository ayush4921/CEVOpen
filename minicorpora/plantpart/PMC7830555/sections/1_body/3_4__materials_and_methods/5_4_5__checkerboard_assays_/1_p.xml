<p>Combinatorial effects between ITZ/KTZ and TTO were evaluated by the checkerboard broth microdilution assay. A two-dimensional checkerboard with serial two-fold dilutions of each compound, ranging from several dilutions below the MIC to 2 × MIC, was set up. Binary combinations were mixed in a 96-well microtitre plate. Cell suspensions were added to each well containing binary mixtures of azole drug/TTO. Each strain was tested in duplicate. Plates were incubated by shaking (150 rpm) at 28–30 °C for 7 days, and, afterwards, they were read visually. The results were analyzed using the fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) which was calculated as follows: FICI = FICa + FICb = MICa in combination/MICa tested alone + MICb in combination/MICb tested alone; where MICa and MICb are the MICs of azole and of the tested essential oil used alone. Synergy and antagonism were defined by FICI values of ≤0.5 and &gt;4, respectively. A FICI value between 0.5 and 1.0 was considered as additive, while a value between 1.0 and 4.0 was considered as indifferent [
