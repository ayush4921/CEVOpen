<p>Our data are in agreement with many studies that have demonstrated the synergistic or additive interactions of essential oils other than TTO with azoles, such as fluconazole and ketoconazole [

 <xref rid="B9-molecules-26-00461" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-26-00461" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. For example, Khan et al. reported synergistic interactions between oils of 
 <italic>Cinnamomum verum</italic>, 
 <italic>Syzygium aromaticum</italic>, 
 <italic>Cymbopogon martini</italic>, 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic>, and fluconazole against a multidrug resistant 
 <italic>T. rubrum</italic> strain [

 <xref rid="B23-molecules-26-00461" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Moreover, Pyun et al. [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-26-00461" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] observed significant synergistic antifungal activity when 
 <italic>Allium sativum</italic> oil was combined with ketoconazole [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-26-00461" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] against 
 <italic>Trichophyton</italic> spp. (
 <italic>T. rubrum</italic>, 
 <italic>T. erinacei</italic>, and 
 <italic>T. soudanense</italic>). The synergistic combination of TTO with azoles may be explained by the essential oil promoting the effects of antifungal drugs, mainly on the cell wall, plasma membrane, and other membrane structures of 
 <italic>T. rubrum</italic>. In addition, it could be possible that the fungicidal effect of TTO lowers the levels of the drug required to exert antifungal actions. The essential oils damaging the cell wall and cell membrane may facilitate the azolesâ€™ entry to the cell, leading to a greater effect on the ergosterol biosynthesis inhibition and adding to cell membrane destruction [
