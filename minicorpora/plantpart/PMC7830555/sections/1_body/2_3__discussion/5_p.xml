<p>TTO is composed of terpene hydrocarbons, in particular monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and associated alcohols. The International Standard Organization (ISO 4730:2017) regulates the concentration ranges of the major TTO terpenes, related alcohols, and ethers [

 <italic>T. rubrum</italic> could be ascribed to terpinen-4-ol, accounting for 35.88% in the essential oil (

 <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and 
 <italic>C. albicans.</italic> [

Hydrophobic terpenes strongly interact with the membrane lipids of pathogenic microorganisms, thus affecting the permeability of the membrane. These alterations may lead to the degradation of the cell wall, reduction in the adherence to host surfaces, disruption of the plasma membrane, loss of cell content, coagulation of cytoplasm, and cell lysis. Moreover, terpinen-4-ol is able to affect, like azoles, the ergosterol biosynthesis of 
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, leading to specific changes in gene expression [
