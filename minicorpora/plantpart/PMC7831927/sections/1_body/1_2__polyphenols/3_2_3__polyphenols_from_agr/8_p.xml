<p>By-products containing polyphenols are also generated from the production of soluble coffee. For example, coffee grounds, which is the principal by-product, contain many polyphenols such as condensed tannins [

Another by-product from this supply chain is the silverskin, a thin tegument covering coffee beans that is removed in the roasting process. Silverskin is rich in chlorogenic acid derivates such as dicaffeoylquinic acids and feruloylquinic acids [
