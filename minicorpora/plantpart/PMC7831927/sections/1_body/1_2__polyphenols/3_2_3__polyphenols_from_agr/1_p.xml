<p>Polyphenols being present in a wide spectrum of plant organs, they are easily found in numerous agro-industrial wastes/by-products, offering several possibilities for their valorization. First of all, an excellent polyphenol source is represented by the main by-products of wine production, namely: pomace, skins, and seeds. In particular, molasses seeds have a high flavonoids content, and molasses pomace is rich in tannins [
