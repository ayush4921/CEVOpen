<p>Regarding tannins, they are used in the veterinary field as anthelmintic and antimicrobial agents [

Moreover, although tannin-rich ingredients are often added to ruminants’ feed, there is still a lack of information about the interaction between hydrolysable tannins and ruminants’ gastrointestinal microbiota. The fate of hydrolysable tannin metabolites derived from gastrointestinal microbial activity in the animal is still underexplored. It is known that some metabolites derived from hydrolysable tannins (i.e., pyrogallol) have adverse effects on gastrointestinal microbiota and the host animal [
