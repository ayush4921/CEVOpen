<p>Flavonoids (C
 <sub>6</sub>-C
 <sub>3</sub>-C
 <sub>6</sub>) are generally constituted by two benzenic rings (A ring and B ring) linked by a chain made of three carbons, often condensed into a pyranic ring (C ring). Given their complexity, flavonoids are divided into other sub-classes such as: chalcones, dihydrochalcones, aurones, flavones, flavonols, dihydroflavonol, flavanones, flavanol, flavandiol or leucoanthocyanidin, anthocyanidin, isoflavonoids. Moreover, flavonoids exist in the aglycone form or as glycoside derivatives [
