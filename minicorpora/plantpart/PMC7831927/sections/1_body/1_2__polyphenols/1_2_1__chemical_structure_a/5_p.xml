<p>Tannins are high molecular weight polyphenols, usually distinct into condensed tannins (proanthocyanidins), which are polymers constituted by flavonoids units, and hydrolysable tannins characterized by a monosaccharide, normally D-glucose, esterified with one or more molecules of gallic acid (gallotannins), or ellagic acid (ellagitannins). Hydrolysable tannins are more labile in acid, alkali, or hot water than condensed tannins [
