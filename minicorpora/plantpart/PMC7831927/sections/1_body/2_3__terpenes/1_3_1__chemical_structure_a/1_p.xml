<p>Terpenes, also termed terpenoids or isoprenoids, constitute a large family of natural products extremely diversified in their structure, functions, and properties. Terpenes derive from mevalonic acid biosynthetic pathway. However, since their decomposition generates isoprene units (C
 <sub>5</sub>), this compound has been defined as terpeneâ€™s basic constituent. For this reason, these SMs are classified based on the number of isoprene units present in their structure, and generally condensed head-to-tail. Following this rule they are divided into hemiterpenes (C
 <sub>5</sub>H
 <sub>8</sub>), monoterpenes (C
 <sub>5</sub>H
 <sub>8</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>, sesquiterpenes (C
 <sub>5</sub>H
 <sub>8</sub>)
 <sub>3</sub>, diterpenes (C
 <sub>5</sub>H
 <sub>8</sub>)
 <sub>4</sub>, sesterterpenes (C
 <sub>5</sub>H
 <sub>8</sub>)
 <sub>5</sub>, triterpenes (C
 <sub>5</sub>H
 <sub>8</sub>)
 <sub>6</sub>, etc. [
