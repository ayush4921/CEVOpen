<p>Regarding diterpenes, more than one million tons a year [
 <xref rid="B147-molecules-26-00495" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>] of residue is produced after steam distillation of pine resin to recover the volatile fraction called turpentine. The consequent by-product is the gum rosin, which is a mixture of resin acids (90â€“95%) and other neutral compounds. The resin acids, most of which are isomers of each other, can be classified into two main categories: abietic-type (including abietic, neoabietic, palustric, and levopimaric), and pimaric-type (including pimaric, isopimaric, and sandaracopimaric) [
