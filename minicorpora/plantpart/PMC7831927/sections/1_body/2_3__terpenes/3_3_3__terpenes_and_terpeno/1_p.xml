<p>Due to their numerous bioactivities, terpenes are particularly interesting in the context of waste requalification. Monoterpenes such as thymol and carvacrol are still present in discrete amounts in several by-products derived both from essential oil distillation and from the harvesting of some aromatic plants. For instance, the solid waste residues left after the distillation of leaves and stems of Mexican oregano (
 <italic>Poliomintha longiflora</italic> A. Gray) contain thymol and carvacrol, and are, as a result, endowed with antimicrobial activity [
