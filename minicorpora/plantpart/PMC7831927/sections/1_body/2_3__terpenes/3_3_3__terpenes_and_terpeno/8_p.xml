<p>For example, oleanolic acid is found in agroforestry waste streams, such as in olive trees (
 <italic>Olea europaea</italic> L.), from which tons of wastes and by-products are generated on annual basis, including olive wood and leaves, cake, pomace, kernel, paste. During the production process, assuming a maximum content up to 3.1% of oleanolic acid in the leaves of 
 <italic>O. europaea</italic>, a large amount of this high-value compound can potentially be extracted, contributing to the integrated valorization of the olive oil production chain [
