<p>Several waste matrices contain saponins, which offer an enormous potential for their valorization. An example is provided by sisal (
 <italic>Agave sisalana</italic> Perrine), which is the main hard fiber produced worldwide. From its leaves, only the hard fibers (3–5% of total weight) are removed. The remaining 95–97% of the biomass is considered sisal waste, although it contains steroidal saponins, potentially useful for foods, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals formulations, as well as for soil bioremediation [
