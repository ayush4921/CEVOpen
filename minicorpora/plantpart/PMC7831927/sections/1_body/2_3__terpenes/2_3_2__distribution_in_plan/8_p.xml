<p>Moreover, saponins are antimicrobial agents active also against bacteria and fungi invading plants [

 <xref rid="B128-molecules-26-00495" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>]. The mechanism of these activities is likely based on saponins’ ability to form complexes with sterols present in the membrane of microorganisms and to cause, consequently, membrane perturbation [

 <xref rid="B134-molecules-26-00495" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>] found that saponin aescin, in addition to its antifungal effect against crop pathogens, is also able to activate plant immunity (in two different plant species) and to provide salicylic acid-dependent resistance against both fungal and bacterial pathogens.
