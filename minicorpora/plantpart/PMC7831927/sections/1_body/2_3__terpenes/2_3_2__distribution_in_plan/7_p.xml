<p>Moreover, saponins at low dosage also showed numerous biological activities important for human healthcare, which are summarized in several review papers [

 <xref rid="B117-molecules-26-00495" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]; most relevant among them are the anticancer, cholesterol-lowering, and antiviral properties [
