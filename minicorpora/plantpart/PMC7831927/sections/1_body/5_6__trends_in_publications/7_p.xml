 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00495-f006">Figure 6</xref>, the majority of plant wastes were valorized proposing potential exploitation in the area here called “human healthcare and food” (HHF) (including cosmetic, pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and food additive use). However, since plant SMs are endowed with a wide range of chemical and biological properties (as summarized in this review), it is expected that, following the actual trend, wastes and by-products of plant origin will be increasingly investigated also for their potential use in other areas of application, especially in agriculture, considering the need to implement “greener” practices in this sector.
