<p>Conversely, terpenes and alkaloids resulted as less investigated; in fact, they were mentioned as important compounds in only 12 and 7 plant species, respectively. In the context of waste valorization, the main bioactivity related to polyphenols was the in vitro antioxidant activity, which is common also to terpenes [
