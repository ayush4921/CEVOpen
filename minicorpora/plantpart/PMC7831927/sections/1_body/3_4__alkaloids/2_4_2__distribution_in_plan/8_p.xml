<p>Relevant in this context are also the alkaloids produced by the Solanaceae family, which have an enormous potential to deliver new chemicals for crop protection. In fact, more and more of these compounds, or mixtures of them, are being identified as pest control agents, especially against insects, fungi, and mites [
 <xref rid="B185-molecules-26-00495" ref-type="bibr">185</xref>]. The Solanaceae family belongs to the most important plant taxa, particularly in terms of food production (i.e., tomatoes and potatoes). Tomato and potato are the best known and most widely used plants of this group, and they constitutively synthesize low levels of many different glycoalkaloids. These natural toxicants (stress metabolites) have insecticidal and fungicidal properties and, since naturally occurring pesticides are often biosynthesized when plants are under stress, injuries on plant tissues promote the synthesis of higher concentrations of these compounds.
