<p>Another class of alkaloids, extremely relevant in view of waste valorization, is represented by glycoalkaloids, mainly produced by plants of the Solanaceae family. The major components of the glycoalkaloid family are α-solanine and α-chaconine found in potato plants (
 <italic>Solanum tuberosum</italic> L.), and solasonine and solamargine found in eggplants (
 <italic>Solanum melongena</italic> L.), whereas α-tomatine and dehydrotomatine are spirosolane-type glycoalkaloids found in tomato plants (
 <italic>Lycopersicon esculentum</italic> Mill.) [
