<p>Although the majority of the toxicity studies have been focused on tomatoes and potatoes due to the economic importance and availability of these species, acute toxicity to insects has also been reported in plant extracts belonging to other genera, such as

 <italic>Datura</italic>, and 
 <italic>Withania</italic> [

 <italic>Datura stramonium</italic> L. it is possible to extract a great variety of bioactive alkaloids, saponins, sterols, and polyphenols. This plant, as well as several other plants containing alkaloids, is often considered an agricultural waste [
