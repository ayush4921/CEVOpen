<p>A large number (more than 10,000 molecules) of plant SMs are classified as alkaloids [
 <xref rid="B158-molecules-26-00495" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>]. The presence of nitrogen in the structure is the peculiar chemical feature of alkaloids. However, due to the huge structural diversity, alkaloid classification is extremely challenging. More recent classifications are based on carbon skeletons and/or biochemical precursor. However, this requires compromises in borderline cases, for example, the alkaloid nicotine (from 
 <italic>Nicotiana</italic> spp.), which contains a pyridine fragment from nicotinamide and a pyrrolidine part from ornithine, could be correctly assigned to two different classes [
