<p>In particular, the majority of them derive from ornithine, leucine, lysine, tyrosine, tryptophan, histidine, and phenylalanine. More specifically, pyrrole alkaloids derive from leucine; pyrrolidine, tropane, and pyrrolizidine alkaloids from ornithine; quinolizidine, and indolizidine alkaloids derive from lysine; catecholamines, isoquinoline, tetrahydroisoquinoline, and benzyltetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloids originate from tyrosine; indolamines, indole, carboline, quinoline, pyrrolindole and ergot alkaloids come from tryptophan; and imidazole alkaloids from histidine.</p>
