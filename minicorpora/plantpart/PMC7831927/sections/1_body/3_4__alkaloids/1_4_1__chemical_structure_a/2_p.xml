<p>Historically, alkaloids have been defined as metabolites containing one or more nitrogen atom(s) within heterocyclic ring(s) [
 <xref rid="B159-molecules-26-00495" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>]. However, N-containing compounds where the N atom is not heterocyclic, such as hordenine, ephedrine, colchicine and capsaicin, were further included into this SM group and classified as proto-alkaloids or amino-alkaloids. For this reason heterocyclic N-containing compounds are often regarded as “true alkaloids.” Since “true alkaloids” biosynthetically derive from amino acids, they are classified on the basis of the biogenetic origin (
