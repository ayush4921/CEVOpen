<p>Sometimes the extraction can be facilitated by acidic or basic conditions under heating, as in the case of tannins, which can be extracted by maceration under reflux, using aqueous solvents, slightly alkaline at 85 Â°C. In particular, hydrolysable tannins are well extracted using a blend of 1% NaOH for 240 min, while condensed tannins are extracted with a blend of 1% Na
