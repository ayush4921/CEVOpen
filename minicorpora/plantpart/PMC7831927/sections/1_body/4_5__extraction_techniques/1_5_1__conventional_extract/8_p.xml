<p>ILs are ionic species (organic salts), fluids or solids at room temperature, consisting of an organic cation (i.e., ammonium, imidazolium, pyridinium, phosphonium) and an anion (i.e., bromide, chloride, tetrafluoroborate, hexafluorophosphate). Due to their ionic nature, ILs possess negligible vapor pressure and high solvation ability, and they offer a wide spectrum of extraction abilities and selectivity [

Moreover, recently, the possibility of using aqueous solutions of ILs instead of their pure forms led to a substantial improvement in their extraction efficiency and cost reduction. These solvents have already been used for the extraction of waste from natural products. For instance, solutions of surface-active ILs in water were used to efficiently extract triterpenic acids from apple peels [
