<p>Natural products are characterized by great diversity, which implies the necessity to develop specific extraction methods according to the starting raw material and selected metabolite(s). Generally, the raw matrix is subjected to an air drying process, dried in an oven or freeze-dried, and subsequently ground to create a homogeneous sample before the extraction [
