<p>Natural deep eutectic solvents (NADES) are considered as a specific class of liquids present in living cells, where they play an important role in biosynthesis, transport, and storage of compounds with intermediate polarity [
 <xref rid="B206-molecules-26-00495" ref-type="bibr">206</xref>]. NADES are composed of hydrogen bond donors (HBDs) and hydrogen bond acceptors (HBAs) mixed together. The usual HBAs are nontoxic quaternary ammonium salts or amino acids, while HBDs are organic acids or carbohydrates. Alcohol, amine, aldehyde, ketone, and carboxylic groups can be used as both HBAs and HBDs. There are a huge number of natural metabolites, which can be combined to prepare NADES, making the latter a high versatility tailor-made class of solvents. NADES have numerous favorable properties, they are liquid state within a wide temperature range, manifest chemical and thermal stability, are non-flammable and non-volatile, nontoxic as well as having sustainable “green” properties. On this basis, NADES have been used to extract a wide range of natural compounds, including phenolics, alkaloids, saponins, anthraquinones, terpenoids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and photosynthetic pigments [

Regarding the employment of NADES in the extraction of plant-driven industrial wastes, they have been used to efficiently obtain phenols from by-products of the olive oil industry, and the onion, tomato, potato, orange, and pear canning industries [
