<p>Microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) reduces extraction time with a minor consumption of solvents and minimum degradation of target compounds. It is based on microwave energy, which heats the solvents and increases the internal pressure inside the cell, helping the disruption of the cellular wall and the release of active compounds to the solvent [
