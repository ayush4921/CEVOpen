<p>Supercritical fluid technology (SFT) is based on supercritical fluids, among them the most used is supercritical carbon dioxide (CO
 <sub>2</sub>), generated by increasing the pressure and the temperature of the liquid/gas above the critical point. These fluids have liquid-like solvent power and gas-like diffusivity, resulting optimal to extract compounds from plant matrices, and yield solvent-free extracts by the reduction of CO
 <sub>2</sub> pressure, which allows to easily remove it. This technique has been extensively applied to extract plant metabolites from waste. For instance, STF was used to efficiently extract tocopherols and carotenoids rich oil guava seeds, which are endowed with good antioxidant activity [
