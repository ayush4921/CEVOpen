<p>Different extraction methods have been proposed in order to shorten, improve, and obtain greener procedures for natural metabolite extraction. Several works have been dedicated to summarize these techniques and their use to extract bioactive metabolites from natural wastes [

 <xref rid="B212-molecules-26-00495" ref-type="bibr">212</xref>]. Ultrasonic-assisted extraction (UAE) is an effective extraction technique for a wide range of compounds from different types of matrices. Due to the cavitational effects leading to cell wall disruption the release of the target compound(s) from the biomass is favored [
