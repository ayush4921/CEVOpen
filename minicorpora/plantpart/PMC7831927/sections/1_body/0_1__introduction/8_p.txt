0: Interestingly, SMs are potentially present in all plant organs, offering several possibilities for the valorization of wastes from plant cultivation.
1: In fact, in the agricultural sector, only a few plant organs are harvested and fully consumed, generating numerous wastes at different levels of the supply chain.
2: In this context, scientific investigations aimed at identifying the bioactive compounds contained in these neglected matrices play a pivotal role in laying the basis for their valorization.
