0: In this scenario, the idea of circular economy took shape, promoting the shift from a linear economic scheme of take-make-use-dispose to a circular model, employing reuse, sharing, repair, refurbishment, remanufacturing, and recycling to create a closed-loop system, attempting to minimize the use of resource inputs and the generation of waste, pollution, and carbon emissions [ 9, 10].
1: In Europe, the most relevant strategy launched in order to attain a sustainable development is the Circular Economy Action Plan, according to which waste materials and energy become input for other industrial processes or regenerative resources for nature (i.e., compost) [ 11].
2: In order to facilitate and stimulate the implementation of these guidelines, the scientific community is paying increasing attention to the valorization of industrial and agricultural wastes and by-products, in particular, those derived from plants.
3: These neglected matrices are often manufactured for biofuel production, such as methane or ethanol [ 12].
4: However, according to the proposed waste hierarchy ( Figure 1), energy recovery is a less preferable strategy of waste management, compared to others.
5: Moreover, although biofuel is an alternative to petroleum-derived fuels, its sustainability is quite controversial [ 13, 14].
