<p>Aimed at facilitating and encouraging research projects focused on plant wastes/by-products and circular economy implementation, the current review provides an overview of the most common SMs present in plant matrices, their classification and bioactivities, and the consequent potential application in different fields of the waste material containing these compounds. Consequently, in this work 99 publications (from 2006 to 2020) focused on plant waste/by-product valorization were reviewed and tabulated in order to schematize the state of the art on this topic and offer the opportunity to easily extrapolate information for the design of new studies on neglected plant material and its reuse in a circular economy perspective.</p>
