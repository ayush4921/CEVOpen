Moreover, food waste and overproduction imply unnecessary exploitation of the environment and natural resources such as carbon, water, and land. The land footprint estimated by the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations) in 2013 [

Furthermore, food overproduction and bad waste management also have a negative impact on the economy, with money loss at different levels of the supply chain. Conversely, the reduction of food loss and waste generation has the potential to generate considerable economic value.
