<p>Actually, the high added-value molecules still contained in plant wastes and by-products offer a wide spectrum of possibilities for their valorization and reuse, as foreseen by circular economy [

 <xref rid="B16-molecules-26-00495" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. For example, from agri-food wastes it is still possible to extract macromolecules such as nucleic acids [

 <xref rid="B20-molecules-26-00495" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Primary metabolites (i.e., organic acids, amino acids, carbohydrates) can also be obtained from plant waste material and used for different purposes [

Plants in particular produce secondary metabolites (SMs), which are not directly involved in the basic functions of growth, development, and reproduction of the organism, but are essential for long-term survival and play multiple roles, including defense against predators or attraction of pollinators [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-26-00495" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. SMs are endowed with numerous biological activities, making them also extremely important for human health and well-being. Moreover, due to their chemical and biological properties, SMs have also found application in many other fields, serving as pigments, cosmetics, antifeedants and so on [
