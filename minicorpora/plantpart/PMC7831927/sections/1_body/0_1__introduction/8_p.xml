<p>Interestingly, SMs are potentially present in all plant organs, offering several possibilities for the valorization of wastes from plant cultivation. In fact, in the agricultural sector, only a few plant organs are harvested and fully consumed, generating numerous wastes at different levels of the supply chain. In this context, scientific investigations aimed at identifying the bioactive compounds contained in these neglected matrices play a pivotal role in laying the basis for their valorization.</p>
