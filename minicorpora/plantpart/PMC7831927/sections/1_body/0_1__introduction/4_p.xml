<p>In this scenario, the idea of circular economy took shape, promoting the shift from a linear economic scheme of “take-make-use-dispose” to a circular model, employing reuse, sharing, repair, refurbishment, remanufacturing, and recycling to create a closed-loop system, attempting to minimize the use of resource inputs and the generation of waste, pollution, and carbon emissions [

In Europe, the most relevant strategy launched in order to attain a sustainable development is the Circular Economy Action Plan, according to which waste materials and energy become input for other industrial processes or regenerative resources for nature (i.e., compost) [

In order to facilitate and stimulate the implementation of these guidelines, the scientific community is paying increasing attention to the valorization of industrial and agricultural wastes and by-products, in particular, those derived from plants. These neglected matrices are often manufactured for biofuel production, such as methane or ethanol [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00495-f001">Figure 1</xref>), energy recovery is a less preferable strategy of waste management, compared to others. Moreover, although biofuel is an alternative to petroleum-derived fuels, its sustainability is quite controversial [
