0: Actually, the high added-value molecules still contained in plant wastes and by-products offer a wide spectrum of possibilities for their valorization and reuse, as foreseen by circular economy [ 15, 16].
1: For example, from agri-food wastes it is still possible to extract macromolecules such as nucleic acids [ 17], pectins [ 18], cellulose material [ 19], and enzymes such as bromelain, which is derived from pineapple residues and extensively used as a pharmaceutical and meat tenderizer [ 20].
2: Primary metabolites (i.e., organic acids, amino acids, carbohydrates) can also be obtained from plant waste material and used for different purposes [ 21].
3: Plants in particular produce secondary metabolites (SMs), which are not directly involved in the basic functions of growth, development, and reproduction of the organism, but are essential for long-term survival and play multiple roles, including defense against predators or attraction of pollinators [ 22].
4: SMs are endowed with numerous biological activities, making them also extremely important for human health and well-being.
5: Moreover, due to their chemical and biological properties, SMs have also found application in many other fields, serving as pigments, cosmetics, antifeedants and so on [ 23].
