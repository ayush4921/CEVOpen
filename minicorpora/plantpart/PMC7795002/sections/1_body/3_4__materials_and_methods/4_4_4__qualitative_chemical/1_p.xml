<p>The GC-MS analyses on DB-5ms were carried out under the following conditions: carrier gas: helium, constant flow rate: 1 mL/min; injection volume: 1 μL, injection mode: split (ratio of 40:1), injection temperature: 250 °C; temperature program: from 50 °C (1 min) to 250 °C (10 min) at 3 °C/min. Analyses on the HP-INNOWax column were carried out under the same conditions as for DB-5ms, only the final oven temperature was set at 230 °C.</p>
