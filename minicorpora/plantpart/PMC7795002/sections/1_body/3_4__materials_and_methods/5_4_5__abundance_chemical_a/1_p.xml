<p>The abundance analyses were carried out under the same instrumental conditions as those adopted above, with the exception of the temperature program: from 50 °C (1 min) to 180 °C at the rate of 3 °C/min, then 15 °C/min until 250 °C (15 min) for DB-5ms and 230 °C (15 min) for HP-INNOWax. FID conditions: hydrogen flowrate 30 mL/min, air flow 300 mL/min, temperature: 250 °C. The abundance composition was obtained by using relative response factors, calculated on the basis of the combustion enthalpy [

Isopropyl caproate was obtained by synthesis in one of the authors’ laboratory (G.G.) and its purity was 97% by GC. Furthermore, a calibration curve was constructed for each column. Six calibration standard dilutions were taken to build-up the calibration curves, corresponding to 0.6, 1.8, 4.3, 8.3, 16.8 and 34.3 mg of isopropyl caproate in 10 mL of cyclohexane, respectively. Nonane (7.0 mg) was used as internal standard. The calibration curves generated a correlation coefficient of 0.999 for both columns.
