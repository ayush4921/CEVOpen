<p>Five analytical hydrodistillations were performed on the fresh aerial parts of each botanical specimen. These processes were carried out with a glass laboratory-scale Marcusson apparatus, with recycling of the lower phase. During each analytical distillation, seventeen grams of fresh plant material were hydrodistilled for 90 min and the essential oil collected in 500 Î¼L of an extraction layer of cyclohexane, containing
