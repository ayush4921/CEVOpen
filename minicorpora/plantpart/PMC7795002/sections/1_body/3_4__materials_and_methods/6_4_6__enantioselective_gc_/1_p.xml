<p>The enantioselective GC-MS analysis was performed with a temperature program from 50 °C (5 min) to 220 °C (5 min) at 2 °C/min. The elution order was established by injecting, in the same instrumental conditions, mixtures of enantiomerically pure standards, available in one of the authors’ laboratory (C.B.).</p>
