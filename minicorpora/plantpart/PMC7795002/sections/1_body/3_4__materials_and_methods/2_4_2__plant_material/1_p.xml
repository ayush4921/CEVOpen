<p>The aerial parts of 
 <italic>C. taxifolium</italic> were collected on 24 May 2018 in the province of Loja, mount Villonaco, at an altitude of 2724 m above sea level. The geographic point was located at coordinates 004°00’00” S–079°17’00” W. In order to grant a statistically representative number of samples, five different specimens were collected within a radius of 500 m from these coordinates. The plant was collected with the permission of the Ministry of Environment of Ecuador (MAE-DNB-CN-2016-0048) and the specimens were identified by one of the authors (N.C.). A voucher specimen was also deposited inside the Universidad Técnica Particular de Loja herbarium (herbarium code: HUTPL), with the identification code VMZ_010. To ensure the correct botanical identification, both the current and the previous specimens (voucher n. PPN-la-101) were compared with an original sample from the herbarium of the Universidad Nacional de Loja (herbarium code: LOJA), with all showing morphologically identical results.
