<p>The activities against cholinesterase (ChE) were evaluated by a colorimetric protocol, adapted from Ellman et al. [
 <xref rid="B72-molecules-26-00045" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. The catalyst efficiently hydrolyzes acetylthiocholine (ATCh), the sulphur analogue of the natural substrate of these enzymes. After hydrolysis, this substrate analogue produces acetate ion and thiocoline. Thiocoline, in the presence of the highly reactive dithiobisnitrobenzoate ion (DTNB), produces a yellow color, which can be monitored quantitatively by its spectrophotometric absorption at 412 nm. The inhibition assay volume contained 200 μL of phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4), DNTB (1.5 mM) and test sample in DMSO (1%

 <italic>Electrophorus electricus</italic> acetylcholinesterase and equine serum butyrylcholinesterase were dissolved in PBS pH 7.4 and were used at 25 mU/mL for the assay. After 10 min of preincubation, the substrate acetylthiocholine iodide (1.5 mM) was added to start the reaction. During the incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, multiple 96-well microliter sites were read in a Varioskan Flash detection system. All measurements were run in triplicate. When possible, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were calculated using the GNUPLOT package online (

 <sub>50</sub> = 100 nM for AChE and 8500 nM for BChE. In this assay, the possibility of false positive inhibition results, previously described for high concentration (&gt;100 μg/mL) of amine or aldehyde compounds, cannot be excluded [
