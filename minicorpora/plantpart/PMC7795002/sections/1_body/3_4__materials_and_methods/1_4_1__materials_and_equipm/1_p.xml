<p>The chemical analyses were run by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), with a 6890N GC unit from Agilent Technologies, coupled with a quadrupole Mass Spectrometry Detector (MSD) 5973 (Santa Clara, CA, USA). The MSD was operated with an electronic ionization (70 eV) source, in scan mode, with a mass range detection of 35–350

The analyses were carried out with a non-polar DB-5ms capillary column (5%-phenyl-methylpolysiloxane, 30 m length, 0.25 mm internal diameter and 0.25 μm film thickness; J &amp; W Scientific, Folsom, CA, USA) and a polar HP-INNOWax column (polyethylene glycol, 30 m length, 0.25 mm internal diameter and 0.25 μm film thickness; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA).
