<p>The aerial parts of the native Andean species 
 <italic>Clinopodium taxifolium</italic> (Kunth) Govaerts (Lamiaceae) give an EO mainly consisting of sesquiterpenes and sesquiterpenoids. Although rather uncommon, the composition based on sesquiterpenoids has already been described for other species belonging to 
 <italic>Clinopodium</italic> genus. In this case, it indicates the existence of at least two chemical profiles for 
 <italic>C. taxifolium.</italic> This EO is characterized by a selective inhibition activity versus the enzyme BChE. The interest in a selective inhibitor is justified by the relative overexpression of this enzyme in the advanced progression of the AD. The search for this kind of inhibitor, over the last 20 years, testifies to the importance of this matter in pharmaceutical research. However, in our case, the relatively small size and the aliphatic structure of the molecules suggest a possible synergic mechanism instead of the presence of a single inhibitor in the mixture. This problem is possibly the main item to be investigated for this EO in future research.
