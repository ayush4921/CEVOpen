0: According to the UN Environment Program World Conservation Monitoring Centre [ 1], Ecuador belongs to the group of the 17 megadiverse countries in the world, making it an extraordinary reservoir of biodiversity.
1: As a megadiverse country, it must possess at least 5000 of the worlds plants as endemics [ 1].
2: Most of the botanical species described in Ecuador have never been studied so far from a phytochemical point of view; this makes the country an unbelievable source of potentially new chemical structures and biologically active compounds.
3: In 2016, two of us (J.R. and G.G.)
4: reported that about 50% of all the phytochemical publications on the Ecuadorian flora referred only to 8 of the 245 botanical families of the native species known in the country [ 2].
5: For this reason, the authors have been involved for years in the description of specialized (secondary) metabolites contained in the Ecuadorian flora, to contribute to the advance in its phytochemical and phytopharmaceutical knowledge [ 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].
6: Within a project focused on the description of new essential oils (EOs) [ 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20], the aim of this study is to describe a novel chemical profile of an already known EO, distilled from the aerial parts of  Clinopodium taxifolium (Kunth) Govaerts.
7: Clinopodium taxifolium (Kunth) Govaerts is a species belonging to the family Lamiaceae, also known with many synonyms, such as  Gardoquia taxifolia Kunth,  Satureja andrei Epling,  Satureja taxifolia (Kunth) Briq.,  Gardoquia glabrata Kunth,  Thymus taxifolius Willd.
8: ex Benth,  Satureja glabrata (Kunth) Briq.,  Satureja taxifolia (Kunth) Briq.
9: and  Satureja lineata Epling.
10: [ 10, 21, 22, 23].
11: This plant is also known with the homonym  Clinopodium taxifolium (Kunth) Harley [ 21].
12: The species is native of the Andean region of Ecuador [ 23], where it has been described in the provinces of Azuay, Oro y Loja.
13: However, specimens have also been described in Bolivia and Peru [ 21].
14: This plant grows at an altitude of 15003000 m above sea level [ 23] and it is known as  Culantrillo de Cerro or  Polea de Castilla [ 10].
15: Furthermore,  C. taxifolium is used by infusion in folk medicine for treating internal inflammations, flatulence, stomach pain, malaria and cough [ 10].
16: In 2018, one of the authors (G.G.)
17: first published the composition of an EO from this species as a part of a phytochemical study [ 10].
18: Afterwards, the authors studied the composition of the EO of a different sample of  C. taxifolium of different origin, obtaining very different quali-quantitative and general sensory results, compared to that described in 2018.
19: The EO was therefore re-investigated on a statistically significant number of samples, rigorously identified from the botanic point of view and submitted to new biological essays.
