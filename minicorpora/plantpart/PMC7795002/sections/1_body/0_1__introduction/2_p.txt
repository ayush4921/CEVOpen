0: The inhibition activity of a cholinesterase (ChE) was here investigated, within a project focused on the identification of plant specialized metabolites active against Alzheimers disease (AD).
1: AD is a chronic neurodegenerative illness, characterized by a progressive deterioration of memory and cognitive functions.
2: According to the World Health Organization (WHO), AD is currently the first cause of dementia in the world, being responsible for 6070% of cases [ 24].
3: The universal interest in finding new anti-AD drugs is due to the rapid diffusion of this illness in western countries, mainly as a consequence of the increase in life expectancy.
4: The 2016 World Alzheimers Report indicated that 47 million people live with dementia worldwide, and this number is expected to increase to more than 131 million by the year 2050.
5: The disease is due to the accumulation of anomalous protein fragments (amyloid   peptides and hyper-phosphorylated tau proteins) into the brain.
6: Several hypotheses try to explain this phenomenon, the most important of them being the so-called cholinergic hypothesis Accordingly, the cognitive degradation is due to the destruction of cholinergic neurons and the consequent ChE depletion, which can be counteracted by inhibiting the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) enzymes [ 24].
7: The administration of ChE inhibitors has been shown to produce an increase in the levels of acetylcholine (ACh) in the brain [ 25, 26], counteracting the progress of the symptoms.
8: The present discussion on the effectiveness and availability of drugs to treat AD [ 27, 28], is the basis for the investigation of natural products in this field [ 26].
