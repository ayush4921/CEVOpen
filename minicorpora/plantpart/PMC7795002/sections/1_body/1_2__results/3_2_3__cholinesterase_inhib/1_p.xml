<p>The inhibitory activity of 
 <italic>C. taxifolium</italic> EO against BChE showed an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 31.3 ± 3.0 μg/mL; however, it was shown to be inactive against AChE (IC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 250 μg/mL) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00045-f002">Figure 2</xref>). These results were compared to the ones of donepezil as positive control, which showed an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of about one order of magnitude less against BChE.
