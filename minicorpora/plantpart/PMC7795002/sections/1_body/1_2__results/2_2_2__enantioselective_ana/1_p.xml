<p>The enantioselective analysis was carried out on a 30% diethyl-
 <italic>tert</italic>-butyldimethylsilyl-
 <italic>Î²</italic>-cyclodextrin in a PS-086 capillary column. A total of nine chiral components were identified, eight of them were monoterpenoids and one a sesquiterpene hydrocarbon. None of the detected chiral compounds were enantiomerically pure. The results of the enantioselective analysis are reported in
