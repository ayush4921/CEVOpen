<p>The EO was obtained in a quite low yield (0.07 ± 0.02%) from fresh plant material. A total of 37 compounds were detected, of which 32 with a non-polar Gas Chromatography (GC) column and 36 on a polar column. Most of the detected constituents were identified according to the corresponding Electron Ionization Mass Spectrum (EIMS) and Linear Retention Index (LRI). Two sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (204 amu) and one sesquiterpene alcohol (220 amu) could not be identified (unknown). The component abundance, here reported for both GC on non-polar (first value) and polar columns (second value), was measured by normalized percent abundance. The abundance of a total of 34 components was determined with at least one column, obtaining values corresponding to 88.1% and 86.0% of the whole sample, respectively, with a detection threshold fixed at 0.1%. The chemical analysis showed that this EO mainly consisted of sesquiterpenes and sesquiterpenoids (more than 70%), the main ones being (E)-
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene (17.8–14.5%), 
 <italic>α</italic>-copaene (10.5–8.0%), 
 <italic>β</italic>-bourbonene (9.9–8.2%), 
 <italic>δ</italic>-cadinene (6.6–5.4%), cis-cadina-1(6),4-diene (6.4–0.2%) and germacrene D (4.9–4.9%). The full chemical composition is reported in
