Fish leftovers and their processing byproducts represent a significant portion of the original fish, and their disposal has a high environmental and economic impact. The utilization of waste as raw materials for the production of different classes of biofuels and high-value chemicals, a concept known as &#x0201c;biorefinery&#x0201d;, is gaining interest in a vision of circular economy and zero waste policies. In this context, an interesting route of valorization is the extraction of omega-3 fatty acids (&#x003c9;-3 FAs) for nutraceutical application. These fatty acids, such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) have received attention over the last decades due to their beneficial effects on human health. Their sustainable production is a key process for matching the increased market demand while reducing the pressure on marine ecosystems and lowering the impact of waste production. The high resale value of the products makes this waste a powerful tool that simultaneously protects the environment and benefits the global economy. This review aims to provide a complete overview of the sustainable exploitation of fish waste to recover &#x003c9;-3 FAs for food supplement applications, covering composition, storage, and processing of the raw material.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>omega-3</kwd><kwd>fish waste</kwd><kwd>supplements</kwd><kwd>fish oil extraction</kwd><kwd>PUFA</kwd><kwd>EPA</kwd><kwd>DHA</kwd><kwd>supercritical fluid extraction</kwd><kwd>biorefinery</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-molecules-26-01002"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Food of both plant and animal origins represents a considerable source of compounds relevant for human health. Bioactive substances can also be recovered from waste and byproducts of the food supply chain thus contributing to the implementation of sustainable practices in waste management [<xref rid="B1-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>According to a commonly accepted hierarchy of solutions in waste management, the prevention of waste generation should be the primary solution to be implemented. Alternative actions to be taken include the exploitation of waste for the retrieval of added-value products, an extremely attractive possibility both from an environmental and economic point of view. The actions fit into the overall definition of &#x0201c;biorefinery&#x0201d;, which is the sustainable conversion of biomass into energy and other biobased products [<xref rid="B2-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Even if data on food waste amounts are somehow affected by the lack of a generally accepted definition of what is considered &#x0201c;waste&#x0201d;, it is estimated that around one-third of food is discarded [<xref rid="B2-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>A considerable contribution to global waste is constituted by fish leftovers and processing byproducts that represent from 20 to 80% of the original fish and include a wide range of materials like damaged whole fish, and non-edible parts like viscera or skin [<xref rid="B4-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. All these discarded materials have attracted attention over the last decades, triggering researchers to develop methods to process them into useful products, making the most of their biochemical heterogeneity: lipids, proteins (or their hydrolysates), and polysaccharides are just some of the molecules that can be obtained.</p><p>Common applications of fish leftovers include but are not limited to animal feed, production of energy through biodiesel and biogas, natural pigments (e.g., astaxanthin or &#x003b2;carotene), soil fertilizers, food packaging, and enzyme isolation [<xref rid="B6-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Recovery of marketable byproducts from fishery waste represents a paramount strategy to reduce disposal costs, benefit the environment, and generate additional revenue. Additionally, the recovery of fish oil from waste may diminish the pressure of industrial fishing on fish stocks [<xref rid="B8-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In this frame, an interesting route to the valorization of rest raw materials and waste is the isolation of &#x003c9;3- FAs such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6&#x003c9;-3) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5&#x003c9;-3), which are widely distributed in marine sources like fish and other seafood.</p><p>EPA and/or DHA are claimed to have a preventive role in the development and progression of a broad range of conditions, including cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), neurological diseases, infant development, and cancer [<xref rid="B9-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Despite evidence for &#x003c9;-3 FAs effectiveness is not always conclusive, their benefits are reported also based on some randomized clinical trials, and the interest in their protective role is considerable [<xref rid="B9-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Fish consumption should be preferred to &#x003c9;-3 FAs supplements because it provides beneficial nutrients not contained in fish oil. Nevertheless, when sufficient intake is impossible, supplementation is reasonable and sometimes recommended [<xref rid="B12-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Traditional sources of &#x003c9;3-FAs are wild and aquacultured fish but, due to the increased demand, the need for alternative and compatible sources is dramatic [<xref rid="B8-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Projections show that in 2025 fish oil for human consumption will reach 771,000 tons [<xref rid="B13-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>In accordance with the circular economy and the zero-waste concepts [<xref rid="B14-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], not only is a sustainable extraction and purification of &#x003c9;-3 FAs from fish waste desirable, but it should be strongly encouraged since all the byproducts of the process can be turned into valorized products: protein moiety as animal feed and source for enzymes and bioactive peptides, glycerol for the production of valuable chemicals short-chain unsaturated fatty acids (FAs) as liquid biofuel, fish bones as a source of minerals, collagen, and gelatin [<xref rid="B7-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B15-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Waste valorization should be carried out minimizing the environmental impact, by ensuring that the whole process of recovery provokes a lower impact than other waste management practices.</p><p>In this review, several issues affecting the production of &#x003c9;-3 FAs supplements from fish waste material will be discussed, including waste composition, storage, and processing, focusing on the sustainability of the processes and providing a basic overview of the potentialities of supercritical fluids in different steps of the supplement production. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review covering the whole process from waste to &#x003c9;-3 FAs formulations for supplement applications. The main aim is to provide the interested reader with a wide and complete overview of the topic and to improve the sustainable exploitation of this valuable resource.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-molecules-26-01002"><title>2. Lipid Content in Fish Oil</title><p>Lipids are mainly present in fish oil as triacylglycerols (TAGs), fatty acid esters of glycerol. Glycerol carbon atoms are numbered according to a stereochemical system, positions sn-1 and sn-3 being the outers, position sn-2 the central one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-01002-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Considering that FAs can be differently arranged in TAGs, if n is the number of different FAs in a TAG, n<sup>3</sup> different molecules (including enantiomers) are possible, giving each oil its unique and complex composition [<xref rid="B16-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. A minor number of FAs occurs as phospholipids, amphipathic molecules containing polar head groups linked to the glycerol moiety via phosphate linkage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-01002-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Examples of polar head groups are choline, ethanolamine, and inositol [<xref rid="B17-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Different classes of FAs are present in lipids: saturated FAs (SFAs), monounsaturated FAs (MFAs, containing one C-C double bond), and polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs, containing more than one C-C double bonds). Most natural unsaturated fatty acids&#x02019; double bonds show a <italic>cis</italic> configuration that confers them a kinked shape and impairs the lipid packing, resulting in lower melting points and increased membrane fluidity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-01002-f002">Figure 2</xref>). FAs are classed according to the position of the first double bond counting from the terminal omega (&#x003c9;) carbon: &#x003c9;-3 FAs have the first double bond on carbon 3 while &#x003c9;-6 FAs have the first double bond on carbon 6 [<xref rid="B13-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B15-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Broadly speaking, the lipid composition of fish widely varies according to geographic location, type of water (marine or freshwater), feed, season, and maturity of the fish [<xref rid="B18-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Additional differences may be caused by post-capture handling and processing. Food availability is a major determinant of fish fatty acids composition since fish are not able to produce &#x003c9;-3 FAs but accumulate them from algae, plankton, and prey fish [<xref rid="B8-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Accordingly, EPA and DHA content is higher in marine fish than in freshwater fish because marine plankton presents a high level of &#x003c9;-3 PUFAs [<xref rid="B19-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Farmed fish may be characterized by a higher content of DHA and EPA depending on their feed (typically fishmeal or fish oil) [<xref rid="B8-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In spring and summer food is usually more available than in other seasons so fat storage increases [<xref rid="B18-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Membrane and storage lipid composition also varies with thermal changes: cold is usually associated with an increase in unsaturation to maintain membrane fluidity and functionality at low temperature [<xref rid="B8-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B21-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Finally, sexual maturity also affects lipid content that decreases during the spawning period due to the higher consumption of fat reserves [<xref rid="B18-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>All these factors must be taken into account when choosing a waste source for extraction of &#x003c9;-3 fatty acids and explain why data on fish FAs composition are not always similar [<xref rid="B19-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. For example, considering the fatty acid profiles of thirteen different seafood species caught in the Northeastern Mediterranean coast, SFAs range from 27.68 to 36.59%, MUFAs from 8.99 to 35.84%, and PUFAs from 10.69 to 39.57%. FAs typically detected are myristic acid (C14:0), palmitic acid (C16:0), palmitoleic acid (C16:1&#x003c9;7) heptadecanoic acid (C17:0), stearic acid (C18:0), vaccenic acid (C18:1&#x003c9;-7), oleic acid (C18:1&#x003c9;-9), linoleic acid (C18:2&#x003c9;-6), arachidonic acid (C20:4&#x003c9;-6), cis-5,8,11,14,17-EPA (C20:5&#x003c9;-3) and cis-4,7,10,13,16,19-DHA (C22:6&#x003c9;-3) [<xref rid="B22-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Fish oil can contain up to ca. 50% of omega-3 PUFAs, with EPA and DHA accounting from 5 to 26 w/w% of total FAs [<xref rid="B20-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B23-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Fish lipids are currently being extracted from a wide range of species, including cod, herring, mackerel, tuna, salmon, anchovy, menhaden, and sardine [<xref rid="B16-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Byproducts availability varies within species and processing methods, but usually includes viscera, skin, heads, bones, and fins. The oil distribution in the tissues is usually heterogeneous. For example, mackerel&#x02019;s skin, which is usually discarded during processing, has a higher content of PUFAs if compared with viscera and muscle [<xref rid="B20-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Livers and viscera of little tuna (<italic>Euthynnus alletteratus</italic>) contain a higher lipid amount than the other organs [<xref rid="B21-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Tuna heads are a common raw material but their cooking yields a dark and malodorous oil, which requires several refinery processes [<xref rid="B24-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Tuna eyeballs that are separated from tuna heads before cooking could render higher quality fish oil rich in &#x003c9;-3 FAs (32.72% DHA and 7.07% EPA, with respect to total PUFAs) reducing the number of steps in the refinery process [<xref rid="B24-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Knowing the composition of raw material is essential to optimize extraction and purification processes in terms of yields and quality of the oil. However, consideration should be given not only to fatty acid content but also to local availability.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-molecules-26-01002"><title>3. Omega-3 Fatty Acids and Health</title><p>DHA and EPA are produced by krill and fish through bioconversion of FAs accumulated by consuming zooplankton (fish and krill) or phytoplankton (krill) [<xref rid="B26-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>EPA and DHA can also be produced by the human body converting &#x003b1;-linoleic acid (ALA), an essential FA that must be obtained from other organisms that can synthesize it, typically plants. However, due to low conversion efficiency, food intake is the principal way to increase their level in the human body. After absorption, PUFAs are incorporated at a cellular level into triglycerides, phospholipids, and cholesterol esters [<xref rid="B14-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Omega-3 FAs play both a structural role as components of cell membranes (regulating their architecture and permeability) and a metabolic role (providing energy for the body). Moreover, they are used to produce eicosanoids, oxygenated metabolites involved in many cell-signaling pathways regulating the modulation of cardiovascular, pulmonary, reproductive, immune, and endocrine systems. Some examples are prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and leukotrienes [<xref rid="B17-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The &#x003c9;-6/&#x003c9;-3 fatty acids ratio also seems to have important implications for the development of some chronic diseases but the optimum relative intake is not still clear.</p><p>The potential health benefits of &#x003c9;-FAs consumption are related to a wide range of pathologies, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), infant neurodevelopment, cancer, Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease, cognitive function, rheumatoid arthritis, depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and some eyes conditions like age-related macular degeneration, and dry eyes [<xref rid="B10-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B27-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>These observations stem from numerous observational and prospective studies. However, caution must be exercised when trying to undoubtedly correlate a benefit to a specific bioactive compound (in this case, &#x003c9;-3 FAs in seafood). Other aspects should be taken into account, including the presence of other nutrients, the substitution of seafood for other less healthy foods, a better social status, or a health-conscious lifestyle. Besides, a combination of different factors cannot be ruled out. The availability of data from randomized clinical data is essential but unfortunately these data are often conflicting and not conclusive. This may be ascribed not only to the different doses used in different studies but also to differences in population, diet, therapies, or statistical analysis. For example, some prospective studies relate a higher intake of omega-&#x003c9;-3 fatty acids with a lower risk of breast and colorectal cancer, but genetic risk and gender seem to play an important role requiring additional research [<xref rid="B35-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>Maybe the more controversial subject is the relationship between &#x003c9;-3 FAs intake and CVDs, disorders of the heart and blood vessels, which include coronary heart and cerebrovascular disease [<xref rid="B9-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B37-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>Some observational studies correlate higher dietary or plasma levels of &#x003c9;-3s FAs with a lower risk of CVDs [<xref rid="B37-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B39-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Looking at some clinical trials data from 1968 to 2019 [<xref rid="B9-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], EPA and DHA are reported to induce a slight but significant reduction in serum triglyceride levels, rate of cardiovascular mortality, and rate of coronary heart disease events [<xref rid="B9-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B38-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], but results are often conflicting with the omega-3s sometimes not provoking any significant effects [<xref rid="B40-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>Overall, since evidence exists that EPA and DHA have a positive effect on serum triglycerides levels and heart health, causing a slight but significant reduction of coronary death and coronary events, &#x003c9;-3 FAs intake is generally recommended (with some differences in public health advice across countries) [<xref rid="B9-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Getting &#x003c9;-3 FAs directly through fish consumption is usually preferable. However, when it is impossible to get enough &#x003c9;-3 FAs exclusively through the diet, supplementation may represent an effective option (that should always be discussed with a doctor) [<xref rid="B9-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Supplements may also offer a solution to some downsides of seafood consumption, i.e., the potential concurrent intake of environmental pollutants such as dioxins or heavy metals, which could compromise the health status of people consuming contaminated fish regularly because of bioaccumulation].</p></sec><sec id="sec4-molecules-26-01002"><title>4. Omega-3 Fatty Acids Recovery from Fish Waste: Some Critical Issues</title><p>When considering the whole process that leads from fish waste to &#x003c9;-3 FAs formulations, some inherent critical issues and technical challenges regarding the processing of this raw material must be taken into account. These include degradation phenomena and the possible presence of contaminants that may be coextracted.</p><p>Waste from the food supply chain is characterized by an elevated content in water and nutrients and it is, in general, a good growth medium for bacteria and fungi that can be toxic and/or deteriorate active compounds at room temperature and in a short time, impairing their nutritional value.</p><p>Microbial spoilage under anaerobic storage conditions can cause fish waste deterioration resulting in a complex mixture of chemical products like volatile nitrogen or sulfur compounds (e.g., ammonia or hydrogen sulfide).</p><p>The high content in PUFAs makes fish waste highly susceptible to lipid peroxidation, a complex oxidative process that proceeds by a free-radical mediated chain reaction and involves three main steps: initiation (or induction), propagation, and termination.</p><p>For the chain reaction to start, the presence of a trigger like heat, light, metal, peroxide, or hydroperoxide is necessary. The reaction is initiated by the abstraction of a hydrogen atom followed by the addition of an oxygen radical. In general, PUFAs consist of 1,4-pentadiene structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-01002-f002">Figure 2</xref>) that are particularly sensitive to lipid peroxidation: the methylene hydrogens are weakly bonded to the C atom and are easily abstractable. The removal of a hydrogen atom at the bisallylic position leads to the formation of an alkyl radical (L<sup>&#x02022;</sup>) that is stabilized by a molecular rearrangement of the double bond to form a conjugated diene (CD). CDs absorb UV radiation and can be monitored by absorbance at 234 nm [<xref rid="B42-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>Dienes can combine with oxygen to form a peroxyl radical (LOO<sup>&#x02022;</sup>) creating hydroperoxides (LOOH) and other radicals, thus propagating the reaction (autoxidation). Hydroperoxides can eventually split into alkoxy radicals (LO<sup>&#x02022;</sup>) and hydroxy radicals (<sup>&#x02022;</sup>OH), generally considered primary products of lipid peroxidation. This chain of reaction can be schematized as follows:<disp-formula>LH &#x02192; L<sup>&#x02022;</sup> + <sup>&#x02022;</sup>H</disp-formula>

Fish Oil Extraction</title><p>The fish raw material consists of three main fractions: solid (free fat dry matter), oil, and water. Numerous apparatuses and techniques have been developed to extract fish oil, to improve both yield and quality. Hundreds of experimental articles, reviews, and patents have been published not only describing technical issues but also drawing attention to the profitability of the process, which should be ideally easily scalable on an industrial scale [<xref rid="B51-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p><p>Traditional lipid extraction techniques are based on their hydrophobicity and involve the use of organic solvents like hexane, petroleum ether, methanol, and chloroform [<xref rid="B52-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="B53-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The choice of the solvent is affected by many factors: low boiling point (to ease the recovery of the product), cost, availability, flammability, disposal procedures, and toxicity. The extraction efficiency is high but due to the restriction in using organic solvents in the food industry and to the research of environmentally friendly and sustainable processes, they are currently used on a laboratory scale, often for comparative or analytical purposes. A classic method is described by Bligh and Dyer in 1959 [<xref rid="B54-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].</p><p>To reduce time and use of solvents it is possible to use the Soxhlet extractor, an apparatus that operates recycling a minor amount of solvent ensuring continuous contact between waste and solvent. Despite its efficiency, a shortening in time, and a decrease in solvent consumption, the drawbacks of solvent extraction are not completely overcome. To further reduce costs and time, some variations assisted by microwaves or ultrasounds are possible and will be discussed in the next section [<xref rid="B1-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>An interesting yet emerging strategy to replace classic organic solvents was proposed by Ciriminna et al. in 2019: limonene from waste orange peel was used to extract &#x003c9;-3 FAs from anchovy filleting leftovers by maceration under mechanical stirring at room temperature. The solvent can be removed under reduced pressure and recycled in consecutive extraction cycles. The two major costs of this process are the labor and the electricity needed to recover the solvent [<xref rid="B55-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="B56-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].</p><p>On an industrial scale, fish oil extraction is commonly carried out by a process known as &#x0201c;wet reduction&#x0201d; (or &#x0201c;wet rendering&#x0201d;), which avoids the impact of traditional methods with organic solvents. This process is described in detail by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations [<xref rid="B47-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]: although outdated, this document offers an interesting and informative description of the method.</p><p>The process aims to separate the three fractions through several unit operations, including:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Cooking;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Pressing/Centrifugation;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Decantation;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Drying.</p></list-item></list></p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-01002-f003">Figure 3</xref> shows the complete block flow diagram (BFD) of a typical process that leads from the waste to the final products, but some alternatives may occur. The layout of the plant depends on different parameters including the equipment for each operation, energy-saving facilities, automation, environmental protection, and raw material content in terms of dry matter, protein, and fat. In particular, if the fat content is less than 3%, the recovery of oil could not be economically convenient [<xref rid="B47-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>Cooking&#x02014;High temperature coagulates protein and induces the rupture of the cell walls, releasing oil and water. This step is crucial for a successful oil extraction. Different ranges of temperature and time have been investigated pointing out that cooking at 90&#x02013;100 &#x000b0;C for 15&#x02013;20 min allows achieving optimum results. It is noteworthy that control of the heating temperature and time is essential to avoid an overcooking that may affect the compressibility and prevent effective evaporation of water due to the presence of suspended solids. Furthermore, the extreme temperature may induce the degradation of thermolabile compounds via lipid peroxidation [<xref rid="B43-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. According to the characteristics of the raw material, different conditions and equipment may be required so, practical experience is paramount to obtaining a high-quality product [<xref rid="B47-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>Pressing&#x02014;The sludge resulting from the cooking step is pressed to remove most of the solid that is used to produce fishmeal. To achieve a good separation the material should present an appropriate grade of porosity to make the liquid flow more easily through the solid. Two fractions are obtained: press liquor (oil, water, and some solid residues) and press-cake (wet solid). A quicker and more controllable separation is achieved by centrifugation, which is preferred when the solid content is high. A drawback to this operation is the production of emulsions that may hinder the following operations. Besides, the higher content in residue moisture requires an increase in fuel consumption [<xref rid="B47-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>Decantation&#x02014;The separation of the press liquor may be carried out by decantation or centrifugation, both based on the specific gravity of each component. Decantation is an inexpensive but slow operation that consists of leaving the press liquor in a tank until the three layers are separated. This solution usually does not allow high yield and has been overtaken by centrifugation that speeds up the process improving the quality of the product but it is still adopted in small plants because a centrifugation apparatus could be not economically justified.</p><p>Drying&#x02014;The press-cake is unstable due to the content in moisture that should not exceed 12% (recommended moisture content in animal feed) [<xref rid="B8-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The solid is disintegrated, mixed, and heated at high temperature (ca. 100 &#x000b0;C) to ease the removal of water and prevent microbial activity, killing bacteria that may be present (e.g., <italic>Salmonella</italic>). Higher temperatures should be avoided because they may alter the nutritional value and induce lipid peroxidation as well. The cost of drying is affected by the content in water: since fat and water content are inversely related, a high fat/water ratio not only will improve oil yield but would also reduce drying energy [<xref rid="B47-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The resulting proteinaceous flour-type material is used as animal feed.</p></sec><sec id="sec6-molecules-26-01002"><title>6. Alternative Methods for Oil Extraction</title><p>Despite avoiding the use of organic solvents, wet rendering is an energy-intensive process and may prompt the degradation of heat-sensitive PUFAs. Consequently, alternative methods are sometimes considered to extract fish oil from waste. These include microwave-assisted extraction (MAE), ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE), enzymatic methods, and the use of supercritical fluids (SFs) [<xref rid="B57-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>].</p><p>MAE uses microwaves to warm solvents in contact with the biomass reducing its moisture and resulting in increased pressure that disrupts the cell membranes of the fish. The extraction process is sped up, lower temperatures are required, and automatization is possible, but the heat generation may induce oxidative degradation. The extraction efficiency is affected by the time and frequency of microwaves, time, and sample particle size. This method is not commonly used for fish oil extraction but some studies show that the efficiency is similar or greater than traditional techniques [<xref rid="B57-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. A green solvent such as water can be used, making this method attractive from an environmental point of view [<xref rid="B58-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>].</p><p>UAE exploits acoustic cavitation to break the cell walls: the mechanical impact improves the penetration of the solvent and eases the release of the oil. Advantages are decreased extraction time and solvent consumption while the major drawbacks are the high power consumption and the difficulty of scale-up [<xref rid="B57-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The number of publications about the application of this method in fish oil extraction is scarce, but yields seem to be comparable or higher than those of conventional methods [<xref rid="B59-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="B60-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].</p><p>An interesting option that requires neither organic solvents nor high temperature is the enzymatic extraction that involves the use of exogenous proteolytic enzymes (e.g., protease, exopeptidase, or endopeptidase) to remove lipids from fish waste [<xref rid="B61-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="B62-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Several low-cost commercial enzymes are available but alcalases seem to extract the highest amount of fish oil. Other parameters to be considered are enzyme concentration, pH, reaction time, and temperature. An increase in the enzyme concentration improves the extraction provided that there is substrate available to bind to. The optimum pH depends on the enzyme but in general extreme values can induce enzyme denaturation and must be avoided. Low temperatures usually do not provide enough energy to promote the collisions between the enzyme and the substrate and favor the binding. Even if an increase in temperature speeds up the reaction, extreme temperatures inactivate the enzymes due to their denaturation. Three phases are obtained: a heavy phase on the bottom (mainly containing polar lipids), an intermediate phase containing water-soluble material, and a light oily phase enriched in neutral lipids. These methods are in line with green chemistry practices: enzymes are reusable, there is no need for toxic solvents or extreme temperature conditions, and byproducts production is limited. It is possible to obtain &#x003c9;-3 FAs enriched oil with low energy requirement and low investment for a large scale process [<xref rid="B51-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. However, the oil usually needs further treatments to remove some undesired components and the scale-up may be difficult [<xref rid="B57-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>].</p><p>A supercritical solvent is a fluid that under specific conditions of temperature and pressure (in the region above its critical point) shows unique properties: density-wise it is similar to a liquid while its viscosity, diffusivity, and compressibility are similar to the gas ones. Since the polarity of SFs increases with density, and because of the variation of density with pressure and temperature, tuning these two parameters modulates SCF solvent power allowing the extraction and/or concentration of a wide range of substances [<xref rid="B51-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The most used SCF is scCO<sub>2</sub> because its critical conditions are relatively easy to access (Tc = 304.15 K and Pc = 7.38 MPa). It is considered safe because non-toxic, non-corrosive, and non-flammable. Moreover, it can be easily removed after the extraction because it is gaseous and leaves no traces in the product. Operating at low temperatures, this technique is suitable for thermolabile compounds, while the displacement of the oxygen by the scCO<sub>2</sub> contributes to preserving &#x003c9;-3 FAs from oxidation [<xref rid="B63-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>].</p><p>When dealing with supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), pretreatment of the waste is important because it defines water content and particle size. Water hampers CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion and affects oil solubility in scCO<sub>2</sub>, so often waste is freeze-dried before extraction. Despite the energy requirement, the extraction yield is significantly improved. Particle size, on the other hand, affects extraction yields, limiting mass transfer, and causing channeling phenomena [<xref rid="B63-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>].</p><p>SFE is useful when processing raw material with low oil content because cooking causes the formation of a stable water/oil emulsion that is difficult to separate. It achieves similar or better yields in comparison with other methods, prevents lipids oxidation, significantly reduces some kinds of pollutants [<xref rid="B51-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Despite being a promising method, it has not replaced the wet rendering method on an industrial scale, partly due to the high initial investment. The cost could be compensated by the elevated yields and the high selectivity, which reduces the need for extensive refining. Moreover, it should be considered that the power consumption might affect the sustainability of the process if the energy is not supplied exploiting renewable resources.</p></sec><sec id="sec7-molecules-26-01002"><title>7. Fish Oil Refining</title><p>The production of oil suitable for food consumption requires the removal of undesired compounds that may affect consumer acceptability (e.g., smelly or colored substances) and sometimes be toxic (e.g., heavy metals, dioxins, or polychlorinated biphenyls) [<xref rid="B50-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="B51-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].

The latter are present as calcium or magnesium salts of phosphatidic acid and are separated by treating the oil with phosphoric or citric acid that converts them into the hydratable form. This treatment also positively affects the stability of the oil because removes part of the metals that can act as a pro-oxidant.</p><p>The neutralization is the clearing of free FAs and residual phospholipids by reaction with alkalis (typically soda) to reduce oil acidity. Free fatty acids are converted into soaps that can be easily separated by centrifugation due to their insolubility in oil. Alkalis also react with some of the pigments that cause unpleasant colors, improve the aspect of the oil.</p><p>The bleaching is the absorption of pigments, trace metals, oxidation products, and other contaminants using activated earth or carbon that should be carefully eliminated by filtration because may content residual metals that can act as pro-oxidant.</p><p>Deodorization is the removal of smelly compounds and it is usually carried out by steam distillation at high temperature (190&#x02013;210 &#x000b0;C).

Fractionation of intact TAGs would lead to oil containing also the other fatty acid linked to the glycerol backbone (concentrations of up to ca. 30% EPA and DHA) [<xref rid="B20-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. To achieve a high grade of purity it is necessary to free the FAs from the glycerol moiety and this is usually done by transesterification of crude oil with an alcohol to give fatty acid monoesters. The preparation of such esters is commonly carried out by lipid analysts to convert fatty acid components into esters to be analyzed by GC. Fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) are usually preferred for analytic purposes while for food application ethanol is preferred because it is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).</p><p>TAG transesterification consists of a succession of three reversible reactions, each one releasing a FA ester molecule. TAGs are firstly converted to diglycerides (DAGs) that are in turn converted to monoglycerides (MAGs) and finally to glycerol [<xref rid="B69-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,<xref rid="B70-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Overall, three fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) and one glycerol unit are produced from one TAG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-01002-f004">Figure 4</xref>). About 10 w/w% of the total product is constituted of glycerol that can be purified and converted into value-added chemicals [<xref rid="B15-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>While a wide range of strategies is possible to carry out transesterification for analytical purposes [<xref rid="B71-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], on a large scale strong acid or alkaline catalysts are usually preferred. However, the choice should be made aiming at reducing costs, energy utilization, and/or waste generation while keeping reaction yield high, and innovative techniques such as enzymatic catalysis are gaining interest.</p><p>Acid catalysis: an acidic catalyst allows both esterification and transesterification under similar conditions. In the first case, a carboxylic acid is protonated to give an oxonium ion that reacts with the alcohol to give in turn an intermediate that can lose a proton and form an ester. In the case of transesterification, a protonated ester reacts with the alcohol forming an intermediate that dissociates into the desired product. Both esterification and transesterification need an excess of alcohol to shift the equilibrium toward esters formation because each step is reversible. Besides, water should be excluded because it is a stronger electron donor than alcohol and hindered the progress of the reaction. Some commonly used reagents are alcoholic solutions of hydrogen chloride or sulfuric acid [<xref rid="B71-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>].</p><p>Alkaline catalysis: an alkaline catalyst allows transesterification but not esterification. In an alkaline medium, esters form an anionic intermediate that can form the new ester. Carboxylate anions do not undergo a nucleophilic attack by alcohols because of their negative charge.

A combination of two or more of them is often needed because the raw material is extremely heterogeneous and contains different undesirable compounds. The most suitable method depends on raw material composition, target purity, selectivity, stability, and environmental considerations. Fractionation of FAEEs cannot always be carried out by conventional processes, because of thermal degradation of polyunsaturated chains, or the presence of residual solvent in the final product [<xref rid="B60-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="B76-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>].

Triglycerides are hydrolyzed to give free fatty acids that are treated with urea and ethanol. Urea can form solid-phase complex molecules with linear alkyl chains like SFAs and MUFAs. These complexes precipitate under cooling (ca. 20 &#x000b0;C) and are removed by filtration, leaving a liquid fraction enriched in PUFAs [<xref rid="B1-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B20-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B78-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>,<xref rid="B79-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. This technique is generally considered inexpensive due to the low cost of reagents, and ecofriendly because the whole process only requires little compounds that are generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by FDA. This method allows a 60% recovery and can be used as a preliminary purification step before other purification processes. Some concerns have been raised by U.S. FDA in 1999 due to the formation of ethyl carbamates (EC), a potent animal and human carcinogen, from the reaction of urea and ethanol [<xref rid="B80-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>].

Compounds are separated according to their vapor pressures under high vacuum conditions (10<sup>&#x02013;3</sup> bar), forcing the molecules to travel a pathway that is shorter than their mean free path. FAEEs have a lower boiling point than triglycerides (ca. 450 &#x000b0;C vs. &#x0003e;900 &#x000b0;C) and this allows an easier separation [<xref rid="B64-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,<xref rid="B81-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>].

Moreover, these methods can carry out the &#x003c9;-3 FAs enrichment dealing directly with intact TAGs, skipping the transesterification step. Microbial lipases hydrolyze TAGs into fatty acids, acylglycerols, and glycerol.

Tuning temperature and pressure (typically from 90 to 300 bar and from 298 to 337 K) it is possible to modulate scCO<sub>2</sub> solvent properties, possibly using ethanol to improve the solubility of more polar compounds.

However, different results in different studies may depend on the nutritional matrix and the study duration [<xref rid="B85-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Human ethyl esters processing involves the conversion to triglycerides delaying their release to the bloodstream. The conversion of &#x003c9;-3 ethyl esters back into triglycerides form raises from the observation that &#x003c9;-3 FAs absorption seems to be faster and higher when TAGs are consumed [<xref rid="B63-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="B85-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>].</p><p>This reaction can be carried out by enzyme-assisted methods (e.g., using lipases): ethyl esters are converted to free fatty acids that are in turn esterified with glycerol to produce highly concentrated triglycerides. The use of specific lipases reduces the formation of byproducts, allows mild reaction conditions, and limits the need for organic solvents. Ethanol is produced during the reaction and should be removed because it is toxic to the enzyme and could inhibit the reaction shifting the equilibrium towards the reagents.

The favorable and tunable properties of supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> make it a very and sustainable alternative to other processing methods.</p><p>Another interesting example has been recently published reporting the implementation of sustainable options in the production of &#x003c9;-3 FAs concentrates from <italic>Thunnus albacares</italic> waste and its benefit from an environmental, economic, and social point of view [<xref rid="B94-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. The manuscript by Monsivais et al. shows how alternative options at different levels can have a significant effect on the final environmental or social impact of the product, thus generating several ways to improve the circular economy model. In this context, the most profitable design is not always the optimal-sustainable and, therefore, a maximum economic advantage does not always guarantee a circular economy achievement.</p><p>Different interactive factors are contributing to an effective reduction of waste reduction and different solutions should be adopted in different contexts. Besides, a detailed evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages should always be carried out because the best option is not always evident. For example, while aquaculture has provided a source of food and income, contributing to reducing and reusing waste material, on the other hand, fish farming requires the majority of fish body oil and affects coastal environments and biodiversity because of the release of organic waste and chemicals used for medication [<xref rid="B6-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Future industry development must not set aside social issues and provide quality and accessible products to the communities that represent the workforce and mankind&#x02019;s progress cooperatively.</p><p>Governments should proactively act in building effective policies and regulations, supporting innovative solutions with adequate infrastructure and services. Their action would fall within the global commitment demonstrated by &#x0201c;The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development&#x0201d;, a set of 17 interconnected goals, adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015.</p><p>The fisheries and aquaculture sectors are related to SDG 14, &#x0201c;Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development&#x0201d;. However, the proper management of fish waste and its contribution to providing food, nutrition, and employment, is also strictly related to the SDG 12, entitled &#x0201c;Responsible consumption and production&#x0201d;.</p><p>Passing on to the economic side of the recovery, the price of fish oil reached 2800 USD/ton in 2015 while in the same year the &#x003c9;-3 FAs market worth 28 billion euros (ca. 30 billion USD) [<xref rid="B13-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B64-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Provided that the valorization process is carried out following sustainable practices, the exploitation of fish waste is a promising tool to match the increased market demand maximizing the economic potential of this valuable resource. In compliance with circular economy and zero waste principles, fish waste represents an invaluable source of products: &#x003c9;-3 FAs concentrates, MAG and DAG that can be used as emulsifiers, glycerol for the production of other valuable chemicals, FAEEs other from DHA and EPA as liquid biofuel, fish bones as a source of minerals, collagen, and gelatin. An informative synoptical presentation of various fish waste uses is given by Arvanitoyannis and Kassaveti in a review of 2008 [<xref rid="B6-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec12-molecules-26-01002"><title>12. Conclusions</title><p>Fish oil-derived dietary supplements are widely marketed across the world and this urges the development of responsible strategies to utilize resources that are renewable but not infinite. The efficient minimization and exploitation of fish waste and its transformation into high-value products is an attractive solution both from an environmental and economic point of view.</p><p>Despite undeniable signs of progress, great room for improvement exists, making essential the promotion of sustainable practices sustained by technological innovation and government policies. Further research is necessary to obtain highly pure, stable, safe, and bioavailable &#x003c9;-3 concentrates, while clear communication of improvements in sustainability along with the safety of products obtained from waste is essential to consumers&#x02019; acceptability. Waste should not be considered less valuable than the fish itself but a precious and profitable resource capable of bringing health, social, economic, and environmental benefits.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The review was written within the context of the project N.
