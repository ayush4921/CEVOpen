<p>Light and oxygen exposure, heating, and pro-oxidants, such as lipoxygenases, singlet oxygen, and transition metals accelerate lipid oxidation. Precaution should be taken during the whole processing: waste should be immediately frozen and stored in glass or Teflon sealed containers, trying to minimize air contact. Freezing damages tissue because osmotic shock and crystal formation break membranes that separate lipids from lipolytic enzymes that are still active at −20 °C, so lower temperatures are needed [
