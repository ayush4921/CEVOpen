<p>The peroxide value (PV) measures primary oxidation products by titration, while secondary non-volatile oxidation products (e.g., 2-alkenols and 2,4-alkadienals) are determined by their reaction with 
 <italic>p</italic>-anisidine (pAV). Since a colorimetric method is used to determine pAV, this test is not suitable for colored oils absorbing at 350 nm due to interference phenomena. Moreover, since 
 <italic>p</italic>-anisidine reacts with aldehydes, this test is unsuitable for flavored oil because they are often added with aldehydes containing additives.
