<p>For the chain reaction to start, the presence of a trigger like heat, light, metal, peroxide, or hydroperoxide is necessary. The reaction is initiated by the abstraction of a hydrogen atom followed by the addition of an oxygen radical. In general, PUFAs consist of 1,4-pentadiene structures (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-01002-f002">Figure 2</xref>) that are particularly sensitive to lipid peroxidation: the methylene hydrogens are weakly bonded to the C atom and are easily abstractable. The removal of a hydrogen atom at the bisallylic position leads to the formation of an alkyl radical (L
