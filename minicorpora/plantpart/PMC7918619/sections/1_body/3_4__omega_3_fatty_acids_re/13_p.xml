<p>Other tests that are used for determining the oxidative quality of oils include the spectrophotometric measurement of conjugated dienes or the determination of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) by the TBARS assay that measures the malondialdehyde (MDA) and its related compounds. Interpretation of data from this assay requires caution because prolonged heating can cause the evaporation of volatile secondary oxidation products resulting in a decrease in TBARS.</p>
