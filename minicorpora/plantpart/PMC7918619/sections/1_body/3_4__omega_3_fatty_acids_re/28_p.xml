<p>Refining processes get rid of most undesired components or reduce them to an acceptable level for human consumption. Neutralization, deodorization, and bleaching remove metals and persistent organic pollutants while molecular distillation is effective at removing halogenated compounds. These techniques operate sometimes under conditions that can alter the quality of the oil, promoting its oxidation. Treatment with activated carbon absorbs dioxins and PCBs under milder conditions without affecting DHA and EPA content.</p>
