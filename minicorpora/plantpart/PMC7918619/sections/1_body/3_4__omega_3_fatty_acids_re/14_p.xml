<p>Some consequences on the quality and nutritional values are the decrease in caloric content and the loss in essential fatty acids and lipid-soluble vitamins. Lipid peroxidation can damage cell structures, impact membrane functionality, and is involved in the toxicity process that leads to cell death. Moreover, some oxidation products are related to aging, mutagenesis, and carcinogenesis. For example, aldehydes such as MDA can bind to proteins and nucleic acids [

However, clinical trial results are not always conclusive, and potentially harmful effects may vary with dose, actual local concentration, human metabolism, and antioxidant defenses. In addition, some oxidation products from Ï‰-3 FAs may be beneficial to health [
