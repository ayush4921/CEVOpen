<p>These parameters account for the progression of the oxidation process. Peroxides are the first compounds created so an increase in PV is initially observed. As the oil oxidizes, peroxides react to give secondary products, so PV decreases, and pAV increases. The ToTox value (“total oxidation of the oil”) takes into account both primary and secondary oxidation products and is calculated as follow:
 <disp-formula>ToTox = (2 × Peroxide value) + (1 × Anisidine value)
  <label>(1)</label>
 </disp-formula>
