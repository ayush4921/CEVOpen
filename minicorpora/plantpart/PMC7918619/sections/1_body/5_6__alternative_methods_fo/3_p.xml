<p>UAE exploits acoustic cavitation to break the cell walls: the mechanical impact improves the penetration of the solvent and eases the release of the oil. Advantages are decreased extraction time and solvent consumption while the major drawbacks are the high power consumption and the difficulty of scale-up [
