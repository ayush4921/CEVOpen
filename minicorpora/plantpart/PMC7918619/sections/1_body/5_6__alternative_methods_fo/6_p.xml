<p>When dealing with supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), pretreatment of the waste is important because it defines water content and particle size. Water hampers CO
 <sub>2</sub> diffusion and affects oil solubility in scCO
 <sub>2</sub>, so often waste is freeze-dried before extraction. Despite the energy requirement, the extraction yield is significantly improved. Particle size, on the other hand, affects extraction yields, limiting mass transfer, and causing channeling phenomena [
