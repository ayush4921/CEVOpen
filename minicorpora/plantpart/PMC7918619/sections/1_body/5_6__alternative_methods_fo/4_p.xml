<p>An interesting option that requires neither organic solvents nor high temperature is the enzymatic extraction that involves the use of exogenous proteolytic enzymes (e.g., protease, exopeptidase, or endopeptidase) to remove lipids from fish waste [

 <xref rid="B62-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Several low-cost commercial enzymes are available but alcalases seem to extract the highest amount of fish oil. Other parameters to be considered are enzyme concentration, pH, reaction time, and temperature. An increase in the enzyme concentration improves the extraction provided that there is substrate available to bind to. The optimum pH depends on the enzyme but in general extreme values can induce enzyme denaturation and must be avoided. Low temperatures usually do not provide enough energy to promote the collisions between the enzyme and the substrate and favor the binding. Even if an increase in temperature speeds up the reaction, extreme temperatures inactivate the enzymes due to their denaturation. Three phases are obtained: a heavy phase on the bottom (mainly containing polar lipids), an intermediate phase containing water-soluble material, and a light oily phase enriched in neutral lipids. These methods are in line with green chemistry practices: enzymes are reusable, there is no need for toxic solvents or extreme temperature conditions, and byproducts production is limited. It is possible to obtain Ï‰-3 FAs enriched oil with low energy requirement and low investment for a large scale process [
