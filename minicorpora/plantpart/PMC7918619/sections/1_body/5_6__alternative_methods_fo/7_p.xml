<p>SFE is useful when processing raw material with low oil content because cooking causes the formation of a stable water/oil emulsion that is difficult to separate. It achieves similar or better yields in comparison with other methods, prevents lipids oxidation, significantly reduces some kinds of pollutants [
 <xref rid="B51-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Despite being a promising method, it has not replaced the wet rendering method on an industrial scale, partly due to the high initial investment. The cost could be compensated by the elevated yields and the high selectivity, which reduces the need for extensive refining. Moreover, it should be considered that the power consumption might affect the sustainability of the process if the energy is not supplied exploiting renewable resources.
