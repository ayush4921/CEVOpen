<p>MAE uses microwaves to warm solvents in contact with the biomass reducing its moisture and resulting in increased pressure that disrupts the cell membranes of the fish. The extraction process is sped up, lower temperatures are required, and automatization is possible, but the heat generation may induce oxidative degradation. The extraction efficiency is affected by the time and frequency of microwaves, time, and sample particle size. This method is not commonly used for fish oil extraction but some studies show that the efficiency is similar or greater than traditional techniques [
