<p>Phospholipids are usually found in fish roes, krill oil, and to some extent in oily fish and have recently received increasing attention for their health benefits. While TAGs and ethyl esters are hydrophobic, phospholipids are hydrophilic and this affects their physicalâ€“chemical properties. PLs and TAGs are equivalently absorbed in the small intestine but their delivery in different organs may be different.</p>
