<p>Traditional micronization and encapsulation techniques do not usually allow a high level of control of particle size distribution. Moreover, they often use toxic and polluting solvents and need high temperature, unsuitable for thermolabile compounds. For example, spry drying requires high temperatures that may cause oil deterioration [
