<p>This reaction can be carried out by enzyme-assisted methods (e.g., using lipases): ethyl esters are converted to free fatty acids that are in turn esterified with glycerol to produce highly concentrated triglycerides. The use of specific lipases reduces the formation of byproducts, allows mild reaction conditions, and limits the need for organic solvents. Ethanol is produced during the reaction and should be removed because it is toxic to the enzyme and could inhibit the reaction shifting the equilibrium towards the reagents. Additionally, in this case scCO
 <sub>2</sub> can be used as a solvent at low temperatures and in an oxygen-free atmosphere.
