<p>Encapsulation of Ï‰-3 FAs is currently achieved by different techniques. Among classical methods, spray-drying and coacervation are widely used also on a large scale. The selection of the more appropriate method depends on the interaction of the solvent with the compound of interest, the desired morphology, the particle size distribution, and solvents used (if any) [
 <xref rid="B87-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. The choice of the coating material is critical and closely connected to the method of encapsulation: it should have low viscosity, good film-forming proprieties, and neutral organoleptic characteristics. Moreover, it should ensure the preservation of the bioactive core from degradation [
