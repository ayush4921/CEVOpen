<p>Other parameters to be evaluated are the encapsulation efficiency and the residual solvent concentration. Encapsulation efficiency is the proportion of fish oil encapsulated with respect to the theoretical content and is essential to the economic feasibility of the process. It also affects the acceptability of the product, because external oil is more susceptible to oxidation, impairing its organoleptic features. It can be determined by GC quantifying the fatty acid previously methylated. Residual solvent concentration should comply with food and drug regulations.</p>
