<p>The extent of the absorption of the different chemical forms of EPA and DHA is a debated issue. Omega-FAs absorption seems to decrease in the following order: fatty acids, triglycerides, and ethyl esters. However, different results in different studies may depend on the nutritional matrix and the study duration [
 <xref rid="B85-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Human ethyl esters processing involves the conversion to triglycerides delaying their release to the bloodstream. The conversion of ω-3 ethyl esters back into triglycerides form raises from the observation that ω-3 FAs absorption seems to be faster and higher when TAGs are consumed [
