<p>Two approaches are possible: larger particles may be reduced to a smaller size (“top-down”) or microparticles can be built from molecules in solution (“bottom-up”). Classical top-down methods include homogenization and grinding, while techniques involving supercritical fluids usually belong to the second kind of approach.</p>
