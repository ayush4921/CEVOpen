<p>Supercritical fluids reduce the use of organic solvents, preserve the lipids from oxidation, and allow producing not only micro- but also nanocapsules at low temperature and under an inert atmosphere. Three main SFC micronization variants do exist:

   <p>Supercritical solvent precipitation: the fluid is used to solubilize non-polar active ingredients (e.g., essential oils and non-polar small compounds). An example is the expansion of supercritical solutions (RESSs), with both the active ingredient and the coating at high pressure are dissolved in sCO
    <sub>2</sub>. The pressurized solution is rapidly expanded through an orifice. Due to supersaturation, the coating material desolvates and deposits around the active compound forming the capsules [

    <sub>2</sub> but it is interesting because it is completely solvent-free and allows particles with a size &lt;1 μm [

   <p>Supercritical antisolvent precipitation: the active ingredient is dissolved in an organic solvent and the supercritical fluid is used as an antisolvent to induce its precipitation, by extracting the organic solvent from the solution. Examples are supercritical antisolvent (SAS) and supercritical fluid extraction of emulsions (SFEE). SAS is used to produce highly bioavailable capsules of hydrophobic compounds or hydrophilic compounds that can be homogeneously dispersed in an organic solvent. The solute is dissolved (or dispersed) in a suitable solvent then the addition of the supercritical fluid causes a reduction in solubility and the consequent precipitation of micro- and nanoparticles [
    <xref rid="B91-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. In the SFEE technique, to encapsulate lipophilic compounds a stable oil-in-water emulsion is formed. The organic solvent is rapidly extracted by the counter-current flow of scCO
    <sub>2</sub> that induces the active ingredient and the polymer precipitation [
    <xref rid="B87-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. This technique was used to encapsulate fish oil rich in ω-3 PUFAs using polycaprolactone (PCL) as a coating polymer and reaching 8 nm particle size [
    <xref rid="B84-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. Among its advantages, it is easily scalable for industrial applications using countercurrent packed columns and it allows the production micro- and nanoparticles with controlled size and morphology. Moreover, the control of the particle morphology is possible on a wide range of sizes, from nano to micro [
    <xref rid="B88-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. The encapsulation of fish oil by a supercritical antisolvent process using hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) as a polymer is reported as suitable for the industrial application [

   <p>Supercritical fluid as a solute: this technique exploits the high diffusivity of scCO
    <sub>2</sub> and its low viscosity to make it diffuse into solutions, polymer melts, and fatty acids. An example is particles from gas saturated solutions (PGSSs): a compressed fluid is dissolved into a solution that is then expanded through a nozzle into a spray chamber at atmospheric pressure. Due to the expansion, the CO
    <sub>2</sub> is removed by evaporation, and the temperature decreases, causing the polymer solidification. This technique is suitable for lipids because they melt at a mild temperature [

   <p>Methods based on drying technology: in these techniques, the supercritical fluid is used to dry aqueous solution and wet samples avoiding high temperatures that may damage thermolabile compounds. An aqueous solution is sprayed into an excess of the supercritical fluid. The water is broken up into tiny droplets that are easily removed from the fluid flow.</p>
