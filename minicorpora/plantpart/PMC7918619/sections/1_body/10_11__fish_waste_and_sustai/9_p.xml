<p>In 2017, Fiori et al. published a case study of a biorefinery strategy for fish waste valorization into Ï‰-3 FAs concentrates, protein for fish farming applications, and short-chain FAEEs for fuel production [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In general, technologies based on supercritical scCO
 <sub>2</sub> can be used in different phases of the waste processing (extraction, refining, transesterification, concentration, and encapsulation), provide conditions that reduce the risk of oxidation (low temperature and inert atmosphere), show good solvent and mass transport properties, and offer the possibility of recycling the fluid by decompression and recompression cycles. Another advantage is that CO
 <sub>2</sub> is gaseous at room temperature and pressure, easily providing solvent-free products. The favorable and tunable properties of supercritical CO
 <sub>2</sub> make it a very and sustainable alternative to other processing methods.
