<p>Another interesting example has been recently published reporting the implementation of sustainable options in the production of Ï‰-3 FAs concentrates from 
 <italic>Thunnus albacares</italic> waste and its benefit from an environmental, economic, and social point of view [
 <xref rid="B94-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. The manuscript by Monsivais et al. shows how alternative options at different levels can have a significant effect on the final environmental or social impact of the product, thus generating several ways to improve the circular economy model. In this context, the most profitable design is not always the optimal-sustainable and, therefore, a maximum economic advantage does not always guarantee a circular economy achievement.
