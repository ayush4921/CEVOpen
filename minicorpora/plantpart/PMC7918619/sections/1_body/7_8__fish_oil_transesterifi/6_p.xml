<p>Alkaline catalysis: an alkaline catalyst allows transesterification but not esterification. In an alkaline medium, esters form an anionic intermediate that can form the new ester. Carboxylate anions do not undergo a nucleophilic attack by alcohols because of their negative charge. Again, an excess of alcohol is needed to displace the equilibrium and the presence of water should be limited because it causes the intermediate to dissociate into the free acid. Sodium or potassium ethoxide complete the reaction extremely quickly but potassium hydroxide is often used because it is easier to handle. When the reaction is completed, a diluted acid can be added to neutralize the base [
