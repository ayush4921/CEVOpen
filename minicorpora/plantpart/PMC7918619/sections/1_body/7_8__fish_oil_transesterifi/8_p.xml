<p>On an industrial scale, alkaline catalysis is one of the most frequently used methods because of its low cost. Several parameters should be considered when optimizing the reaction condition including the ethanol/oil molar ratio, the catalyst concentration, the water content in ethanol, the reaction temperature time.</p>
