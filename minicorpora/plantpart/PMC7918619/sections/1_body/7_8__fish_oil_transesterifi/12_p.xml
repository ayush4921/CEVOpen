<p>Chemical transesterification is well established but poses serious environmental problems. Enzymatic methods have been proposed to save energy and minimize thermal degradation of Ï‰-3 FAs and several lipases are commercially available for this purpose. Lipases are widely used because of their versatility, being able to catalyze both hydrolysis and transesterification reactions under mild conditions, limiting the use of organic solvents. Moreover, these enzymes can be immobilized in appropriate supports and reused providing an economic benefit. The production of FAEEs can be performed in one step or two-steps procedures. In the one-step reaction, the oil is directly transesterified to FAEEs while in the two-steps hydrolysis is followed by esterification.</p>
