<p>While a wide range of strategies is possible to carry out transesterification for analytical purposes [
 <xref rid="B71-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], on a large scale strong acid or alkaline catalysts are usually preferred. However, the choice should be made aiming at reducing costs, energy utilization, and/or waste generation while keeping reaction yield high, and innovative techniques such as enzymatic catalysis are gaining interest.
