<p>FAs are naturally present in fish oil in the form of triacylglycerols with Ï‰-3 PUFAs preferentially bound at the sn-2 position of the glycerol backbone because this position offers higher stability against oxidation [

 <xref rid="B20-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. To achieve a high grade of purity it is necessary to free the FAs from the glycerol moiety and this is usually done by transesterification of crude oil with an alcohol to give fatty acid monoesters. The preparation of such esters is commonly carried out by lipid analysts to convert fatty acid components into esters to be analyzed by GC. Fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) are usually preferred for analytic purposes while for food application ethanol is preferred because it is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
