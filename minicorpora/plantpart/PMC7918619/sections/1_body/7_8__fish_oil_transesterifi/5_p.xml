<p>Acid catalysis: an acidic catalyst allows both esterification and transesterification under similar conditions. In the first case, a carboxylic acid is protonated to give an oxonium ion that reacts with the alcohol to give in turn an intermediate that can lose a proton and form an ester. In the case of transesterification, a protonated ester reacts with the alcohol forming an intermediate that dissociates into the desired product. Both esterification and transesterification need an excess of alcohol to shift the equilibrium toward esters formation because each step is reversible. Besides, water should be excluded because it is a stronger electron donor than alcohol and hindered the progress of the reaction. Some commonly used reagents are alcoholic solutions of hydrogen chloride or sulfuric acid [
