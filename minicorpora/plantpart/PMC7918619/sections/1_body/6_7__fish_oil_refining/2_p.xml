<p>The degumming removes hydratable and non-hydratable phospholipids from the oil. The former are separated through the addition of water that makes them insoluble in the oil and removable by filtration or centrifugation (water degumming). The latter are present as calcium or magnesium salts of phosphatidic acid and are separated by treating the oil with phosphoric or citric acid that converts them into the hydratable form. This treatment also positively affects the stability of the oil because removes part of the metals that can act as a pro-oxidant.</p>
