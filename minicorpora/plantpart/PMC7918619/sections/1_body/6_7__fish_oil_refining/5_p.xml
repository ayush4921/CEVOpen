<p>Deodorization is the removal of smelly compounds and it is usually carried out by steam distillation at high temperature (190–210 °C). Since at temperatures above 180 °C lipid peroxidation occurs, the process may be performed under reduced pressure or nitrogen atmosphere. Besides removing volatile compounds that alter the taste and the odor of the oil, pigments and other contaminants may be removed as well.</p>
