<p>Overall, since evidence exists that EPA and DHA have a positive effect on serum triglycerides levels and heart health, causing a slight but significant reduction of coronary death and coronary events, ω-3 FAs intake is generally recommended (with some differences in public health advice across countries) [

However, when it is impossible to get enough ω-3 FAs exclusively through the diet, supplementation may represent an effective option (that should always be discussed with a doctor) [

Supplements may also offer a solution to some downsides of seafood consumption, i.e., the potential concurrent intake of environmental pollutants such as dioxins or heavy metals, which could compromise the health status of people consuming contaminated fish regularly because of bioaccumulation].
