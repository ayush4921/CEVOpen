<p>These observations stem from numerous observational and prospective studies. However, caution must be exercised when trying to undoubtedly correlate a benefit to a specific bioactive compound (in this case, ω-3 FAs in seafood). Other aspects should be taken into account, including the presence of other nutrients, the substitution of seafood for other less healthy foods, a better social status, or a health-conscious lifestyle. Besides, a combination of different factors cannot be ruled out. The availability of data from randomized clinical data is essential but unfortunately these data are often conflicting and not conclusive. This may be ascribed not only to the different doses used in different studies but also to differences in population, diet, therapies, or statistical analysis. For example, some prospective studies relate a higher intake of omega-ω-3 fatty acids with a lower risk of breast and colorectal cancer, but genetic risk and gender seem to play an important role requiring additional research [
