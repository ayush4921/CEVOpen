<p>Omega-3 FAs play both a structural role as components of cell membranes (regulating their architecture and permeability) and a metabolic role (providing energy for the body). Moreover, they are used to produce eicosanoids, oxygenated metabolites involved in many cell-signaling pathways regulating the modulation of cardiovascular, pulmonary, reproductive, immune, and endocrine systems. Some examples are prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and leukotrienes [
