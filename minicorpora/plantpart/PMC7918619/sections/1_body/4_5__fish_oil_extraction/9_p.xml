<p>Pressingâ€”The sludge resulting from the cooking step is pressed to remove most of the solid that is used to produce fishmeal. To achieve a good separation the material should present an appropriate grade of porosity to make the liquid flow more easily through the solid. Two fractions are obtained: press liquor (oil, water, and some solid residues) and press-cake (wet solid). A quicker and more controllable separation is achieved by centrifugation, which is preferred when the solid content is high. A drawback to this operation is the production of emulsions that may hinder the following operations. Besides, the higher content in residue moisture requires an increase in fuel consumption [
