<p>Drying—The press-cake is unstable due to the content in moisture that should not exceed 12% (recommended moisture content in animal feed) [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The solid is disintegrated, mixed, and heated at high temperature (ca. 100 °C) to ease the removal of water and prevent microbial activity, killing bacteria that may be present (e.g., 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic>). Higher temperatures should be avoided because they may alter the nutritional value and induce lipid peroxidation as well. The cost of drying is affected by the content in water: since fat and water content are inversely related, a high fat/water ratio not only will improve oil yield but would also reduce drying energy [
