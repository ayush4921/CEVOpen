<p>Decantationâ€”The separation of the press liquor may be carried out by decantation or centrifugation, both based on the specific gravity of each component. Decantation is an inexpensive but slow operation that consists of leaving the press liquor in a tank until the three layers are separated. This solution usually does not allow high yield and has been overtaken by centrifugation that speeds up the process improving the quality of the product but it is still adopted in small plants because a centrifugation apparatus could be not economically justified.</p>
