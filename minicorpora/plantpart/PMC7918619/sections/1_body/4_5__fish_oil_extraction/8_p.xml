<p>Cooking—High temperature coagulates protein and induces the rupture of the cell walls, releasing oil and water. This step is crucial for a successful oil extraction. Different ranges of temperature and time have been investigated pointing out that cooking at 90–100 °C for 15–20 min allows achieving optimum results. It is noteworthy that control of the heating temperature and time is essential to avoid an overcooking that may affect the compressibility and prevent effective evaporation of water due to the presence of suspended solids. Furthermore, the extreme temperature may induce the degradation of thermolabile compounds via lipid peroxidation [
