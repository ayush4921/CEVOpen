<p>An interesting yet emerging strategy to replace classic organic solvents was proposed by Ciriminna et al. in 2019: limonene from waste orange peel was used to extract Ï‰-3 FAs from anchovy filleting leftovers by maceration under mechanical stirring at room temperature. The solvent can be removed under reduced pressure and recycled in consecutive extraction cycles. The two major costs of this process are the labor and the electricity needed to recover the solvent [
