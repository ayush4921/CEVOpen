<p>Traditional lipid extraction techniques are based on their hydrophobicity and involve the use of organic solvents like hexane, petroleum ether, methanol, and chloroform [

 <xref rid="B53-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The choice of the solvent is affected by many factors: low boiling point (to ease the recovery of the product), cost, availability, flammability, disposal procedures, and toxicity. The extraction efficiency is high but due to the restriction in using organic solvents in the food industry and to the research of environmentally friendly and sustainable processes, they are currently used on a laboratory scale, often for comparative or analytical purposes. A classic method is described by Bligh and Dyer in 1959 [
