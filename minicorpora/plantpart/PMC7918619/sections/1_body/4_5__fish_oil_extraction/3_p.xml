<p>To reduce time and use of solvents it is possible to use the Soxhlet extractor, an apparatus that operates recycling a minor amount of solvent ensuring continuous contact between waste and solvent. Despite its efficiency, a shortening in time, and a decrease in solvent consumption, the drawbacks of solvent extraction are not completely overcome. To further reduce costs and time, some variations assisted by microwaves or ultrasounds are possible and will be discussed in the next section [
