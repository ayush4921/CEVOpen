<p>All these factors must be taken into account when choosing a waste source for extraction of ω-3 fatty acids and explain why data on fish FAs composition are not always similar [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. For example, considering the fatty acid profiles of thirteen different seafood species caught in the Northeastern Mediterranean coast, SFAs range from 27.68 to 36.59%, MUFAs from 8.99 to 35.84%, and PUFAs from 10.69 to 39.57%. FAs typically detected are myristic acid (C14:0), palmitic acid (C16:0), palmitoleic acid (C16:1ω7) heptadecanoic acid (C17:0), stearic acid (C18:0), vaccenic acid (C18:1ω-7), oleic acid (C18:1ω-9), linoleic acid (C18:2ω-6), arachidonic acid (C20:4ω-6), cis-5,8,11,14,17-EPA (C20:5ω-3) and cis-4,7,10,13,16,19-DHA (C22:6ω-3) [
