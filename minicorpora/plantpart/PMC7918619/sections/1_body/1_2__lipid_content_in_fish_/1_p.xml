<p>Lipids are mainly present in fish oil as triacylglycerols (TAGs), fatty acid esters of glycerol. Glycerol carbon atoms are numbered according to a stereochemical system, positions sn-1 and sn-3 being the outers, position sn-2 the central one (

 <sup>3</sup> different molecules (including enantiomers) are possible, giving each oil its unique and complex composition [
