<p>Fish lipids are currently being extracted from a wide range of species, including cod, herring, mackerel, tuna, salmon, anchovy, menhaden, and sardine [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Byproducts availability varies within species and processing methods, but usually includes viscera, skin, heads, bones, and fins. The oil distribution in the tissues is usually heterogeneous. For example, mackerel’s skin, which is usually discarded during processing, has a higher content of PUFAs if compared with viscera and muscle [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Livers and viscera of little tuna (
 <italic>Euthynnus alletteratus</italic>) contain a higher lipid amount than the other organs [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Tuna heads are a common raw material but their cooking yields a dark and malodorous oil, which requires several refinery processes [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Tuna eyeballs that are separated from tuna heads before cooking could render higher quality fish oil rich in ω-3 FAs (32.72% DHA and 7.07% EPA, with respect to total PUFAs) reducing the number of steps in the refinery process [
