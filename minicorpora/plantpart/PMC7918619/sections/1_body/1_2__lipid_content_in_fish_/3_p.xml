<p>Broadly speaking, the lipid composition of fish widely varies according to geographic location, type of water (marine or freshwater), feed, season, and maturity of the fish [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Additional differences may be caused by post-capture handling and processing. Food availability is a major determinant of fish fatty acids composition since fish are not able to produce ω-3 FAs but accumulate them from algae, plankton, and prey fish [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Accordingly, EPA and DHA content is higher in marine fish than in freshwater fish because marine plankton presents a high level of ω-3 PUFAs [

 <xref rid="B20-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Farmed fish may be characterized by a higher content of DHA and EPA depending on their feed (typically fishmeal or fish oil) [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In spring and summer food is usually more available than in other seasons so fat storage increases [
