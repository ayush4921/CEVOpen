<p>An interesting example of process design, modeling, and economical feasibility of fish oil fractionation by supercritical fluids was presented by Fiori et al., pointing out how the whole fractionation can be performed at an industrial scale utilizing relatively mild conditions (temperature below 100 Â°C) [
 <xref rid="B83-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Three indicators were considered: yield, recovery, and quality (85 wt % of C20 and C22). The authors modeled an SFF process using commercial software (Aspen Plus
 <sup>TM</sup>) and used this model to evaluate the effects of several parameters, including the feed ratio, reflux ratio, temperature, and pressure. Moreover, operation costs were optimized, considering the investment cost and economic feasibility for different plant sizes and pointing out the advantages of working with large capacity plants.
