<p>Omega-3 fatty acids concentration can be performed using different technologies, including molecular distillation (MD), urea precipitation, enzymatic enrichment, and supercritical fluid techniques. A combination of two or more of them is often needed because the raw material is extremely heterogeneous and contains different undesirable compounds. The most suitable method depends on raw material composition, target purity, selectivity, stability, and environmental considerations. Fractionation of FAEEs cannot always be carried out by conventional processes, because of thermal degradation of polyunsaturated chains, or the presence of residual solvent in the final product [
