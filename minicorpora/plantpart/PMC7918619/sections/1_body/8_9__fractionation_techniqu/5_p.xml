<p>Currently, the most utilized method to concentrate ω-3 FAs at an industrial scale is probably molecular distillation (MD), also known as short path distillation. Compounds are separated according to their vapor pressures under high vacuum conditions (10
 <sup>–3</sup> bar), forcing the molecules to travel a pathway that is shorter than their mean free path. FAEEs have a lower boiling point than triglycerides (ca. 450 °C vs. &gt;900 °C) and this allows an easier separation [
