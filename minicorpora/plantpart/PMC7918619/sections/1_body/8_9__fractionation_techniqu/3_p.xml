<p>Urea fractionation can separate FAs according to their degree of unsaturation [
 <xref rid="B77-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Triglycerides are hydrolyzed to give free fatty acids that are treated with urea and ethanol. Urea can form solid-phase complex molecules with linear alkyl chains like SFAs and MUFAs. These complexes precipitate under cooling (ca. 20 Â°C) and are removed by filtration, leaving a liquid fraction enriched in PUFAs [

This technique is generally considered inexpensive due to the low cost of reagents, and ecofriendly because the whole process only requires little compounds that are generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by FDA. This method allows a 60% recovery and can be used as a preliminary purification step before other purification processes. Some concerns have been raised by U.S. FDA in 1999 due to the formation of ethyl carbamates (EC), a potent animal and human carcinogen, from the reaction of urea and ethanol [
