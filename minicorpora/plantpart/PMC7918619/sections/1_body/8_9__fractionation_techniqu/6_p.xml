<p>To avoid problems related to PUFAs thermolability enzyme-catalyzed methods allowing mild operating conditions and chemicals have been developed [
 <xref rid="B61-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Some lipases can discriminate against ω-3 fatty acids and this ability has been ascribed to the steric hindrance provided by the double bonds in the active site of the enzyme. Moreover, these methods can carry out the ω-3 FAs enrichment dealing directly with intact TAGs, skipping the transesterification step. Microbial lipases hydrolyze TAGs into fatty acids, acylglycerols, and glycerol. Free fatty acids are then esterified with simple alcohol or glycerol [
