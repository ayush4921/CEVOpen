<p>Supercritical fluid chromatography proved to be a valuable and effective method to reach high enrichment levels. Tuning temperature and pressure (typically from 90 to 300 bar and from 298 to 337 K) it is possible to modulate scCO
 <sub>2</sub> solvent properties, possibly using ethanol to improve the solubility of more polar compounds. Both packed or capillary columns can be used, and appropriately choosing stationary phases and operation conditions, highly pure Ï‰-3 FAs concentrates can be obtained also at a large scale suitable for food and pharmaceutical applications [

Octadecylsilane-grafted silica and alkali-treated alumina stationary phases give a better resolution. A coupled system SFE-SFC can be used to remove polar FFAs or oxidation products [
