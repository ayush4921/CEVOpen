<p>Phase equilibria data and thermodynamic and kinetic models are essential to a proper separation process because phase equilibrium data and suitable equations of state allow one to predict miscibility regions under different conditions and thus reduce the experimental effort. Actually, due to the high cost of investment for the construction of pilot plants, research often focuses on constructing models, performing simulations of equilibrium stage separations, and comparing their outputs with experimental data.</p>
