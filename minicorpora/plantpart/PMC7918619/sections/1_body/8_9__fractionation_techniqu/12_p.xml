<p>In a study by Alkio et al. [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-26-01002" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], the technical and economic feasibility of an ester concentrate from tuna oil is presented. In industrial chromatography, the increased amount in injection volume causes a decrease in column efficiency and high loads in lower yields. Some drawbacks are the high cost of investments that in this case are also used to special coating materials used in stationary phase manufacturing, nonetheless, a large-scale SFC plant is already operating producing fatty esters concentrate at &gt;95% purity.
