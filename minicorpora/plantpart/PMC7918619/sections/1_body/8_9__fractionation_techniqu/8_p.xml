<p>Short-chain FAEEs are more soluble in scCO
 <sub>2</sub> than long-chain FAEEs and this difference in solubility serves as a basis for the fractionation. In a typical separation process, the liquid FAEE mixture flows downwards, while the scCO
 <sub>2</sub> flows upwards (in counter-current) solubilizing short-chain FAEEs that exit the column from the top, giving an enrichment of EPA and DHA in the raffinate (the liquid remaining inside at the bottom of the column). The lighter phase is partly condensed and recycled after recompression (reflux). When the system is brought back to atmospheric pressure, the oil is completely separated from the carbon dioxide, leading to the complete removal of the solvent [
