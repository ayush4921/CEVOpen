0: In accordance with the circular economy and the zero-waste concepts [ 14], not only is a sustainable extraction and purification of -3 FAs from fish waste desirable, but it should be strongly encouraged since all the byproducts of the process can be turned into valorized products: protein moiety as animal feed and source for enzymes and bioactive peptides, glycerol for the production of valuable chemicals short-chain unsaturated fatty acids (FAs) as liquid biofuel, fish bones as a source of minerals, collagen, and gelatin [ 7, 15].
1: Waste valorization should be carried out minimizing the environmental impact, by ensuring that the whole process of recovery provokes a lower impact than other waste management practices.
