<p>In the past decades, over 300 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling soybean seed oil and protein content have been identified using accessions with the different genetic background [
 <xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], suggesting that soybean oil and protein content are subject to a highly diverse and complex genetic control. Although great efforts have been dedicated to utilizing diverse genetic resources to develop cultivars containing both improved protein and oil traits or improve one trait without a negative impact on the other trait, progress has been limited. In contrast, it was observed that US commercial cultivars released over the past several decades contain decreased seed protein content (

To effectively exploit the soybean diversity to improve the seed traits with no or little negative impact on the others, it is crucial to identify the causative genes/alleles for major QTLs and illustrate the molecular basis underlying their associated trait interaction and genetic diversity in soybean domestication and breeding.
