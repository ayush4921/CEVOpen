0: In the past decades, over 300 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling soybean seed oil and protein content have been identified using accessions with the different genetic background [ 7], suggesting that soybean oil and protein content are subject to a highly diverse and complex genetic control.
1: Although great efforts have been dedicated to utilizing diverse genetic resources to develop cultivars containing both improved protein and oil traits or improve one trait without a negative impact on the other trait, progress has been limited.
2: In contrast, it was observed that US commercial cultivars released over the past several decades contain decreased seed protein content ( http://unitedsoybean.org/), which is likely an unintended consequence of a strong selection for high oil.
3: To effectively exploit the soybean diversity to improve the seed traits with no or little negative impact on the others, it is crucial to identify the causative genes/alleles for major QTLs and illustrate the molecular basis underlying their associated trait interaction and genetic diversity in soybean domestication and breeding.
