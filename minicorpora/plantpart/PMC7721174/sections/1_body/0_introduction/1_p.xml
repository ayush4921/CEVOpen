<p>Cultivated soybean [
 <italic>Glycine max</italic> (L.) Merr.] is an important seed crop grown worldwide. It was domesticated from wild soybean (
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>soja</italic> Sieb. and Zucc.) in East Asia approximately 6,000–9,000 years ago and has been further improved through breeding as a major oilseed crop to provide a source of both valuable vegetable oil and protein for uses in food, feed, and industrial applications [

Unlike in Asia where farmers grew locally adapted landraces and selections of them for thousands of years, soybean has a short history in North America, and it was introduced to North America in 1765. Soybean had been mostly grown as a forage crop in North America for the next 155 years until the importance of soybeans as a valuable source of protein and oil was realized at the beginning of the 20th century. Starting from the 1920s, soybean has been grown as a seed/grain crop mainly for seed protein and oil. Soybean yield (bushels per acre) nearly doubled since 1987 [
