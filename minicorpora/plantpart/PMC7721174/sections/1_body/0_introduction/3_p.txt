0: In the present study, having applied a combination of high confidence bi-parental linkage mapping using a population of recombinant inbred lines (RIL) and high-resolution association analysis using 631 diverse whole genome sequences, we mapped a major protein and oil content QTL on chr15 to a sugar transporter gene and demonstrated that the sugar transporter gene was preferentially expressed in seed coat tissues.
1: We further revealed that a 2-bp (CC)-deletion in the gene was associated with the variation of seed oil and protein content.
2: The CC deletion was selected during soybean domestication and improvement.
3: Haplotype analyses showed that a CC deletion-carrying haplotype is widely present in cultivated soybeans grown worldwide and has been fixed in US modern soybean breeding, highlighting the significance of the high-oil CC-deletion haplotype in soybean improvement.
4: The CC-deletion allele also contributes to low protein in modern soybean cultivars, a big problem facing the current soybean industry.
5: Our result will greatly advance our understanding of these complex seed quality traits and benefit seed improvement in soybean.
