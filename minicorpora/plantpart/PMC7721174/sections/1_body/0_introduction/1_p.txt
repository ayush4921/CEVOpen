0: Cultivated soybean [ Glycine max (L.) Merr.]
1: is an important seed crop grown worldwide.
2: It was domesticated from wild soybean ( G.  soja Sieb.
3: and Zucc.)
4: in East Asia approximately 6,0009,000 years ago and has been further improved through breeding as a major oilseed crop to provide a source of both valuable vegetable oil and protein for uses in food, feed, and industrial applications [ 1].
5: Unlike in Asia where farmers grew locally adapted landraces and selections of them for thousands of years, soybean has a short history in North America, and it was introduced to North America in 1765.
6: Soybean had been mostly grown as a forage crop in North America for the next 155 years until the importance of soybeans as a valuable source of protein and oil was realized at the beginning of the 20th century.
7: Starting from the 1920s, soybean has been grown as a seed/grain crop mainly for seed protein and oil.
8: Soybean yield (bushels per acre) nearly doubled since 1987 [ 2], making soybean one of the sustainable crops to meet the rapid demand for plant-based protein and oil for a continuously increasing world population [ 3].
9: However, it was often observed that protein content in seeds is quantitatively inherited and negatively correlated with seed oil content and yield [ 4 6], making it challenging to increase soybean protein content while maintaining the desired seed oil level and seed yield.
