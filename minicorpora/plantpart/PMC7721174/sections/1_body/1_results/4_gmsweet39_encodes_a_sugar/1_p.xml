<p>We examined expression patterns of 
 <italic>GmSWEET39</italic> (CC-) in soybean major organs and different seed compartments of Williams 82 at different seed development stages using the Goldberg-Harada Soybean RNA-Seq Dataset (

 <italic>GmSWEET39</italic> was predominantly expressed in the floral bud and developing seeds (

 </bold>). Briefly, the accumulation of 
 <italic>GmSWEET39</italic> transcripts in seeds was detected as early as the globular stage and reached the highest level at the early maturation stage over the course of seed development. The transcript abundance significantly decreased after seeds reached the early maturation stage and it was undetectable in the late maturation and dry seed stages. Before the early maturation stage, transcripts of 
 <italic>GmSWEET39</italic> began to accumulate in some subregions of the seed coat such as the inner/outer integuments during the heart and cotyledon stages (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1009114.g002">Fig 2I</xref>
 </bold>), transcripts of 
 <italic>GmSWEET39</italic> showed a significant accumulation in subregions of the cotyledon (abaxial epidermis) and seed coat (parenchyma). Notably, the transcript abundance in the parenchyma of the seed coat at the early maturation stage was approximately 60â€“400 times higher than in the abaxial epidermis and outer integument at the cotyledon stage. Expression patterns of 
 <italic>GmSWEET39</italic> in the aforementioned compartments of developing seeds were illustrated in

 </bold>. These results suggest the special role of 
 <italic>GmSWEET39</italic> during seed development, especially in the parenchyma of the seed coat. In plants, parenchyma is the innermost part of the seed coat with direct contact with the endosperm [
 <xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This layer is crucial in assimilate unloading from the maternal seed coat and in the initiation of the storage phase in legumes [
 <xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Given that 
 <italic>GmSWEET39</italic> encoded a sugar transporter that is specifically expressed in seed coat subregions during seed development, it is reasonable to presume that GmSWEET39 plays an important role in facilitating sugar transfer in the seed coat to allocate photosynthetic sucrose into the embryo and that the increased sucrose accumulation enhances the subsequent sucrose-derived fatty acid biosynthesis [
