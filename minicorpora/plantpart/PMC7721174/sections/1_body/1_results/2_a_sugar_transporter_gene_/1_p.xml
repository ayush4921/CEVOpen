<p>To uncover the gene(s) underlying 
 <italic>qSeedOil_15</italic> and 
 <italic>qSeedPro_15</italic>, we carried out association analyses of the two traits with DNA variants within the 4 Mb QTL region using a panel of 631 diverse wild and cultivated soybean accessions collected worldwide. Accessions in this panel had a wide variation in seed protein (32.5–52.3%) and oil content (10.1–23.5%). Overall, the two traits were significantly negatively correlated (

 </bold>). We analyzed the whole genome sequences of the 631 accessions and identified a total of 96,813 DNA variants including 79,725 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 17,088 insertions and deletions (indels) in this 4-Mb region. These DNA variants in the region were tested for their associations with oil and protein. The association analysis revealed that three most significant indels (DT15_3875621, DT15_3875101, DA15_3874703) for oil content located in a cluster of DNA variants spanning a 34-kb region that was highly significant (
