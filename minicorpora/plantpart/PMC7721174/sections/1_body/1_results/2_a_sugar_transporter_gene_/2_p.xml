<p>The three most significant variants were all located within the genomic region of 
 <italic>Glyma</italic>.
 <italic>15G049200</italic>. The indel DT15_3875101 (--/CC, reference/alternative allele) located in the coding region (exon 6), while the other two, DT15_3875621 (TATC/----) and DA15_3874703 (--/TA), located in the 4th intron and the 3â€™ untranslated region (UTR) respectively. The CC indel was polymorphic in two parents of the RIL population. The high-oil and low-protein parent (Williams82) contained the CC deletion (CC-) that was not present in the low-oil and high-protein parent (PI479752). The CC deletion in the coding sequence (CDS) of 
 <italic>Glyma</italic>.
 <italic>15G049200</italic> caused a frameshift (see below). We examined 
 <italic>Glyma</italic>.
 <italic>15G049200</italic> genomic sequences of 631 accessions in the association panel and identified two

 <italic>max</italic> accessions containing the gene sequence identical to Williams82-type allele except for the CC deletion. The two accessions contained significantly lower oil content and higher protein in seeds than accessions carrying the Williams82-type allele (

 </bold>), confirming that the CC indel rather than the other two non-CDS DNA variants was causative of oil and protein variation. We also examined the parental lines (PI468916, PI407788A, PI483460B and Williams82) of bi-parental linkage mapping populations whose protein and oil QTLs were mapped to the genomic regions overlapped with

 <italic>15G049200</italic> contained 9.5% less oil (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1009114.g001">Fig 1F</xref>

 <italic>15G049200</italic> was the only one of the six genes within the linkage disequilibrium block showing predominant expression in developing seeds (
