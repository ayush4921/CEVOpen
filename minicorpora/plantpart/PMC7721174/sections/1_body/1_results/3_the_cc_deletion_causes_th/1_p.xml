 <italic>15G049200</italic> was previously assigned as 
 <italic>GmSWEET39</italic> in a 
 <italic>SWEET</italic> (Sugars Will Eventually be Exported Transporters) gene family analysis [
 <xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The CC indel (DT15_3875101) occurred in the coding region and caused a reading frameshift starting from the 730th nucleotide of GmSWEET39. The frameshift resulted in a premature stop codon and six amino acid changes at the C-terminus of GmSWEET39 in Williams82 (

  <bold>Fig 2A</bold> and 
  <bold>2B</bold>
 </xref>). Thus, the CC deletion truncated 19 amino acids from the C-terminus of GmSWEET39 in Williams82 compared with the intact GmSWEET39 in PI479752 (

 <italic>AtSWEET15</italic> gene [
 <xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], intact 
 <italic>GmSWEET39</italic> encoded a sugar transporter protein with seven predicted transmembrane (TM) domains and a cytoplasmic C-terminal tail (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1009114.g002">Fig 2D</xref>
 </bold>). Lack of the 19 C-terminal amino acids and the C-terminal amino acid changes in Williams82-type GmSWEET39 caused no obvious change in the predicted 3-D protein structure of the seventh TM domain compared to GmSWEET39 in PI479752 (
 <bold>
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1009114.g002">Fig 2E</xref>
 </bold>). However, the reading frameshift changed three amino acids in the cytoplasmic C-terminal tail that appeared to be highly conserved in legumes (
 <bold>
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1009114.g002">Fig 2F</xref>
 </bold>). Sequence alignment showed conservation between GmSWEET39 and two AtSWEETs (AtSWEET13, AtSWEET15) in four key amino acids that were specific to disaccharide transport [
 <xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], suggesting the potential role of GmSWEET39 in transporting disaccharides (
 <bold>
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1009114.g002">Fig 2G</xref>
 </bold>). It remains to be determined how the amino acid sequence change and loss of the 19 amino acids affect the activity of GmSWEET39 and impact oil and protein accumulation in seeds.
