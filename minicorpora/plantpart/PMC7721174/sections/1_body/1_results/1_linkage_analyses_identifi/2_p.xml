<p>Composite interval mapping with the SoySNP50K genotyping data identified two major QTLs on chr15 and chr20 (

 <italic>qSeedOil_15</italic> was flanked by two markers Gm15_2391075_G_A and Gm15_6028005_A_G (8.94–29.10 cM), while 
 <italic>qSeedPro_15</italic> was flanked by Gm15_1989918_T_G and Gm15_5829758_G_T (7.18–28.21 cM). Both QTLs physically spanned approximately 4 Mb (physical interval, chr15: 2.0–6.0 Mb) and 92.0% of the two QTL intervals overlapped. This region coincided with previously-published major QTLs for seed oil or protein content in soybean [

 <xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], indicating that this region contained a major QTL gene(s) contributing significantly to the large variation in both protein and oil content.
