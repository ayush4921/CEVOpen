<p>We split the panel of accessions into wild soybean (

 <italic>soja</italic> accessions. The allelic frequency of the CC deletion increased over the course of soybean domestication and improvement with 2.59% (3 of 114) in wild soybean, 76.15% (99 of 130) in landrace and 85.39% (76 of 89) in improved cultivar (
