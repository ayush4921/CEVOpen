<p>In consistence with observed negative relationship of oil and protein content, protein content reduced in CC- accessions during the domestication and improvement (

 <italic>soja</italic> to landrace. On the contrary, protein content was significantly increased by 4.38% (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) in CC+ accessions during the transition from landrace to cultivar. This finding with protein changes suggested that CC+ allele of 
 <italic>GmSWEET39</italic> might be selected and used for developing high protein cultivars during the improvement process. These observations implied that soybean might experience two paths for soybean oil and protein improvement using the two distinct alleles of 
 <italic>GmSWEET39</italic>: CC- has been selected/used for oil improvement the over the courses of soybean domestication and improvement while CC+ allele has been selected/used for developing high protein cultivars during the improvement of
