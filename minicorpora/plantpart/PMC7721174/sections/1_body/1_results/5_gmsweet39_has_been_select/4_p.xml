<p>We further examined oil and protein content difference between CC- and CC+ accessions within each germplasm group. Oil was averagely higher in CC- than CC+ accessions within wild (2.8% increase), landrace (2.94% increase, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), and cultivar (4.80% increase,

 <italic>GmSWEET39</italic> on oil and protein. Notably, more dramatic differences for both oil and protein content between CC- and CC+ accessions in cultivars than landrace were observed. This could be the result of differentially integrating oil-favor alleles and protein-favor alleles of other QTLs in CC- and CC+ accessions during soybean improvement for high oil and high protein cultivars, which augment the difference of CC- and CC- cultivars in protein and oil.
