<p>We performed a haplotype analysis for the accessions used in the association panel by examining the sequence diversity of the transcribed genic region of 
 <italic>GmSWEET39</italic> and the 1.0 kb region upstream of the start codon (ATG). Based on patterns of the fragment variants, we identified 19 haplotypes with each detected in at least two accessions (

  <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1009114.s005">S3 Table</xref>
 </bold>). H1-H4 haplotypes were uniquely present in 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>max</italic>, while H5-19 haplotypes were restricted to 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>soja</italic>. CC- was specifically present in H1 haplotype and its accessions accounted for 70.7% (335 accessions) of 474 examined accessions, representing the biggest haplotype group. The rest haplotypes had less than 2.4% haplotype frequency except for H3 with 15.4% (73 of 474 accessions). Consistent with our earlier finding, H1-accessions contained 2.5% higher oil content (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and 2.2% lower protein content (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) than those in accessions carrying H2-H4, and much higher oil content (8.25%, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and lower protein (4.14%, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) than all testing 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>soja</italic> accessions (H5-H19) (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1009114.g004">Fig 4B</xref>
 </bold>). H1 and H2 haplotypes differed only at the CC indel while H1 contained 3.1% higher in oil (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) and 3.4% lower protein content than in H2 haplotypes, further verifying that CC deletion is the major cause of the observed differences in both traits. In contrast, H3 accessions with 2.5% lower oil content (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) contained 2.2% higher seed protein (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) than H1. H1 and H3, collectively representing 98.8% of 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>max</italic> accessions in the association panel, were two major haplotypes of 
 <italic>GmSWEET39</italic> that contributed to the phenotypic variations in oil and protein in 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>max</italic>. However, none of the DNA variants such as CC indel or haplotype variation of 
 <italic>GmSWEET39</italic> accounts for the dramatic differences in protein and oil between 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>soja</italic> and 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>max</italic>. This finding was consistent to the above allelic analysis, suggesting that additional QTLs such as QTL on chr20 might contribute to the observed differences in protein and oil content between 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>soja</italic> and 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>max</italic> accessions.
