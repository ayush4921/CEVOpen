<p>We also mapped all haplotypes to their geographic origins aimed to understand the use of haplotypes in soybean improvement (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1009114.g004">Fig 4C</xref>
 </bold>). Overall, haplotypes (H5-H19) from wild soybean (
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>soja</italic>) were restricted to East Asia where wild soybeans originated [
 <xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In contrast, haplotypes (H1-H4) from cultivated soybean (
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>max</italic>) had a wider geographic distribution worldwide (

 </bold>). Of the four 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>max</italic> haplotypes, H1-carrying accessions with high oil (
 <bold>
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1009114.g003">Fig 3B</xref>
 </bold>) were widely distributed with 75.52% of all accessions (253) found in Asia followed by 16.42% (55) in North America (
 <bold>
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1009114.g004">Fig 4D</xref>
 </bold>). It is important to note that the H1 haplotype was nearly fixed in the United States as 95.92% (47 of 49) of US-bred cultivars in this study carried the H1 allele. To further confirm, we examined CC- allele in 75 historically important landrace and milestone cultivars representing North American soybean breeding history from 1907 to 2002. These cultivars belonged to a wide range of maturity groups (MG) from MG 0 to MG VIII [
 <xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The CC- allele of 
 <italic>GmSWEET39</italic> was present in all of the 75 historical cultivars including the 22 founder cultivars, which have been used in breeding soybean cultivars at varying frequencies (1–44) during the 95 years of North American soybean breeding (

  <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1009114.s006">S4 Table</xref>
 </bold>). These results strongly indicated that the CC- allele of 
 <italic>GmSWEET39</italic> was a preferable allele that has been maintained in modern breeding programs and has been extensively used for soybean improvement worldwide, likely for oil improvement. In contrast, the accessions carrying H3, which contained medium levels of seed oil (16.3%) and protein (45.4%), were mainly from Asia (
 <bold>
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1009114.g004">Fig 4B–4D</xref>
 </bold>). H3 contained the accessions that have been used for breeding high protein varieties, such as PI407788A from South Korea [
 <xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and Enrei from Japan [
