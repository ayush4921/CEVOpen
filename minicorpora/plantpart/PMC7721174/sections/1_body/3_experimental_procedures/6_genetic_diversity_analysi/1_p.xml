<p>All variant data at the 
 <italic>GmSWEET39</italic> locus were used for its genetic diversity analysis. Data were split into two populations by 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>max</italic> and 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>soja</italic>. Genomic differentiation values including the fixation index (
 <italic>Fst</italic>), nucleotide diversity (π), and Tajima’s 
 <italic>D</italic> for 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>max</italic> and 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>soja</italic> were calculated for 10-kb windows with a 5-kb step using VCFtools [
 <xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Haplotype analysis was conducted based on the pattern of variants in the region. Haplotypes must contain at least 2 accessions with clear variants at each site. Pedigree data for the 75 milestone and landrace cultivars were obtained from SoyBase (
