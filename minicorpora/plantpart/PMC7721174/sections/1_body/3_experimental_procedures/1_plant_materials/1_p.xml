<p>A RIL population consisting of 300 lines and a natural population containing 631 diverse soybean accessions were used in this study. This F2:5 RIL population was derived from a genetic cross between soybean (

 <italic>soja</italic>). The parental lines and RILs were planted at the USDA-ARS farms in Beltsville, Maryland, in 2012 and 2015, respectively, each year with two replications in a randomized block design. The seeds per plant were bulk harvested and air-dried. Seed protein and oil content were quantified using near-infrared reflectance (NIR) spectroscopy DA 7250 (Perten Instruments, Sweden) at the USDA-ARS Soybean Genomics and Improvement Laboratory at Beltsville, Maryland. The natural soybean population contained 510

No difference was observed for detecting the two major oil and protein QTLs on chr15 and chr20 by comparing adjusted and non-adjusted raw phenotypic data, which eliminated the concern of adverse effect of GRIN-sourced seed phenotypic data (multiple field locations across multiple years) on association power [
