<p>The linkage map was constructed as previously described [
 <xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. QTLs were detected by the composite interval mapping procedure of the Windows QTL Cartographer v2.5 [
 <xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] with 2.5 as the logarithm of odds ratio (LOD) threshold for detecting a QTL. Association analysis was performed using the mixed model at TASSEL5, using the merged SNPs from three types of DNA variant sources described above. Variants (SNPs and indels) with a minor frequency of ≥ 0.05 on chr15 in the population were used for association analysis. The first five principal components and Kinship matrix calculated using TASSEL5 were included for analysis. We empirically used 
 <italic>P</italic> = 1e-5 as the threshold to determine significant associations. Student’s t-test was carried out to determine the difference significance.
