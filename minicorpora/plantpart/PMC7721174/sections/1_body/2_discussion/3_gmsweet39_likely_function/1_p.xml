<p>It has been well demonstrated that SWEET proteins function in transporting sugar from source tissues to sink tissues [
 <xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Developing seed is one of the major sink organs. In seeds, cells have been differentiated into distinct tissues with diverse functions over seed development. Seed coat including outer integument and parenchyma is located at the interface between maternal seed tissues and the filial embryo, and it functions as the “transfer station” to facilitate the movement of unloaded sugar from maternal tissues to the embryo and cotyledon [
 <xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Evidence have demonstrated that this transporting process is mainly mediated by tissue-specific SWEET proteins in the interface tissues and those proteins are essential for seed filling. For example, in 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, AtSWEET11, -12, -15 is located to the cell membrane of the seed coat [
 <xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The 
 <italic>sweet11;12;15</italic> triple 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutant is defective in sugar delivery from seed coat to developing embryo, which consequently results in reduced starch and oil content and retarded embryo development [
 <xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Here, we demonstrated predominant expression of 
 <italic>GmSWEET39</italic> in outer integument and parenchyma of seed coat tissues at the early maturation stage. The developmental expression of 
 <italic>GmSWEET39</italic> was coincident with the stage when protein and lipid begin to accumulate in seeds [
 <xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. It should also be noted that, at the early maturation stage, 
 <italic>GmSWEET39</italic> exhibited decreasing gradients in expression in three connected layers of tissues, from the parenchyma (seed coat) to abaxial epidermis (cotyledon) and to aleurone (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1009114.g002">
  <bold>Fig 2J</bold> and 
  <bold>2K</bold>
 </xref>), which was coincident with the possible path of sugar flux from maternal seed coat to filial cotyledon [
 <xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Interestingly, we observed that the truncated GmSWEET39 (CC-) had a higher level of oil content, as evidenced by the H1 vs H2 comparison (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1009114.g004">
  <bold>Fig 4A</bold> and 
  <bold>4B</bold>
 </xref>) and supported by recent reports that overexpression of the truncated GmSWEET39 increased oil in seeds [
 <xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that replacing or removing the C-terminal peptide of sugar transporters significantly increased the transport activity by increasing the affinity for the substrates [
 <xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. GmSWEET39 has ability to transport sugar [
 <xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and our protein structural analysis predicted that C-terminal truncation changed its cytoplasmic domain structure. It will be interesting to experimentally test if C terminus truncated GmSWEET39 can facilitate the sugar transport across the membrane. In addition, it was observed that expression of 
 <italic>GmSWEET39</italic> positively correlated with oil content [
 <xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], suggesting that expression variation of 
 <italic>GmSWEET39</italic> potentially also contribute to oil difference in soybean population. Taken together, our study suggests that GmSWEET39 is a highly-specialized protein in transporting sugar from the maternal seed coat to the filial cotyledon over course of seed development.
