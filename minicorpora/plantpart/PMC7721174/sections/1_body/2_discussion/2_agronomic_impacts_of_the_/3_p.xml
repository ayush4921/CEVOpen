<p>It is known that oil and protein content are complex traits controlled by many genes [
 <xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Oil and protein content in soybean seeds could be the accumulative or epistatic effects of these QTL genes [
 <xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Other than 
 <italic>GmSWEET39</italic>, other major QTLs controlling oil and protein content such as 
 <italic>cqPro-20</italic> on chr20 (also identified in our study) and 
 <italic>qOil_05</italic> on chr5 [
 <xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] may also contribute to the total phenotypic variation. We observed that oil content increase in CC-accessions over the course of soybean domestication and improvement, and protein increase in CC+ accessions during soybean improvement. In addition, higher oil and protein differences were detected between CC+ and CC- accessions of modern cultivar than of wild soybean and landrace. The increased and augmented difference likely attribute to continuous and differential integration of additional protein and oil QTLs for higher oil and protein respectively during soybean domestication and improvement. Uncovering related QTL genes and their causative DNA variants will provide a more comprehensive insight into the complex genetic basis underlying the oil and protein variation in soybean and enable us to develop effective strategies for precisely improving oil, protein or both in soybean.
