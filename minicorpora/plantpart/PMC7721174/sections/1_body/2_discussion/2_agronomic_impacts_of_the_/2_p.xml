<p>The allelic analysis revealed that 
 <italic>GmSWEET39</italic> experiences two different paths of selection, CC- allele for high oil during domestication and improvement while CC+ allele for high protein during soybean improvement, which was rarely reported in previous studies. However, artificial selection for CC- allele during domestication and improvement, in part, accounted for the decreasing trend of protein content across the transition of wild-landrace-cultivar due to its negative pleotropic effect on protein content (

 </bold>). In turn, recruiting its counterpart allele (CC+) would offer an opportunity to reverse the general decline of protein content in CC- modern cultivars. For example, Brzostowski and Diers [
 <xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] introgressed a high-protein allele of chr15 QTL in PI407788A into two elite cultivars and showed that lines carrying chr15 QTL from PI407788A contained higher seed protein without significant yield drag compared to the recurrent parents. The Japanese cultivar Enrei contains high seed protein and has been used for breeding high-protein cultivars for soy food production to meet Japanese diet need [
 <xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Our result show that PI407788A and Enrei carried H3 haplotype. Therefore, H3 haplotype is an important allele that still undergoes ongoing selection at the present-day breeding for high protein content, which is in a great need of animal feed and plant-protein based diets worldwide [
 <xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Biased presence of H3 haplotype in cultivated soybeans suggest the haplotype likely offers additional beneficial traits to farmers than the other two haplotypes (H2, H4) if it is not caused by a biased population selection. Identification of the soybean accessions containing diverse 
 <italic>GmSWEET39</italic> haplotypes, knowledge on selection, and distribution of the major haplotypes would allow breeders to effectively select and use appropriate haplotypes for target-based seed improvement.
