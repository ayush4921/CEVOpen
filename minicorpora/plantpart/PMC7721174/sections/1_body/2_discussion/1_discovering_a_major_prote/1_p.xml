<p>Soybean genetic studies mapped many important trait QTLs into large confident intervals generally spanning multi-Mb genomic regions in the past decades. It is still a challenge to identify causative QTL genes and DNA variants/alleles for complex traits within such large DNA regions. The recent availability of genome and transcriptome sequencing data of many diverse soybean accessions and tissues provide an opportunity to dissect those large QTL regions at a single nucleotide and gene level to discover their causative QTL genes and alleles. In this study, having fine-mapped a major protein and oil QTL to a 4-Mb region on chr15 using a bi-parental RIL linkage mapping based on SoySNP50K Chip genotyping data, we effectively pinpointed its QTL causative gene and allele to a sugar transporter gene,

Thus, integration of high confident bi-parental genetic linkage mapping with the high-resolution association analysis of the large panel of diverse wild and domesticated soybean accessions should also offer an effective approach/platform to discover causative genes and alleles underlying other complex traits in soybean and enhance translation from phenotype- and marker-based breeding into causative gene/allele based precision breeding.
