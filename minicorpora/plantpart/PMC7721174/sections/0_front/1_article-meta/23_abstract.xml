 <p>We map highly effective protein and oil QTLs to a seed coat-preferentially expressed sugar transporter (GmSWEET39) gene by a combination of association analysis based on 631 whole-genome sequencing data and a bi-parental linkage mapping, proving that 
  <italic>GmSWEET39</italic> has pleiotropic associations with two of the most important soybean traits, seed protein and oil. A 2-bp (CC) deletion in 
  <italic>GmSWEET39</italic> is associated with higher seed oil and lower seed protein, and has been extensively selected and used worldwide, likely for higher oil. The intensive use or fixation of the CC deletion in soybean breeding result in low protein in current soybean cultivars, which is a big problem facing the current soybean industry. The knowledge about the genetic basis and identification of two major haplotypes for high protein and high oil should be highly significant to address the issue related to low protein in the current soybean industry and meet dramatically increasing need for plant-based protein in the food industry. Our successful integrative and "big-data-driven‚Äù approach, which uses the huge amount of genome and transcriptome sequencing and phenotypic data available in the community, should provide an effective case study for post-genomic data-driven research.
