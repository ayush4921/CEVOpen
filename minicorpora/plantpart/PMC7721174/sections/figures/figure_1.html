 <caption> Identification of the major QTL on chromosome 15 and its underlying candidate gene. ( A) Seed oil and protein from RILs exhibited a negative correlation. ( B) Linkage mapping using RILs identified two overlapping QTLs on Chr15 for oil and protein, respectively. ( C) Regional association analysis identified a cluster of variants significantly associated with oil and protein content. The red solid dot represents a significant association (DT15_3875101). ( D) Six gene models and the LD pattern within the significant 34-kb region. ( E) IGV view of variant patterns between high protein and low protein soybean genotypes. The two variants occurring in the non-coding region were indicated with arrows in black. Variant patterns at the three sites were shown as TATC/--- (alternative/reference), --/CC, and--/TA. ( F) The CC deletion (- -) at DT15_3875101 is highly correlated with high-oil, and low-protein content. CC presence is indicated by CC. * and *** indicate the significance at p&lt; 0.05 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively. </caption>
