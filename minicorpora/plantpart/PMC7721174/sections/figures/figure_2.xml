  <title>Sequence and expression analysis of 
   <italic>GmSWEET39</italic> alleles.
  </title>
  <p>(
   <bold>A</bold>) A schematic diagram shows the sequence variation that occurs in the 6th exon between the two parental lines of the RIL population, Willams82 and PI479752. (
   <bold>B</bold>) The CC deletion in Williams82 causes a reading frameshift and a truncated protein at the C-terminus. (
   <bold>C</bold>) GmSWEET39 is 19 amino acid shorter in Williams82 than it in PI479752. (
   <bold>D</bold>) Predicted transmembrane domains in GmSWEET39. The sequence differences as shown in (
   <bold>B</bold>) and (
   <bold>C</bold>) were highlighted with the gray dotted rectangle. (
   <bold>E</bold>) Comparison of the 3D protein structure between Willams82 and PI479752 GmSWEET39 proteins. The difference in the structure at the C-terminal tails is highlighted with rectangles in blue and red. (
   <bold>F</bold>) Sequence alignment between the C-terminal peptides of the SWEET homologs from different species including legumes. The putatively conserved region was highlighted with the rectangle in red. (
   <bold>G</bold>) GmSWEET39 is conserved at the amino acids essential for disaccharide transport. (
   <bold>H</bold>) A bar plot showing the expression pattern of 
   <italic>GmSWEET39</italic> in different soybean tissues and the whole seeds at different maturation stages. (
   <bold>I</bold>) Relative expression of 
   <italic>GmSWEET39</italic> in different subregions of developing seeds of soybean cultivar Williams 82 (CC deletion) at globular, heart, and cotyledon stages. (
   <bold>J</bold>) Relative expression pattern of CC-deleted 
   <italic>GmSWEET39</italic> in the sub-regions in developing seeds of Williams 82 at the early maturation stage. (
   <bold>K</bold>) Cartoon depicting the expression patterns of 
   <italic>GmSWEET39</italic> in different tissues/compartments of globular, heart, cotyledon, and early maturation seeds of Williams 82 (CC deletion).
