 <caption> Analyses of haplotype distribution worldwide and the use frequency of H1 in US soybean breeding. ( A) A schematic diagram shows the distribution of all DNA variants identified in GmSWEET39 and its putative 1,000-bp promoter region. 19 haplotypes (H) were illustrated in the lower panel. The number of accessions carrying the corresponding haplotypes and the subspecies categorization was indicated beside the panel (B) Phenotypic comparison (oil and protein) among the 19 haplotypes. *, **, and *** indicate the statistical significance at p &lt; 0.05, p &lt; 0.01, and p &lt; 0.001, respectively. ( C) Geographic distribution of two major haplotypes (H1, H3) across the world. ( D) Pie charts show the percentage of the origin of the two haplotypes, H1 and H3, important for oil content and protein content, respectively. The top pie chart in each haplotype shows the overall distribution by continent. The lower charts indicate detailed information for Asia and North America. The percentage, amount of accessions, and origin per haplotype are indicated next to the color representation in the legend. ( E) Number of times that the 22 representative cultivars carrying the CC deletion used in breeding soybean cultivars. Y axis indicates the number of times that the corresponding cultivar has been used for soybean breeding. </caption>
