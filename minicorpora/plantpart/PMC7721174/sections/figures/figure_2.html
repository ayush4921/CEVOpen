 <caption> Sequence and expression analysis of GmSWEET39 alleles. ( A) A schematic diagram shows the sequence variation that occurs in the 6th exon between the two parental lines of the RIL population, Willams82 and PI479752. ( B) The CC deletion in Williams82 causes a reading frameshift and a truncated protein at the C-terminus. ( C) GmSWEET39 is 19 amino acid shorter in Williams82 than it in PI479752. ( D) Predicted transmembrane domains in GmSWEET39. The sequence differences as shown in ( B) and ( C) were highlighted with the gray dotted rectangle. ( E) Comparison of the 3D protein structure between Willams82 and PI479752 GmSWEET39 proteins. The difference in the structure at the C-terminal tails is highlighted with rectangles in blue and red. ( F) Sequence alignment between the C-terminal peptides of the SWEET homologs from different species including legumes. The putatively conserved region was highlighted with the rectangle in red. ( G) GmSWEET39 is conserved at the amino acids essential for disaccharide transport. ( H) A bar plot showing the expression pattern of GmSWEET39 in different soybean tissues and the whole seeds at different maturation stages. ( I) Relative expression of GmSWEET39 in different subregions of developing seeds of soybean cultivar Williams 82 (CC deletion) at globular, heart, and cotyledon stages. ( J) Relative expression pattern of CC-deleted GmSWEET39 in the sub-regions in developing seeds of Williams 82 at the early maturation stage. ( K) Cartoon depicting the expression patterns of GmSWEET39 in different tissues/compartments of globular, heart, cotyledon, and early maturation seeds of Williams 82 (CC deletion).
