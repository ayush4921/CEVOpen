 <caption> Genetic diversity and allele analysis of GmSWEET39. ( A) Genetic diversity (π), Tajima’s D, and fixation index ( Fst) among the three groups across the 1-Mb genomic region harboring GmSWEET39. The horizontal dotted line indicates the genome-wide threshold as described by Wang et al [ 50]. A red dashed line indicates the physical position of GmSWEET39. ( B) Genotype frequency distribution of CC presence (CC) and absence (- -) in GmSWEET39 in wild, landrace, and improved cultivar. Allelic analysis of CC presence (CC) and absence (- -) in GmSWEET39 on oil (C) and protein content ( D). *** indicates the statistical significance at p &lt; 0.001. ns: not significant. </caption>
