  <title>Identification of the major QTL on chromosome 15 and its underlying candidate gene.</title>
  <p>(
   <bold>A</bold>) Seed oil and protein from RILs exhibited a negative correlation. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Linkage mapping using RILs identified two overlapping QTLs on Chr15 for oil and protein, respectively. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Regional association analysis identified a cluster of variants significantly associated with oil and protein content. The red solid dot represents a significant association (DT15_3875101). (
   <bold>D</bold>) Six gene models and the LD pattern within the significant 34-kb region. (
   <bold>E</bold>) IGV view of variant patterns between high protein and low protein soybean genotypes. The two variants occurring in the non-coding region were indicated with arrows in black. Variant patterns at the three sites were shown as TATC/--- (alternative/reference), --/CC, and--/TA. (
   <bold>F</bold>) The CC deletion (- -) at DT15_3875101 is highly correlated with high-oil, and low-protein content. CC presence is indicated by CC. * and *** indicate the significance at 
   <italic>p</italic>&lt; 0.05 and 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, respectively.
