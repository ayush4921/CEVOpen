Merr.] is an important seed crop grown worldwide. It was domesticated from wild soybean (<italic>G</italic>. <italic>soja</italic> Sieb. and Zucc.) in East Asia approximately 6,000&#x02013;9,000 years ago and has been further improved through breeding as a major oilseed crop to provide a source of both valuable vegetable oil and protein for uses in food, feed, and industrial applications [<xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Unlike in Asia where farmers grew locally adapted landraces and selections of them for thousands of years, soybean has a short history in North America, and it was introduced to North America in 1765. Soybean had been mostly grown as a forage crop in North America for the next 155 years until the importance of soybeans as a valuable source of protein and oil was realized at the beginning of the 20th century. Starting from the 1920s, soybean has been grown as a seed/grain crop mainly for seed protein and oil. Soybean yield (bushels per acre) nearly doubled since 1987 [<xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], making soybean one of the sustainable crops to meet the rapid demand for plant-based protein and oil for a continuously increasing world population [<xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, it was often observed that protein content in seeds is quantitatively inherited and negatively correlated with seed oil content and yield [<xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], making it challenging to increase soybean protein content while maintaining the desired seed oil level and seed yield.</p><p>In the past decades, over 300 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling soybean seed oil and protein content have been identified using accessions with the different genetic background [<xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], suggesting that soybean oil and protein content are subject to a highly diverse and complex genetic control. Although great efforts have been dedicated to utilizing diverse genetic resources to develop cultivars containing both improved protein and oil traits or improve one trait without a negative impact on the other trait, progress has been limited. In contrast, it was observed that US commercial cultivars released over the past several decades contain decreased seed protein content (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://unitedsoybean.org/">http://unitedsoybean.org/</ext-link>), which is likely an unintended consequence of a strong selection for high oil. To effectively exploit the soybean diversity to improve the seed traits with no or little negative impact on the others, it is crucial to identify the causative genes/alleles for major QTLs and illustrate the molecular basis underlying their associated trait interaction and genetic diversity in soybean domestication and breeding.</p><p>In the present study, having applied a combination of high confidence bi-parental linkage mapping using a population of recombinant inbred lines (RIL) and high-resolution association analysis using 631 diverse whole genome sequences, we mapped a major protein and oil content QTL on chr15 to a sugar transporter gene and demonstrated that the sugar transporter gene was preferentially expressed in seed coat tissues. We further revealed that a 2-bp (CC)-deletion in the gene was associated with the variation of seed oil and protein content. The CC deletion was selected during soybean domestication and improvement. Haplotype analyses showed that a CC deletion-carrying haplotype is widely present in cultivated soybeans grown worldwide and has been fixed in US modern soybean breeding, highlighting the significance of the high-oil CC-deletion haplotype in soybean improvement. The CC-deletion allele also contributes to low protein in modern soybean cultivars, a big problem facing the current soybean industry. Our result will greatly advance our understanding of these complex seed quality traits and benefit seed improvement in soybean.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Linkage analyses identified a major QTL region controlling both seed oil and protein content</title><p>A population of 300 RILs was used for linkage analyses.

This finding was consistent with the observation that the two QTLs were highly overlapped in the linkage mapping analysis described above (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1009114.g001">Fig 1B</xref></bold>), strongly suggesting that seed oil and protein might be controlled by the same locus.</p><p>The three most significant variants were all located within the genomic region of <italic>Glyma</italic>.<italic>15G049200</italic>. The indel DT15_3875101 (--/CC, reference/alternative allele) located in the coding region (exon 6), while the other two, DT15_3875621 (TATC/----) and DA15_3874703 (--/TA), located in the 4th intron and the 3&#x02019; untranslated region (UTR) respectively. The CC indel was polymorphic in two parents of the RIL population. The high-oil and low-protein parent (Williams82) contained the CC deletion (CC-) that was not present in the low-oil and high-protein parent (PI479752). The CC deletion in the coding sequence (CDS) of <italic>Glyma</italic>.<italic>15G049200</italic> caused a frameshift (see below). We examined <italic>Glyma</italic>.<italic>15G049200</italic> genomic sequences of 631 accessions in the association panel and identified two <italic>G</italic>. <italic>max</italic> accessions containing the gene sequence identical to Williams82-type allele except for the CC deletion. The two accessions contained significantly lower oil content and higher protein in seeds than accessions carrying the Williams82-type allele (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05, see haplotype analysis section, H1 vs H2, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1009114.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref></bold>), confirming that the CC indel rather than the other two non-CDS DNA variants was causative of oil and protein variation. We also examined the parental lines (PI468916, PI407788A, PI483460B and Williams82) of bi-parental linkage mapping populations whose protein and oil QTLs were mapped to the genomic regions overlapped with <italic>qSeedOil_15</italic> and <italic>qSeedPro_15</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Sequence alignments revealed that DT15_3875101 in exon 6 was the only variant in <italic>Glyma</italic>.<italic>15G049200</italic> among these accessions fully associated with oil and protein content (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1009114.g001">Fig 1E</xref></bold>). Notably, seeds of these accessions with the CC presence (CC+) in <italic>Glyma</italic>.<italic>15G049200</italic> contained 9.5% less oil (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) and 4.6% more protein (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) than those with the CC deletion (CC-) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1009114.g001">Fig 1F</xref></bold>). Thus, the CC InDel, not the other two DNA variants, is the causative allele for variation of oil and protein content. In addition, <italic>Glyma</italic>.<italic>15G049200</italic> was the only one of the six genes within the linkage disequilibrium block showing predominant expression in developing seeds (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1009114.g001">Fig 1D</xref></bold>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1009114.s002"><bold>S2A</bold> and <bold>S2B Fig</bold></xref>), implying that the role of <italic>Glyma</italic>.<italic>15G049200</italic> was specific to seed filling. <italic>Glyma</italic>.<italic>15G049200</italic> encoded an ortholog of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> AtSWEET15 sugar transporter (AT5G13170) that also plays a role in lipid accumulation in seeds [<xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].

The CC indel (DT15_3875101) occurred in the coding region and caused a reading frameshift starting from the 730th nucleotide of GmSWEET39. The frameshift resulted in a premature stop codon and six amino acid changes at the C-terminus of GmSWEET39 in Williams82 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1009114.g002"><bold>Fig 2A</bold> and <bold>2B</bold></xref>).

Lack of the 19 C-terminal amino acids and the C-terminal amino acid changes in Williams82-type GmSWEET39 caused no obvious change in the predicted 3-D protein structure of the seventh TM domain compared to GmSWEET39 in PI479752 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1009114.g002">Fig 2E</xref></bold>). However, the reading frameshift changed three amino acids in the cytoplasmic C-terminal tail that appeared to be highly conserved in legumes (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1009114.g002">Fig 2F</xref></bold>). Sequence alignment showed conservation between GmSWEET39 and two AtSWEETs (AtSWEET13, AtSWEET15) in four key amino acids that were specific to disaccharide transport [<xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], suggesting the potential role of GmSWEET39 in transporting disaccharides (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1009114.g002">Fig 2G</xref></bold>).

Interestingly, <italic>GmSWEET39</italic> was predominantly expressed in the floral bud and developing seeds (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1009114.g002">Fig 2H</xref></bold>). Briefly, the accumulation of <italic>GmSWEET39</italic> transcripts in seeds was detected as early as the globular stage and reached the highest level at the early maturation stage over the course of seed development. The transcript abundance significantly decreased after seeds reached the early maturation stage and it was undetectable in the late maturation and dry seed stages. Before the early maturation stage, transcripts of <italic>GmSWEET39</italic> began to accumulate in some subregions of the seed coat such as the inner/outer integuments during the heart and cotyledon stages (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1009114.g002">Fig 2J</xref></bold>). At the early maturation stage (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1009114.g002">Fig 2I</xref></bold>), transcripts of <italic>GmSWEET39</italic> showed a significant accumulation in subregions of the cotyledon (abaxial epidermis) and seed coat (parenchyma). Notably, the transcript abundance in the parenchyma of the seed coat at the early maturation stage was approximately 60&#x02013;400 times higher than in the abaxial epidermis and outer integument at the cotyledon stage. Expression patterns of <italic>GmSWEET39</italic> in the aforementioned compartments of developing seeds were illustrated in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1009114.g002">Fig 2K</xref></bold>. These results suggest the special role of <italic>GmSWEET39</italic> during seed development, especially in the parenchyma of the seed coat. In plants, parenchyma is the innermost part of the seed coat with direct contact with the endosperm [<xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].

Given that <italic>GmSWEET39</italic> encoded a sugar transporter that is specifically expressed in seed coat subregions during seed development, it is reasonable to presume that GmSWEET39 plays an important role in facilitating sugar transfer in the seed coat to allocate photosynthetic sucrose into the embryo and that the increased sucrose accumulation enhances the subsequent sucrose-derived fatty acid biosynthesis [<xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title><italic>GmSWEET39</italic> has been selected over soybean domestication and improvement for oil and protein improvement</title><p>We examined the indexes of selection in the 1-Mb genomic region harboring <italic>GmSWEET39</italic> using the fixation index (<italic>Fst</italic>), diversity (&#x003c0;) and Tajima&#x02019;s <italic>D</italic>.

It is still a challenge to identify causative QTL genes and DNA variants/alleles for complex traits within such large DNA regions. The recent availability of genome and transcriptome sequencing data of many diverse soybean accessions and tissues provide an opportunity to dissect those large QTL regions at a single nucleotide and gene level to discover their causative QTL genes and alleles. In this study, having fine-mapped a major protein and oil QTL to a 4-Mb region on chr15 using a bi-parental RIL linkage mapping based on SoySNP50K Chip genotyping data, we effectively pinpointed its QTL causative gene and allele to a sugar transporter gene, <italic>GmSWEET39</italic>, and a 2-bp CC deletion through an association analysis with almost all SNPs and Indels in the 4-Mb region of 631 diverse soybean accessions. The major protein and oil QTLs have been repeatedly mapped to the genomic region on chr15 and extensively investigated [<xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] in an attempt to identify their causative genes and alleles because of their high effect on protein and oil content and significance in soybean agriculture since it was first identified in the 1990s [<xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Thus, integration of high confident bi-parental genetic linkage mapping with the high-resolution association analysis of the large panel of diverse wild and domesticated soybean accessions should also offer an effective approach/platform to discover causative genes and alleles underlying other complex traits in soybean and enhance translation from phenotype- and marker-based breeding into causative gene/allele based precision breeding.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Agronomic impacts of the pleiotropic <italic>GmSWEET39</italic> on soybean seed improvement</title><p>Previous genetic studies mapped both protein and oil QTLs to the 4.0 Mb region on chr15 [<xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], whereas, whether these traits were controlled by one gene was unknown. Here, we revealed that the complex and highly correlated protein and oil traits were controlled by a single gene <italic>GmSWEET39</italic> with two major types of alleles carrying CC- and CC+ that were highly associated with high oil and high protein, respectively. Differing from the two contemporary studies locating <italic>GmSWEET39</italic> using genetic sweep-inferred approach followed by functional validation [<xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], we identified <italic>GmSWEET39</italic> and its causative allele (CC Indel) underlying the long-pursued chr15 QTL using the classic genetics and high-resolution GWAS followed by uncovering its dual role for oil and protein improvement. Uncovering the causative gene and alleles for the long-pursued chr15 QTL and the dual functions of the <italic>GmSWEET39</italic> alleles allows us to associate it tightly with soybean decades&#x02019; breeding practices and highlight its importance in increasing oil or protein during soybean domestication and improvement. Its agricultural importance was evidenced by the fixation of CC- allele in the US cultivars during the 90-year soybean breeding and its extensive uses in soybean improvement worldwide. Our study demonstrated that the H1 and H3 account for almost all variation of <italic>GmSWEET39</italic> (98.8%) in cultivated soybean and contribute to high oil and high protein respectively. It fits the pleiotropic role of chr15 QTL on seed protein and oil content as revealed in our and previous studies [<xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. It is likely that different selection pressures on H1 (CC-) and H3 (CC+), based on distinct needs for high oil, high protein soybean cultivars, consequently affected their allelic frequencies in soybean population.</p><p>The allelic analysis revealed that <italic>GmSWEET39</italic> experiences two different paths of selection, CC- allele for high oil during domestication and improvement while CC+ allele for high protein during soybean improvement, which was rarely reported in previous studies. However, artificial selection for CC- allele during domestication and improvement, in part, accounted for the decreasing trend of protein content across the transition of wild-landrace-cultivar due to its negative pleotropic effect on protein content (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1009114.g003">Fig 3B&#x02013;3D</xref></bold>). In turn, recruiting its counterpart allele (CC+) would offer an opportunity to reverse the general decline of protein content in CC- modern cultivars. For example, Brzostowski and Diers [<xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] introgressed a high-protein allele of chr15 QTL in PI407788A into two elite cultivars and showed that lines carrying chr15 QTL from PI407788A contained higher seed protein without significant yield drag compared to the recurrent parents. The Japanese cultivar Enrei contains high seed protein and has been used for breeding high-protein cultivars for soy food production to meet Japanese diet need [<xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Our result show that PI407788A and Enrei carried H3 haplotype. Therefore, H3 haplotype is an important allele that still undergoes ongoing selection at the present-day breeding for high protein content, which is in a great need of animal feed and plant-protein based diets worldwide [<xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Biased presence of H3 haplotype in cultivated soybeans suggest the haplotype likely offers additional beneficial traits to farmers than the other two haplotypes (H2, H4) if it is not caused by a biased population selection. Identification of the soybean accessions containing diverse <italic>GmSWEET39</italic> haplotypes, knowledge on selection, and distribution of the major haplotypes would allow breeders to effectively select and use appropriate haplotypes for target-based seed improvement.</p><p>It is known that oil and protein content are complex traits controlled by many genes [<xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Oil and protein content in soybean seeds could be the accumulative or epistatic effects of these QTL genes [<xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Other than <italic>GmSWEET39</italic>, other major QTLs controlling oil and protein content such as <italic>cqPro-20</italic> on chr20 (also identified in our study) and <italic>qOil_05</italic> on chr5 [<xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] may also contribute to the total phenotypic variation. We observed that oil content increase in CC-accessions over the course of soybean domestication and improvement, and protein increase in CC+ accessions during soybean improvement. In addition, higher oil and protein differences were detected between CC+ and CC- accessions of modern cultivar than of wild soybean and landrace. The increased and augmented difference likely attribute to continuous and differential integration of additional protein and oil QTLs for higher oil and protein respectively during soybean domestication and improvement. Uncovering related QTL genes and their causative DNA variants will provide a more comprehensive insight into the complex genetic basis underlying the oil and protein variation in soybean and enable us to develop effective strategies for precisely improving oil, protein or both in soybean.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title><italic>GmSWEET39</italic> likely functions as a seed coat-specific sugar transporter for seed development</title><p>It has been well demonstrated that SWEET proteins function in transporting sugar from source tissues to sink tissues [<xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Developing seed is one of the major sink organs. In seeds, cells have been differentiated into distinct tissues with diverse functions over seed development. Seed coat including outer integument and parenchyma is located at the interface between maternal seed tissues and the filial embryo, and it functions as the &#x0201c;transfer station&#x0201d; to facilitate the movement of unloaded sugar from maternal tissues to the embryo and cotyledon [<xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Evidence have demonstrated that this transporting process is mainly mediated by tissue-specific SWEET proteins in the interface tissues and those proteins are essential for seed filling. For example, in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, AtSWEET11, -12, -15 is located to the cell membrane of the seed coat [<xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The <italic>sweet11;12;15</italic> triple <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutant is defective in sugar delivery from seed coat to developing embryo, which consequently results in reduced starch and oil content and retarded embryo development [<xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Here, we demonstrated predominant expression of <italic>GmSWEET39</italic> in outer integument and parenchyma of seed coat tissues at the early maturation stage. The developmental expression of <italic>GmSWEET39</italic> was coincident with the stage when protein and lipid begin to accumulate in seeds [<xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. It should also be noted that, at the early maturation stage, <italic>GmSWEET39</italic> exhibited decreasing gradients in expression in three connected layers of tissues, from the parenchyma (seed coat) to abaxial epidermis (cotyledon) and to aleurone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1009114.g002"><bold>Fig 2J</bold> and <bold>2K</bold></xref>), which was coincident with the possible path of sugar flux from maternal seed coat to filial cotyledon [<xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Interestingly, we observed that the truncated GmSWEET39 (CC-) had a higher level of oil content, as evidenced by the H1 vs H2 comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1009114.g004"><bold>Fig 4A</bold> and <bold>4B</bold></xref>) and supported by recent reports that overexpression of the truncated GmSWEET39 increased oil in seeds [<xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that replacing or removing the C-terminal peptide of sugar transporters significantly increased the transport activity by increasing the affinity for the substrates [<xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. GmSWEET39 has ability to transport sugar [<xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and our protein structural analysis predicted that C-terminal truncation changed its cytoplasmic domain structure. It will be interesting to experimentally test if C terminus truncated GmSWEET39 can facilitate the sugar transport across the membrane. In addition, it was observed that expression of <italic>GmSWEET39</italic> positively correlated with oil content [<xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], suggesting that expression variation of <italic>GmSWEET39</italic> potentially also contribute to oil difference in soybean population. Taken together, our study suggests that GmSWEET39 is a highly-specialized protein in transporting sugar from the maternal seed coat to the filial cotyledon over course of seed development.</p><p>SWEET proteins are encoded by a large and ancient gene family in divergent plant species, and associated with diverse plant physiological and developmental processes such as disease infection, pollen growth and seed development [<xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Patil et. al [<xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] showed that soybean contains 52 <italic>GmSWEET</italic> genes that have been clustered into distinct subfamilies. Diverse expression patterns have been observed for those soybean genes, suggesting that <italic>GmSWEET</italic> gene family have been sub-functionalized with distinct expression patterns to meet diverse needs of sugar transporting for plant growth and response to environmental signals [<xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Interestingly, <italic>GmSWEET39</italic> and its orthologue <italic>AtSWEET15</italic> were both predominantly expressed in seed coat tissues and functioned in regulating oil content [<xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Arabidopsis and soybean have been diverged from each other for 90 million years [<xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The conservation of their gene expression pattern and function suggested that both <italic>SWEET</italic> genes preserved an ancient and important function in specifically transporting sugar from seed coat to filial embryo and cotyledon to support seed development and storage reserve production. Interestingly, <italic>GmSWEET15</italic> was identified by its specific expression in the seed endosperm, and silencing of it decreased 60&#x02013;70% sucrose and resulted in severe seed abortion [<xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The orthologous pair, GmSWEET39 and AtSWEET15, were clustered with <italic>GmSWEET15</italic> and <italic>AtSWEET11</italic> and <italic>12</italic> in the same subfamily [<xref rid="pgen.1009114.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This observation raises a possibility that plants have evolved an ancient <italic>SWEET</italic> subfamily to specifically express in those interface tissues to facilitate transporting sugar from maternal tissues to filial cotyledon to support seed development and seed filling. It will be interesting to examine expression patterns and functions of the other <italic>SWEET</italic> genes in the subfamily to validate the hypothesis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec013"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec id="sec014"><title>Plant materials</title><p>A RIL population consisting of 300 lines and a natural population containing 631 diverse soybean accessions were used in this study.
