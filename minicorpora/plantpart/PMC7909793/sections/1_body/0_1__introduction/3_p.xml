<p>Turmeric is considered a viable cash crop with a ready market in Alabama and in the US. Similar to any essential oil crop, turmeric’s essential oil also varies with variety, soil type, and environmental conditions [

 <xref rid="B16-foods-10-00212" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Hence, evaluating different varieties for essential content and composition is an important consideration for determining a variety for cultivation in a particular location. Turmeric is a tropical crop and grows well in warm and humid environments with mean air temperatures between 20 and 30 °C. It can be planted in all soil types, but it does best in well-drained clay loam or sandy loam soils rich in humus or organic matter with a soil pH of about 5.5 to 6.5. It grows in a wide range of climatic conditions but requires about 100 to 200 cm of rainfall a year. Thus, Alabama’s hot, humid, and rainy summer season is suited for turmeric production in the southeastern US. Furthermore, turmeric is potentially suited for catering to the herbal products industry, which prefers locally sourced materials. The purpose of the present study was to determine the variation in the essential oil chemistry of five
