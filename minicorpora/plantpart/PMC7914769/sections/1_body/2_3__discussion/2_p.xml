<p>Based on the previously determined biological properties of 
 <italic>F. macrecolea,</italic> we decided to evaluate the in vitro and ex vivo protoscolicidal effects of 
 <italic>F. macrecolea</italic> essential oil against hydatid cyst protoscoleces. The results show that FMEO had significant protoscolicidal effects compared to the control group (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). The maximum protoscolicidal activity of FMEO was observed at the concentrations of 150 and 300 µL/mL, such that 100% of the protoscoleces were killed after 30 and 20 min of exposure, respectively. The ex vivo assay showed that after adding FMEO at concentrations of 75, 150, and 300 µL/mL into hydatid cysts, the FMEO showed significant protoscolicidal effects. However, the results demonstrate that FMEO required a longer time to kill protoscoleces ex vivo.
