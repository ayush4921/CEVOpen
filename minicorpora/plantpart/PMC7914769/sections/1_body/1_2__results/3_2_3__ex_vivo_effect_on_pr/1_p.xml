<p>Based on the obtained findings, after adding FMEO at concentrations of 75, 150, and 300 ÂµL/mL into hydatid cysts, the FMEO showed significant protoscolicidal effects. However, the results demonstrate that FMEO needed more time to destroy protoscoleces ex vivo. However, there was no significant difference between the in vitro and ex vivo protoscolicidal effects of FMEO.
