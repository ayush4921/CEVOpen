  <p>
   <italic>Biomphalaria glabrata</italic> eggs and embryos exposed to essential oil from 
   <italic>Eryngium triquetrum.</italic> The data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). After 24 h of exposure to different concentrations of essential oil, egg hatching and snail development was monitored during 20 days. The term egg hatching corresponds here to a hatching leading to a normal development of the snail. This toxicity test was carried out twice on more than 25 egg masses per condition. Statistical significance was determined through Fisher exact test (
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). Asterisks indicate a significant difference between treated and non-treated eggs
