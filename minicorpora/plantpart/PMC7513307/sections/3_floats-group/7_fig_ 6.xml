  <p>Effect of 
   <italic>Eryngium triquetrum</italic> extract on 
   <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> miracidia infectivity. Prevalence of snails exposed to miracidia treated with essential oil was assessed 
   <italic>via</italic> cercarial shedding; 42 snails were individually exposed to one miracidium exposed to 0.1 or 0.5 ppm of plant extract during a short exposure (30 min). All miracidia recovered were alive and swam toward light source. Data are presented as proportions of infected snails ± standard error (
   <italic>n</italic> = 42). Statistical significance was determined through Fisherʼs exact test (
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.00001). Asterisks indicate a significant difference between treated and non-treated miracidia
