  <p>Mortality of free-swimming larvae of 
   <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> exposed to essential oil from 
   <italic>Eryngium triquetrum</italic>. Results are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD) for at least 3 and 2 independent replicates for toxicity assays against miracidia and cercariae, respectively. About 300 miracidia and 100 cercariae were used for each independent experiment. The parasites (miracidia (
   <bold>a</bold>) and cercariae (
   <bold>b</bold>)) are considered dead if not mobile or motionless at the bottom of plates. Statistical significance was determined through Fisher exact test; “a” indicates a significant difference between the treated sample and the control, “b” indicates a significant difference between 1-h treated and 4-h treated parasites
