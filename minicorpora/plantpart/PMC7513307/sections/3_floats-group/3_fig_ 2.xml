  <p>Effect of the essential oil extracted from 
   <italic>Eryngium triquetrum</italic> in snails infected with 
   <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic>. Results from 3 independent experiments are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD); 20–30 snails were submitted to different doses of essential oil. Statistical significance was determined through Fisherʼs exact test (
   <italic>P</italic> = 0.0008 and 0.0496 for comparisons at 0.5 and 0.1 ppm, respectively, between infected and uninfected snails). Asterisks indicate significant differences between uninfected and infected snails
