    <italic>Eryngium triquetrum</italic> on uninfected snails. Data are summarised as the mean and standard deviation (SD). Statistical significance was determined through Fisherʼs exact test. 
    <italic>P</italic>-value &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. A “a” indicates a significant difference between treated sample and control (Fischer’s exact test; 
    <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001); and “b” indicates a significant difference between 1 h treated and 4 h treated snails (Fisher’s exact test; 
    <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001).
