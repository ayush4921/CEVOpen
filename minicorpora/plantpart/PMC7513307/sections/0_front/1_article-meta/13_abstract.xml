  <title>Background</title>
  <p id="Par1">Freshwater snails are the intermediate hosts of a large variety of trematode flukes such as 
   <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> responsible for one of the most important parasitic diseases caused by helminths, affecting 67 million people worldwide. Recently, the WHO Global Vector Control Response 2017–2030 (GVCR) programme reinforced its message for safer molluscicides as part of required strategies to strengthen vector control worldwide. Here, we present the essential oil from 
   <italic>Eryngium triquetrum</italic> as a powerful product with molluscicide and parasiticide effect against 
   <italic>S. mansoni</italic> and the snail intermediate host 
   <italic>Biomphalaria glabrata.</italic>

  <title>Methods</title>
  <p id="Par2">In the present study, we describe using several experimental approaches, the chemical composition of 
   <italic>E. triquetrum</italic> essential oil extract and its biological effects against the snail 
   <italic>B. glabrata</italic> and its parasite 
   <italic>S. mansoni</italic>. Vector and the free-swimming larval stages of the parasite were exposed to different oil concentrations to determine the lethal concentration required to produce a mortality of 50% (LC
   <sub>50</sub>) and 90% (LC
   <sub>90</sub>). In addition, toxic activity of this essential oil was analyzed against embryos of 
   <italic>B. glabrata</italic> snails by monitoring egg hatching and snail development. Also, short-time exposure to sublethal molluscicide concentrations on 
   <italic>S. mansoni</italic> miracidia was performed to test a potential effect on parasite infectivity on snails. Mortality of miracidia and cercariae of 
   <italic>S. mansoni</italic> is complete for 5, 1 and 0.5 ppm of oil extract after 1 and 4 h exposure.

  <title>Results</title>
  <p id="Par3">The major chemical component found in 
   <italic>E. triquetrum</italic> oil determined by GC-FID and GC/MS analyses is an aliphatic polyacetylene molecule, the falcarinol with 86.9–93.1% of the total composition. The LC
   <sub>50</sub> and LC
   <sub>90</sub> values for uninfected snails were 0.61 and 1.02 ppm respectively for 24 h exposure. At 0.5 ppm, the essential oil was two times more toxic to parasitized snails with a mortality rate of 88.8 ± 4.8%. Moderate embryonic lethal effects were observed at the concentration of 1 ppm. Severe surface damage in miracidia was observed with a general loss of cilia that probably cause their immobility. Miracidia exposed 30 min to low concentration of plant extract (0.1 ppm) were less infective with 3.3% of prevalence compare to untreated with a prevalence of 44%.

  <title>Conclusions</title>
  <p id="Par4">Essential oil extracted from 
   <italic>E. triquetrum</italic> and falcarinol must be considered as a promising product for the development of new interventions for schistosomiasis control and could proceed to be tested on Phase II according to the WHO requirements.
