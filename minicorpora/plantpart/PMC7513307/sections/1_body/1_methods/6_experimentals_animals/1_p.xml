 <italic>Biomphalaria glabrata</italic> originating from Recife, Brazil (BgBRE2), was used for this study. These snails were maintained in rearing chambers at 26 °C, 12:12 h light:dark photoperiod and fed 
 <italic>ad libitum</italic> with fresh lettuce. A Puerto Rican strain (NMRI) of 
 <italic>S. mansoni</italic> was used in this study to determine the effects of molluscicide on the susceptibility of infected snails and host-parasite compatibility.
