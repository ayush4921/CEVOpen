<p id="Par34">The eradication of schistosomiasis provided by the WHO’s road map and planned for 2030 requires a significant investment from all disciplinary fields to develop new drugs against human schistosomes and to interrupt the parasite life-cycle. Even if the study of biological interactions between 
 <italic>Schistosoma</italic> and its snail vector has taken a new dimension based on their genome sequencing studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], the CRISPR production of parasite-resistant transgenic snails or genetically modified sterile worms are quite far from having any results because of technical difficulties and little-known ecological aspects of such releases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Currently, massive treatment with praziquantel and improving sanitation appear the best way to control the disease. However, new foci are appearing, and other are re-emerging probably due to global warming [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] and mass human migration [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], but also to the emergence of drug-tolerant schistosomes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. In this context, snail control appears to be a crucial strategy to ensure a sustainable control and elimination of schistosomiasis. A number of molluscicides have been developed in an attempt to decrease parasitic disease transmission. Among synthetic molluscicides, niclosamide is the most widely employed in official schistosomiasis control programmes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] although concerns about the emergence of resistant snail population remains [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and its apparent toxicity to other living organisms has been observed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. In addition, it is often necessary to repeat spraying in treated transmission sites due to snail repopulation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Consequently, increasing efforts focused on identifying and characterizing new plant-derived molluscicides is required as a safer alternative [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Among the molluscicidal agents extracted from plants, the latex from 
 <italic>Euphorbia</italic> sp. appears promising by acting on both the snail vector and the parasite [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The LC
 <sub>50</sub> can depend on several parameters such as 
 <italic>Euphorbia</italic> species, the different part of the plant or the solvent used for latex extraction [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. For example, LC
 <sub>50</sub> of latex extracted from 
 <italic>E. umbellata</italic> range from 1.36 to 40 ppm [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] and around 30 ppm and 0.5 from 
 <italic>E. tirucalli</italic> and 
 <italic>E. splendens</italic>, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Others plant extracts also display molluscicidal activities at concentrations lower that the one required by the WHO. Alcoholic stem extract from 
 <italic>Jatropha gossypiifolia</italic> shows toxicity towards adult snails after 24 h exposure with a LC
 <sub>50</sub> of 25 ppm [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Chlorophyllin extracted from 
 <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> leaves has a lethal activity on adults 
 <italic>Biomphalaria</italic> snails exposed during 24 h probably by interfering with nervous and digestive systems [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. A 
 <italic>Camellia oleifera</italic> extract enriched in saponin exhibits a high level of toxicity against adult 
 <italic>B. alexandrina</italic> snails for which LC
 <sub>50</sub> is quite similar to niclosamide, used as reference [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Other plant-derived terpenes such as jatrophone have also a high toxicity against adult snails [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. This list of plant-derived extracts with a potential molluscicidal activity is far from being exhaustive. Moreover, a recent review updates the different essential oils used for their toxic effect against schistosomiasis transmitting snails [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. The most studied plants are those belonging to families Lamiacae, Rutaceae and Myrtaceae. The major chemical components determined by chromatography analyses are the terpenic derivatives for which their concentration in oils depend strongly on the nature of organic solvent and the different parts of plants used [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. To our knowledge, the present study is the first to report the molluscicidal and parasiticidal activities of an essential oil extracted from an Apiaciae, 
 <italic>Eryngium triquetrum</italic>. Its biological activities can be assigned to the high falcarinol content (about 90%), an aliphatic polyacetylene molecule produced by several plants such as carrots [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Interestingly, the high level of this component is only found in 
 <italic>E. triquetrum</italic> and could be considered as a main source of production. Indeed, essential oils of 
 <italic>Eryngium</italic> species such as 
 <italic>E. campestre</italic>, 
 <italic>E. maritimum</italic> or 
 <italic>E. alpinum</italic> do not contain such falcarinol compound or at lower concentrations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. As for 
 <italic>E. planum</italic>, the maximal rate of falcarinol (about 60%) is concentrated in roots which make it difficult to benefit from its biological activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. As 
 <italic>E. triquetrum</italic> from Algeria is a falcarinol-rich essential oil, especially from stems, exploitation at large farming scale could be proposed for molluscicidal but also therapeutic application. Indeed, falcarinol and/or essential oil from 
 <italic>E. triquetrum</italic> display antimicrobial effect as well as anti-inflammatory properties [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Also, falcarinol could be used in tumor treatment since cytotoxic activity against human cancer cell lines has been demonstrated [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>].
