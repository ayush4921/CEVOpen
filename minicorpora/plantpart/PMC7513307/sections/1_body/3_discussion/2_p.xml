<p id="Par35">In the present study, the essential oil from 
 <italic>E. triquetrum</italic> seems to be a promising molluscicidal candidate considering the standard criteria established by the WHO with a lethal concentration of 90% and 50% below 400 and 100 ppm respectively. The LC
 <sub>90</sub> and LC
 <sub>50</sub> values against adult 
 <italic>B. glabrata</italic> snails of 1.02 and 0.61 ppm, respectively, are significantly lower than most of the well-characterized essential oils and similar to latex or niclosamide. Unlike the reference molluscicide, the lower toxicity of the essential oil from 
 <italic>E. triquetrum</italic> to embryonated eggs potentially due to a low penetrating ability into egg masses, suggests a higher specificity of action towards adult snails. This toxic dichotomy can be useful to treat the aquatic environment while reducing the side effects on non-target animals. The disruption of parasiteâ€™s life-cycle is more favored when snails are even early infected. This higher mortality in infected snails could be linked to a broad dysregulation of signaling pathways involved in detoxification [
