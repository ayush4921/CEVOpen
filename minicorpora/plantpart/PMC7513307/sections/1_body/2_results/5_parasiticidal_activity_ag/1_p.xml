<p id="Par33">An alternative approach in control of schistosomiasis instead of controlling the snail population could be to focus on the free-swimming larval stages of the parasite, miracidia and cercariae. These parasite larval stages were exposed for 1 or 4 h to different concentrations of 
 <italic>E. triquetrum</italic> extract ranging from 0.1 to 1 ppm to evaluate its potential lethal effect. The mortality of the miracidia and cercariae of 
 <italic>S. mansoni</italic> was nearly complete for 5, 1 and 0.5 ppm of oil extract irrespective of the exposure time. For a concentration of 0.1 ppm, the mortality rate of miracidia dropped considerably reaching 7.6 ± 2.7% and 29.3 ± 8.0% with 1 and 4 hours of exposure (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). After a relatively short exposure time, severe surface damage on miracidia can be observed with a general loss of cilia that probably cause their immobility (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The mortality pattern for exposed cercariae was quite similar with 4.6 ± 3.6% and 15.6 ± 5.8% of deaths observed after the different contact times (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). To determine the ability of exposed miracidia to infect their host, sublethal concentrations of the essential oil from 
 <italic>E. triquetrum</italic> were applied for 30 min. Results of the snail exposure to treated 
 <italic>S. mansoni</italic> miracidia are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>. Miracidia exposed to low concentrations of plant extract were less infective with a prevalence of 3.3% compared to untreated miracidia (prevalence of 44%).
