0: In order to further analyze the biological activity of  E. triquetrum, we characterize and investigate the toxic effects of its essential oil against  S. mansoni free-swimming stages (miracidia and cercariae) and on adults and embryos of the snail  B. glabrata.
1: Our results suggest that this biological compound could be used as a biological control agent against  B. glabrata snails and its parasite  S. mansoni.
