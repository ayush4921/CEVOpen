<p id="Par13">In order to further analyze the biological activity of 
 <italic>E. triquetrum</italic>, we characterize and investigate the toxic effects of its essential oil against 
 <italic>S. mansoni</italic> free-swimming stages (miracidia and cercariae) and on adults and embryos of the snail 
 <italic>B. glabrata</italic>. Our results suggest that this biological compound could be used as a biological control agent against 
 <italic>B. glabrata</italic> snails and its parasite
