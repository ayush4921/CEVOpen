<p>The rhizomes of the three 
 <italic>C. amada</italic> (ZO45, ZO89, and ZO114) and one 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> (ZO138) accessions were used as plant materials to conduct the current study. 
 <italic>Curcuma</italic> species were obtained from Myanmar under the Myanmar–Japan cooperative project for the exploration and utilization of the plant genetic resources in Myanmar. The plant material was transferred to Japan via the Standard Material Transfer Agreement (SMTA) under the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA), the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (UN FAO) [

The candidate rhizomes were planted in plastic pots of 30 × 50 cm (diameter × height) containing 2–3 cm of big granular soil (Akadama Churyu, Kato Sangyo Co., Nishinomiya, Japan) at the bottom of pot and ready to use a pre-mixed soil (Hana to Yasai no Bayo Do, Kato Sangyo Co., Nishinomiya, Japan) as a growth medium. Pots were arranged in the experimental field of the Gene Research Center, University of Tsukuba, Japan (36°6′0 N latitude and 140°6′0 E longitude). The plant materials were grown in three biological replications and were fertilized every four weeks by liquid fertilizer (HYPONeX Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan) consisting of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in the ratio of 6:10:5 (N:P:K).
