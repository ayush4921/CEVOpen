<p>The compounds were identified according to the guideline for metabolite identification [
 <xref rid="B56-metabolites-11-00021" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. To identify similar or very similar compounds from the referenced libraries, the similarity index greater than ≥800 with the RI differences less than &lt;30 unit was applied. When the standard deviation (SD) of the absolute RI difference between the compounds was less than 8.8 units, a similarity of ≥799 with differences less than 20 units were applied to determine whether peaks were from a putatively annotated compound.
