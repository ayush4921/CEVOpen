<p>The data processing and provisional VOC identification were done according to Kusano et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-metabolites-11-00021" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] with modifications. The non-processed MS data were transformed into the NetCDF format using Leco ChromaTOF version 4.71.0.0 (LECO, St. Joseph, MI, USA) and MATLAB 7.0 (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA). The data-pretreatment procedures such as baseline correction, smoothing, peak alignment, time-window setting, and deconvolution by the hierarchical multi-curve resolution (H-MCR) were performed on MATLAB 7.0 (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA) [
