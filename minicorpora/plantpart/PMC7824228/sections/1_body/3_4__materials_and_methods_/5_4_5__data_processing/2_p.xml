<p>The adjusted mass spectra obtained by the H-MCR method [
 <xref rid="B57-metabolites-11-00021" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] were matched against those reference mass spectra reported in the commercial libraries by using the NIST version 2.0 mass spectral search program and the customized peak annotation software following Kusano et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-metabolites-11-00021" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The referenced libraries used for the VOC identification were Wileyâ€™s FFNSC3 library, the Adams library [
 <xref rid="B25-metabolites-11-00021" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], the Terpenoids library [
 <xref rid="B26-metabolites-11-00021" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], the VocBinBase Library [
 <xref rid="B27-metabolites-11-00021" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and the NIST14 [
 <xref rid="B28-metabolites-11-00021" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].
