<p>The 
 <italic>Curcuma</italic> rhizomes were harvested on 17 October 2018, when the night/day temperature was +15–+20 °C. The collected rhizomes were carefully washed and cleaned under tap water to remove soil residues, and dried in a paper towel in dark condition for approximately 30 min. Then, rhizomes were chopped into slices of 1.0 cm using stainless steel surgical blades (Feather Safety Razor Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan). About 15 g of chopped rhizome samples were transferred to a homogenization tube and stored at −80 °C for future processing. The rhizomes pieces were cryohomogenized into powder in a Multi-beads Shocker MB2000 (Yasui Kikai Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan) at 2800 rpm for 16 s.
