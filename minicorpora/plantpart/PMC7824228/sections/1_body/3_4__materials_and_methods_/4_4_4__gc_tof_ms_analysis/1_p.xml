<p>The collected volatile fractions were injected in splitless mode into a 6890N Agilent GC (Agilent Technologies, Wilmington, NC, USA), which was equipped with a Rxi-5Sil MS fused-silica capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm inner diameter × 0.25 μm, RESTEK, Bellefonte, PA, USA). Helium was used as carrier gas at a constant flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The programmed GC oven temperature started at 55 °C for 3 min, then increased to 150 °C at the rate of 15 °C/min, then increased to 200 °C at the rate of 3 °C/min with a final hold at 200 °C for 2 min. The back inlet temperature was kept at 250 °C. The mass spectral analysis was done on time-of-flight mass spectrometer Pegasus III 4D TOF-MS (LECO, MI, USA). The mass spectral ionization energy was 70 eV with an ionization source temperature set on 200 °C. The MS scan range (
