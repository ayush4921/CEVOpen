<p>Investigation of the phytochemical composition in 
 <italic>C. amada</italic> has attracted increasing interest due to its nutritional and pharmacological significance [
 <xref rid="B11-metabolites-11-00021" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. More than 150 compounds have been reported in 
 <italic>C. amada</italic> essential oil obtained by hydro- or steam distillation of the fresh or dry rhizome [

 <xref rid="B15-metabolites-11-00021" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The VOCs in 
 <italic>C. amada</italic> are vital, not merely due to their biological activity but are important both for taxonomic research and for understanding the interaction of plants with each other and with the environment [
 <xref rid="B16-metabolites-11-00021" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, studies are meager on the profiling of 
 <italic>C. amada</italic> VOCs from the fresh rhizome. In addition, the taxonomic study of 
 <italic>C. amada</italic> and 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> remains difficult if only based on the morphological descriptions [
