0: Investigation of the phytochemical composition in  C. amada has attracted increasing interest due to its nutritional and pharmacological significance [ 11].
1: More than 150 compounds have been reported in  C. amada essential oil obtained by hydro- or steam distillation of the fresh or dry rhizome [ 9, 13, 14, 15].
2: The VOCs in  C. amada are vital, not merely due to their biological activity but are important both for taxonomic research and for understanding the interaction of plants with each other and with the environment [ 16].
3: However, studies are meager on the profiling of  C. amada VOCs from the fresh rhizome.
4: In addition, the taxonomic study of  C. amada and  C. longa remains difficult if only based on the morphological descriptions [ 11].
