<p>Plant volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are a relatively large group of plant secondary metabolites accumulated naturally and involved in plantsâ€™ interaction with their environment [

 <xref rid="B2-metabolites-11-00021" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The emission of VOCs from plants has strong relevance to plant physiological processes, plant ecology, and atmosphere chemistry [
 <xref rid="B3-metabolites-11-00021" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. More than 1700 VOCs have been identified over the years from 90 different plant families [
 <xref rid="B1-metabolites-11-00021" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. They are divided into several classes including terpenoids, benzenoids and phenylpropanoids, fatty acid derivatives, amino acid derivatives, C5-branched compounds, and various nitrogen and sulfur-containing compounds in addition to a few species-/genus-specific compounds not represented in those major classes [
