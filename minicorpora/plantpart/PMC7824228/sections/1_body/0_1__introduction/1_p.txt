0: Plant volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are a relatively large group of plant secondary metabolites accumulated naturally and involved in plants interaction with their environment [ 1, 2].
1: The emission of VOCs from plants has strong relevance to plant physiological processes, plant ecology, and atmosphere chemistry [ 3].
2: More than 1700 VOCs have been identified over the years from 90 different plant families [ 1].
3: They are divided into several classes including terpenoids, benzenoids and phenylpropanoids, fatty acid derivatives, amino acid derivatives, C5-branched compounds, and various nitrogen and sulfur-containing compounds in addition to a few species-/genus-specific compounds not represented in those major classes [ 4, 5].
