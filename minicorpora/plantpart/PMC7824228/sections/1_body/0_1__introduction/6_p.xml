<p>The objective of the present study was the analysis of VOC profiles of three 
 <italic>C. amada</italic> (ZO45, ZO89, and ZO114) and one 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> (ZO138) accessions by means of HS-SPME coupled with GC-TOF-MS technique. The HS-SPME GC-TOF-MS approach can be a simple, fast, solvent-free, reproducible, and comprehensive metabolite profiling method for 
 <italic>Curcuma</italic> species with a small amount of samples (50 Âµg/mL) to be used. 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> has been used as a control sample for comparative characterization of the VOCs since phytochemical constituents of this species were better studied and reported [
 <xref rid="B12-metabolites-11-00021" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. To our current knowledge, this is the first report for the VOC profiling of 
 <italic>C. amada</italic> using the HS-GC-TOF-MS analysis.
