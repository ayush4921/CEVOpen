0: The objective of the present study was the analysis of VOC profiles of three  C. amada (ZO45, ZO89, and ZO114) and one  C. longa (ZO138) accessions by means of HS-SPME coupled with GC-TOF-MS technique.
1: The HS-SPME GC-TOF-MS approach can be a simple, fast, solvent-free, reproducible, and comprehensive metabolite profiling method for  Curcuma species with a small amount of samples (50 g/mL) to be used.
2: C. longa has been used as a control sample for comparative characterization of the VOCs since phytochemical constituents of this species were better studied and reported [ 12].
3: To our current knowledge, this is the first report for the VOC profiling of  C. amada using the HS-GC-TOF-MS analysis.
