0: The metabolite profiling requires methods that facilitate the identification and quantification of hundreds of metabolites in a single or a complex plant mixture.
1: Several approaches such as gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS) have been established as highly accurate and sensitive methods for the analysis of highly complex mixtures of compounds [ 17].
2: Furthermore, the sample preparation techniques also play a vital role in achieving higher optimal results and obtaining consistent data in the later stages of analysis [ 18].
3: The simple and appropriate sample preparation method using small amounts of samples are expected for the precision and improvement of VOCs analysis.
4: The headspace (HS) sampling method, as a solvent-free sample preparation technique, has been playing a fundamental role in studying the composition of the volatile fractions emitted from plants [ 19, 20].
5: The solid-phase microextraction (SPME) technique has been proved for quick screening of VOCs in a wide range of products with the possibility to isolate trace compounds of different substrates [ 21, 22].
6: Thus, the HS-SPME method can be used to extract multifarious volatile or semi-volatile organic compounds from a wide range of matrices, including air, water, and soil, which has been reported two decades ago [ 21].
7: Recently, the HS-SPME approach has widely been applied in the phytochemical study of plant species such as  Raphanus sativus,  Brassica juncea [ 23],  Cannabis sativa L. among others [ 24].
