<p>The PCA score plot of the VOC profile data showed species-dependent differentiation resulting from the separation group of 
 <italic>C. amada</italic> samples from a group of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> samples in the different quadrants of the generated plot (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-11-00021-f001">Figure 1</xref>a). The group of 
 <italic>C. amada</italic> samples—accessions ZO45, ZO89, and ZO114—was scattered between lower and upper negative/positive quadrants, while the group of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> samples—accession ZO138—was situated in a lower negative quadrant of the plot (
