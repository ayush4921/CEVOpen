<p>In total, 373 mass spectral (MS) peaks were obtained as a data matrix in the VOC profile of the 24 analyzed samples (three biological and two technical replicates for each accession). The obtained MS peaks were provisionally identified following Kusano et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-metabolites-11-00021" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The similarity of each MS peaks and their retention indices (RIs) were compared with those reported in the corresponding libraries, i.e., the Flavors and Fragrance of Natural and Synthetic Compounds (FFNSC3) library, the Adams library [
 <xref rid="B25-metabolites-11-00021" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], the Terpenoids library [
 <xref rid="B26-metabolites-11-00021" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], the VocBinBase library [
 <xref rid="B27-metabolites-11-00021" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and the NIST14 [
 <xref rid="B28-metabolites-11-00021" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. As a result, 122 VOCs were tentatively identified comprising 32.7% of the rhizome volatile composition out of 373 detected mass spectra.
