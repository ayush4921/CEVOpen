<p>The distribution of the identified major VOCs in the profiles of 
 <italic>C. amada</italic> and 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> accessions was investigated by performing the PCA loading plot. Among the annotated VOCs some were highlighted in the PCA loading plot as representative compounds that contributed to the separation of the two species, i.e., 
 <italic>C. amada</italic> and 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-11-00021-f001">Figure 1</xref>b). In 
 <italic>C. amada</italic> samples, the compounds such as β-myrcene [ID071], o-cymol [ID089], 1,8-cineole [ID099], camphor [ID152], γ-curcumene [ID275], cuparene [ID276], α-zingiberene [ID280], β-sesquiphellandrene [ID289], 
 <italic>ar</italic>-turmerone [ID349], and (
 <italic>E</italic>)-γ-atlantone [ID357] were detected at relatively high level (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-metabolites-11-00021">Table S1</xref>). The VOCs like β-elemene [ID247], α-funebrene [ID250], α-santalene [ID257], 
 <italic>trans</italic>-α-bergamotene [ID260], teresantalol [ID261], α-santalol [ID270], and β-bisabolene [ID283] were found in abundance in 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> sample (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-11-00021-f001">Figure 1</xref>b). The result was consistent with significant differences between these species as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-metabolites-11-00021">Supplementary Table S1</xref>.
