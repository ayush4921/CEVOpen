<p>We compared the metabolite profile of three 
 <italic>C. amada</italic> and one 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> accessions to investigate whether the VOC composition of these two closely related species can be used in their differentiation. The significant differences of tentatively identified VOCs in the HS of samples were analyzed by Tukey’s HSD test from the average normalized value of six replicates per sample. The similarities and differences were observed regarding identified VOCs within 
 <italic>C. amada</italic> accessions, as well as between 
 <italic>C. amada</italic> and 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> accessions (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-metabolites-11-00021">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). In total, 74 VOCs were significantly different, out of which 30 compounds were found to be significantly different between 
 <italic>C. amada</italic> and 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> accessions, and 54 compounds were significantly different among three 
 <italic>C. amada</italic> accessions, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-metabolites-11-00021">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). One compound 
 <italic>cis</italic>-α-bergamotene was not detected in 
 <italic>C. amada</italic> accessions ZO45 and ZO89. The degree of the VOC changes was correlated with the result obtained by PCA analysis (
