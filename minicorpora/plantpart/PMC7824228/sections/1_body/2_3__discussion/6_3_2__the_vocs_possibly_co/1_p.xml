 <italic>C. amada</italic> commonly known as the “mango ginger” or “manga manjal” [
 <xref rid="B9-metabolites-11-00021" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] due to its aroma of raw mango and many attempts were made to identify the compounds contributing to this notable feature. The compounds pinene, δ-3-carene, (
 <italic>Z</italic>)-β-ocimene, and myrcene (β-myrcene) were reported [

 <xref rid="B51-metabolites-11-00021" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] to contribute for the characteristic mango odor in 
 <italic>C. amada</italic> rhizome. We did not detect these compounds in the current study, although the assessed 
 <italic>C. amada</italic> accessions displayed light mango aroma. Whilst compounds such as hexanal, beta-myrcene, terpinolene, nonanal, (
 <italic>E</italic>)-2-nonenal, decanal, and beta-caryophyllene reported as key contributors to the mango aroma in mango fruits [
 <xref rid="B52-metabolites-11-00021" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,
 <xref rid="B53-metabolites-11-00021" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,
 <xref rid="B54-metabolites-11-00021" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], we presume the above-mentioned compounds may also contribute to the mango aroma in studied 
 <italic>C. amada</italic> accessions.
