<p>It is apparent that many of the identified substances are reported to possess various potentially biological activities in 
 <italic>Curcuma</italic> species. The major compounds detected in this study that were previously reported [
 <xref rid="B13-metabolites-11-00021" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14-metabolites-11-00021" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34-metabolites-11-00021" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] with therapeutic effect were α-zingiberene and 
 <italic>ar</italic>-turmerone. The 
 <italic>ar</italic>-turmerone as a natural antibiotic possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, and immune-activating properties [
 <xref rid="B35-metabolites-11-00021" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]; it is used as an insecticidal and repellent agent in crop industries [
 <xref rid="B36-metabolites-11-00021" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], as a potent anti-venom against snakebites in traditional medicine, and as an agent to enhance stem-cell proliferation [
 <xref rid="B35-metabolites-11-00021" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The 
 <italic>cis</italic>-α-bergamotene was detected in 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> and 
 <italic>Zingiber officinale</italic> (common ginger), contributing to the antioxidant and antimicrobial properties [
 <xref rid="B37-metabolites-11-00021" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="B38-metabolites-11-00021" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. It was also reported in the plant defense studies as one of the most abundant VOC in the HS of high-nitrogen and low-nitrogen plants and the release of which was not affected by nitrogen limitation [
 <xref rid="B39-metabolites-11-00021" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="B40-metabolites-11-00021" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The monoterpene 
 <italic>o</italic>-cymol reported in the essential oils of several species has antifungal activity [
 <xref rid="B41-metabolites-11-00021" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="B42-metabolites-11-00021" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="B43-metabolites-11-00021" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,
 <xref rid="B44-metabolites-11-00021" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The compound α-humulene (α-caryophyllene), reported in other 
 <italic>Curcuma</italic> species, has the antimicrobial activity [
 <xref rid="B45-metabolites-11-00021" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,
 <xref rid="B46-metabolites-11-00021" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The γ-curcumene was mainly reported in 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> as an antioxidant agent [
 <xref rid="B37-metabolites-11-00021" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="B47-metabolites-11-00021" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Furthermore, 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol was reported as a promising compound with antioxidant and antifungal activities [
 <xref rid="B48-metabolites-11-00021" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Beta-sesquiphellandrene has antioxidant and antimicrobial activities reported in other Zingiberaceae species [
 <xref rid="B49-metabolites-11-00021" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,
 <xref rid="B50-metabolites-11-00021" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].
