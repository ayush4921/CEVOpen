<p>The identification of the VOC profile in the rhizomes of three 
 <italic>C. amada</italic> (ZO45, ZO89 and ZO114) and 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> (ZO138) accessions were carried out by application of the non-targeted GC-TOF-MS method. Each compound was identified by comparing its RIs, determined with respect to a homologous series of normal alkanes, and by matching the recorded mass spectra of each compound by the degree of its similarity with those reported in the commercial libraries, allowing to detect qualitative differences between the analyzed samples. In total, 122 VOCs were identified in the VOC profile of two studied 
 <italic>Curcuma</italic> species. The result corresponds with those reported by Qudah et al. [
 <xref rid="B30-metabolites-11-00021" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] that more than 130 chemical constituents have been reported in the rhizome of 
 <italic>C. amada</italic>, but only 121 compounds have been tentatively identified.
