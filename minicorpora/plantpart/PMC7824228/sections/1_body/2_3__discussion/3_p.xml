<p>In the present study, α-zingiberene, β-sesquiphellandrene, and cuparene were the major compounds characterized in the VOC profile of three 
 <italic>C. amada</italic> accessions, and α-santalene, cuparene, β-bisabolene, and teresantalol were the main compounds in the VOC profile of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> accession from Myanmar. The certain volatile compounds were inherent and special only in distinctive 
 <italic>Curcuma</italic> species. For instance, 
 <italic>ar</italic>-turmerone (57.48%) is the main compound characteristic of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> rhizome oil [

 <xref rid="B32-metabolites-11-00021" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]; curdione (50.6%), camphor (35.8%), camphene (10.2%), and 1,8-cineole (10.1%) are reported as major constituents in rhizome oil of 
 <italic>C. aromatica</italic> [
 <xref rid="B9-metabolites-11-00021" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-metabolites-11-00021" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]; 
 <italic>C. zedoaria</italic> rhizome oil is consisted mainly of 1,8-cineole (38.4%), epicurzerene (29.4%), and α-copaene (17.4%) as a major one among the others [
 <xref rid="B6-metabolites-11-00021" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Our result showed that the intensity of 
 <italic>ar</italic>-turmerone was high in 
 <italic>C. amada</italic> accession ZO89 and was significantly different compared to 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> or two other 
 <italic>C. amada</italic> accessions. It is well-known that the extent of each volatile constituent varies depending on species/cultivars and cultivation conditions such as weather, irrigation, soil type, pests. We suggest the observed variation probably was related to the defensive function of VOCs, which improves plant resistance efficiency either to biotic or abiotic stresses.
