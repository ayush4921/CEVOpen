  <italic>Curcuma amada</italic> Roxb. (Zingiberaceae), commonly known as mango ginger because its rhizome and foliar parts have a similar aroma to mango. The rhizome has been widely used in food industries and alternative medicines to treat a variety of internal diseases such as cough, bronchitis, indigestion, colic, loss of appetite, hiccups, and constipation. The composition of the volatile constituents in a fresh rhizome of 
  <italic>C. amada</italic> is not reported in detail. The present study aimed to screen and characterize the composition of volatile organic compound (VOC) in a fresh rhizome of three 
  <italic>C. amada</italic> (ZO45, ZO89, and ZO114) and one 
  <italic>C. longa</italic> (ZO138) accessions originated from Myanmar. The analysis was carried out by means of headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) coupled with gas chromatography-time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS). As a result, 122 VOCs were tentatively identified from the extracted 373 mass spectra. The following compounds were the ten most highly abundant and broadly present ones: 
  <italic>ar</italic>-turmerone, α-zingiberene, α-santalene, (
  <italic>E</italic>)-γ-atlantone, cuparene, β-bisabolene, teresantalol, β-sesquiphellandrene, 
  <italic>trans</italic>-α-bergamotene, γ-curcumene. The intensity of 
  <italic>ar</italic>-turmerone, the sesquiterpene which is mainly characterized in 
  <italic>C. longa</italic> essential oil (up to 15.5–27.5%), was significantly higher in 
  <italic>C. amada</italic> accession ZO89 (15.707 ± 5.78
  <sup>a</sup>) compared to 
  <italic>C. longa</italic> accession ZO138 (0.300 ± 0.08
  <sup>b</sup>). 
  <italic>Cis</italic>-α-bergamotene was not detected in two 
  <italic>C. amada</italic> accessions ZO45 and ZO89. The study revealed between-species variation regarding identified VOCs in the fresh rhizome of 
  <italic>C. amada</italic> and 
  <italic>C. longa</italic>.
