<p id="Par82">Ten grams of powdered seeds were weighed and transferred to a 500-mL round-bottom flask. Then, 130 ml n-hexane at a 1:13 ratio (g·mL
 <sup>− 1</sup>) was added to the flask. The flask was connected to a condenser tube and placed in the ultrasonic cleaning machine (KQ-200VDB, Kunshan ultrasonic instrument co., LTD, China) to perform oil extraction at 70 °C and 200 W at a fixed frequency of 80 KHz. After extraction for 1.5 h, the mixture was centrifuged at room temperature for 10 min at 4000 r·min
 <sup>− 1</sup>. The supernatant was separated and dried under the rotary evaporator (RE52–99, Yarong biochemical instrument factory, Shanghai, China) at 55 °C for oil separation and n-hexane recovery. The oil was then stored in a refrigerator (4 °C) until fatty acid analysis. The oil content was calculated and expressed as % (oil weight/seed weight).
