<p id="Par81">Seeds of herbaceous peony ‘Hangshao’ were collected from the same plant which was introduced from Pan’an County Zhejiang Province (traditional Chinese medicine ‘Radix Paeoniae Alba’ production base), identified by Yang-Qian Cao, a senior agronomist from Heze Peony Research Institure in Shangdong Province of China, and cultivated in the peony germplasm resource garden of Yangzhou University, China (32°39′N, 119°42′E) for 8 years. Due to the limited fruit and low oil extraction rate at the early stage, the follicle was hand-collected in the 30 days after flowering (DAF) for the first time and at intervals of 15 days until full maturity (including 30, 45, 60, 75 and 90 DAF) for fatty acid absolute content analysis by GC-MS (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). Seeds used for transcriptome sequencing were collected from the same strain at developmental stages of 30, 60 and 90 DAF. The collected samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in a − 80 °C cryogenic refrigerator until further use.
