<p id="Par94">qRT-PCR was introduced to analyze gene transcript levels with BIO-RAD CFX Connect™ Optics Module (Bio-Rad, USA). Extracted seeds RNA (1 μg) were reverse-transcribed into cDNA in a 10-μl reaction based on the superscript first-strand synthesis system (PrimeScript® RT Reagent Kit With gDNA Eraser, TaKaRa, Japan).

 <xref rid="MOESM15" ref-type="media">15</xref>: Table S12. SYBR® Premix Ex Taq™ (Perfect Real Time) was used for qRT-PCR (TaKaRa, Japan). The PCR cycles were as follows: 55 °C for 2 min, followed by an initial denaturation step at 95 °C for 30 s, 40 cycles at 95 °C for 5 s, 55 °C for 15 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. 2
 <sup>-ΔΔCt</sup> comparative threshold cycle (Ct) method was used for calculation of relative expression levels [
