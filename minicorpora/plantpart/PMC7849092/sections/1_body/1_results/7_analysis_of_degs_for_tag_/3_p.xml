<p id="Par70">The heat maps of the abovementioned DEGs are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>. We found that most of the DEGs had relatively low expression levels, which appear blue in the heat map, and a small number of them were highly expressed, which appear read in the heat map, including 4 
 <italic>KAR</italic>, 1 
 <italic>KCR</italic>, 2 
 <italic>SAD</italic>, 4 
 <italic>FAD3</italic>, 6 
 <italic>OLE</italic> and 1 
 <italic>CLO</italic>. In addition, we analyzed the number and attribution of DEGs in each group (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM13" ref-type="media">13</xref>: Table S10). In Group I, 76 DEGs, including 17 upregulated and 59 downregulated DEGs, were divided into 32 DEGs in the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway, 15 DEGs in the fatty acid elongation pathway, 13 DEGs in the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acid pathway, 8 DEGs in the TAG assembly pathway, and 8 DEGs in the lipid storage pathway. In Group II, 90 DEGs, including 28 upregulated and 62 downregulated DEGs, were divided into 26 DEGs in the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway, 26 DEGs in the fatty acid elongation pathway, 24 DEGs in the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acid pathway, 12 DEGs in the TAG assembly pathway, and 2 DEGs in the lipid storage pathway. In Group III, 118 DEGs, including 32 upregulated and 86 downregulated DEGs, were divided into 39 DEGs in the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway, 30 DEGs in the fatty acid elongation pathway, 24 DEGs in the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acid pathway, 16 DEGs in the TAG assembly pathway, and 9 DEGs in the lipid storage pathway. Moreover, we found 47 DEGs in all three groups (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, marked as *), among which 33 DEGs were downregulated, including 
 <italic>BC</italic> (3), 
 <italic>α-CT</italic> (2), 
 <italic>BCCP</italic> (3), 
 <italic>HAD</italic> (3), 
 <italic>EAR</italic> (3), 
 <italic>KASII</italic> (3), 
 <italic>KCS</italic> (3), 
 <italic>KCR</italic> (2), 
 <italic>HCD</italic> (1), 
 <italic>ECR</italic> (1), 
 <italic>FAD2</italic>(5), 
 <italic>FAD3</italic>(3) and 
 <italic>PDCT</italic> (1); only 1 DEG was upregulated belonging to 
 <italic>KAR</italic>, and the other 13 DEGs were upregulated in one group or downregulated in another group.
