<p id="Par55">The oil content of herbaceous peony ‘Hangshao’ seeds at five different stages was studied. It was approximately 5.06%±0.06% at 30 DAF, and it increased constantly, reaching a maximum of 20.92%±0.25% at 75 DAF and then slightly decreasing at 90 DAF (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). Five main fatty acids, PA, SA, OA, LA and ALA, were detected by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of the fatty acid components of the seeds from the herbaceous peony ‘Hangshao’. Through quantitative analysis of the contents of five fatty acids (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c), it was found that the content of ALA, LA and PA showed a trend toward first rising and then falling during seed development, and the maximum value appeared in the S4 period. In contrast, the content of OA and SA increased consistently during seed development, and the maximum value appeared in the S5 period. However, the absolute contents of the five fatty acids in the five periods showed that the ALA content was highest and the SA content was lowest, and the contents followed the order ALA &gt; LA &gt; OA &gt; PA &gt; SA. The total contents of the five fatty acids from S1 to S5 seeds were 4.49 g·100 g
 <sup>− 1</sup>, 12.17 g·100 g
 <sup>− 1</sup>, 21.19 g·100 g
 <sup>− 1</sup>, 26.11 g·100 g
 <sup>− 1</sup> and 24.75 g·100 g
 <sup>− 1</sup>. Moreover, the content of ALA exceeded 10 g·100 g
 <sup>− 1</sup> in both the S4 and S5 stages.
