<p id="Par71">We identified 17 
 <italic>BCCP</italic> genes in 
 <italic>Paeonia lactiflora</italic> ‘Hangshao’ from transcriptome database, and the gene sequences were available in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM14" ref-type="media">14</xref>: Table S11. To further analyze the diversity of BCCP protein in 
 <italic>P. lactiflora</italic> ‘Hangshao’, we used MEME to analyze the conservative motif. Generally speaking, proteins clustered in a family have similar motif composition. The results showed that these 17 BCCP proteins all contained three conserved motifs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>a). Compared with BCCP protein in 
 <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, there are also three conservative motifs, but there are still differences in the motif locations among them. Subsequently, we used DNAMAN to compare the amino acid sequence of BCCP in 
 <italic>P. lactiflora</italic> ‘Hangshao’ with the amino acid sequence of other plants in NCBI and found that they have certain similarities (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>b). Then, we constructed the phylogenetic tree with the neighbor-joining method using MEGA 7.0 following multiple alignments of protein sequences with ClustalW (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>c). The alignment results indicated that the BCCP protein sequence has a consistency in different plants. And all 17 BCCPs were divided into 5 clades. Moreover, we analyzed the FPKM value of 17 BCCP (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>d), and found that most of them are less than 10 except BCCP1 (CL14917.Contig1_All), BCCP2 (CL14917.Contig2_All) and BCCP17 (Unigene23603_All) in 30 DAF.
