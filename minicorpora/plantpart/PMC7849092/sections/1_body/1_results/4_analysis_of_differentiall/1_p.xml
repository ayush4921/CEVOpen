<p id="Par59">To understand the patterns of seed development in detail and identify key genes in fatty acid biosynthesis, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed by comparing the FPKM value of unigenes between the different developmental seeds of the herbaceous peony ‘Hangshao’. Based on the gene expression level, DEGs were identified between different groups (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). Seeds at 30 DAF served as the control, and 4635 and 18,291 DEGs were identified at 60 and 90 DAF, respectively. Additionally, seeds at 60 DAF served as the control, and 12,304 DEGs were also identified at 90 DAF. There were 2410, 4210 and 7385 upregulated unigenes and 2225, 8094 and 10,906 downregulated unigenes at 30 vs 60 DAF (Group I), 60 vs 90 DAF (Group II) and 30 vs 90 DAF (Group III), respectively. Two hierarchical cluster analyses were conducted based on the FPKM value of these DEGs for the three groups (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). The DEG intersection (Inter) and DEG union of the three different groups were clustered into three clusters. DEGs in the same cluster had identical or similar expression patterns during the seed developmental stage.
