<p id="Par78">BCCP, or biotin carboxyl carrier protein, is one of the subunits of ACCase, and BC, α-CT and β-CT constitute four subunits of ACCase which catalyze acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA that was the committed step for de novo fatty acid biosynthesis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. As an important component of ACCase, BCCP protein is the link and bridge connecting the other three subunits of ACCase, and plays a very important role in the biosynthesis of fatty acid from seeds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. Studies have shown that the up-regulation of BCCP protein expression is positively correlated with the specific activity of ACCase and the content of seed oil during the development of 
 <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and rapeseed seeds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. We identified 17 unigenes annotated to BCCP from transcriptome database of 
 <italic>P. lactiflora</italic> ‘Hangshao’, and we found that the sequence conservation of BCCP was highly conserved by alignment with the amino acid sequences of family genes of various plants. According to the phylogenetic analysis, 17 BCCPs in 
 <italic>P. lactiflora</italic> ‘Hangshao’ were divided into five clades. Chen et al. found that BCCPs was in four subfamilies, separated by more subtle but statistically significant differences in primary structure [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. Moreover, Thelen et al. believed that 
 <italic>BCCP</italic> gene can encode two kinds of BCCP protein, one can be biotinylated, and the other cannot be biotinylated [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>]. These two kinds of BCCP proteins can regulate the activity of ACCase by competitive binding to the other subunits of ACCase, so as to realize the regulation of fatty acid synthesis process [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>]. From these studies, it has been shown that BCCP has a significant influence on the content of fatty acid of plants.
