<p id="Par53">Previous research has shown that the ratio of omega-6/omega-3 is approximately 1.5:1 in herbaceous peony ‘Hangshao’ mature seed oil. However, the ratio of omega-6/omega-3 increases during seed development because the relative content of ALA decreases gradually and the relative content of LA slightly increases [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Nevertheless, very little research has examined fatty acid accumulation at the molecular level for herbaceous peony seed oil. Fatty acid biosynthesis in plants occurs via a very complicated biological pathway regulated by various enzymes. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) has provided a convenient and rapid method for finding key genes in fatty acid biosynthesis and unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis at the molecular level. De novo transcriptome sequencing had been applied to identify and profile gene expression differences of some herb oilseed plants such as soybean [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and some tree oilseed plants such as tree peony [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], olive [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and 
 <italic>Hiptage benghalensis</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, research on herbaceous peony has mainly concentrated on thermotolerant-related differentially expressed genes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], codon usage patterns [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and anthocyanin biosynthetic genes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] based on transcriptome sequencing. The fatty acid metabolism of herbaceous peony has remained unknown. Moreover, genetic control of the unsaturated fatty acid accumulation of herbaceous peony is unexplored.
