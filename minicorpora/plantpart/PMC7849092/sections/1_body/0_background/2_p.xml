<p id="Par52">Herbaceous peony ‘Hangshao’ seed oil predominantly contains five fatty acids: oleic acid (C18:1
 <sup>Δ9</sup>, OA), linoleic acid (C18:2
 <sup>Δ9,12</sup>, LA), α-linolenic acid (C18:3
 <sup>Δ9,12,15</sup>, ALA), palmitic acid (C16:0, PA) and stearic acid (C18:0, SA) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. OA, LA and ALA are classified as UFAs, which include monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). OA, which can improve diastolic heart function, is a MUFA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. LA and ALA are PUFAs, which can reduce thrombosis, decrease cardiovascular events and prevent cancer [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. According to the location of the last double carbon bond relative to the terminal methyl end of the molecule, PUFAs can be divided into the omega-3 (n-3) series and omega-6 (n-6) series. ALA, an important omega-3 PUFA, is an essential fatty acid that cannot be synthesized in the human body and must be obtained via dietary intake; it is the precursor of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which are essential for the growth and development of the brain and retina [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Additionally, LA, an important omega-6 PUFA, is also an essential fatty acid that cannot be produced by the human body; it is the precursor of the omega-6 series of fatty acids such as γ-linolenic acid (C18:3
 <sup>Δ6,9,12</sup>, GLA) and arachidonic acid (C18:4
 <sup>Δ5,8,11,14</sup>, AA) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Nevertheless, high intake of omega-6 PUFAs with low intake of omega-3 PUFAs might promote the pathogenesis of many diseases, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, and inflammatory and autoimmune diseases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Therefore, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations and the World Health Organization (WHO) suggest that the omega-6/3 ratio should be lower than 5:1 [
