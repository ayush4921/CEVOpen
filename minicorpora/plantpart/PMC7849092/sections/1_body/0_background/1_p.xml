<p id="Par51">As a well-known Chinese traditional flower, herbaceous peony (
 <italic>Paeonia lactiflora</italic> Pall.) was cultivated more than 4000 years. Owing to the beauty of the color, shape and fragrance, it is regarded as ‘the Prime-Minister of flowers’ and is known as the ‘two superb of flowers’ with tree peony (
 <italic>Paeonia suffruticosa</italic> Andr.), which is regarded as ‘the King of flowers’. Herbaceous peony is cultivated as a medicinal and ornamental plant in China. To date, more than 500 cultivars are distributed in different regions of China [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], which have antithrombic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], antitumor [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and anti-posttraumatic stress disorder functions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]; alleviate inflammation [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and so on. As an important medicinal plant, herbaceous peony ‘Hangshao’, the root of which is the traditional Chinese medicine ‘Radix Paeoniae Alba’, is mainly cultivated in Zhejiang Province and widely cultivated in China [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In addition, it has a single lobe and a higher seed-setting rate. However, the tremendous number of seeds from herbaceous peony ‘Hangshao’ are mainly wasted every year, except the handful of seeds that are used for propagation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that the seed oil content of ‘Hangshao’ is approximately 25%, with more than 90% unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Therefore, herbaceous peony ‘Hangshao’ has the potential to be cultivated as a multifunctional plant, not only as an ornamental, medicinal plant but also as an edible oil resource.
