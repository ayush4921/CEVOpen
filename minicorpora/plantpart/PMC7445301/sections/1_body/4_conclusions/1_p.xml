<p id="Par36">The pectin-based nanocapsules loaded with cedar wood essential oil was developed and characterized. The nanocapsules were impregnated on to mini cotton bag producing ready to use (RTU) formulation to treat mosquito-breeding sites. An important feature of the nanocapsules impregnated bag in larvicidal control program is greater effectiveness with long lasting efficacy and comparative simplicity to the existing control methods. The devised technique may contribute in minimizing risk of dustiness and contamination as the bag can be directly placed in mosquito breeding sites. Moreover, the incorporation of botanical pesticide in the nanocapsules may have added advantages of dose reduction, associated risks due to synthetic pesticides and the long-lasting residual effect. The promising results obtained in the larvicidal bioassays provides basis for the future research under realistic field conditions. Therefore, the technique devised in this work could potentially to be used as an effective larvicide in the mosquito management program, which may contribute towards sustainable vector control strategies and combating against mosquito-borne diseases.</p>
