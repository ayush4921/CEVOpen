<p id="Par13">The percent encapsulation efficiency (EE %) i.e. the amount of CWO enclosed into the pectin matrix was determined by the UV–Visible spectrophotometry. The average encapsulation efficiency of 60% was obtained under the optimized conditions and concentration (polymer solution with 1% w/v pectin, cross-linker with 0.5 w/v CaCl2). Since, the encapsulation improves the stability of an essential oil
