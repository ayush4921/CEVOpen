<p id="Par12">Essential oils are highly effective as pesticide, but inherent volatile and degradable nature limits their applicability. Nanoencapsulation, which involves coating of active within a polymer, can be a favorable approach to prevent the volatility of essential oil and increase their efficacy

 </sup>. However, the utilization of natural polysaccharides such as chitosan, sodium alginate, starch, pectin, etc. has become more popular due to their non-toxic, biodegradable and biocompatible properties

 </sup> as a pesticide carrier, therefore, the use of the pectin to load cedarwood essential oil, is acceptable. The CWO nanocapsules were produced via ionic gelation method. Ionic gelation involves the interactions of an ionic polymer with oppositely charged ion to produce hydrogel beads also called as gelispheres, which are spherical cross-linked hydrophilic polymeric entity capable of swelling in water and the release of active is controlled by the polymer relaxation
