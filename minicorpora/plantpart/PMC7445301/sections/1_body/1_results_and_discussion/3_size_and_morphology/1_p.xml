<p id="Par14">Size of the nanocapsules in raw state was observed by Transmission electron microscope (TEM). The TEM image of non-encapsulated emulsion shows the droplets with out any wall coating (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). However, TEM images of the pectin nanocapsules loaded with CWO demonstrate regular distribution and spherical shape with size distributed between the ranges of 40 and 80 nm (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). The in-depth morphology of the outer surface of the nanocapsule was perceived which shows the clear presence of the encapsulating-carrier agents having smooth surfaces without any cracks or pores. Since, the essential oils are inherently volatile in nature and the absence of cracks or pores on the surface may signify that the oil-volatiles is protected against degradation and volatility, this is in agreement with the result published by Ali et al.
