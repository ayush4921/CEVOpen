 </sup>. DSC (differential scanning colorimeter) thermograms of pectin, blank pectin nanoparticles, and CWO loaded pectin nanoparticles are presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. The DSC thermogram of the pectin powder showed a broad endothermic peak at 79 °C which is ascribed to its glass transition temperature and second peak at 158 °C corresponding to its melting point, this is in accordance with previous literature

 </sup>. A broad peak at 122 °C was observed in pectin cross-linked with CaCl
 <sub>2</sub>. The shifting of the peak at high temperature in cross-linked matrices of pectin revealed high thermal stability compared to their individual components, the statement is in agreement to the previous report

 </sup>. After the loading of cedarwood oil in pectin nanocapsule, the peak further shifts to higher temperature at 131 °C. DSC results obtained here indicated that the CWO was stable in pectin nanocapsules, which was produced by crosslinking with CaCl
 <sub>2</sub>. The comparable result was reported previously by Chattopadhyay et al.

 </sup>, who used DSC tool to study the compatibility between the polymer, active and other components of the formulations. In both the cases, the shift towards higher temperature was observed in the thermogram of the polymer loaded with active content. Furthermore the thermal stability of nanocapsules at 131 °C after loading with CWO oil points out that the bags can be cured at 100 °C, the statement is consistent with the previous reports published by Liu et al.
