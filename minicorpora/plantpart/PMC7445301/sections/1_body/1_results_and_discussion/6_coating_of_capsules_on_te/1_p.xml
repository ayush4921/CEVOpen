<p id="Par17">The mechanism of adhesion of the pectin nanocapsules on the cotton bag surface in the presence of acrylate may be attributed to surface modification of cotton fibers, illustrated in a supplementary figure (Supplementary Fig 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). During curing the process at 100 °C, there might be an interaction between –OH group of cellulose (Cell-OH) and –COOH group of acrylate, which may lead to formation of ester linkage. The statement is according to previous reports
