 </sup>. The 4th instar larvae of 
 <italic>An. culicifacies</italic> exposed to nano-CWO showed severe morphological deformities. CWO-nanocapsules directly acted upon, muscle (M), Adipose tissue (AT) and epidermal cells (EC) and displayed completely damaged epithelial cell, muscles and adipose tissue (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b). In contrast, LS examination of the control larval tissues displayed intact and undamaged assembly of epithelial cell, muscles and adipose tissue (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). The results are in accordance with previous reports

 </sup>. The toxicity of the plant essential oil (EO) as an insecticide mainly depends on penetration rate of EO into the insect body, their interaction with specific target enzymes and the detoxification ability of the mosquito at each developmental stage

 </sup>. In the present study, the 4th instar larvae 
 <italic>of An. culicifacies</italic> exposed to nano-CWO showed severe morphological deformities. Some earlier researchers have also reported the morphological aberrations induced by nano based botanical pesticide on mosquito larvae

 </sup>. The comparatively severe damage occurred in the larval midgut cells treated with nano-CWO may attributed to the remarkable feature of nanoparticles; larger surface and smaller size, which can promote easy penetration into the larval body and disturb their normal cycle of life by interrupting the intake of feed, cell division and breathing, the statement is supported by previous literature
