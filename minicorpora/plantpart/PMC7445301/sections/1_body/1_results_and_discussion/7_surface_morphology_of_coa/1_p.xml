<p id="Par18">The surface morphology of the bag impregnated with nanocapsules was investigated by SEM. The comparative SEM images of bags before and after impregnation with nanocapsules are presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. The untreated bag (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a) shows blank fibers, whereas, the impregnated bag shows clear presence of nanocapsules onto cotton fibers (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). In addition, the nanocapsules were fixed in the spacing of fibers this may be because of the esterification reaction occurred between acrylate and cellulose during the curing process. The SEM result indicates that the capsules were successfully impregnated on the fibers of bags. A previous study also suggested that the successful impregnation of nanocapsules onto cotton fabric can be carried out using polymeric binder or resin and further its confirmation by SEM imaging
