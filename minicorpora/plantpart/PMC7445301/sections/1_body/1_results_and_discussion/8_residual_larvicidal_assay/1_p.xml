<p id="Par19">The results of larvicidal bioassay are presented in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. In the larvicidal bioassay; the larvae treated with the encapsulated bag initially exhibited lower larval mortality, which was recorded at 70% (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The reason for initial lower mortality may be due to slow release of oil contents as owned by pectin nanocapsules. Generally, the release of active from swellable polysaccharides like pectin occurs by either single or by a combination of three different mechanisms: an osmotically driven force, a diffusion mechanism, or erosion or degradation of the polymer. Here in this case the release from pectin nanocapsules probably governed by a diffusion mechanism which includes several phases; penetration of water into the capsule, resulting in swelling of the matrix followed by conversion of the polymer into a rubbery swollen matrix, resulting in release of the active from the swollen matrix, the statement is supported by previous literature

 </sup>. The initial low mortality rate may be attributed to the ascribed slow release mechanism involving diffusion. However, after complete swelling is achieved, the pectin nanocapsules shows burst release, which is justified by increased release of CWO components resulting in increased mortality rate and 90% reduction in larval population up to 2 weeks followed by 98% mortality up to the fourth week. The results may be attributed to the successful encapsulation and the impregnation of CWO nanocapsules on the fiber of the bag, which offered slow release. Contrast to this the bag coated with free emulsion (non encapsulated), there was a constant decline in mortality rate after 2 weeks, which may be due to the free oil that got completely released from the bag initially. However, no mortality was observed in control (distilled water + surfactants). The difference in bioassay of the encapsulated bag and non-encapsulated bag may be because of the thermodegradation and volatility of bioactives of CWO, which may be responsible for losses of oil components in non-encapsulated bag. However, the losses due to the similar factors seem to be prevented by encapsulation process in the encapsulated bag. It has been stated previously that essential oils are volatile and sensitive to environmental factors, nanoencapsulation may prevent their degradation and volatility

 </sup>, hence the long-term efficacy was attained up to 4 weeks with 98% mortality rate may be attributed to nanoencapsulation. There have been evidences indicating the nanoencapsulation process-enhancing efficacies of essential oils
