<p id="Par11">A total of 49 compounds from the cedarwood essential oil were identified, which accounted for 100% of its total composition. The GC–MS identified several main chemical compounds in the CWO. The peak area correlated to concentration and was greater for β-himachlene (19.8%-RT-retention time 30.7) followed by α-himachlene (15.38%-RT 28.5), Atlantone (14.0%-RT 41.0), Longifolene (7.4%-RT 29.6), Deodarone (4.63%-RT 38). The other compounds detected as an average percentage included; several other sesquiterpenes and monoterpenes. The gas chromatogram of CWO oil is presented in Supplementary Fig 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref> and composition percentage of major and average constituents along with RT is given in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The 
 <italic>Cedrus deodara</italic> is generally rich in sesquiterpenes-himachalene, which was observed as the most abundant constituent of cedar wood essential oil. The results of our findings are in agreement with the previous reports

 </sup> where, similar trends in oil composition of 
 <italic>Cedrus</italic> were reported. However, variation in abundance of constituents was observed in the essential oil, which may differ according to the part of the plant used for the oil extraction and varies according to the geographical zones, the harvest period and the age of the plant

 </sup>. Plants synthesize several secondary metabolites as bio-actives including terpenes and terpenoids. The essential oils of 
 <italic>Cedrus deodara</italic> from the present investigation is therefore identified as a complex mixture of hydrocarbon terpenes and terpenoids, the majority of the first group consists of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, and the second group may consists of oxygenated derivatives of hydrocarbon terpenes i.e. terpenoids
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>
 </sup>. Terpenoids are responsible for notable bioactivity properties
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>
 </sup> and furthermore, the insecticidal activity of essential oils is reported probably due to terpenes and terpenoids content present in the oil
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>
 </sup>. The major identified constituents sesquiterpenes i.e. β-himachalene and α-himachalene, present in oil were reported to possess insecticidal activity
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>
 </sup>. From the above discussion, it may be deduced that the larvicidal activities of CWO essential oil can be because of the high concentrations of himachalene present in the oil, however, the observed larvicidal activity may also be attributed to the synergy between various components of essential oil
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>
 </sup>. Therefore, the phyoto-constituents analysis briefs about the probable compounds responsible for larvicidal efficacy.
