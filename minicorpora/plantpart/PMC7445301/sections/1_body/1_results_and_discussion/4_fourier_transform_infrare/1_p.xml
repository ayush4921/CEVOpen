<p id="Par15">The FTIR spectra of pectin, blank pectin nanoparticles, CWO loaded pectin nanoparticles, and CWO is presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. The pectin shows one of the characteristic peaks at 1741 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, which refers to the CH stretching of carboxyl groups (COOH) and another peak at 1542cm
 <sup>−1</sup> attributed to amide group II was observed which is also supported by previous findings

 <sup>−1</sup>, 1,453 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and 1,334 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, this might be probably due to intermolecular interaction, which is due to complex formation by electrostatic interaction between pectin and divalent metal cation calcium chloride, the statement is in agreement with previous reports

 </sup>. Peaks at 1,375 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and 1455 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> are attributed to the methyl, methylene and CH stretch from CWO terpenes. The peaks at 1617 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> due to C=C stretching, and 2,915 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> due to CH
 <sub>2</sub> symmetrical and asymmetrical stretching. After loading of CWO in pectin nanoparticles, in addition to the characteristic peaks of pectin nanoparticles, the peaks of CWO also appear thereby indicating no modification occurs after loading of oil. This change led to an assumption that CWO might be present into the pectin nanoparticles and molecular compatibility between the CWO constituents’ and pectin nanoparticles could exist.
