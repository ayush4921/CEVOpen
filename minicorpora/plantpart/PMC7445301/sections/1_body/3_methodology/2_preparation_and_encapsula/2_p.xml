 </sup>. Briefly, a fixed weight of microcapsules (200 mg) was taken and diluted with ethanol. The mixture of ethanol and sonicated for 15 min to allow complete breakage of nanocapsules followed by centrifugation for 5 min. The supernatant was collected and the total amount of encapsulated cedarwood essential oil was determined by UV–Vis spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 326 nm using a Labomed UVD 2960 spectrophotometer. For standard curve several dilutions of oil was prepared and curve was constituted. The trend line was obtained by linear regression with standard equation (

 <sup>2</sup> value (0.99852). The amount of CEO was calculated by appropriate calibration curve of free CEO in ethanol (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.999). The encapsulation efficiency of cedarwood essential oil into pectin‐nanocapsules was calculated by using the following equation.
