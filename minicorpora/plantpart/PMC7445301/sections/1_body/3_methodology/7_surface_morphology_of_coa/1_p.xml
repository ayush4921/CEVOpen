<p id="Par30">To study the morphology of bags, SEM imaging was performed. A part of treated bag was mounted on aluminum stubs using a conductive carbon tape and gold palladium sputtered for a conductive coating. A SEM Tescan Vega 3, Czech Republic, was used at 20Â kV accelerating voltage to image the surface of the bag. Untreated bag was also imaged for reference.</p>
