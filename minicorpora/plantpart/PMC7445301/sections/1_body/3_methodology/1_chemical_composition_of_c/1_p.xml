<p id="Par22">The major components of cedar wood essential oil were identified through GC–MS (Shimadzu QP 2010 74707 Plus) equipped with an FID and capillary column (0.32 mm i.d., length: 30 m, film thickness 0.25 µm). Injection volume was 1 µl, oven temperature was programmed with 50 °C (hold time 5 min), which was increased at the rate of 10 °C/min to 300 °C (hold time 5 min). Injection temperature was 250 °C, with a split ratio of 10. The chemical constituents of oil were identified using GC–MS by comparing the individual mass spectra with the database of National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST12 or NIST62-) libraries.</p>
