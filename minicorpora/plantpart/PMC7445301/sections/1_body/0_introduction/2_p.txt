0: The control of malaria vector,  Anopheles, relies upon indoor residual spray (IRS) and insecticide treated nets (ITN) 5.
1: Several other control tools have also been proposed including; nano pesticides, microbial pesticides (that are natural occurring bacteria, fungi and viruses) and pesticides of plant origin, which may act as repellents, oviposition deterrents and larvicides etc.
2: 6,  7.
3: A new generation biotechnological tool in mosquito control program, based on genetically modified mosquitoes and sterile Insect Technique (SIT) is also being considered 7,  8.
4: Despite significant progress so far, further investigations are needed to determine if genetically modification based strategies can be an effective method of mosquito control.
5: These facts point out that the use of pesticides may be probable approach to be considered for the reasonable mosquito targeting.
