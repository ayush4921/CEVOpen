0: In recent years, there has been an increased interest in nanotechnology as a means of improving the effectiveness of pesticide, while at the same time minimizing their environmental impacts.
1: Several studies have described the use of nanostructure systems that offer better efficacy as a mosquito larvicide.
2: Some of the most promising nanostructured systems that can be used as larvicides are based on polymeric encapsulation, followed by nanoemulsions and nanogels, etc.
3: Nanoemulsions that can be formulated within the droplet size range of 20200 nm 18, and, nanogel that are hydrogel particles in the nanometer range, loaded with  Lippia sidoides oil has been described as an efficient mosquito larvicide 11,  19  21.
4: Among all the nanostructure systems, nanoencapsulation is one of the well-documented strategies, which can contribute towards sustainable vector management program.
5: It has attracted attention due to the potential for assisting in reduced doses of pesticides while at the same time improving stability and offering controlled release along with decreased water contamination, and less risk to the consumers 22.
6: Pectin is an inexpensive, non-toxic polysaccharide extracted from citrus peels or apple pomaces, and has been used as a food additive, a thickening agent and gelling agent 23.
7: Pectin is also used as an encapsulating agent leading to release of encapsulated material at the desired site 24.
