<p id="Par10">The study is intended to hypothesize the comparative evaluation on the long-lasting larvicidal efficacy of CWO nanocapsules impregnated bags with that of non-encapsulated bags. The study, therefore, explores a new approach for a safe way of pesticide application, employing botanical and nanoparticles. Here, we present a report describing, design and synthesis of nanocapsules impregnated bag to target immature stages of mosquitoes (illustration-Supplementary Fig 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). Further, we also described long lasting efficacy of nano-encapsulted bag against mosquito larvae. The cured tea bags, impregnated with pectin-cedarwood nanocapsules, could be a RTU (ready to use) formulation to treat mosquito-breeding sites. Such an approach can be effortless and may provide long lasting effects. The nanocapsules impregnated bags may be preferred on account of their safety with respect to reduced direct exposure to the pesticides along with convenience in handling and prolonged effectiveness. This reduces application of pesticides to the target, which may cut costs of the active ingredient used for spray applications.
