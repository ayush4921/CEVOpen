0: The above evidence provides the rationale behind this study that aimed to devise a technique to get the better of liquid preparation, through the concept of the nanocapsules impregnated mini bag.
1: The impregnation of cotton fabric with the nanocapsules and microcapsules has been reported for long-lasting mosquito repellent and antibacterial effects 26,  27.
2: However, such an approach may certainly be used to larvicidal control program on account of its sustainability.
3: Cotton is made up of cellulose and, therefore, it is easily biodegradable.
4: The cotton based tea bags, therefore, can be used to impregnate pectin-cedar wood nanocapsules.
