0: The study is intended to hypothesize the comparative evaluation on the long-lasting larvicidal efficacy of CWO nanocapsules impregnated bags with that of non-encapsulated bags.
1: The study, therefore, explores a new approach for a safe way of pesticide application, employing botanical and nanoparticles.
2: Here, we present a report describing, design and synthesis of nanocapsules impregnated bag to target immature stages of mosquitoes (illustration-Supplementary Fig  S2).
3: Further, we also described long lasting efficacy of nano-encapsulted bag against mosquito larvae.
4: The cured tea bags, impregnated with pectin-cedarwood nanocapsules, could be a RTU (ready to use) formulation to treat mosquito-breeding sites.
5: Such an approach can be effortless and may provide long lasting effects.
6: The nanocapsules impregnated bags may be preferred on account of their safety with respect to reduced direct exposure to the pesticides along with convenience in handling and prolonged effectiveness.
7: This reduces application of pesticides to the target, which may cut costs of the active ingredient used for spray applications.
