<p id="Par4">The tackling of the mosquito at the immature stage has been considered more convenient, since the insect is most vulnerable. Moreover, the pesticide application is on selected and defined area, therefore, the contamination and wastage due to pesticide applications could be minimized. In the current scenario the synthetic pesticides are extensively used to control larval stages, which is resulting in resistance development, persistence and toxicity to non-target. In this context, plant derived pesticides may preferred on account of their non-persistent and biodegradability
