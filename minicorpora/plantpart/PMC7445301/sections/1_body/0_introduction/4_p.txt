0: The recent advancements have extensively focused on plants based bio-pesticides as an efficient larvicide against  Anopheles culicifacies.
1: In particular few of botanical pesticides, such as Neem ( Azadirachta indica) oil, bio-waste of Cashew nut ( Anacardium occidentale), leaf and seed extracts of castor ( Ricinus communis), Paracress  (Spilanthes acmella), Yellow berry night shade (Solanum xanthocarpum), Clove (Syzygium aromaticum) , Shisham  (Dalbergia sissoo) 10  14 have shown significant larvicidal activity .
2: Although the use of plant-derived botanical pesticides (essential oil and crude plant extract) has occupied key space in pest management yet the application of botanicals is limited due to poor water solubility and further feasibility of the plant-based product is not assured because of volatility, degradation, and stability.
3: Consequently, the potential use of plant material in large-scale applications is not considered as realistic.
4: To overcome these drawbacks bioactive plant products may be formulated; using polymers, plasticizers, stabilizers and biodegradable additives 15.
5: The additives in formulating a plant product may include; polymers, emulsifying agents, surfactants, solvents, stabilizers, de-foamers which ensure the stability, adherence and controlled release of the bioactive compounds, depending on the type of formulation 16.
