0: While earlier studies have shown the potential of nano bio-pesticides in different connections, however, the studies describing the convenient way of application by which, pesticides are delivered to their biological targets have not exemplified.
1: Since, the most of the larvicidal products described are liquid based; nano/micro- emulsions and encapsulated suspensions, etc.
2: (Supplementary Fig  S1).
3: The liquid formulation of pesticide products may affect the extent of exposure, as they are prone to splashing and occasional spillage, resulting in direct skin contact or indirect contact through clothing contamination 25.
4: Moreover, the solid formulation tends to produce dust.
5: In the recent years, there has been considerable interest in developing biodegradable, easy to use and effective pesticide delivery systems.
