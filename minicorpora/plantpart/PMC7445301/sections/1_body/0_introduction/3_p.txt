0: The tackling of the mosquito at the immature stage has been considered more convenient, since the insect is most vulnerable.
1: Moreover, the pesticide application is on selected and defined area, therefore, the contamination and wastage due to pesticide applications could be minimized.
2: In the current scenario the synthetic pesticides are extensively used to control larval stages, which is resulting in resistance development, persistence and toxicity to non-target.
3: In this context, plant derived pesticides may preferred on account of their non-persistent and biodegradability 9.
