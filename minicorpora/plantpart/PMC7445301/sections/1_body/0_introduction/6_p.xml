<p id="Par7">In recent years, there has been an increased interest in nanotechnology as a means of improving the effectiveness of pesticide, while at the same time minimizing their environmental impacts. Several studies have described the use of nanostructure systems that offer better efficacy as a mosquito larvicide. Some of the most promising nanostructured systems that can be used as larvicides are based on polymeric encapsulation, followed by nanoemulsions and nanogels, etc. Nanoemulsions that can be formulated within the droplet size range of 20–200 nm

It has attracted attention due to the potential for assisting in reduced doses of pesticides while at the same time improving stability and offering controlled release along with decreased water contamination, and less risk to the consumers
