<p>Sustainable food production is the key to ensuring food security. Implementation of creative disease management program to reduce the incidence of plant diseases and pathogen resistance is one of the important strategies worth pursuing to achieve this goal. Planning and implementing successful strategies for disease management is necessary to guarantee sustainable crop production systems (

Tropical plants disease outbreak had threatened the ecosystems and agricultural crops which had forced research community to find innovative ways in inhibiting pathogen growth while maintaining crop yield, quality and health status. The use of natural plant products such as ginger essential oils (EOs) is an ideal approach for plant protection in the tropics. In recent times, plant natural products are used not only because of their biological and antimicrobial activities to counter plant diseases (
