<p>Ginger EOs could be sustainable alternative for controlling tropical plant diseases. Being environmental friendly, the interest in the use of EOs in crop protection is increasing. The emergence of resistant bacteria and fungi pathogens to many antimicrobial agents is a major challenge in agriculture. Hence, new antimicrobials are needed. The use of ginger EOs in plant disease control will mitigate major agricultural problems in plant-pathogen interactions. Nevertheless, their use in agriculture has been limited by their relatively low water solubility and stability coupled with their high volatility. Nanotechnology is a groundbreaking technology with possible uses in agriculture. Furthermore, nanoparticles are attractive resources because they can solve the limitations of EOs such as light, humidity, and warm temperature. By exploiting EOs potentials and creating synergies between EOs and their constituents using state of the technologies, the problems of plant disease control in the tropics can be minimized.</p>
