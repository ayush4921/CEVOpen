<p>The plant protection concept emphasizes production of safe crop with the least possible effect on the agro-ecosystem, discourage the use of chemical control measures, and supports the use of natural products, such as ginger EOs/ginger Eos-based nanotechnology. Scientific evidences to support the use of both preventive and direct plant protection measures using natural products that may reduce uneconomic, unjustified chemical pesticide treatments, and reduction of adverse environmental and human health impacts are overdue. Sustainable plant protection entails the potential use of ginger EOs/ginger Eos-based nanotechnology for sustainable and effective plant disease control in the tropics.</p>
