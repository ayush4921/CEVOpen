<p>Ginger EOs have phytoconstituents such as monoterpene and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (

However, because of their low water solubility and high sensitivity to oxygen, moisture, heat, and light, so that the use of EOs is limited. The emergence of advanced technologies is making it possible to fix the aforementioned problems associated with EOs use in tropical disease management. The ginger EOs nano-based delivery systems such as nanoemulsions is one of the models for enclosure of these natural bioactive compounds to enhance antimicrobial activity, thus, it can bring active compounds to the desired site, shield them from adverse environmental factors to increase their effectiveness (

The most likely result of the antimicrobial action is a blend of activities with different targets within a cell. The hydrophobic nature of EOs/EOs nano-based product might be responsible for the destruction of a cell structure resulting in increased permeability because of the cell inability to distinguish the EOs from the cell membrane components (
