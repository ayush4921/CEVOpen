<p>The emergence of EOs as one of the imperative tools for plant disease control in the tropics will also continue to be a driving force economically for changing the present agricultural practices to better. Novel delivery systems for plant protection, improvement and productivity of tropical crops have the potential to be increased with the use of nanotechnology-based EOs and hence will provide more affordable solution (

At present, nanotechnology is one of the most promising disease control technologies for protection and preservation of tropical crops against bacterial and/or fungal pathogens. Some of the top companies in the world are focusing on formulating nanoscale pesticides for delivery via nanoencapsulation into the target host tissue. Many formulations are made to contain nanomaterials (

Thus, they are employed as nanoscale particles to constitute antimicrobial nanoparticle suspensions which can be conveniently combined with different media such as gels, liquids and creams (
