<p>Past researches had revealed that different nanoparticles affect disease causing organisms, rodents, and insects. Therefore, it imperative to use nanoscale to prepare new formulations which are made from natural products such as EOs for pesticides, insecticides, and insect repellants (

 <xref rid="ref116" ref-type="bibr">Valentim et al. (2018)</xref> revealed that EOs-nanoemulsion is effective against 
 <italic>Colossoma macropomum monogeneans</italic>. Likewise, nanoemulsions containing citral-EOs have the capability of disrupting and penetrating the lipid structure of the bacterial cell wall. It results in protein denaturation and cell membrane destruction followed by cytoplasmic leakage and conformational changes and cell death. Nanoemulsion composition significantly affects antimicrobial activities. A guided delivery system of functional molecules produced from EOs would function in the treatment of plant diseases (

 <xref rid="ref74" ref-type="bibr">Mahdavi et al. (2018)</xref> revealed that polymeric nanofibers containing ginger EOs showed that because of the steady and continuous released of the effective components of EOs loaded onto nanofibers become more powerful.
