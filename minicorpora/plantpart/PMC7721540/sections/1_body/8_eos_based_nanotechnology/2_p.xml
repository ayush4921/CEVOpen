<p>Ginger EOs often exhibited excellent antimicrobial activity but their applications are very limited due to their low water solubility and high oxygen, moisture, heat and light susceptibility. Nanotechnological innovation has emerged as solutions to these emerging challenges, improving their stability, water solubility and shielding them from degradation. EOs delivery systems such as nanoemulsions, microemulsions, solid-lipid nanoparticles and liposomes are models for enclosure of such natural bioactive compounds to enhance antimicrobial activity (

Nanoemulsions are dispersions of nanoparticles consisting of two insoluble liquids, namely oil, and water, one of which is distributed by an emulsion-stabilizing surfactant on the other. Surfactants are required to formulate nanoemulsions for droplet size reduction, interfacial layer inflexibility, and droplet quality below 100 nm (

The reduction to nanometric scale of droplet size raises the area of the substrate and it as well promote contact with microbial pathogen resulting in lysis and cell death. The components of EOs can access cell membrane pathways with their sizes, surface-to-volume ratios, physical and chemical stabilities, and degree of selectivity, thus setting the passage of EOs to reach their target locations (
