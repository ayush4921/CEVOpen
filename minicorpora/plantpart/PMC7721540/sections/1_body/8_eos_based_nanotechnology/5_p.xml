<p>Researches have demonstrated that nanotechnology are suitable carriers of active materials because they can be rapidly prepared, they have a simple structure, they have better thermodynamic stability, their cost of production low, and they can be mass produced (
 <xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">Echeverria and de Albuquerque, 2019</xref>). Nanotechnology-based systems have many advantages such as (1) higher ratio of surface to area and higher free energy making them efficient transport system because higher surface improves absorption rate and also reduces volatility, thus increasing bioavailability and active ingredient absorption, (2) no possible intrinsic creaming, flocculation, coalescence, and sedimentation, because they are thermodynamically and kinetically stable, (3) they reduce volatility, thus increasing absorption rate and amount, (4) their formulation can be applied as foams, creams, oils, and sprays, (5) their non-toxic, non-irritating nature of nanoemulsion provides basis for their application to protect and preserve tropical crops, (6) nanoemulsions can bring active ingredients of both hydrophilic and lipophilic parts to the desired site, (7) nanoemulsions protect the active ingredients against hydrolysis and oxidation because of oil-droplet encapsulation, and (8) development and application of nanoemulsions are economically viable compared with other delivery systems.
