<p>Different technologies and techniques have been developed to increase and boost agricultural productivity by developing new formulations of pesticides from natural plant products. Nowadays, society is seen as a technologized modern society, where technology advances will find the great solutions to human problems (

Nanotechnology has been relied upon in recent years to play a significant role in tropical food production, health and quality in the sense that the use of nanotechnology contributed to effective plant disease control. It is one of exciting field of science as well as benefiting technology in plant disease control by formulating natural products such as ginger EOs as natural pesticides to control tropical plant diseases (

Usually nanomaterials are made based on models for the enclosure of natural bioactive compounds which are particles with one or more dimensions with 100 nm or less. This can be achieved by integrating these natural products as nanomaterials. These nanomaterials in the form of polymeric NPs, liposomes, solid lipid NPs, and nanoemulsions comprise an inner liquid core surrounded by an outer polymer layer in which the active compounds are confined to a cavity and finally allow reaching the target area (
