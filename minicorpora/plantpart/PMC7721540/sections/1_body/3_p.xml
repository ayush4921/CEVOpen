<p>Consequently, in order to deal with old and new emerging plant diseases and other threats to crop production, farmers and researchers need to be well versed in the use of natural products such as nanotechnology-based ginger EOs. Efficient and viable plant protection measures using nanotechnology-based ginger EOs are important for societyâ€™s economic, environmental and social well-being. Increased in crop yields can be related to good plant disease management, including a deeper understanding of natural compounds (ginger EOs) and their use as an efficient way to combat tropical plant diseases. This paper discusses the importance of ginger EOs, EOs-nanotechnology and phytochemical components as antimicrobial active agents as well as their potential applications in controlling plant diseases in the tropical regions. The mechanisms of action of ginger EOs are also discussed.</p>
