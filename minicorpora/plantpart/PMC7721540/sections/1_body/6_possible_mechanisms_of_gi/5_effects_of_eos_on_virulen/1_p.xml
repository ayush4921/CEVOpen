<p>EOs affect the virulence factors of microbes by inhibiting bacterial motility through inhibition of flagella formation, destruction of the basic structure of flagella and its synthesis, and degradation of flagella. Flagellin contains a pathogen-related molecular pattern which initiates a cascade for signal transduction. It should be noted that while the degradation of flagella can destroy bacterial motility to decrease the corresponding adhesive and infective abilities, the disappearance of flagella can also cause undesirable changes to the bacteria and lead to death of the bacteria (
