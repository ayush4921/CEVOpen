<p>A significant proportion of signaling systems had been described in plant pathogens, with the major ones being quorum sensing (QS) and signal transduction pathways (

 <xref rid="ref126" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). QS is a bacterial communication mechanism often which it used to convey different surviving or virulence traits which result in increased resistance. Thus, bacteria use QS to interact and evaluate cell density by generating small sensing components, termed as auto-inducers. These auto-inducers are detected in the immediate environment by bacteria and influence gene expression when a critical limit is reached. The mechanisms identified to clarify the anti-QS action of EOs include inhibiting the production of QS signaling molecules and inactivating of cognate receptors, which in effect inactivate the expression of virulence genes required for cohesiveness. Generating and storing signal molecules is the prerequisite for activating the QS system so that it is able to inhibit the output of signals (
