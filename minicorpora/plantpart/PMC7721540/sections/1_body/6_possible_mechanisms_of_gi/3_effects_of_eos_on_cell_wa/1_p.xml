<p>Hydrophobicity is the most important characteristic that makes the operation of EOs in living cell effective. EOs can partition into the lipids layer of cell membranes as hydrophobic compounds (
 <xref rid="ref101" ref-type="bibr">Sahu et al., 2018</xref>). Such action disturbs cell membrane and makes it more permeable, enabling ion and metabolite leakage (
 <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">Chouhan et al., 2017</xref>). Whereas leakage does not result in a loss of cell viability up to a certain point, further leakage may be lethal (for example, bacterial cell membrane) (

 <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">Chouhan et al., 2017</xref>) suggesting that regulation of cellular processes such as transcription of DNA, protein synthesis, or activation of enzymes were altered (

 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). EOs tend to function on cytoplasmic membrane as cell proteins (
 <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">Dhifi et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref72" ref-type="bibr">Lucas et al., 2012</xref>). Such action disturbs cellular processes resulting in alteration of protein synthesis. There are two major pathways of the mechanisms of action. The EOs lipophilic molecules that accumulate in the lipid bilayer of the cell interact with lipid-protein to alter the phospholipid bilayer integrity or by interacting with the embedded phospholipid bilayer active transport proteins (
