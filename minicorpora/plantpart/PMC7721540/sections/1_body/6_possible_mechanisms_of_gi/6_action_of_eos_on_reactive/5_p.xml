<p>Similarly, FR is an important antibacterial mode of action of EOs. This reaction produces hydroxyl radicals (
 <sup>•</sup>OH) which are highly reactive and toxic. Hydroxyl radicals oxidize lipids, causing oxidative damage that induces hydrophobic phospholipids in the membrane, and increases membrane fluidity, resulting in abnormalities, damage to the membrane structure and function. Furthermore, according to some findings, ferrous ion (Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>) is capable of binding to biomolecules, and OH
 <sup>−</sup> formation can occur in the immediate vicinity of DNA, proteins, and lipids, causing its detrimental effect (
 <xref rid="ref80" ref-type="bibr">Memar et al., 2018</xref>). Fe
 <sup>2+</sup> displays a sequence-specific affinity when communicating with DNA and leads to the FR in which 
 <sup>•</sup>OH production causes much of the damage. Hence, more covalently bonded iron is involved in the Fenton oxidation reaction, leading to the formation of 
 <sup>•</sup>OH and bacterial death. However, gene expression related to proton transportation in the cell will decreased by the presence of Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>. ATP synthesis coupled proton transport can all affect the synthesis of ATP necessary for intracellular protons to be transported outside the cell. Decreased expression of these genes increases the ferrous concentration by reducing the transport of extracellular protons and decreasing intracellular pH, resulting in damage to the cell membrane and cell death (

 <xref rid="ref65" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al. (2020)</xref> on EOs against 
 <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> revealed that 
 <italic>trans-</italic>cinnamaldehyde and salicylaldehyde antibacterial mode of action is ROS generation by FR triggered the down-regulation of the ATP synthesis-related gene sequence, degraded iron ion homeostasis and corrupted ROS protection mechanism. EOs induce ROS as a principal mechanism of antibacterial effect. It has a different approach to killing ROS and FR-induced microbial cells which eventually disrupts the membrane and kills the cell. This will make EOs as a promising bioagent that would promote natural antimicrobials for the control of tropical plant diseases.
