<p>However, according to some researches, phenolic compounds (Gingerols, Shogaols, Zingerone, etc.) and their synergistic volatile compounds such as

 <italic>α</italic> -farnesene, 
 <italic>β</italic> -bisabolene, and 
 <italic>β</italic>-sesquiphellandrene contained in ginger essential oil are primarily responsible for the antimicrobial activity; thus, antibacterial activity of ROS generated and mediated by EOs are as a result of these compounds. The investigations revealed that EOs compounds can disrupted the cellular plasma membrane (
