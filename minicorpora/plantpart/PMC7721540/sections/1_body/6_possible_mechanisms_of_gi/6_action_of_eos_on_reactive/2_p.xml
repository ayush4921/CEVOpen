<p>ROS are generated constantly as naturally occurring substances of certain biological processes and under delicate control and at the same time, some related or non-specific processes catalyze the ROS reactions. Two different processes occur, the production and elimination of ROS that are usually controlled by fine cellular mechanisms. Many a times the stable ROS level is present in the cells by the absence of antimicrobial agents (

However, under certain conditions or with the presence of biopecticides (e.g., EOs) will resulted in increased in cell concentration, called oxidative stress, and disturbs the equilibrium between ROS generation and degradation, thus destroying the microbial cells. ROS serve as an alternative mechanism for the test of bactericides (
