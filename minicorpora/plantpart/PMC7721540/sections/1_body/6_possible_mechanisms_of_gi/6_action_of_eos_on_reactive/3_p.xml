<p>Oxidative stress is basically the disparity amongst cellular respiration and metabolism generating ROS, and the ability of cells to neutralize the harmful effects (
 <xref rid="ref57" ref-type="bibr">Jugreet et al., 2020</xref>). ROS consists of radical and non-radical oxygen species such as superoxide anion (O
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>-</sup>), hydrogen peroxide (H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>), hydroxyl ion (OH
 <sup>−</sup>), hydroxyl radical (
 <sup>•</sup>OH), peroxide (O
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>2-</sup>), and singlet oxygen (
 <sub>1</sub>O
 <sup>2</sup>); these usually affect cell components such as lipids, proteins and nucleic acid (

 <xref rid="ref83" ref-type="bibr">Nazzaro et al., 2017</xref>). Obviously, the encounter between a thriving microbial community and antimicrobials molecules (EOs) that threaten the life of this community and poses huge stress to any microbe in the environment. The critical effect of this stress caused by biopecticides is to create an intracellular environment that is highly conducive to genetic evolution due to a tremendous degree of selective pressure and the microbe’s physiological responses. Such reaction will cause membrane damage at the cellular level, and eventually kill the cell. Covalent modification also results in contact between ROS and proteins/lipids, which typically destabilizes and inactivates a specific protein/lipids (
 <xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">Ezraty et al., 2017</xref>). Nucleic acid is also a prime target for ROS; oxidizing nucleotides like guanine, causing lesion, and breaking the DNA. This results in the production of non-functional proteins which ultimately kill the cells (
 <xref rid="ref80" ref-type="bibr">Memar et al., 2018</xref>). The high ROS concentrations generated, the more effect on cellular membranes which eventually resulted in death of cells.
