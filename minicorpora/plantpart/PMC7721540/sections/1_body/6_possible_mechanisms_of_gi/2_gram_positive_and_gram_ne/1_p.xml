 <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">Dhifi et al., 2016</xref>) because is the fact that Gram-negative bacteria are the holders of the outer membrane covering the cell wall of plant pathogenic bacteria. Therefore, offer greater resistance to EOs by preventing easy diffusion through the lipopolysaccharide membrane and preventing their accumulation in the cell (
 <xref rid="ref112" ref-type="bibr">Tao et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, the cell of the Gram-negative bacteria is rigid, rich in lipopolysaccharide, and more complex, thus restricting the diffusion of hydrophobic compounds through cell membrane, whereas this extra-complex membrane is absent in Gram-positive bacteria which are only surrounded by a thick peptidoglycan wall, lipophilic ends of lipoteichoic acid in the cell membrane, which is really not sufficiently dense to stop smaller antimicrobial molecules, thus, enabling entry to the cell membrane (
