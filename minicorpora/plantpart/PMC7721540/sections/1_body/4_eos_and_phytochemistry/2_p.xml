<p>The active chemical components in ginger EOs are divided into two major groups, namely, monoterpenes and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons with the general formula of (C
 <sub>5</sub>H
 <sub>8</sub>)
 <sub>n</sub> and oxygenated hydrocarbon compounds, including aldehydes, phenols, esters, oxide ethers, alcohols, and ketones. Approximately 1,000 monoterpene and 3,000 sesquiterpene hydrocarbons exist. There are other pungent constituents in ginger EOs but in small quantities. Gingerol, shogaol, and paradol, are specific compounds containing sulphur or nitrogen. The chemical components of EOs are similar to those for oils, but differ in their texture, not greasy, and light in weight (

 <italic>α</italic>-zingiberene, geranial, 
 <italic>α</italic>-curcumene, 
 <italic>β</italic>-bisabolene, 
 <italic>β</italic>-sesquiphellandrene, and neral. These compounds have been related to which most biological activities and distinctive flavor/aroma of EOs. 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the presence of monoterpene components such as 
 <italic>trans-</italic>caryophyllene, camphene, geranial, eucalyptol, and neral as well as sesquiterpene hydrocarbons mainly 
 <italic>α</italic>-zingiberene, ar-curcumene, 
 <italic>β</italic>-bisabolene, 
 <italic>β</italic>-sesquiphellandrene. The most reported available components with high concentrations (%) are 
 <italic>α</italic>-zingiberene (18.0-28.0%), geranial (7.8-13.8%), neral (5.3-10.5%), 
 <italic>trans-</italic>caryophyllene (9.0-10.8%), eucalyptol (5.0-5.5%), 
 <italic>β</italic>-phellandrene (4.9-5.5%), camphene (5-11.5.0%), 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene (2.1-3.0%), and heptan-2-ol (1.0-2.0%). These compounds might be responsible for their distinctive flavor and aroma as well as antibacterial and antifungal activities. 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> shows the chemical compounds in wild ginger EOs. Monoterpenes such as camphene, geranial, geranyl acetate, anethole, fenchyl acetate, and neral as well as sesquiterpene hydrocarbons mainly 
 <italic>α</italic>-humulene, 
 <italic>α</italic>-curcumene, 
 <italic>β</italic>-bisabolene, and 
 <italic>β</italic>-sesquiphellandrene were identified. The most abundant compounds are E-methyl isoeugenol (37.7-42.2%), caryophyllene (4.3-6.7%), 
 <italic>β</italic>-bisabolene (1.5-5.2%), anethole (1.4-4.60%), eucalyptol (1.4-3.6%), 
 <italic>β</italic>-bisabolol (1.9-4.0%), globulol (1.9-3.8%), arcurcumene (4.4-11.5%),
