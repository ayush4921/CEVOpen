<p>Tropical crops face major yield losses due to insect pests and plant diseases. One of the main drawbacks of disease control approaches is the environmental factor. In the tropics, the environment is highly conducive for proliferation of many plant pathogens all year round. Moreover, the efficacy of the existing synthetic chemicals is limited in the field due to their adverse environmental effects (
