<p>The farmer-researcher relationship in understanding of plant disease control measures is important for effective plant disease management. Farmers’ knowledge on field diseases control by natural product or ginger EOs is exceptionally low. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a cooperation/collaboration between farmers and scientists on the use of ginger EOs for effective control plant diseases. Governments must provide incentives and emphasize on the need for extension workers and researchers to recognize and develop farmers’ awareness on plant disease control using EOs. Such perspectives into the awareness of farmers about plant disease control with natural products such as ginger EOs can provide the basis for more collaborative management of plant disease control in the tropics.</p>
