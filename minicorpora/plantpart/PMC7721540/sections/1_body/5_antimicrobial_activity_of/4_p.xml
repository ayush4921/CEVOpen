<p>In field experiments, the antimicrobial properties of ginger EOs with non-toxic features can be used to evaluate disease control efficacy on tropical plant diseases such as fusarium wilt of banana (

 <italic>. cubense</italic>), papaya dieback (
 <italic>Erwinia mallotivora</italic>), and basal stem rot of oil palm (
 <italic>Ganoderma boninense</italic>). The effects of EOs on tropical field crops are distinct from those of the conventional pesticides. Nonetheless, in comparison to the EOs, the test outputs of chemical pesticides may demonstrate in higher degree of effectiveness. However, other report revealed that EOs play a key role on various crops production as assessed by the integrated pest management program (IPM), in which specific approaches work in a synergistic manner for high yield and quality product (

Therefore, intensive open field experiments are needed to uncover the mechanisms underlying the antimicrobial activity of ginger EOs with their interactions as well as improving their action against the target host through nanoemulsion approach could protect crops against pathogenic microbes.
