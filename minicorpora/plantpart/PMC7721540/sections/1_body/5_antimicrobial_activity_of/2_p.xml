<p>The antimicrobial properties ginger EOs had been extensively studied using advanced scientific methods. The evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of EOs is done by testing their effectiveness on living organisms such as bacteria and fungi, which can range from molecular tissue to the whole organism. It is a stage of evaluating the conduct of the EOs on the test species (
