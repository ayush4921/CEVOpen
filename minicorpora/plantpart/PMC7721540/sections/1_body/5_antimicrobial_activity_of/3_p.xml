<p>Furthermore, earlier 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies had indicated that ginger EOs could be used as effective antimicrobial agents for animal diseases. However, data on the antimicrobial activity of ginger EOs against plant bacterial and fungal pathogens are very minimal. Nevertheless, because of the biologically active compounds present in ginger EOs are known to be antibacterial and antifungal bioagents, thus the research interest on testing for controlling plant diseases are increasing. Many studies revealed that the characteristics of the oils contributing to the respective antimicrobial activity depend on the nature of the plant volatile oils, the structural arrangement of the components, and their functional groups or potential synergistic interactions between the components. The correlation between the antimicrobial activity of the compounds and their relative percentage composition in the plant volatile oils with their chemical structure, functional groups, and configuration, indicates their bioactivity (
