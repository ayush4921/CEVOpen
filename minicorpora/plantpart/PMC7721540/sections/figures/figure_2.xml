  <p>Roles of ginger essential oils on phytopathogen cells for plant disease control. The essential oils (EOs)â€™ biological properties are closely related to their aromatic compounds. In relation to mechanisms of action, the chemical composition of the EOs and their 
   <italic>in vitro</italic> phytotoxic activity against phytopathogenic cells play an important role in crop protection in the tropics.
