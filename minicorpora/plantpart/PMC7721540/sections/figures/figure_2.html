 <caption> Roles of ginger essential oils on phytopathogen cells for plant disease control. The essential oils (EOs)â€™ biological properties are closely related to their aromatic compounds. In relation to mechanisms of action, the chemical composition of the EOs and their in vitro phytotoxic activity against phytopathogenic cells play an important role in crop protection in the tropics. </caption>
