 <caption> Transmission electron micrograph showing the effect of ginger essential oils (EOs) on bacterial cells which causes ultrastructural modifications. (A) Cells with a normal rod shape, smooth and bright surface. (B) Cells treated with ginger EOs showing irregular shape with sunken surfaces, severely disruption of the cells, thus, lead to membrane disruption, protein, and mitochondria dysfunctions, DNA damage which lead to inhibition of electron transport chain and metabolic process regulation, and finally cell death. </caption>
