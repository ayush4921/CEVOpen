  <p>Application of encapsulated ginger essential oils (EOs) with its physical and chemical stability to the target locations. Nanoemulsion-related benefits include bioavailability, controlled release, and protection of EOs from environmental stresses. Their applications are promising agents that can be used in plant protection to improve the anti-microbial, antifungal, antiviral and pesticide activities of EOs. This may solve many agricultural problems in plant-pathogen interactions.</p>
