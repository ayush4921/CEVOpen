0: One of the principal public health problems is drug resistance among bacteria and fungi.
1: The treatment of fungal infections, especially caused by  Trichophyton,  Candida, and  Aspergillus species, is most challenging due to its toxicity and side effects of used drugs [ 39, 40].
2: The most common human pathogens bacteria  Staphylococcus aureus and  Escherichia coli cause many infections in all age groups [ 41, 42, 43].
3: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in research and development of new antimicrobial drugs from different sources to prevent microbial resistance.
4: One of the options to help overcome different bacterial or fungal infections could be natural treatment [ 44, 45].
5: Essential oils chemical composition is a good source of biologically active compounds, especially, in natural plants containing essential oils.
6: No study has been reported about antimicrobial potential of -TA rich  T. pulegioides essential oil against different human pathogenic microorganism groups.
