<p id="p0070">Reducing the amount of CB would be the easiest solution for the reduction in saturated fatty acids in chocolate. However, this solution would also increase the viscosity of liquid chocolate and the hardness of solid chocolate, affecting both manufacturability and product quality (
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Aidoo etÂ al., 2014</xref>). Hence, CB is often only partially replaced by different compounds, attempting to reduce the fat content while maintaining the properties needed for an acceptable product. Such changes can affect the crystalline structure of CB as illustrated in the next paragraphs.
