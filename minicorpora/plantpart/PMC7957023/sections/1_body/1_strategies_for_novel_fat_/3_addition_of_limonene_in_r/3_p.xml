<p id="p0080">The amount of limonene in an alternative chocolate product would have to be controlled to keep the conversion of CB crystals from form V to form VI to a minimum, while providing a substantial CB reduction and the desired viscosity. Limonene has also been shown to accelerate the polymorphic conversion of form V to form VI also in some cocoa butter equivalents (
 <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">Miyasaki etÂ al., 2016</xref>). The aforementioned studies do not include any sensory analysis; hence, a better mouthfeel related to decreased solid chocolate hardness has not been confirmed yet. Also, the limonene may impart a lemon flavour to the chocolate and sensory analysis would confirm if it is at an acceptable level for consumers. Currently, limonene holds potential to be used in a novel alternative chocolate product but more investigation looking into the effect of this compound in CB and mixtures of CB and other CB replacing fats on sensory perception is required.
