<p id="p0075">Limonene is a cyclic monoterpene that has been considered for use in reduced CB chocolate products since 1999 (
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Beckett, 1999</xref>). The addition of limonene changes the kinetics of CB crystallization as it dilutes the CB, causing fewer CB crystals to form and disrupting the crystal packing. (
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Do et al., 2008</xref>). Such disruption lowers the chemical potential of the CB crystal network, depressing the melting point of the fat mixture (
 <xref rid="bib82" ref-type="bibr">Ray et al., 2012</xref>). The lower melting point induced by limonene counteracts the increase in viscosity and hardness caused by the reduction of CB. However, the higher the amount of limonene that is added to chocolate, the more likely and quickly it is to bloom (
 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Juhaida et al., 2019</xref>). Fat bloom is due to CB melting and recrystallizing as a more stable polymorph (form VI) at the surface of chocolate products (
 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Juhaida et al., 2019</xref>). The appearance of fat bloom reduces the quality of the chocolate so it should be avoided, not accelerated. The dilution of CB with limonene to decrease chocolate viscosity was also found to lead to a quicker polymorph conversion of form V to form VI (

 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Juhaida et al., 2019</xref>). Polarised light microscopy of CB and limonene mixtures showed an increased crystallization rate in the early stages of isothermal crystallization compared to pure CB (
 <xref rid="bib82" ref-type="bibr">Ray et al., 2012</xref>). A mixture of limonene and CB were also found to crystallise faster at 17 ​°C than 20 ​°C due to the higher concentration of α crystals at 17 ​°C for a quick α-mediated polymorphic transformation to β’ (
