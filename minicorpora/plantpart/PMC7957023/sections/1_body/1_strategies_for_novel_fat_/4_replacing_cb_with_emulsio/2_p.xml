<p id="p0085">The use of emulsions and gels have been considered to create different reduced fat foods and the same strategy could be used to reduce the caloric content of chocolate (

 <xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">Nguyen et al., 2017</xref>). A low-cost solution to reduce CB content is to replace it with water. A water-in-CB emulsion (see 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) with 40% water (all water droplets below 5 ​μm diameter size) has been suggested to be comparable with normal milk chocolate (
 <xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr">Prosapio and Norton, 2019</xref>). The use of margarine processing equipment to incorporate water in molten CB could be easily incorporated into chocolate processing plants, and it has been shown to create form V CB crystals (
 <xref rid="bib95" ref-type="bibr">Sullo et al., 2014</xref>). Previous work on water-in-CB emulsions showed that shells of sintered CB crystal formed at the oil/water interface, stabilizing the emulsion (
 <xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">Norton and Fryer, 2012</xref>). Different emulsifiers were also added to further stabilize water-in-CB emulsions. Carrageenan was tested but increasing its concentration past 1.5% w/w led to an increase in unstable CB polymorphs formation, particularly form II (
 <xref rid="bib95" ref-type="bibr">Sullo et al., 2014</xref>). The emulsifier soybean lecithin caused flocculation of the water droplets, leading to an increase in chocolate viscosity. This is not desired as decreasing the amount of fat itself, increases chocolate viscosity (
 <xref rid="bib95" ref-type="bibr">Sullo et al., 2014</xref>). The emulsifier polyglycerol polyricinoleate (PGPR) was found to provide the best rheological properties in liquid chocolate (
 <xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr">Prosapio and Norton, 2019</xref>). This shows how the use of additives is important when using water as a fat replacer and how it is essential to find one which does not cause unstable CB crystallization.
