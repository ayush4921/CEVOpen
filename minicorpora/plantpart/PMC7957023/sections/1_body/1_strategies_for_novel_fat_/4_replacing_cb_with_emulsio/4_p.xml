<p id="p0095">Oleogels have also been considered as a fat replacer for CB. Oleogels can entrap liquids and oils by forming a gel using structurants, such as ethyl cellulose, waxes and monoglycerides (
 <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Martins et al., 2018</xref>). The use of oleogels in chocolate products has been examined due to the potential to form a heat resistant material and partially replace saturated triacylglycerides with unsaturated ones (

 <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Marangoni, 2018</xref>). It has been shown that 100% v/v CB substitution with a monoglyceric stearate oleogel can produce a solid dark chocolate with a lower amount of solid fat and saturated fatty acid content (

 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Kamali et al., 2019</xref>). The oleogel structure also increased the oxidative value of the amaranth oil maintaining its level of essential linoleic fatty acid (

 <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">Martirosyan et al., 2007</xref>). However, its positive effects may be undone by the high fat and sugar levels in chocolate. These types of gels can still contain a high proportion of fat, so they are more suitable if the goal of the product is only to have a lower saturated fat content than traditional chocolate.
