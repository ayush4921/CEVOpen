<p id="p0115">Protein based gels have been used in different food products to reduce their fat contents, including addition of gelatine in low fat yoghurt (
 <xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">Nguyen et al., 2017</xref>). Using this strategy to partially substitute CB and increase the protein content of an alternative chocolate product would appeal to active consumers looking for a product with a low fat and high protein health claim. The partial substitution of CB with collagen hydrolysate led to acceptable results with the best formulation reducing the fat and energy content by 11% and 35.8% respectively (
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Ashrafie et al., 2014</xref>). In this study a sensory analysis was conducted. No significant difference in acceptability was found between the control and the reduced CB chocolates, even though the rheological properties were different, and the reduced CB chocolate did not fit the standard rheological model used to test chocolate (
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Ashrafie et al., 2014</xref>). This shows how the rheological properties do not have to be identical to those of normal chocolate in order to have a product that is still acceptable to the consumer. However, 
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Ashrafie et al. (2014)</xref> did not investigate the effect of collagen hydrolysate on the crystallization of CB, which could have shown why the chocolate does not have the same rheological model as normal chocolate. It is also important to consider that collagen is of animal origin and is not consumed by those following vegetarian or vegan diets.
