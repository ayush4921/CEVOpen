<p id="p0120">As well as protein, polysaccharides could be used to substitute CB. β-glucan and inulin, together or separately, have been shown to be able to replace up to 50% of CB with acceptable sensory characteristics (as shown in 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) and may be able to give the final product a health claim (

 <xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">Rezende et al. (2015)</xref> tested these polysaccharides on sucrose free chocolate; a formulation strategy that could provide several health claims: low in sugar, low in fat, high in fibre and beta-glucan to control blood cholesterol levels (
