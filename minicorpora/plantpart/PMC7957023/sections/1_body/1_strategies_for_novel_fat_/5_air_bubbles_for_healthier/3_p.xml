<p id="p0105">Edible oil foams, also called oleofoams, have been also considered recently for the design of novel chocolate fillings with reduced calorific density and specific textures (
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Heymans et al., 2017</xref>) resulting in several patents related also to their use as fat replacers for cakes, pastry and biscuits (
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Chisholm et al., 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Gunes et al., 2018</xref>). Oleofoams are typically obtained by whipping a dispersion of fat crystals in a liquid oil phase. The aeration entrains the air bubbles, which are coated and stabilized by crystals through a Pickering mechanism. The fat crystals also form a network in the continuous phase, providing additional stabilization from oil drainage and bubble coalescence (

 <xref rid="bib89" ref-type="bibr">Saha et al., 2020</xref>). Oleofoams display high stability to drainage and coalescence, with amount of air incorporated as high as 66% v/v. The total amount and properties of the fat crystals (size, shape, and polymorphism) affect foamability, foam stability and rheological properties (
