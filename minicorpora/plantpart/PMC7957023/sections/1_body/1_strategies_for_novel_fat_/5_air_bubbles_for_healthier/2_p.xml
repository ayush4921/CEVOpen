<p id="p0100">Air incorporation is another strategy that has been used to reduce the calorific content of chocolate products. The addition of air bubbles does not add any nutritional value to food products, but it lowers their calorific density and significantly affects rheology and texture (
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Campbell and Mougeot, 1999</xref>). In confectionary applications, air bubbles can be incorporated in chocolate products by applying vacuum during tempering, followed by cooling, which entraps the bubbles in a solid matrix. 
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Haedelt et al. (2005)</xref> reported that decreasing the vacuum pressure caused an increase in gas hold-up, as well as an increase in the mean bubble-section diameter. The setting properties of the chocolate, as modified by the addition of edible emulsifiers and non CB fats to the recipe, were found to affect the gas hold-up and bubble size. Softer chocolate allowed expansion of the air bubbles and coalescence, whereas harder formulations resulted in smaller bubble size and higher gas uptake (
