<p id="p0110">For example, micron sized, needle or platelet-like FHR-B (fully hydrogenated rapeseed rich in behenic acid) crystals enabled rapid incorporation of high amounts of air, compared to larger, aggregated crystals which required longer aeration times to reach the same air volume (
 <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Mishima et al., 2016</xref>). In some systems, such as co-crystallized monoglyceride-native phytosterol dispersed in sunflower oil, large, aggregated crystals could not be aerated at all (
 <xref rid="bib99" ref-type="bibr">Truong et al., 2019</xref>). Dispersions of monoglyceride crystals of α or β polymorph in a sunflower oil phase were able to incorporate comparable amounts of air; whereas low-stability polymorphs such as sub-α did not produce any foam (
 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Heymans et al., 2018</xref>). However, it is unclear whether the latter might have melted during the whipping process, resulting in no crystals available for stabilizing the air bubbles. Lack of control over fat polymorphism was reported to hinder air incorporation (
 <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Mishima et al., 2016</xref>) where FHR-B β’ crystals were unable to incorporate any air, compared to β crystals. Finally, Binks &amp; Marinopoulos (
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Binks and Marinopoulos, 2017</xref>) demonstrated that aeration of pure CB was possible if partly molten (SFC between 20 and 30%) as shown in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>. Further work by 
 <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">Metilli et al. (2020)</xref> determined that, in a model CB – Sunflower oil system, the air bubbles were stabilized by β (V) cocoa butter nanoplatelets; the oleofoams were stable to oil drainage up to three months of storage. However, at present there is scarce literature available regarding the acceptance of these novel materials in chocolate products by customers.
