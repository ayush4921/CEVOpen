0: Chocolate is a popular confectionary product throughout the world and its supply is increasing, with sales in the UK in 2020 estimated to be worth 6.7 billion, a 200 million increase from 2019 ( Euromonitor, 2019).

3: CB is the main contributor to the high fat content of chocolate; between 30% and 40% of the weight of chocolate is fat ( Do et al., 2007) and consuming high amounts of this nutritional group is known to contribute to the overconsumption of calories ( National Health Service, 2019).
4: Additionally, CB is particularly high in saturated fat.
5: Table 1 shows the typical values of saturated fat content of dark chocolate products marketed in several countries.
6: The British National Health System, NHS ( National Health Service, 2019), recommends cutting back on foods that are high in saturated fat, due to its association with increased blood cholesterol, leading to a higher risk of coronary heart disease.
