<p id="p0055">Changing the traditional chocolate formulation to create a new product can lead to manufacturing challenges, including those related to changes in the kinetics and thermodynamic of CB and fats crystallization from the chocolate melt. Controlling this unit operation is critical as the crystal structure of CB dictates the sensory properties and shelf life of chocolate (
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Dimick et al., 1999</xref>). CB can crystallize in six polymorphs with form V (β 
 <sub>2</sub>) being the ideal structure, as it contributes to the glossy appearance of chocolate, its melting in the mouth and the snap when broken (
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Beckett, 2008</xref>). Because of the complex physical and chemical interactions between CB and other chocolate ingredients, even small changes in product formulation can lead to significant modification to the crystallization behaviour of cocoa butter and hence the final properties of chocolate. For this reason, this review will focus on the effects that recent chocolate reformulation strategies were found to have on the crystallization of the fat phase in chocolate.
