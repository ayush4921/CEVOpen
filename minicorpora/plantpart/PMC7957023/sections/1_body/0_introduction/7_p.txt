0: Different strategies have been considered to tackle the problems created by the traditional chocolate formulation.
1: Reducing the content of CB in chocolate can reduce the total amount of saturated fatty acids and provide a health and economic benefit.
2: Nevertheless, simply reducing CB content increases the hardness of the chocolate ( Ashrafie et al., 2014) and this should be counteracted by the addition of other ingredients to dilute CB and maintain suitable mechanical properties ( Do et al., 2008).
3: CB can also be partially replaced with mixtures of similar triglycerides (cocoa butter alternatives) or even different edible soft matter systems including emulsions, hydrogels, oleogels and oleofoams, as well polysaccharides and proteins.
