<p id="p0185">Different compounds have been looked at to replicate sucrose in novel chocolate products. One compound that showed potential is inulin, a polysaccharide. 
 <xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">Rezende et al. (2015)</xref> showed that a 25% w/w inulin substitution of CB in sugar free chocolate gave a similar acceptance to normal sucrose based chocolate (
 <xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">Rezende et al., 2015</xref>). The amount of inulin used in chocolate must be controlled as increasing it increases liquid chocolate viscosity (
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Aidoo et al., 2017</xref>). However, when mixing inulin with a polydextrose this increase was not observed, and the yield stress of the reformulated product was not significantly different than normal chocolate. (
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Aidoo et al., 2017</xref>). Polydextrose and inulin were used as bulking agents, to replicate the rheological properties that sucrose imparts to chocolate. Whereas, intense sweeteners such as stevia provide the sweetness. At high fat content and without the use of polydextrose, 38% w/w inulin can fit the standard rheological Casson model as this ratio provides the necessary solid volume fraction (
 <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Kiumarsi et al., 2017</xref>). How inulin is used in relation to other ingredients is important for the functionality of the final product. Inulin and polydextrose mixtures generate a more packed CB crystal network leading to slower melting, which could give the chocolate a different mouthfeel (
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Aidoo et al., 2015</xref>). This high packing is due to inulin disrupting the crystallization of CB causing the formation of large CB crystals, and polydextrose fills in the gaps in the network (
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Aidoo et al., 2014</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Inulin on its own has also been shown to induce the nucleation of form V CB crystals when it has the correct degree of polymerisation (
 <xref rid="bib92" ref-type="bibr">Shah et al., 2010</xref>). Using inulin and polydextrose may also allow for the use of a health claim of “high in fibre” and/or “low in sugar”. However, if there is still a high fat content, the product may not be called healthy overall.
