<p id="p0180">It can be hard to reduce sucrose in many food products due to its important structural role, in addition to its sweetening power. For example, in biscuits sugar gives hardness and inhibits gluten development (

One study looking at the effect of particles on chocolate properties showed that increasing their concentration, and decreasing their size, increased the rate of crystallization kinetics on CB due to their role as heterogeneous nucleating agents (
