<p id="p0200">This review sheds some light on the effect of different potential reformulation strategies on the crystallization behaviour of chocolate. The use of soft matter such as gels, foams or emulsions shows a good potential and allows correct CB crystal growth. There are different CBAs that can be used to decrease the manufacturing cost of chocolate and keep a close resemblance to CB in terms of physiochemical properties, particularly using enzymatic interesterification. Also, there is potential for novel alternative chocolate products to provide additional health benefits if the ingredients are carefully chosen. Sucrose replacers are available, which can even add further health or functional benefits to the novel formulations. The use of plant milk in chocolate is also promising, but more research is needed to find the potential of different plant milks and their combinations.</p>
