<p id="p0135">Fats of different origin can be mixed to obtain CBEs with a similar fatty acid composition to CB. Many CBEs are also obtained by chemically manipulating natural fats using enzymatic interesterification. This technique was developed in the 1980s and is used to modify the composition of CBEs to form more of the triacylglycerides (TAGs) that are normally found in chocolate. For example, a 1,3 regiospecific enzyme can be used with palm mid-fraction triglycerides and stearic acid to create triglycerides with a higher proportion of steric acid in the 1,3 positions, as is common in CB (
