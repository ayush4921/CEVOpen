<p id="p0145">Illipe butter has also been used with palm mid fraction (to provide POP) to obtain a CBE through enzymatic interesterification (
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Bahari and Akoh, 2018a</xref>). When interesterified correctly, this CBE can have a very similar triacylglycerides composition and give similar crystal morphology to CB. Additionally, this CBE has the capability to crystallise in the β polymorph; therefore, products containing this ingredient are expected to have close properties to normal chocolate (
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Bahari and Akoh, 2018b</xref>). This was shown in white and dark chocolates samples (
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Bahari and Akoh, 2018b</xref>). This CBE also generated products with similar rheological properties to CB chocolate. The same study also suggested that fat blooming in dark chocolate could be delayed with the addition of a 0.5% w/w sugar ester to the CBE. However, illipe butter comes from the nut of the 
 <italic>Shorea Stenoptera</italic> tree, which is native to certain areas of Indonesia and Malaysia. This plant has a decreasing population with a classification of near threatened from the ICUN Red List (
 <xref rid="bib81" ref-type="bibr">Randi et al., 1256</xref>). If the use of illipe butter increases, the population of the 
 <italic>Shorea Stenoptera</italic> tree might decrease even further, making illipe butter an unsuitable choice for chocolate.
