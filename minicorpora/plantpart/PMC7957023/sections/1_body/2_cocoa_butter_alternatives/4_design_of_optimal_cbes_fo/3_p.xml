<p id="p0140">It is beneficial to use CBEs with a similar fatty acid composition to CB, as they give comparable chocolate properties such as similar melting points. Ghazani &amp; Marangoni (
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Ghazani and Marangoni, 2019a</xref>) studied the phase behaviour of mixture of POS, SOS and POP and showed how slight differences in their ratio can change the melting point and crystalline structure of the mixture. Large differences between the triacylglycerides composition of CBE and CB would cause large changes in the crystallization process. Therefore, the higher the similarity between the CBE and CB itself, the higher the proportion of CBE that can be used in a chocolate related product without significant changes in the crystallization behaviour of chocolate (

 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Ghazani and Marangoni, 2018</xref>) studied the crystallization behaviour of mixtures of enzymatic interesterified shea stearin and palm mid-fraction and investigated their use as CBEs. A 60:40 w/w mixture produced a CBE with a similar TAG composition and crystal structure to CB, as shown in 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> A and B (
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Ghazani and Marangoni, 2018</xref>). However, when mixing CB with this CBE in a ratio 85:15 w/w, the final crystal size was smaller compared to pure CB as β′ polymorph crystals formed instead of the mixture of β and β’ crystals that was obtained in pure CB (
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Ghazani and Marangoni, 2018</xref>). It was suggested that this was due to the mixture having less trisaturated TAGs than pure CB (
