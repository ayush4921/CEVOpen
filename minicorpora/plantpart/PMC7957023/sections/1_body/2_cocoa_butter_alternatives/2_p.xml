<p id="p0125">The use of cocoa butter alternatives (CBAs) as CB replacers aims to create alternative chocolate products with improved manufacturing costs and sustainability, depending on the origin of the replacing fat. It can also result in improved properties such as thermal resistance. For example, the use of a mango kernel fat CBA to replace CB created a chocolate with increased heat resistance for use in tropical countries (

 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Almost 90% of CB available on the market is made up of three triglycerides: 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-3-stearoyl glycerol (POS), 1,3-distearoyl-2-oleoyl glycerol (SOS) and 1,3-dipalmitoyl-2-oleoyl glycerol (POP) (

If a CBA has a very different triglyceride composition than CB, then the crystallization behaviour and the rheological properties of the liquid chocolate might be unacceptable from a product quality point of view.
