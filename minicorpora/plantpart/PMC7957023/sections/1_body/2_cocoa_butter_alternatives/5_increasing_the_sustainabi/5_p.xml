<p id="p0170">Coconut products are another class of ingredients that have been considered as CB replacers in chocolate products. Coconut is cheaper and slightly more sustainable than CB in some countries, such as India. Furthermore, there are different parts of the coconut that can be used in chocolate manufacturing: coconut oil, milk, and cream (

Substitutions of CB with either 30% coconut milk, 20% coconut cream or 10% coconut oil in chocolate were the preferred variants in sensory analysis participants. However, the rheological properties and crystallization behaviour were not tested (

Using coconut products could also lead to a different taste within the chocolate. This could allow the design of interesting novel products, but it would also need to be controlled to allow desirable chocolate properties.
