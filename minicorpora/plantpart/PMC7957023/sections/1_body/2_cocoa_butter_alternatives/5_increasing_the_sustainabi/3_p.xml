<p id="p0160">A popular tropical fat that can be used to formulate CBAs is mango kernel fat, which can be obtained through supercritical fluid extraction (
 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Jahurul et al., 2014a</xref>). It is popular because, as a waste product of mango foodstuffs, it is relatively more sustainable than other tropical fats. It also has potential health benefits due to being a free-trans-fat and an antioxidant source (
 <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Jin et al., 2019b</xref>). Chocolates using mango kernel fat have been observed to keep their shape at 32 ​°C, unlike CB-based products, with melting occurring at 37 ​°C because of a high 2-oleoyl-1,3-distearoylglycerol (SOS) content (
 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Jin et al., 2019a</xref>). The use of interesterification of mango kernel fat in chocolate also has the potential to decrease fat bloom as it generates a denser crystal network where plate-like crystals form instead of the classic CB spherulitic crystals (
 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Jin et al., 2019a</xref>). Chocolate with a partial substitution of CB with mango kernel fat (80:20 w/w substitution) was found to show a lower hardness than the control chocolate (
 <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">Naeem et al., 2019</xref>). This study tested fats from different varieties of mango, which showed differences between the rheological properties of each variety, with Lal Badshah having the best behaviour among the varieties (
 <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">Naeem et al., 2019</xref>). This is an important point to bear in mind for all tropical fat-based CBAs as the same may be true for their varieties. Regarding crystallization, blends of mango kernel fat and palm mid-fraction showed orderly packed spherulite crystallization, like CB, with the best melting properties occurring when the mango kernel fat proportion was between 65 and 80% (
 <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Jahurul et al., 2014b</xref>). As previously mentioned, palm oil tends to be unsustainable, therefore mixing it with mango kernel fat could give a palm oil-based CBAs a better structure as well as improved sustainability. A further way to decrease the fat content of chocolate using mango kernel fat is by using it in a gelatine based emulsion gel structure with CB (
 <xref rid="bib88" ref-type="bibr">Sagiri et al., 2014</xref>). However, this structure caused the fat crystals to not fully transform into a β polymorph, reducing the shelf life of the chocolate product (
 <xref rid="bib88" ref-type="bibr">Sagiri et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, the use of gelatine to form such gel would make the chocolate product unsuitable for vegetarians and vegans.
