<p id="p0155">While one can formulate CBEs and CBSs that can be successfully included in chocolate, there may still be some drawbacks, including the poor sustainability of certain compounds, for example palm oil (
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Azhar et al., 2017</xref>). A way to tackle this is by using high oleic sunflower oil or high oleic-high steric sunflower oil. Sunflowers can be grown in more temperate climates and can provide a more sustainable alternative to fat extracted from tropical plants. 
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Bootello et al. (2012)</xref> used high oleic-high stearic sunflower oil with palm mid-fraction to produce a CBE that is more compatible with CB than just sunflower oil on its own. Without the palm mid-fraction, this CBE would not contain significant amounts of -oleoyl-1-palmitoyl-3-stearoylglycerol (POS) and POP, which would negatively affect the crystallization behaviour (
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Bootello et al., 2012</xref>). In fact, POS is important in CB crystallization as its stability and content were found to dictate CB polymorphism stability (

 <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Kadivar et al. (2014)</xref> showed using only interesterified high oleic sunflower oil with CB that the amount of form V CB crystals decreased with increasing the content of the CBE because of the slower crystal growth rate in mixtures compared to pure CB. High oleic-high stearic sunflower oil has also been shown to provide more compatible physiochemical properties with CB than high oleic sunflower oil (
 <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Kadivar et al., 2016</xref>). An earlier study looked at olive pomace oil and using enzymatic interesterification to produce a CBA without any palm fats (
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Ciftci et al., 2009</xref>). However, increasing the concentration of olive pomace oil in the produced CBA also decreased the content of the major CB fatty acids, which led to a decrease in the oxidative stability of the blend and a reduced shelf life. These examples show how challenging it is to form a sustainable CBA with all the desired properties.
