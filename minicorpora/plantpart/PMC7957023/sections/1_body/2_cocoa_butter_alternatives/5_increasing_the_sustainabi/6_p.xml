<p id="p0175">Other possible sustainable plants to consider for CBAs are wild mango (with a close triacylglyceride composition to CB), Cinnamomum camphora seed oil and bambangan kernel fat (

The sustainability, price, and comparable properties to CB need to be considered for each of these novel ingredients to determine their viability. As mentioned previously, these decisions are all subject to the location of the chocolate manufacturing and consumption. For example, coconut fats may be more sustainable in India but not elsewhere. Therefore, location is important when deciding the CBA to use in a chocolate formulation.
