    <td>Cocoa butter equivalent (CBE)</td>
    <td>A plant-based fat, which does not contain lauric acid, used in part or wholly instead of CB and displaying similar characteristics. When mixed with CB, it does not affect the functionality of CB in chocolate.</td>

    <td>Cocoa butter substitutes (CBS)</td>
    <td>Plant fats that contain lauric acid and other fatty acids compositions not found in CB. This makes them unable to mix with CB so can only display acceptable properties with full CB substitution.</td>
