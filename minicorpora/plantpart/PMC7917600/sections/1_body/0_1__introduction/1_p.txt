0: Plant essential oils are now recognized as effective alternatives to synthetic insecticides against a wide variety of pests.
1: Their generally pleasant aroma, relatively low toxicity to humans and pets, and perceived salubrious qualities have given rise to a large increase in research focused on the development of these agents for pest control [ 1].
2: The consumer market has also seen a shift from synthetic insecticides to natural ingredients, as many of these bioactive chemistries are either safer to humans and/or the environment, or perceived to be so [ 2, 3, 4].
3: However, despite the benefits of their use, it is erroneous to assume that all products containing plant essential oils and plant extracts act similarly.
4: To truly appreciate their value, it is necessary to examine their toxic/repellent effects in order to identify the most efficacious chemistries that could be included in future arthropod control technologies [ 2].
