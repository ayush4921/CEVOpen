0: The goal of this study was to assess the ability of various plant essential oils to improve the toxicity of natural pyrethrins against  Aedes aegypti of the insecticide-susceptible Orlando strain.
1: For this, we acquired 20 plant essential oils and screened them alone and in combination with natural pyrethrins at discrete doses to characterize their potential to improve knockdown and lethality.
2: To identify and quantify synergism produced by various plant essential oils, we utilized a co-toxicity factor method proposed by Mansour et al.
3: [ 10].
4: After calculating the co-toxicity factor for various doses of plant essential oils applied in combination with natural pyrethrins, we calculated traditional synergism ratios for selected oils to evaluate the co-toxicity factor method as a diagnostic tool for the identification of novel synergists.
