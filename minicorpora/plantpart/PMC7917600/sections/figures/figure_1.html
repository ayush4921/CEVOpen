 <caption> Synergism ratios of LD 50 values (SR) plotted against co-toxicity factors (CTF) obtained at ( A) 2 µg/insect and ( B) 10 µg/insect, along with linear regression analysis. Strong linear correlation value was observed for the 2 µg/insect (Pearson’s correlation coefficient r = 0.94), whereas at 10 µg/insect moderate linear correlation was observed (Pearson’s correlation coefficient r = 0.64). </caption>
