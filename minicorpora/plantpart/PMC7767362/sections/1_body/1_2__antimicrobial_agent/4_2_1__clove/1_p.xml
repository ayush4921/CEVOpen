<p>Clove (
 <italic>Syzygium aromaticum)</italic>, from the 
 <italic>Myrtaceae</italic> family, is one of the most effective antimicrobial and antioxidant herbs. This herb is one of the traditional herbs primarily local to Asia and Africa. Based on the bioactive components of clove such as eugenol, eugenyl acetate, α-humulene, 2-heptanone, and β-caryophyllene, it can display many pharmacological activities such as antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimutagenic, anticancer, and anti-allergic properties. These bioactive components allow clove to demonstrate one of the highest potent antioxidant activities among other herbal medicines. Previous studies have reported the sufficient antibacterial property of clove extract and oil against different strains of bacteria (Gram-positive and Gram-negative) [

 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S. Typhimurium</italic> [

The antimicrobial mechanism of action of eugenol is that, at first, the eugenol molecule with high solubility can participate in the cytoplasmic membrane. Then, it creates disturbance as a consequence of its OH group. Finally, it can pass through the hydrophilic proportion of the cell. After that, the OH group of eugenol can bind to proteins of the membrane of bacteria and can permeate the fundamental cell components [

 <xref rid="B77-antioxidants-09-01309" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Clove extract with various amounts (1 and 3 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) have been demonstrated to experience a great antimicrobial impact on 
 <italic>S. typhi</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> [

 <xref rid="B78-antioxidants-09-01309" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Researchers have also observed that clove’s extract could inhibit the malondialdehyde formation from horse blood plasma oxidation [
 <xref rid="B79-antioxidants-09-01309" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Other researchers have reported the maximum antioxidant activity of clove against DPPH (2, 2-diphenyl-1-picryl hydracyl), than BHA (butylated hydroxyanisole), and BHT (butylated hydroxytoluene) radicals [
 <xref rid="B80-antioxidants-09-01309" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Similarly, the result of one research has shown the antioxidant activity of eugenol of clove extract against DPPH, ABTS and superoxide radicals [
 <xref rid="B81-antioxidants-09-01309" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Other studies have reported strong antioxidant activity of this herb against DPPH when compared to vitamin C [
 <xref rid="B82-antioxidants-09-01309" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. The antiviral activity of this plant has been reported against different viruses such as herpes adenovirus, poliovirus, and coxsackievirus [
 <xref rid="B83-antioxidants-09-01309" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. The high antioxidant activity of clove’s extract and essential oil is related to the chemical content of this herb, like a phenolic compound.
