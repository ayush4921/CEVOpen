<p>In murine models of sarcoma (allogenic sarcoma-180 and syngenic DBA/2-MC.SC-1 fibrosarcoma), significant antitumor activity was claimed for virgaureasaponin E administered in low doses (1 mg/kg/day) [

 <italic>S. virgaurea</italic> L., evaluated on YAC-1 (T cell lymphoma) and P-815 cells (mouse mastocytoma), indicated that the glycosylation pattern (at 3 or 28 carbon atom position) has an influence on the cytotoxicity and that similarly to the antifungal effect, bisdesmosides derived from the polygalacic acid tend to be more active than their related prosapogenins [
