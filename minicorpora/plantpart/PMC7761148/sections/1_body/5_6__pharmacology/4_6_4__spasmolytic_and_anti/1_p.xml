<p>Ex vivo data obtained on isolated smooth muscles from guinea pig gut showed a modest spasmolytic effect for a 
 <italic>S. virgaurea</italic> ethanol extract (less than 15% of the papaverine effect) [

 <xref rid="B124-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. As mentioned below, extracts of 
 <italic>S. virgaurea</italic> have demonstrated anti-muscarinic effects on isolated bladder, inhibiting the M2 and M3 receptors [
 <xref rid="B31-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. It has been stated that all species of the genus have “hypotensive activity”, including 
 <italic>S. virgaurea</italic>, which demonstrated such an effect in dogs, for a leaf extract, at a dose of 150/kg [

 <xref rid="B125-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>,
 <xref rid="B126-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>]. Aqueous extracts from flowers and from leaves, administered by i.v. route in rats, at doses of 180 and 360 mg/kg found no reduction of blood pressure after the first 2–5 min, for both extracts [
 <xref rid="B127-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>], despite isolated interpretations to the contrary [
 <xref rid="B119-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. This has been speculatively related to a potential contribution of flavonoids, based on the reported vasodilatory effects mediated by the inhibition of protein kinase C resulting in the relaxation of the arterial smooth muscle [
 <xref rid="B97-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. In that study, flavonols had a stronger effect than flavones, which in their turn had a more potent effect than flavanols [
 <xref rid="B97-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>], and as shown above, 
 <italic>S. virgaurea</italic> key flavonoids are derivatives of flavonols (quercetin and kaempferol).
