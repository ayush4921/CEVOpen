<p>The multivariate analysis was performed using the Minitab
 <sup>®</sup> software, version 18.1 (Minitab Inc, State College, PA, USA), using as variables the chemical components that are exhibited at least once in the composition of the cultivars and can reach above 1%. The data matrix was standardized by subtracting the mean from the individual value of each compound and then subtracting it by the standard deviation. The Euclidian distance, complete linkage, and absolute correlation coefficient distance were selected to obtain the similarity of the cultivars for the hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA). For total phenolics determination, total carotenoids, and PAL activity, in each sample, three independent tests were performed, and the results were expressed as mean ± standard deviation. The data were submitted to a normality test for validation (ANOVA), and subsequently, the Tukey’s test was applied with a 5% probability level (
