<p>Homology models for each of the

 <uri xlink:href="http://www.rcsb.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.rcsb.org/</uri>) using FASTA sequences obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) protein database (

 <xref rid="ijms-22-00890-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Protein sequences in the NCBI GenBank with high sequence similarity to structures in the PDB were identified using the PSI-BLAST utility with the BLOSUM80 scoring matrix. Structures with both high similarity to the selected sequence, in addition to a good overlap with the active sites for the protein, were selected for single-reference homology modeling. The protein sequence was then aligned to its respective structural template using the BLOSUM62 substitution matrix. As necessary, either the FASTA sequence or the reference sequence was extended with gaps. Protein structures were generated by the alignment of atomic coordinates of the peptide sequence with those of the template backbone. Side-chain orientations were carried out using the AMBER14:EHT force field with reaction field solvation [

 <xref rid="B114-ijms-22-00890" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. The protein structure with the lowest deviation from the template backbone was selected and optimized using a constrained minimization. The sequence of each structure was aligned to its respective template and the protein backbone was created and superposed to the reference structures using the protein alignment tool in MOE 2019.01 (Chemical Computing Group, Montreal, QC, Canada).
