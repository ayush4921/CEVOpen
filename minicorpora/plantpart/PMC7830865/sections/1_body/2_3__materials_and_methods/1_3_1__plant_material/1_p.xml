 <italic>Piper nigrum</italic> L. (Piperaceae) were provided by EMBRAPA Amazônia Oriental (Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation). The plants were acclimatized and maintained in a greenhouse with a daily watering regime. Adult leaves were collected during the fruiting stage and stored at −20 °C for further experimentation. For the fruits, the collection time varied from July to October, according to its ripeness for each cultivar. After harvesting, the fruits were sun-dried for about three days until the humidity was around 13%, and preserved at room temperature for further experimentation.
