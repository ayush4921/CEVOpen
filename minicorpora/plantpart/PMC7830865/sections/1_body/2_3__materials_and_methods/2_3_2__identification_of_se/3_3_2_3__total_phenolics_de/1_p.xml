<p>The extracts were solubilized in methanol (20 mg·mL
 <sup>−1</sup>), followed by dilution in distilled water. Then, an aliquot of 500 μL of extract was added to 250 μL of Folin–Ciocalteu reagent (1 N) and 1250 μL of sodium carbonate (75 g·L
 <sup>−1</sup>). The reaction was kept in the dark and after 30 min, the absorbance of the mixture was read at 760 nm using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, UK). The experimental calibration curve was prepared using gallic acid (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) at concentrations of 0.5 to 10.0 mg·L
 <sup>−1</sup>, and the content of total phenolics was expressed as gallic acid equivalents (GAE) in milligrams per gram of extract (mg GAE·g
 <sup>−1</sup>).
