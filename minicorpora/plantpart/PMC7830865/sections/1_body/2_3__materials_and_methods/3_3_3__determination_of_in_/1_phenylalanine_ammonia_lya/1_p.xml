<p>Frozen fresh leaves of each cultivar were pulverized in liquid nitrogen. Each sample (100 mg) was homogenized in sodium borate buffer (0.3 mM, pH 8.8), 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), and 5% polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVP) (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), totalizing 1 mL of extraction buffer. The samples were centrifuged at 12,000×

After 15 min at room temperature, the absorbance was measured at 290 nm using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, UK). The specific molar extinction coefficient of (
