0: Therefore, this study aims to identify the secondary metabolic profile in the  P. nigrum cultivars cultivated in the Para State (Brazil), and to evaluate the potential volatile phytoalexins by molecular docking analysis on  Fusarium protein targets.
1: The discrimination and characterization of the cultivars in chemical groups can give more insight into plantpathogen interactions, so as to develop new strategies in plant disease control.
