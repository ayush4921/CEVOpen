<p>The soil-borne pathogens

 <italic>piperis</italic> and 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> are the most notably responsible for the fungal diseases in black pepper that negatively interfere in its fruit production and the plant quality [

 <xref rid="B40-ijms-22-00890" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Moreover, they cause significant yield loss due to the severe damage, since they do not present apparent symptoms in the initial phase of infection [
 <xref rid="B41-ijms-22-00890" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Strategies of control have not been totality efficient in treating and preventing black pepper diseases. In this sense, the metabolomic analysis of black pepper cultivars combined with molecular docking studies is presented in this study. The results can be employed as an alternative in target prediction for developing new natural fungicidal agents based on their mechanisms of proteinâ€“ligand interactions.
