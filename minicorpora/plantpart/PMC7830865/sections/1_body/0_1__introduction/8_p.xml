<p>Therefore, this study aims to identify the secondary metabolic profile in the 
 <italic>P. nigrum</italic> cultivars cultivated in the Pará State (Brazil), and to evaluate the potential volatile phytoalexins by molecular docking analysis on 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> protein targets. The discrimination and characterization of the cultivars in chemical groups can give more insight into plant–pathogen interactions, so as to develop new strategies in plant disease control.
