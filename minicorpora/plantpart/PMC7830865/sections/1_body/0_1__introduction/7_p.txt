0: The soil-borne pathogens  Fusarium solani f.sp.
1: piperis and  F. oxysporum are the most notably responsible for the fungal diseases in black pepper that negatively interfere in its fruit production and the plant quality [ 39, 40].
2: Moreover, they cause significant yield loss due to the severe damage, since they do not present apparent symptoms in the initial phase of infection [ 41].
3: Strategies of control have not been totality efficient in treating and preventing black pepper diseases.
4: In this sense, the metabolomic analysis of black pepper cultivars combined with molecular docking studies is presented in this study.
5: The results can be employed as an alternative in target prediction for developing new natural fungicidal agents based on their mechanisms of proteinligand interactions.
