 <xref rid="B36-ijms-22-00890" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In the literature, several studies show the effectiveness of plant extracts against different pathogens. However, more detailed analysis is required to understand compounds that are directly responsible for the antimicrobial activity and their protein–ligand interaction mechanisms [

Thus, molecular docking analysis has become an important tool to evaluate small-molecule ligands’ potential interactions with protein targets. The results can lead to the elucidation of biologically active agents’ mechanisms from plant sources that can assist in natural-product drug discovery against different pathogens [
