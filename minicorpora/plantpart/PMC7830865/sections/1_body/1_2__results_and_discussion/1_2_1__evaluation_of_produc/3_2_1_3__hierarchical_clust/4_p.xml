<p>PCA analysis of volatile profiles was able to distinguish fourteen 
 <italic>Citrus</italic> varieties as tolerant and moderately tolerant from those susceptible to 
 <italic>Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus</italic> (CLas). Tolerant and moderately tolerant cultivars showed higher amounts of volatiles than susceptible varieties. These compounds include aldehydes (undecanal, neral, geranial, and citronellal) and some monoterpenes such as linalool (0.1–68.3%), d-limonene (0.3–55.3%), myrcene (0.1–8.5%), α- (0.2–3.1%) and β-phellandrene (0.1–11.4%) [
