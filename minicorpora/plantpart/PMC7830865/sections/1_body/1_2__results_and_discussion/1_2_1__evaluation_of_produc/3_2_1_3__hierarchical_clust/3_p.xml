 <xref rid="B79-ijms-22-00890" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Principal component analysis (PCA) and HCA techniques classified the EOs from five varieties of 
 <italic>P. betle</italic> into three groups. Group I, which englobes “Misti” and “BARI Paan 3” varieties, presented chavicol (3.97–11.95%), (
 <italic>E</italic>)-β-caryophyllene (4.24–4.69%), and valencene (3.02–3.11%). Group II was composed only of the variety “Bangla” due to the presence of eugenyl acetate (1.50%) and α-humulene (1.35%) in its composition. The varieties “Sanchi” and “Khasia” were separated in Group III, which was characterized by γ-muurolene (1.74–4.49%) and (
 <italic>E</italic>)-β-caryophyllene (1.74–4.93%) in their compositions [
