<p>Previous studies reported the different degrees of the susceptibility of black pepper cultivars to 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> (yellow wilt) [
 <xref rid="B24-ijms-22-00890" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B82-ijms-22-00890" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>,
 <xref rid="B83-ijms-22-00890" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Our results indicate a possible correlation between resistance to yellow wilt and the volatile composition of the leaves. “Iaçará”, “Kottanadan”, and “Cingapura” (group II) are highly resistant, while “Bragantina” (group IV) and “Uthirankota” (group III) present medium resistance, and “Guajarina” (group I) are more susceptible. Consequently, the cultivar “Equador” may be classified as susceptible due to its high similarity with the cultivar “Guajarina” (99.2%). Furthermore, the variety “Clonada” may have a medium resistance due to its proximity to the cultivar “Uthirankota” (98.1%) (see
