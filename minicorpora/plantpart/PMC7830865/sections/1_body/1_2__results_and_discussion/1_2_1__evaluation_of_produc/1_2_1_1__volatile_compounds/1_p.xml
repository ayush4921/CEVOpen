 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-22-00890">Supplementary Material, Table S1</xref>), representing an average of 98.7% of the total composition. The predominance of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons was observed in the cultivars “Cingapura” (58.48 ± 0.94%), “Equador” (59.35 ± 5.45%), “Guajarina” (71.81 ± 4.47%), “Iaçará” (90.90 ± 1.03%), and “Kottanadan” (74.63 ± 2.38%). On the other hand, the cultivars “Bragantina” (50.55 ± 10.35%), “Clonada” (60.90 ± 3.58%), and “Uthirankota” (75.01 ± 7.89%) presented oxygenated sesquiterpenoids as the majority. The high variability of chemical composition among the cultivars can be attributed to environmental factors such as growth and development, and whether biotic or abiotic, which also directly influence the intensity of the aroma [
