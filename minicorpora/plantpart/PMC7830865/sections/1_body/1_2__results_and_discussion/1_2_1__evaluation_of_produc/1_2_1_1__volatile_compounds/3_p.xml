<p>In the “Cingapura” cultivar, sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (58.48 ± 0.94%) were predominant, followed by oxygenated sesquiterpenoids (20.36 ± 0.80%). The major components identified were δ-elemene (37.17 ± 1.90%) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00890-f001">Figure 1</xref>B), linalool (6.75 ± 0.37%), spathulenol (5.85% ± 0.48%), (
 <italic>E</italic>)-β-caryophyllene (5.72 ± 0.93%), and muurola-4,10(14)-dien-1-β-ol (4.83 ± 0.64%). “Iaçará” and “Kottanadan” cultivars displayed similar chemical profiles with quantitative differences. The main compounds were δ-elemene (50.89 ± 1.64% and 32.1% ± 7.44%), β-elemene (9.92 ± 0.58% and 6.10 ± 1.32%), viridiflorene (8.87 ± 0.84% and 12.42 ± 2.28%), and β-selinene (8.17 ± 0.57% and 7.54 ± 2.59%) for the “Iaçará” and “Kottanadan” cultivars, respectively. In black pepper, δ-elemene (53.3%) was previously reported as the main component in the leaves of “Cingapura” cultivar. The other main constituents identified in the cultivar were (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00890-f001">Figure 1</xref>C) and α-bisabolol (17.97 ± 0.97%) were identified as the main components. In black pepper, α-bisabolol (32.3%) and elemol (11.4%) were identified in the leaves of cultivar “Bragantina” [
