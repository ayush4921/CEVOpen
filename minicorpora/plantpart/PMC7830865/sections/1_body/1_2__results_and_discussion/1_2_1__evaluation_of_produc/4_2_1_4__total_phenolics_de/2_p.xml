<p>The levels of total phenolics were higher in the leaves in comparison to the fruits. These differences can be related to the harvesting and processing steps involved in sun-drying, which alter the interaction between the enzymes related to phenolic production in the black pepper fruits [

 <xref rid="B86-ijms-22-00890" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Six black pepper varieties (“Sreekara”, “Subhakara”, “IISR Malabar Excel”, “Panniyur-1”, “Panchami” and “IISR Thevam”), and other 
 <italic>Piper</italic> species (
 <italic>P. chaba</italic> Hunter, 
 <italic>P. longum</italic> L., and 
 <italic>P. colubrinum</italic> Link.) were extracted with 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane, chloroform, methanol, and water. Methanol extracts from “IISR Malabar Excel” and “Panchami” varieties, and a chloroform extract of 
 <italic>P. colubrinum</italic> displayed higher phenolic contents, with values of 50.85, 38.74, and 100.6 mg GAE·g
 <sup>−1</sup> of the extract [

Therefore, our findings suggest that black pepper cultivars cultivated in the Pará State, Brazil have high phenolic contents compared to other cultivars from other regions of the world, and the extracts may present several biological activities.
