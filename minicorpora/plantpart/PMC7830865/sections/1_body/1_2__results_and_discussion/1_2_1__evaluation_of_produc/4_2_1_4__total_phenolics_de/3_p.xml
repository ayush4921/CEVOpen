<p>Plants that are under biotic or abiotic stresses can exhibit changes in their phenolic contents in the early stages of development [

 <italic>F. solani</italic> f. sp. 
 <italic>piperis</italic>, showed a significant variation in total phenolics in the leaves and roots from the “Cingapura” cultivar (tolerant to 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic>), which can be attributed to the response to the infection in the early stages, since the first symptoms were noted after two weeks of inoculation [

Moreover, the association of the “Bragantina” cultivar of black pepper with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) induced an increase in phenolic content, which was correlated to changes in enzymatic activity linked to metabolic pathways related to plant defense. These findings suggest that AMF can induce a better resistance to pathogens [
