<p>In plants, the carotenoids are involved in different areas, such as antioxidants, accessory pigments that absorb light, and molecules that act as attractants for pollinators and seed dispersers, in addition to the plant response to environmental stresses [

An increase in carotenoid concentration was observed in the black pepper cultivar “Panniyur 1”, which is tolerant to drought stress, suggesting a relationship between the production of these compounds and the mechanisms of tolerance to stress [

Another study showed the effect of natural growth promoters on the physiological and biochemical development of the cultivar “Panniyur 1” of black pepper, and displayed an increase of 159% in total carotenoids compared with the control group. Therefore, species that have access to a greater amount of the nutrients essential to plant growth also tend to have a higher concentration of carotenoids [
