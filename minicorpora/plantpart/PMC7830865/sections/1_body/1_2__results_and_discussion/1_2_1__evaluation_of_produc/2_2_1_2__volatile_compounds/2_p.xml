<p>The EO chemical composition of black pepper cultivars can present quantitative and qualitative differences according to their geographic occurrence. For example, in cultivars from India (“Indigenous” and “Kerala”), quantitative variations in amounts of α-pinene (7.3–16.7%), β-pinene (13.2–13.6%) and limonene (15.2–16.2%), δ-3-carene (9.2–32.6%), α-phellandrene (2.9–8.9%), and (
 <italic>E</italic>)-β-caryophyllene (10.7–18.4%) were observed [
