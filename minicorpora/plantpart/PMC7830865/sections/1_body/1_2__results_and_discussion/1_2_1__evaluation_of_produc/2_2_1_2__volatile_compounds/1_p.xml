 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-22-00890">Supplementary Material, Table S2</xref>). Monoterpene hydrocarbons (average of 76.1%) were predominant in all cultivars, such as α-pinene (6.91–10.67%), β-pinene (22.61–35.05%) and limonene (21.0–31.77%). The presence of α-pinene, β-pinene, and limonene (

Despite different geographical regions, the pungency and flavor of black pepper fruits are related to these compounds, with variations only in their percentages among the cultivars [
