<p>An increase in PAL activity can result from a sensitive response that occurs in plants when they are infected by pathogens or during an injury [

 <xref rid="B100-ijms-22-00890" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. Significant changes in PAL activity were observed in the cultivars “Cingapura” and “Trau” of black pepper, two days after infection with 
 <italic>Phytophthora capsici</italic>. The results showed that PAL causes an immediate response in the production of defense metabolites when the plant is under stress [

 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic>) and two strains of endophytic fungi (
 <italic>Trichoderma viride</italic> and 
 <italic>Trichoderma asperellum</italic>), an increase in PAL activity induced the systemic resistance of black pepper against 
 <italic>P. capsici</italic> [
