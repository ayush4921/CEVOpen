<p>In an attempt to correlate volatile phytoalexins with 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> resistance, we have carried out a molecular docking analysis of the major 
 <italic>P. nigrum</italic> volatile components with 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> protein targets that were available from the Protein Data Bank (PDB): 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> cutinase (PDB 5AJH), 
 <italic>F. solani</italic> cutinase (PDB 1AGY, 1XZL, and 1XZM), 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> endoglucanase (PDB 4OVW), 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> feruloyl esterase (PDB 6FAT), and 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> xylanase (PDB 5JRM). In addition, 
 <italic>F. solani</italic> ornithine decarboxylase was prepared by homology modeling using murine ornithine decarboxylase (PDB 7ODC) as a template, 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> glucosamine-fructose-6-phosphate aminotransferase was prepared from human glutamine fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (PDB 6R4E) as a template, 
 <italic>F. odoratissimum</italic> β-glucosidase was prepared using 
 <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> β-glucosidase (PDB 5NBS) as the template, 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit β was prepared using human guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit α1 (PDB 6CMO) as the template, and 
 <italic>F. vanettenii</italic> thiamine thiazole synthase was prepared using 
 <italic>N. crassa</italic> thiazole synthase (PDB 3JSK) as the template. Docking energies for the essential oil ligands and 10 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> target proteins are listed in
