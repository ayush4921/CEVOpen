<p>The major components found in the 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic>-resistant 
 <italic>P. nigrum</italic> cultivars (“Cingapura”, “Iaçará”, and “Kottanadan”) were δ-elemene (abundant in all three cultivars), viridiflorene, β-selinene, β-elemene (abundant in “Iaçará” and “Kottanadan”), spathulenol and (
 <italic>E</italic>)-β-caryophyllene (abundant in “Cingapura”). δ-Elemene, viridiflorene, β-elemene, and (
 <italic>E</italic>)-β-caryophyllene, all showed selective docking (most exothermic docking energies) to 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> endoglucanase. Furthermore, 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> endoglucanase had the lowest docking average energy for the 40 essential oil components, and was the most targeted protein with 13 ligands showing preferential docking to this protein. Endoglucanase is one of the enzymes responsible for breaking down cellulose by hydrolyzing the β-1,4-glycosidic bonds in the cellulose polymer [

 <italic>Fusarium</italic>. Interestingly, the essential oil components all dock into a hydrophobic pocket removed from the site of the co-crystallized ligand (4-(β-
 <italic>D</italic>-glucopyranosyloxy)-2,2-dihydroxybutyl propanoate) but still in the active canyon of the enzyme (
