<p>The present study detailed the qualitative and quantitative composition of volatile concentrates from the leaves and fruits of black pepper cultivars, which revealed about 218 components (114 in the leaves and 104 in the fruits). HCA analysis allowed the chemical discrimination of the cultivars based on the biomarkers identified in the aroma of the leaves. Differences among the cultivars were also observed in the total phenolics content, PAL activity, and total carotenoids. Although molecular docking was used to evaluate the potential inhibition of 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> enzyme targets, and 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> endoglucanase was identified as a potential enzyme target, there are several other mechanisms of anti-
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> activity that may be important. Nevertheless, it was possible to correlate the metabolomic analysis with the susceptibility degree to yellow wilt of black pepper cultivars available in the State of Par√°, Brazil, and the results highlight the importance of secondary metabolites in understanding the interaction of plants with different environments for the development of new biotechnologies.
