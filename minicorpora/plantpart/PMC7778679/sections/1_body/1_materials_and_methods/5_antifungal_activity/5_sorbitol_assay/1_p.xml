<p>To evaluate the interactions of EO and ME+EO with the fungal cell wall, microplates were prepared as described in the MIC determination experiments, according to protocol M27-A3,
 <xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> with some modifications. EO and ME-EO were added to microplates at concentrations ranging from 1,000 μg/mL to 0.48 μg/mL. One hundred microliters of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> (ATCC 102331 and CAV) suspensions (10
 <sup>3</sup> cells/mL), prepared in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 0.8 M sorbitol, were added. Medium without sorbitol was used as a control. Microplates were incubated at 35°C and readings were performed after 2 and 7 d.
