<p>The binding of EO and ME+EO to membrane ergosterol in 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> was evaluated according to the method described by Peixoto et al
 <xref rid="cit0028">28</xref> (2017). Microplates were prepared according to protocol M27-A3,
 <xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> with some modifications. EO and ME+EO were evaluated at concentrations ranging from 5000 μg/mL to 2.44 μg/mL. 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> (ATCC 102331 and CAV) suspensions (10
 <sup>3</sup> cells/mL) were prepared (100 µL) in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 200 μg/mL exogenous ergosterol. Medium without exogenous ergosterol was used as a control. Microplates were incubated at 35°C and readings were performed after 2 d.
