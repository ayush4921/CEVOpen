 <italic>C. albicans</italic> ATCC 10231 was used in this study. Initially, the pseudoestrus hormonal phase was induced in mice by subcutaneous administration (0.1 mL) of estradiol (Sigma-Aldrich) at a concentration of 2 mg/mL, at 6 and 3 days prior to infection (initial day). On the initial day, 20 μL of a 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> suspension containing 2.5 × 10
 <xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> cells/mL was inoculated into the vaginal environment. At day 1, treatments (20 μL administered/animal) were initialized (once/day) and additional treatments were administered on days 3, 5, and 7. On days 2, 4, and 6, estradiol administration was continued to maintain the pseudoestrous phase. On days 2, 4, 6, and 8, vaginal lavages were performed with PBS.

 <xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> The infection was monitored by individual vaginal lavage of the mice (70 μL of sterile PBS), with repeated aspiration, shaking, and subsequent plating on Sabouraud agar + chloramphenicol (Acumedia, Lansing, MI, USA) to determine the number CFUs. After 48 h of incubation of the agar plates at 37°C, the colonies were counted. Colony counts are expressed as log CFU/mL.
