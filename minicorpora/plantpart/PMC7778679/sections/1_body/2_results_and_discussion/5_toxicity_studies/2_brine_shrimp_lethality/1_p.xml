 <xref rid="t0008" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref> shows the lethal concentration (LD

 <xref rid="cit0070" ref-type="bibr">70–72</xref> However, the results of this study showed that EO was not toxic against brine shrimp nauplii, with LD
 <sub>50</sub> values higher than 1000 μg/mL. Moreover, brine shrimp nauplii treated with ME+EO and ME were found to be viable, with LD
 <sub>50</sub> values &gt;30 μg/mL, which was the highest tested concentration of these formulations in this assay.
