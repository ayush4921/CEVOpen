<p>The citronellal concentration calculated from the analytical curve (area = 5,575,407, R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.997) was 2.653 mg/mL, which corresponds to a citronellal concentration in the EO of 26.5% (w/w). The citronellol concentration (area = 2,196,889, R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.996) was 1.116 mg/mL, which can be expressed as 11.1%. The geraniol concentration (area = 4,318,673, R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.997) was 2.458 mg/mL, which corresponded to 24.6%. These values are consistent with the quantification from the chromatogram peak area normalization method by GC-MS.
