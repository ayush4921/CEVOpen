<p>Identification of the chemical compounds in the EO responsible for antimicrobial activity is difficult, since the essential oils are complex mixtures with different chemical compounds that can act synergistically.

 <xref rid="cit0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> A previous study has shown that the EO of 
 <italic>C. nardus</italic> has greater antifungal activity against planktonic cells of 
 <italic>Candida</italic> species than citronellal, which is its main chemical compound. This indicates a possible synergic action among the chemical compounds present in the EO.
