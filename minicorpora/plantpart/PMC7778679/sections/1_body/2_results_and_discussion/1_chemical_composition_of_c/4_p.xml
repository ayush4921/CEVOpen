<p>This EO chemical profile corroborated the results of a previous study that showed a citronellal concentration of 27.87% in the EO of 
 <italic>C. nardus</italic> (Toledo et al, 2016), which is similar to the concentration found in this study (27.34%) and in a study by Wei and Wee (2013),
 <xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> which reported a citronellal concentration of 29.6%. Studies performed by Kandimalla et al
 <xref rid="cit0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> (2016) in India and Nakahara et al
 <xref rid="cit0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> (2003) in Japan showed low concentrations of citronellal in the OE of 
 <italic>C. nardus</italic> (6.06% and 5.8%, respectively). Kandimalla et al
 <xref rid="cit0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> (2016) found that the main constituents were citral (38.75%) and 2,6-octadienal,3,7-dimethyl (31.02%) and Nakahara et al
 <xref rid="cit0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> (2003) reported geraniol as the main chemical component, with a concentration of 35.7%.
