<p>A phase diagram (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1</xref>) was constructed to demonstrate the 36 points of formulations obtained from the mixtures of different constituents and a visual classification was evaluated for each formulation. The formulations were visually classified as a transparent liquid system (TLS), an opaque liquid system (OLS), a semi-transparent liquid system (STLS), a phase separation (PS), a transparent viscous system (TVS), an opaque viscous system (OVS), or a semi-transparent viscous system (STVS). Therefore, different regions of the phase diagram were delineated and the best formulation for loading the essential oil in the ME was selected. The ME with the TLS characteristic (circled red point – Point 9) was chosen for use in in vitro and in vivo assays. It was composed of 70% PBS, 20% Brij35 + soy phosphatidylcholine (2:1), and 10% grape seed oil. The EO (2000 µg/mL) was loaded in the ME (point 9, ME+EO).
