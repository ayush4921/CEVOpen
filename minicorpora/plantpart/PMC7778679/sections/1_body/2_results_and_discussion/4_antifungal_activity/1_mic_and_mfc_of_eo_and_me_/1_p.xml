<p>The MIC and MFC results for EO and ME+EO are shown in 
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. The EO showed antifungal activity with MIC values of 500 µg/mL and &gt;500 µg/mL against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> ATCC and CAV, respectively. ME+EO showed the lowest MIC (31.2 µg/mL) against CAATCC and CAV (62.5 µg/mL). Thus, the use of an ME considerably improved the action of the EO. The growth control showed satisfactory results, whereas the solvent and ME controls did not show any antifungal activity.
