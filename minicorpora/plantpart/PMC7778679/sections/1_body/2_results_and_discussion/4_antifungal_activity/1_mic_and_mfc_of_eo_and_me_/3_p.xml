<p>The use of nanotechnology as an alternative to improving the antifungal activity of natural products has been used with promising results. In an in vivo study of the prophylactic action of a methanolic extract of 
 <italic>Syngonanthus nitens</italic> (Bong.) Rhulland loaded into a drug delivery system, the prevention of VVC development caused by 
 <italic>C. krusei</italic> was demonstrated.
 <xref rid="cit0062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref> Bonif√°cio et al
 <xref rid="cit0022">22</xref> (2015) studied the antifungal activity of an ethanolic extract from 
 <italic>Astronium urundeuva</italic> (Engl.), unloaded or loaded in an ME, against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> and showed an improvement in the inhibitory capacity of the extract after incorporation into the nanostructured system.
