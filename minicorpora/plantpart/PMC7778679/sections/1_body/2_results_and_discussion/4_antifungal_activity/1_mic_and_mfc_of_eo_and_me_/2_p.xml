<p>Several studies have demonstrated the anti-
 <italic>Candida</italic> activity of EOs.
 <xref rid="cit0056" ref-type="bibr">56–59</xref> The genus 
 <italic>Cymbopogon</italic> has been shown to have effective antifungal activity against pathogenic fungi. A previous study demonstrated the antifungal activity of the EO of 
 <italic>Cymbopogon citratus</italic> against different 
 <italic>Candida</italic> species, showing MIC values ranging from 125 to 175 µg/mL.
 <xref rid="cit0060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref> Another study demonstrated the anti-
 <italic>Candida</italic> action of the EO from 
 <italic>C. nardus</italic> against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, with MIC values ranging from 32 to 64 µg/mL. Furthermore, the EO of 
 <italic>C. nardus</italic> inhibits the adherence of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> to dental implants and cover screws.
