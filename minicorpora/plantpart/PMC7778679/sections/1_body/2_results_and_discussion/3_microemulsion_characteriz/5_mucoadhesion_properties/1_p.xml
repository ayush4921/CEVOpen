<p>Suitable mucoadhesion characteristics are relevant for the attachment of a formulation to vaginal mucosal membranes, in order to promote extended contact between the formulation and the vaginal cavity, thus allowing an increased residence time and bioavailability of the drug. Moreover, adequate mucoadhesion avoids drainage of the formulation outside the vagina, which is an unfortunate condition for users.
