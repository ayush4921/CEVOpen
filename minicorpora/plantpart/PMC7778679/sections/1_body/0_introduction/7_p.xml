Furthermore, citronella EO production occurs on a large scale, which facilitates its use as a raw material for the production of herbal medicines. Furthermore, EO extraction by hydrodistillation shows advantages over the use of organic solvents for the production of plant extracts, as it takes into consideration green chemistry principles,
