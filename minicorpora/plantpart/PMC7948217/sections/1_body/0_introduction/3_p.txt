0: However, the current economy presents an evident dependence on oil and its derivatives; satisfying energy needs with the use of nonrenewable resources results in an unsustainable practice, a situation that is worsening with the increase in world energy consumption.
1: Special attention has been given to the study of biofuels to meet the demand.
2: 2 These products are biodegradable, renewable, nontoxic, and more ecological.
3: 3 In this sense, biofuels have established themselves as an integral alternative to enhance energy generation and pollution mitigation; a positive future is expected for biofuels as they can reduce dependence on fossil fuels, along with reduction of environmental impacts and emissions of polluting chemicals.
4: 4 On the other hand, the biorefinery concept incorporates a wide range of technologies capable of separating biomass into its basic components and converting them by integrating processes and equipment for conversion into value-added products, biofuels, and chemicals.
5: 5 Then, under this concept, it is possible to obtain environmentally friendly fuels, take advantage of residues to manufacture by-products with a high added value, in turn generate economic and energy stability, and reduce negative effects on the environment and health; in other words, biorefinery implementation for biomass valorization provides several benefits due to the diversification of raw materials and products while dealing with sustainability issues.
