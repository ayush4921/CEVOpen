0: The palm rachis is also waste with a great potential to be exploited.
1: Through a gasification process, this biomass will be converted into hydrogen, a fuel with a high added value as a very attractive and feasible project.
2: 9 Gasification is viewed as a potentially beneficial technology for the use of biomass, which converts biomass into combustible gases, biochar, and useful chemicals.
3: 10 It is important to note that the interest in the study of biomass to produce hydrogen is not recent; its advantage as a clean fuel for power generation was a reason for different authors to propose strategies for obtaining it.
4: 11,  12 Hydrogen is considered a novel fuel for the 21st century due to its advantages compared to fossil fuels; studies related to this fuel focus on aspects of efficiency and economy.
5: 13 Our study was conducted with an incremental approach to the economic and exergetic returns of each incorporated process to avoid stages that are not energy-efficient and economically profitable.
