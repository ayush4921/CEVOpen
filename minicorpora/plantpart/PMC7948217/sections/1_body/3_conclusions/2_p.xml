<p>This work is focused on the development of a methodology that provides a new parameter for the stopping criteria against the proposal of extensions in a biorefinery; this parameter is based on the return of incremental economic and exergetic returns on the investment and also allows one to determine the viability of the studied proposal. For this project, an African palm biorefinery is taken as a base. Four study proposals were established: a base case or a palm oil-producing plant and three proposals for extensions defined under aspects of waste use and increased value added to products. The production of palm kernel oil, palm cake, and hydrogen allows the exploration of residues with great economic and energy potential; the units necessary for the production of biodiesel and glycerin provide an added value to palm oil as evidenced in the proposed expansion 4.</p>
