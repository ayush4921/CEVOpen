<p>To improve the rigor and precision of this methodology in the synthesis of biorefineries, future research is recommended where this method is evaluated with other case studies, for example, biorefineries based on sugar cane or corn and/or application of new adjustments and considerations. In addition, more indicators can be included in this parameter such as environmental or safety indicators. We study in detail the production of hydrogen and propose improvements in the tentative resulting process because it is a good alternative economically. Finally, the order in which the extensions or proposals are raised can be studied, determining whether it affects the hydride indicator IExWROI.</p>
