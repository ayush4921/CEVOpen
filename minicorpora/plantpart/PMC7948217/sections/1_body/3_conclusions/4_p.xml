<p>The implementation of the IExWROI yields improvements for cases 2 and 3 concerning the IROI of 38 and 2%, respectively, and case 2 represents the best topology with a maximum percentage of 75%, the impact of the IExROI in case 4. Due to the low exergetic efficiency, it leads to a negative contribution, where the IExWROI is lower than the IROI, with this being the stopping criterion in the synthesis of the biorefinery studied. The applied methodology allows obtaining a stopping criterion by integrating exercise and economic incremental parameters. The IExWROI provides logical results, is easy to interpret, and is comparable with the IROI to determine its feasibility. Then, the parameter allows us to determine the best topology of different proposals of extensions to a case of linear production.
