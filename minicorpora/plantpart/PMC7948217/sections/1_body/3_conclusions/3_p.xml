<p>Economic analyses show improvements in the value of their products as the waste is valued, with an IROI of 42.98%. Case 3 is shown as the best expansion in economic terms, while with 18.19%, case 4 is the expansion with the least contribution to economic performance; under the conditions of the project, the expansion of the plant from an already established product is not justified as in case 4. In exergy aspects, case 2 with an IExROI of 158% is presented as the best alternative with more efficient stages and sustainability, while case 4 with an incremental return of âˆ’7% shows its low contribution to exergy use compared to the case studies. Exergy evaluations are strongly affected by the destruction of exergy by residues and inefficiencies in the stages. Case 4 is unfavorable for both parameters because the expansion does not propose an improvement on waste; it is also evident that waste losses have a considerable influence on the overall efficiency of the processes.</p>
