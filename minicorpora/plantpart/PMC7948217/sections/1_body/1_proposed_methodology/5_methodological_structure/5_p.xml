<p>Now, the proposed case study mass and energy balances are made, following the economic evaluations and exergetic analysis on an incremental basis for each case. A comparative study on the behavior of the parameters concerning the suggested additions is undertaken. Then, it is feasible to specify the inefficient stages and to gain a broader view of the viability of the additions. To estimate the hybrid indicator of biorefinery sizing, it is necessary to calculate the incremental economic return on investment (IROI) and the incremental exergetic return on investment (IExROI). The results of the hybrid indicator determine the viability or percentage of improvement of a process concerning a previous one.</p>
