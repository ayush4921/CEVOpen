<p>Following the development of base case mass and energy balances, the economic evaluation and exergetic analysis of this first case are performed. At this point in the methodology, the economic indicators of the process, price of raw materials, ROI, and recovery period are already available. From the exergetic perspective, it is possible to establish the critical stages and identify the irreversibilities, as well as data on product exergy, input exergy, residue exergy, and industrial utility exergy, in addition to the overall efficiency of the process.</p>
