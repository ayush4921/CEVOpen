<p>The exergy of a thermodynamic system is the maximum useful theoretical work that is possible to obtain as the system enters into thermodynamic equilibrium with the environment.

 </sup> The energy analysis of a process includes balances based on the first law of thermodynamics and calculations of energy efficiency. However, it does not provide information related to energy degradation or quantify the utility or quality of the mass and energy streams of the system under evaluation. For this reason, exergetic analysis is presented as an alternative that overcomes the limitations of the first law of thermodynamics. This analysis reveals the sites of energy degradation in a process and it can contribute to improving a unit operation, a technology, or a process. Therefore, exergetic analysis allows the evaluation and selection of different alternatives to enhance a process design, making it a suitable tool for the analysis of new technologies for advanced biofuel production.
