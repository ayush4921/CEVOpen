<p>Physical exergy is associated with pressure, temperature, enthalpy, and entropy, and it is defined as the work achievable by subjecting a substance to reversible physical processes from an initial temperature and pressure to the state determined by the pressure and temperature of the environment (

  <xref rid="eq19" ref-type="disp-formula">19</xref>
 </xref>). This exergy can vary according to the state or behavior of the stream. For a stream that behaves as an ideal gas with constant

 <xref rid="eq21" ref-type="disp-formula">eq
