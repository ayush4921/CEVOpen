<p>Nevertheless, it is necessary to identify the total exergy inputs in a system or a step, 
 <xref rid="eq24" ref-type="disp-formula">eq 
  <xref rid="eq24" ref-type="disp-formula">24</xref>
 </xref> is applied for this purpose, and it is defined based on the exergy of the incoming streams or flows and the exergetic contributions of the industrial utilities. The total exergy output considers product flows and residue flows (
 <xref rid="eq25" ref-type="disp-formula">eq 
  <xref rid="eq25" ref-type="disp-formula">25</xref>
 </xref>). The exergy destroyed is defined as the potential of the system to produce work that is unused; exergetic losses are irreversibilities provided in 
 <xref rid="eq26" ref-type="disp-formula">eq 
  <xref rid="eq26" ref-type="disp-formula">26</xref>
 </xref> and are calculated, subtracting the exergies of the product flows from the total input exergies of a system. 
 <xref rid="eq27" ref-type="disp-formula">Equations 
  <xref rid="eq27" ref-type="disp-formula">27</xref>
 </xref> and 
 <xref rid="eq28" ref-type="disp-formula">28</xref> allow obtaining the exergetic efficiencies and the percentage of exergy destroyed for a stage regarding the remaining part of the process, respectively.
