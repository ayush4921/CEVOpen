<p>The base case, in blue, includes a plant with a linear production chain for African palm oil. Case study 2, in red, consists of an African palm-based biorefinery for the production of palm oil, palm kernel oil, and palm cake. Case 3, in green, incorporates the production of hydrogen using the African palm rachis, which was previously considered as a waste.
