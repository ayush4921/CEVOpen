<p>The case under study consists of a biorefinery based on African palm, the growth, and importance of this palm in the country and is supported by numerous reports to assess the efficiency, viability, and particularly, the use of waste from its main process (production of palm oil) to achieve high value-added by-products. This projectâ€™s case studies are specified as follows, where the block diagram presents the main stages and the input and output flow of the products, by-products, and residues (
