<p>Since the incremental exergetic return of case 2 is the highest (158%), it was established as the objective IExROI* indicator for the project. According to the results presented in 
 <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="other">Table 
  <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="other">5</xref>
 </xref>, it is possible to identify first the behavior of the exergo-economic weighted incremental return of the investment for case 2, an extension that represents an improvement of 75% compared to case 1. In this initial value, the positive effect of the incremental exergetic criterion on the incremental economic return is notorious; the extension proposed in case 2 should be approved as it exceeds the IROI of the project.
