<p>It is important to highlight the following:
 <list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
   <p>The IExWROI is a parameter that integrates the conventional IROI calculations, generating a value of easy interpretation in the decision-making.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>In case the fractional contribution of the incremental exergetic return becomes zero, the IExWROI will be equal to the economic IROI.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>The IExROIP does not necessarily have to be a positive value since project P is an improvement project and is not always driven by favorable values. The exergetic indicator can generate a positive, negative, or zero impact on the IROI; in this sense, the IExROI can be greater, less, or equal to the IROI.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>If the IExWROI is lower than the IROI, then the company can exclude the project based on the fact that the exergetic indicator affects the IROI. Conversely, if the IExWROI is higher than the IROI, indicating a positive impact, then the project can be approved.</p>
