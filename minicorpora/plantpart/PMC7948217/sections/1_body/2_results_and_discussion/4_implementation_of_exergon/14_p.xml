<p>The IExWROI for case 3 against proposal 2 contributes to a 45% improvement. In this case, the positive effect of the exergetic criterion was not very pronounced and is reasonable since, from a merely exergetic perspective, case 3 contributes only 8% over case 2; this project can be approved as it is superior to the IROI of extension 3. Case 4 presents a particular condition: the IExROI is negative. From an exergetic point of view, it is not convenient to approve the extension. Now, the IExWROI gives an idea of the contribution of this exergetic criterion regarding the IROI of the last case. The new parameter is lower than the IROI, which confirms its negative effect and the punctual reason to avoid extension 4. The IExWROI is an appropriate indicator to evaluate, in a comparative manner, the performance of a proposed extension, becoming a useful tool for perspectives of improvement and process development.

 </sup> It also allows the assessment and articulation of energy and economic efficiency indicators, two aspects that are currently indispensable to determine the viability of a project. IExWROI provides details of synthesis and selection of design alternatives, costâ€“benefit analysis, and exergetic use of extensions proposed under the concept of biorefineries.
