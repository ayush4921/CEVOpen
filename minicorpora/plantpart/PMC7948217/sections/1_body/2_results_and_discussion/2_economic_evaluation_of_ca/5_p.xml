<p>In addition, it is crucial to analyze other indicators such as return on investment (ROI) and years of return on investment; these do not exhibit the same progressive behavior as the other indicators. Results indicate that they decrease in the last case, leading to a lower return on investment at the end of the 15 years in case 4. Special care must be given to the return on investment (ROI) since this parameter analyzes each case in a specific manner, not in a progressive manner, i.e., the ROI does not consider the expansion from one plant to another; therefore, the values obtained do not provide a perspective of improvement compared to a previous project. In this sense, the incremental return of investment (IROI) is implemented, a parameter that accounts for both the TCI of the projects under study and the addition of new units.
