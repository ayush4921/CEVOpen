 </xref> specifies the individual costs that were considered for the TCI calculation in the base case. The most significant cost in the total capital investment consists of the purchase of the equipment; therefore, the FOB (free on board) price of the units involved in the production of palm oil was estimated according to the production capacity and process specifications. The cost of the equipment acquired is a sum of the FOB price estimated plus the transport price. The latter was assumed as 20% of the FOB price; this fraction is variable and depends on local taxes and geographical difficulties, among others. Installation costs represent 12% of the value of the equipment purchased.
