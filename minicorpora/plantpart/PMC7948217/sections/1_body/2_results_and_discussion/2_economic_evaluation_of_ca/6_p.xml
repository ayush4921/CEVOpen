<p>It is observed that as the residues are valorized, the incidence in the IROI is favorable. In case 2, when using the press cake to transform it into palm kernel oil and palm cake, the improvement is 37.47%. Similar behavior is experienced in case 3 using another waste (rachis) from the base case in the production of hydrogen; at this point, three by-products have been achieved from two wastes and it is reflected in the progressive increase in IROI. Case 4 implementation compared to case 3 demonstrates a less favorable behavior in IROI, with a percentage of improvement of 18.19%, since this expansion does not suggest the use of another waste. Although the production of biodiesel and glycerin has palm oil as a raw material (product in the previous cases) and the commercial value of biodiesel is higher than palm oil, the IROI under the considerations made in this work does not justify this investment.</p>
