<p>Case 3 suggests the use of the rachis by adding the necessary units for hydrogen production; these stages include gasifiers, HTS and LTS reactors, an adsorption column for hydrogen purification, and a desorption column for selexol recovery, among other equipment. The overall exergetic efficiency tends to decrease, a result that can be attributed to the number of waste streams where the exergetic potential of biomass and the necessary industrial utilities are not exploited. The criterion of incremental exergetic return of the investment (IExROI) is now developed to analyze the viability or pertinence of adding stages to a base case in terms of energy.</p>
