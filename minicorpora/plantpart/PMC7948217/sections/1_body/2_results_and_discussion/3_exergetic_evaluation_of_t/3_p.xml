<p>The total exergy destroyed from the base case is 139,813 MJ/h, while case 2 presents a slight reduction of 6631 MJ/h. Now, it is evident that cases 3 and 4 exhibit high data of irreversibilities compared to the first two plants under study; 1,552,763 and 2, 838,404 MJ/h are the values, respectively. These values of unused useful energy are closely related to the exergetic losses due to residues in the different expansions, which increase in the final cases.</p>
