 </xref> illustrates the overall exergetic efficiency of each case study. The overall exergetic efficiencies present a behavior that is not expected, and the implementation of new stages for residue utilization should decrease the exergetic losses by residues and therefore increase the overall exergetic efficiency of the process as it occurs when case 2 is implemented through the production of palm kernel oil and palm cake from palm kernel cake (residue of the base case); however, a completely different panorama is emerging when implementing cases 3 and 4.
