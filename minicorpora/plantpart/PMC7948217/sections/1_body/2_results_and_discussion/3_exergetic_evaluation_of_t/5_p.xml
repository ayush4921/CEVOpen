 </xref> represents the contribution in percentages of the major stages to the total irreversibilities for the proposed case studies. In case 1, the stages that report the greatest exergy destruction are sterilization, threshing, and pressing. These three stages together represent 96.26% of exergy destruction, and by implementing proposal 2 for waste use in the pressing unit, this stage goes from an exergy efficiency of 90.42% to 99.53%, demonstrating its low contribution to the total exergy destroyed in case 2.
