<p>Case 3 application is 8% higher than case 2. The additional exergetic requirements of proposal 3 exceed the use of exergy reflected in the products, i.e., to increase 123,106.52 MJ/h in the products, it is necessary to add 1,539,032.64 MJ/h (exergy required). Taking into account the fact that the hydrogen production process involves large amounts of exergy in terms of industrial profits, global input flows, and considerable waste outputs, these factors make the process critical as a proposal for improvement of case 2. However, the IExROI should not be, by itself, a criterion to determine the application of the case; it is very important to consider other factors such as economic factor, for example, to establish its feasibility from different aspects of interest.</p>
