<p>A particular case is proposal 4 to enhance case 3: the results are not favorable from the exergetic point of view. In this case, biodiesel and glycerin obtained from palm oil (the product in the previous cases) are not being used. The total exergy of these two new products is 119,785.92 MJ/h and does not exceed the exergy of palm oil (202,216.20 MJ/h), which implies that there is no increase in exergy of the products when implementing this new case despite the addition of 1,099,498.98 MJ/h for the production and purification processes of biodiesel and glycerin. The application of case 4 is not viable as a prospect for the utilization of useful energy.</p>
