<p>It is also remarkable that peel separation, centrifugation, threshing, and esterification present the highest percentages of irreversibilities in the second case study. These stages contain outputs not used (waste), which justifies their contribution to total irreversibilities. The last three stages mentioned present a greater contribution in terms of percentage. It is pertinent to clarify that the data on irreversibilities in these stages remain the same, but the percentages increase since 100% of total exergy destroyed in case 2 has decreased compared to case 1, and the contribution of pressing is less due to the recovery of its waste and the added stages are very efficient (all above 95% except for shell separation, which is 75.76%).</p>
