<p>Implementing case 2 to the linear production chain provides significant improvements. The additional exergy required to apply this case is 12,571.82 MJ/h, while in the products, it goes from using 202,216 MJ/h to 222,053 MJ/h. The total products of case 2 increase by 19,836.96 MJ/h in comparison with palm oil (the only product in the base case), and then the percentage of improvement of case 2 concerning the base case is 158%, a considerably high value, although it is justified since it increases to a greater extent the exergetic use of products with no need to add a larger amount of exergy required; in other words, the numerator (exergetic difference of products) is greater than the difference in the denominator, which allows an improvement that exceeds 100%.
