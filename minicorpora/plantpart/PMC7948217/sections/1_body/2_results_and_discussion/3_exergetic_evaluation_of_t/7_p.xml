<p>Hydrogen production from the rachis is the focus of the third case study. Using this residue, the fruiting stage goes from 82,587.97 MJ/h of exergy destroyed to 68,381.04 MJ/h; its contribution to the irreversibilities of case 3 is relatively low, although the exergy of the input used is slightly higher. This low contribution is mostly due to the implementation of two very inefficient exergetic stages that generally affect case 3: indirect gasification and hydrogen purification, with exergetic efficiencies of 42.25 and 18.59%, respectively; the first is inefficient due to its complexity in operating conditions and requirements of additional industrial utilities and the second is inefficient due to the output stream that does not contain a product and represents a higher flow compared to the hydrogen output stream. The inefficient stages of case 3 contribute considerably to the total irreversibilities of proposal 4, where a heating stage and transesterification provide for total exergetic destruction.</p>
