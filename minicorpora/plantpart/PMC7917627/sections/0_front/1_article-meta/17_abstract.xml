 <p>The wastage of food products is a major challenge for the food industry. In this regard, the use of edible films and coatings have gained much attention due to their ability to prevent the spoilage of the food products during handling, transport, and storage. This has effectively helped in extending the shelf-life of the food products. Among the various polymers, polysaccharides have been explored to develop edible films and coatings in the last decade. Such polymeric systems have shown great promise in microbial food safety applications. The inclusion of essential oils (EOs) within the polysaccharide matrices has further improved the functional properties of the edible films and coatings. The current review will discuss the different types of polysaccharides, EOs, methods of preparing edible films and coatings, and the characterization methods for the EO-loaded polysaccharide films. The mechanism of the antimicrobial activity of the EOs has also been discussed in brief.</p>
