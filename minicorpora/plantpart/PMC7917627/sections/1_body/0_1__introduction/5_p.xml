<p>A large number of researchers have reported the use of EOs as active agents for the development of AFPMs. In the present review, a discussion on the polysaccharides that have been explored for the development of the EO-containing AFPMs will be made. Then, the mechanism of the antimicrobial activity of EOs, and different types of EOs that has been used for developed AFPMs will be discussed. Lastly, the synthesis and characterization methods of the polysaccharide and EO-based AFPMs will be discussed. </p>
