0: Among the different antimicrobial compounds mentioned above, EOs (e.g., clove oil, lemon oil, cinnamon oil, tea tree oil, lavender oil, oregano oil, and peppermint oil) have evolved as one of the preferred natural antimicrobial compounds for the development of the AFPMs.
1: The EOs are produced by the plants as the secondary metabolites, which are highly lipophilic, volatile, and prone to oxidative and photothermal degradation.
2: Chemically, the EOs are composed of aldehydes, monoterpenes, flavonoids, isoflavones, carotenoids, alkaloids, and phenolic acids.
3: The high lipophilic nature of the EOs makes them insoluble in water.
4: Additionally, the EOs must be handled carefully due to their highly volatile natures.
5: The main advantage of the EOs is their antibacterial activities against a wide spectrum of microbes.
6: Since the EOs are extracted from natural sources, they are generally safe for human consumption.
7: Due to this reason, many of the EOs have been categorized as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the Food and Drug Administration of the United States (US-FDA).
8: The US-FDA has approved many EOs as an additive for food applications.
9: The EOs are usually entrapped (encapsulated) within the polymeric films.
10: The entrapment within the polymeric matrices extensively reduces the volatility of the Eos, thereby improving their efficiency.
11: The polymeric architecture provides a platform that helps in controlling the release of the EOs from the films over the surface of the food in a sustained manner [ 5].
12: Additionally, the use of EOs for the development of the AFPMs significantly increases the contact area with the foods.
13: This is accounted to the hydrophilic nature of the biopolymers.
14: The biopolymers are inherently hydrophilic in nature.
15: Hence, they will prevent the crossover of the hydrophobic EO components, thereby, helping in masking the odor of the EOs.
