<p>Microbial food safety is a grave concern across the globe. This is because several microbes that include bacteria, viruses, and fungi are responsible for causing foodborne diseases. Foodborne diseases have been reported to significantly increase the healthcare cost of developing countries. As evident from the World Health Organization (WHO) report, published in the year 2015, nearly 600 million members of the population were affected by foodborne diseases in the year 2015, while more than 420,000 cases of mortality are being recorded each year across the globe [

The economies of most developing countries are dependent on the export of agricultural products. Hence, the microbial contamination of food products affects the economic growth of these countries, which further increases the economic burden. Keeping this factor in mind, various researchers are working towards the development of sustainable strategies for preventing the microbial contamination of food products. In other words, researchers across the globe have identified that enhancing the microbial safety of food products can drastically help developing countries in saving their economies. In this regard, the development of novel food packaging materials has evolved as a new area of research in food science in the last couple of decades.
