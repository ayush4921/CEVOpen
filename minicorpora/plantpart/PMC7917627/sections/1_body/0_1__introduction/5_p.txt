0: A large number of researchers have reported the use of EOs as active agents for the development of AFPMs.
1: In the present review, a discussion on the polysaccharides that have been explored for the development of the EO-containing AFPMs will be made.
2: Then, the mechanism of the antimicrobial activity of EOs, and different types of EOs that has been used for developed AFPMs will be discussed.
3: Lastly, the synthesis and characterization methods of the polysaccharide and EO-based AFPMs will be discussed.
