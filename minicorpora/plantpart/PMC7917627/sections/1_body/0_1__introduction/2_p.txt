0: Conventionally, food packaging materials (FPMs) are developed using plastics, which account for a sizable amount of petroleum oil consumption.
1: It has been forecasted that by the year 2050, 20% of petroleum oil will be used for the manufacturing of plastics for different applications [ 2].
2: The use of plastics results in the overall carbon emissions of the earth, thereby negatively affecting nature.
3: Hence, scientists are looking towards developing novel FPMs using biological sources that can allow reducing the use of plastics.
4: The materials that are explored for the development of the FPMs include polymers from biological sources.
5: Such materials are generally regarded as bioplastics since they are developed from natural sources.
6: Many of the bioplastics are biodegradable in nature and do not pollute the environment [ 3].
7: The use of agrobiopolymers for the designing of biodegradable FPMs has received much attention in recent times.
8: The agrobiopolymers are classified as polysaccharides, lipids, and proteins [ 4].
9: These polymers are extracted from agrowastes, which in turn further helps to reduce the environmental pollution burden.
10: Many researchers have proposed various polysaccharide-based FPMs in recent times.
11: Some of the commonly used polysaccharides include tamarind gum, chitosan, alginate, carrageenan, etc.
