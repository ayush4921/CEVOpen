<p>Conventionally, food packaging materials (FPMs) are developed using plastics, which account for a sizable amount of petroleum oil consumption. It has been forecasted that by the year 2050, 20% of petroleum oil will be used for the manufacturing of plastics for different applications [

Hence, scientists are looking towards developing novel FPMs using biological sources that can allow reducing the use of plastics. The materials that are explored for the development of the FPMs include polymers from biological sources. Such materials are generally regarded as bioplastics since they are developed from natural sources. Many of the bioplastics are biodegradable in nature and do not pollute the environment [

Many researchers have proposed various polysaccharide-based FPMs in recent times. Some of the commonly used polysaccharides include tamarind gum, chitosan, alginate, carrageenan, etc.
