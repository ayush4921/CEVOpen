<p>Chitosan is synthesized from the naturally occurring biopolymer chitin, by the process of N-deacetylation. Said biopolymer is an alkaline amino polysaccharide, which is the only biopolymer that occurs in nature [
 <xref rid="B9-polymers-13-00575" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The alkaline nature of chitosan can be proven by its solubility in mild acid solutions [
 <xref rid="B10-polymers-13-00575" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The polymer is regarded as the wonder biopolymer due to its inherent antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. This makes the biopolymer a choice of material as a preservative in food industries. Additionally, the biopolymer is well-known for its film-forming ability [
 <xref rid="B11-polymers-13-00575" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The film-forming capability of the films can be ascribed to the formation of the intermolecular interactions among the polymeric chains of the chitosan molecules [
 <xref rid="B10-polymers-13-00575" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Unfortunately, the chitosan-based films and polymeric architectures suffer from poor mechanical properties. This is the major limitation of exploring chitosan-based films for meaningful applications. To circumvent this problem, many researchers have used another component that can help improve the mechanical stability of the chitosan-based polymeric architectures. Some of the components include gelatin, starch, and alginates [
 <xref rid="B9-polymers-13-00575" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Further, different physical and chemical strategies of crosslinking of the chitosan matrices have been proposed to improve their mechanical properties. In recent years, the use of amphiphilic chitosans (e.g., diethylaminoethyl chitosans) has been proposed (
