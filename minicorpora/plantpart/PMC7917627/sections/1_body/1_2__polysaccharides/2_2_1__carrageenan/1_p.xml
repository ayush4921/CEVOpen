<p>Carrageenan is a water-soluble linear-chain polysaccharide. Chemically, the biopolymer is regarded as the partially sulfated galactans. The polysaccharide is extracted from the cell walls of red seaweeds [

Among the three categories of the carrageenan, kappa and iota types of carrageenan are commonly preferred as film-forming biopolymers. Since the carrageenans are hydrophilic in nature, they have been explored extensively as a film-forming agents. Polysaccharides consist of double helices, which undergo physical interactions to form a 3-D network when the carrageenan solutions are moderately dried. The 3-D network, so formed, induces the gelation of the polysaccharide matrices, which upon complete drying forms a stable film. Due to the film-forming ability of carrageenan, it has found extensive applications as edible films and coatings (

This has been reasoned to the relatively lower hydrophilicity of the kappa-carrageenan as compared to the iota-carrageenan [
