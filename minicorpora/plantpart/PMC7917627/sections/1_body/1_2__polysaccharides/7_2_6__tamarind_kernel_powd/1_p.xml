<p>Tamarind (
 <italic>Tamarindus indica</italic> Linn; family: 
 <italic>Leguminosae</italic>) seeds are the superfluous product of the tamarind-based agro and food industries. The tamarind seeds constitute ~30â€“40% of the whole fruit weight [

The TKP has evolved as a promising raw material for food processing and food packaging applications in the last decade. Since TKP is extracted from unwanted products, the synthesis of edible products leads to the valorization of the industrial wastes, which helps in reducing carbon emission. The TKP, which appears as powder, contains a significant amount of proteins and polysaccharides. Due to the presence of proteins and polysaccharides in very high amounts, the TKP can form good quality films that have shown excellent properties to be used for food packaging applications. Akin to the previously mentioned polysaccharides, TKP is also biodegradable, biocompatible, and nontoxic. Similar to TKP, tamarind starch is also extracted from tamarind seeds. Tamarind starch has also been explored for developing edible films [
