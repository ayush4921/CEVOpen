<p>Many researchers have explored the application of cashew gum, a water-soluble high molecular weight anionic polysaccharide, for food applications [
 <xref rid="B44-polymers-13-00575" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The gum is categorized as a complex heteropolysaccharide, which is extracted from the exudate from the cashew tree (
 <italic>Anacardium occidentale</italic> L.) [
 <xref rid="B45-polymers-13-00575" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Chemically, the gum majorly consists of β-d-galactopyranose, α-d-glucopyranose, α-L-arabinofuranose, α-l-rhamnopyranose, and β-d-glacturonic acid [

The polymeric architectures of cashew gum exhibit antifungal and antibacterial properties. It has been reported that due to its inherent antimicrobial properties, the polymeric architectures of cashew gum can help prevent food from pathogenic and spoilage bacteria [
