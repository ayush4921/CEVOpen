<p>The alginate biopolymer is extracted from brown algae and is biodegradable. Chemically, alginates are composed of (1→4)-linked-α-L-guluronate and (1→4)-linked-β-D-mannuronate moieties. The biopolymer is a linear anionic polysaccharide. The ionic nature of the alginates makes them highly soluble in water. Accordingly, they have been explored as film-forming biopolymers. The films that are made with alginates are transparent and of good quality. The films and coatings of alginates provide sufficient barrier properties to the external factors. Due to their excellent barrier properties, the alginate films and coatings hinder the permeation to oils, fats, moisture, and oxygen across it. The hindrance to the oxygen permeation prevents the oxidation of the food constituents, while the hindrance to the moisture loss prevents shrinkage of the food products [

Further, the films and coatings of alginates also provide excellent barrier properties to the microbes that help reduce the chances of microbial growth over the food materials. Additionally, the alginate-based films and coatings help to reduce the flavor, and color loss [

The use of the partially oxidized alginates combines the advantages of aldehydic crosslinking without compromising the edible nature of the films, which is not the case for the synthetic aldehydes such as glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde, and glyceraldehyde [
