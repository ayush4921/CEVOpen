<p>Many of the cellulose derivatives are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (US-FDA) for food and pharmaceutical applications. In general, the cellulose derivatives are good film-forming agents, which is promoted by their hydrophilic nature. Hence, they have been explored extensively as edible films and coatings. They are inherently biocompatible (nontoxic), biodegradable, and nonimmunogenic in nature, which makes them suitable for human use/ consumption. Apart from the film-forming agents, cellulose derivatives are also used as emulsifiers, protective colloids, adhesives, and thickeners [

The CMC is synthesized by the carboxymethylation of the cellulose backbone. Films formed of CMC are transparent and exhibit excellent mechanical properties, which are exceptionally beneficial (

 <xref rid="B15-polymers-13-00575" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Unfortunately, the films based on CMC alone have found limited application as edible films and coatings. This has been reasoned to the poor moisture barrier properties of the CMC-only films [
 <xref rid="B16-polymers-13-00575" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This has necessitated the development of CMC films in conjunction with other biopolymers. The films synthesized with the blends of CMC and other biopolymers (e.g., chitosan, starch, and collagen) were found to improve the shortcomings presented by the CMC-only films. Similar to CMC, cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP) is also a semisynthetic biopolymer that has greatly been explored in pharmaceutical industries as coating materials for enteric-coated tablets and capsules. The polymer is a crystalline polymer. Akin to CMC, CAP is also hydrophilic and biodegradable. The polymer was recently explored in conjunction with chitosan to develop nano-zinc oxide reinforced food packaging films [
