<p>The soluble soybean polysaccharide (SSPS) is an anionic polyelectrolyte and has a chemical structure that resembles pectin chemistry [
 <xref rid="B29-polymers-13-00575" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The biopolymer is extracted from the soy cotyledons [
 <xref rid="B30-polymers-13-00575" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and is usually a byproduct of the soy protein production industry [
 <xref rid="B29-polymers-13-00575" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Chemically, an SSPS has a galacturonan backbone. The galacturonan backbone is composed of short-chain homogalacturonan and long-chain rhamnogalacturonan. Several branches within the galacturonan backbone consist of sugar chains of β-1,4-galactan and α-1,3 or α-1,5- arabinan chains [

 <xref rid="B31-polymers-13-00575" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The biopolymer is highly soluble in water, biodegradable, and biocompatible in nature. It also possesses viscosity building and antioxidant properties [
 <xref rid="B29-polymers-13-00575" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Further, these biopolymers have been explored as emulsifiers and film-forming agents in food research (

 <xref rid="B31-polymers-13-00575" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The properties of the SSPS films have been tailored using plasticizers and essential oils [
 <xref rid="B31-polymers-13-00575" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Studies on tailoring the properties of SSPS films by nanoparticle reinforcement have also been conducted by many researchers [
