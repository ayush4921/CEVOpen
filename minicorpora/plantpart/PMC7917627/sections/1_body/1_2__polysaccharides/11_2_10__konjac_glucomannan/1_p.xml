 <xref rid="B38-polymers-13-00575" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The polysaccharide is mainly composed of D-mannose and d-glucose monomers. The monomeric units are linked together by β-1,4-linking while the side chain is linked by β-1,6-glycosyl linking [

 <xref rid="B38-polymers-13-00575" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Akin to the other plant-derived polysaccharides, KG is a nontoxic, biodegradable, and viscosity modulator. It has been regarded as GRAS material by the US-FDA [
 <xref rid="B38-polymers-13-00575" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. It also has an excellent film-forming property, which has been explored by food scientists to design edible films for food packaging applications. Unfortunately, KGM-only films suffer from poor mechanical and moisture barrier properties [
