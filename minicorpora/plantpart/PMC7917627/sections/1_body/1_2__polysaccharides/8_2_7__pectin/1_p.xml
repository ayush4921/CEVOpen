<p>Pectin is a heteropolysaccharide and is extracted from plants and fruits. The biopolymer is the major constituent of all the plants and is responsible for the significant mass in the plants [

 <xref rid="B27-polymers-13-00575" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. It has emerged as a prominent biopolymer for food and biomedical applications due to its inherent biocompatible nature. The biopolymer is majorly constituted of linear homogalacturonans (smooth region), rhamnogalacturonan-II, and highly branched rhamnogalacturonan-I regions [
 <xref rid="B27-polymers-13-00575" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The homogalacturonans are present in the highest amount. The homogalacturonans are connected by α-D-galacturonic acid (GalA) by means of the 1→4 glyosidic bonds [

The extent of methylation can alter the properties of the pectins significantly. Based on the extent of methylation, pectins are categorized either as high methoxyl pectin (degree of methylation &gt;50%) and low methoxyl pectin (degree of methylation &lt; 50%) [
 <xref rid="B27-polymers-13-00575" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The structuring properties of the pectins are dependent on the extent of methylation. The structuring properties of the pectins have been well explored to tune the physical properties of the food products. The tuning of the physical properties is achieved by mixing pectins with different degrees of methylation. The edible films and coatings of pectins have good mechanical properties. Further, the mechanical properties of pectin-based edible films and coatings can be tailored by blending with proteins and polysaccharides (
