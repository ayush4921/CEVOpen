<p>The mushroom polysaccharides are extracted from the fruiting bodies, sclerotia, and mycelium of oyster mushroom (
 <italic>Pleurotus ostreatus</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B34-polymers-13-00575" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The said mushroom is the most commonly consumed mushroom across the globe, and consists of a quantum of insoluble edible fiber [
 <xref rid="B35-polymers-13-00575" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The polysaccharide is synthesized as a metabolite by the oyster mushroom [
 <xref rid="B34-polymers-13-00575" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The polysaccharide mainly consists of Î²-glucan polymer units, which are linked to monosaccharide units through glycosidic linkages [
 <xref rid="B36-polymers-13-00575" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The polysaccharides have excellent nutritional properties. The polysaccharides have several beneficial biological properties, namely, antiaging, immunomodulatory, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, etc. [
 <xref rid="B36-polymers-13-00575" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Due to the natural origin of the mushroom polysaccharides, the polysaccharides are biodegradable in nature. Hence, they have been used to develop biodegradable films for food applications (
