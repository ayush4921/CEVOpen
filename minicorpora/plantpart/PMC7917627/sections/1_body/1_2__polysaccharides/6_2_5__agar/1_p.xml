<p>Agar is a marine biopolymer which is extracted from red algae. The biopolymer is categorized as Generally Regarded As Safe (GRAS) by the US FDA. It received the GRAS status in the year 1972 [

However, the films that are formed by the agar are highly brittle and possess poor moisture barrier properties and thermal stabilities [

A significant number of studies are being carried out to overcome the aforesaid disadvantages of agar films and to make the agar-based films suitable as edible films and coatings. Some of the strategies employed to improve the quality of the agar films include nanoparticle reinforcement and making blends of agar with biopolymers.
