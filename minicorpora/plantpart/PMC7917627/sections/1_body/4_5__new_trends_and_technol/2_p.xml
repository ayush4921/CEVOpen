<p>Edible polymers are readily available in nature, and are therefore sustainable. Further, these polymers are usually biodegradable and biocompatible/nontoxic. However, a variety of polymers are available in nature. Each of these polymers has its unique beneficial properties. Some may have certain disadvantages too. For example, the films based on CMC are inherently brittle. In general, blends of edible polymers are used to develop the main matrix to achieve desirable properties for packaging applications, which differs for different types of food products. Hence, the major challenge for researchers is to identify a suitable combination of edible polymers and/or additives such as plasticizers that can fulfill the requirements for the packaging of the food products. Further, most of the techniques to develop such products employ wet methods, which makes the upscaling of these products by the industries quite cumbersome. It is expected that in the near future researchers will be able to overcome these challenges to develop suitable technologies that can help industries to upscale the synthesis of edible films and coatings of food products.</p>
