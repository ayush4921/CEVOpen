<p>Currently, there is a considerable challenge to researchers to develop products with good customer acceptability. The sale of food products is now greatly regulated by consumer demands. Herein, the packaging of food products plays an important role. Unlike in the recent past, the packaging materials are expected to be of high quality. The industries are looking towards the use of sustainable natural materials such as proteins, polysaccharides, and essential oils to design safer food packages. The uses of nonbiodegradable and nonrenewable petroleum-based polymers are nowadays out of favor to design food packages. This has been attributed to the harmful environmental effects exerted by these polymers. The use of sustainable natural materials allows the researchers to design films and coatings which are edible unlike the packages made from petroleum-based polymers that are nonedible. The edible films and coatings are safe for human consumption. These films and coatings can not only help in extending the shelf-life of the food products by controlling the respiration/moisture evaporation process, but also help in preventing the growth of the pathogenic microbes. Currently, many of the edible films and coatings are as efficient as those of the modified-atmosphere packages.</p>
