<p>In the last decade, there has been an increased interest in the development of polysaccharide-based edible films and coatings for the protection of food products. These have been ascribed to the availability of the polysaccharides in nature, and hence are available at a low cost. Additionally, the polysaccharides are inherently biocompatible and biodegradable. These properties allow for the use of polysaccharides as edible films and coatings. The polysaccharide-based systems have shown great promise in extending the shelf-life of food products, which can be ascribed to the barrier effects exerted by such systems. Such systems have been used for the protection of a variety of food products that include vegetables, fruits, meat and meat products, seafood, and confectionery products. Their ability to extend shelf-life is mainly associated with their ability to prevent dehydration, rancidity due to oxidation, and enzymatic browning. Due to the barrier properties exerted by the edible films and coatings of polysaccharides, it is possible to control the internal atmosphere between the polysaccharide layer and the food products. The inclusion of the EOs within the polysaccharide matrices increases not only their antimicrobial activities, but also the antioxidant properties. The polysaccharide matrix has been found to tailor the release of the EOs, thereby sustaining the release of the EOs and the shelf-life of the food products. With the advancement in the field of polymer technology, it is expected that the quality of the polysaccharide-based edible films and coatings can be improved significantly in the years to come. </p>
