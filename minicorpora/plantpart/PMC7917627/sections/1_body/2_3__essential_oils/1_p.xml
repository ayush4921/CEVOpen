<p>The composition of the EOs is very complex. A typical EO would constitute more than 300 types of components. The EOs consist of 85–99% of volatile compounds [
 <xref rid="B43-polymers-13-00575" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The amount of each component is specific for the EO from a particular plant source. Further, the chemical constituent for a specific plant source can also vary depending on the geographical location of the collection. The alterations in the environmental conditions also affect the composition of the secondary metabolites. In essence, the composition of the EOs, in general, varies significantly. In general, the EOs consist of a variety of volatile chemicals that include terpenes, alcohols, ketones, phenols, aldehydes, amines, and amides [
 <xref rid="B47-polymers-13-00575" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. These volatile compounds are low molecular weight components. Usually, the molecular weight of such components is approximately 300 Da. However, some of these components may have molecular weights of up to 1000 Da. Majorly, the bioactive components of the EOs are categorized as terpenes/terpenoids and aromatic/aliphatic compounds (
 <xref rid="polymers-13-00575-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The quantum of terpenes/terpenoids in EOs is higher than the aromatic/aliphatic compounds. Some of the common terpenes/terpenoids include citronellol, geraniol, limonene, terpeniol, carvone, carvacrol, thymols, linalool, cineole, and camphor. These components usually form the major constituent of the EOs. Many EOs are constituted with 20–70% of the aforesaid components, which have been reasoned for most of the EO-associated biological activities [
 <xref rid="B47-polymers-13-00575" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The low molecular weight terpenes and terpenoids are the primary constituents responsible for the antimicrobial activity of the EOs. The composition of the EOs is analyzed mainly by chromatographic techniques such as gas chromatography, and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography [
