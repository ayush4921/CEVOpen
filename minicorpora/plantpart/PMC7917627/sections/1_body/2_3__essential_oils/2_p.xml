<p>The EOs appear as colorless liquids. As mentioned earlier, these liquids are highly volatile, which can be ascribed to their aromatic natures. These volatile liquids are the secondary metabolites produced by the plants and hence are present in most parts of the plantsâ€”namely, seeds, flowers, peel, stem, bark, and whole plants [

This can be explained by the antimicrobial activity of the EOs. The antimicrobial activity of the EO was first reported De la Croix during the year 1881. The study reported the antimicrobial activity of the EO vapor. Thereafter, the EOs from different sources have been tested for different biological activities. The majority of the EOs from different sources have been reported to possess a wide range of biological activities that include antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, and insecticidal activities [
