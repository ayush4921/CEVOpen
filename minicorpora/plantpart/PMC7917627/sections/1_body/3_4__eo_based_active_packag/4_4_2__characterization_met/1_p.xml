<p>The interactions between the EOs and the polymers play an important role in not only governing the properties of the EO-APs, but also in the shelf-life and the quality of the food products. The nature of the migration of the EOs within the polymer matrices can govern the shelf-life of the food products. The physical properties of the EO-Aps, such as the microbial, gas exchange, and moisture barriers, are significantly governed by the nature of the interactions between the EOs and the polymer matrix. Further, the mechanical and the viscoelastic properties of the films are also dependent on the EOâ€“polymer matrix interactions. An alteration in the EO content can result in a variation in the thickness and other aforesaid properties. The colors of the edible films and coatings vary with the nature and composition of the EO-AP composite system. Hence, in this section, we will discuss the different types of characterization techniques that are used for the analysis of the EO-APs.</p>
