<p>The EOs generally exhibit antimicrobial activities due to the factors mentioned above. The inclusion of the EOs within the films was intentionally carried out to exploit the antimicrobial efficacy of the EOs. The edible films and coatings were expected to release EOs over the food products in a sustained manner such that the films and the coatings can hinder the process of microbial growth. The antimicrobial activities of the EO-APs is generally checked by disc diffusion assay [

 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic>, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, etc.) were spread over the culture plates of sterilized solidified media (e.g., nutrient agar, BHI agar media). Thereafter, films cut into circular pieces were placed over the solidified media. Then, the culture plates were incubated to allow the growth of the microbes. The antimicrobial activities of the films were analyzed by measuring the zone of inhibition around the pieces of the films. The antimicrobial activity of the films was dependent on the composition of the films. The edible coatings on food products were peeled off and then tested for antimicrobial activity in a similar manner to that mentioned for films. The nature of the biopolymer matrices plays an important role in the release profile of the EOs and can significantly affect the antimicrobial activity of the EO-APs [

The incorporation of the EOs within the chitosan matrix synergistically increases the antimicrobial properties of the resultant films [
