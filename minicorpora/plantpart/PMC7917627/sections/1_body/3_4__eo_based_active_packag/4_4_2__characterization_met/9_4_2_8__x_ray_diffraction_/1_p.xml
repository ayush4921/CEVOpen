<p>The XRD analysis allows the analysis of the molecular interactions within the samples in a nondestructive manner. The analysis allowed us to estimate the d-spacing (interplanar spacing), crystallite size, and crystal defects within the samples. The polysaccharide-based films usually showed a characteristic broad peak at ~20° 2θ (

In general, an increase in the EO content can increase the d-spacing with a concurrent decrease in the crystallite size and increase in the lattice strain. Interestingly, at lower concentrations of EO, a decrease in the d-spacing and lattice strain, and an increase in the crystallite strain was also observed [
