<p>The water solubility of the EO-APs is an important measure for the packaging materials, especially for the packaging materials that are meant to be in contact with high-moisture food products. It is expected that the packaging materials should withhold their integrity even in high-moisture environments. The hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of the films can significantly alter the water solubility of the films. The water solubility of the EO-APs can be determined by putting an accurately weighed piece of the EO-APs into the deionized water, kept on agitation. The use of deionized water is preferred as the presence of ions in the water may alter the solubilization process. Further, the agitation of the water is recommended during the solubilization process. The agitation helps to prevent the formation of the saturation layer around the films that may hinder the solubilization process of the films. The addition of EOs is reported to increase the lipophilicity of the EO-AP films. It has been observed that, due to this reason, the addition of EOs lowers the water solubility of the EO-AP films as compared to the pristine polymeric films [
