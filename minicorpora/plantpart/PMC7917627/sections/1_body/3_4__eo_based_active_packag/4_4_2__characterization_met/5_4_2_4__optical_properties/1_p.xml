<p>The visual appearance of the packaging material plays an important role in consumer acceptability. Hence, the optical properties of the packaging materials were analyzed in-depth by measuring the color parameters of the films. The colorimetric analysis of the films was carried out in the reflection mode for the opaque films, and in the transmittance mode for the films that contain a certain degree of transmittance [

The CIELAB color space was defined by the International Commission on Illumination in the year 1976. It measures the color parameters in terms of L*, a*, and b*. The CIELAB color space has been depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-00575-f016">Figure 16</xref>. The L* value is regarded as the lightness of the samples, and it varies from 0 to 100. Herein, 0 stands for black, and 100 stands for white. The a* value represents the variation in color that may vary from green to red. The greenish colors are represented as –ve a* values, while the reddish colors are represented as +ve a* values. Lastly, the b* values represent the variation in the color that may vary from blue to yellow. The blueish colors have –ve b* values, while the yellowish colors have +ve b* values. The combination of a* and b* values results in the generation of the hue, which is associated with the true color of the samples. The color parameters of the films are dependent on the color of the raw materials. The lightness and the whiteness index of the polymeric films increases as EOs are incorporated within the polymeric matrices. This has been ascribed to the dispersion of the light from the interface of the polymer–EO interface [
