<p>The analysis of the mechanical properties of the edible films and coatings provides information on the probable durability of the films. Additionally, the mechanical properties can divulge the ability of the films and coatings to protect the food products from production to consumption. Various mechanical properties such as tensile strength, Young’s modulus, and percentage stress relaxation were determined to compute the efficacy of the edible films and coatings [

 <xref rid="B108-polymers-13-00575" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. These properties were related to the microstructure of the films and coatings, and hydrogen bonding within the components of the films and coatings. The tensile strength at the breakpoint and Young’s modulus are determined by analyzing the films in the tensile mode. The film samples were extended at a speed slower than 1 mm/s. Some authors employed a higher speed of extension. However, a higher speed of extension is often discouraged. This is because, at higher speeds, the impact of stress can affect the outcome of the result. The tensile strength at the breakpoint of the biopolymeric films is generally in the range of 20–30 MPa (

 <xref rid="B109-polymers-13-00575" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. The addition of the EOs within the biopolymeric matrices results in the disruption of the network structure, which can reduce the tensile strength to as low as 10 MPa [

 <xref rid="B96-polymers-13-00575" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. The wide variation in the tensile strength properties of the EO-containing films can be ascribed to the multifactorial variations including EO droplet size and distribution, the nature of the biopolymer(s) used, and the interaction between the EO and the biopolymer(s). The Young’s moduli of the films is related to its stiffness/rigidity. Inclusion of the EOs within the biopolymeric matrices usually reduces the Young’s moduli of the films. This is ascribed to the injunction of the structural deformity within the biopolymeric matrices, which consequently reduces the fracture strength of the films [
 <xref rid="B111-polymers-13-00575" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. The stress relaxation studies provide a measure of the viscoelastic properties of the biopolymeric films. This study was also carried out in the extension mode. The inclusion of the EOs within the biopolymeric matrices has been reported to increase the fluidic nature of the films with a consequent decrease in the stored energy at the end of the relaxation process [
