<p>The analysis of the microstructure of the films may divulge interesting information on the properties of the films. Hence, the microstructure of the EO-AP was analyzed. The use of a suitable microscopic technique may allow researchers to identify the arrangement of the different phases of the films [
 <xref rid="B99-polymers-13-00575" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. The arrangement of the different phases has been reported to alter not only the optical properties but also the mechanical and barrier properties of the EO-AP films [
 <xref rid="B24-polymers-13-00575" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The microstructural arrangements within the films are dependent on the interfacial properties among the different phases. This, in turn, tailors the dispersion characteristics and the EO droplet morphology within the biopolymeric films [
 <xref rid="B100-polymers-13-00575" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. The process parameters employed during the preparation of the films can also alter the film characteristics. This is because the use of suitable process parameters can prevent emulsion destabilization (i.e., flocculation, coalescence, and creaming of the EO phase) during the evaporation phase of the film formation [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-00575-f018">Figure 18</xref>), and confocal microscopy (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-00575-f019">Figure 19</xref>). The biopolymeric films are relatively smooth. Incorporation of the EOs within the biopolymeric matrices increases their roughness significantly. In general, an increase in the EO content increases the roughness that results in the formation of a heterogenous surface structure [
 <xref rid="B24-polymers-13-00575" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The distribution of the EOs within the biopolymeric matrices can be analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The analysis technique involves the solubilization of a chromophore (e.g., Fluorol Yellow 088). The distribution of the chromophore within the biopolymeric matrices is then visualized by CLSM [
