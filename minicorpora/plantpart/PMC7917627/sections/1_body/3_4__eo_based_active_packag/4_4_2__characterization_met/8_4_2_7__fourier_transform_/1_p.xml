<p>FTIR analysis of the films was generally carried out in attenuated total reflectance (ATR) mode. ATR-FTIR analysis is a nondestructive way to analyze the film samples. For the analysis, the films were placed in contact with the ATR crystal, which is made up of either diamond in a high-valued instrument and zinc selenide in cheaper spectroscopes. It was ensured that the films form firm contacts with the ATR crystal. Biopolymeric films usually show an absorption peak of the hydroxyl group stretching at a wavenumber of ~3350 cm

 <sup>−1</sup>. Agarwal et al. (2020) have reported that the addition of geraniol results in a significant alteration in the broad peak which is present in the wavenumber region of 3700−2900 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. The authors concluded that the addition of EOs alters the hydrogen bonding within the biopolymeric matrices. It was observed that at the lowest geraniol content, the hydrogen bonding was increased. However, an increase in the geraniol content monotonously reduced the hydrogen bonding [
