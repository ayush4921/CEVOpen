<p>The determination of the moisture content within the polymeric films was carried out by the thermogravimetric analysis method. Simplistically, the films were incubated in a hot air oven that is maintained at 105–110 °C. The incubation of the films was continued until a constant weight of the films was obtained [
 <xref rid="B95-polymers-13-00575" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. The weight of the polymeric films was recorded before and after the incubation. Herein, the films were heated by the process of convection. The moisture content (MC) within the films was calculated using Equation (1) [
