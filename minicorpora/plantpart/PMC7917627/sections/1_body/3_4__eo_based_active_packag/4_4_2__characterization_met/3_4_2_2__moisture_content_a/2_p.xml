<p>Recently, the MC analysis of the films has been carried out using moisture analyzers. Moisture analyzers automate the process mentioned above. The thermogravimetric moisture analyzers consist of an infrared radiation source (mostly halogen lamps), which radiates infrared radiation and consequently increases the temperature within the moisture analysis chamber. The infrared radiations are absorbed by the samples, thereby increasing the sample temperature. The chamber is fitted with a weighing balance. The weighing balance helps to continuously monitor the change in the weight of the samples. The processor of the instrument displays the change in the weight of the samples in grams/milligrams or percentage moisture loss. The main advantage of the moisture analyzers is that the measurement can be carried out mostly within 5â€“15 min. It is reported that the addition of EOs reduces the moisture content of the films. This has been attributed to the reduction in the hydrophilicity of the films with the incorporation of the EOs, which in turn affects the interaction of the water molecules with the polymer chains [

However, the determination of the moisture content of the EO-APs by the thermogravimetric method, both manual and automated, is quite debatable. This is because the EOs are volatile in nature and they also tend to evaporate within the experimental conditions.
