<p>The physical (e.g., barrier, water vapor transmission rate, moisture content, etc.) and mechanical properties of the films are influenced by the thicknesses of the films. Hence, the thickness of the EO-APs is generally measured. The measurement of the films is usually measured using a micrometer. The use of a micrometer having a least count of at least 0.001 mm has been proposed by the researchers [

It has been observed that the addition of EOs within the polymer matrices increases the thickness of the EO-AP films—e.g., the addition of geraniol increased the thickness of the tamarind kernel powder/geraniol films from 0.240 ± 0.03 (0.5%
