<p>The transmission of water vapor molecules plays an important role in food packaging and coatings. The food packaging and coatings are expected to retain moisture within the food products by retarding the loss of moisture across the developed films. The films that can retard the moisture migration to the external environment have been found to increase the shelf-life of the food products [

 <xref rid="B105-polymers-13-00575" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. The WVTR of the films was estimated by gravimetric analysis. The films were used to seal the glass vials that contain water. The vials were then transferred to a thermal cabinet that was maintained at 25 °C and 45% RH. The vials were initially allowed to equilibrate for 1 h. Thereafter, the weights of the vials were recorded for a particular duration at regular intervals. Then, the loss of the moisture was then plotted against time. The WVTR values in g/h·m
 <sup>2</sup> were then estimated from the plot [
