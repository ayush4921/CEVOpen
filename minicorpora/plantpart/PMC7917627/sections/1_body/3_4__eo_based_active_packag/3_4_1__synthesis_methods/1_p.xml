<p>The EO-APs are commonly developed by solution casting method. Initially, the film forming solutions (FFSs) are prepared by dissolving the polysaccharides (1â€“5

 <italic>v</italic>%) in a suitable solvent such as deionized water, ethanol etc. The dissolution process may require stirring and heating to facilitate the dissolution of the polysaccharides. EOs are then generally incorporated in the FFS, and subsequently homogenized either by high-speed blenders or ultrasonication so as to form EO-in-polysaccharide solution emulsions, which are known as film-forming emulsions (FFEs). Placticizers (e.g., glycerol, polyethylene glycol) are often added to FFEs. The addition of the plasticizers helps to improve the flexibility to the films. The FFEs are then poured into molds, kept on a levelled surface, and then dried either at room or elevated temperature (

Hence, artificial surfactants (e.g., Tween 20, Tween 80, Lecithin, etc.) are normally utilized to prepare the emulsions of EOs. In recent years, edible proteins and polysaccharides have been explored to prepare pickering emulsions. Pickering emulsions ensure sustained release of the EOs. In this regard, zein protein (an FDA approved material for food applications) particles have been used to stabilize pickering emulsions [

The thickness of the films is controlled herein by adjusting the scraper height. The drying of the films is achieved within the drying chamber of the casting unit. Multilayered films can also be prepared by running multiple casting cycles. For the purpose, the FFEs are added over the previously casted layers (
