<p>Alternatively, the FFEs are allowed to form a polymeric coating on the food product itself. This is performed by dipping the food products within the FFEs and drying them under controlled environmental conditions. The properties of these films can be further improved by physical or chemical crosslinking [

The coating of the films can also be achieved by the spraying technique, in which the food products are sprayed with the FFEs through a nozzle. The spraying is generally carried out inside a reactor or an enclosure where the environment temperature is precisely controlled. During the process, the food products are rotated to ensure uniform coating [
