<p>As mentioned above, EOs are excellent antimicrobial agents and can be consumed orally without any untoward effects. Many of the EOs have been regarded as GRAS materials by the US-FDA. However, the EOs are volatile liquids, which makes them unsuitable for developing antimicrobial packaging systems. The EO-containing packaging (EO-AP) system consists of a polymeric film that houses EOs within the polymeric architecture. The polymeric films consist of several micropores. The micropores allow the migration of the EOs from the matrix phase to the surface of the films (

In other words, EO-AP systems act as reservoir systems, and the EOs are released from the systems by the process of diffusion. It is important to note that if the EOs are miscible with the food materials, an unconstrained free diffusion of the EOs takes place within the matrix. This results in a decrease in the EO levels within the EO-AP systems as time progresses. After a certain period, the EO levels fall significantly, thereby resulting in an insufficient amount of EOs being released to the surface, which is lower than the minimum inhibitory concentration of the EOs. At this juncture, the EO-AP system fails to protect the food materials. On the contrary, in the case of EOs not being miscible with the food materials, the EO-AP systems act as monolithic systems from where a unilateral diffusion of EOs takes place. Herein, the EO content within the EO-AP systems essentially remains the same throughout the shelf-life of the food products. This results in the maintenance of the EO levels over the food surface at a predefined concentration. A mechanistic approach of the EO diffusion for both cases has been provided in

 <xref rid="B5-polymers-13-00575" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. As the concentration of the EOs over the food product surface is an important criterion that governs the shelf-life of the food products, the development of the EO-AP system with a suitable release profile is a must. Such a system is expected to allow the diffusion of the EOs in a controlled manner. In other words, the EO-AP system should act as a controlled delivery system for the EOs. The analysis of the kinetics of the diffusion of the EOs from the EO-AP system is an essential criterion. At any given point in time, the amount of EOs over the food surface should be more than the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the pathogens. Hence, the rate of diffusion of the EOs can affect the shelf-life of the food products. In general, an EO with a higher diffusion rate will quickly fall below the MIC levels, which would result in shorter shelf-lives of the food products. On the contrary, a sustained diffusion of EOs can significantly extend the shelf-life of the food products [
 <xref rid="B5-polymers-13-00575" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, it has to be kept in mind that if the diffusion of EOs is too slow from the EO-AP system, this may result in a lower concentration of the EOs over the food surface. In this case, the EO-AP system will not be able to protect the foods at all.
