<p>Further, it is important to note that apart from understanding the diffusion mechanics of the EO-AP composite film matrices, the insight on the growth kinetics of the microorganisms is also needed to be understood. This is because if the rate of microbial growth is higher than the rate of release of the EOs from the EO-AP system, then the quantum of the EO released would not be sufficient to control the growth of the proliferating microbes. It would lead to the spoilage of the food products quickly. This can be explained by the fact that the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the EO for inhibiting the growth of the microbes would not be maintained. On the contrary, if the release is too fast, the EO would be consumed quickly and that would also reduce the shelf-life of the food products. In this case, the amount of EO will be much greater than the MIC during the initial phase. However, as time would progress, the EO will be depleted from the reservoirs of the EO-AP matrix systems. This would ultimately result in the availability of the EOs in levels lower than the MIC.</p>
