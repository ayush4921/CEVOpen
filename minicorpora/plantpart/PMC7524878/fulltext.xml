Mints produce essential oils, which are known to affect the growth of other plants. We used a comparative approach to identify allelopathic compounds from different Mints (genus <italic>Mentha</italic>, but also including Cat Mint, <italic>Nepeta cataria</italic>, and Corean Mint, <italic>Agastache rugosa</italic>, belonging to sisters clades within the <italic>Mentheae</italic>) using the standard cress germination assay as readout. To understand the mechanism behind this allelopathic effect, we investigated the response of tobacco BY-2 cell lines, expressing GFP-tagged markers for microtubules and actin filaments to these essential oils. Based on the comparison between bioactivity and chemical components, we identified menthone as prime candidate for the allelopathic effect, and confirmed this bioactivity targeted to microtubules experimentally in both, plant cells (tobaccoBY-2), and seedlings (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>). We could show that menthone disrupted microtubules and induced mortality linked with a rapid permeabilization (less than 15&#x000a0;min) of the plasma membrane. This mortality was elevated in a tubulin marker line, where microtubules are mildly stabilized. Our study paves the way for the development of novel bioherbicides that would be environmentally friendly.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>microtubules</kwd><kwd>monoterpenes</kwd><kwd>allelopathy</kwd><kwd>menthone</kwd><kwd>mint</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="3"/><equation-count count="1"/><ref-count count="74"/><page-count count="16"/><word-count count="9738"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Plants have developed mechanisms to defend and adapt themselves against biotic and abiotic stress factors. As part of this defense, plants can suppress the growth of competing neighbors by releasing chemicals, a process called allelopathy (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Lambers et al., 2008</xref>). Allelochemicals can be produced in different organs and can suppress the growth of target plants by different mechanisms upon contact of the allelochemicals with the target plants (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Choesin and Boerner, 1991</xref>). Plant essential oils, often with monoterpenes as primary components, accumulate in different vegetative organs, such as leaves, bark, wood, roots, but also in flowers or fruits, sometimes in specialized glands, sometimes in lysogenic or schizogenic oil ducts (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Bruneton, 1995</xref>). In order to exert their effect, they have to be released into the environment, which is the reason, why many allelochemicals are volatiles. This leads to an interesting question that has been rarely addressed: how does the source plant prevent that it is not inhibited by its own allelochemicals? One possibility to obtain specificity would be to use compounds that activate a signaling process in the receiving plant that is not activated in the donor plant itself, due to inactivated binding of the compound.</p><p>Since allelopathy is specific, it offers interesting applications for biological pest control. In fact, plants producing essential oils have been used extensively for growth regulation, herbicidal, insecticidal, or other agricultural applications (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Bajalan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Cheng and Cheng, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Skrzypek et al., 2015</xref>). Biocontrol by essential oils has a long history&#x02014;for instance, these oils were the first food preservatives used by humans (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Thompson, 1989</xref>), and often already the crude extracts have been found to exert efficient antifungal, antimicrobial, cytostatic, and insecticidal activities (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Sivropoulou et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Mkaddem et al 2008</xref>). In some cases, the bioactivity has already been broken down to individual compounds. For instance, oil from <italic>Artemisia scoparia</italic> can inhibit germination and seedling growth of three weeds, and this allelopathic effect could be attributed to its major constituent, &#x003b2;-myrcene (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Singh et al., 2009</xref>). Components from <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> essential oil, such as eucalyptol, &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-pinene, camphene and camphor were reported to inhibit cell proliferation in roots by interfering with DNA synthesis in organelles and nucleus of the <italic>Brassica campestris</italic> root meristem (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Nishida et al., 2005</xref>). Monoterpenes (camphor and menthol) have been found to affect stomatal opening through cytoskeletal changes as a response to the monoterpenes and have effects on the growth of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> seedlings (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Kriegs et al., 2010</xref>). Similarly, citral was found to be a strong inhibitor of seed germination in <italic>Triticum sativum</italic>, <italic>Amaranthus palmeri</italic> and <italic>Brassica nigra</italic> (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Dudai et al., 1999</xref>). However, in many cases, it has remained unclear which compound or which mixture of compounds is responsible for the alellopathic effect of a given essential oil, such that the mechanisms behind the specificity of allelopathy have remained fairly elusive.</p><p>One strategy to address the specificity of bioactive compounds is to compare related species that differ in their allelopathic effect. So called aromatic plants represent an interesting target, and are known to emit volatile growth inhibitors (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Muller and Muller, 1964</xref>; <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Weir et al., 2004</xref>). Among the aromatic plants, the Lamiaceae are of particular interest, because this family which typically produces a broad repertory of terpenoids and phenolic compounds (<xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">Wink, 2003</xref>) is extremely diverse with estimated 7,000 species that often differ in their chemical characteristics, and are grouped into several hundreds of genera (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Harley et al., 2004</xref>). The pronounced chemical diversity in this group indicates that chemical signaling directed to other organisms might have been an important driving force in speciation, such that there is a good chance to identify specific allelochemicals.</p><p>Within the Lamiaceae, the Mints (<italic>Mentha</italic>) are of economical relevance, and have a long history of human use as aromatic and medical compounds. This genus comprises around 30 species of aromatic perennial herbs, distributed mostly in temperate and sub-temperate regions of Eurasia, Australia, Africa, and North America (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Dorman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Kanatt et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Hui et al., 2010</xref>). Recently, the chemical diversity of this genus has been made accessible by genomics defining a repertory of metabolic genes that have contributed to the different chemotypes (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Mint Evolutionary Genomics Consortium, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Commercial use is concentrated around Peppermint (<italic>M. x piperita</italic>), Spearmint (<italic>M. spicata</italic>), and Corn Mint (<italic>M. canadensis</italic>). While for the first two species, often leaf material is used, for instance as herbal tea, corn mint is exclusively cultivated for oil production (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Small, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Oudhia, 2003</xref>). The main compounds of <italic>Mentha</italic> essential oils are monoterpenes like limonene, menthone, and menthol, which are synthesized in glandular trichomes on the leaf surface (<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Turner et al., 2000</xref>). Although coming from closely related species, the essential oils from the different Mints show characteristic differences in composition: While the economically dominating essential oil from Peppermint (<italic>M. x piperita</italic>) contains menthol and menthone as main components (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Gul, 1994</xref>), Corn Mint (<italic>M. canadensis</italic>) is interesting as the richest source of natural menthol (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Sharma and Tyagi, 1991</xref>; <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Shasany et al., 2000</xref>), while Spearmint (<italic>M. spicata</italic>) is rich in carvone and therefore widely used as spice in several countries (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Kokkini et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>The differences of oil composition in these closely related species are linked with different bioactivities that are often of medical interest: The oil of Spearmint (<italic>M. spicata</italic>) is a natural antioxidant (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Kanatt et al., 2007</xref>), while an extract from Korean Mint (<italic>Agastache rugosa</italic>), another member of the Lamiaceae family, inhibits HIV integrase, a protein responsible for integrating the viral DNA into the human genome, and therefore being relevant as a possible target for selective antiviral therapy (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 1999</xref>). Likewise, essential oils extracted from the mint species <italic>M. pulegium</italic> and <italic>M. spicata</italic>, containing mainly pulegone, menthone, and carvone, showed strong insecticide activity on <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, whereby the oil of <italic>M. spicata</italic> was, in addition, mutagenic. Here, pulegone was found to responsible for the activity as insecticide, while the genotoxic activity could be attributed to menthone. Interestingly, the strong toxicity of pulegone was suppressed in the presence of menthone, demonstrating that synergistic or antagonistic interactions between compounds of a given oil are relevant for bioactivity (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Franzios et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>The inhibition of root growth (as well as the genotoxicity) indicates that menthone targets to microtubules. In fact, microtubules are known to be affected by important herbicide classes, such as the dinitroaniline herbicides (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Anthony et al., 1998</xref>). Disassembly of mitotic microtubules, by either anti-microtubule drugs or mutations, disrupts mitotic activity, culminating in asymmetries of newly formed cell plates (<xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">Yoneda et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Kawamura et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Vaughn, 2006</xref>). Likewise, disassembly of cortical microtubules interferes with the ordered deposition of cellulose microfibrils, such that cell elongation is blocked. Actually, it was the loss of expansion axiality after treatment with colchicine that brought Paul Green to predict the existence of &#x0201c;microtubules&#x0201d; (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Green, 1962</xref>), and, one year later, led to the discovery of &#x0201c;microtubules&#x0201d; by <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Ledbetter and Porter (1963)</xref>. Disruption of plant microtubules by monoterpenes has already been shown for citral, which can inhibit the expansion growth of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> roots by affecting cortical microtubules (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Chaimovitsh et al., 2010</xref>), and also impair the proliferation of tobacco BY-2 cells, accompanied by a high frequency of asymmetric cell walls (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Chaimovitsh et al., 2012</xref>). Taxol, a compound which is stabilizing microtubules, was able to protect BY-2 cells from this citral-mediated microtubule disruption, indicative of microtubules as primary targets of citral. Allelopathic effects of Mint have been described for Horse Mint (<italic>M. longifolia</italic>, wheat seedlings, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Bajalan et al., 2013</xref>) and Peppermint (<italic>M. x piperita</italic>, sunflower seedlings, <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Skrzypek et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The current study ventured to identify compounds underlying Mint allelopathy and to address their cellular mode of action. This was designed as comparative approach, where the differential bioactivity of different Mint oils was used as logical filter to identify active compounds. This work is built upon three axes: (1) to ensure the validity of our findings, the biodiversity used as input for the approach had to be authenticated, (2) based on this validated biodiversity, a candidate compound correlated with bioactivity could be identified as menthone, (3) menthone-induced elimination of microtubules could be identified as cellular mode of action underlying the allelopathic effect.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Plant Material</title><p>The plants, which were used for oil extraction, were raised at the Botanical Garden of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany, in glass houses.

For sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis, the program MEGA7 (Version 7.0.14) with the integrated tree explorer was used. The sequences were aligned using the Muscle algorithm of MEGA7. Alignments were trimmed to the first nucleotide downstream of the forward primer and the nucleotide preceding the reverse primer. With the same software, the phylogenetic relationships were inferred by using the neighbor-joining algorithm with a bootstrap value that was based on 1,000 replicates.

For each plant species, 30&#x02013;50 g of fresh leaf material were harvested, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and mildly ground to break up the oil cavities of the glandular hairs. The frozen plant particles and a stirrer bar were added to the still pot, which was then filled until the level of water reached the edge of the heating mantle. The distillation apparatus was filled with distilled water and the water cooling system was connected in a way that enables water flow in the opposite direction of the still. The oil was now distilled by heating the plant material for about two hours to 100&#x000b0;C. The volume of the extracted oil was collected in a graded burette, and the oil phase measured, and, to optimize yield, the tube was washed with a small quantity of n-hexane. Afterward the distillate was sealed in a glass vial and stored at 4&#x000b0;C till experimental use. The oil was later used for various treatments.</p></sec><sec id="s2_4"><title>GC-MS Analysis</title><p>The essential oils were analysed by GC-MS analysis at the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology Jena.

The largest scores obtained in this assay were around 1,000 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM7"><bold>Supplementary Data S1</bold></xref>). From this analysis, three candidates emerged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2"><bold>Figure 2C</bold></xref>): menthone/isomenthone (since both compounds interconvert easily by enolization, they were pooled), &#x003b2;-citral (isomeric with &#x003b1;-citral), and carvone. Citral has already been described as allelopathic compound with anti-microtubular activity (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Chaimovitsh et al., 2010</xref>), and, thus, served as a positive control for the feasibility of the approach, carvone, while being the most active compound, was mainly found in an accession of unclear identity (<italic>M. spicata</italic>, which in fact clustered with <italic>M. x piperita</italic>). We focused therefore on the third compound, menthone/isomenthone, which was most abundant in <italic>M. longifolia</italic> and in <italic>A. rugosa</italic>. The comparison of GC profiles for the oils from <italic>M. longifolia</italic> and <italic>A. rugosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2"><bold>Figure 2B</bold></xref>) show in both cases abundance of menthone and isomenthone, but also clear differences in the chemical speciation: while the overall content of menthone and isomenthone was comparable in both species (around 30% relative peak area), <italic>M. longifolia</italic> harbours menthol as main component (more than 50% relative peak area), which is barely detectable in the essential oil from <italic>A. rugosa</italic>. Instead, <italic>A. rugosa</italic> oil contains significant amounts of the menthone precursors limonene and pulegone. Based on the abundance of compounds and the high bioactivity score of menthone, we determined dose-response relationships for the inhibition caused by menthone/isomenthone, menthol as their derivative, limonene as their precursor, and linalool as chemically similar monoterpene with differing structural features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref>). In order to account for possible effects of solvents, 0.1 ppm n-hexane, and 0.1 ppm ethanol were used as solvent controls. Both had only negligible effect on the germination of seeds. A dose-dependent effect on germination was observed when 0.01, 0.1, and 1 ppm of menthone/isomenthone, menthol, linalool, and limonene were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref>). The strongest effect can be seen with menthone/isomenthone, where even a low concentration of 0.01 ppm inhibits the germination by about 70%, which rose to almost 99% at a concentration of 1 ppm. The least effects were observed for limonene, where even with a high concentration of 1 ppm the inhibition was just 20%. Menthol and linalool produced a similar pattern, where a dose-dependent gradual increase could be seen. The shape of the fitted sigmoidal curves differed. For concentrations up to 0.1 ppm, both, menthol and linalool inhibited only mildly (between 30 and 40%, as compared to 80% for menthone/isomenthone). Only at the highest concentration, 1 ppm, they reached to the level seen for menthone/isomenthone. Thus, menthone/isomenthone emerged as most promising candidate for the inhibitory effect of <italic>M. longifolia</italic>, and <italic>A. rugosa</italic> essential oils, while their structurally similar precursor limonene, as well as their structurally similar derivative menthol, was much less active.</p><fig id="f3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Dose-response relation for the germination inhibition of different monoterpene compounds specific to essential oils from Lamiaceae in the cress assay scored after 48&#x000a0;h of incubation in darkness at 27&#x000b0;C in presence three concentrations of menthone/isomenthone, menthol, linalool and limonene.

To test a potential impact of the cytoskeleton, in addition with the non-transformed BY-2 cells (WT), two cytoskeletal marker lines were tested: the actin marker line GF11, where actin is labelled by overexpression of the actin binding domain 2 of fimbrin with GFP (FABD2-GFP), and the microtubule marker line TuB6, where microtubules are labelled by overexpression of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> &#x003b2;-tubulin 6 fused to GFP (TuB6-GFP). In non-transformed BY-2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4"><bold>Figure 4B</bold></xref>, top), menthone/isomenthone induced a rapid increase of mortality, already after 15&#x000a0;min, more than 90% of the cells were dead. In contrast, limonene was mostly ineffective with only 20% mortality reached after 30&#x000a0;min, menthol exerted intermediate cytotoxity, which developed slower (at 15&#x000a0;min, only 25% of the cells were killed, while at 30&#x000a0;min, mortality had increased over 60%), and the solvent control did not produce any significant mortality. The time course was almost identical in the actin-marker line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4"><bold>Figure 4B</bold></xref>, centre). For the microtubule-marker line, the response to limonene was basically unaltered, and the response to menthone/isomenthone, which was already saturated in the non-transformed WT, was still close to saturation. A clear difference was observed for the response to menthol, however (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4"><bold>Figure 4B</bold></xref>, bottom): here, the amplitude of the response was significantly amplified by around the half to reach almost 90% mortality after 30&#x000a0;min. Since the concentration of menthone/isomenthone in the time-course experiment was close to saturation, we conducted then a dose-response study with lower concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4"><bold>Figure 4C</bold></xref>). This experiment revealed clearly that the sensitivity of the microtubule marker line was elevated, because saturation was reached at around 4-fold lower concentrations of menthone/isomenthone as compared to the wild type. Interestingly, also the actin marker line was somewhat more sensitive than the non-transformed WT, albeit not to the same extent.</p><fig id="f4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Structure-function relationship for the cytotoxicity of limonene, menthone, and menthol. <bold>(A)</bold> Structures and position of the tested compounds in the biosynthetic pathway for menthol. <bold>(B)</bold> Time course of cytotoxicity in non-transformed BY-2 cells (WT), in cells overexpressing GFP fusions with the actin-binding domain 2 of fimbrin (actin), and in cells overexpressing AtTuB6 (microtubules).

Since one of these dyes, Acridine Orange, permeates the plasma membrane, while the other dye, Ethidium Bromide, can reach the nucleus only after the plasma membrane had lost integrity, the color of the nucleus will change from green (when the plasma membranes is still tight, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2"><bold>Supplementary Figure S2E</bold></xref>) over orange to red (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2"><bold>Supplementary Figure S2F</bold></xref>), depending on the degree, to which the plasma membrane is permeabilized. The frequency distributions, constructed over the different concentrations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2"><bold>Supplementary Figure S2</bold></xref>), show clearly that menthone/isomenthone induced membrane permeability at significantly lower doses and to a significantly higher amplitude (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2"><bold>Supplementary Figure S2A</bold></xref>) as compared to limonene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2"><bold>Supplementary Figure S2B</bold></xref>), or the essential oil of <italic>A. rugosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2"><bold>Supplementary Figure S2C</bold></xref>). For menthone/isomenthone, from 0.25% (v/v) the Ethidium Bromide label had penetrated into the vast majority of cells within the incubation time of 15&#x000a0;min. The nuclei in those cells displayed a rough and irregular surface and in some cases, there were even indications of blebbing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2"><bold>Supplementary Figure S2F</bold></xref>, arrow). The fact that compounds that are closely related in terms of structure differ in cytotoxicity, and that the effects of menthone/isomenthone and menthol are enhanced in cells, where microtubules have been mildly stabilised argues for a specific activity of menthone/isomenthone. We, therefore, followed this further focussing on microtubules as potential target.</p></sec><sec id="s3_4"><title>Microtubule Disruption in BY2 Cells</title><p>We followed the response of microtubules to the essential oil of <italic>A. rugosa</italic> by spinning-disc confocal microscopy. The tested oils and pure compounds were administered such that they were not in direct contact with the cells, but had to reach their target through the gas phase. Thus, the effective concentrations were much lower than in the mortality assays described before. While the solvent control (n-hexane) did not solicit any microtubule response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5"><bold>Figures 5A, B</bold></xref>), microtubules were almost completely eliminated after 30&#x000a0;min exposure to the essential oil of <italic>A. rugosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5"><bold>Figures 5C, D</bold></xref>). Only very thin (but still relatively long) remnants of the microtubules were seen, while a diffuse fluorescence was observed in the cytoplasm, and a bright, but diffuse signal accumulated at the cross walls.

Then, microtubules were observed in pavement cells of the cotyledon epidermis, and the epidermis of the hypocotyl. Under control conditions, the microtubules in the pavement cells of the cotyledon were clearly visible and organized in parallel bundles that were oriented in different directions, usually more or less transverse to the expansion axis of the respective lobe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7"><bold>Figures 7A, E</bold></xref>).

Similar to the situation in tobacco BY-2 cells, a soluble, diffuse fluorescence was observed, which accumulated around vesicular structures that partially agglomerated, best visible in the samples treated by menthone/isomenthone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7"><bold>Figure 7F</bold></xref>). Also in the epidermis of the hypocotyl, microtubules were oriented in parallel arrays that were preferentially transverse in younger, still not fully elongated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7"><bold>Figure 7C</bold></xref>), while in older, fully elongated cells, they were seen more often in longitudinal direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7"><bold>Figure 7G</bold></xref>). Again, these microtubules were eliminated almost completely by the essential oil of <italic>A. rugosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7"><bold>Figure 7D</bold></xref>), or menthone/isomenthone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7"><bold>Figure 7H</bold></xref>).

To test, whether the effect required direct contact with the oil, or the compounds, the experiment was repeated with a set-up, where the oil, or the compounds had to pass through the gas phase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4"><bold>Supplementary Figure S4B</bold></xref>).

Based on the correlation between bioactivity and chemical composition, menthone/isomenthone was identified as a prime candidate for the allelopathic effect and then analyzed further with respect to the mode of action. We can show that menthone/isomenthone causes a rapid elimination of microtubules in both tobacco BY-2 cells and seedlings of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. This effect is specific for microtubules and not seen for actin. It is also specific with respect to structure and function of the compound and much weaker for the structurally closely related menthol. The mortality induced by menthone/isomenthone depends on tubulin abundance since it is accentuated in a BY-2 strain overexpressing a GFP-tagged tubulin as compared to non-transformed cells. The resulting mortality is preceded by permeabilization of the plasma membrane. These key findings lead to several scientific questions, but also bear on future applications. In the following, we will explore the anti-microtubular activity of menthone/isomenthone from different viewpoints: (i) What can we infer on the potential causal relationship with cytotoxicity? (ii) What can we infer on the potential functional context? (iii) What can we infer on the potential molecular mechanism? (iv)What are potentials and challenges of application?</p><sec id="s4_1"><title>Microtubules or Membrane&#x02014;What Is the Primary Target for Menthone/Isomenthone?</title><p>The rapid elimination of microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6"><bold>Figures 6E, F</bold></xref>) in response to menthone/isomenthone is accompanied by a loss of membrane integrity and cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4"><bold>Figure 4</bold></xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2"><bold>Supplementary Figure S2</bold></xref>). This allows two interpretations: the microtubule elimination could act upstream and release a cellular response leading to a unspecific permeabilization of the membrane, or, inversely, menthone/isomenthone could lead to a permeabilization of the membrane that would kill the cells and, secondarily, cause a breakdown of microtubules. There are several arguments against the second scenario: first, the biological effect is specific with respect to structure: the structurally closely related menthol is much less effective as compared to menthone/isomenthone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3"><bold>Figures 3</bold></xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4"><bold>4</bold></xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6"><bold>6</bold></xref>), although it is very efficient as membrane permeabilizer (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Wang and Meng, 2017</xref>). Along the same line, menthone/isomenthone is effective at lower dosage in BY-2 cells overexpressing the TuB6-GFP marker as compared to the non-transformed WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4"><bold>Figure 4C</bold></xref>) which speaks against unspecific membrane permeabilization as primary cause for microtubule elimination. Furthermore, under conditions, where microtubules are completely eliminated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6"><bold>Figures 6E, F</bold></xref>), actin filaments still persist (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3"><bold>Supplementary Figures 3C, D</bold></xref>), which would not be expected, when the cytoskeletal response would be the unspecific consequence of cell death. Furthermore, the response of microtubules seems to occur more swiftly than the permeabilization of the membrane: When the cells were treated with menthone/isomenthone through the gas phase, i.e. at very low effective concentrations, already at the earliest testable time point, 5&#x000a0;min after exposure to menthone/isomenthone, microtubules were significantly affected as compared to the solvent control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6"><bold>Figure 6</bold></xref>), while with direct contact at much higher concentrations, even after 15&#x000a0;min many cells still had retained a partial membrane integrity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2"><bold>Supplementary Figure 2A</bold></xref>). Similar to menthol, menthone/isomenthone can permeabilize membranes (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Lan et al., 2016</xref>), probably interacting with the polar moiety of phospholipids and ceramides, such that a physical contact with microtubules might be conceivable. However, the fact that the microtubule response was observed under conditions, where membrane permeability was retained, speaks rather for a specific binding site at the outer face of the plasma membrane that deploys a cellular response culminating in the disassembly of microtubules. This conclusion is also consistent with results of a study, where a panel of monoterpenes was tested with respect to microtubule degradation (using a transgenic&#x000a0;<italic>Arabidopsis&#x000a0;</italic>line over-expressing the GFP-tagged alpha tubulin TUA6), and the plasma membrane was assessed using the endocytosis marker FM4-64 (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Chaimovitsh et al., 2017</xref>). It was found that only&#x000a0;Limonene, out of the compounds used in the study, at low concentration was affecting the membrane as shown both by FM4-64 staining and by membrane leakage test.</p></sec><sec id="s4_2"><title>Allelopathy Needs Specificity&#x02014;Some Remarks on Methodology and Functional Context</title><p>We used a collection of different Mints as input for this study and found qualitative differences with respect to chemical profile and bioactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>), supporting the notion that allelopathic activity acts in a very specific manner. Since Mints belong to the taxonomically more challenging clades of the already challenging family of Lamiaceae, comprising estimated 7,000 species, authentication of the material used for bioactivity screening is mandatory. Moreover, Lindley&#x02019;s <italic>dictum</italic> that Lamiacean taxonomy with its excessive synonyms and ambiguities became &#x0201c;the disgrace of Botany&#x0201d; (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Lindley, 1829</xref>), although improved over the last years, still holds valid. We used the genetic barcoding marker <italic>psbA-trnH intergenic spacer</italic>, which for the Lamiaceae genus <italic>Ocimum</italic> was shown to provide better resolution than other markers (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">J&#x000fc;rges et al., 2018</xref>). While it was possible to discern <italic>Mentha</italic> from the other genera, and even several species within the genus, albeit often with low bootstrap support (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>), the two species <italic>M. x piperita</italic> and <italic>M. longifolia</italic> were not discriminated. This might be due to hybridization events that would not be detected by a marker located in the plastid genome, such as <italic>psbA-trnH intergenic spacer</italic> (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Gobert et al., 2006</xref>). This certainly represents a limitation of the otherwise powerful approach to use such organelle markers for genetic barcoding.</p><p>Even so, several cases could be detected, where accessions had been incorrectly assigned, which, if it had remained unnoticed, would have the potential to create considerable confusion, since the bioactivity differed considerable between different accessions. For instance, the wrongly assigned <italic>M. suaveolens</italic> produced low allelopathic activity, while the correctly assigned <italic>M. longifolia</italic> was very effective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2"><bold>Figure 2A</bold></xref>). Unfortunately, the detected cases of wrongly assigned accessions are not a mishap, but a general problem, as demonstrated by a systematic study estimating that around half of tropical species in public collections are mislabelled (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Goodwin et al., 2015</xref>). If biodiversity is used as input for functional studies such as the current research, this problem has to be addressed. While genetic barcoding has acquired attention as powerful strategy to authenticate (for a recent review see <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Thakur et al., 2019</xref>), any barcode is only as good as the reference plant is authentic. Unfortunately, this aspect is often neglected, when sequences collected from commercial samples are deposited in public databases without any further authentication of the material. Again, a recent systematic study has found that considerable proportions (ranging from around 25% in Asia up to 80% in Australia) of commercial herbal products were adulterated (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Ichim, 2019</xref>). This will create considerable spill-over of wrongly assigned sequence information in public databases. We have, therefore, for good reasons, used only curated sequence information, where the database entry gave some information about species identification and voucher material, and we strongly recommend that this should become common practice in any work involving genetic barcoding. Thus, the quality of genetic barcoding depends on the care, by which the respective specimen has been taxonomically identified. There is clearly a bottleneck, as accentuated in the conclusion by <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Goodwin et al. (2015)</xref>: <italic>&#x0201c;Rapidly increasing numbers of specimens in an increasing numbers of herbaria are not being revised because there are too few taxonomists.&#x0201d;</italic>. Molecular methods, as powerful as they are, do not rescue us from this bottleneck.</p><p>Putting aside these methodological considerations, the pronounced species dependency of the allelopathic effect leads to some interesting biological questions: When allelopathy is used as tool to outcompete other species (possibly even from the same genus&#x02014;some of the investigated Mints do occur sympatrically), there must be a mechanism that prevents self-inhibition of the donor. In case of a non-specific cellular activity, this would only be achieved by controlling the spread of the compound in space. While this seems to be the case for the production, contained to the excretion cavity of glandular hairs and scales, this is certainly not true once the essential oil is released. If, however, the effect of the compounds is linked to the presence of specific binding sites at the membrane of the receiver cell, the donor could protect itself by mutating or protecting this binding site and thus reducing it sensitivity. Thus, identification and functional analysis for the menthone/isomenthone binding site represents a crucial issue to&#x000a0;get deeper insight into the functional context of this allelopathic interaction.</p></sec><sec id="s4_3"><title>Ideas on the Microtubular Basis of Cytotoxicity</title><p>Even among the chemically diverse Lamiaceae, the Mints excel by their rich chemical diversity, where even accessions from the same species differ with respect to the composition of their essential oils (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Kokkini, 1991</xref>). Using this diversity as platform for an activity-guided fractionation approach, we identified menthone/isomenthone as compound with a strong inhibitory effect on seed germination, possibly responsible for the strong effect of <italic>A. rugosa</italic> essential oil. This finding is compatible with previous work, where menthone has been identified as major component in <italic>A. rugosa</italic> (<xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">Zieli&#x00144;ska et al., 2017</xref>), and was found to exert a moderate inhibition of germination in a comparative study of different monoterpenes (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Martino et al., 2010</xref>), albeit at very high concentrations and only in radish, while not effective in cress.

(2010)</xref>. The elimination of microtubules is accompanied by the increase of diffuse background signal in the cytoplasm, presumably representing non-polymerised tubulin heterodimers. This was observed both, for the essential oil of <italic>A. rugosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5"><bold>Figure 5D</bold></xref>), as for menthone/isomentone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6"><bold>Figure 6F</bold></xref>), and indicates that microtubules are not disrupted, but that the assembly or elongation of microtubules is impaired such that microtubules are eliminated due to their innate turnover. Again, this is reminiscent to the mode of action of citral: here, the association of &#x003b3;-tubulin, an essential component of microtubule nucleation was disrupted (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Chaimovitsh et al., 2012</xref>), as well as the assembly of microtubules <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Chaimovitsh et al., 2010</xref>). As discussed above, the elimination of microtubules seems to be responsible for the subsequent cell death and loss of membrane integrity. However, the mechanism linking microtubule elimination to cell death is still unknown, but the elevated sensitivity of the BY-2 strain overexpressing TuB6-GFP, as compared to the non-transformed wild type, indicates that it is the excess of non-polymerised tubulin heterodimers that triggers cell death. This would be in line with a phenomenon observed all over the eukaryotes, where overexpression of tubulins causes lethality (yeast: <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Katz et al., 1990</xref>; maize: <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Anthony and Hussey, 1998</xref>). In fact, the steady-state levels of tubulin heterodimers are regulated very tightly by both, post-translational, and transcriptional control circuits (for review see <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Breviario and Nick, 2000</xref>). We are currently pursuing the hypothesis, whether metacaspases, components of the machinery executing programmed cell death (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Gong et al., 2019</xref>) might be activated depending on their association with microtubules.</p></sec><sec id="s4_4"><title>Outlook: Potentials and Challenges of New Bioherbicides</title><p>Weeds are one major reason for yield losses&#x02014;for instance, just for India alone the damage caused by weeds is estimated to range at around 4.4 billion US$ per year (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Gharde et al., 2018</xref>). While herbicides had been a central asset for the success of the so called Green Revolution, there has been growing concern about the hazardous effects of synthetic herbicides, and the problem of herbicide resistance (for a classical review see <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Pimentel, 1996</xref>). As a result, the spectrum of lead structures for plant-protection control has been trimmed down, such that new mode of actions, and the use of compounds of natural origin have shifted into attention (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Dayan et al., 2012</xref>). Alellochemicals with their pronounced specificity and their innate function to suppress competitors represent promising candidates for the search of bioherbicides (for comprehensive reviews see <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Singh et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Macias et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Soltys et al., 2013</xref>). We have used the pronounced allelopathy of <italic>Mentha</italic> to identify menthone/isomenthone in a bio-activity-guided strategy.</p><p>Microtubules provide a promising target for several groups of herbicide including the phenyl carbamates, or the dinitroanilines, such as trifluralin or oryzalin (reviewed in <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Vaughn, 2000</xref>). This mode of action has certain drawbacks, though: tubulin is a fairly conservative molecule, and a compound interfering with plant microtubules is likely to interfere with animal microtubules as well, such that these compounds would be potentially cancerogenic or mutagenic. However, these herbicides acting against microtubules target to molecular moieties, where plant and animal tubulins differ, such as the C-terminus of &#x003b1;-tubulin targeted by phenylcarbamates (<xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Wiesler et al., 2002</xref>), or an amino-acid substitution in the N-terminal region of &#x003b1;-tubulin that allows the binding of dinitroanilines in plants, but not in animals (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Anthony et al., 1998</xref>). A second strategy to obtain plant-specific microtubule elimination would be not to target tubulin directly, but to target the signalling that culminates in microtubule elimination. Signalling in plant cells is fundamentally different, and there is plenty of room to find specific targets that do not occur in animal cells. This is the strategy, which we propose in the current work. There are still several tasks to be solved to render menthone/isomenthone or the essential oil of <italic>A. rugosa</italic> into a tool applicable as bioherbicide. One problem is the volatility&#x02014;on the one hand, this property allows for efficient spread, on the other hand, it will cause rapid decay of the pool that has been administered to the field. Here, we are currently testing different slow-release carriers under conditions that are close to agricultural application.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s5"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p>The datasets presented in this study can be found in online repositories.
