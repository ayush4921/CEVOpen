 <caption> Activity Guided Fractionation of oils extracted from different mint plants. (A) Inhibition of germination by essential oils extracted from different Lamiaceae. Inhibition (%) of cress seed germination after 48 h incubation in darkness at 27°C in presence of essential oils from differentMentha and other Lamiaceae accessions. The effect of essential oil from the two species of Lemon Myrtle is shown as a positive control. Data represent means and SE from three independent experimental series (n = 100 seedlings). (B) Representative gas chromatography profiles for the essential oils from M. longifolia and A. rugosa. (C) Heat map for relative abundance of compounds and bioactivity scores (as defined in the method part). </caption>
