  <p>Phylogenetic relationship of the accessions used in this study, inferred from the marker 
   <italic>psbA-trnH intergenic spacer</italic> by the Neighbor-Joining algorithm using 28 sequences from different species of Mentha (black boxes), along with neighboring taxa and the outgroup 
   <italic>Melissa</italic> (white boxes). Green circles represent accessions used in this study, where the declared identity was confirmed, based on sequences, red circles indicate accessions that turned out to be mis-assigned.
