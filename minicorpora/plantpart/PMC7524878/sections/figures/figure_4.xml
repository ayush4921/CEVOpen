  <p>Structure-function relationship for the cytotoxicity of limonene, menthone, and menthol. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Structures and position of the tested compounds in the biosynthetic pathway for menthol. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Time course of cytotoxicity in non-transformed BY-2 cells (WT), in cells overexpressing GFP fusions with the actin-binding domain 2 of fimbrin (actin), and in cells overexpressing AtTuB6 (microtubules). The values observed for the solvent controls with EtOH (0.2% v/v) after 30 min are represented by the dashed lines, the values observed for the solvent controls with n-hexane (0.2% v/v) after 30 min by solid lines. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> The dose response of cytotoxicity over the volume of menthone in the assay for the three cell lines, scored after 15 min. Data represent mean and standard errors from three independent experiments scoring 600 individual cells per data point.
