 <caption> Phylogenetic relationship of the accessions used in this study, inferred from the marker psbA-trnH intergenic spacer by the Neighbor-Joining algorithm using 28 sequences from different species of Mentha (black boxes), along with neighboring taxa and the outgroup Melissa (white boxes). Green circles represent accessions used in this study, where the declared identity was confirmed, based on sequences, red circles indicate accessions that turned out to be mis-assigned. </caption>
