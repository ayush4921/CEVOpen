  <p>Activity Guided Fractionation of oils extracted from different mint plants. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Inhibition of germination by essential oils extracted from different Lamiaceae. Inhibition (%) of cress seed germination after 48 h incubation in darkness at 27°C in presence of essential oils from differentMentha and other Lamiaceae accessions. The effect of essential oil from the two species of Lemon Myrtle is shown as a positive control. Data represent means and SE from three independent experimental series (n = 100 seedlings). 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Representative gas chromatography profiles for the essential oils from 
   <italic>M. longifolia</italic> and 
   <italic>A. rugosa</italic>. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Heat map for relative abundance of compounds and bioactivity scores (as defined in the method part).
