  <p>Dose-response relation for the germination inhibition of different monoterpene compounds specific to essential oils from Lamiaceae in the cress assay scored after 48 h of incubation in darkness at 27°C in presence three concentrations of menthone/isomenthone, menthol, linalool and limonene. The effect of the two solvent controls (0.1 ppm n-hexane, or 0.1 ppm ethanol) is shown by the solid line. Data represent means and SE from three independent experimental series (n = 100 seedlings).</p>
