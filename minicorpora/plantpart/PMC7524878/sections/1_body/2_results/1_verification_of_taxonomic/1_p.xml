<p>In order to authenticate the plants used in the study, we used the 
 <italic>psbA-trnH intergenic spacer</italic>, a plastidic marker. The sequences obtained from the amplified regions were aligned with their curated homologues recovered from GenBank using a BLAST search and the Taxonomy View tool. Only curated sequences from sources, where the identity of the plant had been determined, were used for reference (i.e. sequences from commercial products were excluded, since they are often of doubtful identity). Based on the aligned sequences, a phylogenetic tree was constructed and bootstrapped using the neighbor-joining algorithm (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">
  <bold>Figure 1</bold>
 </xref>). The tree clearly shows that the sequences from 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> species clustered separately from sequences obtained from the other tested genera within the Lamiaceae family (
 <italic>Agastache</italic>, 
 <italic>Nepeta</italic>, 
 <italic>Melissa</italic> that all formed well supported separate clades). This 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> clade differentiated into four subclades: 
 <italic>M. arvensis</italic> and 
 <italic>M. spicata</italic> were clearly distinct with sufficient bootstrap support (99% for both clades against the other 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> accessions, 87% for the separation between 
 <italic>M. arvensis</italic> and 
 <italic>M. spicata</italic>). Also 
 <italic>M. suaveolens</italic> differentiated into a separate clade, albeit with lower bootstrap support (65%). The largest group comprised 
 <italic>M. longifolia</italic> and 
 <italic>M.Â x piperita</italic>, without any differentiation between these two species. Our analysis also revealed that some plants had been wrongly assigned. We can clearly see that MH753577, declared as 
 <italic>Mentha arvensis</italic>, MH753576, as 
 <italic>Mentha spicata</italic>, and MH753574, declared as 
 <italic>Mentha suaveolens</italic> cluster with 
 <italic>Mentha longifolia</italic> and 
 <italic>Mentha x piperita</italic>. These plants, which had obviously been mis-identified, were then annotated as 
 <italic>Mentha spec</italic>. (
