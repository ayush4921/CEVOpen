<p>In order to identify candidate compounds responsible for the bioactivity of the plant oils, the cress standard bioassay for seed germination was used, followed by an analysis of the GC profiles of the extracted plant oils. Based on preparatory studies, 0.1 ppm of essential oil extracted from different accessions, were employed, since they produced a substantial inhibition for some oils (

 </xref>). The strongest inhibition of seed germination was observed for the oils from

 <italic>, M. spicata crispa, M. longifolia, A. rugosa</italic>, and 
 <italic>N cataria</italic>, while the oil from 
 <italic>M. suaveolens</italic> (just confirmed as 
 <italic>M. spec</italic>.), 
 <italic>M. x piperita</italic>, and 
 <italic>Melissa officinalis</italic> inhibited cress germination only mildly. As positive control, we used two essential oils obtained from two species designated as Lemon Myrtle (
 <italic>Leptospermum citratum</italic> and 
 <italic>Backhousia citriodora</italic>), because these are rich in citral, a compound with known allelopathic activity (

In order to get insight into the chemical compounds responsible for this bioactivity, the oils from these ten accessions were analyzed by GC, and many peaks identified and measured using commercially available standards (
