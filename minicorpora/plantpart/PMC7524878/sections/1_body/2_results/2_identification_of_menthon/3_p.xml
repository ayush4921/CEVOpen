If an essential would be composed only of one compound and this compound would give full inhibition, a bioactivity score of 10,000 would result. The largest scores obtained in this assay were around 1,000 (

 </xref>). From this analysis, three candidates emerged (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">
  <bold>Figure 2C</bold>
 </xref>): menthone/isomenthone (since both compounds interconvert easily by enolization, they were pooled), β-citral (isomeric with α-citral), and carvone. Citral has already been described as allelopathic compound with anti-microtubular activity (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Chaimovitsh et al., 2010</xref>), and, thus, served as a positive control for the feasibility of the approach, carvone, while being the most active compound, was mainly found in an accession of unclear identity (
 <italic>M. spicata</italic>, which in fact clustered with 
 <italic>M. x piperita</italic>). We focused therefore on the third compound, menthone/isomenthone, which was most abundant in 
 <italic>M. longifolia</italic> and in 
 <italic>A. rugosa</italic>. The comparison of GC profiles for the oils from 
 <italic>M. longifolia</italic> and 
 <italic>A. rugosa</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">
  <bold>Figure 2B</bold>
 </xref>) show in both cases abundance of menthone and isomenthone, but also clear differences in the chemical speciation: while the overall content of menthone and isomenthone was comparable in both species (around 30% relative peak area), 
 <italic>M. longifolia</italic> harbours menthol as main component (more than 50% relative peak area), which is barely detectable in the essential oil from 
 <italic>A. rugosa</italic>. Instead, 
 <italic>A. rugosa</italic> oil contains significant amounts of the menthone precursors limonene and pulegone. Based on the abundance of compounds and the high bioactivity score of menthone, we determined dose-response relationships for the inhibition caused by menthone/isomenthone, menthol as their derivative, limonene as their precursor, and linalool as chemically similar monoterpene with differing structural features (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">
  <bold>Figure 3</bold>
 </xref>). In order to account for possible effects of solvents, 0.1 ppm n-hexane, and 0.1 ppm ethanol were used as solvent controls. Both had only negligible effect on the germination of seeds. A dose-dependent effect on germination was observed when 0.01, 0.1, and 1 ppm of menthone/isomenthone, menthol, linalool, and limonene were used (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">
  <bold>Figure 3</bold>
 </xref>). The strongest effect can be seen with menthone/isomenthone, where even a low concentration of 0.01 ppm inhibits the germination by about 70%, which rose to almost 99% at a concentration of 1 ppm. The least effects were observed for limonene, where even with a high concentration of 1 ppm the inhibition was just 20%. Menthol and linalool produced a similar pattern, where a dose-dependent gradual increase could be seen. The shape of the fitted sigmoidal curves differed. For concentrations up to 0.1 ppm, both, menthol and linalool inhibited only mildly (between 30 and 40%, as compared to 80% for menthone/isomenthone). Only at the highest concentration, 1 ppm, they reached to the level seen for menthone/isomenthone. Thus, menthone/isomenthone emerged as most promising candidate for the inhibitory effect of 
 <italic>M. longifolia</italic>, and 
 <italic>A. rugosa</italic> essential oils, while their structurally similar precursor limonene, as well as their structurally similar derivative menthol, was much less active.
