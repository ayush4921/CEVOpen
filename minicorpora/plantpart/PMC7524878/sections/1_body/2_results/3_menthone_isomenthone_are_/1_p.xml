<p>To get insight into the mode of action of the bioactive candidate compounds identified in the essential oils, we probed for the potential cytotoxicity of menthone/isomenthone (the commercially available product was a racemate of around 80% menthone and 20% isomenthone), its precursor limonene, and its derivative menthol (

 </xref>), along with 0.2% v/vn-hexane, and 0.2% v/v ethanol as solvent controls in tobacco BY-2 cells. Mortality was scored using the Evans Blue Dye Exclusion test in a time-course experiment, testing mortality at 15 or 30 min after addition of 1 µl (corresponding to 0.2% v/v) of the respective compound (

 </xref>). To test a potential impact of the cytoskeleton, in addition with the non-transformed BY-2 cells (WT), two cytoskeletal marker lines were tested: the actin marker line GF11, where actin is labelled by overexpression of the actin binding domain 2 of fimbrin with GFP (FABD2-GFP), and the microtubule marker line TuB6, where microtubules are labelled by overexpression of 
 <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> β-tubulin 6 fused to GFP (TuB6-GFP). In non-transformed BY-2 cells (

 </xref>, top), menthone/isomenthone induced a rapid increase of mortality, already after 15 min, more than 90% of the cells were dead. In contrast, limonene was mostly ineffective with only 20% mortality reached after 30 min, menthol exerted intermediate cytotoxity, which developed slower (at 15 min, only 25% of the cells were killed, while at 30 min, mortality had increased over 60%), and the solvent control did not produce any significant mortality. The time course was almost identical in the actin-marker line (

  <bold>Figure 4B</bold>
 </xref>, centre). For the microtubule-marker line, the response to limonene was basically unaltered, and the response to menthone/isomenthone, which was already saturated in the non-transformed WT, was still close to saturation. A clear difference was observed for the response to menthol, however (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">
  <bold>Figure 4B</bold>
 </xref>, bottom): here, the amplitude of the response was significantly amplified by around the half to reach almost 90% mortality after 30 min. Since the concentration of menthone/isomenthone in the time-course experiment was close to saturation, we conducted then a dose-response study with lower concentrations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">
  <bold>Figure 4C</bold>
 </xref>). This experiment revealed clearly that the sensitivity of the microtubule marker line was elevated, because saturation was reached at around 4-fold lower concentrations of menthone/isomenthone as compared to the wild type. Interestingly, also the actin marker line was somewhat more sensitive than the non-transformed WT, albeit not to the same extent.
