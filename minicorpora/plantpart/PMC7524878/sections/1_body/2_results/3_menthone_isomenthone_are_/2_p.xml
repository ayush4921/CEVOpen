<p>To get more insight into the type of cell death induced by menthone/isomenthone, its precursor limonene, and the essential oil of 
 <italic>A. rugosa</italic>, a double-staining strategy using two fluorescent dyes differing in their membrane permeability was administered (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Doniak et al., 2016</xref>). Since one of these dyes, Acridine Orange, permeates the plasma membrane, while the other dye, Ethidium Bromide, can reach the nucleus only after the plasma membrane had lost integrity, the color of the nucleus will change from green (when the plasma membranes is still tight,

 </xref>) over orange to red (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">
  <bold>Supplementary Figure S2F</bold>
 </xref>), depending on the degree, to which the plasma membrane is permeabilized. The frequency distributions, constructed over the different concentrations (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">
  <bold>Supplementary Figure S2</bold>
 </xref>), show clearly that menthone/isomenthone induced membrane permeability at significantly lower doses and to a significantly higher amplitude (

  <bold>Supplementary Figure S2A</bold>
 </xref>) as compared to limonene (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">
  <bold>Supplementary Figure S2B</bold>
 </xref>), or the essential oil of 
 <italic>A. rugosa</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">
  <bold>Supplementary Figure S2C</bold>
 </xref>). For menthone/isomenthone, from 0.25% (v/v) the Ethidium Bromide label had penetrated into the vast majority of cells within the incubation time of 15Â min. The nuclei in those cells displayed a rough and irregular surface and in some cases, there were even indications of blebbing (

 </xref>, arrow). The fact that compounds that are closely related in terms of structure differ in cytotoxicity, and that the effects of menthone/isomenthone and menthol are enhanced in cells, where microtubules have been mildly stabilised argues for a specific activity of menthone/isomenthone. We, therefore, followed this further focussing on microtubules as potential target.
