<p>As outgroup for the Lamiaceae, we tested essential oil obtained from 
 <italic>Leptospermum citratum</italic>, which also had been observed to strongly inhibit germination (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">
  <bold>Figure 2A</bold>
 </xref>). In fact, this oil also exhibited a strong microtubule-eliminating activity (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">
  <bold>Supplementary Figure S1</bold>
 </xref>), and was found to be rich in citral (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">
  <bold>Figure 2C</bold>
 </xref>), a compound, for which a strong activity against microtubules had been reported in previous studies (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Chaimovitsh et al., 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Chaimovitsh et al., 2012</xref>). We observed that citral A made microtubules appear thinner as in the control (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">
  <bold>Supplementary Figure S1C</bold>
 </xref>), albeit the effect was weaker than that seen for the essential oil from 
 <italic>Leptospermum citratum</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">
  <bold>Supplementary Figure S1B</bold>
 </xref>), and also much milder than the effect evoked by menthone/isomenthone (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">
  <bold>Figures 6E, F</bold>
 </xref>).
