<p>We followed the response of microtubules to the essential oil of 
 <italic>A. rugosa</italic> by spinning-disc confocal microscopy. The tested oils and pure compounds were administered such that they were not in direct contact with the cells, but had to reach their target through the gas phase. Thus, the effective concentrations were much lower than in the mortality assays described before. While the solvent control (n-hexane) did not solicit any microtubule response (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">
  <bold>Figures 5A, B</bold>
 </xref>), microtubules were almost completely eliminated after 30 min exposure to the essential oil of 
 <italic>A. rugosa</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">
  <bold>Figures 5C, D</bold>
 </xref>). Only very thin (but still relatively long) remnants of the microtubules were seen, while a diffuse fluorescence was observed in the cytoplasm, and a bright, but diffuse signal accumulated at the cross walls. We also tested the essential oil from 
 <italic>M. longifolia</italic>, which had been found to inhibit germination to a similar extent as the oil from 
 <italic>A. rugosa</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">
  <bold>Figure 2A</bold>
 </xref>). However, here microtubules were not affected (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">
  <bold>Figures 5E, F</bold>
 </xref>), but remained intact as in the solvent control. In the next step, we repeated the experiment with menthone/isomenthone, its precursor limonene, and its derivative menthol (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">
  <bold>Figure 6</bold>
 </xref>). While microtubules in the solvent control (ethanol) remained intact (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">
  <bold>Figures 6A, B</bold>
 </xref>), they were rapidly eliminated by menthone/isomenthone (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">
  <bold>Figures 6E, F</bold>
 </xref>). The response was so fast that already at 5 min, the earliest time point that was technically observable, microtubules appeared significantly thinner (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">
  <bold>Figure 6E</bold>
 </xref>) as compared to the solvent control (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">
  <bold>Figure 6A</bold>
 </xref>). After exposure to menthone/isomenthone for 30 min, only very thin, barely visible, microtubules remained. Similar to the situation for the essential oil from 
 <italic>A. rugosa</italic>, a diffuse background fluorescence was seen in the cytoplasm (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">
  <bold>Figure 6F</bold>
 </xref>). Also, the precursor limonene made microtubules disappear (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">
  <bold>Figures 6C, D</bold>
 </xref>
 <bold>)</bold>, albeit in a slightly different manner. Here, the signal appeared to coagulate, and there was also no diffuse background fluorescence. In contrast, treatment with menthol did not perturb microtubules (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">
  <bold>Figures 6G, H</bold>
 </xref>).
