<p>To test, whether the effect of menthone/isomenthone was specific for microtubules, we also probed the response of actin filaments using tobacco BY-2 cells expressing the actin-binding domain of plant fimbrin. Here, neither for the essential oil of

 </xref>), nor for menthone/isomenthone (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">
  <bold>Supplementary Figures S3C, D</bold>
 </xref>) any significant elimination of actin filaments was observed, which was in stark contrast to the effect upon microtubules (

  <bold>Figures 5</bold>
 </xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">

 </xref>). Actin microfilaments did show a mild response, though, evident as bundling of fine strands into more prominent cables and the emergence of a perinuclear cage of actin after prolonged incubation (
