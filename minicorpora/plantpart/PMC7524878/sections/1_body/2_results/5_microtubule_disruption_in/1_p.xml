<p>To test, whether the effect of 
 <italic>Agastache rugosa</italic> essential oil, or menthone/isomenthone against microtubules is also observed 
 <italic>in planta</italic>, we used transgenic 
 <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> plants expressing the GFP AtTuB6 marker exposed to either to distilled water (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">
  <bold>Figures 7A, B, E, F</bold>
 </xref>
 <bold>)</bold>, the essential oil from 
 <italic>A. rugosa</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">
  <bold>Figures 7C, D</bold>
 </xref>), or to menthone/isomenthone (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">
  <bold>Figures 7G, H</bold>
 </xref>), respectively, and observed the response immediately after application by spinning disc confocal microscopy. Then, microtubules were observed in pavement cells of the cotyledon epidermis, and the epidermis of the hypocotyl. Under control conditions, the microtubules in the pavement cells of the cotyledon were clearly visible and organized in parallel bundles that were oriented in different directions, usually more or less transverse to the expansion axis of the respective lobe (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">
  <bold>Figures 7A, E</bold>
 </xref>). They were rapidly and thoroughly eliminated by the essential oil from 
 <italic>A. rugosa</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">
  <bold>Figure 7B</bold>
 </xref>), as well as by menthone/isomenthone (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">
  <bold>Figure 7F</bold>
 </xref>), whereby menthone/isomenthone was more effective with only very few microtubular remnants persisting the treatment, while with the essential oil, more microtubules remained. Similar to the situation in tobacco BY-2 cells, a soluble, diffuse fluorescence was observed, which accumulated around vesicular structures that partially agglomerated, best visible in the samples treated by menthone/isomenthone (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">
  <bold>Figure 7F</bold>
 </xref>). Also in the epidermis of the hypocotyl, microtubules were oriented in parallel arrays that were preferentially transverse in younger, still not fully elongated cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">
  <bold>Figure 7C</bold>
 </xref>), while in older, fully elongated cells, they were seen more often in longitudinal direction (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">
  <bold>Figure 7G</bold>
 </xref>). Again, these microtubules were eliminated almost completely by the essential oil of 
 <italic>A. rugosa</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">
  <bold>Figure 7D</bold>
 </xref>), or menthone/isomenthone (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">
  <bold>Figure 7H</bold>
 </xref>). Here, only few microtubules persisted, while, similar to the situation in pavement cells, a diffuse fluorescence surrounding circular or vesicular structures was observed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">
  <bold>Figure 7H</bold>
 </xref>). After treatment with the essential oil from 
 <italic>A. rugosa</italic>, still some microtubules could be observed that displayed a bead-on-a-string pattern indicative of still ongoing disassembly (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">
  <bold>Figure 7D</bold>
 </xref>). To test, whether the effect required direct contact with the oil, or the compounds, the experiment was repeated with a set-up, where the oil, or the compounds had to pass through the gas phase (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4">
  <bold>Supplementary Figure S4B</bold>
 </xref>). Also, in this set-up, the microtubules were disrupted by menthone and the essential oil of 
 <italic>A. rugosa</italic>, while the solvent controls were not effective (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM5">
  <bold>Supplementary Figures S5</bold>
 </xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM6">
  <bold>S6</bold>
 </xref>). To further confirm the effects of the essential oil from 
 <italic>A. rugosa</italic> and menthone/isomenthone, an experiment was setup where seedlings treated with Taxol (providing stability to the microtubules) were treated with the 
 <italic>A. rugosa</italic> essential oil and menthone/isomenthone (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM5">
  <bold>Supplementary Figures S5</bold>
 </xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM6">
  <bold>S6</bold>
 </xref>). Summarizing, the effect of 
 <italic>A. rugosa</italic> essential oil and menthone/isomenthone against microtubules can be clearly confirmed 
 <italic>inÂ planta</italic> as well.
