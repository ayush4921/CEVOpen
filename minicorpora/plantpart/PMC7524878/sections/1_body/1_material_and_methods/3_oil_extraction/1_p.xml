<p>To extract the essential oils for experiments with living plant cells and entire plants, the essential oil was extracted by a simple water-steam distillation method. For each plant species, 30–50 g of fresh leaf material were harvested, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and mildly ground to break up the oil cavities of the glandular hairs. The frozen plant particles and a stirrer bar were added to the still pot, which was then filled until the level of water reached the edge of the heating mantle. The distillation apparatus was filled with distilled water and the water cooling system was connected in a way that enables water flow in the opposite direction of the still. The oil was now distilled by heating the plant material for about two hours to 100°C. The volume of the extracted oil was collected in a graded burette, and the oil phase measured, and, to optimize yield, the tube was washed with a small quantity of n-hexane. Afterward the distillate was sealed in a glass vial and stored at 4°C till experimental use. The oil was later used for various treatments.</p>
