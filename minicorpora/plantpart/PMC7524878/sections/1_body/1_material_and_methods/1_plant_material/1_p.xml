<p>The plants, which were used for oil extraction, were raised at the Botanical Garden of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany, in glass houses. To boost the formation of essential oils, the plants were exposed to sunlight for a few days prior to extraction. Plants of different species were grown in separate pots. The identity of the accessions was verified by taxonomic identification, as well as by genetic barcoding (
