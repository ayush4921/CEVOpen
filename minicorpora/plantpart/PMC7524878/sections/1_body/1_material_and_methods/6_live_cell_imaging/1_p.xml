<p>The response of the cells to the extracted oils, but also to pure candidate compounds identified in those oils was followed by live-cell imaging. The information on purity and sources for these compounds is given in

 </xref>. After three days of cultivation, about 1 ml of cell suspension culture were transferred to a tube and diluted with cultivation medium to a cell density appropriate for microscopic observation. Slides for microscopy were mounted prepared as follows (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4">

 </xref>): a small volume (20 μl) of cell suspension was spread on the slide. Subsequently, close to the cells, but without touching them, 0.5 μl of oil or pure compounds were added on both sides, before a 40 x 24 mm coverslip was placed on the slide. Thus, there was no direct contact between oil and suspension, such that the action of the compounds in the essential oils had to occur through the gas phase. Although the essential oils were not diluted, they contained traces of 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane from the purification process. Therefore, solvent controls with the corresponding volume of 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane were included. Among the candidate compounds, menthol was solid and was dissolved in 10% in ethanol, therefore, ethanol was included as further solvent control. The cells were observed under the Zeiss Cell Observer Spinning Disc (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) equipped with a cooled digital CCD camera (AxioCamMRm), and a spinning-disc device (YOKOGAWA CSU-X1 5000) microscope, using a 20x air, and a 63x oil immersion objective, respectively. The cells were observed under DIC (differential interference contrast (DIC), and after excitation with the blue line (488 nm) of an Ar-Kr laser (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) to detect the GFP signal. For each oil or compound, and each cell line, cells were chosen randomly and followed for 30 min.
