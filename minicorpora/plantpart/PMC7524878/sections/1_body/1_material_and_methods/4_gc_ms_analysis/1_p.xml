<p>The essential oils were analysed by GC-MS analysis at the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology Jena. For GC-MS, a TRACE MS (Thermo-Finnigan) device equipped with a ZB5 column (15 m, 0.25 mm I.D, 0.25 µm film thickness) was used with a 10-m guard column (Phenomenex, Aschaffenburg, Germany). Mass spectra were collected using the electron impact (EI) mode at 70 eV, 33–450 m/z. Volatiles were eluted under programmed conditions: 40°C (2 min isotherm), followed by heating at 10°C min
 <sup>-1</sup> to 220°C and, further, at 30°C min
 <sup>-1</sup> to 280°C, using helium (1.5 ml. min
 <sup>-1</sup>) as carrier gas. The GC injector (split ratio 1:7), transfer line and ion source were set at 220, 280, and 200°C, respectively.
