<p>To test the effect of the oils on the overall viability of the cells, the Evans Blue Dye Exclusion Assay (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Gaff and Okong’ O-Ogola 1971</xref>) was used. Viable cells exclude the dye from their cytoplasm and remain unstained, while dead or dying cells, due to loss of membrane integrity, take up the dye (
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Tisserant et al., 2014</xref>). The effect of the essential oils was assessed in cells with high mitotic activity cells (day 3 after subcultivation) in sampling aliquots. For this purpose, 500 μl of cell suspension were transferred to a reaction tube, and incubated with 0–1 μl of the respective essential oil or compound, for either 15 or 30 min. After incubation, the suspension was transferred to a custom-made cell filter tube (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Nick et al., 2000</xref>). Based on preparative experiments with different staining and rinsing times, a protocol was defined with staining for 5 min in 2.5% Evans Blue, before rinsing the cells in BY-2 cultivation medium three times for 2 min each. Subsequently, 20 μl of the suspension were transferred into onto a hemato-cytometer slide (Fuchs-Rosenthal) and scored under the bright-field microscope. The percentage of observed cells that were unstained was calculated and used as readout for viability. Data represent three independent replications with a population of 600 individual cells per replication.
