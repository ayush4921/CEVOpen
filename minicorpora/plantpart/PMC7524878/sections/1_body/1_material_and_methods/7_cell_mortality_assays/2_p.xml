<p>To obtain a more detailed insight into the mortality induced by essential oil of 
 <italic>A. rugosa</italic>, menthone/isomenthone, or limonene, a double labelling with the membrane permeable dye Acridine Orange and the impermeable dye Ethidium Bromide was conducted (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Doniak et al., 2016</xref>). Aliquots of freshly harvested tobacco BY-2 cells (200 µl) were mixed with the respective compound and incubated for 15 min in a closed reaction tube in the dark at 25°C on an orbital shaker (IKA
 <sup>®</sup>KS 260 basic). Then, a sample of 50 µl was stained with the same volume of staining mixture (100 μg.ml
 <sup>-1</sup>Acridine Orange, and 100 μg.ml
 <sup>-1</sup> Ethidium Bromide in a 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.4) for 5 min. After staining, the sample was diluted with 100 µl of the same buffer, and 50 µl of the mixture transferred to a glass slide, covered with a coverslip and observed by fluorescence microscopy (Diaplan, Leitz) with excitation in the blue (filter set I3, excitation 450–490 nm, beam splitter 510 nm, emission filter &gt;515 nm) using a digital acquisition system (Leica DFC 500) and software (Leica Application Suite, v4). The nuclei of cells with tight membranes will appear green, because they are exclusively labelled by Acridine Orange. With progressive permeabilization of the membrane, the red signal from Ethidium Bromide will increase, such that the nuclei turn over orange into red. This color change was quantified and classified as described in 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Byczkowska et al. (2013)</xref>. Each frequency distribution represents around 250–300 nuclei in each of two experimental series.
