<p>The effect of oil extracted from 
 <italic>A. rugosa</italic> along with menthone was assessed on both, cotyledons and hypocotyls of etiolated 
 <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> seedlings, where either microtubules were labelled with GFP. The line GFP-TuB6 over-expressed a N-terminal fusion of β-tubulin 6 from 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic> N-terminally fused with GFP under a Cauliflower Mosaic Virus (CaMV) 35S promoter generated in the Col-0 background (

The seeds were grown on moist filter paper in a petri dish at 25°C for 5 days in the dark. To assess the effect on the cytoskeleton, 50 µl of either essential oil extracted from 
 <italic>A. rugosa</italic>, or pure menthone were transferred onto a microscopic glass slide. The seedlings were placed directly in the respective liquid, covered by a coverslip, and then the sample was immediately observed by spinning disc microscopy. As negative control, plants were placed in distilled water instead. In a supplementary experiment, the compounds were administered through the gas phase analogous to the time-lapse studies on tobacco BY-2 cells (
