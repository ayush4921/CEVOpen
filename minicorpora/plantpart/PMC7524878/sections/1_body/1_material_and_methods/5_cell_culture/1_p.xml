<p>Different strains of tobacco BY-2 (
 <italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic> L. cv Bright Yellow-2) cell lines (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Nagata et al., 1992</xref>) were used for this study. Cells were sub-cultured in Murashige-Skoog medium at weekly intervals, by inoculating 1.5 ml of stationary culture cells into 30 ml of fresh new medium. The cells were cultivated at 26°C in the dark under constant shaking as described previously (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Maisch and Nick, 2007</xref>). To follow microtubule responses 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, the strain BY2-TuB6-GFP, expressing β-tubulin (AtTUB6) fused to GFP under the control of the constitutive Cauliflower Mosaic Virus 35S promotor was used (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Hohenberger et al., 2011</xref>), while the responses of actin filaments were followed using the strain GF11, expressing the second actin-binding domain of fimbrin (AtFIM1) in fusion with GFP, also under a CaMV-35S promoter (
