<p>In order to quantify allelopathic activity of essential oils, or candidate compounds identified therein, the standard cress germination test (International Seed Testing Association, 
 <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.seedtest.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.seedtest.org</uri>) was performed in Plexiglass boxes (30 mm x 20 mm x 15 mm) that were covered and sealed. The bottom of the boxes was covered with humidified absorbent papers (No. 914446/4; Hartmann, Heidenheim/Brenz, Germany). Hundred seeds of 
 <italic>Lepidium sativum</italic> (var. ‘Glatt’, FloraSelf Co.) per box (30 mm x 20 mm x 15 mm) were sown equidistantly, and a glass slide with filter paper loaded with a defined volume (0.1, 1, or 10 µl corresponding to 0.01, 0.1, or 1 ppm) of the respective compound or the respective solvent was placed in the center of the box. After mounting, the box was sealed with Parafilm, and stored in an incubator with a temperature of 27°C in the dark for two days. After two days, the germinated seedlings were counted, and hypocotyl and root length measured. Each experiment was replicated three times. The resulting dose-response curves were fitted using a sigmoidal model.
