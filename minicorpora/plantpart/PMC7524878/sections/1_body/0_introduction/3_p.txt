0: One strategy to address the specificity of bioactive compounds is to compare related species that differ in their allelopathic effect.
1: So called aromatic plants represent an interesting target, and are known to emit volatile growth inhibitors ( Muller and Muller, 1964;  Weir et al., 2004).
2: Among the aromatic plants, the Lamiaceae are of particular interest, because this family which typically produces a broad repertory of terpenoids and phenolic compounds ( Wink, 2003) is extremely diverse with estimated 7,000 species that often differ in their chemical characteristics, and are grouped into several hundreds of genera ( Harley et al., 2004).
3: The pronounced chemical diversity in this group indicates that chemical signaling directed to other organisms might have been an important driving force in speciation, such that there is a good chance to identify specific allelochemicals.
