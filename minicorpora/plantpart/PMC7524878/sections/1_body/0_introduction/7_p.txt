0: The inhibition of root growth (as well as the genotoxicity) indicates that menthone targets to microtubules.
1: In fact, microtubules are known to be affected by important herbicide classes, such as the dinitroaniline herbicides ( Anthony et al., 1998).
2: Disassembly of mitotic microtubules, by either anti-microtubule drugs or mutations, disrupts mitotic activity, culminating in asymmetries of newly formed cell plates ( Yoneda et al., 2005;  Kawamura et al., 2006;  Vaughn, 2006).
3: Likewise, disassembly of cortical microtubules interferes with the ordered deposition of cellulose microfibrils, such that cell elongation is blocked.
4: Actually, it was the loss of expansion axiality after treatment with colchicine that brought Paul Green to predict the existence of microtubules ( Green, 1962), and, one year later, led to the discovery of microtubules by  Ledbetter and Porter (1963).
5: Disruption of plant microtubules by monoterpenes has already been shown for citral, which can inhibit the expansion growth of  Arabidopsis roots by affecting cortical microtubules ( Chaimovitsh et al., 2010), and also impair the proliferation of tobacco BY-2 cells, accompanied by a high frequency of asymmetric cell walls ( Chaimovitsh et al., 2012).
6: Taxol, a compound which is stabilizing microtubules, was able to protect BY-2 cells from this citral-mediated microtubule disruption, indicative of microtubules as primary targets of citral.
7: Allelopathic effects of Mint have been described for Horse Mint ( M. longifolia, wheat seedlings,  Bajalan et al., 2013) and Peppermint ( M. x piperita, sunflower seedlings,  Skrzypek et al., 2015).
