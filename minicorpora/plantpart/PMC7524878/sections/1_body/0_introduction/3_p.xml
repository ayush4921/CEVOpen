<p>One strategy to address the specificity of bioactive compounds is to compare related species that differ in their allelopathic effect. So called aromatic plants represent an interesting target, and are known to emit volatile growth inhibitors (

 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">Wink, 2003</xref>) is extremely diverse with estimated 7,000 species that often differ in their chemical characteristics, and are grouped into several hundreds of genera (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Harley et al., 2004</xref>). The pronounced chemical diversity in this group indicates that chemical signaling directed to other organisms might have been an important driving force in speciation, such that there is a good chance to identify specific allelochemicals.
