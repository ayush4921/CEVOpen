0: Plants have developed mechanisms to defend and adapt themselves against biotic and abiotic stress factors.
1: As part of this defense, plants can suppress the growth of competing neighbors by releasing chemicals, a process called allelopathy ( Lambers et al., 2008).
2: Allelochemicals can be produced in different organs and can suppress the growth of target plants by different mechanisms upon contact of the allelochemicals with the target plants ( Choesin and Boerner, 1991).
3: Plant essential oils, often with monoterpenes as primary components, accumulate in different vegetative organs, such as leaves, bark, wood, roots, but also in flowers or fruits, sometimes in specialized glands, sometimes in lysogenic or schizogenic oil ducts ( Bruneton, 1995).
4: In order to exert their effect, they have to be released into the environment, which is the reason, why many allelochemicals are volatiles.
5: This leads to an interesting question that has been rarely addressed: how does the source plant prevent that it is not inhibited by its own allelochemicals?
6: One possibility to obtain specificity would be to use compounds that activate a signaling process in the receiving plant that is not activated in the donor plant itself, due to inactivated binding of the compound.
