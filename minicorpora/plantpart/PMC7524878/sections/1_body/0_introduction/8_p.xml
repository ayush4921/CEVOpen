<p>The current study ventured to identify compounds underlying Mint allelopathy and to address their cellular mode of action. This was designed as comparative approach, where the differential bioactivity of different Mint oils was used as logical filter to identify active compounds. This work is built upon three axes: (1) to ensure the validity of our findings, the biodiversity used as input for the approach had to be authenticated, (2) based on this validated biodiversity, a candidate compound correlated with bioactivity could be identified as menthone, (3) menthone-induced elimination of microtubules could be identified as cellular mode of action underlying the allelopathic effect.</p>
