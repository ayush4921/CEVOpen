<p>The differences of oil composition in these closely related species are linked with different bioactivities that are often of medical interest: The oil of Spearmint (
 <italic>M. spicata</italic>) is a natural antioxidant (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Kanatt et al., 2007</xref>), while an extract from Korean Mint (
 <italic>Agastache rugosa</italic>), another member of the Lamiaceae family, inhibits HIV integrase, a protein responsible for integrating the viral DNA into the human genome, and therefore being relevant as a possible target for selective antiviral therapy (

 <italic>M. pulegium</italic> and 
 <italic>M. spicata</italic>, containing mainly pulegone, menthone, and carvone, showed strong insecticide activity on 
 <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, whereby the oil of 
 <italic>M. spicata</italic> was, in addition, mutagenic. Here, pulegone was found to responsible for the activity as insecticide, while the genotoxic activity could be attributed to menthone. Interestingly, the strong toxicity of pulegone was suppressed in the presence of menthone, demonstrating that synergistic or antagonistic interactions between compounds of a given oil are relevant for bioactivity (
