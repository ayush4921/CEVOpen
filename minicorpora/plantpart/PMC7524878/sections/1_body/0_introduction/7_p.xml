<p>The inhibition of root growth (as well as the genotoxicity) indicates that menthone targets to microtubules. In fact, microtubules are known to be affected by important herbicide classes, such as the dinitroaniline herbicides (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Anthony et al., 1998</xref>). Disassembly of mitotic microtubules, by either anti-microtubule drugs or mutations, disrupts mitotic activity, culminating in asymmetries of newly formed cell plates (

 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Kawamura et al., 2006</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Vaughn, 2006</xref>). Likewise, disassembly of cortical microtubules interferes with the ordered deposition of cellulose microfibrils, such that cell elongation is blocked. Actually, it was the loss of expansion axiality after treatment with colchicine that brought Paul Green to predict the existence of “microtubules” (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Green, 1962</xref>), and, one year later, led to the discovery of “microtubules” by 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Ledbetter and Porter (1963)</xref>. Disruption of plant microtubules by monoterpenes has already been shown for citral, which can inhibit the expansion growth of 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> roots by affecting cortical microtubules (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Chaimovitsh et al., 2010</xref>), and also impair the proliferation of tobacco BY-2 cells, accompanied by a high frequency of asymmetric cell walls (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Chaimovitsh et al., 2012</xref>). Taxol, a compound which is stabilizing microtubules, was able to protect BY-2 cells from this citral-mediated microtubule disruption, indicative of microtubules as primary targets of citral.
