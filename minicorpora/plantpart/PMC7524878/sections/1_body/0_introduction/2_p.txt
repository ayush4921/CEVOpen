0: Since allelopathy is specific, it offers interesting applications for biological pest control.
1: In fact, plants producing essential oils have been used extensively for growth regulation, herbicidal, insecticidal, or other agricultural applications ( Bajalan et al., 2013;  Cheng and Cheng, 2015;  Skrzypek et al., 2015).
2: Biocontrol by essential oils has a long historyfor instance, these oils were the first food preservatives used by humans ( Thompson, 1989), and often already the crude extracts have been found to exert efficient antifungal, antimicrobial, cytostatic, and insecticidal activities ( Sivropoulou et al., 1995;  Mkaddem et al 2008).
3: In some cases, the bioactivity has already been broken down to individual compounds.
4: For instance, oil from  Artemisia scoparia can inhibit germination and seedling growth of three weeds, and this allelopathic effect could be attributed to its major constituent, -myrcene ( Singh et al., 2009).
5: Components from  Eucalyptus essential oil, such as eucalyptol, - and -pinene, camphene and camphor were reported to inhibit cell proliferation in roots by interfering with DNA synthesis in organelles and nucleus of the  Brassica campestris root meristem ( Nishida et al., 2005).
6: Monoterpenes (camphor and menthol) have been found to affect stomatal opening through cytoskeletal changes as a response to the monoterpenes and have effects on the growth of  Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings ( Kriegs et al., 2010).
7: Similarly, citral was found to be a strong inhibitor of seed germination in  Triticum sativum,  Amaranthus palmeri and  Brassica nigra ( Dudai et al., 1999).
8: However, in many cases, it has remained unclear which compound or which mixture of compounds is responsible for the alellopathic effect of a given essential oil, such that the mechanisms behind the specificity of allelopathy have remained fairly elusive.
