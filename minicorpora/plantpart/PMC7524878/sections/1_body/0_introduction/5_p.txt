0: Commercial use is concentrated around Peppermint ( M. x piperita), Spearmint ( M. spicata), and Corn Mint ( M. canadensis).
1: While for the first two species, often leaf material is used, for instance as herbal tea, corn mint is exclusively cultivated for oil production ( Small, 1997;  Oudhia, 2003).
2: The main compounds of  Mentha essential oils are monoterpenes like limonene, menthone, and menthol, which are synthesized in glandular trichomes on the leaf surface ( Turner et al., 2000).
3: Although coming from closely related species, the essential oils from the different Mints show characteristic differences in composition: While the economically dominating essential oil from Peppermint ( M. x piperita) contains menthol and menthone as main components ( Gul, 1994), Corn Mint ( M. canadensis) is interesting as the richest source of natural menthol ( Sharma and Tyagi, 1991;  Shasany et al., 2000), while Spearmint ( M. spicata) is rich in carvone and therefore widely used as spice in several countries ( Kokkini et al., 1995).
