<p>Even among the chemically diverse Lamiaceae, the Mints excel by their rich chemical diversity, where even accessions from the same species differ with respect to the composition of their essential oils (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Kokkini, 1991</xref>). Using this diversity as platform for an activity-guided fractionation approach, we identified menthone/isomenthone as compound with a strong inhibitory effect on seed germination, possibly responsible for the strong effect of 
 <italic>A. rugosa</italic> essential oil. This finding is compatible with previous work, where menthone has been identified as major component in 
 <italic>A. rugosa</italic> (
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">Zielińska et al., 2017</xref>), and was found to exert a moderate inhibition of germination in a comparative study of different monoterpenes (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Martino et al., 2010</xref>), albeit at very high concentrations and only in radish, while not effective in cress. The inhibitory effect of 
 <italic>A. rugosa</italic> essential oil and menthone/isomenthone correlated well with an elimination of microtubules, seen both, in tobacco BY-2 cells as well as in different tissues of 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seedlings. This effect was specific for microtubules and not seen for actin filaments, which is reminiscent for the effect of the monoterpene citral (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Chaimovitsh et al., 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Chaimovitsh et al., 2012</xref>). We have, therefore, included two species of Lemon Myrtle (
 <italic>Backhousia citriodora, Leptospermum citratum</italic>) as positive controls into the study, because the essential oils from these species are rich in citral (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">
  <bold>Figure 2C</bold>
 </xref>), and we were able to see a strong inhibition of germination (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">
  <bold>Figure 2A</bold>
 </xref>), and a strong elimination of microtubules (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">
  <bold>Supplementary Figure S1B</bold>
 </xref>), as to be inferred from the 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Chaimovitsh et al. (2010)</xref>. The elimination of microtubules is accompanied by the increase of diffuse background signal in the cytoplasm, presumably representing non-polymerised tubulin heterodimers. This was observed both, for the essential oil of 
 <italic>A. rugosa</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">
  <bold>Figure 5D</bold>
 </xref>), as for menthone/isomentone (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">
  <bold>Figure 6F</bold>
 </xref>), and indicates that microtubules are not disrupted, but that the assembly or elongation of microtubules is impaired such that microtubules are eliminated due to their innate turnover. Again, this is reminiscent to the mode of action of citral: here, the association of γ-tubulin, an essential component of microtubule nucleation was disrupted (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Chaimovitsh et al., 2012</xref>), as well as the assembly of microtubules 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Chaimovitsh et al., 2010</xref>). As discussed above, the elimination of microtubules seems to be responsible for the subsequent cell death and loss of membrane integrity. However, the mechanism linking microtubule elimination to cell death is still unknown, but the elevated sensitivity of the BY-2 strain overexpressing TuB6-GFP, as compared to the non-transformed wild type, indicates that it is the excess of non-polymerised tubulin heterodimers that triggers cell death. This would be in line with a phenomenon observed all over the eukaryotes, where overexpression of tubulins causes lethality (yeast: 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Katz et al., 1990</xref>; maize: 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Anthony and Hussey, 1998</xref>). In fact, the steady-state levels of tubulin heterodimers are regulated very tightly by both, post-translational, and transcriptional control circuits (for review see 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Breviario and Nick, 2000</xref>). We are currently pursuing the hypothesis, whether metacaspases, components of the machinery executing programmed cell death (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Gong et al., 2019</xref>) might be activated depending on their association with microtubules.
