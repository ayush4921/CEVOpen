<p>Using a comparative approach, the allelopathic effects of essential oils from different Mints were tested using the standard cress germination assay. Based on the correlation between bioactivity and chemical composition, menthone/isomenthone was identified as a prime candidate for the allelopathic effect and then analyzed further with respect to the mode of action. We can show that menthone/isomenthone causes a rapid elimination of microtubules in both tobacco BY-2 cells and seedlings of 
 <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. This effect is specific for microtubules and not seen for actin. It is also specific with respect to structure and function of the compound and much weaker for the structurally closely related menthol. The mortality induced by menthone/isomenthone depends on tubulin abundance since it is accentuated in a BY-2 strain overexpressing a GFP-tagged tubulin as compared to non-transformed cells. The resulting mortality is preceded by permeabilization of the plasma membrane. These key findings lead to several scientific questions, but also bear on future applications. In the following, we will explore the anti-microtubular activity of menthone/isomenthone from different viewpoints: (i) What can we infer on the potential causal relationship with cytotoxicity? (ii) What can we infer on the potential functional context? (iii) What can we infer on the potential molecular mechanism? (iv)What are potentials and challenges of application?
