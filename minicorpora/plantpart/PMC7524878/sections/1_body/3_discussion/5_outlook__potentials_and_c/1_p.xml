<p>Weeds are one major reason for yield lossesâ€”for instance, just for India alone the damage caused by weeds is estimated to range at around 4.4 billion US$ per year (

While herbicides had been a central asset for the success of the so called Green Revolution, there has been growing concern about the hazardous effects of synthetic herbicides, and the problem of herbicide resistance (for a classical review see
