<p>Microtubules provide a promising target for several groups of herbicide including the phenyl carbamates, or the dinitroanilines, such as trifluralin or oryzalin (reviewed in 
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Vaughn, 2000</xref>). This mode of action has certain drawbacks, though: tubulin is a fairly conservative molecule, and a compound interfering with plant microtubules is likely to interfere with animal microtubules as well, such that these compounds would be potentially cancerogenic or mutagenic. However, these herbicides acting against microtubules target to molecular moieties, where plant and animal tubulins differ, such as the C-terminus of α-tubulin targeted by phenylcarbamates (
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Wiesler et al., 2002</xref>), or an amino-acid substitution in the N-terminal region of α-tubulin that allows the binding of dinitroanilines in plants, but not in animals (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Anthony et al., 1998</xref>). A second strategy to obtain plant-specific microtubule elimination would be not to target tubulin directly, but to target the signalling that culminates in microtubule elimination. Signalling in plant cells is fundamentally different, and there is plenty of room to find specific targets that do not occur in animal cells. This is the strategy, which we propose in the current work. There are still several tasks to be solved to render menthone/isomenthone or the essential oil of 
 <italic>A. rugosa</italic> into a tool applicable as bioherbicide. One problem is the volatility—on the one hand, this property allows for efficient spread, on the other hand, it will cause rapid decay of the pool that has been administered to the field. Here, we are currently testing different slow-release carriers under conditions that are close to agricultural application.
