<p>The rapid elimination of microtubules (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">
  <bold>Figures 6E, F</bold>
 </xref>) in response to menthone/isomenthone is accompanied by a loss of membrane integrity and cell death (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">
  <bold>Figure 4</bold>
 </xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">
  <bold>Supplementary Figure S2</bold>
 </xref>). This allows two interpretations: the microtubule elimination could act upstream and release a cellular response leading to a unspecific permeabilization of the membrane, or, inversely, menthone/isomenthone could lead to a permeabilization of the membrane that would kill the cells and, secondarily, cause a breakdown of microtubules. There are several arguments against the second scenario: first, the biological effect is specific with respect to structure: the structurally closely related menthol is much less effective as compared to menthone/isomenthone (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">
  <bold>Figures 3</bold>
 </xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">
  <bold>4</bold>
 </xref>, and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">
  <bold>6</bold>
 </xref>), although it is very efficient as membrane permeabilizer (
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Wang and Meng, 2017</xref>). Along the same line, menthone/isomenthone is effective at lower dosage in BY-2 cells overexpressing the TuB6-GFP marker as compared to the non-transformed WT (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">
  <bold>Figure 4C</bold>
 </xref>) which speaks against unspecific membrane permeabilization as primary cause for microtubule elimination. Furthermore, under conditions, where microtubules are completely eliminated (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">
  <bold>Figures 6E, F</bold>
 </xref>), actin filaments still persist (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">
  <bold>Supplementary Figures 3C, D</bold>
 </xref>), which would not be expected, when the cytoskeletal response would be the unspecific consequence of cell death. Furthermore, the response of microtubules seems to occur more swiftly than the permeabilization of the membrane: When the cells were treated with menthone/isomenthone through the gas phase, i.e. at very low effective concentrations, already at the earliest testable time point, 5 min after exposure to menthone/isomenthone, microtubules were significantly affected as compared to the solvent control (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">
  <bold>Figure 6</bold>
 </xref>), while with direct contact at much higher concentrations, even after 15 min many cells still had retained a partial membrane integrity (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">
  <bold>Supplementary Figure 2A</bold>
 </xref>). Similar to menthol, menthone/isomenthone can permeabilize membranes (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Lan et al., 2016</xref>), probably interacting with the polar moiety of phospholipids and ceramides, such that a physical contact with microtubules might be conceivable. However, the fact that the microtubule response was observed under conditions, where membrane permeability was retained, speaks rather for a specific binding site at the outer face of the plasma membrane that deploys a cellular response culminating in the disassembly of microtubules. This conclusion is also consistent with results of a study, where a panel of monoterpenes was tested with respect to microtubule degradation (using a transgenic 
 <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>line over-expressing the GFP-tagged alpha tubulin TUA6), and the plasma membrane was assessed using the endocytosis marker FM4-64 (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Chaimovitsh et al., 2017</xref>). It was found that only Limonene, out of the compounds used in the study, at low concentration was affecting the membrane as shown both by FM4-64 staining and by membrane leakage test.
