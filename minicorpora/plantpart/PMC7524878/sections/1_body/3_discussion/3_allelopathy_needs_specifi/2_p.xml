<p>Even so, several cases could be detected, where accessions had been incorrectly assigned, which, if it had remained unnoticed, would have the potential to create considerable confusion, since the bioactivity differed considerable between different accessions. For instance, the wrongly assigned 
 <italic>M. suaveolens</italic> produced low allelopathic activity, while the correctly assigned 
 <italic>M. longifolia</italic> was very effective (

  <bold>Figure 2A</bold>
 </xref>). Unfortunately, the detected cases of wrongly assigned accessions are not a mishap, but a general problem, as demonstrated by a systematic study estimating that around half of tropical species in public collections are mislabelled (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Goodwin et al., 2015</xref>). If biodiversity is used as input for functional studies such as the current research, this problem has to be addressed. While genetic barcoding has acquired attention as powerful strategy to authenticate (for a recent review see 
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Thakur et al., 2019</xref>), any barcode is only as good as the reference plant is authentic. Unfortunately, this aspect is often neglected, when sequences collected from commercial samples are deposited in public databases without any further authentication of the material. Again, a recent systematic study has found that considerable proportions (ranging from around 25% in Asia up to 80% in Australia) of commercial herbal products were adulterated (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Ichim, 2019</xref>). This will create considerable spill-over of wrongly assigned sequence information in public databases. We have, therefore, for good reasons, used only curated sequence information, where the database entry gave some information about species identification and voucher material, and we strongly recommend that this should become common practice in any work involving genetic barcoding. Thus, the quality of genetic barcoding depends on the care, by which the respective specimen has been taxonomically identified. There is clearly a bottleneck, as accentuated in the conclusion by 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Goodwin et al. (2015)</xref>: 
 <italic>“Rapidly increasing numbers of specimens in an increasing numbers of herbaria are not being revised because there are too few taxonomists.”</italic>. Molecular methods, as powerful as they are, do not rescue us from this bottleneck.
