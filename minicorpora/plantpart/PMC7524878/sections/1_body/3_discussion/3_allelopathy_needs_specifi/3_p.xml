<p>Putting aside these methodological considerations, the pronounced species dependency of the allelopathic effect leads to some interesting biological questions: When allelopathy is used as tool to outcompete other species (possibly even from the same genus—some of the investigated Mints do occur sympatrically), there must be a mechanism that prevents self-inhibition of the donor. In case of a non-specific cellular activity, this would only be achieved by controlling the spread of the compound in space. While this seems to be the case for the production, contained to the excretion cavity of glandular hairs and scales, this is certainly not true once the essential oil is released. If, however, the effect of the compounds is linked to the presence of specific binding sites at the membrane of the receiver cell, the donor could protect itself by mutating or protecting this binding site and thus reducing it sensitivity. Thus, identification and functional analysis for the menthone/isomenthone binding site represents a crucial issue to get deeper insight into the functional context of this allelopathic interaction.</p>
