<p>We used a collection of different Mints as input for this study and found qualitative differences with respect to chemical profile and bioactivity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">
  <bold>Figure 2</bold>
 </xref>), supporting the notion that allelopathic activity acts in a very specific manner. Since Mints belong to the taxonomically more challenging clades of the already challenging family of Lamiaceae, comprising estimated 7,000 species, authentication of the material used for bioactivity screening is mandatory. Moreover, Lindley’s 
 <italic>dictum</italic> that Lamiacean taxonomy with its excessive synonyms and ambiguities became “the disgrace of Botany” (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Lindley, 1829</xref>), although improved over the last years, still holds valid. We used the genetic barcoding marker 
 <italic>psbA-trnH intergenic spacer</italic>, which for the Lamiaceae genus 
 <italic>Ocimum</italic> was shown to provide better resolution than other markers (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Jürges et al., 2018</xref>). While it was possible to discern 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> from the other genera, and even several species within the genus, albeit often with low bootstrap support (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">
  <bold>Figure 1</bold>
 </xref>), the two species 
 <italic>M. x piperita</italic> and 
 <italic>M. longifolia</italic> were not discriminated. This might be due to hybridization events that would not be detected by a marker located in the plastid genome, such as 
 <italic>psbA-trnH intergenic spacer</italic> (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Gobert et al., 2006</xref>). This certainly represents a limitation of the otherwise powerful approach to use such organelle markers for genetic barcoding.
