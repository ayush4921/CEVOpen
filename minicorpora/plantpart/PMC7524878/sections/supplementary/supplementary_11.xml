  <p>Mortality of BY2 cells after treatment with menthone/isomenthone, limonene and oil extracted from 
   <italic>A rugosa</italic>, characterized by differential cellular staining. Frequency distribution of stages of cell death after treatment with menthone/isomenthone 
   <bold>(A)</bold>, limonene 
   <bold>(B)</bold>, and essential oil from 
   <italic>A. rugosa</italic>
   <bold>(C)</bold>. The color code shows different stages of cell death ranging from living cells to dead cells. 
   <bold>(D)</bold> Control cells stained with a combination of Acridine Orange and Ethidium Bromide shows intact plasma membrane. 
   <bold>(E)</bold> Disintegration of plasma membrane after treatment with 0.25% v/v menthone/isomenthone. 
   <bold>(F)</bold> Nuclei with perturbed shape after treatment with menthone/isomenthone, after double staining with Acridine Orange and Ethidium Bromide.
