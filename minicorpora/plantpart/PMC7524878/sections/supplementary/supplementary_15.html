 <caption> The seedlings exposed to either a gas phase of 50 µl n-hexane as a solvent control (B), menthone/isomenthone (C), or oil extracted from A rugosa (D) were compared to control (A). Plants were treated in 10 µM Taxol (Paclitaxel) for 1 h (E) before exposure to either the gas phase from 50 µl of n-hexane (F), menthone/isomenthone (G) or oil extracted from A. rugosa (H) in epidermal cells of the hypocotyl. The time interval between mounting and observation was 5 min. Scale Bar is of 25 µm. </caption>
