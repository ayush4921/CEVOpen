  <p>Response of cortical microtubules in etiolated seedlings of 
   <italic>A thaliana</italic> expressing GFP TuB6 to compounds administered through the gas phase. Plants were grown on ½ MS agar plates supplemented with 1% w/v sucrose for 5 d in the the dark at 25°C. The seedlings exposed to either a gas phase of 50 µl n-hexane as a solvent control 
   <bold>(B)</bold>, menthone/isomenthone 
   <bold>(C)</bold> or oil extracted from 
   <italic>A rugosa</italic>
   <bold>(D)</bold> were compared to control 
   <bold>(A)</bold>. Plants were treated in 10 µM Taxol (Paclitaxel) for 1 h (E, I, K) before exposure to either the gas phase from 50 µl of 
   <italic>n</italic>-hexane 
   <bold>(F)</bold>, menthone/isomenthone 
   <bold>(G, J)</bold> or oil extracted from 
   <italic>A. rugosa</italic>
   <bold>(H, L)</bold> either in epidermal pavement cells of the cotyledon 
   <bold>(A–H)</bold> or the shoot apical meristem 
   <bold>(I–L)</bold>. The time interval between mounting and observation was 5 min. Scale Bar is of 25 µm.
