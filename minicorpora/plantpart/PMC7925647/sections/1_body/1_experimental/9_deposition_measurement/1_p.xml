<p id="Par17">A droplet test card (oil-sensitive paper/water-sensitive paper, 2.6 cm × 7.6 cm) was used to test the effect of droplet deposition in the field when the formulation was sprayed by the plant protection UAV. The width of each measurement area was 9 m, which was suitable for the UAV to fly across three times. Three points were randomly selected from each of the three flight paths, and nine sampling points were investigated. A test card was fixed using a paper clip to the cotton plant canopy at each sampling point to collect droplets. At the end of the experiment, the droplet test cards were scanned using a scanner. Image-pro Plus software was used to analyze droplet size, droplet coverage and droplet deposition density on the test cards, and droplet distribution uniformity was calculated.</p>
