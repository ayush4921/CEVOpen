<p id="Par13">An indoor spraying device was used to simulate field application using the plant protection UAV. A spray particle size analyzer was used to test the atomization performance of the thidiazuronÂ·diuron ultra-low-volume (ULV) spray and to analyze the effect of viscosity on droplet size and particle size distribution.</p>
