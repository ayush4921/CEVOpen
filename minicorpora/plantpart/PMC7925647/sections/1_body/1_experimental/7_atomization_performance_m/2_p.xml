<p id="Par14">The indoor spraying device consisted of a DC voltage stabilized power supply, a peristaltic pump, and a rotary atomizer. The current of the DC voltage stabilized power supply was set to 1.00 A, and the voltage was adjusted to the range of 12–24 V. A laser tachometer was used to test the rotation speed of the rotary atomizer at various voltages. To analyze the stability of the rotary atomizer, a linear fitting of voltage and rotation speed was performed. The discharge of the peristaltic pump was set to 100 mL/min, and water was used as a spray. A spray particle size analyzer was used to test the size and distribution of the droplets ejected by the rotary atomizer at high-speed rotation. By analyzing the relationship between droplet size and the rotation speed of the rotary atomizer, the conditions for producing uniformly distributed droplets were found. Samples were sprayed according to the optimized conditions. Cumulative volume diameter and distribution information were collected to analyze the effect of formulation viscosity on atomization performance. The droplet size distribution (Rs) was calculated according to Eq. (
