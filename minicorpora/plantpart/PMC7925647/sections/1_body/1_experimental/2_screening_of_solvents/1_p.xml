<p id="Par8">Different organic solvents were added to 0.2 g thidiazuron and 0.1 g diuron. After shaking uniformly, samples were heated in a water bath and subjected to ultrasonic oscillation to dissolve them. Since heating increases the volatilization of organic solvents, the temperature of the water bath did not exceed 35 °C, and the time of ultrasonic oscillation did not exceed 20 min. After this time, the dissolution state of the original pesticide was observed and the dissolution effects of different solvent combinations were compared.</p>
