<p id="Par10">Thidiazuron and diuron were placed into a 250 mL beaker, then different organic solvents were added and stirred at 200 rpm for 20 min. After dissolving completely, the anionic adjuvant was added and stirred until the system was clear. Next, the nonionic adjuvant was added and stirred. After mixing to uniformity, chlorinated paraffin and methyl oleate were added sequentially, followed by stirring at 250 rpm for 25 min. The resulting pale yellow, single transparent, homogeneous liquid containing thidiazuron and diuron was used as an ultra-low-volume spray.</p>
