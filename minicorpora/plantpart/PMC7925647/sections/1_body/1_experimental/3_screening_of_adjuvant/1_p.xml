 </sup>. Based on solvent screening, anionic and nonionic adjuvants were selected to build a stable pesticide loading system. The ultra-low-volume spray used a high-boiling-point oily solvent as a low-volatility carrier to facilitate the deposition of small droplets

 </sup>. Methyl oleate is a methylated vegetable oil adjuvant with good biodegradability and low toxicity, and this was added as the oily solvent. Characteristics of an ultra-low-volume spray are low dosage and high concentration

 </sup>. Droplets produced by spraying are extremely fine and easily drift, causing phytotoxicity to non-target organisms. It is necessary to add fillers to increase the viscosity and density of the formulation, reducing the risk of drift and phytotoxicity. Therefore, chlorinated paraffin was used as the filler at a proportion of 25%.
