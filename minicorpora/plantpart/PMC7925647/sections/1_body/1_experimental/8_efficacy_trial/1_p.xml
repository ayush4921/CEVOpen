<p id="Par15">In September 2017, an efficacy trial of the thidiazuron·diuron ultra-low-volume spray was carried out at the cotton planting base of Xinjiang Agricultural University in Shawan County (44° 19′ 31.92″ E, 85°37′ 0.88″ N), Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China. The deposition effect of the droplets, defoliation rate, and cotton boll opening rate were tested under different application dosages. The height of cotton plants was approximately 1 m. On the day of the test, the temperature was 13–27 °C and the wind force was ≤ 3.</p>
