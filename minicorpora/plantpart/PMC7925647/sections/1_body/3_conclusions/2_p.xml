<p id="Par37">We determined the optimal working conditions of the rotary atomizer and tested the atomization performance of the formulations using an indoor spraying device. The cumulative volume particle size of the ultra-low-volume spray was larger than that of the reference product, and the droplet size distribution was more uniform. In addition, droplet size increased with increase in viscosity while droplet size spectrum decreased with increase in viscosity, indicating that droplets with more uniform distribution can be obtained by increasing the viscosity of the formulation.</p>
