<p id="Par38">We examined the deposition effect of the formulation, as well as the defoliation rate and boll opening rate of cotton, in an efficacy trial. Droplet size, coverage rate, and deposition density increased with increased dosage. Under the same dosage, the droplet size of the ultra-low-volume spray was slightly larger than that of the reference product, and the coverage rate and deposition density were greater than those of the reference product. The ultra-low-volume spray at 9.00 L/ha showed the best defoliation effect at 15Â days after application, with a defoliation rate of 77.84% and boll opening rate of 100%. The defoliation rate of the reference product was 54.58%, and the boll opening rate was only 44.68%. Therefore, ultra-low-volume spray could be considered as an ideal pesticide formulation suitable for plant protection UAV. It had the characteristics of low dosage, high efficiency and environmentally friendly.</p>
