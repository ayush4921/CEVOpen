<p id="Par36">We prepared a thidiazuron·diuron ultra-low-volume spray that met the quality requirements of an ultra-low-volume spray. We evaluated the application of thidiazuron·diuron ultra-low-volume spray compared with the reference product, 54% tidiazuron·diuron suspension concentrate. The surface tension of the oil agent was lower, the initial contact angle and the static contact angle on cotton leaves were smaller, and the spreading speed was faster than those of the reference product, indicating that the oil agent had good wetting and spreading performance. At the same time, the volatilization rate of ultra-low-volume sprays was much lower than that of the reference product, which was beneficial to use in hot and dry areas such as Xinjiang.</p>
