0: Thidiazuron is a urea plant growth regulator that promotes the production of ethylene and abscisic acid in cotton and inhibits the transport of auxin.
1: A separation layer forms between the leaf and the petiole to promote leaf shedding 9,  10.
2: Combined use of thidiazuron and diuron produces better defoliation effects than thidiazuron alone, with diuron enhancing defoliation activity especially in low-temperature environments 11.
3: Ethylene is a gaseous hormone that promotes fruit ripening and shedding of old leaves and other organs 12,  13.
4: Defoliation of cotton plants is closely related to the ripening and opening of cotton bolls, and a combination of defoliant and ethephon improves the effect of defoliation.
5: Ethephon is a type of ethylene precursor; after being absorbed by cotton, it promotes the biosynthesis of ethylene, resulting in ripening and cracking of cotton bolls 14.
6: Therefore, chemical defoliation and ripening are essential for machine picking of cotton.
7: Defoliation stimulates cotton bolls to open relatively early and uniformly, reduces impurities in seed cotton, avoids pollution of cotton wool with dead leaf debris, and improves the quality and yield of cotton, thereby increasing the planting efficiency of cotton.
