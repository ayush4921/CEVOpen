0: Cotton is an important economic crop.
1: As the main raw material of the textile industry, it plays a crucial role in China's national economy 1  3.
2: Xinjiang is a prominent planting base for cotton in China.
3: For a long time, farmers relied on manual harvesting of cotton; however, the huge labor expenditure seriously reduced the income of the cotton farmers 4.
4: Therefore, machine-picking has become an inevitable choice for cotton harvesting because it reduces labor and planting costs 5.
5: However, application and popularization of mechanical picking in China is far from sufficient.
6: The main problem is that cotton bolls do not open uniformly at harvest time, and the leaves do not fall off completely, leading to a high content of impurities in mechanically picked cotton.
7: Therefore, spraying defoliant to make leaves fall off and promote earlier and uniform opening of cotton bolls is an important step in accelerating the process of mechanized cotton picking and improving the quality of cotton seeds 6  8.
