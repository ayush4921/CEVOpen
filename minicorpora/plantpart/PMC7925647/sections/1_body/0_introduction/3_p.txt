0: The method used for spraying defoliants plays an important role in the efficiency of cotton defoliation.
1: Defoliants are generally used during the boll-opening stage 15  17.
2: Improving the coverage of defoliants on cotton plants is key to improving the efficacy of defoliants.
3: Currently, cotton growers in Chinas Xinjiang region mainly use boom-type sprayers to spray pesticides.
4: Compared with knapsack sprayers, these have wide spray width, large capacity, and high efficiency, leading to savings in labor costs and time.
5: However, the terrain can restrict boom-type sprayers, which can damage plants, spraying can be uneven, and their efficacy is not excellent 18.
6: In addition, given the large application volumes, the effective utilization rate of pesticides is low, potentially causing pollution 19.
