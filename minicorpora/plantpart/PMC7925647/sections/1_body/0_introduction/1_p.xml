 </sup>. However, application and popularization of mechanical picking in China is far from sufficient. The main problem is that cotton bolls do not open uniformly at harvest time, and the leaves do not fall off completely, leading to a high content of impurities in mechanically picked cotton. Therefore, spraying defoliant to make leaves fall off and promote earlier and uniform opening of cotton bolls is an important step in accelerating the process of mechanized cotton picking and improving the quality of cotton seeds
