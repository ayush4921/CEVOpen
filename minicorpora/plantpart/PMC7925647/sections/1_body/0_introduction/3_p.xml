 </sup>. Improving the coverage of defoliants on cotton plants is key to improving the efficacy of defoliants. Currently, cotton growers in China’s Xinjiang region mainly use boom-type sprayers to spray pesticides. Compared with knapsack sprayers, these have wide spray width, large capacity, and high efficiency, leading to savings in labor costs and time. However, the terrain can restrict boom-type sprayers, which can damage plants, spraying can be uneven, and their efficacy is not excellent
