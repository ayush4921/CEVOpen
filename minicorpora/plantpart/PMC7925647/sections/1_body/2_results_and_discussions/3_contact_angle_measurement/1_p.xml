 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows the contact angle of different samples on cotton leaves and the change in contact angle over time. The contact angles of oil agents containing the adjuvant 992, AEO-7 and AEO-9 were smaller than that of the reference product, and the spreading effect was superior to that of the reference product. In the surface tension test, sample 5 had the smallest surface tension of 31.67 mN/m; this sample showed the minimum initial contact angle (39°) and a static contact angle (22°). The surface tension of the reference product was 38.90 mN/m., with the maximum initial contact angle (65.5°). Therefore, the relationship between surface tension and contact angle conformed to Young's equation.
