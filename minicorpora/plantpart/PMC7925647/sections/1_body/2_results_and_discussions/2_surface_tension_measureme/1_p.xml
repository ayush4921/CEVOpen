<p id="Par22">The critical surface tension of cotton leaves is 63.30–71.81 mN/m. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows that the surface tension of each sample was 31.67–33.37 mN/m, which was much lower than the critical surface tension of the leaf, indicating the agent was able to completely wet the leaf and be fully distributed on the leaf surface. The maximum surface tension of the reference product was 38.90 mN/m. Under the same dosage of adjuvant, sample 5 with adjuvant 992 had the smallest surface tension of 31.67 mN/m.
