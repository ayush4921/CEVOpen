<p id="Par31">We tested the efficacy of the ULV spray formulation by spraying cotton plants using an UAV. The test results in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref> indicate that increasing the dosage of application would increase droplet size, coverage, and deposition density. At the same application dosage, the droplet size of the ultra-low-volume spray was slightly larger than that of the reference product, and the coverage and deposition density were greater than those of the reference product. The droplet spectral width (Rs) of the five treatments was less than 1, and the coefficient of variation was less than 7%, indicating that the droplet distribution was relatively uniform. Among treatments, T2 had the narrowest Rs and coefficient of variation (CV), where the droplet size distribution was the most uniform. For the ultra-low-volume spray, at the application dosage of 4.5â€“9.0 L/ha, the droplet coverage gradually increased from 0.85 to 4.15%; the droplet deposition densities were 15.63, 17.24, 28.45, and 42.57 pcs/cm
 <sup>2</sup>, which were larger than requirements suggested in the literature. The droplet coverage of the reference product (T5) was 0.73%, and the deposition density was only 11.32 pcs/cm
 <sup>2</sup>.
