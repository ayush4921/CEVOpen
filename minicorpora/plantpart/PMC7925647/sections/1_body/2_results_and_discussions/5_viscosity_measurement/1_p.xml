 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> shows that the viscosity of the five oil agents ranged from 12.9 to 18.3 mPa s, meeting the quality requirements of an ultra-low-volume spray (&lt; 2 Pa s). The addition of chlorinated paraffin effectively increased the viscosity, facilitating analysis of the relationship between deposition and the viscosity of droplets in the subsequent experiment. This part of the work is described below under atomization performance.
