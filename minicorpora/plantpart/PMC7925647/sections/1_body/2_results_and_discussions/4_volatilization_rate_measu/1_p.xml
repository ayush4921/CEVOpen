<p id="Par24">As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, the volatilization rate of the oil agent was much lower than that of the reference product. The volatilization rate of the five treatments was 5.80–8.74%, while the volatilization rate of the reference product was 22.97%. The volatilization rate of the oil agent met the quality requirements of an ultra-low-volume spray (≤ 30%). A low volatilization rate helps with spraying defoliants in hot and dry areas such as Xinjiang, effectively preventing evaporation of the droplets and increasing deposition.
