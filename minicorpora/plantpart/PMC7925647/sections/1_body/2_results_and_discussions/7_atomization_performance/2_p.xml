 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>, droplet size increased with increasing viscosity, which influenced the droplet spectrum. The results in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref> show that the span of droplet size decreased with the increase of viscosity, indicating that droplets with more uniform distribution could be obtained by increasing the viscosity of the formulation
