<p id="Par21">The results of solvent screening are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The original pesticide could not be completely dissolved using a single solvent. However, 5% 
 <italic>N</italic>-methyl-2-pyrrolidone + 10% cyclohexanone could completely dissolve the original pesticide. There was no solid precipitation at room temperature, so the formulation could be used for the subsequent experiment. According to Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, a mixture of sulfonate adjuvants (70b) and fatty alcohol polyoxyethylene ether adjuvants (AEO-4, -5, -7, -9, 992) could stabilize the system in a single, transparent, homogeneous phase. Therefore, sulfonate adjuvant (70b) was selected and mixed with five adjuvants of the AEO series to prepare thidiazuron·diuron ultra-low-volume sprays, numbered 1–5 (as shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).
