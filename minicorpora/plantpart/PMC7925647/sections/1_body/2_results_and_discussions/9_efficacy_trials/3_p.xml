<p id="Par34">Application of the ultra-low-volume spray at 4.50 L/ha or 6.00 L/ha and the reference product at 6.00 L/ha had a poor defoliation effect. T4 (9.00 L/ha) was superior to the others, and the defoliation rate reached 77.84% 15 days after application. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>, the boll opening rates of the five treatments were 58.54%, 67.74%, 95.35%, 100%, and 44.68% 15 days after application. Similarly, the boll opening rates of T1, T2, and T5 were poor, with the boll opening rate of the control T5 only 44.68%. We analyzed significant differences between the defoliation rates and boll opening rates of the five treatments. The results showed that the defoliation rate and boll opening rate associated with the thidiazuron·diuron ultra-low-volume spray on cotton plants were significantly different from those of the reference product.
