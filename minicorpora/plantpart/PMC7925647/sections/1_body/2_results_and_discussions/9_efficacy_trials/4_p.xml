<p id="Par35">Overall, the defoliation rate and boll opening rate produced by the ultra-low-volume spray were superior to those produced by the reference product. This result was consistent with data shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>. The higher the droplet coverage rate, the higher the droplet deposition density and the higher the defoliation rate and boll opening rate. T1, T2 and T5 had poor deposition effect on cotton plants, and the effective pesticide utilization rate was low, resulting in dissatisfactory defoliation rates and boll opening rates. Both the droplet coverage rate and the droplet deposition density of T3 and T4 were large. Therefore, droplets of pesticide solution could deposit more easily and uniformly on cotton leaves, allowing the plants to defoliate and open their bolls easily.
