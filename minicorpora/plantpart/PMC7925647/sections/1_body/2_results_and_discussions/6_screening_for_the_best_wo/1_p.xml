<p id="Par26">As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, the linear equation fitted to voltage and rotation speed was y = 79.2418x + 400.2857, and the correlation coefficient was 0.9998. This indicated a good linear relationship and that the working state of the rotary atomizer was stable, and met the requirements of the next experiment.
