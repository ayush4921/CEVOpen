<p id="Par27">The relationship between droplet size and the rotation speed of the rotary atomizer are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>. The rotation speed of the rotary atomizer and the cumulative volume diameter had a binomial distribution. The equation fitted to D
 <sub>10</sub> was y = 1E−05x
 <sup>2</sup> − 0.2496x + 1440.4, with a correlation coefficient of 0.9947; the equation fitted to D
 <sub>50</sub> was y = 8E−06x
 <sup>2</sup> – 0.1672x + 934.73, with a correlation coefficient of 0.9791; the equation fitted to D
 <sub>90</sub> was y = 5E−06x
 <sup>2</sup> – 0.0983x + 539.55, with a correlation coefficient of 0.9005. The correlation between the cumulative volume diameter and the rotation speed was very high, and the cumulative volume diameter became smaller as the rotation speed increased. When the rotation speed exceeded 9600 rpm (voltage 20 V), the cumulative volume diameter hardly changed. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, when the rotation speed was 6400–7600 rpm (voltage 10–15 V), the spectral width of droplets increased with increasing rotation speed, and the distribution of droplets became more uneven. When the rotation speed was 7600–9600 rpm (voltage 15–20 V), the spectral width of droplets decreased with increasing rotation speed, and the distribution of droplets became more uniform. The minimum droplet size distribution appeared at 9600 rpm (voltage 15–20 V). When the rotation speed surpassed 9600 rpm (voltage &gt; 20 V), the droplet size distribution tended to be stable. This coincided with data shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, where the inflection point appeared when rotation speed was 9600 rpm (voltage = 20 V).
