<p>The reducing power of an essential oil can serve as a significant indicator of its potential antioxidant activity. For this reason, the reducing power of ferric ions and total polyphenols content were examined (
 <xref rid="metabolites-10-00414-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) of the essential oil in this study exhibited a weak reducing power compared to the values obtained in other works [

 <xref rid="B38-metabolites-10-00414" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and slightly less than those reported for wild oregano populations from Sicily, Italy [
 <xref rid="B39-metabolites-10-00414" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The lack of correlation between total polyphenol content and antioxidant capacity could be attributed to the fact that the Folin–Ciocalteu method reflects the presence of all reducing substances in a matrix, not just polyphenolics. Thus, the presence of non-phenolic substances cannot be ruled out. Therefore, interpretations of total phenolic content (TPC) results must consider these potential limitations. Despite these limitations, the TPC and antioxidant methods are widely used [
