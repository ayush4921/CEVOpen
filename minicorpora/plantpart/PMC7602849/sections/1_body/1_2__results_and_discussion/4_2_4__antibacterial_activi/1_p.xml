 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-10-00414-f002">Figure 2</xref>). This technique is recognized as a useful semi-quantitative method to determine the sensitivity of microorganisms to certain compounds. Disks impregnated in ethanol were used as a negative control. These disks were dried under the biosafety chamberâ€™s flow to evaporate the ethanol and avoid its antimicrobial effect. The essential oil showed inhibitory activity against these pathogens, with diameters between 7 and 16 mm, classified as moderate/mild inhibitory activity compared to those reported by other authors [
