 <xref rid="metabolites-10-00414-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. shows the inhibitory and bactericidal effects of oregano oil, tested on five species of bacteria of clinical importance (
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic>, 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>) and five species of plant-pathogenic bacteria (
 <italic>Erwinia rhapontici</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic>, 
 <italic>Pantoea agglomerans</italic>, 
 <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic>, and 
 <italic>Xanthomonas campestris</italic>). The different bacterial species tested showed varying susceptibility to the effects of the essential oil, which was expected since bacterial susceptibility to antimicrobial compounds is variable even at the strain level. This variation is due to specific differences in the composition of the different macromolecules and structures that these microorganisms possess. From 
 <xref rid="metabolites-10-00414-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, it can be observed that almost all microorganisms were susceptible to the action of oregano essential oil, with a variation in the MIC values from 0.04% 
 <italic>v/v</italic> to 0.63% 
 <italic>v/v</italic> and MBC values from 0.08% 
 <italic>v/v</italic> to 1.25% 
 <italic>v/v</italic>. 
 <italic>P. agglomerans</italic> and 
 <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> showed resistance to the antimicrobial activity, and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> presented the highest resistance (0.63% 
 <italic>v/v</italic> MIC and 1.25% 
 <italic>v/v</italic> MBC). Kanamycin (50 Âµg) was used as a positive control of bacterial inhibition. 
 <italic>E. rhapontici</italic> (0.04% 
 <italic>v/v</italic> MIC and 0.08% 
 <italic>v/v</italic> MBC) and 
 <italic>X. campestris</italic> (0.08% 
 <italic>v/v</italic> MIC and 0.08% 
 <italic>v/v</italic> MBC) were the most susceptible phytopathogenic bacteria to oregano oil, with the lowest concentrations necessary to inhibit bacterial growth. These results could indicate a potential use of this essential oil in agriculture and agribusiness [
 <xref rid="B43-metabolites-10-00414" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. On the other hand, among the bacteria of clinical importance, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>S. enterica</italic> (0.08% 
 <italic>v/v</italic> MIC and 0.08% 
 <italic>v/v</italic> MBC) were the most susceptible to oregano oil. These results represent a promising strategy for controlling common foodborne pathogens.
