<p>The antibacterial activity of oregano oil was determined by the method described by Klančnik et al., with modifications [
 <xref rid="B49-metabolites-10-00414" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. A stock solution of 10% (
 <italic>v/v</italic>) oregano oil in ethanol was prepared. An aliquot of 15 μL of the stock solution was impregnated on 5 mm sterile cellulose filter paper disks. The same procedure was repeated with disks impregnated only with ethanol, which were used as a negative control. The impregnated disks were dried under the biosafety chamber flow to evaporate ethanol and avoid its antimicrobial effect. Disks containing 50 μg kanamycin were used as a positive control of bacterial inhibition. Fresh inocula of each bacterial species were prepared as previously described, diluted to 0.5 of McFarland standard, and inoculated uniformly on plates containing nutrient broth supplemented with 12 g/L of agar. The dried and impregnated disks were arranged equidistant from each other. The plates were incubated for 24 h at 25 °C or 35 °C, as appropriate. Bacterial growth inhibition diameter was recorded after the incubation step, which is observed as a transparent halo without growth around each disk. The tests were carried out in triplicate.
