<p>The minimum concentration of oregano oil necessary to inhibit bacterial growth was carried out using the method described by Andrews [
 <xref rid="B50-metabolites-10-00414" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The final oregano oil concentrations used were 0 to 10% (
 <italic>v/v</italic>). The final working volume for each concentration was 200 µL. Each dilution was inoculated with the different bacteria to be tested in 96-well plates at 25 °C or 35 °C, as appropriate. As controls, nutrient broth without compound inoculated with each bacterium (growth control), and nutrient broth with 0–10% (
 <italic>v/v</italic>) of oregano oil without bacterial inoculation (negative control of growth and sterility of the compound) were used. An assay using 0–90% ethanol was performed to estimate the ethanol MIC of each bacterium. Concentrations higher than 20% ethanol were shown to be inhibitory for all bacteria. For this reason, a 40% (
 <italic>v/v</italic>) oregano oil was prepared as a stock solution to avoid the inhibitory effect of ethanol during MIC assays. After 24 h of incubation, we determined the lowest concentration of compound at which no bacterial growth was observed.
