<p>Aerial parts of 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> were collected cultivated in Socoroma (Putre, Chile) (18°15’4.67’’ S; 69°36’7.44’’ W, 2945 masl). The collection was carried out as described by Mechergui et al. [
 <xref rid="B13-metabolites-10-00414" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and Bisht et al. [
 <xref rid="B33-metabolites-10-00414" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], with some modifications. Each collection consisted of 20 plants at the bloom stage in November 2019 from four different estates in the same village. The samples were selected to provide a homogenous group based on harvest, color, size, and freshness according to visual analysis. This sample was identified and deposited in the Herbarium from the Botany Department of Universidad de Concepción, Chile (voucher specimen 184934). The essential oil was obtained from dry plant material (50 g) by hydrodistillation for 60 min using a modified Clevenger system. Subsequently, the essential oil was dried through anhydrous sodium sulfate, and the yield was 5.3% (
 <italic>v/d.w.)</italic> of the plants collected in 2019. The essential oil was stored at −20 °C.
