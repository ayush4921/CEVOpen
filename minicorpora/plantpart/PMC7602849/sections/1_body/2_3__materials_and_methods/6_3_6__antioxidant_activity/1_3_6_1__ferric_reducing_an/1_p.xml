<p>The determination of the ferric reducing antioxidant power or the ferric reducing capacity (FRAP test) was carried out as described by Parra et al. [
 <xref rid="B47-metabolites-10-00414" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], with some modifications. The FRAP reagent was prepared by mixing 25 mL of acetate buffer (300 mmol/L, pH 3.6), 2.5 mL of TPTZ solution (10 mmol/L) in hydrochloric acid (40 mmol/L), and 2.5 mL of FeCl
 <sub>3</sub>·6H
 <sub>2</sub>O (20 mmol/L). For measurement, 25 µL of diluted extract (0.5 g/L) was mixed with 175 µL of FRAP reagent in a 96-well microplate. The mixture was incubated for 40 min at 25 °C, and then absorption was recorded at 593 nm in a Synergy ™ HTX multimodal microplate reader (BioTek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT, USA). To quantify each solution’s antioxidant capacity, Trolox was used as standard and ethanol 80%
