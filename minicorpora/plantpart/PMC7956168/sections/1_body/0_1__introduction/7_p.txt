0: T. serrulatus has been reported to possess anthelmintic, antibacterial, fungicidal [ 23], diuretic [ 22], vasodilatory [ 24], and antihyperlipidemic [ 25] activities.
1: Further, the essential oil of  T. serrulatus (TSA oil) has been reported to possess antiseptic, antifungal, and vermifuge properties, among others [ 26].
2: The essential oil of the plant from different Ethiopian localities showed promising hepatoprotective activity in rats [ 27].
3: Additionally, previous studies have shown that the pharmacological activities of the essential oil are positively correlated with the presence of active ingredients such as thymol, carvacrol, p-cymene, -terpinene, and rosmarinic acid [ 26, 27].
4: On the other hand, thymol and carvacrol, which have been found as major constituents in essential oil, are important natural products with free radical scavenging activities and antioxidant properties [ 28].
5: A previous study reported that a combination of thymol and carvacrol had a synergistic nephroprotective effect that might be attributed to antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic activities [ 29].
6: Additionally, thymol and carvacrol, which have been found as major constituents in essential-oil-containing plants, also caused a decrease in the immunoglobulin E (IgE), interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-5 (IL-5), and interleukin-13 (IL-13) levels as well as the number of inflammatory cells that cause airway disorders [ 30].
