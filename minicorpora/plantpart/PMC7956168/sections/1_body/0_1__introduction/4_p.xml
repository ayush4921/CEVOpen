<p>Previous literature also finds that the correlation between oxidative stress and inflammation enhances various renal diseases [

Therefore, it can be suggested that renal toxicity is caused by Cd through complex intracellular signaling pathways which are mainly directed by oxidative stress. Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) controls several inflammatory genes in all types of cells [
