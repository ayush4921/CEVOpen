 <xref rid="B25-molecules-26-01252" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] activities. Further, the essential oil of 
 <italic>T. serrulatus</italic> (TSA oil) has been reported to possess antiseptic, antifungal, and vermifuge properties, among others [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-26-01252" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The essential oil of the plant from different Ethiopian localities showed promising hepatoprotective activity in rats [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-26-01252" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Additionally, previous studies have shown that the pharmacological activities of the essential oil are positively correlated with the presence of active ingredients such as thymol, carvacrol, p-cymene, Î³-terpinene, and rosmarinic acid [

 <xref rid="B27-molecules-26-01252" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. On the other hand, thymol and carvacrol, which have been found as major constituents in essential oil, are important natural products with free radical scavenging activities and antioxidant properties [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-26-01252" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. A previous study reported that a combination of thymol and carvacrol had a synergistic nephroprotective effect that might be attributed to antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic activities [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-26-01252" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Additionally, thymol and carvacrol, which have been found as major constituents in essential-oil-containing plants, also caused a decrease in the immunoglobulin E (IgE), interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-5 (IL-5), and interleukin-13 (IL-13) levels as well as the number of inflammatory cells that cause airway disorders [
