0: The kidneys are vital organs in the human body and responsible for various essential functions, including the removal of harmful metabolites, nitrogenous wastes, and some drugs with urine [ 4].
1: Earlier studies reported that Cd toxicity results in irreversible dysfunction of renal tubules [ 5] and causes decreased removal of the toxic chemicals, drugs, or both that lead to acute kidney failure.
2: Moreover, renal injury caused by chronic Cd exposure may lead to chronic kidney failure and if not treated can result in death [ 6, 7].
3: Cd accumulation in proximal convoluted tubules obstructs tubular reabsorption and results in polyuria and proteinuria.
4: There have been studies of common abnormal effects of Cd on kidney function, but there is still a lack of detailed information on molecular mechanisms and a need to explore this further [ 8].
