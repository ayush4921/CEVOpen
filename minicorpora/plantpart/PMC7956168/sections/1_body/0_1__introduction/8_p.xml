<p>As far as we know, the effect of 
 <italic>T. serrulatus</italic> on nephrotoxicity has not been reported. Thus, in this study, we hypothesized and attempted to investigate the nephroprotective effect of the essential oil extracted from 
 <italic>T. serrulatus</italic> of Ethiopian origin against Cd-induced nephrotoxicity using Wistar albino rats by evaluating kidney function markers, inflammatory markers, antioxidant status, and histological changes.
