<p>Apoptosis occurs in tissues and varies from necrosis under certain functional disorders [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-26-01252" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Apoptosis is one of the principal characteristics of Cd-related kidney injury. Earlier, it was described that Cd toxicity causes apoptosis in proximal tubules through stimulation of the NF-kB pathway, which contributes to renal dysfunction [

 <xref rid="B48-molecules-26-01252" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In this study also, an increased NF-kBp65 protein expression was observed in Cd-treated rats. However, administration of TSA oil in Cd-treated rats substantially restored the NF-kBp65 protein expression. The observed findings are in agreement with the previous findings [
