<p>Previous literature reported that Cd is one of the most toxic heavy metals and is mainly absorbed by the proximal tubules and accumulated mostly in the renal cortex, which leads to lesions in proximal convoluted tubules [

 <xref rid="B51-molecules-26-01252" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], who reported atrophy of glomerular capillaries and necrosis of proximal tubules. The findings of kidney function markers and oxidative stress markers—where TSA oil ameliorated Cd-induced degenerative changes and improved kidney function owing to its possible antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects—have been confirmed by histopathological observations.
