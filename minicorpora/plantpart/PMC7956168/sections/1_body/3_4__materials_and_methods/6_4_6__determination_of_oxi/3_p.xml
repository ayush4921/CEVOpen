<p>For GSH, the Jollow et al. [
 <xref rid="B54-molecules-26-01252" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] method was followed. Briefly, after precipitation of 1 mL PMS with 1 mL of sulfosalicylic acid (4%), the test samples were incubated (4 °C, 1 h), followed by centrifugation (1200× 
 <italic>g</italic>, 15 min, 4 °C). The assay mixture contained supernatant (0.1 mL), phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.4) (1.7 mL), and dithio-bis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB) (0.4% in phosphate buffer, 0.1 M, pH 7.4) (0.2 mL) in a total volume of 2.0 mL. The absorbance of samples was analyzed at 412 nm within 5 min after the addition of DTNB to the reaction mixtures.
