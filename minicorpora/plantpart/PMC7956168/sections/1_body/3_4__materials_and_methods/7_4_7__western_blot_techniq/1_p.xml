<p>Western blot analysis and protein extraction were performed as mentioned in the previous study [
 <xref rid="B55-molecules-26-01252" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Kidney tissues were minced and the homogenate was prepared in a protease inhibitor mixture and cold protein lysis buffer [
 <xref rid="B55-molecules-26-01252" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. To isolate the total proteins, the tissue lysates were preserved in ice for 60 min, with alternative vortexing (after 10 min), continued with the centrifugation at 12,000× 
 <italic>g</italic> (4 °C, 10 min). The method of Lowry et al. [
 <xref rid="B56-molecules-26-01252" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] was followed to determine the total protein. For Western blot analysis, protein (25–50 µg) was briefly isolated from each group and shifted to nitrocellulose membranes obtained from Bio-Rad USA. Immediately blocking of protein blots was done at 4 °C (for 24 h); after that, incubation with primary antibodies against NF-κB p65, iNOS, and Smad2 and peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies at room temperature was performed. The proteins were analyzed with the help of a chemiluminescence detection kit (GE Health Care, Mississauga, Canada). Protein band intensity was normalized to beta-actin bands using the ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, USA). Images were captured with a C-Digit chemiluminescent Western blot scanner obtained from LI-COR, USA.
