<p>After 24 h of treatment, all the male rats were anesthetized with a small amount of diethyl ether to collect the blood samples from retro-orbital plexus followed by centrifugation, and the separation of serum was performed and stored at −20 °C until further use for the determination of kidney function markers (like uric acid, creatinine, and urea). After successful serum collection, both the kidneys were isolated from all the rats. The left kidney was immediately stored at −80 °C until the further analysis of oxidative stress markers (MDA and GSH) and Western blot analysis. Meanwhile, the right kidney was stored for histopathological studies.</p>
