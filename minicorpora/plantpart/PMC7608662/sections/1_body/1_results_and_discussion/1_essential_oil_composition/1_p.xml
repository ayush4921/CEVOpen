<p id="Par8">Prior to this study, several essential oils from 
 <italic>T. albicans</italic> plants collected in different regions of Algarve (Portugal) were chemically characterized, revealing chemical variability regarding the four major compounds 1,8-cineole (29–43%), linalool (5–25%), α-terpineol (4.5–9.8%) and borneol (2.2–8.0%). The most predominant chemical profile was characterized by high contents of 1,8-cineole and linalool. Therefore, for the present study we selected the sample that better represented the chemical profile of the essential oils from Portuguese 
 <italic>T. albicans</italic>. This sample was obtained from populations with the same chemical profile growing in Foz de Almargem coastal lagoon in Algarve. The chemical characterization of the obtained essential oil is shown in Table
