<p id="Par25">At 0.64 μL/mL, 
 <italic>T. albicans</italic> essential oil inhibited by 13.64% iNOS expression in comparison to the LPS stimulus (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). This slight decrease of iNOS protein levels in LPS-stimulated macrophages pre-treated with 
 <italic>T. albicans</italic> essential oil does not reflect the significant NO reduction evaluated through Griess reaction. It seems that 
 <italic>T. albicans</italic> essential oil may exert its anti-inflammatory activity also by modulating iNOS activity or by inhibiting other signaling pathways. Further studies should be performed to deeply explore this hypothesis. Regarding COX-2 levels, no significant result was observed, indicating a selective effect of the oil towards iNOS expression (Fig.
