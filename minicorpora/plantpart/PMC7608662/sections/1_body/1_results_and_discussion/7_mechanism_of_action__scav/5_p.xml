 </sup> also showed the anti-inflammatory activity of linalool using in vitro and in vivo models. Linalool inhibited NF-kB and MAPK activation in LPS-stimulated macrophages and protected mice against LPS-induced acute lung injury by reducing the production of TNF-α and IL-6. Borneol was shown to decrease the expression of cytokines (IL-6 and IL-8) in human gingival fibroblasts
