<p id="Par40">The effect of the 
 <italic>T. albicans</italic> essential oil on the disruption of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> ATCC 10231 preformed biofilm was investigated following the method described by Alves-Silva et al.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>
 </sup>. Briefly, a cell suspension of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> was prepared in Yeast Peptone Dextrose (YPD) broth (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% dextrose) and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. A final suspension of 1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU/mL was added to 96-well microtiter plates and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C, to form the biofilms. After three washing steps with PBS, the essential oils (0.16–2.5 µL/mL) prepared in RPMI were added and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. Negative and positive controls were included using sterile and inoculated RPMI media, respectively.
