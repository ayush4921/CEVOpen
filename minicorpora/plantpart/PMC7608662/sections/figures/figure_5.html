 <caption> NO scavenging potential of Thymus albicans essential oil . Different concentrations of essential oil (0.08–1.25 μL/mL) were incubated with SNAP (300 μM) in culture medium for 3 h. Results are expressed as a percentage of NO release triggered by SNAP. Each value represents the mean ± SEM of three independent assays, performed in duplicate. Statistical differences were calculated by one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s post hoc test (### p &lt; 0.001, compared to control). </caption>
