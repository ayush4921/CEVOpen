 <caption> Effect of Thymus albicans essential oil on macrophages viability ( A) and nitrites production ( B). Cell viability is expressed as a percentage of MTT reduction in comparison to control cells (100% viability). Nitrite production is expressed as a percentage of nitrite production in comparison to cells stimulated with LPS alone (100% nitrite production). Each value represents the mean ± SEM from three experiments, performed in duplicate. Statistical differences between groups were calculated by one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s post hoc test (### p &lt; 0.001, compared to control ( B); ** p &lt; 0.01, *** p &lt; 0.001 compared to control ( A) and to LPS ( B)). </caption>
