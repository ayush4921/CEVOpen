<p>The pH of TVH was 3.90±0.01, which was less than the pH of 
 <italic>Ceratonia siliqua</italic> honey samples (range from 4.17 to 5.05) collected from Morocco [
 <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Furthermore, it was less than the pH of TVH collected from other different areas in Morocco; Rachidia 4.51±0.02, Saouira 4.04±0.03, and Zaraphyt 4.36±0.02 [
 <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. It means that TVH collected from Fez, boulemane, was more acidic. However, the pH value was within the range of pH of French honey (3.46-6.48), Uruguayan honey (3.0-4.3), Portuguese honey (3.98-5.05), and Iranian honey (3.62-6.61) [
