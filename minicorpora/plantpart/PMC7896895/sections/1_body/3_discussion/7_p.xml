<p>The mineral content is an essential part of the nutritional values of honey. The results showed that TVH contains necessary minerals that involve in several vital functions of the animals and the human body. It was found that potassium was the most abundant element in the thyme honey. The range of potassium concentration in TVH is almost within the range obtained in other honey types collected from different countries [
