<p>CCl
 <sub>4</sub> significantly increased the blood level of creatinine and urea. The mechanism of CCl
 <sub>4</sub> induced renal toxicity is almost the same as that of the liver. Furthermore, CCl
 <sub>4</sub> has a strong affinity to the kidney cortex because it contains a high level of cytochrome P-450 [

 <sub>4</sub> causes a significant elevation of oxidative stress markers in the blood and kidney tissues, which were markedly alleviated by Carob honeyâ€™s administration (Unpublished).
