<p>The ash content and electrical conductivity correlated with the mineral content of honey [
 <xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The ash content was 0.24Â±0.01%, which is following the standards of ash content in honey used in the EU (ash percentage of honey &lt;0.6%). Furthermore, the ash content of TVH lies in the range of Iranian honey samples (0.041-0.562%) and Indian honey samples (0.03-0.43%) [
