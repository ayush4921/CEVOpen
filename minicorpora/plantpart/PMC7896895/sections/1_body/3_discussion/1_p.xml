<p>The data presented here demonstrated for the first time the presence of epicatechin gallate in Moroccan TVH and the protective effect of TVH, OVEO, and their combination against CCl
 <sub>4</sub> induced liver and kidney damage. TVH was more potent than OVOE to protect against CCl
 <sub>4</sub> toxicity, and HEM was more potent than TVH and OVOE individually.
