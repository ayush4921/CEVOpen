<p>TVH has a high content of epicatechin galatte and ferulic acid, while OVOE contains carvacrol and thymol. Epicatechin gallate has anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and wound healing properties [

 <xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Ferulic acid effectively reduced lipid disorders in the plasma, liver, and kidney of CCl
 <sub>4</sub>-treated rats [

 <italic>O. vulgare</italic>, 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic>, and other plants. A recent review showed that carvacrol has antioxidants, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory activity [
