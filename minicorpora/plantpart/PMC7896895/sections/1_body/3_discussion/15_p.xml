<p>The GC/MS analysis of OVOE revealed two major compounds: Carvacrol (48.38%) and thymol (26.55%), which agrees with another study [
 <xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Furthermore, the compounds demonstrated in the OVOE were similar to 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> from Morocco and other countries, which showed that the major compound was carvacrol [
 <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The percentage of carvacrol and thymol in the OVOE sample is twice as high as those identified in OVOE from other Morocco areas [
 <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The difference might be related to the method of isolation, geographic origin, and season of harvesting [
 <xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. It has been reported that 37 compounds were identified in the leaf-flower oils and included carvacrol (30.73%), thymol (18.81%), P-cymene (10.88%), caryophyllene (7.73%), and 3-carene (4.06%) [
 <xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Therefore, carvacrol and thymol contents were less than those found in the present study. In another study, seven components were identified in OVEO; a-thujene, myrcene, a-terpinene, o-cymene, Î³-terpinene, thymol, and carvacrol; thymol content was 45%, and carvacrol content was 37.4% [
