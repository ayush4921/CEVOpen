<p>The honey moisture content is an important criterion to determine the quality of honey. The water content depends on nectar, storage and environmental conditions, and harvest season. TVH moisture was 16.4±0.01%, and it was within the range of Iranian honey moisture (13.97-17%), Portuguese honey moisture (13.1 and 16.9), and within limits (≤20%) set by the EU [
