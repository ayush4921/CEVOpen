<p>The value of phenol content in TVH was 74.05Â±1.21 mg GAE/100 g. It was found that phenol content of 17 commercial honey samples from Morocco varied from 16.38 mg GAE/100g in citrus honey to 92.37 mg GAE/100 in thyme honey from Rachidia [
 <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Therefore, the phenol content in TVH was less than that in thyme honey collected from Rachidia, Morocco. Iranian honey showed higher total phenol content (ranged between 193.8 mg GAE/100 g and 3020 mg GAE/100 g) than TVH [
 <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The total phenolic content of honey samples collected from Greek ranged from 55 to 92 mg GAE/100 g, and Manuka honey had a phenolic content (71 mg GAE/100g) [

 <xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Therefore, the phenolic content of TVH lies within the range of Jordanian honey and Greek honey samples, and it is almost similar to Manuka honey.
