<p>With the use of HPLC, the standard compounds were detected at 280 nm because most of the phenolic compounds showed reasonably high absorbance at this value. Five phenolic compounds were identified in TVH extract: Ferulic acid, gallic acid, caffeic acid, epicatechin gallate, and pyrogallol. The major constituent in the sample was epicatechin gallate, with a concentration of 6.91Â±0.05 mg/100 g. Ferulic acid, gallic acid, and caffeic acid have been reported in Malaysian honey [

Thyme honeys contains various compounds such as phenylacetaldehyde, 1-phenyl-2,3-butanedione, 3-hydroxy-4-phenyl-2-butanone, 3-hydroxy-1-phenyl-2-butanone, phenylacetonitrile, and carvacrol [

In another study, six phenolic acids (gallic, syringic, benzoic, trans-cinnamic, p-coumaric, and caffeic acids) and five flavonoids (catechin, kaempferol, naringenin, luteolin, and apigenin) were identified in Malaysian Tualang, Gelam, and Borneo tropical honey [
