<p>The results showed that CCl
 <sub>4</sub> significantly increases serum levels of AST, ALT, and ALP compared to the control group. However, administration of TVH, OVEO, or their combination to the animals with CCl
 <sub>4</sub>-induced hepatotoxicity decreased significantly liver enzymes compared to the CCl
 <sub>4</sub> treated group. This finding showed the hepatoprotective effect of TVH, OVOE, and HEM. Interestingly, HEM showed a more profound hepatoprotective effect than TVH or OVEO. The potentiation of HEM effect might be due to the synergistic activity of natural ingredients in TVH and OVEO. It was found that 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> leaf extract has significant protection against CCl
 <sub>4</sub>-induced hepatotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner. It lowered serum ALT, ALP, and AST levels and elevated Glutathione S-transferase, catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and GSH levels in liver tissue [

 <sub>4</sub> intoxication by normalizing liver enzymes and kidney function [
