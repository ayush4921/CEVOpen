<p>The total antioxidant capacity of TVH was 163.51±8.55 mg Eq AA/g. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of thyme honey from Rachidia, Morocco, were 52.85±1.2 mg/mL, and from Saouira, Morocco, were 51.76±1.26 mg/mL [
 <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This means that the DPPH scavenging activity of THV was higher than that of thyme honey collected in different areas of Morocco. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 21 different types of honey, which were derived from the Olympus mountain area, Greek, ranged from 7.5 to 109.0 mg/mL, while Manuka honey exhibited a weak antioxidant activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub>; 68.0 mg/mL) in DPPH assay [
 <xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Therefore, TVH was more potent than Manuka honey as an antioxidant and more than most Greek honey. IC
 <sub>50</sub> of Malaysian Tualang, Gelam, and Borneo tropical honey ranged between 5.24±0.40 and 17.51±0.51 mg/mL, and therefore, the antioxidant activity of TVH lies in the same range [
 <xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Jordanian honey collected in summer from Umm Alyanabea location has IC
 <sub>50</sub>=24.5 mg/mL, which is weaker than TVH as an antioxidant. The use of DPPH to evaluate the antioxidant activity is based on determining the ability of TVH to act as a hydrogen or electron donor in the conversion of DPPH in its reduced form (DPPH-H).
