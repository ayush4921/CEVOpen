<p>CCl
 <sub>4</sub> significantly increased TG levels, cholesterol, and LDL and decreased serum levels of HDL compared to the control group. TVH, OVEO, and HEM markedly ameliorated these effects. This finding agrees with the impact of Sidr honey on lipid profile in CCl
 <sub>4</sub> toxicity [
 <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In CCl
 <sub>4</sub>-untreated rats, TVH or OVEO has no significant effect on lipid profile; however, their combination caused a considerably lower TC, LDL, and VLDL and considerable HDL elevation. This result is most likely due to an additive or synergistic effect of active ingredients in TVH and OVEO. This finding makes their combination a good candidate for prophylaxis of dyslipidemia and cardiovascular diseases.
