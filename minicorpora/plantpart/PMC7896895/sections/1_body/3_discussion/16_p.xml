<p>The IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of OVEO prepared from the aerial part (stem and leaves) of the plant was 0.30±0.02 mg/mL. It is almost similar to the results of the IC50 values of the Chinese OVEO prepared from leaves/flower (0.332±0.040 mg/mL) and the plant root ( 0.357±0.031 mg/mL), but less than IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of essential oil prepared from the plant stem (0.501±0.029 mg/mL) [
 <xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. It was found that IC
 <sub>50</sub> of OVEO ranged from 0.32 mg/mL to 0.76 mg/mL, depending on incubation time [
 <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, the IC50 value of OVEO was less than that of TVH (10.85±0.02 mg/mL), which means that the DPPH scavenging activity of OVEO was higher than that of TVH.
