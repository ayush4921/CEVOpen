<p>The total antioxidant capacity of TVH was 163.51±8.55 mg Eq AA/g. The IC50 value of BHT was 0.009±0.0001 mg/mL in the DPPH assay. However, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> amount of OVEO was 0.30±0.02 mg/mL and of TVH was 10.85±0.02, which means that the DPPH scavenging activity of OVEO was higher than that of TVH (p&lt;0.05).
