<p>The effect of TVH, OVOE, and HEM on kidney and liver function and lipid profile in CCl
 <sub>4</sub>-untreated rats is demonstrated in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table-2</xref>. TVH decreased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (p&lt;0.05) significantly. TVH and OVEO did not cause significant changes in the total protein, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, lipid parameters, kidney function, and potassium and calcium level. However, OVEO caused a significant elevation of sodium level compared to the control group (p&lt;0.05). HEM caused a significant lowering of AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase (AP), and significantly increased total protein compared to the control group (p&lt;0.05). Regarding the renal function and electrolytes, TVH, OVEO, and HEM did not cause significant changes in blood urea, creatinine, sodium, potassium, and calcium. Lipid assay showed that HEM lowered total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoproteins (LDL), and very LDL (VLDL) and elevated high-density lipoprotein (HDL) compared to the control; the changes in TC level were significant (p&lt;0.05).
