<p>TVH was more potent than OVOE, and HEM was more potent than TVH and OVOE (p&lt;0.05). Lipid assays revealed that CCl
 <sub>4</sub> significantly increased all the lipid parameters and decreased HDL significantly. However, TVH, OVOE, and HEM significantly lowered the elevated lipid parameters as well as elevated the lowered HDL. TVH was more potent than OVOE, and HEM was more potent than TVH and OVOE (p&lt;0.05).
