<p>In CCl
 <sub>4</sub>-treated rats, CCl
 <sub>4</sub> caused a significant elevation of AST, ALT, AP, and total and direct bilirubin, and caused a significant lowering of total protein (p&lt;0.05) (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table-3</xref>). TVH, OVOE, and HEM significantly ameliorated these changes. TVH was more potent than OVEO, and HEM was more potent than TVH and OVEO individually (p&lt;0.05). Regarding kidney function and serum electrolytes, CCl
 <sub>4</sub> significantly elevated blood urea, creatinine, sodium, potassium, and calcium, while TVH, OVOE, and HEM significantly decreased all these parameters.
