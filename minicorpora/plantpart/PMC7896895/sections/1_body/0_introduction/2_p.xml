<p>CCl
 <sub>4</sub> is very toxic to the liver and kidney and used experimentally to induce liver and kidney damage. Others and we have found that honey has a protective effect against CCl
 <sub>4</sub>-induced liver and kidney toxicity [

 <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Furthermore, honey increases urine output and creatinine clearance, and it has protection against lead-induced kidney and liver toxicity [

 <sub>4</sub>-induced hepatotoxicity in rats has been reported [

 <sub>4</sub>-induced liver and kidney toxicity. Therefore, the present study examined the protective effect of TVH, OVOE, and their combination (HEM) against CCl
 <sub>4</sub>-induced toxicity in rats. It was well known that the chemical composition of various honey samples is different [
 <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Therefore, the authors designed the study to identify the chemical components and antioxidant activity of OVEO and TVH collected in Morocco.
