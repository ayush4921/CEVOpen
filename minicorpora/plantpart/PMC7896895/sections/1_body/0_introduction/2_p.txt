0: CCl 4 is very toxic to the liver and kidney and used experimentally to induce liver and kidney damage.
1: Others and we have found that honey has a protective effect against CCl 4-induced liver and kidney toxicity [ 8- 10].
2: Furthermore, honey increases urine output and creatinine clearance, and it has protection against lead-induced kidney and liver toxicity [ 11, 12].
3: The hepatoprotective activity of  O. vulgare leaves extract against CCl 4-induced hepatotoxicity in rats has been reported [ 13].
4: However, no study investigated the effect of TVH or OVEO on CCl 4-induced liver and kidney toxicity.
5: Therefore, the present study examined the protective effect of TVH, OVOE, and their combination (HEM) against CCl 4-induced toxicity in rats.
6: It was well known that the chemical composition of various honey samples is different [ 14, 15].
7: Therefore, the authors designed the study to identify the chemical components and antioxidant activity of OVEO and TVH collected in Morocco.
