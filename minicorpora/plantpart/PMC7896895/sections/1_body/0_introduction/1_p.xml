 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> honey (TVH) and 
 <italic>Origanum vulgar</italic> essential oil (OVEO) have important biological activities and have great potential to be introduced in the illness treatment.

The kidney and liver are vital organs with a wide range of biological functions that include metabolism, transforming, transport, and clearance of toxic substances. Furthermore, the kidney affects blood electrolytes, bone metabolism, and bone marrow function, and the liver is involved in lipid metabolism. Carbon tetrachloride (CCl
 <sub>4</sub>) is a volatile organic alkyl halogen, which is metabolized in the liver and generates trichloromethyl (CCl
 <sub>3</sub>) and trichloromethyl peroxyl (CCl
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>).
