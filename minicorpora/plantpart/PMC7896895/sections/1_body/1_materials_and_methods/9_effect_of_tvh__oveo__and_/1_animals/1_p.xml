<p>Forty-five adult male Wister rats (221±22 g) were used. The animals were kept in a diffusely lit and temperature-controlled room with a diurnal 12 h light cycle, where the temperature (25±1°C) and relative humidity (55±5%) were kept constant. The animals were given free access to a standard laboratory diet and water before the experiments.</p>
