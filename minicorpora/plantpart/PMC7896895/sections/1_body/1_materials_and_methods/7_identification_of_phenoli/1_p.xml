<p>The honey sample was subjected to base hydrolysis and extracted with ethyl acetate (liquid-liquid extraction) described by Aljadi and Yousoff [
 <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In brief, 10 g of honey were dissolved in acidified distal water, and the phenolic compounds were extracted with the use of ethyl acetate. The phenolic extract was passed in the rotavapor to remove the solvent, and then the dry phenolic extract was dissolved in 5 mL of methanol grade HPLC. With the use of HPLC, the analyses were carried out at 280 nm for phenolic compounds and operated at 30°C using a C18 column (4.6 mm×150 mm)×5 mm in a thermal fisher apparatus. The injected volume was 20 mL. Pure compounds that were used as standards included caffeic acid, gallic acid, epicatechin gallate, coumaric acid, rosmarinic acid, ferulic acid, syringic acid, tannic acid, and pyrogallol. All the standards were dissolved in methanol and injected under the same chromatographic conditions as the honey extracts. Phenolic compounds of honey were identified by comparing their retention times with those of pure standards. The results were obtained in mg/100 g of honey.
