<p>The antioxidant activity of TVH and OVEO was determined with the use of 1,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity according to the method by Brand-Williams 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Briefly, the ethanol solution of DPPH solution was added to dilution series of TVH and OVEO ranging from 15 to 500 for TVH and 0.8 to 100 mg/mL for OVEO and then incubated in the dark for 1 h. The absorbance was measured at 517 nm. The experiment was performed in triplicates, and average absorption was recorded for each concentration. Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) was used as a standard. The percent inhibition of the DPPH radical by the samples was calculated based on the following formula:
