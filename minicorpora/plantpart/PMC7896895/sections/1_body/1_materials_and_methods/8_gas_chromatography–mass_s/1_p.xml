<p>Regarding GC/MS analysis, the OVOE sample was diluted in hexane with a dilution of 10:100. The analysis of volatile constituents was completed using GC/MS method (GC ULTRA S/N 20062969; Polaris QS/N 210729), equipped with an HP-5MS column nonpolar fused silica (60 m×0.32 mm, 0.25 mm thickness). The temperature of the injector was 250°C. The column temperature was programmed from 40 to 260°C at 2°C/min. The carrier gas was helium, the flow rate was 1 mL/min, and the volume of sample injected was 1 μL of diluted oil. The identification of the components has been made by determination of their indices of retention Kovats index (Ki) compared to a Ki of a series of n-alkanes (C8-C20) and by comparing their mass spectra recorded with those stored in the database of the spectrometer (NIST MS Library v. 2.0, US Department of Commerce, California, USA), and the literature [
