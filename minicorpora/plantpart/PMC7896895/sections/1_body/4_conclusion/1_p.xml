<p>The main finding of this study is summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure-2</xref>. Interestingly, the data showed for the first time that TVH contains a high level of epicatechine galatte, which makes it a marker for TVH. The analysis of the OVEO confirms the presence of two major compounds: carvacrol and thymol. HVT and OVEO exhibited a strong antioxidant activity and have a high capacity to scavenge the free-radical DPPH. Furthermore, TVH, OVEO, and HEM showed a significant protective effect against CCl
 <sub>4</sub>-induced liver and kidney damage, electrolyte disturbances, and lipid disorder. Although the ability of OVEO to scavenger DPPH was higher than TVH; TVH was more potent than OVEO to protect against CCl
 <sub>4</sub> toxicity. Therefore, TVH, OVEO, and HEM are significant interventions to protect against chemical toxicity and might be useful in other causes of kidney and liver failure and dyslipidemia. While TVH and OVEO did not significantly affect kidney and liver function in CCl
 <sub>4</sub> non-treated rats, their combination causes a substantial improvement in lipid profile and kidney and liver function. Therefore, the use of HEM in normal individuals might improve the lipid profile and liver and kidney function and protect against cardiovascular disease. These findings are exciting and will stimulate further preclinical and clinical studies in this growing field.
