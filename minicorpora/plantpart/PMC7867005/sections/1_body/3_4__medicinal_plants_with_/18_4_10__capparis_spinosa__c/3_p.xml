<p>The antihyperglycemic effects of 
 <italic>C. spinosa</italic> are due to its inhibition of 
 <italic>Î±</italic>-amylase activity, the reduction in the mRNA expressions, and thew activities of PEPCK (Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase) and G6Pase (Glucose 6-phosphatase) that cause a reduction in basal endogenous glucose production by the liver, the stimulation of intracellular insulin signaling pathways and the enhancing of glucose uptake in the liver, muscle, and adipose tissue, causing an improvement in insulin sensitivity in these tissues [
