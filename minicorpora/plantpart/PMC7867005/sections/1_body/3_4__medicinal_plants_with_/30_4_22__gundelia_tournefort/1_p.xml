<p>The aqueous root, shoot, and aerial part extracts all demonstrated a significant hypoglycemic effect in diabetic mice. The possible mechanisms of antidiabetic activity include improving the pancreas, increasing the number and average diameter of the islets of Langerhans, increasing the secretion of insulin from the pancreas, increasing the insulin sensitivity, activating the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) that regulates the transcription of the gene involved in lipid and glucose homeostasis and metabolism within the cell, decreasing the glucose absorption from the intestine through decreasing the processes of glucose transport or the inhibition of
