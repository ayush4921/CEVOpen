<p>The antidiabetic activity was reported for extracts of different parts of

 <xref rid="B257-molecules-26-00742" ref-type="bibr">257</xref>]. The administration of 1 g/L of 
 <italic>S. nigrum</italic> fruit extract with the drinking water of diabetic animals decreased blood glucose levels. It was suggested that the plant can repair pancreatic
