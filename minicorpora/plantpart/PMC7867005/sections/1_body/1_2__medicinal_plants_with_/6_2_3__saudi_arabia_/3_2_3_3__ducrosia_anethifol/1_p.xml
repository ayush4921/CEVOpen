<p>The ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>D. anethifolia</italic> and its major isolated furanocoumarins demonstrated in vitro inhibitory effects against carbohydrate metabolizing enzymes, 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase, 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase, and 
 <italic>β</italic>-galactosidase in a concentration-dependent manner [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-26-00742" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The most potent inhibitors were imperatorin and 5-methoxypsoralen, while psoralen, oxypeucedanin hydrate, and isooxypeucedanin were moderated inhibitors [

 <italic>D. anethifolia</italic> ethanol extract showed a hypoglycemic effect that may be related to potentiating the pancreatic secretion of insulin from islet 
 <italic>β</italic>-cells, or the transport of blood glucose to the peripheral tissue, or antioxidant activity in several areas [
