<p>An earlier study compared the effects of an aqueous extract and stem/fruit skin blend prepared from 
 <italic>O. indica</italic> on normoglycemic male Wistar rats. The blood glucose-lowering effect and plasma insulin-increasing effect of the aqueous extract was obvious and statistically significant, but less so than the effect of glyburide. After 15 and 30 min, the optimum effects of increasing plasma insulin and lowering blood glucose were observed, respectively, from a dose of 5.88 mg/kg. On the other hand, the proprietary blend did not affect basal glucose levels in a dose of 6 mg/kg over a period of 180 min, but exhibited a stimulation effect on basal plasma insulin secretion, pointing to its direct action on
