<p>Previously, 
 <italic>M. peregrina</italic> was reported to have hypoglycemic properties. The antidiabetic activity was reported for the hydroalcoholic extract fraction of 
 <italic>M. peregrina</italic> seeds and aerial parts in streptozocin diabetic rats [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-26-00742" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Both extracts significantly decreased blood glucose levels comparably to the oral antidiabetic reference drug gliclazide. On the other hand, the 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane fraction was the only one that showed a highly significant antihyperglycemic activity that was attributed to the lupeol acetate and 
 <italic>Î²</italic>-sitosterol effect [
