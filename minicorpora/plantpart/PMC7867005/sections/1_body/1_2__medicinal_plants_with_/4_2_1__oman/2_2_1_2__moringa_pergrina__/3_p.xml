<p>The hydroalcoholic extract of 
 <italic>M. peregrina</italic> leaves showed inhibitory potential against three in vitro model enzyme assays: 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase, 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase, and dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV). The results for pancreatic 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase suggested that the enzyme responded to the extract when the concentration was increased, moderated intestinal 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase inhibitory potential, and caused a gradual inhibition of the activity of mammalian DPP IV enzyme [
