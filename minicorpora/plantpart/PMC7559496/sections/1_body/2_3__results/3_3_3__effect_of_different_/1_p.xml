<p>The changes in T level of golden hamsters are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(a)</xref>. Compared with the MG, the content of T in each intervention group showed a certain degree of reduction. However, only the bergamot essential oil groups significantly reduced the T level in comparison with MG (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Besides, all intervention groups increased the E
 <sub>2</sub> content compared with MG (shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(b)</xref>). But only HOO and HBJ could remarkably increase the E
 <sub>2</sub> content compared with MG (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). These results did not show a statistical difference between the sweet orange groups. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(c)</xref>, data showed that each intervention group lowered the ratio of T/E
 <sub>2</sub> in comparison with MG. Among them, the ratio of T/E
 <sub>2</sub> in high-dose intervention groups was significantly decreased in comparison with that in MG (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). The ratio of T/E
 <sub>2</sub> in essential oil groups was lower than that in the corresponding dose of juice groups. Both of bergamot and sweet orange groups had shown a dosage-effect relationship.
