<p>The results of TG level are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Compared with the MG, each intervention group significantly reduced the content of TG in the sebaceous gland of golden hamsters (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the TG level in sweet orange essential oil groups was obviously decreased in contrast with the corresponding dose of juice groups (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). The content of TG in bergamot essential oil groups was lower than that in the corresponding dose of juice groups. Both of bergamot and sweet orange groups exhibited effects on attenuating TG level with a dose-effect relationship.
