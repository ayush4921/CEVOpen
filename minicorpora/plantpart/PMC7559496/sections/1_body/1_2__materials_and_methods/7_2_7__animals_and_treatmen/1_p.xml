<p>Eighty male golden hamsters (120 ± 10 g) were purchased from Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China) (Certificate SCXK (Beijing) 2012-0001). The hamsters were acclimatized with a daily 12 h light/12 h dark cycle at 23 ± 1°C room temperature and 50 ± 2% relative humidity. After 1 week of adaptation, eighty golden hamsters were randomly divided into 10 groups: model group (MG), positive control group (PG), low-dose group of sweet orange juice (LOJ), high-dose group of sweet orange juice (HOJ), low-dose group of sweet orange essential oil (LOO), high-dose group of sweet orange essential oil (HOO), low-dose group of bergamot juice (LBJ), high-dose group of bergamot juice (HBJ), low-dose group of bergamot essential oil (LBO), and high-dose group of bergamot essential oil (HBO). The entire experiment lasted for four weeks. The MG was given physiological saline by oral route. The PG was administered 0.375 mg/kg BW of compound pearl acne capsules. The LOJ and HOJ were, respectively, orally given 14 and 17.5 mL/kg BW of sweet orange juice. The LOO and HOO received 0.21 and 0.33 mL/kg BW of sweet orange essential oil, respectively. The LBJ and HBJ were, respectively, treated with 14 and 17.5 mL/kg BW of bergamot juice. The LBO and HBO received 0.21 and 0.33 mL/kg BW of sweet bergamot essential oil, respectively. Juice and essential oil that contain a low dose and high dose, respectively, were from fresh fruits in the same weight. The gastric volume of each intervention was 10 mL/kg BW.</p>
