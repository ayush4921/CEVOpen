0: Acne vulgaris is a prevalent dermatologic disease, mainly distributed in the pilosebaceous units including the face, neck, chest, back, and shoulders.
1: The clinical manifestations of acne vulgaris are mainly seborrheic, noninflammatory skin lesions, inflammatory lesions, and varying degrees of scarring [ 1,  2].
2: More than 85% of young individuals are affected by acne vulgaris worldwide and can suffer from the disease into adulthood [ 3].
3: Although acne vulgaris is not life-threatening, this disease can have a huge impact on patients' psychosocial and physical health.
4: Acne vulgaris results from the androgen-induced sebum production, altered keratinization, inflammation, and colonization of  Propionibacterium acnes ( P. acnes) on the pilosebaceous follicles [ 4].
5: Among them, inflammations are present in all acne vulgaris lesionsincluding microcomedones, inflammatory lesions, hyperpigmentation, and scarring [ 5,  6].
6: Also, acne vulgaris is associated with diet, occupation, climate, and psychological and lifestyle factors [ 7,  8].
7: Thus, more and more researchers are getting interested in preventing acne vulgaris.
8: According to recent dermatologic guidelines, the current treatments for acne vulgaris are divided into conventional pharmacological and nonpharmacological therapies.
9: The former therapies include antibiotics, retinoids, hormonal agents, and benzoyl peroxide while laser and light-based therapies, chemical peels, micro-needling, (micro) dermabrasion, and (mechanical) lesion removal are the latter therapies most commonly applied [ 9,  10].
10: Nevertheless, none of these therapies is free of side effect [ 11].
11: Furthermore, more investigations are needed to seek alternative and complementary medicine, including medicinal plants.
