Since sebum contains approximately 30% TG, the amount of sebum synthesis and secretion was reflected in the study by measuring the TG content in the sebaceous gland tissue of golden hamsters. The study found that bergamot essential oil, bergamot juice, sweet orange essential oil, and sweet orange juice can significantly reduce the TG content of golden hamsters, indicating that each intervention substance can improve acne vulgaris via restraining TG level to a certain extent (
