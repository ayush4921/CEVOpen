 <italic>Bacillus</italic> spp. was counted in different minced samples contain spices powder of cumin, black seeds, cloves, cinnamon, and marjoram under levels of 0.5% and 1.0% and control sample during storage at 4±1°C up to 15 days. The results revealed that 
 <italic>Bacillus</italic> spp. count increased in the control sample; thus, its counts at zero time were (3.333 log
 <sub>10</sub> CFU/g) and reached to (3.439 log
 <sub>10</sub> CFU/g) at the end of storage periods. Concerning the treated samples, the microbial count reached zero after 12 days of the refrigerated storage, except samples treated with cinnamon and marjoram spices powder under the level of 0.5%, which reached zero count after 15 days of storage. After 15 days of storage the difference between the control group and the samples treated with 0.5% spices powder of cumin, black seeds, cloves, cinnamon and marjoram was statistically significant (p = 0.0229, 0.0082, 0.0136, 0.0114 and 0.0184, respectively). Furthermore, the difference between the control group and the samples treated with 1% spices powder of cumin, black seeds, cloves, cinnamon and marjoram was statistically significant (p = 0.0029, &lt;0.0001, 0.0014, 0.0044 and 0.0049) after 15 days of storage (
