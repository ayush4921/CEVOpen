0: Several molecular techniques that rely on DNA sequencing have been used to reveal the genetic relationship of bacillus strains.
1: 15 Enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus-PCR (ERIC-PCR) was used to screen for genetic relatedness.
2: On the other hand, the application of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) has been proven to be useful for the discrimination and epidemiological characterization of  B. cereus group strains.
