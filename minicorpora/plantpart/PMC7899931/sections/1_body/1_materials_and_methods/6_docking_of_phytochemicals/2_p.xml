<p id="p0075">All eight virtually screened phytochemicals were docked with targeted COVID-19 proteins, based on their antiviral properties and performed molecular docking for each of the phytochemicals (ligands) from the selected plants with the active sites of targeted proteins. Docking was performed by the online server PATCHDOCK for rigid protein and small peptide docking. PATCHDOCK is based on a geometry-based molecular docking algorithm, which finds docking transformations and results in the best-docked complex of receptor and ligand (
