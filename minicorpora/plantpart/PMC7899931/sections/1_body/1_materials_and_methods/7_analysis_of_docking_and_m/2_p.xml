<p id="p0080">Analysis of docking was done in PYMOL and Discovery Studio. All docking complexes from eight compounds and three proteins were analyzed separately in the PYMOL and Discovery Studio to visualize the best molecular geometry of ligandâ€“protein interaction. Docked scores were analyzed for the distinction of good or bad docked conformation (
