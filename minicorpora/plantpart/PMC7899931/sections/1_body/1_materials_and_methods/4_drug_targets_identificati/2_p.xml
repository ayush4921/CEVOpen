<p id="p0065">The drug targets were identified from current literature and protein complexes were retrieved from Protein Databank with resolution: 2.50–3.0 A° for the docking studies having PDB Id’s 1P9S, 3BGF, 6 M71. The mutation of selected proteins was verified from the coronavirus proteome. The 3D structures of these proteins were analyzed in PYMOL and Discovery studio and prepared for docking. The downloaded PDB files of the targeted proteins were checked for mutation analysis. During the preparation of receptor protein, the incomplete atoms and residues are amended by adjacent residues. And remove the unwanted chains of the protein from the protein complex (
