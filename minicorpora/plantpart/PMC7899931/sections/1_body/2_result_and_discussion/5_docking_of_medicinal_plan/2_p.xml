<p id="p0320">As RdRp is the basis for the design for the new therapies to cure COVID-19 we dock it with some of the phytochemicals and it shows best interaction with three compounds namely Kemoferol, Monoterpene and S-Allylcysteine. The aminoacid MET
 <sub>87</sub> made a bond with multiple atoms of kemoferol with a bond distance of 1.85 A° to 2.28 A° showing hydrogen bonding and also made other specific hydrophobic interactions with other amino acids ASN
