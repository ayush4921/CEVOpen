During the time of the Prophet Muhammad (SAW) the Prophet recived a jar of pickled ginger as a gift from Byzantine Emperor. The Prophet Muhammad (SAW) ate from the jar and shared a piece with each of his Companions. Many of the health benefits of ginger were also described in book, “The Prophetic Medicine by Ibn Qayyim El-Jawziyyah”.</p>
