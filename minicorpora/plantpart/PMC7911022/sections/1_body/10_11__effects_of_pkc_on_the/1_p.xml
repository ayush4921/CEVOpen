<p>Mannan oligosaccharide content of PKC plays various biological functions, particularly in minimizing gut pathogens and enhancing poultry’s immune responses [
 <xref rid="B96-animals-11-00338" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. It was reported that mannose and manno-oligosaccharides could act as prebiotics by improving the chicken immune system, reducing the gut’s harmful bacteria and increasing non-pathogenic bacteria population [

 <xref rid="B97-animals-11-00338" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>] showed that antibody responses against infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) were higher in birds fed with manno-oligosaccharides (MOS) supplemented diet. Moreover, the maternal antibody titers in chicks were also significantly influenced by MOS supplementation. Soltan [
 <xref rid="B66-animals-11-00338" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] showed that the inclusion of 18% PKC in broiler feeding diet significantly improved relative spleen weight, whereas 5% of PKC non-significantly increased relative spleen weight. Nonetheless, the different inclusion levels of PKC showed no significant improvement in the relative weights of the bursa and thymus gland compared to control. However, feed supplementation of mannanase for broiler chickens improves gut morphology and plasma immunological status [
