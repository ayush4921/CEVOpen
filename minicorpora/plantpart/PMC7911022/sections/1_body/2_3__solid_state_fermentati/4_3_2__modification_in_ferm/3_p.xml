 <xref rid="B55-animals-11-00338" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] reported that fermented substrate by 
 <italic>Trichoderma viride</italic>, containing 80% PKC and 20% rice bran, increased CP from 13.38 to 17.34% and decreased crude fiber from 30.55 to 23.67%. Nevertheless, the primary concern for fungal fermentation is the production of various mycotoxins in the substrate. Deoxynivalenol, nivalenol, zearalenone, fumonisin, vomitoxin, patulin, aflatoxin, and ochratoxin are few examples of mycotoxins which can depress the growth of animals and could be hazardous for both human and animals. The mycotoxin problem can be prevented by substituting fungi with various cellulolytic bacteria in SSF [
