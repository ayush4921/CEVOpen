<p>Dietary fibers are heterogeneous dietary components that are not hydrolyzed by the digestive enzymes of non-ruminant animals [
 <xref rid="B51-animals-11-00338" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. For proper functioning of the digestive organs, poultry requires a low amount of complex fiber in their diet. The SSF of PKC produces a product that contains low hemicellulose and cellulose concentration but high protein content [
 <xref rid="B19-animals-11-00338" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Microbial fermentation using bacteria or fungi has been documented to improve agricultural by-productsâ€™ nutritional values by altering its composition. Findings from numerous studies suggest that both bacterial and fungal fermentation increase the total protein and decrease fiber contents of PKC [
