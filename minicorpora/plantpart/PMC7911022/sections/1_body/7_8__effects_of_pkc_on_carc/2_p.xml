<p>On the other hand, PKC at 0, 5, 10, 20, and 30% inclusion levels in broiler diet did not significantly affect birdsâ€™ carcass characteristics [

 <xref rid="B84-animals-11-00338" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>], and Pushpakumara et al. [
 <xref rid="B70-animals-11-00338" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], that PKC did not significantly affect the dressing percentage of birds. These variations of PKC effects on birds dressing percentage may be due to different ration types, nutrient content, birds breed, environmental conditions, processing, and management conditions.
