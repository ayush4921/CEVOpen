<p>It was reported [
 <xref rid="B80-animals-11-00338" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>] that the liver weight of birds fed with 0% PKC diet was significantly higher than those of birds fed with 10% PKC diet, whereas the weight of heart of chickens fed 0% PKC was significantly lower than birds fed with 10, 20, and 30% PKC diet. Besides, the proventriculus weight of birds fed with 30% PKC diet was also significantly higher compared to birds fed with 10% or 20% PKC diets. Pushpakumara et al. [
 <xref rid="B70-animals-11-00338" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] determined that liver weights of birds fed with 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20% levels of PKC were not significantly different among birds fed with varying treatment diets. Besides, Soltan [
 <xref rid="B66-animals-11-00338" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] showed that gizzard size and relative spleen weight did not significantly increase at 5% inclusion level of PKC but increased substantially with 10, 15 and 20% inclusion levels in broiler diet compared with 0% PKC group. Zanu et al. [
 <xref rid="B60-animals-11-00338" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] showed the same findings that the gizzard of laying chickens increased with 15% inclusion level of PKC. Okeudo et al. [
 <xref rid="B83-animals-11-00338" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>] reported that gizzard weight was significantly higher in birds fed with 10, 20, and 30% PKC diet compared with the 0% PKC group. The increase in gizzard size could be due to the high fiber content of PKC [
 <xref rid="B85-animals-11-00338" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. An increase in spleenâ€™s relative weight following the feeding of fungal on fermented PKC or PKM could be due to the influence of fungal toxin during SSF [
