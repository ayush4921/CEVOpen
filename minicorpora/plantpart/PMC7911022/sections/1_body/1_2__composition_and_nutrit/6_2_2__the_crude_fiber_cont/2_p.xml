<p>Cellulose is the most significant structural component of the plant cell wall [
 <xref rid="B37-animals-11-00338" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin represent approximately 20–50%, 15–35%, and 10–30% of plant cell walls respectively on a dry weight basis [
 <xref rid="B38-animals-11-00338" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Different species of cellulolytic bacteria and fungi can hydrolyze lignocellulose in plant cell walls [
 <xref rid="B39-animals-11-00338" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], as a significant fraction of lignocellulose is composed of carbohydrates. Hence it can be used as a source of renewable energy [
 <xref rid="B40-animals-11-00338" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. For instance, mannan degrading enzymes can be added in the broiler diet to breakdown the main polysaccharide component. This will directly improve feed digestibility and feed efficiency [

 <xref rid="B41-animals-11-00338" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. A study has observed that the effect of PKM supplemented with enzyme contributed greater nutrient digestibility compared to enzyme-free diet, resulting in a higher body weight gains and better feed conversion ratio (FCR) among birds fed with enzyme supplemented diets (40). Hydrolysis tests showed that the yield of monosaccharides obtained represented nearly 75% of the total polysaccharides content in PKC [
 <xref rid="B23-animals-11-00338" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Common monosaccharides composition of PKC includes glucose, fructose, and mannose at 154, 218, and 22.1 mg/100 g, respectively [
