<p>The fiber inclusion response depends on the source and amount of dietary fiber and dietary characteristics, likewise for the bird’s physiological and health status [

 <xref rid="B26-animals-11-00338" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The CF content of PKC, ranging from 16–18%, is acceptable to most ruminants, but it may not be suitable if included at the high levels in poultry or pig diets. Insoluble and soluble fibers present in PKC are the main reasons for a lower nutrient digestibility in monogastric animals [
 <xref rid="B35-animals-11-00338" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, the CF content of PKC can be significantly reduced through fermentation [
