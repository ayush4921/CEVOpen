 <xref rid="animals-11-00338-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> illustrates the amino acid contents of PKC. Digestible amino acids are essential for determining acceptable sources of protein and dietary supplements. PKC can be utilized as a source of protein as well as an energy source [
 <xref rid="B6-animals-11-00338" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The CP values of PKC range between 14 and 21% and this variation in CP can be attributed to the different processing methods [
 <xref rid="B33-animals-11-00338" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This level is low for starter diets for young chicks, but it is adequate for older birds that require lower protein diets. Furthermore, due to the poor amino acid content, especially essential amino acids such as lysine and methionine, the nutritional value of PKC is considered very low [
