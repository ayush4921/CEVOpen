<p>Gut microflora benefits the host by helping in digestion, absorption, and storage of nutrients. Furthermore, gut microflora control and improve epithelial immune responses and function [

 <xref rid="B10-animals-11-00338" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. For instance, the inclusion of 15% FPKC in broiler feeding diet significantly increased the LAB counts compared to the negative control and different PKC groups’ levels. Simultaneously, no significant difference was observed between the dietary treatments in 
 <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> (ENT) counts [

 <xref rid="B30-animals-11-00338" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] showed that broiler chickens fed with 25% PKM significantly increased counts of 
 <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> sp. and 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic> sp. in both caecum and ileum. Loh et al. [
 <xref rid="B91-animals-11-00338" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>] showed that the addition of 6 and 9% fermented products in laying hens feeding diets reduced the ENT population in feces and increased the fecal LAB population.
