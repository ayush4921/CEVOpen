<p>Alshelmani et al. [
 <xref rid="B35-animals-11-00338" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] reported no significant difference in birdsâ€™ morphology of small intestine among the different diets (5, 10, and 15% PKC and FPKC) groups. Utilization of FPKC until at level 9% with no significant effects on height and density of villi in all parts of the small intestine, whereas at 18% level, only jejunum villi were significantly lower [

 <xref rid="B90-animals-11-00338" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>] showed that chickens fed PKM at 15% in diet did not affect ileum morphology. Meanwhile, Zulkifli et al. [
 <xref rid="B30-animals-11-00338" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] showed that the 25% inclusion of PKM significantly increased the villi height and width. Findings by Sabour et al. [
 <xref rid="B87-animals-11-00338" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] indicated that fibrous supplementation increased villus height of broilers chickens. Hence the improvements of gut morphology may be due to the high fiber content of PKC [
