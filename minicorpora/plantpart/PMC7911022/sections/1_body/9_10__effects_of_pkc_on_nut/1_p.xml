<p>Generally, poultry feed formulation is based on digestibility and absorption in the diet. It is known that most dietary fibers in PKC are in the form of mannan, which is not hydrolyzed by digestive enzymes of those non-ruminant animals. Therefore, nutrient digestibility decreases with increasing PKC in birds’ feeding diet [

It was described that 10 and 15% PKC in broiler diet in both starter and finisher phases significantly decreased digestibility of DM, CP, EE, and nitrogen-free extract (NFE) compared to the negative control. However, there was no significant difference observed in DM, CP, and EE digestibility for 10 and 15% FPKC. Additionally, no significant difference was observed in ash’s digestibility for 10 and 15% FPKC than the negative control. In contrast, ash’s digestibility was lower for 15% PKC than the negative control group [

 <xref rid="B64-animals-11-00338" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] reported that CP, ash, and NFE digestibility values in the control group (0% PKM) were significantly higher than other PKM diets with or without enzyme supplementation. Another study conducted by Fadil et al. [
 <xref rid="B42-animals-11-00338" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] determined that the digestibility of DM, gross energy, and CP for 35% PKC included diet in ducks was more impoverished than 0 and 15% PKC diet.
