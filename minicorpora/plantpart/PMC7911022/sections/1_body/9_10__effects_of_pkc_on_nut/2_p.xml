<p>Dietary protein sources are known to affect broiler nutrient digestibility [
 <xref rid="B93-animals-11-00338" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. It was claimed that CP, CF, and EE’s digestibility decreased with PKC inclusion in broiler diet [
 <xref rid="B80-animals-11-00338" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. The decrease in nutrient digestibility of chickens fed with PKC could be attributed mainly to the lack of any mannan-degrading enzymes in poultry’s digestive system [
 <xref rid="B10-animals-11-00338" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Moreover, indigestible fiber molecules could increase the passage rate of ingesta and could decrease nutrient absorption. Consequently, high levels of dietary fiber led to a reduction in the digestibility of energy, starch, protein, and lipids in monogastric [
 <xref rid="B51-animals-11-00338" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Furthermore, insoluble materials in diet could increase the viscosity of intestinal digesta, leading to reduced digestibility and absorption of nutrients [
 <xref rid="B94-animals-11-00338" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. Moreover, Hakim et al. [
 <xref rid="B95-animals-11-00338" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>], show that bacterial fermentation, enzymatic fermentation and thermal extrusion have the potential to improve the apparent metabolizable energy (AME) of PKC. Both bacterial and enzymatic fermentation enhanced the CP digestibility. However, Lawal et al. [
 <xref rid="B33-animals-11-00338" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] reported that feeding treated PKC with enzymes contributed to better nutrient digestibility of broiler chickens.
