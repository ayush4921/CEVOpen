<p>An optimum level of PKC or PKM in broiler chickens’ diets to enhance growth performance can be achieved through solid-state biodegradation. It has been proposed that the biomass of PKC or PKM can be treated with microbes. These microbes can produce extracellular proteolytic, cellulolytic, and hemicellulolytic enzymes to improve nutritional values [

It maybe due to the fact that the mannanase, α-galactosidase, cellulase, and various other fibrolytic enzymes in broilers’ diets increase the degradation of diet and eventually increase the growth performance of birds [
