<p>In broiler chickens, growth performance is the most important economic factor in their production. It was reported that broiler chickens could tolerate up to 40% of PKM inclusion without adverse effects when those diets were formulated based on digestible amino acids and metabolizable energy [

Furthermore, another study indicated that the inclusion of 8 and 16% PKM increased weight gain compared to 0% PKC diet, whereas weight gain was severely reduced by feeding 24% PKM diets. Meanwhile, 0 and 16% PKM diets had similar feed intake, whereas feed intake of 8% PKM diet was higher among the groups [

 <xref rid="B17-animals-11-00338" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] determined that 15% PKC in broiler feeding diet led to a significant decrease in body weight gain compared to 0 and 5% PKC. The finisher phase of broilers fed with 10 and 15% PKC had lower growth performance than birds fed with 0 and 5% PKC. Bodyweight gains of birds fed with 10 and 15% PKC were significantly lower than birds fed with the same levels of FPKC and control groups. The FCR was higher (2.07 and 2.16 g:g) for 10 and 15% PKC compared with the same levels of FPKC (1.83 and 1.93 g:g) and control groups (1.91 g:g), respectively. While the body weight gain was significantly lower for chickens fed with 10 and 15% PKC compared to the same levels of FPKC and control groups. Moreover, Rahim et al. [
