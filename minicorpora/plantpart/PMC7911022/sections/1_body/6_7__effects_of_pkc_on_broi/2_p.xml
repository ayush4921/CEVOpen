<p>Anaeto et al. [
 <xref rid="B1-animals-11-00338" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] have reported the effect of feeding broiler during the finisher phase with 0, 10, 20, and 30% PKC. There was a significant difference in weight gain among the birds, with birds fed 20 and 30% PKC diets had higher weight gain, while feed intake and FCR were not significantly different. In contrast to another study, PKC inclusion at 5 and 10% in broilers’ diet did not adversely affect the body weight, daily body weight gains, and feed intake. In contrast, the inclusion of PKC at 15 and 20% significantly reduced birds performances [

 <xref rid="B60-animals-11-00338" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] referred that PKC inclusion at 15% level in layers’ diets did not affect the feed intake while significantly reduced body weight gain. A study on Muscovy ducks showed that 35% of PKC’s inclusion significantly increased feed intake and reduced FCR [
 <xref rid="B42-animals-11-00338" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. A research conducted by Pushpakumara et al. [
 <xref rid="B70-animals-11-00338" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] showed that weight gain of birds fed with diet containing 20% PKC, was significantly lower compared with birds fed with 10% and 15% PKC. The feed intake of birds fed with 15% PKC was significantly higher than birds fed with 0 and 5% PKC. Meanwhile, the FCR of birds fed with 20% PKC was significantly higher than all other treatments. In contrast, the FCR of birds was not significantly affected by the inclusion of PKC at 5%, 10%, and 15%.
