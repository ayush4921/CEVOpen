0: Costs of feeds have always been a significant concern in local poultry production [ 4].
1: Poultry production costs have continually increased because of the fluctuation prices of high-quality raw materials such as soybean, corn, and others [ 5].
2: Several initiatives have been put in place, such as finding cheaper and locally available materials as partial substitutable protein and energy sources instead of SBM and corn in poultry feed formulations.
3: Various locally available and low-priced feedstuffs have been proposed but have not been satisfactorily acceptable for poultry and consequently used in small proportions [ 6].
4: Fluctuations in price and comparatively inadequate SBM supply, particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic, lead to city lockdown, and logistics limitation [ 7, 8].
5: As a result, the discovery of alternative protein sources for poultry feeding diet has become a particular focus in the current scenario to decrease reliance on SBM as the main ingredient of protein in poultry feeds [ 9].
