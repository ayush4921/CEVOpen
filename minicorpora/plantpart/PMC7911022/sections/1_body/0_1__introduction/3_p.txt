0: Generally, most agricultural industries produce large amounts of residue every year.
1: If waste is not effectively managed, it could contribute to the environment and harm both human and animal health.
2: Waste products from the palm oil extraction industry constitute a huge problem, and any initiative towards economic utilization is a positive step towards solving environmental pollution [ 10].
3: Some countries around the world produce plenty of local alternative feedstuffs which are by-products of the agricultural industry.
4: More often, these materials such as wheat bran, rice bran, cottonseed meal, copra meal, PKC, palm kernel meal (PKM) wheat pollard, cocoa pods, oil palm fronds (OPF), palm oil mill effluent (POME), sugarcane bagasse, and cassava waste are widely used as livestock feeds [ 11, 12].
5: Most of these by-products contain significant amounts of anti-nutritional factors (ANF) which are also considered as non-starch polysaccharides (NSPs) [ 11].
6: Locally, large quantities of PKC have been produced from the oil palm industry, and comprehensive studies are needed to assess its potential as alternative protein sources for poultry feeds [ 2].
