0: PKC usage is common in ruminant diets but limited in non-ruminant, especially in poultry diets due to its high fiber content [ 6].
1: PKC can be a promising feedstuff for poultry feed because of its moderate CP (16.43%) content and energy [ 17].
2: Cellulolytic bacteria can significantly improve the nutrient quality of PKC through SSF [ 18, 19].
3: Therefore, this review paper will critically shed light on the composition and nutritional value of PKC, SSF in PKC, and the utilization of PKC as a poultry feed and its effects.
