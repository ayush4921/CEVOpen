<p>Malaysia is one of the worldâ€™s largest palm oil producers with abundant PKC available throughout the year. There is a need to efficiently utilize this by-product as an alternative feed for the local poultry industry [
 <xref rid="B17-animals-11-00338" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The importation cost of corn and SBM dramatically influences the price of animal feedstuff in the country, making PKC an alternative feed ingredient. To poultry farmers, the primary factor in utilizing PKC is its relatively low price to be used as one of the ingredients in poultry diets [
 <xref rid="B62-animals-11-00338" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. The feed cost per/kg decreases with increasing levels of PKC [

Nonetheless, the challenge of using agro-byproducts as feed ingredients for poultry is the presence of fiber components in these materials. Since poultry has a simple digestive system, the inclusion of PKC in their feeding diet is limited because of the absence of fiber digestive enzyme activities in their gastrointestinal tract (GIT) [
