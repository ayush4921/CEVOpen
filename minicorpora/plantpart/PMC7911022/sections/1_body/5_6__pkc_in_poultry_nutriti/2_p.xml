<p>Few researchers have reported variations of optimum inclusion level of PKC in poultry rations. The use of PKC in poultry depends on the type, age, and sex of the chickens, as well as the sources and variations of oil and shell content of the PKC [

 <xref rid="B46-animals-11-00338" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Edwards et al. [
 <xref rid="B62-animals-11-00338" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] suggested that PKC in poultry diets should be limited to 20%. The same finding by Anaeto et al. [
 <xref rid="B1-animals-11-00338" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] showed that broiler birds could utilize PKC based diet up to 20% without adverse effects on their production performance. Furthermore, Ugwu et al. [
