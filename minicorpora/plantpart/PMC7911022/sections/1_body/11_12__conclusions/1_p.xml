<p>Conclusively, PKC is acceptable to be included in ruminants’ diet, but may not be suitable to be included at high levels in poultry diets owing to the high CF content. In regular farm practice, not more than 6-8% PKC level is included in broiler chickens’ dietary without affecting growth performance, carcass yield, intestinal microflora and morphology, nutrient digestibility, and chicken’s immune system. However, this agriculture biomass could be treated by various microorganisms through SSF, increasing the inclusion level (10–15% FPKC) in the diets without affecting broilers’ production performance. SSF of PKC help to decrease CF levels by degrading the complex carbohydrate fractions. Furthermore, microbial activities in SSF contribute to increasing levels of CP, amino acids, and energy in FPKC. Additionally, the inclusion of biodegraded PKC in broilers feeding diets could ultimately improve gut health, increase nutrient digestibility, and improve chickens’ overall growth performance.</p>
