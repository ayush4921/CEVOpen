 <italic>C. quinquefasciatus</italic> were collected from Regional Medical Research Centre (RMRC- ICMR), Dibrugarh, Assam, India. The collected eggs were reared in an insect culture room, Dept. of Zoology, Gauhati University and the colonies were maintained between 25 – 29 °C temperature and 80–90% relative humidity following the method described by 
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Arivoli and Tennyson (2011)</xref>. The egg rafts were kept in plastic trays containing 1000 ml of tap water and they were fed on finely powdered dog biscuits and yeast powder (3:1). After the fourth instar larval stage, pupae emerged. The pupal stage was transferred to a disposable cup half filled with water and kept in wooden netted cage of size measuring (1 × 1 × 1 m), where they finally metamorphosed in to the adult stage within 1–3 days. No food was provided to the pupal stage. The adult colony was provided with 10% glucose solution soaked in cotton kept in the glass petri-dishes. After 3–4 days of adult emergence, an albino rat was provided for blood-feeding. Gravid females after 1–2 days of blood feeding laid eggs on the plastic cups containing water.
