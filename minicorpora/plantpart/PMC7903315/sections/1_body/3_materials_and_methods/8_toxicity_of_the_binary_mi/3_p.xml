 <sub>a</sub> and O
 <sub>b</sub> were the observed mortalities of individual treatment at the given concentration or dose. The effects of mixtures were designated as either antagonistic or synergistic by analysis using

 <sup>2</sup> comparisons. If the chi-square value was greater than the table value at definite degrees of freedom and at the same time, the observed mortality was higher than the expected mortality, then the combination was considered to possess synergism. Again, if the observed mortality was lower than the expected mortality, the mixture was considered to possess antagonistic effect. The combination with chi-square value lower than the table value at definite degrees of freedom, it signified neither synergistic nor antagonistic effect.
