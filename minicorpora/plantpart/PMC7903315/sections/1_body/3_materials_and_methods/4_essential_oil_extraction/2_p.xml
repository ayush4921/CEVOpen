<p id="p0115">After washing, collected parts of the plants (500 g) were cut into small pieces and the essential oil was extracted through hydro distillation method using Clevenger's apparatus following the method described by 
 <xref rid="bib93" ref-type="bibr">Kumar et al. (2010)</xref>. The chopped plant materials were placed in 5 L round bottom flask containing 2–3 L of water and allowed to heat over heating mantle for about 5–6 h which softens the plant materials and allows the release of essential oil in volatile form. The thermostat of the heating mantel was set at 50 °C for extraction of essential oil. The essential oil vapours were condensed and formed a two layered mixture having essential oil in the top layer at the recuperating container. Essential oils were collected and stored in clean glass vials after removing water traces with the help of micropipette and stored at 4 °C.
