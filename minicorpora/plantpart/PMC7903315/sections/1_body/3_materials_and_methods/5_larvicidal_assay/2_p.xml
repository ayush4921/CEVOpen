<p id="p0120">To investigate the larvicidal activity, the standard World Health Organization procedure was followed with little modification. 20 numbers of third instar larvae were transferred to the disposable cups (depth 5–10 cm) having 100 ml of water where 100 and 1000 ppm concentrations were applied as mentioned above. Based on the results of the pilot test of the essential oil at 100 and 1000 ppm of concentrations, a wide range of concentrations (1 ppm, 5 ppm, 10 ppm, 25 ppm, 50 ppm, 100 ppm, 250 ppm, 500 ppm, 750 ppm, 1000 ppm) of essential oils were prepared using equal amount of dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) as emulsifying agent. For Temephos, three more concentrations (0.1ppm, 0.5 ppm and 1ppm) were applied. Twenty numbers of 3rd instar larvae were transferred to each replica of each concentration. The mortality was recorded after 24 h by observing larval death. The LC50 and LC10 concentrations were calculated after 24 h of treatment. Each concentration was assayed in triplicate along with one negative control group in water without any treatment and one positive control group treated with equal concentration of DMSO. Larvae which did not respond to any mechanical stimulus were considered as dead, while those which did not show any kind of swimming movement were considered moribund. The moribund larvae which were unable to revive for next 24 h were considered as dead (
