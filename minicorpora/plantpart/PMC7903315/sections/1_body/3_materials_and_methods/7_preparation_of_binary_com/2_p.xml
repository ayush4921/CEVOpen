<p id="p0160">Considering the LC50 (Or LD50) concentration/dose of each of the selected plant oils (below 100 ppm for larvae; below 6 μg/cm
 <sup>2</sup> for adults) effective oils were short listed and they were further studied to explore the joint toxicity in mixtures at different volume ratios. Initially, the pilot study was performed taking 1:1 volume of LC50/LD50 concentration/dose of each of the candidate oil (Table S5) following the same method described above. However, each of the prepared binary mixtures comprising of LC50 concentration (Or LD50) of each candidate oil is found to cause cent percent mortality among the treated mosquitoes and hence the concentration was reduced to LC10 or LD10 and the rest of the combinations of oils were prepared based on LC10 concentration against the larval stage and LD10 dose against the adult stage of
