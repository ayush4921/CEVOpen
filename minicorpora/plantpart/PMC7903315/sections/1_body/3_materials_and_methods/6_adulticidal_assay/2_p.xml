<p id="p0135">Impregnated filter paper method was followed by 
 <xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">Ramar et al. (2013)</xref> to study the adulticidal activity of the selected essential oils against the target species. Initially two concentrations (10 μg/cm
 <sup>2</sup> and 1 μg/cm
 <sup>2</sup>) of each selected essential oil were prepared in 2 ml of acetone and applied on Whatman no.1 filter papers (size 12 × 15 cm
 <sup>2</sup>). 10 numbers of 4–5 days old non blood fed adult female mosquitoes were selected for each replication. Three replications were set for each concentration. Based on the results of pilot study of the essential oil, a wide range of concentrations (0.01–10 μg/cm
 <sup>2</sup>) of essential oils was prepared. For positive control, filter papers were treated with 2 ml of acetone alone and placed in exposure tubes (depth 10 cm). After the evaporation time of acetone (5 min), ten numbers of 3–4 days old sugar-fed female mosquitoes were released into the tubes. One control group with acetone was placed for each of the oils tested. Adults were considered dead if they did not move when disturbed repeatedly with a soft brush. The LC50 and LC10 concentrations were calculated after 24 h of exposure by probit analysis and finally expressed in microgram/cm
 <sup>2</sup>. If the recorded mortality percentage was found to exceed 20% in the control batch, the experiment was repeated. However, if mortality in the controls was found more than 5%, the recorded data were corrected using Abbott's correction formula
