<p id="p0090">This experiment provides us a product of binary mixture of the same plant essential oils that acts equally against two developmental stages of this particular mosquito species. Such findings are expected to provide promising alternative measures for reducing the use of synthetic insecticides, which might be effective in terms of cost, toxicity and resistance development. Plant essential oils generally are nontoxic to mammals and other vertebrates. Botanical insecticides developed on the basis of EO are gaining importance because of their environmental and health safety attributes. They are considered to be safe, and eco-friendly alternatives to the synthetic chemicals, although a few studies raise questions about the safety of certain plant essential oils and their constituent compounds. In fact, the most important issue to be considered for the application of essential oils is their rapid degradation under the impact of air and light. Their direct and indirect effects on the other non-target organisms and the economic aspects must be considered before commercialization.</p>
