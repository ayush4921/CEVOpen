<p id="p0075">In case of larvae and adults, some of the binary combinations consisting of temephos or malathion are not found to bear synergistic interaction though they are individually effective as larvicides and adulticides. The possible explanation for such effect is that the synthetic insecticides possess high hydrophobicity and affinity with the essential oils due to which the molecules of the synthetic insecticides get dispersed in the essential oil and as a result bioavailability is decreased (
 <xref rid="bib84" ref-type="bibr">Suwannayod et al., 2019</xref>). However, in some cases the synergistic interaction is also recorded in the temephos or malathion-based combinations. Such outcomes may provide new information that the recommended doses of some of the synthetic organophosphates can be reduced whenever applied as a mixture with plant essential oils. In addition, the rate of susceptibility towards the prepared binary mixtures is found to differ among the different developmental stages of 
 <italic>C. quinquefasciatus</italic>. Larvae are found to be the most susceptible as in most of the cases synergistic interaction is recorded which can be supported by the findings of 
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Fox et al. (2011)</xref> as they mentioned that the larval stage was more responsive to any physical and chemical stresses than the other developmental stages. From the findings it can be concluded that the mixture of essential oil of 
 <italic>A. sativum</italic> and 
 <italic>C. paradisi</italic> is found to be effective against larval and adult stage of the filarial vector. The only difference is in case of the larval stages where the effective combination was 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>sativum</italic> (bulbs) and 
 <italic>C. paradisi</italic> (leaves) oils and in other cases 
 <italic>A. sativum</italic> (bulbs) and 
 <italic>C. paradisi</italic> (peels).
