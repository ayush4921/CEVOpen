<p id="p0055">In the present study, some of the plant essential oils like 
 <italic>L. camara</italic>, 
 <italic>F. benghalensis</italic>, 
 <italic>Z. officinale</italic>, 
 <italic>M. koengii, C. fistula</italic> etc. are found to be ineffective against the target species, though these candidate oils were reported to possess insecticidal activities in previous studies (
 <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">Rahuman et al., 2008</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Govindarajan, 2010</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">Rajan and Varghese, 2017</xref>). Differences in the constituent profile of plant essential oils may affect its toxicity. Climatic condition, geographic location, method of extraction, time of harvesting, soil properties are some of the factors which determine the constituent compounds of an essential oil (
 <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Mahanta et al., 2017</xref>). Differences in susceptibility of the treated individuals to the different oils are due to differential rates of uptake, penetration through the chorion which is dependent on the exposure period, detoxification and failure of the toxicant to reach the target (
 <xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">Ramar et al., 2013</xref>). The constituent profiles of each of the selected essential oils are mentioned here (Table S6). Some of the reported compounds (e.g. limonene from 
 <italic>P. alba</italic>, alpha pinene from 
 <italic>E. odoratum</italic>, Eugenol from 
 <italic>C. fistula</italic>, 1,8- cineol from 
 <italic>C. linnearis</italic> etc.) of these plants are found to possess insecticidal activities against mosquitoes (
 <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Pavela, 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">Sarma et al., 2019</xref>) though they are not able to cause mortality in the present study whenever tested as crude oils against 
 <italic>C. quinquefasciatus</italic>. This may be due to the interference of some other minor compounds present in the crude essential oils. Again, the role of the environmental temperature in differential performance of EOs and their constituents cannot be overruled. It has already been established that the same plant oil or constituent show different biocidal activities in different environmental temperatures. 
 <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Pavela and Sedlak (2018)</xref> experimentally proved higher efficacy of 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> EO and its constituents carvacrol and thymol at the lower temperature (15 °C) in comparison to the higher temperature (30 °C) against larvae of 
 <italic>C. quinquefasciatus</italic>. However, in the present study almost uniform laboratory temperature range is maintained during the experimental period. It is also reported in literature that some plant EOs may not show prominent acute toxicity at sublethal concentrations but the treatment may impact on fertility and vitality in the next generation (
 <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Pavela, 2012</xref>). In a recent study 
 <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">Pavela et al. (2020)</xref> showed noticeable reduction of fertility, lower hatching abilities as well as lower vitalities in houseflies in response to the treatment of the sublethal concentration of EO of 
 <italic>Carlina acaulis</italic> and its constituent carlina oxide. Though, in the current study the effect of plant EO on fertility and vitality in the next generation was not studied, further work in this line may enrich information on efficacy of plant EO on this aspect.
