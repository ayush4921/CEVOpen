<p id="p0095">In the present investigation, after testing of 28 EOs and its selected binary mixtures against larval and adult stages of 
 <italic>C. quinquefasciatus</italic>, finally it gives some potential mixtures consisting of garlic oil and 
 <italic>Citrus</italic> oil. To the best of our knowledge, this is for the first time we have tested 155 numbers of binary mixtures comprising of only plant crude oils or the mixtures of plant oils plus synthetic insecticides and proposed some profoundly effective combinations of a very low concentration of LC10/LD10 [earlier some authors have reported the joint-toxicity of binary mixtures by using LC50 or LC25 concentrations basically taking the constituent compounds of plant oils (
