<p id="p0060">Plant essential oils usually present defences as a suite of compounds, not as individual ones. It is thought that a mixture of different constituent compounds, both major and minor constituents cumulatively act to offer plant defence against herbivory and pathogens through a variety of mechanisms. Therefore, in the present investigation, after observing the individual toxicity of the selected plant oils, 155 numbers of binary mixtures were prepared and tested against two developmental stages of the same target species in order to enhance the efficiency and to reduce the dose of a particular essential oil present in the mixture.</p>
