<p id="p0085">It is already proved that the presence of a penetration-enhancing effect in the synergistic combination is the primary mechanism of synergy. The synergy in botanical insecticides would be based on the activation of multiple-target sites, interaction with resistance mechanisms and pharmacokinetic effects that improve solubility (

Bio availability of active compounds at these optimum concentrations in prepared mixtures might be the probable cause for such outcomes (
