0: Aiming to reduce the dose of synthetic insecticides to be released in the environment and to prevent resistance occurrence, combinations of synthetic organophosphates with the effective plant oils are also attempted to get synergistic interactions in any mixtures.
1: The constituent profile of EOs of a plant species may vary in different regions.
2: However, insight on constituents in combination may further help to develop efficient mixtures by adding its ingredient irrespective of geographical barrier etc.
3: Therefore, to understand the constituent profile of the best combinations which are proved as the most effective against larval and adult stages of  C. quinquefasciatus in the study, GC-MS analysis is carried out and analysed.
