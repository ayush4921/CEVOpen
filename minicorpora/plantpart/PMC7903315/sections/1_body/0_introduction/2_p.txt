0: Medical science and entomologists have been facing a diverse set of challenges to protect humans and domesticated animals from harmful mosquitoes.
1: Considering the increasing populations of vector mosquitoes and cases of mosquito borne diseases, quick and proper counter measures are needed at the present time to improve the effectiveness of a vector control strategy.
2: Prompting the adoption of effective mosquito control strategies has resulted in an urge to look for a highly potent, eco-friendly and cost-effective plant-based product.
3: And the current study was aimed to establish low-dose plant essential oil-based synergistic combinations that would be effective against the larval and adult stages of the filarial vector,  Culex quinquefasciatus.
