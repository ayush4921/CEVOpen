<p id="p0030">The oil yield percentage of the selected essential oils is mentioned in Table S7. The highest oil yield was recorded for the peel part of the plant 
 <italic>C. grandis</italic>. On the other hand, the EOs from 
 <italic>Homalomena aromatic</italic> (leaves) and 
 <italic>Zingiber officinale</italic> (leaves) yielded the lowest amount. While recording the larvicidal activity of the selected essential oils, fourteen numbers of oils were found to possess no larvicidal activity since they did not cause any mortality even at the highest concentration (1000 ppm) (Table S2). LC50 values were determined for the rest of the fourteen EOs. Among the effective EOs, the LC50 value was found lowest in case of 
 <italic>M. piperita</italic> (leaves) oil with LC50 value of 2.31 ppm. The remaining candidates were found to possess LC50 values at a range of 18.23–275.66 ppm (Table S3). The highest larvicidal activity was exhibited by Temephos with LC50 concentration of 0.7 ppm. No mortality was recorded in the positive and negative control. In case of the bioassay against the adult stage, results demonstrated that some of the essential oils like 
 <italic>A. sativum</italic> (bulbs), 
 <italic>A. marmelos</italic> (leaves), 
 <italic>C. aurantifolia</italic> (peels) and 
 <italic>E. maculata</italic> (leaves) possessed strong adulticidal activity (Table S4). LD50 values could be calculated for seven numbers of plant essential oils. Among these, the lowest LD50 dose was recorded in case of 
 <italic>Citrus paradisi</italic> (peels) oil (0.35 μg/cm
 <sup>2</sup>), which was followed by essential oil of 
 <italic>A. sativum</italic> (bulbs). For Malathion, the recorded LD50 value was 0.3 μg/cm
 <sup>2</sup>. In positive and negative control, no adult mortality was recorded.
