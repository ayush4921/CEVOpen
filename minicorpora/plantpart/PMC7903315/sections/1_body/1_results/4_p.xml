<p id="p0035">Based on the individual toxicity of the selected essential oils and the two organophosphates, the effective oils were selected for the preparation of binary mixtures to study their joint - activity against the larval and adult stages of the same target species. Six numbers of EOs and temephos were short-listed for the preparations of binary mixtures against the larval stage. Against the adult stage, four numbers of EOs and the organophosphate malathion were selected for the preparations of binary mixtures. Initially, blending of LC50 concentrations of the selected candidates were considered, but the results demonstrated 100% mortality in each case (Table S5). As a result, it was difficult to underscore the most potent binary mixtures as all the mixtures had caused 100% observed mortality. Finally, the concentration was reduced to LC10 (against larvae) or LD10 (against adults) and binary mixtures were prepared at different volume ratios by mixing LC10 or LD10 concentrations/doses of each candidate present in the mixtures. It is obvious that if such results would be obtained even after reducing the concentration then it would be a better mosquito control agent from the point of cost, dose and toxicity towards the non-target organisms. For larvicidal activity, 83 numbers possessed synergistic effect in case of larvicidal activity. Four binary mixtures with antagonistic effect and eighteen numbers with no effect were also recorded (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Most of the temephos-based combinations were found to have synergistic interaction. Maximum numbers of 
 <italic>C. paradisi</italic> (leaves) essential oil-based combinations were found to cause 100% larval mortality except 
 <italic>C. paradisi</italic> (leaves) +
 <italic>C. grandis</italic> (leaves) mixture at 2:1 volume ratio. The lowest larval mortality (3.3%) was observed in 
 <italic>C. grandis</italic> (leaves) +Temephos (1:1) and 
 <italic>O. sanctum</italic> (leaves)+ 
 <italic>M. piperita</italic> (leaves) (1:1) mixtures. Fifty numbers of binary mixtures were tested against the adult stage of 
 <italic>C. quinquefasciatus</italic>, out of which 14 combinations were found to exhibit synergistic interaction with observed mortality at the range of 53–100% (
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Malathion-based combinations were found to show antagonistic or no effect except in 
 <italic>Citrus paradisi</italic> (peels)+Malathion (All volume ratios) and 
 <italic>A. sativum</italic> (bulbs)+Malathion (1:1) mixtures. However, fourteen numbers of mixtures were found to act antagonistically against the target individuals.
