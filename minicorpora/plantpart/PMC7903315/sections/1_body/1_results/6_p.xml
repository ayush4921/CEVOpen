<p id="p0045">A number of compounds are found to be present in it and based on its area percentages, probable major constituents are reported. From GC-MS analysis, the constituent profile of 
 <italic>A. sativum</italic> (bulbs)+ 
 <italic>Citrus paradisi</italic> (peels) combination showed the presence of diallyl trisulfide, diallyldisulfide, beta citronellol, ocimene as probable major constituents of the combination (Figures 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). However, in the binary mixture of 
 <italic>A. sativum</italic> (bulbs)+ 
 <italic>C. paradisi</italic> (leaves), the major constituents identified were diallyldisulfide, citronellal, diallyltrisulfide, caryophyllene oxide etc. The MS, molecular weight, retention index, area percentage and retention time are mentioned below (Figures 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, Tables 
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). The constituent profile of individual essential oils selected in the present study was mentioned in Table S6.
