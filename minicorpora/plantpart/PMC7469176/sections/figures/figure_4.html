 <caption> The averaged antennal response (EAD) of female box tree moths ( Cydalima perspectalis) to eucalyptus essential oil headspace samples (collected with SPME) measured by gas-chromatography-coupled electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD) (n = 5). Bars indicate the relative abundance of volatile constituents based on GC-MS analysis. The names of antennal active volatiles are highlighted in red. </caption>
