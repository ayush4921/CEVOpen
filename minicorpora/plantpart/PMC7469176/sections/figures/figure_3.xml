  <p>The averaged antennal response (EAD) of female box tree moths (
   <italic>Cydalima perspectalis</italic>) to cinnamon essential oil headspace samples (collected with SPME) measured by gas chromatography coupled electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD) (n = 5). Bars indicate the relative abundance of volatile constituents based on GC-MS analysis. The names of antennal active volatiles are highlighted in red.
