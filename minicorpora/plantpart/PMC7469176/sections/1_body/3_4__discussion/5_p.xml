<p>The results of electrophysiological and behavioural bioassays are strongly dose-dependent [
 <xref rid="B54-insects-11-00465" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], hence we cannot rule out the possibility that other behaviorally active compounds were also present in the EOs, but their abundance was not high enough to elicit distinguishable antennal response. To fully understand the underlying reasons for the observed deterrent effect, we also have to consider the qualitative differences between the antennal active compounds in the three EOs. Our results also highlight the phenomenon that the most abundant components are not always responsible for the behaviour, which has been demonstrated also on 
 <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> (Giles) [
 <xref rid="B55-insects-11-00465" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The long-term stability of EOs—especially if they are exposed to direct sunlight or other environmental factors—is not sufficient for their direct application, as the ratio of behaviourally active components could alter quickly, resulting in the loss of behavioural effect [
 <xref rid="B55-insects-11-00465" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Dispensers containing the key compounds in the optimal dose and composition would be a more reliable alternative for the application in pest management. Therefore, we compared five volatile components (
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene, 
 <italic>cis</italic>-linalool-oxide, terpinolene, linalool, 1-terpinen-4-ol), which gave the highest EAD responses from the three EOs, thus they might play an important role in the deterrent effect. Although the release rate of the five shared, antennal active compounds was not constant, the behavioural effect of the EOs did not change significantly during the bioassay. It is well known that every liquid vaporizes to a different extent until it reaches equilibrium with its vapour above. At equilibrium state, the same number of molecules vaporize into the headspace, as the number of molecules condensing from the headspace into the liquid [
 <xref rid="B56-insects-11-00465" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. However, EOs are highly complex mixtures, constituents with different vapor pressure have a competition to evaporate. Compounds with high vapor pressure are capable of suppressing the vapor pressure of fellow constituents in a closed environment. It is also well accepted that, once deprived of the protective compartmentation in the plant matrix [
 <xref rid="B57-insects-11-00465" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], essential oil constituents especially tend to sustain oxidative damage, chemical transformations or polymerization reactions [
 <xref rid="B58-insects-11-00465" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Thanks to the structural relationship within the same chemical group, essential oil constituents easily convert into each other by oxidation, isomerization, cyclization, dehydrogenation reactions [
 <xref rid="B58-insects-11-00465" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. For instance, terpenoids tend to be both volatile and thermolabile and may be easily oxidized or hydrolyzed depending on their respective structure [
