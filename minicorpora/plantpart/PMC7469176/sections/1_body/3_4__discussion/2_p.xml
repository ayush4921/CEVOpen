<p>In the present study, BTM females laid the fewest eggs on the box tree treated with cinnamon oil, i.e., the cinnamon oil has the highest deterrent effect. In the case of cinnamon oil, the repellent effect has been shown for mites [

 <xref rid="B45-insects-11-00465" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] compared five EOs, and the cinnamon oil was the most repellent oil against cowpea beetle (
 <italic>Callosobruchus maculatus F.</italic>). By using electroantennography (EAG) on the African malaria mosquito (
 <italic>Anopheles gambiae Giles</italic>), the antennae gave the highest response to synthetic cinnamaldehyde, which is the most abundant component in cinnamon oil [
 <xref rid="B46-insects-11-00465" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In our case, trans-cinnamaldehyde was also the most abundant component in cinnamon oil; however, the BTM antennae did not give a distinguishable response to this compound (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-11-00465-f003">Figure 3</xref>), therefore, this component is not necessarily responsible for the deterrent effect shown. In cinnamon oil, the most intensive physiological response was given for benzaldehyde, although it was not the most abundant component in this oil. Ayyub et al. [
 <xref rid="B47-insects-11-00465" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] showed that benzaldehyde, among other aldehydes, had the strongest repellent effect for
