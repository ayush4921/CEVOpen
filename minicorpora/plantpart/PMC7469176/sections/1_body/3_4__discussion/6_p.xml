<p>The equilibrium in an open headspace can also be different from minute to minute and with changes in the composition of these mixtures, the matrix effects can also change. These effects and the interaction can easily account for the observed phenomenon, so that even the same compound can have different emission timespans in different EOs. Our results correspond with Moln√°r et al. [
