The highest deterring effect was observed in the case of cinnamon; about 75% fewer eggs were found on the treated plant as compared to the control. Eucalyptus oil also reduced the number of eggs laid upon treated plants, though to a lesser degree, and lavender caused the lowest effect among the three EOs.
