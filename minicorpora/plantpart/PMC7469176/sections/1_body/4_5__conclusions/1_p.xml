<p>In conclusion, our results show that all three EOs have a significant oviposition-deterring effect. The antennal active compounds should be investigated in order to identify the one or ones that may be responsible for the deterrence and to understand whether the identified volatiles act additively or synergistically, or whether single compounds are already sufficient to deter oviposition. The efficiency of EOs or a synthetic mixture of the identified components should also be confirmed under field conditions. Ultimately, we hope our results may assist in understanding the chemo-ecological characteristics of this invasive moth species and pave the way to developing successful and environmentally sound control methods against BTM—e.g., repellent EOs together with pheromone in a successful push and pull strategy—and preserve the box tree populations in Europe.</p>
