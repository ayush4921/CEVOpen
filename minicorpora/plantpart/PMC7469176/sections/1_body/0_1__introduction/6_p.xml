<p>Our first aim was to assess the repellence of three essential oils selected from different plant families: cinnamon (
 <italic>Cinnamomum verum</italic> Schaeff., Lauraceae), eucalyptus (
 <italic>Eucalyptus globulus</italic> Labill., Myrtaceae), and lavender (
 <italic>Lavandula angustifolia</italic> Mill., Lamiaceae) on BTM females by performing oviposition bioassays in laboratory conditions. Secondly, using gas-chromatography-coupled electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD), we searched for components of the EO headspace that could result in electrophysiological responses by the female BTM antennae. Third, we identified the headspace volatile components of the three EOs with gas-chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Finally, we measured the temporal emission dynamics of dispensers filled with EOs using solvent-free solid phase microextraction (SPME).
