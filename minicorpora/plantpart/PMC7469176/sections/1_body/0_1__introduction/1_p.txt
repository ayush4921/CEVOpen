0: Invasive pests represent a great concern for the native ecosystem on their newly conquered territories.
1: Global trading facilitates the spread of non-native, invasive alien species at an alarming rate [ 1, 2].
2: The box tree moth (BTM) ( Cydalima perspectalis Walker, Lepidoptera: Crambidae) has recently been introduced into Europe and has rapidly become a highly invasive and destructive pest, feeding exclusively on boxwood ( Buxus spp.)
3: and different varieties [ 3, 4, 5, 6].
4: Females lay their eggs on boxwood leaves, and larval feeding may lead to complete defoliation of the shrubs.
5: Besides being a pest of major concern in urban environments all over Europe, in the western, southern and eastern parts of the continent, large areas of natural boxwood forests are also at a severe risk posed by this pest [ 7, 8, 9].
6: Because of its non-native origin, BTM has only a limited number of natural enemies in Europe [ 6].
7: Chemical plant protection is extremely challenging due to the mobility of adults and the hidden lifestyle of the larvae [ 6].
8: The sex-pheromone of the species has already been identified and has proved to be a useful tool for monitoring males [ 10, 11].
9: However, due to the extremely high population density of BTM on the invaded territories even the so-called non saturable, high-capacity funnel traps overflow very quickly, and therefore the maintenance of traps requires intensive manual labour [ 12].
