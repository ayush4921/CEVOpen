<p>The antifeedant effect of EOs was studied against lepidopteran (
 <italic>Trichoplusia ni</italic> Hübn. [
 <xref rid="B23-insects-11-00465" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]) and coleopteran (
 <italic>Leptinotarsa decemlineata</italic> Say) [
 <xref rid="B24-insects-11-00465" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] species, however, contact application on plants is limited due to the phytotoxic properties of EOs. In fumigation, the volatile compounds are responsible for lethality. The fumigant efficiency of different EOs was investigated against storage pests, e.g., towards the rice weevil 
 <italic>Sitophilus oryzae</italic> L. [
 <xref rid="B25-insects-11-00465" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and 
 <italic>Plutella xylostella</italic> L. [
 <xref rid="B26-insects-11-00465" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. To investigate the contact application of EOs regarding their oviposition deterrence, research was concluded e.g., on medfly (
 <italic>Ceratitis capitata</italic> Wiedemann) [
 <xref rid="B27-insects-11-00465" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and on cowpea beetle (
 <italic>Callosobruchus maculatus</italic> F.) [
 <xref rid="B28-insects-11-00465" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Studies were also conducted on lepidopteran species such as 
 <italic>Phthorimaea operculella</italic> Zell. [
 <xref rid="B29-insects-11-00465" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], 
 <italic>Anticarsia gemmatalis</italic> Hübn. [
 <xref rid="B30-insects-11-00465" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], 
 <italic>Spodoptera littoralis</italic> Boisd. [
 <xref rid="B31-insects-11-00465" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], 
 <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic> Smith [
 <xref rid="B32-insects-11-00465" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], and 
 <italic>Tuta absoluta</italic> Meyrick [
 <xref rid="B33-insects-11-00465" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], showing that EOs have the potential to modify the egg-laying behaviour both as contact and as volatile deterrents. Concerning the ovipositing behaviour of BTM, only one study investigated the contact ovipositing deterrent effect of different EOs [
 <xref rid="B34-insects-11-00465" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].
