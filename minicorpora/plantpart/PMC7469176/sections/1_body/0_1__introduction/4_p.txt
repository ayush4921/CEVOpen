0: The antifeedant effect of EOs was studied against lepidopteran ( Trichoplusia ni Hubn.
1: [ 23]) and coleopteran ( Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say) [ 24] species, however, contact application on plants is limited due to the phytotoxic properties of EOs.
2: In fumigation, the volatile compounds are responsible for lethality.
3: The fumigant efficiency of different EOs was investigated against storage pests, e.g., towards the rice weevil  Sitophilus oryzae L. [ 25] and  Plutella xylostella L. [ 26].
4: To investigate the contact application of EOs regarding their oviposition deterrence, research was concluded e.g., on medfly ( Ceratitis capitata Wiedemann) [ 27] and on cowpea beetle ( Callosobruchus maculatus F.) [ 28].
5: Studies were also conducted on lepidopteran species such as  Phthorimaea operculella Zell.
6: [ 29],  Anticarsia gemmatalis Hubn.
7: [ 30],  Spodoptera littoralis Boisd.
8: [ 31],  Spodoptera frugiperda Smith [ 32], and  Tuta absoluta Meyrick [ 33], showing that EOs have the potential to modify the egg-laying behaviour both as contact and as volatile deterrents.
9: Concerning the ovipositing behaviour of BTM, only one study investigated the contact ovipositing deterrent effect of different EOs [ 34].
