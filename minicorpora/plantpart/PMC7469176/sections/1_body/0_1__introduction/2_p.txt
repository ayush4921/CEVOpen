0: Repellents act locally or at a distance, preventing arthropods from flying toward, landing upon, or feeding on the host [ 13].
1: Usually, insect repellents work by providing a vapour barrier around the host, deterring the arthropod from coming into contact with the plant surface [ 14].
2: Therefore, deterring egg-laying by BTM females by the application of natural repellents would be an environmentally sound pest control tactic.
3: To date, three volatile components of the BTM larval frass have been identified as potential oviposition-deterrents.
4: Although the synthetic blend of these three compounds significantly reduced the number of laid eggs, it did not completely prevent the oviposition and the damage [ 15].
