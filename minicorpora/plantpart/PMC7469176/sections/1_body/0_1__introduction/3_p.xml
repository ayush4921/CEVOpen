<p>For potential sources of repellents, thousands of plants have been screened in the last 50 years [
 <xref rid="B16-insects-11-00465" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and recently essential oils (EOs) became the focus of attention. These concentrated hydrophobic liquids can be isolated from a vast array of plants, and the composition highly depends on the genotype [
 <xref rid="B17-insects-11-00465" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], on the phenological stage [
 <xref rid="B18-insects-11-00465" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], on the harvested plant part [
 <xref rid="B19-insects-11-00465" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and on the extraction method [
 <xref rid="B20-insects-11-00465" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The volatile components are biosynthesized in different pathways, so they belong to polyketides and lipids, shikimic acid derivatives and terpenoids (hemi-, mono, sesquiterpenoids) [
 <xref rid="B16-insects-11-00465" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-insects-11-00465" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. These complex mixtures may contain over 300 different compounds [
 <xref rid="B21-insects-11-00465" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], generally with low molecular weight [
 <xref rid="B22-insects-11-00465" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In spite of their complexity, most of the EOs are dominated by two or three major components while the rest of the compounds are present only in trace amounts [
 <xref rid="B17-insects-11-00465" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].
