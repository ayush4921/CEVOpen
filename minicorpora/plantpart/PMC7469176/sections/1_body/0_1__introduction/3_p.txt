0: For potential sources of repellents, thousands of plants have been screened in the last 50 years [ 16], and recently essential oils (EOs) became the focus of attention.
1: These concentrated hydrophobic liquids can be isolated from a vast array of plants, and the composition highly depends on the genotype [ 17], on the phenological stage [ 18], on the harvested plant part [ 19] and on the extraction method [ 20].
2: The volatile components are biosynthesized in different pathways, so they belong to polyketides and lipids, shikimic acid derivatives and terpenoids (hemi-, mono, sesquiterpenoids) [ 16, 17].
3: These complex mixtures may contain over 300 different compounds [ 21], generally with low molecular weight [ 22].
4: In spite of their complexity, most of the EOs are dominated by two or three major components while the rest of the compounds are present only in trace amounts [ 17].
