0: Our first aim was to assess the repellence of three essential oils selected from different plant families: cinnamon ( Cinnamomum verum Schaeff., Lauraceae), eucalyptus ( Eucalyptus globulus Labill., Myrtaceae), and lavender ( Lavandula angustifolia Mill., Lamiaceae) on BTM females by performing oviposition bioassays in laboratory conditions.
1: Secondly, using gas-chromatography-coupled electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD), we searched for components of the EO headspace that could result in electrophysiological responses by the female BTM antennae.
2: Third, we identified the headspace volatile components of the three EOs with gas-chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry (GC-MS).
3: Finally, we measured the temporal emission dynamics of dispensers filled with EOs using solvent-free solid phase microextraction (SPME).
