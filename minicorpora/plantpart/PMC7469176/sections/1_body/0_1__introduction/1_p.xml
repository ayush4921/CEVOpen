<p>Invasive pests represent a great concern for the native ecosystem on their newly conquered territories. Global trading facilitates the spread of non-native, invasive alien species at an alarming rate [

 <xref rid="B2-insects-11-00465" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The box tree moth (BTM) (
 <italic>Cydalima perspectalis</italic> Walker, Lepidoptera: Crambidae) has recently been introduced into Europe and has rapidly become a highly invasive and destructive pest, feeding exclusively on boxwood (
 <italic>Buxus</italic> spp.) and different varieties [

 <xref rid="B4-insects-11-00465" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5-insects-11-00465" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-insects-11-00465" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Females lay their eggs on boxwood leaves, and larval feeding may lead to complete defoliation of the shrubs. Besides being a pest of major concern in urban environments all over Europe, in the western, southern and eastern parts of the continent, large areas of natural boxwood forests are also at a severe risk posed by this pest [

 <xref rid="B9-insects-11-00465" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Because of its non-native origin, BTM has only a limited number of natural enemies in Europe [
 <xref rid="B6-insects-11-00465" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Chemical plant protection is extremely challenging due to the mobility of adults and the hidden lifestyle of the larvae [
 <xref rid="B6-insects-11-00465" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The sex-pheromone of the species has already been identified and has proved to be a useful tool for monitoring males [

 <xref rid="B11-insects-11-00465" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, due to the extremely high population density of BTM on the invaded territories even the so-called non saturable, high-capacity funnel traps overflow very quickly, and therefore the maintenance of traps requires intensive manual labour [
