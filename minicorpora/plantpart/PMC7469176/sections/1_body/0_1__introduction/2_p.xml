<p>Repellents act locally or at a distance, preventing arthropods from flying toward, landing upon, or feeding on the host [

Therefore, deterring egg-laying by BTM females by the application of natural repellents would be an environmentally sound pest control tactic. To date, three volatile components of the BTM larval frass have been identified as potential oviposition-deterrents. Although the synthetic blend of these three compounds significantly reduced the number of laid eggs, it did not completely prevent the oviposition and the damage [
