<p>Volatile headspace collections were conducted from the three above-mentioned commercially available undiluted essential oils, as were tested in oviposition bioassay. A total of 5 µL of the essential oil was pipetted into 4 mL vials and closed with a screw cap equipped with PTFE/silicone septa. After 10 min, the SPME fiber (DVB/CAR/PDMS 50/30 µm, Supelco, Sigma-Aldrich, Bellefonte, PA, USA) was pierced through the septum and exposed to the headspace of the sampling vial for 5 min at room temperature (20 ± 1 °C) in three replicates. The SPME fiber was placed into the GC-MS (HP Agilent 6890 GC and 5975 MS, Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, USA) injector port for thermal desorption. The injector temperature was set to 250 °C in splitless mode and the split valve was closed for 1 min before septum purge. The GC was equipped with HP-5 UI capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 µm, J&amp;W Scientific, Folsom, CA, USA). Helium was used as the carrier at 35 cm s
 <sup>−1</sup> flow. The oven temperature was initially held at 50 °C for 1 min, then raised to 260 °C at 10 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup>, where it was held for 10 min. The transfer line temperature was 280 °C. The mass spectrometer was operated in electron impact (EI) ionization mode at 70 eV, scanning m/z 29–400, at 2 scans s
 <sup>−1</sup>. Before each measurement, fibers were conditioned at 250 °C in the split/splitless injector of the GC-MS in split mode for 10 min.
