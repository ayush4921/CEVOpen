<p>Compounds were tentatively identified by matching their mass spectra with those in the MS Libraries (NIST 11 and Wiley) and the identification was verified by the comparison of calculated Kov√°ts index (Ki) values with those published in NIST Chemistry WebBook database. For performing statistical analysis and calculating relative abundances, manually integrated areas from the total ion chromatogram adapted to the baseline were used.</p>
