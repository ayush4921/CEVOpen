<p>The release rate of the dispensers loaded with EOs was measured on a daily basis for five consecutive days to mirror the duration of the oviposition bioassay. Three independent dispensers were measured for each EO. The headspace of EOs was sampled with SPME fibers, as described above. Prior to sampling, the vial-wick dispensers filled with 1.5 mL of EO were placed in glass vials (L: 80 mm, ID 20 mm), and 5 min before sampling the vials were sealed with aluminium foil and laboratory film (American Can, Greenwich, CT, USA). The SPME fibers were exposed to the closed headspace of the sampling vial for 5 min at room temperature and subsequently analyzed by GC-MS. The abundance of antennal active volatile compounds shared among tested EOs was monitored: 1-terpinen-4-ol, 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene, 
 <italic>cis</italic>-linalool oxide, (±)-linalool and terpinolene. Before each measurement, fibers were conditioned at 250 °C in the split/splitless injector of the GC-MS (HP Agilent 5890 GC and 5975 MS, Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, USA) in split mode for 10 min.
