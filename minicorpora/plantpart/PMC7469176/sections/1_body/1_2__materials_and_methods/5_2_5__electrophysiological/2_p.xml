<p>Headspace SPME volatile collection was injected into the GC. The antennal signal was pre-amplified 10 times, converted to a digital signal by a high-input impedance DC amplifier interface (IDAC-2, Syntech) and recorded simultaneously with the FID signal on a computer using a GC-EAD 2012 software (version 1.2.4, Syntech). Experiments were designed with five replicates of each essential oil.</p>
