<p>Coupled gas chromatographic–electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD) was performed on female box tree moths following the procedure described by Molnár et al. [
 <xref rid="B38-insects-11-00465" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Briefly, two-day-old mated female antennae were used to pinpoint the antennal active volatile components of the three essential oils. The GC was equipped with an HP-5 capillary column (30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.25 µm, J&amp;W Scientific) and was used with a split/splitless injector. The injector was used in splitless mode for 0.5 min at a temperature of 270 °C. The oven temperature was held at 50 °C for 1 min and then increased by 10 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup> up to 230 °C. Helium was used as the carrier at a constant flow rate of 2.9 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup>. The GC effluent was equally split to the FID (280 °C) and to the heated EAD port (220 °C). The EAD effluent was delivered into a stream of charcoal-filtered and humidified air (1 L min
 <sup>−1</sup>) and led to the antennal preparation.
