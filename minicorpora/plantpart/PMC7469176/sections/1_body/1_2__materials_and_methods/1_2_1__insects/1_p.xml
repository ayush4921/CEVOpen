<p>Box tree moths were collected in an early larval stage from public gardens at different locations of Budapest, Hungary. The larvae were kept in a climate chamber (25 ± 1 °C, 65 ± 5% RH, with a photoperiod of 16L:8D) to establish a laboratory colony. Larvae were fed on 5–7 boxwood shoots placed in cylindrical glass jars (I.D. 20 × 100 cm) equipped with small dishes containing water. For the experiments, the pupae were collected and sexed. For experimenting, male and female pupae were placed in separate rearing cages covered with mesh until emergence. For rearing, male and female pupae were left to emerge together and potted boxwood plants were offered for egg-laying. Leaves with eggs were replaced into cylindrical glass jars, as described above, where boxwood shoots were offered for the hatching larvae to feed upon and develop.</p>
