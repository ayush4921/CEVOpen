<p>To determine the behavioural effect of EOs on female oviposition, the bioassays were conducted in parallel in two screened cages with polyester netting (100 × 100 × 100 cm) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-11-00465-f001">Figure 1</xref>) in a climate room (25 °C, 60% RH, 16L:8D). One day prior to the experiment, two boxwood plants (
 <italic>Buxus sempervirens</italic> L. ‘Suffruticosa’) were placed into the cage. The plants were of the same variety, age, size and phenological stage, and potted in the same type of two-liter nursery container. The offered boxwood variety has dense foliage and a naturally spherical shape; the average height and width of the plants were 32 and 28 cm, respectively. Each plant was equipped with three vial-wick dispensers. Vials were placed at the bottom, middle and upper part of the plants (as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-11-00465-f001">Figure 1</xref>). After this procedure, 5-5 freshly emerged male and female moths were released in the cages. The position of the plants within the cages was rotated randomly once a day.
