<p>Because of the high volatility, potential cytotoxicity and/or phytotoxicity (herbicide) of EO components on plant cells [

 <xref rid="B36-insects-11-00465" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], EOs were not sprayed directly onto the foliage of boxwood. Instead, vial-wick dispensers were hung onto the shoots and used during the oviposition bioassays. Vial- wick dispensers were made using amber glass vials (2 mL) with open-top caps. Through a hole in the PTFE/silicone septa, the top of a PTFE tube (I.D. 2 mm, length 40 mm) with a cotton wick (total length 50 mm) was exposed to the air by 4 mm, while the other end was dipped into the essential oil (1.5 mL) inside the vial [
