<p>Our study showed that different parts of 
 <italic>Eryngium</italic> species from intact plants and in vitro shoot cultures showed different yields and compositions of the essential oils. Comparing the volatile constituents of 
 <italic>E. maritimum</italic>, 
 <italic>E. alpinum</italic>, and other 
 <italic>Eryngium</italic> species, it can be stated that there is a group of compounds that are common for the majority of the essential oils. Among them there are mono- and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, and especially germacrene D, widespread as the components of the essential oils as well as compounds rarely found in the essential oils such as 
 <italic>cis</italic>-chrysanthenyl acetate, trimethylbenzaledydes, and falcarinol. Our study on the essential oil composition of 
 <italic>E. maritimum</italic> and 
 <italic>E. alpinum</italic> has completed the existing knowledge on this subject. It was shown that in vitro shoot culture of 
 <italic>E. maritimum</italic> produced the essential oil with the composition similar to the composition of the intact plant and 
 <italic>E. alpinum</italic> basal leaves and shoot culture gave significantly different essential oils. Thus, in vitro cultures of these endangered and protected species can be the alternative source of the raw material for phytochemical examination and the biological activity studies. In addition, this has been the first report on the content and the composition of the essential oils from 
 <italic>Eryngium</italic> species growing in Poland. The essential oils obtained from 
 <italic>E. maritimum</italic> fruits and basal leaves of the intact plant were the most active against dermatophyte fungus 
 <italic>T. mentagophytes</italic> and Gram-positive bacterium 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Moreover, the essential oil of basal leaves had also the moderate activity against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> and Gram-negative 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>.
