<p>The aim of this work was to study the chemical composition of the essential oils obtained from different parts of the intact plants as well as in vitro shoot cultures of 
 <italic>E. maritimum</italic> L. and 
 <italic>E. alpinum</italic> L., and to screen the antimicrobial activity of the essential oils obtained from mature fruits and basal leaves of the 
 <italic>E. maritimum</italic> intact plant against Gram-positive bacterium 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, Gram-negative bacterium 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, yeast 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, and dermatophyte fungus 
 <italic>Trichophyton mentagrophytes</italic>. Our study on the essential oil composition of 
 <italic>E. maritimum</italic> has completed the existing knowledge on this subject and supplemented the raw materials not yet tested, and thus not characterized, especially those obtained by the biotechnological methods under controlled conditions. In addition, our study has provided the first preliminary results of the analysis of the 
 <italic>E. alpinum</italic> essential oil from the raw materials obtained from the intact plant and biomass from in vitro culture. Thus, in vitro cultures of these endangered and protected species can be the alternative source of the raw material for phytochemical examination and the biological activity studies. In addition, this has been the first report on the content and the composition of the essential oils from 
 <italic>Eryngium</italic> species growing in Polandâ€”
 <italic>E. maritimum</italic> on Polish beaches and 
 <italic>E. alpinum</italic> in a botanical garden.
