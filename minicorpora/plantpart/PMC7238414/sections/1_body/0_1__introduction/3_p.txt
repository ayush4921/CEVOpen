0: E. alpinum L. (Alpine eryngo) is also under strict law protection in the European countries.
1: It is a perennial species that can be found across the European Alps, at the altitudes between 1500 and 2000 m a.s.l.
2: [ 20].
3: The phytochemical investigations of  E. alpinum revealed the presence of secondary metabolitestriterpenoid saponins [ 21], phenolic acids mainly caffeic acid, rosmarinic acid and its derivative R-(+)-3- O-- d-glucopyranosyl rosmarinic acid, chlorogenic, iso- and neochlorogenic acids, and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid [ 21, 22, 23], flavonoidskaempferol, quercetin, and isoquercetin [ 21, 23, 24], and the essential oil [ 25].
4: The analysis of the essential oil of the  E. alpinum aboveground part performed by Dunkic et al.
5: [ 25], showed the presence of oxygenated sesquiterpenes, sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, oxygenated monoterpenes, and monoterpene hydrocarbons.
6: Falcarinol was also found by Hegenauer [ 26, 27].
7: To our knowledge, basal leaves as well as biomass from in vitro shoot culture of this species have never been investigated for the presence and the composition of the essential oil.
