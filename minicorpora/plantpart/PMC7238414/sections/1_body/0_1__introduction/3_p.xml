 <italic>E. alpinum</italic> L. (Alpine eryngo) is also under strict law protection in the European countries. It is a perennial species that can be found across the European Alps, at the altitudes between 1500 and 2000 m a.s.l. [
 <xref rid="B20-plants-09-00417" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The phytochemical investigations of 
 <italic>E. alpinum</italic> revealed the presence of secondary metabolites—triterpenoid saponins [
 <xref rid="B21-plants-09-00417" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], phenolic acids mainly caffeic acid, rosmarinic acid and its derivative R-(+)-3’-
 <italic>O</italic>-β-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucopyranosyl rosmarinic acid, chlorogenic, iso- and neochlorogenic acids, and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid [

 <italic>E. alpinum</italic> aboveground part performed by Dunkić et al. [
 <xref rid="B25-plants-09-00417" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], showed the presence of oxygenated sesquiterpenes, sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, oxygenated monoterpenes, and monoterpene hydrocarbons. Falcarinol was also found by Hegenauer [

 <xref rid="B27-plants-09-00417" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. To our knowledge, basal leaves as well as biomass from in vitro shoot culture of this species have never been investigated for the presence and the composition of the essential oil.
