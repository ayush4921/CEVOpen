<p>The GC-FID-MS analyses were performed using the Trace GC Ultra apparatus (Thermo Electron Corporation, Waltham, MA, USA) with FID and MS DSQ II detectors and the FID-MS splitter (SGE). Operating conditions: apolar capillary column Rtx-1ms (Restek), 60 m × 0.25 mm i.d., film thickness 0.25 µm; temperature program, 50–300 °C at 4 °C/min; SSL injector temperature 280 °C; FID temperature 300 °C; split ratio 1:20; carrier gas helium at a regular pressure 200 kPa. Mass spectra were acquired over the mass range 30–400 Da, ionization voltage 70 eV; ion source temperature 200 °C.</p>
