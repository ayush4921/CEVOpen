<p>The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the essential oils was determined by employing the broth microdilution method in 96-well plates following EUCAST with some modifications for essential oils [
 <xref rid="B43-plants-09-00417" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. One hundred microliters of each dilution of the essential oil and sterile nutrient broth (for growth control) were distributed into the wells of the micro titer plates. Each well was inoculated with 100 ÂµL of a microbial suspension. The final concentration of microorganisms was determined for all the strains by subculture of the growth control on TSA (bacteria) and SDA (fungi) plates.
