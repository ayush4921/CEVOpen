<p>The dominant constituents of the 
 <italic>E. alpinum</italic> essential oils were sesquiterpenes, both hydrocarbons and oxygenated derivatives. Although leaf and in vitro shoot oils have numerous common components, they differed significantly. The main components of the leaf oil were β-elemenone (10.3%), germacrone (5.8%), two selinadienes (7.1% and 6.7%), and 1,8-cineole (5.3%) that were not found in the in vitro shoot oil. On the other hand, the in vitro shoot oil was dominated by hexadecanoic acid (15.5%), spathulenol (7.5%), germacra-4(15), 5,10(14)-trien-1α-ol (4.7%), (
 <italic>E</italic>)-β-farnesene (4.9%), and falcarinol (4.3%). Each of these components was present in the leaf oil, however, in a smaller amount. In respect to the presence of the four mentioned sesquiterpenes (ketones and selinadienes), (
 <italic>E</italic>)-nerolidol, and the low content of germacrene D (1.7%), the leaf oil of 
 <italic>E. alpinum</italic> resembled the in vitro shoot oil of 
 <italic>E. maritimum</italic> (

The composition of the leaf essential oil is quite different than that previously reported for the aerial part oil, which contained caryophyllene oxide (21.6%), bicyclogermacrene (11.8%), germacrene D (10.3%), and α-bisabolol (7.8%) [
