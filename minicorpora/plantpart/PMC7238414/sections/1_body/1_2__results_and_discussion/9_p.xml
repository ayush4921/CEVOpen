<p>The study on the essential oil composition is a part of a bigger project aiming at phytochemical screening of 
 <italic>Eryngium</italic> species: protected 
 <italic>E. maritimum</italic> and 
 <italic>E. alpinum</italic> as well as rare 
 <italic>E. planum</italic> and 
 <italic>E. campestre</italic>. In comparison with our previous investigation on the essential oils from different parts (inflorescence, stalk leaves, rosette leaves, and roots) as well as shoot in vitro culture of 
 <italic>E. planum</italic>, some differences were observed between the aerial part, root, and in vitro shoot oils [

 <italic>E. maritimum</italic> and 
 <italic>E. alpinum</italic> have been comparatively analyzed. It should be pointed out that the composition of the essential oil produced by in vitro shoot culture of 
 <italic>E. maritimum</italic> (

 <italic>E. planum</italic> [
