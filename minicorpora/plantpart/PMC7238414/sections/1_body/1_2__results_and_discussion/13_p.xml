<p>The antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic>E. maritimum</italic> as well as 
 <italic>E. planum</italic> and 
 <italic>E. campestre</italic> has been already studied [

 <xref rid="B37-plants-09-00417" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. However, it was the extracts and their fractions that were examined, not the essential oils. The crude ethanolic extracts of both leaves and roots of investigated 
 <italic>E. maritimum</italic> showed the significant antifungal activity against 
 <italic>T. mentagrophytes</italic> and the moderate antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B36-plants-09-00417" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This observation was in a great agreement with the study of Kholkhal [
 <xref rid="B8-plants-09-00417" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], who showed the moderate antibacterial activity of the methanolic extract from the 
 <italic>E. maritimum</italic> root against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. The methanolic extract of roots and saponin-phenolic acid fraction of this extract were the most active against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> [
 <xref rid="B37-plants-09-00417" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The results of Meot-Duros studies on the 
 <italic>E. maritimum</italic> antimicrobial activity of the leaf hydromethanolic extracts, measured by microdilution method, showed that apolar fractions were more active than polar fractions. The antibacterial activity of apolar fraction against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> showed MIC value of 10 µg/mL and the antifungal activity of apolar fraction against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> showed MIC value of 100 µg/mL, while polar fractions had no antimicrobial activity. Moreover, both apolar and polar fractions were not sensitive to 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> [
