<p>The interest in the essential oils obtained from the 
 <italic>Eryngium</italic> taxa has been increasing since some of the constituents and the essential oils showed the antimicrobial activities, for example 
 <italic>E. creticum</italic>, 
 <italic>E. campestre</italic>, 
 <italic>E. thorifolium</italic>, and 
 <italic>E. duriaei</italic> [

 <italic>E. thorifolium</italic>, rich in Î±-pinene, showed the antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> with the inhibition zone ranging from 13 to 19 mm, which referred to sensitivity of the test microorganisms [

 <italic>E. duriaei</italic> revealed the antifungal activity against 
 <italic>T. mentagrophytes</italic>, which was probably related to the caryophyllene derived compounds [
