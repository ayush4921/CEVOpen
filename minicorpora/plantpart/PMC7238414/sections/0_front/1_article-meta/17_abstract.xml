 <p>In the present study, the essential oils obtained by hydrodistillation of the organs of 
  <italic>Eryngium maritimum</italic> and 
  <italic>E. alpinum</italic> were analyzed by GC-FID-MS. The dominant constituents assessed in the essential oil of 
  <italic>E. maritimum</italic> were germacrene D (45.2%) in the fruits; hexadecanoic acid (18.5%), menthol (16.8%), and menthone (10.9%) in the roots; 2,3,4-trimethylbenzaldehyde (11.3%) and germacrene D (10.5%) in the leaves; 2,3,4-trimethylbenzaldehyde (11.3%) in the shoot culture. In the case of 
  <italic>E. alpinum</italic>, the main components of the leaf oil were: β-elemenone (10.3%), germacrone (5.8%), two selinadienes (7.1% and 6.7%), and 1,8-cineole (5.3%), which were not found in the oil from shoot culture, whereas the shoot culture oil was dominated by hexadecanoic acid (15.5%), spathulenol (7.5%), (
  <italic>E</italic>)-β-farnesene (4.9%), germacra-4(15),5,10(14)-trien-1α-ol (4.7%), and falcarinol (4.3%). The essential oils obtained from 
  <italic>E. maritimum</italic> fruits and leaves of the intact plants, measured by the broth microdilution method, were the most active against 
  <italic>T. mentagophytes</italic> and 
  <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Moreover, the essential oil of leaves had the moderate activity against 
  <italic>C. albicans</italic> and 
  <italic>E. coli</italic>. The results showed that the chemical compositions of the essential oils differed decidedly between the two studied species and between the organs. Furthermore, the essential oil of 
  <italic>E. maritimum</italic> may play an important role as antimicrobial agent.
