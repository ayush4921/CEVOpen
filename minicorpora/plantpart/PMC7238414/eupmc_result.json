    "In the present study, the essential oils obtained by hydrodistillation of the organs of <i>Eryngium maritimum</i> and <i>E. alpinum</i> were analyzed by GC-FID-MS. The dominant constituents assessed in the essential oil of <i>E. maritimum</i> were germacrene D (45.2%) in the fruits; hexadecanoic acid (18.5%), menthol (16.8%), and menthone (10.9%) in the roots; 2,3,4-trimethylbenzaldehyde (11.3%) and germacrene D (10.5%) in the leaves; 2,3,4-trimethylbenzaldehyde (11.3%) in the shoot culture. In the case of <i>E. alpinum</i>, the main components of the leaf oil were: β-elemenone (10.3%), germacrone (5.8%), two selinadienes (7.1% and 6.7%), and 1,8-cineole (5.3%), which were not found in the oil from shoot culture, whereas the shoot culture oil was dominated by hexadecanoic acid (15.5%), spathulenol (7.5%), (<i>E</i>)-β-farnesene (4.9%), germacra-4(15),5,10(14)-trien-1α-ol (4.7%), and falcarinol (4.3%). The essential oils obtained from <i>E. maritimum</i> fruits and leaves of the intact plants, measured by the broth microdilution method, were the most active against <i>T. mentagophytes</i> and <i>S. aureus</i>. Moreover, the essential oil of leaves had the moderate activity against <i>C. albicans</i> and <i>E. coli</i>. The results showed that the chemical compositions of the essential oils differed decidedly between the two studied species and between the organs. Furthermore, the essential oil of <i>E. maritimum</i> may play an important role as antimicrobial agent."
