 <xref rid="B82-plants-10-00044" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>] has shown many advantages for the extraction of essential oils on an industrial scale, including the reduction of extraction times, higher quality extracts and, principally, the use of carbon dioxide (CO
 <sub>2</sub>) as a nontoxic, non-flammable and free-of-residues solvent [

 <xref rid="B85-plants-10-00044" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. In relation to turmeric, superior yields but no significant differences in the relative composition or higher concentrations of most of the essential oil components [
 <xref rid="B79-plants-10-00044" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>] were obtained using SFE rather than the conventional systems of steam distillation and ultrasound extraction. However, the turmeric oil yield was higher with Soxhlet extraction than SFE [

 <xref rid="B89-plants-10-00044" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Similar optimal conditions to obtain the highest-quality essential oils from turmeric rhizomes (75% of ar-, α- and β-turmerone) were reported by Carvalho et al. (333 K and 25 MPa) [
 <xref rid="B90-plants-10-00044" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Nevertheless, this technique is still under study to achieve a higher optimization. The influence of the variation of different operating parameters (temperature, extraction time, pressure, solubility and particle size) together with the integration of other techniques, such as SFE assisted by pressing (SFEAP), are investigated to reach higher yields, the quality of turmeric essential oil and its main compounds [
