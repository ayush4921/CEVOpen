0: Medicinal and aromatic plant species (MAPs) have been broadly exploited as food flavourings, medicinal agents, preservatives and ornaments, as well as beauty and personal delight products, becoming natural alternatives that offer reliability, safety and sustainability [ 1, 2].
1: Amongst them, turmeric ( Curcuma longa L.,  Zingiberaceae) is especially popular worldwide because of its attractive culinary, cosmetic and medicinal uses [ 3].
2: Specifically, the interest of this tuberous species resides in its exploitation as a colouring and flavouring agent, as well as in its numerous pharmacological activities, such as antioxidant, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, neuro- and dermoprotective, antiasthmatic or hypoglycaemic [ 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], being recently reported that turmeric can even potentially contribute against the life-threatening viral disease COVID-19 by inhibiting the main protease enzyme [ 11].
3: Most of these interesting features and properties principally come from the rhizome [ 3, 12], a horizontal underground stem from which the shoots and roots arise [ 13].
4: It has distinctive organoleptic properties: a yellow/brown colour externally, with a deep orange inner part, a special aromatic smell and a bitter, hot taste.
5: These characteristics make  C. longa rhizome ideal for gastronomy.
6: Especially, it is the principal ingredient of curry, for which it is probably popularly known [ 14, 15, 16].
