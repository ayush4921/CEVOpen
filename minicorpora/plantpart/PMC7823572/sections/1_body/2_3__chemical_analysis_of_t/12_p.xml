<p>In conclusion, the study of the chemical composition of the essential oil from the rhizome of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> gives us an idea of the characteristics and possible properties that it possesses. Sesquiterpenes are usually the main compounds in 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> rhizome essential oil, highlighting the oxygenated turmerones followed by sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (

However, the qualitative and quantitative chemical compositions of the essential oil can vary depending on the genetic and commented on factors. The knowledge of these can help to achieve a high-yield product with useful composition and properties for the agri-food industry.
