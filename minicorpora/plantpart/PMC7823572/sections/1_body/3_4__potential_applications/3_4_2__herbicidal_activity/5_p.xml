<p>On the other hand, other products derived from 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> have demonstrated phytotoxic activity. In this way, the ethanolic extract completely inhibited the growth of the floating weed common duckweed (
 <italic>Lemna minor</italic> (L.) Griff.) at 100 and 1000 µg/mL [
 <xref rid="B240-plants-10-00044" ref-type="bibr">240</xref>], whereas the ethyl acetate extract (1000–10,000 ppm) showed the highest inhibitory effect vs. the seed germination and seedling growth of radishes in comparison to cyclohexane and 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane, which stimulated germination and elongation at 10,000 and 7500 ppm, respectively [
 <xref rid="B241-plants-10-00044" ref-type="bibr">241</xref>]; more recently, Akter et al. remarked on the potent inhibitory effect of the methanolic extract against the seed germination and seedling growth of both weed beggarticks (
 <italic>Bidens pilosa</italic> L.) and crops cress, radishes and lettuce. Especially, the major curcuminoids present in 
 <italic>C. longa</italic>’s Ryudai gold variety strongly reduced the seed germination, as well as root and shoot growth of the weed (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 8.7–12.9 and 15.5–38.9 µmol/L, respectively) [
