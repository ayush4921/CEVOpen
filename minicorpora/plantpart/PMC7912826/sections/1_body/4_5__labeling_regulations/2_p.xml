<p>There have been proposals to better regulate labels on meat-free plant-based alternatives to avoid confusion among consumers. A recent example is the proposal to the European Parliament to reserve the use of terms like “burger”, “sausage”, “scallop” or “steak” exclusively for products containing meat [

In opposition to these proposals, it has been argued that current labeling is not misleading and the use of meat terms are useful to set up expectations. Certain labels like “sausage” or “nuggets” inform the consumer the type of meat the product is trying to mimic and the kind of sensory properties that should be expected from that product.
