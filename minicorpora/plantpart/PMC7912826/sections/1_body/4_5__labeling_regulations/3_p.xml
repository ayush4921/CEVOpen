<p>Dairy alternatives, especially milk, have harsher legislation barriers than meat alternative products, concerning the use of dairy terms. To use such names, like “milk”, a product must comply with the legal description of what “milk” is. Because milk is described as “mammary secretion obtained from one or more milking”, plant-based milk alternatives cannot be described (labeled) as “milk”. Under these laws, plant-based products cannot use protected dairy terms laid down in Annex VII of Regulation (EU) 1308/2013 [

Contrary to meat products, dairy contains a long list of reserved names in different languages, exclusively for milk products, including whey, cream, butter, buttermilk, butter oil, caseins, anhydrous milk fat (AMF), cheese, yogurt, kefir, koumiss, viili/fil, smetana, fil, rjaženka and rūgušpiens. To complicate things further, EU Member states have approved exemptions in their national language, allowing certain terms that are not allowed in other countries [
