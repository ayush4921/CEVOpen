<p>Egg alternatives are used instead of eggs in recipes by consumers following a vegan diet or individuals with egg allergy. While other products such as meat alternatives aim to replicate the sensory qualities and experience of consuming the original product, the main objective of the egg alternative is to replace the functional properties of egg protein (solubility, emulsification, foaming and gelling) for backing and cooking. “Vegan mayonnaise” is the most tested product in studies on the effectiveness of vegetable ingredients to substitute the egg’s properties. Preparation of cholesterol-free and modified lipid versions of such products is also of interest.</p>
