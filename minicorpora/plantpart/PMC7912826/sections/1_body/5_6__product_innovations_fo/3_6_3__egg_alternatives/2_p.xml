<p>Söderberg [
 <xref rid="B51-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] investigated the use of soy and pea protein to substitute egg protein and found that both soy and pea protein have properties that are similar to that of egg, although pea protein showed poor gelling properties. Furthermore, according to the protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score (PDCAAS), soy was found to have similar protein quality to egg, but pea protein was found to be incomplete. In order for pea protein to become complete, the complementarity concept in terms of amino acid composition between different plant protein sources may be used (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec4dot3dot1-foods-10-00293">Section 4.3.1</xref>.). Another aspect that should be taken into account is that soy and pea protein have distinct flavors due to their content in saponins, ketones and aldehyde compounds. These flavors are often described as “beany” or “green” and can be off-putting to the consumer.
