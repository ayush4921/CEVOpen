Although there is an ample list of ingredients that can emulate eggs when cooking, the nutritional value of these ingredients must be taken into account. Protein rich foods like legumes can offer similar protein content, while other ingredients contain only marginal protein. If protein content differs notably, consumers must be mindful to avoid nutritional deficiencies from regular consumption of egg alternatives with insufficient protein content.
