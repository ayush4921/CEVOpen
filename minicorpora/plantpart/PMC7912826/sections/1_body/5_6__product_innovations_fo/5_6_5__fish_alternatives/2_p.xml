<p>The issue with some current fish alternatives is that they do not provide any of the nutritional benefits of fish and seafood consumption. In this regard, neither tofu nor seitan are sources of EPA and DHA, and other fish alternatives made from vegetables do not provide protein or omega-3 FAs. In vegan and vegetarian recipes, mushrooms are sometimes used as substitutes for seafood, peeled and marinated tomatoes and carrots have been proposed as marinated tuna, and salmon, respectively. Although these are clever imitations that emulate sensory properties, they should be improved to achieve an adequate nutritional profile.</p>
