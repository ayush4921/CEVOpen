<p>Cultured meat has been presented earlier as one of the newest alternatives to livestock meat. This alternative has been proposed as a more sustainable source of meat than livestock, although the environmental impact of large-scale cultured meat production is still unclear. Cultured meat has been estimated to reduce land use by 99% for its production compared to livestock meat production. Nevertheless, other energy needs and a strict hygiene installation required for the production of cultured meat makes it inefficient in terms of energy, water and feedstock expenditure [
