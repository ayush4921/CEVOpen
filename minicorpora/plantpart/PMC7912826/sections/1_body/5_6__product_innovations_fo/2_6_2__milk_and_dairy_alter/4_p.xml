<p>In Western countries, the production of cheese analogs involves the use of fat and/or protein sources other than those from cow’s milk, together with flavors that resemble as closely as possible those of the original product. It is important to note that cheese analogs can completely exclude milk and milk products (vegan) or partially contain milk or milk components (e.g., casein, butter oil, etc.) together with coconut or soybean extract [

In cheese analogs, the milk protein and milk fat are partly or totally replaced by vegetable proteins (i.e., peanut protein, soybean protein) and vegetable fats and oils (i.e., partly hydrogenated vegetable fat like soybean, palm, etc.). Cheese analogs have been consumed for decades, mainly used in pizza as cheaper alternatives to cut production costs. Still, the difficulties of reproducing the unique flavors of different types of cheese is what has prevented the use of cheese analogs as “cheese board” products for many years [
