<p>Fermentation with two or more microorganisms can improve plant protein solubility and amino acid composition and availability. For example, 
 <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> significantly increased the protein content of soy-based drinks. Moreover, fermentation of soybean with 
 <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> resulted in an increase of essential amino acids such as lysine. Furthermore, co-fermentation of peanut using 
 <italic>Lactobacillus acidophilus</italic> and 
 <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> significantly increased the total protein and lysine, methionine and tryptophan contents compared to those of the corresponding mono-culture fermentations. Spontaneous co-fermentation of strains originating from cowpea and chickpea improved methionine levels. However, in other cases, mixed-culture fermentation appeared inferior to mono-culture processes [
