<p>Milk alternatives have similar sensory challenges to overcome, especially among regular cow’s milk consumers. Cow’s milk has repeatedly been preferred over soy-based alternatives in comparative sensory testing, for both adult and children studies [

 <xref rid="B38-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Participants in these studies were not regular plant milk consumers. In a study involving regular soy consumers and non-soy consumers, both groups agreed that the taste of soy was the greatest factor in consuming or not consuming soy products, including soy milk [

 <xref rid="B43-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] showed that sugar content in plant-based beverages was the most important attribute, whereas the most important attribute for cow’s milk consumers was fat content. Another study confirms that negative perceptions of cow’s milk are related to high cholesterol, fat and energy content of whole milk [
