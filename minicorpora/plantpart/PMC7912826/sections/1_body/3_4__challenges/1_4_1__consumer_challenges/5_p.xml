<p>A major challenge of plant-based meat alternatives is to recreate the appearance, texture, flavor and mouthfeel of meat products. While vegetarian and vegan consumers are more likely to accept plant-based alternatives that lack meat-like sensory properties, omnivorous and flexitarian consumers prefer alternatives that resemble meat as much as possible [

 <xref rid="B23-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], taste plays the most important role, as some consumers refuse to purchase protein alternatives because they “won’t like the taste”. Furthermore, consumers most frequently associate regular meat with taste in contrast to meat alternatives [
 <xref rid="B23-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This indicates that taste is a major driver in favor of meat, making it a challenge for the food industry to match the flavor of meat alternatives with regular meat. Interestingly, consumers find plant based alternatives more convincing when they imitate processed meat products (hamburgers, sausages, nuggets) than when they imitate unprocessed meats (e. g. steak) [
 <xref rid="B23-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This is likely because the texture of processed meats is easier to replicate than the complex matrix of unprocessed meat. Meat alternatives, therefore, have a better chance if presented in a format that resembles processed meat products such as burgers and sausages.
