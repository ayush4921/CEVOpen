<p>Lower serum vitamin D levels have been reported in vegetarians and vegans when compared to omnivores, especially when the blood was collected in late winter or beginning of spring and especially in those living at high latitudes where there is less opportunity for sun exposure [

 <xref rid="B73-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Therefore, there is a need for vegetarians to increase their vitamin D intake through sources such as milk and eggs, and fortified foods, which preferably contain the high bioavailable D
 <sub>3</sub> form. Vegans fall at a higher risk for deficiency as their only reliable source is sun exposure and some fortified plant-based foods such as breakfast cereals, plant-based drinks and mushrooms.
