<p>Bioavailability and amino acid profile of some plant-proteins such as soy are similar to the ones of eggs. However, some anti-nutrients like phytates, tannins and saponins can affect protein absorption. Lower consumption of proteins, especially lysine and methionine amino acids have been reported in vegetarians compared to omnivores [
