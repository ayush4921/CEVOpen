<p>Proteins are essential for our body to function properly and to maintain our health status, as they are the building blocks for the formation of tissues in the human body, and they are regulators (hormones, enzymes, antibodies, etc.). Proteins are formed by amino acids: essential amino acids, those that the body cannot produce by itself and thus must be obtained from food; and non-essential amino acids, that can be synthesized by the human body [

The nutritional quality of food proteins can be defined by their ability to cover the needs in essential amino acids for growth and tissue maintenance. The quality of plant proteins (vs. those from animal sources) has become a very debatable topic due to the increase in consumption of plant products.
