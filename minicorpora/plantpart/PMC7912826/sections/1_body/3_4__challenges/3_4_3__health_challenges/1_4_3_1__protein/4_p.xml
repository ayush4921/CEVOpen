<p>In addition, as it is well-known, there are mechanical and thermal pre-processing techniques (e.g., roasting, dehulling, blanching, soaking, cooking and sprouting), which can be applied to reduce anti-nutrients such as protease inhibitors, decrease off-flavor, and improve mouthfeel and color. However, some anti-nutrients are very resistant. For example, phytates cannot be destroyed entirely even by heating to 100 Â°C and a fermentation process that produces phytases that hydrolyse phytates into myo-inositol and phosphate may be more efficient [

In this regard, there is a need to develop plant-based food products that contain all essential amino acids or at least most of them and without anti-nutrients that decrease their bioavailability. Moreover, using the complementarity concept in terms of amino acid composition between plant protein sources (for example, grains and legumes eaten together or throughout the day), it will be possible to develop new food products and meat analogs of optimized nutritional and organoleptic qualities.
