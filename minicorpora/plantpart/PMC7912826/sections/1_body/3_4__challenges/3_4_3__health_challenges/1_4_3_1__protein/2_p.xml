<p>Important factors besides from the quantity, is the quality of protein intake in terms of digestibility and amino acid composition. About 30 years ago, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) proposed a reference method for evaluating the quality of dietary protein known as Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score (PDCAAS). But in 2013, FAO proposed a new index, the Digestible Essential Amino Acid Score (DIAAS), which reflects, not only the amino acid composition of proteins, but also their bioavailability (digestibility in the small intestine) [
