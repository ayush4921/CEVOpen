<p>More important than how much calcium is consumed, is how much calcium is absorbed. Calcium absorption from foods depends on physiological aspects such as age, pregnancy, lactation, and dietetic inhibitors or enhancers of absorption. Phytates and oxalates are the most prominent inhibitors of calcium in plant foods. Therefore, plant-based consumers must consider these factors in order to choose foods that are low in inhibitors and high in calcium like soy derived products fortified with calcium. Furthermore, serum vitamin D levels must be within optimum range for the body to absorb calcium. Calcium excretion may also be increased by excessive intake of sodium, animal protein, caffeine, and phosphorus (e.g., phosphoric acid in carbonated beverages), thus decreasing calcium body levels [
