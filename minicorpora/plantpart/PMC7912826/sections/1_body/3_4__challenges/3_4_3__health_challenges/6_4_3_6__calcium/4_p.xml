<p>An emerging fermentation technique that consists of mixed cultures can be of particular interest. A mixed culture of 
 <italic>Lactobacillus acidophilus</italic> and 
 <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> resulted more effective than fermentation of the individual strains in eliminating phytic acid and trypsin inhibitors in cowpea. Similarly, a mixed culture of 
 <italic>Streptococcus thermophilus</italic> and 
 <italic>Bifidobacterium infantis</italic> dramatically decreased phytic acid and saponin levels in soy. It was further found that a mixed 
 <italic>Saccharomyces boulardii</italic> and 
 <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> fermentation increased calcium bioavailability approximately six-fold compared to the mono-culture fermentation [

 <italic>Arthrospira platensis</italic>) is reported to contain calcium as high as 180% compared to milk [
 <xref rid="B57-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], which can also be potentially used to increase calcium intake (
