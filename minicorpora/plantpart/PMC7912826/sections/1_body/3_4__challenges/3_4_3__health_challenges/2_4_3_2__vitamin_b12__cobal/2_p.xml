<p>Vitamin B
 <sub>12</sub> is synthesized exclusively by microorganisms. Animals acquire this vitamin through the grass, where the bacteria responsible for synthesizing B
 <sub>12</sub> live, or by B
 <sub>12</sub> fortified feed. In contrast, only a few algae and mushrooms contain vitamin B
 <sub>12</sub>, thus, making plant-based diets inadequate. Several studies have reported lower vitamin B
 <sub>12</sub> status in vegetarians, both lacto-ovo-vegetarians and vegans, compared to omnivorous [

 <xref rid="B76-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Other studies showed a tendency to higher deficiency risk in vegans compared to lacto-ovo-vegetarians, even though the contribution of dairy and eggs to the total dietary vitamin B
 <sub>12</sub> is small in such diets [

 <sub>12</sub> supplements to prevent deficiency.
