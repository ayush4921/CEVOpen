<p>Concerning B
 <sub>12</sub> fortification, it has been suggested that lupin can serve as an alternative substrate for soybeans due to its similar protein content resulting in “lupin tempeh”. In a study performed by Wolkers-Rooijackers et al. [

 <italic>Propionibacterium freudenreichii</italic>, a vitamin B
 <sub>12</sub> producing bacterium, was used in co-culture 
 <italic>with Rhizopus oryzae</italic> to produce B

 <sub>12</sub> content (up to 0.97 μg/100 g) was achieved by fermenting lupin using these two bacteria without affecting other parameters, such as texture and volatile organic compounds. Therefore, these results are promising for vitamin B
 <sub>12</sub> fortification of legumes making products with increased nutritional value for a healthy human diet.
