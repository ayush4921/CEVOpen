<p>In addition, other factors can play significant effects. For example, food processing might contribute to deficiency as losses of cobalamin up to 50% can occur during food processing which involves cooking, pasteurization and exposure to fluorescent light. Furthermore, a decrease in the absorption capacity for this vitamin is common in ageing. Thus, factors such as food processing and ageing should be compensated with an increase in cobalamin concentration in food [

Some researchers claim that the currently recommended intake levels may not be sufficient for an adequate daily intake, with particular regard to aging and the physiological reduction in absorptive capacity. If the aged individual follows a plant-based diet the provision of adequate and bioavailable amounts of the vitamin should be guaranteed.
