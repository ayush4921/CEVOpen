<p>Another technique is hydroponic cultivation, an emerging technology that enables to grow crops directly in nutrient-rich water, which is an interesting approach to increase vitamin B
 <sub>12</sub> in foods. It has been shown that when soybean seedlings are placed in a solution containing 10 μmol/L of B
 <sub>12</sub> for 24 h, the leaves contain a significantly higher level of this vitamin (9.8 μg/g fresh weight). Japanese radish sprouts (kaiware daikon) also show significant increases in B
 <sub>12</sub> content (1.28 μg/g fresh weight) after the seeds had been soaked for 6 h in a solution containing 200 μg/mL of B
 <sub>12</sub>. A study performed by Watanabe et al. [
 <xref rid="B77-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>] produced B
 <sub>12</sub> enriched lettuce leaves cultivated using hydroponics, suggesting that B
 <sub>12</sub>-enriched lettuce leaves are an excellent source of B
 <sub>12</sub>. These results propose that B
 <sub>12</sub>-enriched vegetables may be of special benefit for vegetarians. Furthermore, data has indicated production of soy yogurt with an enhanced production of cyanocobalamin up to 18 μg/L [
