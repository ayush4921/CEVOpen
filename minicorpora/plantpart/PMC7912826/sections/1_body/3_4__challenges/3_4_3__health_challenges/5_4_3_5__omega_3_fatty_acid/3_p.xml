<p>Vegetarian and vegan diets provide high intakes of omega-6, but are low in omega-3 fatty acids, as the principal dietary source of EPA and DHA is oily fish, which is absent in vegetarian diets, and the rate of conversion of ALA to these two omega-3 FAs is very low [

The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) recommends a daily intake of EPA and DHA of between 2 g and 4 g to reach claimed effects such as the maintenance of blood pressure and triglyceride levels and intakes of 250 mg a day are sufficient for the maintenance of normal cardiac function [
