<p>Iron status may be similar in vegetarians and nonvegetarians due to several reasons. Non-heme iron can be affected by dietetic inhibitors (phytates, polyphenolics, oxalates) or enhancers (vitamin C, organic acids, citric acids) of iron absorption, thus, being a useful strategy for plant-based eaters to combine non-heme iron with enhancers while avoiding combinations with inhibitors to prevent deficiency [

In addition, several studies show that non-heme iron absorption increases when there are low iron stores as in the case of vegetarians and vegans as an adaptative response of the body to achieve adequate iron levels. Non-heme iron absorption can be as much as 10 times greater in iron deficient individuals compared to iron-replete individuals [
