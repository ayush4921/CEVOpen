<p>Several approaches are used to increase bioavailable iron in plant foods. These techniques include biofortification, ferritin content enrichment, phytic acid reduction (e-g. adding phytases during baking), microencapsulation of the iron fortificant before adding it to the food vehicle, and ascorbic acid addition [

 <xref rid="B83-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. These could be interesting approaches for food industries to fortify foods with iron even though the cost-benefit of each technique should be discussed and evaluated. Nevertheless, it should be pointed out that the main iron enhancer is ascorbic acid and the main inhibitor is phytic acid (phytates), and that these interact with iron during digestion [
