<p>Last, microalgae require less land area for protein production than animal sources. Algae requires about 2.5 m
 <sup>2</sup>/kg of protein production compared to 47–64 m
 <sup>2</sup> for pork, 42–52 m
 <sup>2</sup> for chicken, and 144–258 m
 <sup>2</sup> for beef. Furthermore, microalgae are also efficient CO₂ fixing agents. Microalgae are ecologically beneficial with a CO₂ fixation efficiency of about 90%, which is very high compared to that of the terrestrial plants. Genetically modified microalgae have received attention for their potential to enhance production of desired metabolites, but environmental risks must be adequately assessed for open cultivation [
