<p>The current Position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics [
 <xref rid="B69-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] regarding vegetarian diets includes a statement about sustainability: “… appropriately planned vegetarian, including vegan, diets are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits for the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. These diets are appropriate for all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, adolescence, older adulthood, and for athletes. Plant-based diets are more environmentally sustainable than diets rich in animal products because they use fewer natural resources and are associated with much less environmental damage”.
