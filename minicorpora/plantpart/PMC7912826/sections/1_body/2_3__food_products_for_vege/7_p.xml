<p>Plant-based milk alternatives are water-soluble extracts from legumes (chickpeas, soybeans), cereals (oats, rice), pseudo-cereals (quinoa, teff, amaranth), nuts (almonds, cashew nuts, hazelnuts, walnuts, coconut) or seeds (sesame, sunflower) that resemble cow’s milk and are consumed as a substitute.
