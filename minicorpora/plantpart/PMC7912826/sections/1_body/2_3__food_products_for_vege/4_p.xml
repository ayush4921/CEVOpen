<p>Plant-based proteins are the most common ingredients used to prepare meat alternatives. Soy, wheat gluten and mushrooms are the main ingredients used. Soy is used for its high nutritional quality to prepare protein rich products, such as tofu, obtained from coagulating and pressing soy curds into a compact block. Soy flour is the least processed soy product and is used both in the preparation of soy texturized vegetable protein and soy protein concentrate (70% protein) and isolate (90% protein). Soy meat alternatives, such as texturized vegetable protein, are usually prepared by an extrusion process, which allows for different shapes and sizes of the product [

Wheat gluten, also called seitan, is obtained during the isolation of starch from wheat flour and is used for its binding, dough-forming and leavening ability. Its cohesive and chewy quality gives the meat-like texture to the products prepared with wheat gluten. Mushrooms are also added to products for their chewiness [

Among these, pea-based protein is the most promising. Oilseed proteins from rapeseed and canola can be used as structuring agents when heated, promoting meat-like textures [
