<p>The number of consumers who are reducing their intake of food from animal origin is increasing globally due to many reasons and this involves a growing market of plant-based products. Consumers demand products that are sustainable, palatable, safe, nutritious, available, and affordable. There are many issues that should be considered when planning new sources and ingredients. In this regard, the production of alternatives to meat, such as cultured meat, has a great potential but still needs optimization. Other biotechnology processes including microalgae culture, fermentation or addition of microorganisms, such as those that are producers of vitamin B
 <sub>12</sub>, have also a great potential. It should be emphasized that these plant-based products may be applicable to subjects with special needs, e.g., due to allergy to compounds present in food from animal origin or chronic diseases that are known to revert by reducing animal food and increasing vegetables intake. Finally, being aware of protecting the planet means that plants, animals and humans are part of it and a healthy planet should be compatible with a healthier human being.
