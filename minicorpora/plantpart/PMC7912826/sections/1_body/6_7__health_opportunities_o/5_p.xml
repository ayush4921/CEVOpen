<p>On another note, food microbiome has been a topic of interest regarding diabetes and obesity as it has been shown that food microbiome interactions can improve insulin sensitivity and inflammation response [

 <xref rid="B105-foods-10-00293" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. For example, dietary fiber, which is found only in plant foods, may play a key role in this process as it modulates postprandial glucose response and is fermented by intestinal bacteria to produce short-chain fatty acids, which also improve insulin signaling and glucose response while modulating hostâ€™s inflammatory response [

A study of 144 vegetarians, 105 vegans, and an equal number of matched omnivores found that vegan and vegetarian diets produced a significant shift in the gut microbiota, with a significant reduction in the vegan subjects of 
 <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>, which is a family of bacteria implicated in triggering low-grade inflammation. Another study of six obese subjects with diabetes and/or hypertension who followed a vegan diet for one month found improved blood glucose levels and reduced body weight, a decrease in 
 <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> and 
 <italic>Firmicutes</italic> (associated with Western diets and low-grade inflammation) with a significant increase in 
 <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> (associated with low calorie and vegetarian diets). Therefore, high levels of fiber in vegan and vegetarian diets may contribute to reduce levels of inflammation and decrease risk for metabolic disease and obesity [
