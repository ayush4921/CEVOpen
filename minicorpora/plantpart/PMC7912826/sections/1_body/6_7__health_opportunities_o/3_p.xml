<p>In relation to diabetes and obesity, plant-based diets have shown beneficial effects as they include foods that contain high amounts of fiber, antioxidants, magnesium and phytochemicals, all of which have shown to increase insulin sensitivity and glycemic control [

One of the reasons plant-based diets might be effective at preventing and treating this condition is because these foods promote weight loss, reduce the energy density of foods and promote satiety, thus reducing insulin resistance [

Moreover, studies have also shown that saturated fat, which is mainly found in animal-derived foods, contributes to the increase of insulin resistance by accumulation of toxic fat metabolites in hepatic and skeletal muscle cells, impairing insulin signaling and thus decreasing glucose uptake [
