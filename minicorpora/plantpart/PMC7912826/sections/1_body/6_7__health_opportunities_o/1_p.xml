However, conflicting results have been found regarding the impact of a vegetarian diet on high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C). For example, some studies have found no difference in plasma HDL-C levels between vegetarians and omnivorous diets. Other studies of vegetarian populations found lower total cholesterol and LDL-C in a study population, which is associated to reduction of cardiovascular risk, but also lower HDL-C [
