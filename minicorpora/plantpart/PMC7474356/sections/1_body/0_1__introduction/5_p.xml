<p>In this context, numerous studies are increasingly invested in plants to isolate or identify secondary metabolites which are able to have insecticidal, repellent, or antipalatable activity against insects. Thus, some research has shown that essential oils have several properties allowing them to be considered as biopesticides in alternative strategies with the aim of limiting the use of synthetic pesticides; these biopesticides, as they are biodegradable, are considered as products with low ecological impact [
