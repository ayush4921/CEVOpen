0: The toxic effect of essential oils is based, in addition to the variability of phytochemical compounds, on other factors such as the point of entry of the toxin.
1: Indeed, the bioactivity of essential oils is directly affected by its chemical composition and its content of active compounds, which can vary considerably, even within the same species.
2: The variability factors of this composition involve the part of the plant used, the phenological state of the plant, the harvest period, the place of harvest, and the conditions of the growing environment [ 9].
3: Generally, essential oils can be inhaled, ingested, or absorbed through the skin by insects [ 9].
4: Thus, one of the properties of essential oils that deserve particular interest is their fumigant activity against insects, as it provides pest control during storage without the need for direct application of the compound to insects and without direct contact of the compound with the stored products.
