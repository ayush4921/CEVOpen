<p>We worked with infested soft wheat collected in the cereal storage warehouses of the local market, representing the largest ones in the region; we wanted our study to focus on the 
 <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> colonies infecting these premises, with a view to developing a biopesticide that could be subsequently applied there. After sieving and using entomological forceps, we separated the insects recovered on the basis of their morphological resemblance. Also, for taxonomic identification and confirmation, a binocular magnifying glass was used to visualize the main morphoanatomical features.
