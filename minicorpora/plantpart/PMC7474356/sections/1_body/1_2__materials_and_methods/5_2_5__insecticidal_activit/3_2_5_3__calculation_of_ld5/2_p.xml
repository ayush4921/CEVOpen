<p>Indeed, to estimate the LD
 <sub>50</sub> and the LT
 <sub>50</sub>, the percentages of mortality were transformed in probits and the concentrations and time in decimal logarithm. These transformations have allowed us to establish equations for regression lines “probit-logarithm” of type:
 <disp-formula id="EEq4">
  <label>(4)</label>
  <math id="M4">
   <mtable>
    <mtr>
     <mtd>
      <mi>y</mi>
      <mo>=</mo>
      <mi>a</mi>
      <mi>x</mi>
      <mo>+</mo>
      <mi>b</mi>
      <mo>,</mo>
     </mtd>
    </mtr>
   </mtable>
  </math>
 </disp-formula>where 
 <italic>y</italic> is the corrected mortality probits, 
 <italic>x</italic> is the logarithm of the dose or time, and 
 <italic>a</italic> is the slope.
