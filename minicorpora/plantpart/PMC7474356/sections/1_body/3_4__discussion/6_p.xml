<p>Inhalation tests conducted have revealed the significant insecticidal power of essential oils of 
 <italic>Ruta chalepensis</italic> on the adults of 
 <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic>; this mode of toxicity has been reported for several insect pests of stored food [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and is due to the volatile chemical compounds of the essential oils [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Thus, this insecticidal effect of the essential oils tested can be observed even at low concentrations. During the experiment, it was observed that incubation periods decrease when the doses used increase, which leads to the conclusion that the insecticidal effect of the essential oil of 
 <italic>Ruta chalepensis</italic> against adults of 
 <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> is closely dependent on the concentration used and is, therefore, dose-dependent or dose/effect.
