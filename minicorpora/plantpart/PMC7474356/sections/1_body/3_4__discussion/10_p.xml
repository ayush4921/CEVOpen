<p>Concerning the survival times of 50% of adults exposed to different concentrations of essential oil, it was found that they vary from 11.75 to 40.73 hours depending on the concentration. The TL
 <sub>50s</sub> are negatively correlated with the concentrations of the essential oil tested (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = −1). In another study, TL
 <sub>50</sub> values ranging from 32.80 to 69.37 hours were observed for the essential oil of 
 <italic>Thymus leptobotrys</italic> tested against 
 <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Such variability of the TL
 <sub>50</sub> and LD
 <sub>50</sub> can only be explained by the variation of the chemical profiles of the tested essential oils [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Taking into account the origin, it appears that after 24 hours, mortality reaches 60% for a dose of 0.2 
 <italic>μ</italic>l/ml with an LD
 <sub>50</sub> of about 0.176 
 <italic>μ</italic>l/ml for essential oil of 
 <italic>Ruta chalepensis</italic> from Mednine (Tunisia) [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]; keeping the same exposure time, almost this mortality rate is reached with a dose of 0.31 
 <italic>μ</italic>l/ml and an LD
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.257 
 <italic>μ</italic>l/ml for the essential oil of 
 <italic>Ruta chalepensis</italic> from the study region Oulmes (Morocco). Thus, the origin influences the fumigant toxicity effect of 
 <italic>Ruta chalepensis</italic> essential oil. This variation in the insecticidal effect linked to the plant's origin can be explained by the variation in the chemical composition of the plant and/or the content of active compounds. The two major compounds of 
 <italic>Ruta chalepensis</italic> essential oil from Mednine (Tunisia) are 2-undecanone (48.28%) and 2-nonanone (27.15%) [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], while for the one from Oulmes (Morocco) they are 2-undecanone (64.35%) and piperonyl piperazine (11.9%).
