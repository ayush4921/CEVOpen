<p>Biological tests carried out on the adults of 
 <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> have led to the conclusion that the essential oil of 
 <italic>Ruta chalepensis</italic> L. collected from the Oulmes region has a very high repellent power belonging to the class V; also, when the dose used increases, the repellency rate increases and the duration of exposure decreases. Therefore, the repellent effect of the essential oil of 
 <italic>Ruta chalepensis</italic> against the adults of 
 <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> is dose- and time-dependent.
