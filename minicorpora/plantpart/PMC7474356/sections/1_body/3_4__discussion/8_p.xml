<p>The tests carried out revealed that the concentrations of essential oil of 
 <italic>Ruta chalepensis</italic> which cause the mortality of 50% of the adults of 
 <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> are, respectively,0.447, 0.257, 0.20, and 0.176 
 <italic>μ</italic>l/ml for incubation periods of 12, 24, 36, and 48 hours, respectively. It is clearly observable that the longer the exposure time, the lower the dose required to kill half of the target population; therefore, the exposure time of insects to the essential oil is negatively correlated with the LD
 <sub>50</sub> (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = −1).
