<p>On the one hand, this insecticidal power is in line with the results obtained when using 
 <italic>Ruta chalepensis</italic> powder on the same insect [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]; on the other hand, negative results were obtained with the use of crude extracts of 
 <italic>Ruta chalepensis</italic> obtained by maceration, decoction, and infusion [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Thus, the observed fumigant activity demonstrates that essential oils rich in volatile compounds are a source of biologically active vapors that can potentially prove to be effective insecticides as opposed to crude extracts. The toxicity of 
 <italic>Ruta chalepensis</italic> essential oil to 
 <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> can be attributed to its high content of 2-undecanone, an aliphatic ketone with previously demonstrated insecticidal properties [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].
