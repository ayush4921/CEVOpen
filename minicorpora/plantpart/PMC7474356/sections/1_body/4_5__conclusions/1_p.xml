<p>This study was carried out in order to determine the chemical composition of 
 <italic>Ruta chalepensis</italic> essential oil from the region of Oulmes (Central plateau of Morocco) and to evaluate these effects in two bioassays: repellent and fumigant activities against a major stored grain pest 
 <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic>. Chromatographic analyses revealed the richness of this oil in volatile secondary metabolites including 2-undecanone (64.35%) which seems to be responsible for its insect repellent and insecticidal properties. Indeed, the essential oil of 
 <italic>Ruta chalepensis</italic> from the region of Oulmes has a very high repellent power which reaches 100% after only 15 min with a dose not exceeding 0.038 
 <italic>μ</italic>l/ml. Inhalation tests have also revealed the important insecticidal effect of this oil even at low doses. These tests revealed the efficiency of the essential oil of 
 <italic>Ruta chalepensis</italic> L. against the adults of 
 <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic>, which proves that this natural substance could be a healthy alternative to synthetic products to fight this pest, especially as its fumigant activity can be invested without a direct application on stored foodstuffs. Also, a thorough study of the insecticidal activity of this essential oil against 
 <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> at different stages of development would make it possible to guarantee the proper storage of cereal products.
