<p>EOs, also called volatile or ethereal oils [
 <xref rid="B29-antioxidants-10-00330" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], are aromatic lipophilic liquids obtained from plant material (flowers, buds, seeds, leaves, twigs, bark, herbs, wood, fruits, and roots). They can be obtained by expression, fermentation, enfleurage, or extraction, but steam distillation is most commonly used for commercial production of EOs [
 <xref rid="B30-antioxidants-10-00330" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The term ‘essential oil’ is thought to derive from the name coined in the 16th century by the Swiss reformer of medicine, Paracelsus von Hohenheim, who named the effective component of a drug Quinta essential [
