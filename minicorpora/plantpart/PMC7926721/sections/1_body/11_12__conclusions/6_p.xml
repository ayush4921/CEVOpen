<p>Given the plasticity of the gut and the DOHaD conceptâ€™s microbiome, the potential use of EOs in early nutrition programs (gestation and lactation) would be worthwhile. Early EO supplementation may improve the immunity responses with beneficial effects in feed efficiency and later-life performance [

 <xref rid="B258-antioxidants-10-00330" ref-type="bibr">258</xref>]. This strategy might be considerably relevant. It can reduce both the administration time (limited only to the first two months of life instead of during the lactation) and the dose needed to positively affect calves at adult age. A reduction in the total cost of the treatment might be expected. However, attention should be paid regarding the doses given to the fetus and newborn due to the unknown potential toxicity effects of EOs when given during early life.
