<p>Recent studies showed that complex coacervation could be used by mixing two oppositely charged proteins with an affinity for an encapsulated bioactive component [

Efficient encapsulation yield with a protective effect was reported for vitamin B9 encapsulated in milk-derived protein coacervates. Complex coacervation is a mix of food proteins that constitutes a new, biosourced, and economically viable method suitable for entrapment and encapsulation of hydrophobic molecules such as EOs [
