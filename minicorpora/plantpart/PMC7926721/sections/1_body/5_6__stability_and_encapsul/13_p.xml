  <italic>Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN):</italic>
 </bold> These particles are made up of lipids (triacylglycerols or waxes), solid at room temperature, biodegradable, and non-toxic, stabilized by adding suitable surfactants [
 <xref rid="B97-antioxidants-10-00330" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. Solid lipids instead of oils allow improving the control in releasing the active molecules due to its reduced mobility in a solid phase compared to the oily liquid phase [
 <xref rid="B107-antioxidants-10-00330" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. They are generally obtained by preparing an oil in water emulsion at a temperature exceeding the lipid phase melting point, and then the cooling of produced emulsion, leading to crystallization of the lipid and the trap of the target molecules either in the core or on the wall of the obtained particles [
 <xref rid="B97-antioxidants-10-00330" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. This technique is highly recommended in carrying lipophilic active components since it offers adequate protection, less leakage, and sustained release of EOs [
