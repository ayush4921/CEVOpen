<p>The encapsulation of EOs seems to be an attractive new approach to overcome all previously listed impediments [
 <xref rid="B90-antioxidants-10-00330" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Encapsulation consists of coating sensitive materials (solid, liquid, or gas) known as core material, with a protective layer called wall material [
 <xref rid="B96-antioxidants-10-00330" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. EO encapsulation is a complex process with interrelated steps [
 <xref rid="B97-antioxidants-10-00330" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. In this context, several research groups focused on EO encapsulation, and different techniques were proposed [
 <xref rid="B98-antioxidants-10-00330" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. Accordingly, choosing the encapsulation method and the encapsulating material depend on specific parameters: targeted mean particle size, the physicochemical characteristics of wall and core ingredients, the intended applications of the encapsulated material, the release system of capsule content, production capacity, and cost [
