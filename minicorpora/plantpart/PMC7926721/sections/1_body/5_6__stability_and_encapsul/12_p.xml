 </bold> In nanoemulsion, tiny EO droplets are confined to a cavity surrounded by a unique polymer membrane [
 <xref rid="B110-antioxidants-10-00330" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. The EO dispersion in water is obtained through the chemical action of surfactants. It is highly recommended to encapsulate EO into nanoemulsion-based delivery systems for different reasons: non-toxic and non-irritant, high kinetic stability, capacity to solubilize hydrophobic bioactive molecules and to enhance their bioavailability, and suitability for human and veterinary uses [
