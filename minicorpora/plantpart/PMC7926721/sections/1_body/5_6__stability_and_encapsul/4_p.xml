<p>Another valorization-limiting characteristic is EOs’ easy oxidation. Once deprived of the protective compartment in the plant matrix, EOs’ constituents are easily prone to different chemical transformations. Indeed, as EOs are both thermo-sensitive and volatile, they are easily alterable [

First, the plant’s growth stage and the vegetable material’s post-harvest storage conditions profoundly influence an EO’s alteration. Besides, other factors related to handling or storing the oil itself will also lead to the acceleration of EOs’ oxidation, such as temperature, light, and atmospheric oxygen availability. Indeed, the ultraviolet light and visible light are considered accelerators of the self-oxidation process by taking out hydrogen, leading to alkyl radicals’ formation. The oxidation of terpenoids, for example, produces the
