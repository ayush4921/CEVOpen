<p>To cover a maximum range of publications from Scopus, Web of Science (WOS), and Google scholar, we screened for the different database terms “essential oils”, “antibacterial”, “anti-inflammatory”, “immunity, “additive”, “diet”, “animal products”, “livestock”, “encapsulation”, and in some cases, combining the primary taxonomic designation and botanical synonym names of plants with the listed key terms. Then, we performed an additional literature search from WOS on EOs in livestock. The total number of articles treating the use of EOs linked with animal production and livestock and their abstract between 2010 and 2021 was 919. The distribution of the number of papers according to the year of publication (2010–2021) is represented in
