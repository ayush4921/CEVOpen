<p>Several studies tried to explain the mechanism of action of an EO towards bacteria. This mechanismâ€™s complexity is related to the chemical composition of EOs, which presents a high diversity of molecules (each molecule acts on a specific target). EOs can target the cell membrane, disrupting the cell energy status (the process of energy transduction coupled with the membrane and the solute transport) and the metabolic regulation. Sometimes, it modifies the expression of operons by inhibiting self-inducing mediators [
