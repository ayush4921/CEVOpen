Adding EOs to the meat products enhances their shelf life by inhibiting their oxidation: Adding rosemary EO on frankfurters significantly decreases the number of carbonyls originated from protein. It also reduces the color change, hardness, chewiness, and frankfurters’ adhesiveness during storage in a fridge [
