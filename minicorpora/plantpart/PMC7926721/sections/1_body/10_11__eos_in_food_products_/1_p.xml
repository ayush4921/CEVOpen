<p>To enhance the shelf life of food products and conserve their sensory characteristics, EOs could be added directly to food or in active food packaging. Researchers have been studying this phenomenon for years, and they have proven its effectiveness in vegetables, fish, dairy products, poultry, and beef packages. The EO is incorporated into a polymer matrix which is used to pack food. The migration of EO into food was studied to ensure the sensory stability of the food product.
