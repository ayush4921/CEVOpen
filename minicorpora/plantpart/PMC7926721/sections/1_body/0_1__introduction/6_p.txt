0: To our knowledge, little is known about the potential use of EOs in livestock.
1: The literatures significant findings are related to medicinal plant species effects among livestock disease without distinguishing the effects of their isolated bioactive compounds.
2: Data on EOs in ruminant and particularly the dairy sector are also limited.
3: Our review is the first to overview the current knowledge about the antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of EOs in both monogastric and ruminant husbandry, to treat mastitis, and use as feed additives, modulation of rumen metabolism, and in animal product-derived foods.
4: Its finality is to drive the nutritional and pharmaceutical industries to the potential use of EOs to improve animal health and explore encapsulated EOs as enhancers of milk and meat quality products that can facilitate their implementation as natural preservatives in foods.
