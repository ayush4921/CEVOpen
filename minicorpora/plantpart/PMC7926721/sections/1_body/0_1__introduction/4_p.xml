<p>The popularity of EOs in the animal field and health has increased rapidly during the last decade. Nevertheless, their antioxidant and beneficial immunomodulatory effects in the ruminant sector remain poorly explored [

 <xref rid="B16-antioxidants-10-00330" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Mostly in poultry and pig sectors, studies have highlighted the capacity of some EOs to increase animal performances and efficiency by enhancing digestive secretions [

However, some inconsistencies regarding the efficacy of EOs still exist, mainly linked to the nature of the compounds and some intrinsic and extrinsic factors, such as infection, nutritional status, environment, and particularly, diet composition [
