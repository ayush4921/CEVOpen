<p>The potential use of EOs as new nutraceutical additives during early growth (pregnancy and/or lactation) has not been explored yet and might be a very promising way to limit the use of antimicrobials in livestock, according to the DOHaD (Developmental Origin of Health and Diseases) concept. This concept was initially developed in humans by Barker [
