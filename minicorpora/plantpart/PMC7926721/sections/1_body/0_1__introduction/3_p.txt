0: EOs were also exploited for their flavoring properties [ 11, 12] and for their potential to be used as food preservatives as they extend the length of the shelf life of products [ 13] or reduce the concentration of  Clostridium numbers [ 14].
1: However, the main obstacle to using them as food preservatives is that they are often not potent enough and cause organoleptic alteration when added in sufficient quantities to induce the antimicrobial effect.
2: However, this approach requires more insights into the interaction between molecules to determine the most synergetic effects, which remain elusive.
