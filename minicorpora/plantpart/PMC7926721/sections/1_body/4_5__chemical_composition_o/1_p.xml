<p>The composition of EOs from a particular species of plant can differ depending on harvesting seasons, genetics, agricultural practices, and geographical sources [

For example, in Greek oregano plants, the sum of cymene, Î³-terpinene, carvacrol, and thymol is similar in EO derived from different geographic origins [
