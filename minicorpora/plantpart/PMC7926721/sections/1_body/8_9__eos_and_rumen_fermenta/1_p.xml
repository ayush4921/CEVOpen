<p>EOs have been proposed for use in ruminant feed targeting different nutritional purposes and modulating the rumenâ€™s anaerobic fermentation processes. Microbial digestion in the rumen can be improved by using feed additives. Some additives could drive the fermentation reactions towards the formation of more efficient products by acting on the balance of the microbial population. Antibiotics have been widely used in the past as microbiota regulators. However, their use as feed additives has been banned in the EU since 2006. In this context, EOs could offer some new opportunities to replace antibiotics [
