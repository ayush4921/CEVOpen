<p>Considering the multiple effects of EO on rumen microbiota, it has been proposed that EOs could improve the feed efficiency and nutrient utilization in ruminants. EO can also decrease protein degradation in the rumen, whereas controversial effects on fiber degradation have been reported. In some cases, fiber degradation seems to be enhanced [

As a result, EO effects on the extent of degradation of feed in the rumen may be highly variable, depending on the source and type of EO, dose used, and methodology used in each study. Several studies have evaluated the effects of EO on ruminal fermentation in vitro. An increase in the culture mediumâ€™s pH has been observed, although the difference observed depends on the EO added, the dose applied, and the buffer used in the medium. In general, pH is increased to a greater extent, with higher concentrations of phenols or cinnamaldehyde in the medium. This effect can be associated with the decrease in volatile fatty acid concentration in the medium, regardless of the EO tested. Although in some in vitro studies, a slight reduction in VFA production was observed when EO was added to the medium, other reports show little or no EO effect on VFA production or concentration. The VFA profile (molar proportion of each VFA) is a suitable indicator of any shift in the rumen fermentation pattern occurring in response to EO. Again, the literature results are highly diverging, although most commonly, effects showing a decrease in acetate and a trend to increase propionate and butyrate [

 <xref rid="B214-antioxidants-10-00330" ref-type="bibr">214</xref>] have been reported. As a result, it is commonly observed that EO supplementation is related to a decrease in the acetate to propionate ratio in the rumen digesta [
