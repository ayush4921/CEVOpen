<p>A recent study done by El-Essawy et al. evaluated the effect of a mixture of EOs (anise, clove, and thyme) on eight lactating shame goats. Supplementation of these EOs improved digestibility with no effect on intake and milk yield. They found that EOs’ supplementation improved the fermentation (digestibility of organic matter, ether extract, and acid detergent fiber was higher). Adding the EO increased milk fat yield, fat content, and the concentrations of unsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids (FA) compared with the control diet [

Soltan et al. studied the effect of a microencapsulated mixture of EOs containing cinnamaldehyde, eugenol, carvacrol, and capsicum oleoresin on Santa Inês sheep. They found that the feed implementation of this mixture decreases methane production [
