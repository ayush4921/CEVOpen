<p>However, greater doses could have a pro-oxidant effect on the animal, with detrimental consequences on health status and product quality. This is because high doses of EO can permeabilize the mitochondria, thus changing electrons’ flow and producing more free radicals, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) that oxidize lipids and proteins. Some metabolites might be accumulated at the meat level, since supplementing lambs with rosemary EOs improved the sensory properties of lamb’s meat (e.g., flavor and overall acceptability were increased) [
 <xref rid="B221-antioxidants-10-00330" ref-type="bibr">221</xref>]. However, it is interesting to note that most of the studies published describing the effects of EOs on meat quality when being fed to animals do not evaluate the transmission of metabolites/compounds to the product, which can be different according to the absorption distribution metabolism and excretion (ADME) of the various components included in the composition of the EO administered. Therefore, many of these studies cannot attribute the effects observed in meat quality to direct or indirect effects caused by the different compounds of EOs at the meat level. This approach should be addressed in the future for a better comprehension of the mechanisms of action unchained by EOs at the meat level.
