<p>Similar doses of EOs have been suggested when feeding dairy ruminants to improve feed efficiency and milk quality. For example, Al-Suwaiegh et al. have recently described improvements in milk yield, milk total bacterial count, milk somatic cell count, and feed efficiency when feeding the lowest dose (2.5 g/head/day vs 5 g/head/day) of an EOs blend of clove, oregano, and juniper in equal proportions to early lactating Holstein dairy cows. They attributed these effects, at least partially, to lack of inhibition of the rumen microbial populations by the lowest EO dose [
