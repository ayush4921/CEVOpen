<p>In vitro studies have demonstrated the antibacterial activity of EOs against several pathogens that can cause mastitis, such as, among the others,

 <italic>Salmonella typhimurium, E.coli,</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B147-antioxidants-10-00330" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>]. The EOsâ€™ chemical constituents promote bacterial cell wall and membrane damages, such as cell wall degradation, protein denaturation, and destabilization of proton motive force. Given their lipophilic nature, EOs can penetrate the lipid bi-layer of the bacterial cell membrane, causing loss of integrity and structural organization [
