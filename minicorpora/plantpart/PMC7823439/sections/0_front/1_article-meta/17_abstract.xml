 <p>The essential oil (EO) and hydrosol (HL) isolated from 
  <italic>Cuminum cyminum</italic> (cumin) seeds were evaluated against the root-knot nematodes 
  <italic>Meloidogyne incognita</italic> and 
  <italic>M. javanica</italic>. The efficacy of extracts on the motility, hatching, and survival in soil of second-stage juveniles (J2s), and the activity on egg differentiation were tested. All J2s were paralyzed after immersion in the EO at 62.5 μL/L concentration for 96 h. Encouraging results were recorded using HL equal to or higher than 10% concentration for both 
  <italic>Meloidogyne</italic> species tested. More than 70% paralyzed J2s were recorded after immersion for 48 h, while the percentage was increased to higher than 90% after 96 h of immersion. A clear effect on egg differentiation was observed after immersion in EO or HL. A significant decrease in egg differentiation was revealed at even low concentrations of EO while an evident decrease in egg differentiation was recorded after immersion of eggs in 50% HL dilution. Decreased hatching of 
  <italic>M. incognita</italic> and 
  <italic>M. javanica</italic> J2s was observed with the increase in concentration. The lowest numbers of hatched J2s were recorded when EO was used at 1000 and 2000 μL/L concentrations. A constant reduction in root-knot nematode J2 hatching was observed upon increasing the concentration of HL from 5% to 50%. The EO of 
  <italic>C. cyminum</italic> is characterized by the presence of γ-terpinene-7-al (34.95%), cumin aldehydes (26.48), and α-terpinene-7-al (12.77%). The above constituents were observed in HL following the same order as that observed in EO. The components γ-terpinene (11.09%) and 
  <italic>ο</italic>-cymene (6.56%) were also recorded in EO while they were absent in HL.
