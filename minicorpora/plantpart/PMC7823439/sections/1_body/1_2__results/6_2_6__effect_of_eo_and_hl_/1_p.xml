<p>A gradual decrease in the number of nematodes per root system was recorded as the concentration of EO was increased from 7.8 to 500 μL/L for both 
 <italic>Meloidogyne</italic> species (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00046-f007">Figure 7</xref>). The lowest numbers of nematode females were observed at the concentration of 500 μL/L for 
 <italic>M. incognita</italic> and 250 and 500 μL/L for 
 <italic>M. javanica.</italic> No significant differences to the untreated control were recorded for the number of females per root system, whether for 
 <italic>M. incognita</italic> or 
 <italic>M. javanica</italic> at the lowest EO concentration of 7.8 μL/L. Hydrosol dilutions at concentrations up to 0.1 
 <italic>v/v</italic> showed no significant differences compared to the untreated control for either 
 <italic>M. javanica</italic> or 
 <italic>M. incognita</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00046-f008">Figure 8</xref>). A significant decrease was observed after increasing the concentration to 0.2 
 <italic>v/v</italic> for both 
 <italic>Meloidogyne</italic> species tested, and a further decrease in female numbers per root system was observed after increasing the dilution to 0.5
