<p>The paralysis caused to 
 <italic>M. incognita</italic> and 
 <italic>M. javanica</italic> J2s by the different dilutions of the HL is presented in 
 <xref rid="plants-10-00046-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="plants-10-00046-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>, respectively. For both nematode species, an increase in the paralyzed J2s was observed with the increase in concentration or exposure time. However, there was variability in paralysis levels between the two experiments, mainly in the lower dilutions for both nematode species.
