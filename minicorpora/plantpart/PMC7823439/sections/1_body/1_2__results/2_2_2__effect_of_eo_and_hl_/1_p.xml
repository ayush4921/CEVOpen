The same level of J2 paralysis remained as the concentration was increased to 500 μL/L. It is noticeable that low J2 paralysis was observed up to the concentration of 31.2 for both species after immersion times of 24 and 48 h, while the recorded paralysis was drastically increased as the concentration was increased to 62.5 μL/L (
