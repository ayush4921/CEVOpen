<p>The results of the effect of the EO on hatching inhibition, as means of the two experiments, are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00046-f005">Figure 5</xref>. The effect of the EO on hatching of J2s was related to different concentrations after 35 days of exposure for both species. A clear reduction in 
 <italic>M. javanica</italic> juvenile hatching was observed as the concentration was increased to 1000 μL/L and 2000 μL/L. No significant differences were recorded among the concentrations in the range from 62.5 to 500 μL/L. Hatching of 
 <italic>M. incognita</italic> J2s decreased with the increase in concentration. The highest number of unhatched eggs was recorded at the dose of 2000 μL/L. For both 
 <italic>Meloidogyne</italic> species, a significant reduction in J2 hatching was observed when the concentration of HL was increased to 0.05 
 <italic>v/v</italic>. No significant difference was observed for the two lowest HL concentrations (0.01 and 0.02 
 <italic>v/v</italic>) in comparison with the untreated control (
