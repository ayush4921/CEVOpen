<p>Seeds were purchased from a commercial supplier in Athens, Greece. The essential oil was isolated from seeds of 
 <italic>C. cyminum</italic> via hydrodistillation (HD) for 3 h in a 5 L Clevenger-type apparatus. The essential oil was dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO
 <sub>4</sub>). The hydrosol was collected in a separate glass bottle. A part of it was extracted using diethyl ether in order to isolate the volatile compounds. The organic phase was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and reduced to a final volume. Both the essential oil and the organic phase were stored at 18 °C until their analysis. The determination of the chemical composition of the plant isolates was achieved using the gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) technique with a Trace Ultra Gas Chromatographer coupled to a DSQ II Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Scientific), fitted with a TR-5MS (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) capillary column (Thermo Scientific). The injector and MS transfer line temperatures were set at 220 and 250 °C, respectively. Experimental conditions included an oven GC temperature programmed from 60 to 250 °C at a rate of 3 °C/min. Helium was used as the carrier gas at 1 mL/min flow rate. A quantity of 1.0 μL of the diluted samples in the case of EO (1/1000 in acetone,

 <italic>v</italic>) or of the organic phase were injected manually in splitless mode. The MS was operated in electrospray ionization (EI) mode at 70 eV, with an ion source temperature of 240 °C, whereas mass spectra were acquired in scan mode for a mass range of 35–400. Tentative identification of the compounds was achieved on the basis of a comparison of their relative retention indices and mass spectra with corresponding data reported in the literature and the instrument’s databases [Adams Book 07, Nist 98, Xcalibur]. The relative retention indices (RRIs) of compounds were determined with reference to the retention times of C

 <italic>n</italic>-alkanes. Relative percentages of the compounds were obtained electronically from area percentage data.
