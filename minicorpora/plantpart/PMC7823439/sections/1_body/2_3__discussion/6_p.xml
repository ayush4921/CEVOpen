<p>Our results show that significantly low numbers of J2s survived in the soil after the application of 
 <italic>C. cyminum</italic> EO at 250 and 500 μL/L concentrations. The lowest level of nematode infection on tomato roots was observed in the soil treated with EO at 500 μL/L. The use of HL at the concentration of 0.2 
 <italic>v/v</italic> was effective in reducing the numbers of J2s in soil, and a further significant J2 reduction was observed upon increasing the concentration to 0.5 
 <italic>v/v</italic>.
