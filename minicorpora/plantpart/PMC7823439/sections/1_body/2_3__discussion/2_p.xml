<p>Different amounts of terpenes were present in the EO and HL. Monoterpenes occupied almost the whole composition of the essential oil of 
 <italic>C. cyminum.</italic> Hydrocarbon and oxygenated monoterpenes (HMs, OMs) constituted 23.6% and 75.6% of the oil, respectively. The components detected as principles were 
 <italic>γ</italic>-terpinen-7-al, cumin aldehyde, 
 <italic>α</italic>-terpinen-7-al, and 
 <italic>γ</italic>-terpinene, followed by 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene and 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene. The above compounds also prevailed (almost 93%) in the essential oil composition of 
 <italic>C. cyminum</italic> from Iran [
 <xref rid="B26-plants-10-00046" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Quite different was the GC–MS profile obtained from the oil distillated from the dry seeds of 
 <italic>C. cyminum</italic> growing wild in Iran, which exhibited α-pinene, limonene, 1,8-cineole, and linalool (sum 79.5%) as its main compounds [
 <xref rid="B27-plants-10-00046" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Thymol (40.1%) was abundant in the oil from 
 <italic>C. cyminum</italic> plants. However, it is well known that there are differences in the chemical compositions of the EO obtained from plants grown in different locations [
 <xref rid="B28-plants-10-00046" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The compounds determined to the composition of 
 <italic>C. cyminum</italic> hydrosol belonged to the group of oxygenated monoterpenes (OMs), and they constituted 99.3% of the oil remaining in water phase. HMs are characterized as nonpolar compounds; thus, their solubility in water is limited, and this can explain why they were not detected in the hydrosol. Terpinen-7-al, cumin aldehyde, and 
 <italic>α</italic>-terpinen-7-al were the dominant compounds of the hydrosol. These compounds were higher than those detected in the EO composition.
