<p>The egg stage is the most resistant stage in the nematode’s life cycle, due to its three-layer shell consisting of an outer vitelline, a middle chitinous, and an inner lipid layer, providing a remarkable shield of protection. This layer shell is the most important barrier when it comes to breaching and enabling nematicidal activity. Preliminary trials showed that low concentrations (7.8, 15.6, and 31.2 μL/L) did not reveal any effect on hatching and they were not used for this reason, while two higher concentrations (1000 and 2000 μL/L) were included in the trials (

 <italic>M. javanica</italic> from hatching at concentrations of 62.5 to 500 μL/L, while a further hatching decrease was observed upon increasing the EO concentration to 1000 and 2000 μL/L. Immersion of 
 <italic>M. incognita</italic> eggs in 
 <italic>C. cyminum</italic> EO resulted in a decrease in hatching as the concentration was increased. The lowest concentration tested (62.5 μL/L) did not show any statistical difference compared to the control, while any further increase resulted in a substantial decrease in egg hatching. When HL was used, there were two levels of hatching decrease for both 
 <italic>Meloidogyne</italic> species tested. There was a clear effect on hatching as the concentration was increased to 0.02 
 <italic>v/v</italic> and a further significant decrease in egg hatching was observed upon increasing the concentration to 0.5 
 <italic>v/v</italic>. The egg hatching inhibition activity tested on egg masses is an indication of either the EO’s or HL’s ability to penetrate the gelatinous matrix and act on nematode eggs [
