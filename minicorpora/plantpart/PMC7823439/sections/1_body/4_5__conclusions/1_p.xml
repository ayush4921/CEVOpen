<p>In conclusion, our work showed that EO and HL extracted from 
 <italic>C. cyminum</italic> seeds can control 
 <italic>M. incognita</italic> and 
 <italic>M. javanica</italic>. Our results underlined the permanent paralysis activity against J2s along with the inhibition of egg differentiation and hatching. On the basis of these results, EO and HL extracted from 
 <italic>C. cyminum</italic> seeds could be favorably considered in the use of root-knot nematode control strategies, although further studies are necessary to determine the most efficient application rate in field conditions with different soils, crops, and application times.
