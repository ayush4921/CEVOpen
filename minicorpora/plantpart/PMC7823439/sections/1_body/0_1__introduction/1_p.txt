0: Plant parasitic nematodes belonging to the genus  Meloidogyne are one of the most widespread and destructive groups of plant parasites, and their control is extremely challenging [ 1].
1: A large variety of crops worldwide can be infested, and the impact on yield losses has been estimated as a billion euros annually [ 2].
2: In recent years, the management of root-knot nematode (RKN) populations in vegetable production was mainly based on the use of chemical nematicides.
3: However, many of the most effective and well-known nematicides, such as methyl bromide and 1,3 dichloropropene, have been phased out due to their adverse effects on the environment.
4: Farmers are obliged or enforced to use other means of management such as cultural practices, crop rotation, resistant cultivars, or rootstocks, while the use of synthetic chemical nematicides is declining.
5: However, the persistence and efficacy of the nematicides still in use are reduced due to enhanced degradation [ 3, 4].
6: Researchers keep trying to find new molecules effective against plant parasitic nematodes [ 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].
7: Isolated phytochemicals from different plant species have been used as pesticides themselves or have served as model compounds for synthetic agrochemicals by the industry [ 10].
8: Plant-origin essential oils (EOs) and their components have been tested against plant parasitic nematodes [ 10, 11, 12].
9: Volatile organic compounds produced by plants belonging to different botanical families are useful as defense substances against pests and pathogens.
10: They are a complex mixture of mainly terpenoids and a variety of aromatic phenols, oxides, ethers, alcohols, esters, aldehydes, and ketones [ 13].
11: Their chemical composition is not consistent among plant species and varieties, or different ratios of substances can be found due to the phenological stages of the plant.
12: There are reports of EOs showing antimicrobial, antifungal [ 14], antioxidant [ 15], and insecticidal activities [ 16, 17], antigermination activity in weed species [ 18], and nematicidal properties [ 19, 20].
13: Specifically, many EOs and their components have been reported to have efficacy against pinewood ( Bursaphelenchus xylophilus) and root-knot nematodes ( Meloidogyne spp.)
14: [ 10, 21, 22].
15: Iacobellis et al.
16: [ 23] demonstrated the antibacterial activity of  Cuminum cyminum L. oil against genera responsible for plant or cultivated mushroom diseases.
17: Although there are many studies using EOs, less attention has been paid to the use of hydrosols.
18: Petrakis et al.
19: [ 24], working with hydrosols (HLs) isolated from three Lamiaceae plants, showed a significant change in  Myzus persicae behavior.
20: Traka et al.
21: [ 25] reported that hydrosols derived from  Ocinum basilicum and  Ruta chalepensis were effective against  Aphis gossypii and  Tetranychus urticae.
