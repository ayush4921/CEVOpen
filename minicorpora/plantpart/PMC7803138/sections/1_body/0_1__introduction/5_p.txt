0: Steam distillation method has been used widely for commercial extraction of essential oils [ 19].
1: However, it is difficult to control the heat transfer throughout the extraction process and the extraction time using steam distillation [ 4].
2: In addition, steam distillation extracts up to 93% of the essential oil [ 20].
3: In order to increase the content of essential oils extracted, this study utilized a new design of steam distillation developed by Masango [ 20] that reduces the loss of polar compounds in waste water.
4: The plant material is placed above the water such that it is not in contact with the water, but the steam from heated water passes through it and extracts water-soluble compounds, which are then dissolved in the aqueous fraction at a lower extent [ 20].
5: Alternatively, Gas Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) is one of the best tools to identify and quantify the constituents of essential oils because of its simplicity, rapidity, accuracy, and efficiency [ 21].
6: Consequently, GC-MS has of late been widely used in chromatographic fingerprinting of medicinal plants [ 22 24].
