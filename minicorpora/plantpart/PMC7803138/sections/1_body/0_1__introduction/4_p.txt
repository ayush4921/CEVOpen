0: There are different methods of essential oil extraction such as steam distillation and low temperature distillation for those compounds that require low temperatures [ 2] and hydrodistillation and extraction with solvents [ 17].
1: The method of extraction determines the quality of essential oil.
2: Inappropriate extraction procedures can lead to damage or change of the chemical nature of the essential oil [ 4].
3: Many natural products are thermally unstable and can easily be damaged during thermal extraction [ 18].
4: The method of extraction used depends on the kind of compounds present in the oil and the location of the oils within the vegetative structure of the plant species [ 17].
