<p>Concerning growth conditions and rough filtrate production of the Tve cultures filtrate, the basidiomycete was grown in Petri dishes (9 cm diameter) for 7 days on PDA (potato dextrose agar) and incubated at 25 °C as described in Parroni et al. [
 <xref rid="B62-antibiotics-09-00628" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Briefly, three plugs of agarized mycelial mass, grown for 7 days at 25 °C on PDA plates, were added to 100 mL potato dextrose broth (PDB; Difco, BD, Milan, Italy) and grown at 25 °C for 14 days on a rotary shaker at 150 rpm. The total mycelia mass was homogenized, and 5% 
 <italic>v/v</italic> of the suspension was inoculated in 500 mL PDB and incubated (25 °C for 14 days at 150 rpm). After 14 days, the cultures were filtrated by sequential filtration with 25 µm, 0.45 µm and 0.2 µm Whatman filters to separate the mycelium from filtrates. The filtrates were then concentrated 20 times with Rotavapor (Rotavapor
 <sup>®</sup> R-300, Buchi, Essen, Germany) and used for the experiments with Cmm and Rs.
