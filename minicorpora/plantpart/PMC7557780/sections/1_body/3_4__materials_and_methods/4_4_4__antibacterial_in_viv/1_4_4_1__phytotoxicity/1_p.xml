<p>The phytotoxicity of the oils tested on tomato seeds was evaluated with a germination test using the standard “top of paper method” described in the International Rules for Seed Testing [
 <xref rid="B64-antibiotics-09-00628" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Stocks of 100 tomato seeds (cultivar Roma) were treated by immersion in aqueous solution of EOs or Tve at different concentrations for 10 min and then completely dried on sterile blotting paper at room temperature, in sterile conditions. The oils were diluted using DMSO (final concentration 1%) to obtain the following concentrations: 0%, 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.3%, and 0.4%. Tve was dissolved in water and the following concentrations were tested: 0×, 0.5×, 1×. Not treated seeds were used as further control. Seeds were then kept under constant humid conditions and incubated at 25 ± 1 °C. Germination was evaluated after 5 and 14 days; a seed was considered germinated if it produced a well-developed seedling with root and shoot. The experiment involved two stocks of 100 seeds for each treatment and was repeated twice. Data collected comprised the number of germinated seeds.
