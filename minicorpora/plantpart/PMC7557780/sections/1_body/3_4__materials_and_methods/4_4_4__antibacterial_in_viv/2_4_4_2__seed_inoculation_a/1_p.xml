<p>The EOs of cinnamon and oregano, selected from the ones tested in vitro, were used for testing the effectiveness of EOs in reducing Cmm infection in tomato seedlings after seed treatment. Tomato seeds’ (cultivar Roma) surface was washed under tap water, soaked first in denaturized alcohol, and then in 3.5% sodium hypochlorite for 10 min and subsequently rinsed three times in sterile distilled water. The seeds were completely dried under a chamber laminar flow. The sterilized seeds were inoculated by soaking in bacterial suspension (10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/mL) in a sterilized flask, and vacuum was applied for 30 min to facilitate cell adhesion to the seed surface. After inoculation, the seeds were dried on sterile blotting paper at room temperature under a cabinet laminar flow and kept at 4 °C in the dark until use. The concentrations of cinnamon and oregano oils were selected according to Marinelli et al. [
 <xref rid="B28-antibiotics-09-00628" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] for treatment of sterilized and Cmm-inoculated tomato seeds. The following thesis were evaluated: not treated tomato seeds inoculated (positive control) and not (negative control); seeds inoculated and treated with (i) sterilized distilled water and DMSO 1%, (ii) cinnamon oil 0.4%, (iii) oregano oil 0.4%. Seeds were then sown in a germination chamber with three wet paper layers and kept under constant humid conditions with alternation of 12 h light and 12 h darkness. After 5 days (cotyledon stage), the seedling epigeal parts were collected, and six bulks per treatment of eight seedlings each were sampled, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until DNA extraction.
