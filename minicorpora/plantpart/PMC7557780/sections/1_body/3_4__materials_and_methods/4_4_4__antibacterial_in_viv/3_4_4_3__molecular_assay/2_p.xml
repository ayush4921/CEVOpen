<p>The quantification of Cmm and Rs biomass in the plant samples was performed following Chen et al. [
 <xref rid="B67-antibiotics-09-00628" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]; standard curves relating Ct (cycle threshold) values to bacterial density (CFU/mL) in host tissue were obtained for each pest as follows: a 24 h culture broth of each pathogen was adjusted to 1 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/mL with sterile water, and a 10-fold dilution series was prepared (10
 <sup>8</sup> to 10
 <sup>2</sup>). Two dilutions, 10
 <sup>4</sup> and 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU/mL, were plated in triplicates in NAG medium to verify their correct quantification by colony counting. Each sample, consisting in the biomass of eight healthy tomato shoots 5 days after sowing, was added to 100 μL of the serial bacterial dilutions and to 100 μL water as negative control; the DNA was extracted as previously described. Cmm-infected tomato seeds treated with oregano and cinnamon EOs were tested by real-time PCR for the quantification of the bacterial DNA to assess their antibacterial efficacy in vivo in the very early stages of seedling development. Results are expressed as mean CFU ± standard deviation. In order to avoid false negative results, the plant tissue macerate of two additional samples (500 µL) for each treatment was added in yeast dextrose carbonate (YDC) (5 mL) liquid medium as an enrichment step for 3 days at 25 °C on a rotary shaker and then checked by real-time PCR on genomic DNA extracted as described above. The enrichment step was repeated twice.
