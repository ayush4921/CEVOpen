<p>A real time PCR molecular assay was performed to quantify the DNA of the pathogens on young seedlings developed from artificially infected seeds and treated with oil, as described below. The plant tissues were homogenized with pestle and liquid nitrogen in a pre-chilled mortar. All genomic DNA extractions were performed using the commercial kit DNeasy blood and tissue (Qiagen), following the manufacturer’s instructions for Gram-positive (Cmm cultures and infected plants) and Gram-negative bacteria (Rs cultures and infected plants). The concentration and quality (λ260/230 and λ260/280 absorbance ratios) of the DNA was assessed using the NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the Qubit 1.0 fluorometer (Invitrogen), and each DNA sample was diluted to a final concentration of 20 ng/µL. All the reactions were performed in triplicate in a CFX96 Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-rad); the amplification analyses were carried out using the CFX Manager Software, version 3.1 (Bio-Rad). For each bacterium, the efficiency and sensitivity of the real-time PCR assays [
