<p>Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed using CoStat-Statistics Software version 6.4. The significance of the differences between treated and compound-free control samples of the in vitro assay was evaluated using the Tukey-Kramer test for multiple comparisons (significance level 0.01). Regarding the phytotoxicity test, ANOVA was performed on the arcsin-transformed data. The significance of the differences between treated and control samples was evaluated using the Duncan test for multiple comparisons (significance level 0.05). Molecular data, transformed into CFU in each treatment, were statistically evaluated using ANOVA and the Student–Newman–Keuls test for multiple comparisons (significance level 0.01).</p>
