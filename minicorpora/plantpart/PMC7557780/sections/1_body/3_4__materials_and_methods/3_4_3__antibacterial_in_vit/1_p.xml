<p>The activity of six EOs and Tve was evaluated against Cmm and Rs following the CLSI 2015 microdilution method [
 <xref rid="B63-antibiotics-09-00628" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. A starter culture was prepared by suspending the bacterial cells in 5 mL of nutrient broth supplemented with 5% saccharose (NSB) and incubated at 25 ± 2 °C (for Cmm) and 28 ± 2 °C (for Rs) for 24 h at 150 rpm. The bacterial suspensions were diluted to obtain an absorbance value at the spectrophotometer corresponding to a concentration of 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/mL: the optical density was 0.5 OD (λ = 600 nm) for Cmm and between 0.08 and 0.1 OD (λ = 660 nm) for Rs. Series of oil dilutions were prepared in a DMSO solution (final concentration 1%) in a 96-well microdilution tray and inoculated with the bacterial suspension at a final concentration of 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU/mL in NSB (total volume 200 μL). Tve was diluted at the desired concentration in water. Wells containing sterile NSB alone and supplemented with the oils or Tve were used as negative controls. Wells containing bacterial-inoculated NSB with and without DMSO were the positive oil-free controls. Tetracycline (8 mg/mL) was used as a further control. The concentration series for EOs were as follows: 50 ppm, 100 ppm, 200 ppm, 400 ppm, 800 ppm, 1200 ppm, and 1600 ppm (except for thyme: 75 ppm, 150 ppm, 300 ppm, 450 ppm, 600 ppm, 900 ppm, 1200 ppm). For Tve, the following concentrations were used: 2×, 1.5×, 1×, 0.75×, 0.5×, and 0.25×. The plates were incubated at 25 °C for Cmm and at 28 °C for Rs, and the bacterial growth was observed after 48 h measuring the optical density with a microplate photometer (Thermo Scientific™ Multiskan™ FC Waltham, MA, USA; λ = 620 nm). Three replications for each plate were performed with two plates running in parallel, and the experiment was repeated twice; thus, each treatment relied on a total of 12 replications. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC90) was determined as the lowest concentration of assayed compounds that caused a 90% growth inhibition compared with the control. It was determined by calculating the percentage inhibition of bacterial growth and using regression equation for R &gt; 0.85. To determine the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), aliquots of bacterial suspension (100 μL) that did not show visible turbidity were aseptically plated on NAG. The MBC was considered as the lowest concentration of EOs or Tve that inhibits growth of visible colonies on NAG.
