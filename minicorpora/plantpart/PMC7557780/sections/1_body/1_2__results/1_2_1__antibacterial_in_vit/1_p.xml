<p>The bacterial growth of Rs and Cmm, containing different oil/compound concentrations, was measured as optical density (λ = 620 nm) after incubation in broth medium and is reported respectively in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-09-00628-f002">Figure 2</xref>. The presence of DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) in the medium broth did not influence the Cmm growth, while the Rs growth was slightly negatively affected (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-09-00628-f002">Figure 2</xref>, the concentration 0 indicates the growth of bacteria in NSB (nutrient sucrose broth) in the presence of DMSO. A different antibacterial property of the analysed compounds was observed in this study. Most oils tested caused a significant inhibition of bacterial growth starting from the lowest concentration studied: garlic oil at 50 ppm for Rs and 100 ppm for Cmm; clove oil at 150 ppm for Rs and 100 ppm for Cmm; oregano and cinnamon oil at 100 ppm and thyme oil at 150 ppm for both bacteria. An exception was basil, which showed a significant bacterial inhibition starting only from 800 ppm against both bacteria. Tve showed a significant bacteriostatic activity since 0.25× and 0.5× dilution respectively for Cmm and Rs. The antibacterial activity of the compounds is summarized in 
 <xref rid="antibiotics-09-00628-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, where the minimum inhibitory concentration causing a 90% growth inhibition (MIC90) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) are reported. To acquire more accurate data on the antibacterial effects of the selected oils, MIC90 was calculated using a regression equation (
 <xref rid="antibiotics-09-00628-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). A good correlation between the growth inhibition and the oil concentrations with a regression coefficient R &gt; 0.85 was found for the EOs cinnamon (MIC90: 320 ppm for Cmm and 290 ppm for Rs), basil (MIC90: 1265 ppm for Cmm and 1270 ppm for Rs), oregano (MIC90: 155 ppm for Cmm and 290 ppm for Rs), thyme (MIC90: 225 ppm for Cmm and 360 ppm for Rs), garlic (MIC90: 130 ppm for Cmm), and clove for Rs (MIC90: 290 ppm for Rs). Garlic oil did not show a good correlation for Rs, and value ranges between 200 and 400 ppm were reported for MIC90, and the same was for clove against Cmm (MIC90: 400 ppm). Tve showed a similar bacteriostatic effect against both bacteria, while the bactericidal activity was more evident on Rs (MBC = 0.5×) compared to Cmm (MBC = 1.5×). The regression equation did not show a good correlation (
 <xref rid="antibiotics-09-00628-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), and a value range of 0.25×–0.5× was reported at MIC 90 for Cmm and Rs.
