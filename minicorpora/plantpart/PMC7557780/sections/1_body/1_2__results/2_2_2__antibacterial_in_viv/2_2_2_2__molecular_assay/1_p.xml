<p>The DNA purification produced good quality DNA, suitable as a template in quantitative real-time PCR. The amplification efficiency of real-time PCR and the correlation index of standard curves obtained by 10-fold serial dilutions (from 0.1 ng to 1 fg) of the target DNA were verified, in conditions of absence and presence of host DNA. The results (
 <xref rid="antibiotics-09-00628-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) showed good amplification efficiency, an excellent correlation index, and a discrete sensitivity for both pathogens. The standard curves on gDNA extracted from bacterial suspension of known concentration (

 <sup>3</sup> CFU/mL: below this threshold bacteria are still detectable, but such detection less reliable. The results of the Cmm biomass quantification in seedlings of seeds inoculated with Cmm and treated or not with cinammon and oregano EOs are reported in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-09-00628-f004">Figure 4</xref>. The amplification signals of the artificially infected and untreated samples showed that the infection had occurred successfully (with 8.6 Ã— 10
 <sup>5</sup> CFU/mL detected), probably by contact of the tissues during the germination phase. The treatment with H
 <sub>2</sub>O partially reduced the quantity of inoculum, but this reduction of the inoculum was not significant compared to the positive control. Otherwise, both EOs at the tested concentration demonstrate significantly antibacterial activity with low levels of CFU equivalents (

 <sup>3</sup> CFU/mL), each sample was also subjected to an enrichment step, and the amplification of DNA occurred only in 25% of examined samples. The not treated samples showed DNA amplification in 100% of the trials.
