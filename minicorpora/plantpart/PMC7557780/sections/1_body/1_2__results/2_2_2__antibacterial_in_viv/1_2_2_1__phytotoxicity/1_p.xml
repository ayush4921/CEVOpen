<p>The influence of EOs and Tve on tomato seed germination percentages is reported in 
 <xref rid="antibiotics-09-00628-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. By comparing the treatment averages at different concentrations versus the control, we assessed phytotoxicity. The only case of highly significant phytotoxicity was for 0.4% clove bud oil, which caused a decrease in germinability from 96.3% (control) to 86%. Cinnamon oil also showed significant differences as compared to the control, starting from 0.2%, but the reduction in germination percentage was about 1â€“2 percentage points; from a practical point of view, this percentage is only slightly influential and avoidable by using a larger quantity of seeds. Garlic oil, basil oil, oregano oil, and thyme oil did not affect the germination percentage as well as Tve at none of the concentrations tested, which can be considered as not phytotoxic to tomato seeds germination.
