0: Clavibacter michiganensis subsp.
1: michiganensis (Smith) Davis, Gillaspies, Vidaver & Harris (Cmm) and  Ralstonia solanacearum (Smith) Yabuuchi et al.
2: (Rs) are important bacterial pathogens of tomato ( Solanum lycopersicum L.), able to cause economic losses worldwide.
3: Cmm, the seed-borne Gram-positive bacterium that is the causal agent of bacterial canker, is considered to be one of the most destructive and economically significant diseases of tomato [ 1] in temperate climates and greenhouses worldwide.
4: The disease symptoms observed in plants infected by Cmm are wilt, yellow-brown vascular discoloration, cankers on stems, and petioles and lesions on fruit [ 2].
5: Cmm is transmitted to flowers and settles internally in developing seeds through vascular tissues [ 2], but also externally through tomato fruit lesions [ 3]; moreover, it may contaminate the outside of the seed coat [ 4].
6: It is reported that one infected seed in 10,000 is able to establish an epidemic [ 2, 5], and a population of 10 2 CFU (colony forming units)/seed has been suggested as the probable threshold level for pathogen transmission from naturally infected seeds [ 6].
7: Latently infected young plants or asymptomatic infections during late stages of plant development, resulting in the production of contaminated seeds, are also considered important for disease spread [ 7, 8, 9].
8: Prevention, based on seed testing and maintaining pathogen-free seeds and transplants, is currently the most appropriate approach for disease control, and cultural practices such as eradication of infected plants and disinfestation of materials are recommended [ 2, 7, 10].
9: Zero tolerance import and export restrictions have been implemented for Cmm in the European Union with the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072 of 28 November 2019.
