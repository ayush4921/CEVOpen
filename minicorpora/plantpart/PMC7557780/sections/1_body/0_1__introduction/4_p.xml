<p>Seed-borne bacterial diseases are a serious concern in conventional as well as organic/low input crop systems and represent a very critical issue for a successful production. The use of untreated seed infected with seed-borne pathogens can have a direct effect on yield and on the spread of pathogen inoculum in the soil, leading to the introduction of diseases into previously unaffected areas or their re-emergence [
 <xref rid="B18-antibiotics-09-00628" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Seed treatment with plant protection products represents one of the first options useful to reduce seed infection or contamination and prevent pathogen dissemination. Recently, the European Union has been supporting several initiatives in favor of sustainable agriculture enclosed in the New Common European Agricultural Policy 2014â€“2020 (CAP). According to these community initiatives, many of the plant protection products currently in use will need to be replaced by substances with a lower environmental impact (implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/408). For this reason, many scientific works have focused on developing alternative environmentally friendly measures to the use of pesticides for managing crop diseases [

 <xref rid="B22-antibiotics-09-00628" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. A very promising approach consists in the use of natural compounds such as plant or fungal extracts and their active principles (alkaloids, phenols, monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, isoprenoids), which have been studied for their various antimicrobic and antioxidant properties [

EOs (essential oils) are secondary metabolites accumulated by aromatic or medical plants and extracted from leaves, flowers, roots, and barks. The action of EOs for plant pest control and their possible use in agriculture are well documented [
