<p>Bacterial wilt, a xylem disease causing vascular dysfunction, is caused by Rs, a Gram-negative plant pathogenic bacterium infecting a large range of economically important hosts. The symptomatology in tomato includes wilting of upper leaves, development of adventitious roots along the stem, and wilting of the whole plant in hot humid environmental conditions. A longitudinal section of the stem reveals the presence of a brown discoloration of vascular tissue with leaking of drops of bacterial exudate. Rs can survive for a long time in the soil and infect the plant through wounds; dissemination can also occur through infected propagation material and water. On the basis of scientific and economic impact, Rs is ranked second in the list of top ten phytobacteria [
