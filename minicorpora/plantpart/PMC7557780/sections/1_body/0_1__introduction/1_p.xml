 <italic>Clavibacter michiganensis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>michiganensis</italic> (Smith) Davis, Gillaspies, Vidaver &amp; Harris (Cmm) and 
 <italic>Ralstonia solanacearum</italic> (Smith) Yabuuchi et al. (Rs) are important bacterial pathogens of tomato (
 <italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic> L.), able to cause economic losses worldwide. Cmm, the seed-borne Gram-positive bacterium that is the causal agent of bacterial canker, is considered to be one of the most destructive and economically significant diseases of tomato [
 <xref rid="B1-antibiotics-09-00628" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] in temperate climates and greenhouses worldwide. The disease symptoms observed in plants infected by Cmm are wilt, yellow-brown vascular discoloration, cankers on stems, and petioles and lesions on fruit [
 <xref rid="B2-antibiotics-09-00628" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Cmm is transmitted to flowers and settles internally in developing seeds through vascular tissues [
 <xref rid="B2-antibiotics-09-00628" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], but also externally through tomato fruit lesions [
 <xref rid="B3-antibiotics-09-00628" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]; moreover, it may contaminate the outside of the seed coat [
 <xref rid="B4-antibiotics-09-00628" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. It is reported that one infected seed in 10,000 is able to establish an epidemic [
 <xref rid="B2-antibiotics-09-00628" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5-antibiotics-09-00628" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and a population of 10
 <sup>2</sup> CFU (colony forming units)/seed has been suggested as the probable threshold level for pathogen transmission from naturally infected seeds [
 <xref rid="B6-antibiotics-09-00628" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Latently infected young plants or asymptomatic infections during late stages of plant development, resulting in the production of contaminated seeds, are also considered important for disease spread [
 <xref rid="B7-antibiotics-09-00628" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-antibiotics-09-00628" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-antibiotics-09-00628" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Prevention, based on seed testing and maintaining pathogen-free seeds and transplants, is currently the most appropriate approach for disease control, and cultural practices such as eradication of infected plants and disinfestation of materials are recommended [
 <xref rid="B2-antibiotics-09-00628" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-antibiotics-09-00628" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-antibiotics-09-00628" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Zero tolerance import and export restrictions have been implemented for Cmm in the European Union with the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072 of 28 November 2019.
