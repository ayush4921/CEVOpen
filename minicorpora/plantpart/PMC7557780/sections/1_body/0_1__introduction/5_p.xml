<p>In this work, the EOs of oregano (
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic>), garlic (
 <italic>Allium sativum</italic>), basil (
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic>), cinnamon (
 <italic>Cinnamomum zeylanicum</italic>), clove buds (
 <italic>Syzygium aromaticum</italic>), thyme (
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic>), and Tve were tested in vitro for their antimicrobial activity against Cmm and Rs and their potential phytotoxicity for tomato seeds. These compounds were selected on the basis of results obtained in previous papers concerning other phytopathogenic bacteria [
 <xref rid="B37-antibiotics-09-00628" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and fungi [
 <xref rid="B38-antibiotics-09-00628" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="B39-antibiotics-09-00628" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Besides, a rapid in vivo screening test was developed (based on use of real-time PCR for the specific quantification of Cmm and Rs in the vegetable matrix) to test the antimicrobial efficacy of EOs for seed treatment, without resorting to whole plant essays, which are time- and space-consuming.
