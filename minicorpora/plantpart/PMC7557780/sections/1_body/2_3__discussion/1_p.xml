<p>Bacterial pathogens of tomato crops are a serious problem worldwide; among them, Cmm and Rs are the causal agents of very devastating diseases. Their dangerousness for tomato cultivation is also due to their possible transmissibility by seed. This topic is well documented for Cmm, which is considered a seed-borne pathogen [

 <xref rid="B14-antibiotics-09-00628" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-antibiotics-09-00628" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-antibiotics-09-00628" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], although it was recently confirmed by Dey et al. [
 <xref rid="B15-antibiotics-09-00628" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. At present, there are few strategies to control these bacterial pathogens. The use of antibiotics is illegal in most countries including Europe; the European Union with Reg UE 2018/1981 (EUR-Lex-32018R1981) reduced the use of copper with a maximum amount of 28 kg/ha over a period of 7 years with an average value of 4 kg/ha per year. Currently, guidelines to control the spread of bacteria in the areas of occurrence of the diseases involve prevention and seed control with eco-compatible strategies. In this context, the present study aimed to (i) test the antibacterial efficacy of six EOs and Tve against Cmm and Rs, (ii) develop a rapid assay to verify the efficacy of seed treatments based on testing seedlings by real-time PCR, and (iii) assess the efficacy of cinnamon and oregano EOs for seed treatment to control Cmm.
