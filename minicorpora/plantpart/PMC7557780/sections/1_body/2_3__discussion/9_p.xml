<p>The results of this study confirmed antimicrobic broad-spectrum efficacy of the EOs and Tve and showed promising prospects for their potential use also for seed treatment. However, because the in vitro effects did not always provide a good criterion for their in-vivo performance, further investigations are needed. For this purpose, the molecular test that we performed provides a valid tool to shorten this phase of verifying efficacy in vivo.</p>
