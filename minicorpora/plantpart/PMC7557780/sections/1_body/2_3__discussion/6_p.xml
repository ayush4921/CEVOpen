<p>A rapid in vivo assay has been developed based on the quantification of the two pathogens from the germinated seedlings by real-time PCR, which allowed to quickly and accurately evaluate both bacteria in terms of CFU equivalents. This test represents a valuable rapid screening tool that allows to confirm the efficacy of substances that have proved effective in vitro, without resorting to essays on the whole plant, costly in terms of time and space. Xu et al. [
 <xref rid="B7-antibiotics-09-00628" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] reported that performing DNA extraction just from the aerial part of Cmm-infected seedling allowed to determine the presence of the only vital pathogen inside the plant, as also confirmed by the successfully enrichment step of the positive controls (inoculated not treated).
