<p>As the in vitro results obtained by EOS were very promising thanks to the well-established antibacterial activity, the possible toxic effects on tomato seeds were then evaluated by germination test after treatment by immersion. Previous investigations attempted to identify the potential phytotoxic effect of essential oils and their constituents [

 <xref rid="B51-antibiotics-09-00628" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], but the huge variety of different approaches found in literature and the wide range of methods used for single essential oils or single crop make the overall picture very complex. For this reason, for each oil and crop combination, it is advisable to make specifically targeted studies. Overall, no particular phytotoxic effects have been recorded in the literature for the six EOs tested on tomato seeds. For example, in one study, different essential oils (among them thyme, basil, and clove bud) were applied to tomato seeds without affecting their germination [

 <xref rid="B55-antibiotics-09-00628" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Tve did not show any phytotoxic effects on maize seeds [
 <xref rid="B56-antibiotics-09-00628" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] or wheat plants, resulting from its use as plant growth promoter and elicitor of plant defense [
 <xref rid="B49-antibiotics-09-00628" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In the current research, garlic oil, basil oil, oregano oil, and thyme oil as well as Tve did not affect the germination of tomato seeds, and they can be considered not phytotoxic to tomato up to the concentration of 0.4%. The only case of phytotoxicity was found with clove bud oil at the maximum concentration tested (0.4%). Cinnamon oil also negatively affected seed germination at 0.4%, but such a reduction was so exiguous that it can be considered negligible. Tve represents a novel promising tool to control foliar and kernel diseases of cereals. In this study, for the first time, Tve was tested against tomato bacterial pathogens (Rs and Cmm). According to these results, our studies unveil the effect of Tve whole filtrate (i.e., without any purification step) against bacterial plant pathogenic agents. The results show an interesting antibacterial activity against Rs and Cmm, whereas it had no effects on fungal growth [
