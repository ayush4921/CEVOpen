<p>Besides the antibacterial activity and the phytotoxicity of the six EOs and Tve, in the present study, the in vivo effectiveness of two essential oils (oregano and cinnamon) in relation to seed treatments was evaluated. The choice of these oils was made on the basis of their known strong antibacterial activity and our previous experience with other pathogens [

 <xref rid="B57-antibiotics-09-00628" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,
 <xref rid="B58-antibiotics-09-00628" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,
 <xref rid="B59-antibiotics-09-00628" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. In particular, for Cmm, this antimicrobial efficacy is reported to be related to the high content of thymol and carvacrol [
 <xref rid="B60-antibiotics-09-00628" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] as well as cinnamaldehyde and cinnamic acid [
 <xref rid="B61-antibiotics-09-00628" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], even if significant variations that can occur in the chemical composition are likely to influence their antimicrobial features. Their effective antimicrobial activity makes them suitable for their use as seed treatment against seed-borne disease with the aim of protecting the seeds during sowing and in the very early stages of seedling development. In the available scientific literature, 
 <italic>Oregano dubium</italic> EO was studied as a seed-protectant agent against bean and tomato seed-borne bacterial pathogens, inclusding Cmm, by in vitro and in vivo trials, demonstrating the antibiotic activity against the bacteria studied. The efficacy as seed treatment for bean and tomato was also demonstrated, as it eliminated the seed-borne bacterial pathogens from bean and tomato seeds without affecting their germinability [
 <xref rid="B52-antibiotics-09-00628" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The oregano vulgare subsp. 
 <italic>hirtum</italic> oil was instead tested as tomato seed treatment against 
 <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> pv. 
 <italic>tomato</italic> (
 <italic>Pst</italic>), reducing the seed-borne bacterial speck disease of tomato [
 <xref rid="B53-antibiotics-09-00628" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Concerning cinnamon oil, Dos Santos e Silva [
 <xref rid="B55-antibiotics-09-00628" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] reported a decrease in incidence of fungal pathogens associated with tomato seeds after treatment, but, in general, less information about the cinnamon seed treatment against bacteria in tomato are available.
