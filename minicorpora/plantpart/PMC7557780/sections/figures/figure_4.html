 <caption> Real-time PCR on DNA extracted from seedlings of seeds inoculated with Cmm and treated or not with essential oils (cinnamom and oregano). Significant differences ( p ≤ 0.01) found using the Student Newman test for multiple comparisons are indicated as letters a–c: the same letter means no statistical difference between the treatments. NT: inoculated not treated; H2O: inoculated and treated with water; CIN; inoculated and treated with cinnamon essential oil; ORE: inoculated and treated with oregano essential oil; NI_NT: not inoculated and not treated. </caption>
