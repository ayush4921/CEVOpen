 <caption> Effects of different concentrations of essential oils on Ralstonia solanacearum (Rs) growth measured as optical density (OD) (λ = 620 nm). The concentrations are expressed in ppm. Data reported are the means of two repetitions of the experiment. The error bar shows the standard deviation. Significant differences ( p ≤ 0.01) found using the Tukey-Kramer test for multiple comparison are indicated as letters a–f: the same letter within the same graph means no statistical significance between the treatments. </caption>
