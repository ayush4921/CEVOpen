  <italic>Clavibacter michiganensis</italic> subsp. 
  <italic>michiganensis</italic> (Smith) Davis et al. (Cmm) and 
  <italic>Ralstonia solanacearum</italic> Yabuuchi et al. (Smith) (Rs) are important seed-borne bacterial pathogens of tomato (
  <italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic>) listed as A2 pests in the EPPO (European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization) region. At present, there are few strategies to control these pathogens, and seed control with eco-compatible approaches is widely encouraged. In this work, the essential oils (EOs) of oregano (
  <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic>), garlic (
  <italic>Allium sativum</italic>), basil (
  <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic>), cinnamon (
  <italic>Cinnamomum zeylanicum</italic>), clove buds (
  <italic>Syzygium aromaticum</italic>), thyme (
  <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic>), and 
  <italic>Trametes versicolor</italic> extract (Tve) were tested in vitro for their antimicrobial activity against Cmm and Rs (broth microdilution method). The tested EOs and the Tve extract caused a significant inhibition of bacterial growth, with very promising MBC (minimum bactericidal concentration) and MIC90 (minimum inhibitory concentration causing a 90% growth inhibition) values. Moreover, an in vivo germination test showed no major reduction in seed germination when the substances were applied as seed treatment. A rapid molecular screening method has been developed, through real-time PCR, for the specific quantification of Cmm in the presence of a vegetable matrix to test in vivo the antimicrobial efficacy of oregano and cinnamon oil on seed treatment without resorting to whole plant essays, which are time- and space-consuming.
