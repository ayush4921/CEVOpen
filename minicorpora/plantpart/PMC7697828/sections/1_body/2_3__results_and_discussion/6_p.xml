<p>Another group of metabolites conditioning medicinal and sensory value of oregano herb are phenolics. Phenolic acids and flavonoids reveal various pharmacological activities as well as contribute to the color and flavor profile of plants [

Taking into consideration its extremely high antioxidant and antimicrobial activity, it may be used as a raw material quality marker [

In both subspecies, the consequent increase of this compound (from the beginning of blooming until the beginning of the seed-setting phase) was noticed. Interestingly, a similar pattern was observed in the case of phenolic acids total content (2.65–4.89 and 4.63–6.16 g × 100 g
 <sup>−1</sup> DW, respectively) (
