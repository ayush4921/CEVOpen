<p>When given aromatic plants, including oregano, the problem concerning the content and composition of essential oil seems to be one of the most important, because this substance is responsible for both sensory value and pharmacological activity of the raw material. In the present work, in the case of common oregano, the essential oil content ranged from 0.27 to 0.49 g × 100 g
 <sup>−1</sup> DW, with the maximum noticed at the beginning of plant’s blooming. In turn, in Greek oregano the amount of this substance varied from 2.75 g × 100 g
 <sup>−1</sup> DW (beginning of blooming) to 3.36 (full blooming stage) (

Moreover, obtained results correspond with the phenomenon that the oregano essential oil fluctuates during vegetation season and usually reaches the maximum level at the full blooming stage of plant’s development, therefore this time used to be regarded as the best for harvest [

It is known that many various factors can affect the content and composition of essential oils in aromatic plants, where the most seem to be: genetic, physiological and environmental including temperature, intensity of solar and radiation humidity [
