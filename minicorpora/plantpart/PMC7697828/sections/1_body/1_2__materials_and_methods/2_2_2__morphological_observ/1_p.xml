 <xref rid="B40-foods-09-01671" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Observations were carried out directly before the first harvest of raw material, on 10 plants per subspecies. Following traits were determined: plant growth habit, plant height (cm), number of shoots per plant, number of internodes per shoots, color of petals, branching density, stem pubescence, color of stem, degree of lignification, foliage density, shape of leaf blade, leaf area, leaf margin and shape of leaf apex. Moreover, microscopic observations concerning density of glandular trichomes on abaxial and adaxial surface of the leaves were evaluated, according to the method described by Kosakowska et al. [
