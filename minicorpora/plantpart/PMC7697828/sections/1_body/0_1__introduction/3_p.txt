0: Up to now, Greek oregano cultivation areas have been located mainly within a warmer climate.
1: Recent studies have showed that this subspecies may be cultivated in temperate zone of Central Europe, as well [ 13, 37, 38].
2: However, in Poland, the cultivation of this subspecies is at its infancy [ 18].
3: In turn, common oregano used to be collected in Poland both from natural sites and cultivation [ 28].
4: However, the harvest from the wild may result in heterogeneous raw material.
5: Moreover, the number of wild growing common oregano populations has recently significantly decreased what can lead to genetic erosion.
6: Thus, the collection of common oregano herb exclusively from cultivation would provide natural resources protection as well as ensure high quality of raw material [ 39].
