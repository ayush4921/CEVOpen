<p>Up to now, Greek oregano cultivation areas have been located mainly within a warmer climate. Recent studies have showed that this subspecies may be cultivated in temperate zone of Central Europe, as well [

Moreover, the number of wild growing common oregano populations has recently significantly decreased what can lead to genetic erosion. Thus, the collection of common oregano herb exclusively from cultivation would provide natural resources protection as well as ensure high quality of raw material [
