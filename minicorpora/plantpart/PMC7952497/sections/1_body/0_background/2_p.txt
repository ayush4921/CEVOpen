0: The ever-changing climatic conditions not only affect the life cycle pattern, distribution, phenological, and phytosociological behavior of the plants but it also imposes noticeable stress on genomic organization and consequent change in the phytochemical profile of individual plant species growing under diverse conditions of environmental stresses.
1: The imposed environmental stress affects the gene expression pattern and results in accumulation of diverse categories of secondary metabolites and its derivatives, changing the chemical profile within the individuals of a species growing under diverse ecological niches.
2: These diverse secondary metabolites produced by the plants have ability to produce specific pharmacological responses making particular plant species a potential source of new medicine.
3: The Indian subcontinent exhibits diverse climatic conditions due to prevailing geographical diversity which in turn largely controlled by annual monsoon, appears to be experiencing increasingly severe and erratic precipitation and resultant inter-specific and intra-specific diversity in the plant populations growing under different ecological habitats.
4: Therefore, there is a need to analyze the characteristic chemical profile of the medicinally important plants growing under diverse climatic conditions and to understand how variation in temperature, moisture, and edaphic factors might affect the quality and quantity of pharmacologically valuable secondary metabolites.
5: Some important phytochemicals found in plants are phenolics, alkaloids, terpenoids, glycosides, tannins, flavonoids, saponins, steroids, carbohydrates derivatives, gums, essentials oils, fatty oils, resins, mucilages, etc., that bear diverse pharmacological and pharmacognostic implications [ 3].
