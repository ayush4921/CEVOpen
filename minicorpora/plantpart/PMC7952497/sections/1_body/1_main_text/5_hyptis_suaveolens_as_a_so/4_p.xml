<p id="Par38">Ursolic acid and pentacyclic triterpenoid act as strong protease inhibitor. The molecular docking simulation study based on integrated molecular modulation approach reveal that it act as potential inhibitor of main protease (M

The inhibitions of transcriptase-replicase enzyme adversely affecting the replication and assembly of corona viral particles and thus, ursolic acid and its derivative can emerge as potent therapeutic drug against COVID-19 virus and other life-threatening RNA viruses [

Î²-sitosterol also exhibit antiviral property against COVID-19 virus by targeting the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein of virus interfering with the binding of viral spike protein with angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor on human host cell, blocking the invasion of SARS-CoV2 virus inside the host cell [
