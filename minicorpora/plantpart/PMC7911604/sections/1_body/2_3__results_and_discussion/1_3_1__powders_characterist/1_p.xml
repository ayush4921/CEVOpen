<p>The characteristics of spray-dried emulsions powders are shown in 
 <xref rid="foods-10-00256-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="foods-10-00256-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. One of the most pivotal physical parameters evaluated in case of powders are bulk and tapped densities. It was noticed that the application of FOCE as an emulsifying agent (and partially as a carrier) employed in the presented study was a factor that mostly caused the noticed differences for the bulk and tapped densities of the powders. The highest tapped density (0.432 ± 0.001 g/cm
 <sup>3</sup>) was observed for the powder, with 20% of FO containing FOCE (FOCE-MS-20%), in contrary to the lowest (0.347 ± 0.017 g/cm
 <sup>3</sup>), which was noticed for the sample without FOCE and the same content of oil (MS-20%) (
 <italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.05). Similarly, this powder exhibited the lowest bulk density (0.306 ± 0.015 g/cm
 <sup>3</sup>). This observation indicated that FOCE could be a good carrier and emulsifying agent for spray-dried emulsions with a high oil content. The obtained result for FOCE-based powders were in contrast to the samples with distilled water used as the emulsion liquid phase, where a decrease of bulk and tapped densities with the increase of oil volume were observed (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Based on the bulk and tapped densities, the Carr index (
 <italic>C</italic>) and Hausner ratio (
 <italic>HR</italic>) were calculated. These parameters give an indication of the flowability and cohesiveness of the powders, respectively. Specifically, the Carr index describes the compressibility of a powder. The highest 
 <italic>C</italic> and 
 <italic>HR</italic> were observed for samples FOCE-MS-10% (
 <italic>C-</italic>25.54 ± 0.49 and 
 <italic>HR</italic>-1.29 ± 0.01) and MS-20% (
 <italic>C-</italic>18.01 ± 0.78 and 
 <italic>HR</italic>-1.23 ± 0.12). These results were comparable for the chitosan-based powders [

 <xref rid="foods-10-00256-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, the best properties were exhibited by powder FOCE-MS-20% and was classified as “good”. One of the most reliable criterion to evaluate the behavior of powder in an aqueous solution is solubility. This process is attained after the powder undergoes dissolution and consists of the steps—sinkability, dispersibility, and wettability [
 <xref rid="B17-foods-10-00256" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Additionally, a good solubility is important to obtain a redispersibility of spray-dried emulsion. The powder solubility is often correlated with the type of wall material. Maltodextrin is the one of the most popular polysaccharides used for purposes of the spray-drying microencapsulation. It is characterized by good solubility, and additionally low viscosity at high concentrations, and a neutral aroma and taste [
 <xref rid="B25-foods-10-00256" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. As shown in 
 <xref rid="foods-10-00256-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, all powders showed high solubility and a statistical important difference was observed only between samples FOCE-MS-10% and MS-20% (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). In the case of sample MS-20%, it could be an effect of the higher concentration of maltodextrin in the dry matter of powder, and a lower viscosity of this emulsion. The highest yield was noted for sample MS-10% (57.98 ± 0.53%) and the lowest was observed for FOCE-MS-10% (44.26 ± 0.10%). According to Tonon et al., increasing carrier concentration decreases the process yield [
 <xref rid="B26-foods-10-00256" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This might be an explanation for the decreased yield in this study, which is observed for samples with FOCE. The dry matter content of FOCE was reported at approximately 3% and consists of flaxseed proteins, polysaccharides (flaxseed gum), and another extractable compounds [
 <xref rid="B5-foods-10-00256" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In the presented study, FOCE was used as a liquid phase and its components played the role of emulsifying agents, but should also be calculated for the total solids concentration. The addition of FOCE caused the higher total solids content in the initial emulsions and influenced the process yield, as shown in 
 <xref rid="foods-10-00256-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>.
