 <xref rid="foods-10-00256-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref> summarizes the results of color measurements of emulsions before spray drying and after reconstruction. It could be observed that emulsions without FOCE exhibited higher differences of lightness (L*) as compared to the FOCE-based emulsions (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). A similar tendency was noticed in the case of whiteness and yellowness indices (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The high decrease of lightness in the case samples without FOCE, might be caused by aggregation and destabilization [

 <xref rid="B35-foods-10-00256" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. It is known that the color of an oil-in-water emulsion is changed appreciably over time, due to the droplet growth caused by Ostwald ripening [
 <xref rid="B27-foods-10-00256" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Changes of lightness were in line with the results for ESI and CI. The highest L* decrease was observed for the samples MS-10% and MS-20% and these emulsions exhibited the lowest ESI and the highest differences in creaming indices during storage, between variants A and B. In the case of the sample with FOCE, the lower initial lightness was affected by many factors. Flaxseed oil and FOCE exhibited more yellowness, as previously reported [
 <xref rid="B5-foods-10-00256" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Additionally, maltodextrin is bright white in natural form and could exhibit higher lightness than FOCE [
 <xref rid="B36-foods-10-00256" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. According to Câmara et al. [
 <xref rid="B37-foods-10-00256" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], in the case of more concentrated emulsions, a significant part of the fraction of the incident light could be propagated back to the surface. The observed increase of the b* value in the reconstituted emulsions might be linked to the Maillard reactions during the spray drying process [
 <xref rid="B12-foods-10-00256" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This observation was in line with results reported for the spray-dried FOCE powders [
 <xref rid="B12-foods-10-00256" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Moreover, a similar effect was observed by Verruck et al. [
 <xref rid="B38-foods-10-00256" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] for goat milk spray dried with inulin. Indeed, a significant increase of the yellowness index of all samples after reconstitution was observed (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). In contrast, Pham et al. [
 <xref rid="B39-foods-10-00256" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] suggested that b* increase might be an effect of the formation of phenolics–protein complexes. The ∆E of each samples was higher than 1 and the statistical differences between samples were noticed (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The highest ∆E (14.68 ± 0.01) was observed for the sample MS-10% and the lowest was noticed for FOCE-MS-20% (1.61 ± 0.07). When ∆E was higher than 1, the difference was considered perceptible to the human eye [
 <xref rid="B12-foods-10-00256" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This parameter was a visualization of all changes in sample. Significantly lower values of ∆E were observed for the FOCE-based reconstituted emulsions, as compared to the initial emulsions with water as the liquid phase. Gu et al. [
 <xref rid="B4-foods-10-00256" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] suggested that, in addition to color, emulsions formed by combining protein and polysaccharides are highly stable and resistant to a broad range of environmental stresses. The stress factor in the present study was the spray drying and reconstitution process. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that FOCE not only played the role of emulsifier, but additionally prevented emulsion destabilization caused by stress factors.
