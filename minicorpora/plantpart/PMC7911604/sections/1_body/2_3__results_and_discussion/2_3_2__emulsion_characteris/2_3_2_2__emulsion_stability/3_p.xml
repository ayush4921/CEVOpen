<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00256-f003">Figure 3</xref>, the emulsions without FOCE represented higher 
 <italic>CI</italic> and started creaming after 24 h (
 <italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.05). Moreover, for these samples, the creaming index increased with an increased oil volume. These emulsions (initial and reconstituted) exhibited very high differences after 168 h, especially in the case of a sample with 10% oil (A—47.50 ± 0.71% and B—76.00 ± 1.41%). On the other hand, the creaming of samples with FOCE started after 48 h (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). In the case of samples with FOCE after 24 h, the creaming index was 0% and the sample was stable (
 <italic>p &gt;</italic> 0.05). Based on this observation, it is reasonable to conclude that FOCE has the ability to prevent emulsion creaming during storage, both before and after reconstitution from spray-dried powders.
