<p>Creaming is one of the most common mechanism of emulsion instability, causing macroscopic phase separation into cream and serum layers [
 <xref rid="B29-foods-10-00256" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Creaming index provides information about the extent and viscosity of droplet aggregation in an emulsion. Emulsions with a low creaming index and a low creaming rate present a good creaming behavior, resulting in a good emulsion stability. Additionally, the

Rapid creaming could be an effect of exceeding a critical maltodextrin concentration. Many authors suggest that the high concentration of maltodextrin might cause the flocculation of droplets by unabsorbed maltodextrin molecules in the aqueous phase of the emulsion [

 <xref rid="B32-foods-10-00256" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Klinkesorn et al. [
 <xref rid="B23-foods-10-00256" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] observed that non-adsorbed polymers generate an osmotic force between droplets, which increases with growing polymer concentration. Finally, it becomes large enough to overcome the repulsive forces acting between the droplets. The better creaming stability of FOCE-based emulsions could be explained as the ratio of bound biopolymer concentration and type. According to Chanamai and McClements [
 <xref rid="B34-foods-10-00256" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], the increase of biopolymers such as starch or maltodextrin in the aqueous phase caused higher viscosity and slowed down the upward movements in emulsions.
