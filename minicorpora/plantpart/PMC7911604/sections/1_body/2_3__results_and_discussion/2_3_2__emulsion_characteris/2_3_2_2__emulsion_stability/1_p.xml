 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00256-f003">Figure 3</xref> present the stability of the initial (A) and reconstituted (B) emulsions, expressed as ESI and CI. The emulsions based on FOCE showed significantly higher ESI than the emulsions where distilled water was used as the liquid phase (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). However, for all samples, a significant decrease of ESI after reconstitution was noticed (
 <italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.05). The highest ESI was noticed for the initial FOCE-MS-20% sample (2970.00 ± 0.00 min). Moreover, it could be observed that emulsions with FOCE showed a significantly higher ESI in case of samples with a 20% content of oil (A—2970.00 ± 0.00 min; B—1465.50 ± 0.50 min) than with 10% (A—1201.25 ± 0.52 min; B—566.67 ± 0.00 min) (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). These results were opposite to samples without FOCE. Emulsions with distilled water as a liquid phase represented lower ESI values when the oil fraction increased. Maltodextrin and starch exhibited emulsifying properties, but these mechanisms were quite different than that for the protein and polysaccharides included in FOCE. As previously reported, the FOCE emulsifying activity is a result of synergistic action of its two main fractions—protein and gum [
 <xref rid="B5-foods-10-00256" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Flaxseed protein adsorbs onto the oil–water surface over the emulsification process. Due to the presence of polysaccharides such as flaxseed gum steric and mechanical effects, the emulsion system could be stabilized by the highly branched polysaccharide structure. Additionally, flaxseed gum and flaxseed protein have the ability to reduce the surface tension [

 <xref rid="B29-foods-10-00256" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Presumably maltodextrin and starch influenced the stability of emulsions, by increasing the viscosity and ability to gelation of the aqueous continuous phase surrounding the oil droplets [

 <xref rid="B18-foods-10-00256" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Thus, the use of various combinations of maltodextrin and other compounds such as proteins and polysaccharides for the purpose of microencapsulation is suggested [

 <xref rid="B30-foods-10-00256" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Starches such as OSA or Capsul
 <sup>®</sup> were selected as wall materials, due to their amphiphilic nature and the consequent biosafety of their derivatives [
 <xref rid="B31-foods-10-00256" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Capsul
 <sup>®</sup> used in this study was a chemically modified starch, produced by incorporating a lipophilic component (using octenyl succinic anhydride), aimed at conferring emulsifying properties [
 <xref rid="B32-foods-10-00256" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. As a result of this modification, hydrophilic starch gains hydrophobic octenyl groups, resulting in molecules of an amphiphilic nature [
