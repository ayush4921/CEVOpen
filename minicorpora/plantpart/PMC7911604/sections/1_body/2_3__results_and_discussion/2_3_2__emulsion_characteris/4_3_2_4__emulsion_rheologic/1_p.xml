<p>The rheological parameters of the initial (A) and reconstituted emulsions (B) based on the Hershelâ€“Bulkey model are presented in 
 <xref rid="foods-10-00256-t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>, and their flow curves are illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00256-f004">Figure 4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00256-f005">Figure 5</xref>. Based on the flow curves and n value a mixed rheological character of the emulsions was noticed. The n less than 1 indicated that the emulsion exhibited Newtonian character [
 <xref rid="B22-foods-10-00256" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In the case of the initial FOCE-MS-10%, MS-10%, and MS-20%, a non-Newtonian character of the samples was observed. It could be observed that these samples exhibited an n value indicated by a nearly Newtonian character, after the reconstitution process. A similar flow behavior was reported for the flaxseed oil-in-water emulsions stabilized with whey protein isolate (WPI) [
 <xref rid="B40-foods-10-00256" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], as well as for avocado oil-in-water emulsions stabilized by WPI/maltodextrin [
 <xref rid="B41-foods-10-00256" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Based on the results of the emulsions flow behavior after reconstitution, it could be concluded that all samples had a nearly shear thinning behavior. A similar observation was reported by Kumar et al. in case of emulsions with chitozan as a wall material [
 <xref rid="B25-foods-10-00256" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. After the spray drying process, each emulsion exhibited a lower yield stress value and a lower viscosity (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), only sample MS-20% was an exception. The viscosity of the initial emulsions decreased with the increase of oil volume. The same observations were made by Kurek and Pratap-Singh in case of emulsions with various plant protein (hemp, pea, and rice), in combination with maltodextrin [
 <xref rid="B42-foods-10-00256" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Additionally, this trend was observed by Di Giorgio et al. [
 <xref rid="B43-foods-10-00256" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] for emulsions with soya protein, which are often compared to flaxseed protein due to their similarity [
 <xref rid="B13-foods-10-00256" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The observed higher viscosity of the samples with FOCE after reconstitution, was in line with this effect described by Boonalao et al. [
 <xref rid="B44-foods-10-00256" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], in the case of xanthan gum. The addition of polysaccharides such as xanthan gum, which is often compared to flaxseed gum, increases the viscosity of aqueous solutions, enhancing their stability, because it prevents the movement of droplets, which causes creaming. In terms of consistency index, the samples with FOCE indicated the tendency of an increase in K with an increase in oil volume, which was contrary to the samples without FOCE (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Results obtained for the MS-10% and MS-20% samples were in agreement with the results reported by Kumar et al. [
 <xref rid="B25-foods-10-00256" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], who observed that the consistency index had a lower value in emulsions (stabilized by hemp, rice, and pea protein), with a 20% oil content, than in emulsions with a lower oil content.
