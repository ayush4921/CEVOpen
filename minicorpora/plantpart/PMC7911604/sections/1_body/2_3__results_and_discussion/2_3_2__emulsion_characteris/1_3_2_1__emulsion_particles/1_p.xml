<p>The particles size distribution changes in the emulsion samples before and after reconstitution are presented in 
 <xref rid="foods-10-00256-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00256-f001">Figure 1</xref>. The droplet size was essential for the stability of the emulsion, as emulsions with a controlled particle size exhibited greater stability. Moreover, it was suggested that the smaller the droplets, the higher was the emulsion stability [
 <xref rid="B5-foods-10-00256" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In fact, the lowest D
 <sub>4,3</sub> (2.693 ± 0.00 µm) and D
 <sub>3,2</sub> (2.166 ± 0.01 µm) after reconstitution were observed for the sample FOCE-MS-20%. As could be seen, the results of the emulsions stability were in line with the decreasing particle size distribution. It was observed that the surface area (D
 <sub>3.2</sub>) decreased after reconstitution in the FOCE-based emulsions (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). On the contrary, for samples MS-10% and MS-20%, an increase was noticed (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The obtained results were supported by the captures presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00256-f001">Figure 1</xref>. Emulsions with FOCE were more concentrated before spray drying, which presumably influenced their stability after reconstitution. Additionally, it could be observed that the spray drying process caused a higher concentration of emulsions in samples without FOCE. Sample MS-20% exhibited exceptionally low stability, as previously described. A tendency of agglomeration for the particles, before and after spray drying, was observed. These results were in line with the creaming index of the sample. In samples with FOCE, the observed distribution was similar before and after spray drying, therefore, it could also be concluded that the spray drying only decreased the particle size and surface area and did not cause a negative reaction such as flocculation or Ostwald ripening. According to Koç et al. [
 <xref rid="B1-foods-10-00256" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], the increase of surface area was a negative phenomenon because the oil droplets might not be effectively covered by wall materials, and finally the stability of emulsions could be lower. Thus, the maltodextrin–starch mix used as a wall material should be additionally supported by some emulsifying agent for spray drying, and FOCE could be useful for this process, as demonstrated in the case of FOCE-based emulsions. The particle size in emulsions had a significant influence on their long-term stability, because the creaming velocity of an individual droplet was directly proportional to the square of its radius and to the density difference between the dispersed and the continuous phase [
 <xref rid="B27-foods-10-00256" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. It is recommended that the emulsion stability be evaluated with several indicators, because the stability effect is a synergy of oil binding, water holding, the rheological properties, and particle adhesion. According to Aizawa [
 <xref rid="B28-foods-10-00256" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], turbidity measurements such as ESI are related to the size and number of oil droplets present in the emulsion. Thus, the variation in emulsion turbidity could indicate the changes of particles size and dispersity. In unstable emulsions, several changes could be observed, especially in the increasing particle size and concentrations, due to the coagulation and coalescence of particles. An observed increase in particle size of samples without FOCE, after the spray drying process could indicate emulsion stability disturbances.
