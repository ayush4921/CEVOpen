<p>This study concluded that FOCE might be applied to stabilize spray-dried flaxseed oil-in-water reconstructable emulsions, which are not described so far. Despite the ability of starch and maltodextrin for emulsion stabilization, these mechanisms were insufficient to obtain long-term stable emulsions. Thus, maltodextrin and starch could have only played the role of wall material. FOCE could be an adequate emulsifier for the spray-dried emulsions, with a high oil content providing their high stability, after reconstitution, when compared to emulsions based only on a maltodextrinâ€“starch wall material, with water as the liquid phase. Based on our findings, it is reasonable to conclude that FOCE could be an alternative bio-based emulsifier used for microencapsulated functional foods. Furthermore, powdered flaxseed oil emulsions with FOCE could also be applied as a raw material during the production of processed food and as fat bases for the dairy and meat industries. Moreover, there is a potential for these products to be used in pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and cosmetical applications, where nature-based solutions are desired. The proposed solution fits the rules of the circular economy and the idea of zero-waste.</p>
