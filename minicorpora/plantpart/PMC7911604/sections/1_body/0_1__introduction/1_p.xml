<p>Spray drying is one of the most approachable techniques of microencapsulation, which is prized, simple, and flexible because many parameters (such as inlet and outlet temperature, nozzle size, etc.) could be adjusted. Microencapsulation is described as coating individual particles or droplets with a continuous phase, to obtain capsules in a micrometer to millimeter in size [

Spray drying process conditions should be well chosen because they affect the physical properties of the powders, obtained over the experiment. For example, process yield, moisture content, particles size, bulk density, color, solubility, and ability for reconstitution. Due to the notable benefits, the spray drying technology finds wide applications in various sectors, such as food, chemical, pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, cosmetic, and biomedical industries.
