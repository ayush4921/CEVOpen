0: Spray drying is one of the most approachable techniques of microencapsulation, which is prized, simple, and flexible because many parameters (such as inlet and outlet temperature, nozzle size, etc.)
1: could be adjusted.
2: Microencapsulation is described as coating individual particles or droplets with a continuous phase, to obtain capsules in a micrometer to millimeter in size [ 1].
3: Spray drying is defined as transformation of a feed from liquid state to a powder by spraying into a hot drying gas [ 2].
4: Spray drying process conditions should be well chosen because they affect the physical properties of the powders, obtained over the experiment.
5: For example, process yield, moisture content, particles size, bulk density, color, solubility, and ability for reconstitution.
6: Due to the notable benefits, the spray drying technology finds wide applications in various sectors, such as food, chemical, pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, cosmetic, and biomedical industries.
