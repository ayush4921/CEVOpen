<p>The particle size distribution of emulsions was performed using a Mastersizer 2000 (Malvern Instrument Ltd., Worcestershire, UK). The initial and reconstituted emulsion samples were gently diluted with 0.1% SDS solution, then dispersed in distilled water (stirred speed—2000 rpm) to obtain an obscuration rate of 10%. The optical properties of the sample were defined as follows—refractive index 1500 and absorption 1.00. Droplet size measurements were described as the volume-weighted mean diameter d
 <sub>4,3</sub> = ∑n
 <sub>i</sub>d
 <sub>4i</sub>/∑n
 <sub>i</sub>d
 <sub>i3</sub> and d
 <sub>3,2</sub> = ∑n
 <sub>i</sub>d
 <sub>3i</sub>/∑n
 <sub>i</sub>d
 <sub>i2</sub>, where n
 <sub>i</sub> is the number of droplets of diameter d
