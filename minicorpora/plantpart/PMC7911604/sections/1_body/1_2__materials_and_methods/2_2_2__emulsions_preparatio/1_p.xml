<p>The processing of FOC into Flaxseed Oil Cake Extract (FOCE) (used as a liquid phase) was carried out following the procedure described elsewhere [
 <xref rid="B5-foods-10-00256" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Starch Capsul
 <sup>®</sup> and maltodextrin were used as a wall material in the ratio 1:1 (8.5 g of each per 100 mL of FOCE). The wall components were added to the liquid phase at 25 °C and the mixture was stirred (250 rpm) until completely dissolved (approximately 15 min). FO was then added to the solution at a concentration of 10% and 20%, with respect to the total solids content of mixture. The model emulsions were prepared in two steps. First, the mixtures were mixed with FO for 5 min (500 rpm) using a magnetic stirrer (IKA, Staufen, Germany). Then, the mixtures were homogenized for 5 min at 1500 rpm (Magic LAB UTC, IKA, Staufen, Germany). The reference samples (used distilled water as a liquid phase), which served for comparison, were treated in the same way. The obtained variants are summarized in
