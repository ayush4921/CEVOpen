<p>Rabie et al. [
 <xref rid="B86-plants-10-00318" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>] also made biscuits fortified with 
 <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> leaf powder and seed powder in different concentrations, ranging from 2.5% to 7.5%. Their results found that supplementation with 
 <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> leaf powder has a higher amount of protein, ash, crude fibre, dietary fibre and minerals, while seed powder is characterised by a higher content of fat, protein, dietary fibre and minerals, and when mixed, a higher amount of essential amino acids was achieved, and when compared to the control, the biscuits with 
 <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> incorporation showed a lower carbohydrate content.
