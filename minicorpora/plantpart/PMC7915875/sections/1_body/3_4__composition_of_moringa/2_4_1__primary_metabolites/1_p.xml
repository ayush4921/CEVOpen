 <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> leaf is a rich source of minerals, such as calcium, potassium, zinc, magnesium, iron, phosphorus and copper [
 <xref rid="B23-plants-10-00318" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], where it is represented in 
 <xref rid="plants-10-00318-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. One of the characteristics of the leaf is its high protein content, due to the essential amino acids, which constitute about 30% of its weight, being comparable to milk powder which contains 35%, and is available all year round, as the protein and essential amino acid content is present in the leaves, unlike other plants which contain them in the seeds [

 <xref rid="B25-plants-10-00318" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], reporting a protein content of 29.4 g protein/100 g dry weight in the leaves. Thus, 
 <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> can be considered a new source of protein to be included in food, like chia seed, with a protein content of 24 g protein/100 g dry weight [
 <xref rid="B26-plants-10-00318" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Regarding carbohydrates, its level is lower (8.1%) [
 <xref rid="B27-plants-10-00318" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] compared to the other parts of the plant, as can be seen in 
 <xref rid="plants-10-00318-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. In addition, fibres were also found, with a value ranging between 18.1 and 21.1 g/100 g dry weight of the leaves [
