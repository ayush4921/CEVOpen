<p>The leaves are noted for high levels of Î²-carotene and provide more vitamin A than carrots and pumpkin [

They are also a good source of B vitamins (quoted from the book tree miracle), among which thiamine, riboflavin and niacin have been found, with a concentration between 0.06 and 0.6 mg/100 g, 0.05 and 0.17 mg/100 g and 0.8 and 0.82 mg/100 g for thiamine, riboflavin and niacin, respectively. In the dried leaf, their concentrations were 2.85, 22.16 and 8.86 mg/100 g DW, respectively [
