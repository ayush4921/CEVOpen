<p>The antimicrobial effect provided essential oils from the leaves and alcoholic extracts of the seeds. In fact, Chuang et al. [
 <xref rid="B48-plants-10-00318" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] demonstrated this activity of the leaf and leaves against dermatophytes such as

In addition to these compounds, other compounds have been found that also produce this effect, 4(βL-rhamnosyloxy) benzyl isocyanate or pterigospermine,4-(β-D-glucopyranosyl-1→4-β-l-ramnopyranosyloxy),benzyl thiocarboxamide,(-)-Catechin, phenylmethanamine, 4β-D-glucopyranosyl-1--&gt;4 β-L-rhamnopyranosyloxy)-benzyl isocyanate, niazirine [
