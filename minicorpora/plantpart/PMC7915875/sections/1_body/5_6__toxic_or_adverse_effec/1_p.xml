 <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> is not entirely safe, as many studies have found various compounds that have been associated with major liver, kidney, haematological and other diseases. Roasted 
 <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> seeds contain potential mutagens such as 4-(Î±-lramnopyranosyloxy)-benzylglucosinolate, which increase the proportion of micronucleated polychromatophilic erythroblasts, indicative of some degree of genotoxicity [
