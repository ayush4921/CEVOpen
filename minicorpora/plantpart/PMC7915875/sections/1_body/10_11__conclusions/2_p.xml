<p>The incorporation of 
 <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> will increase the nutritional value, improving the contribution of macro and micronutrients, of which proteins, fibres, vitamins and minerals are the most important, however, there is a difference when using the leaves versus the seed of 
 <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic>, as the latter will increase the value of lipids, which is not a characteristic of the leaves. In all cases, high concentrations alter the physical and sensory characteristics of the supplemented products. In most studies, 
 <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> has been used in bread, biscuits and brownies, giving us clues to follow in bakery or bakery products due to their similarity in ingredients and types of preparations. It is possible to develop food products based on 
 <italic>Moringa Oleifera</italic> flour with acceptable sensory and nutritional properties when less than 20 g of this material is used, depending on the intended food product.
