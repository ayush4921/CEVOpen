0: It can withstand long periods of drought, growing well in arid and semi-arid areas.
1: According to researchers, it tolerates soils with a pH between 4.5 and 8, although neutral or slightly acidic pH is more favourable [ 9]; it is a very adaptable species, lives about 20 years and reaches a height of 5 to 10 m in a short period of time, reaching 4 m in 6 months [ 10].
2: It is considered a very versatile plant due to its great capacity to provide edible food, which includes different vegetative structures, such as leaves, pod shells, stem, flowers, fruits and seeds.
3: These structures contain bioactive compounds and nutrients ( Figure 1), such as phenolic compounds, fatty acids, carbohydrates, fibre, minerals, vitamins and functional peptides with a wide potential to be used in food.
