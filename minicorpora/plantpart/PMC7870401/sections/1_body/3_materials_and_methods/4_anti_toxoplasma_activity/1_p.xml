<p>HFF cells were grown at 100 µl/well in 96-well microtiter plates (cell suspension 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/ml in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS) and incubated at 37°C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere for 48 hr. Then, the cells were infected with 
 <italic>T. gondii</italic> RH-GFP (5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> tachyzoites/ well) for 4 hr, and the extracellular parasites were removed. Afterward, the infected cells were subjected to the herbal extracts prepared in DMEM. All plant extracts (methanol and oil extracts) were tested for their anti-
 <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> activity at 50 and 10 µg/ml. Then, the plant extracts showing percentage inhibition of RH-GFP growth at 50 µg/ml higher than that produced by sulfadiazine were investigated at concentrations (0.5–100 µg/ml) to determine their IC
 <sub>50</sub> values against 
 <italic>T. gondii</italic>. Sulfadiazine and media were added as positive and negative controls, respectively. After 3 days of incubation, a microplate reader (GloMax-Multi Detection System, Promega, Madison, WI, USA) was used to measure the fluorescence intensity of RH-GFP. The growth inhibition (%) of RH-GFP was determined as reported previously [
 <xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of the herbal extract on 
 <italic>T. gondii</italic> were determined with the aid of GraphPad Prism 5 software.
