<p>The antifungal activity of 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> essential oils from Sesimbra (Estremadura, Portugal) was observed against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> [
 <xref rid="B21-pharmaceuticals-13-00479" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The antifungal capacity of the 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> essential oil against 
 <italic>Candida</italic> spp. have also been evaluated through the macrodilution method that enables the determination of MIC and MLC [
 <xref rid="B26-pharmaceuticals-13-00479" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Flow cytometry was also used as a complementary method for the study of the mechanisms responsible for antifungal activity. 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> essential oil showed higher inhibition compared to the other 
 <italic>Thymus</italic> species tested, with a lower MIC concentration obtained for 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> against 
 <italic>Candida</italic> spp. varied from 1.25 to 10.00 μL/mL, depending on the species of 
 <italic>Candida</italic>, while the MLC remained at 5 μL/mL for almost all species. This study described the potent antifungal activity of 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> essential oil against 
 <italic>Candida</italic> spp., warranting future therapeutic trials on mucocutaneous candidosis. Compared with other studies, similar MIC values for 
 <italic>Candida</italic> were found using 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> essential oil from Portugal [
 <xref rid="B4-pharmaceuticals-13-00479" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. A remarkable increase in antifungal activity of the mixture of extracts of 
 <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic>, 
 <italic>Salvia lavandulifolia</italic>, 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic>, and chitosan against different yeasts (
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, 
 <italic>Pichia anomala</italic>, 
 <italic>Pichia membranaefaciens</italic>, and 
 <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>) and filamentous fungi (
 <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> and 
 <italic>Penicillium digitatum</italic> strains belonging to the collection of fungi isolated from citrus) was observed [
 <xref rid="B53-pharmaceuticals-13-00479" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. However, the results obtained did not enable the determination of MICs or minimum fungicidal concentrations (MFCs) because the values were higher than the maximum concentrations tested. Additionally, the fungicide activity of 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> extracts (at 20–25 mg/mL) from plants micropropagated in vitro against 
 <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> was demonstrated for the first time [
 <xref rid="B56-pharmaceuticals-13-00479" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. In another study, the antifungal capacity of 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> essential oil was determined against 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> spp. using the agar dilution method. 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> essential oil showed antifungal activity against pathogenic fungi strains of the genus 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> with MICs and MFCs ranging from 1500 to 2100 μg/mL and from 2.0 to 2.4 mg/mL, respectively. In this study, the antifungal activity of the two main constituents, 1,8-cineole and linalool, was also evaluated and considering the obtained MICs and MFCs, the antifungal activity of the essential oil seemed to be due to the presence of major constituents [
