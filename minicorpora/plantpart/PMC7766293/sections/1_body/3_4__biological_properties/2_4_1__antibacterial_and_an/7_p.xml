<p>Gram-negative bacteria (
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic>, and 
 <italic>Enterobacter aerogenes</italic>) and Gram-positive bacteria (
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> and methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>) were used for determination of MIC, through dilution and microdilution techniques, of a mixture of extracts of 
 <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic>, 
 <italic>Salvia lavandulifolia</italic>, 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic>, and chitosan [
 <xref rid="B53-pharmaceuticals-13-00479" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. All tested extracts demonstrated noticeable antimicrobial activities against spoilage and foodborne pathogens such as 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic>, methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>E. aerogenes</italic>, 
 <italic>S. enterica</italic>, and yeast-like fungi, without interference in sensory properties. Vieira et al. [
 <xref rid="B45-pharmaceuticals-13-00479" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] also observed 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> essential oil activity, with MIC values of 15 mg/mL (
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>) and 20 mg/mL (methicillin-sensitive 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>); and the same pattern for MLC, with a value of 40 mg/mL for 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 30 mg/mL for 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, and 70 mg/mL for 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, and suggesting this aromatic plant to be used in control pathogenic microorganisms in deteriorating foods. In another study, the antibacterial activity of 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> essential oil was assayed in vitro by a microdilution method against both Gram-positive (
 <italic>Listeria innocua</italic>, methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, and 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic>) and Gram-negative bacteria (
 <italic>S. enterica</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>). In this study, the inhibition percentage increased with the 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> essential oil concentration and higher inhibition was observed for 
 <italic>L. innocua</italic> [
 <xref rid="B44-pharmaceuticals-13-00479" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Furthermore, the antimicrobial activity of whey protein isolate-based edible films incorporated with 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> essential oil were tested against Gram-positive bacteria (
 <italic>L. innocua</italic> and methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>) and Gram-negative bacteria (
 <italic>S. enteritidis</italic> and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas fragi</italic>) to be useful as a coating in the food industry. In this context, it should be highlighted that the antimicrobial activity was only observed against 
 <italic>L. innocua</italic> and using the whey protein films containing 7% and 8% of 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> essential oil [
 <xref rid="B34-pharmaceuticals-13-00479" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This work suggests the possibility of using films incorporating essential oils on food systems.
