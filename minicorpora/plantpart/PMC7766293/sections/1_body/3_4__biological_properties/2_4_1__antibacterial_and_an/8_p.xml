<p>The active antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> essential oil (30 μL) applied through the disk-diffusion method was confirmed by Ballester-Costa et al. [
 <xref rid="B35-pharmaceuticals-13-00479" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] against 
 <italic>L. innocua</italic> and 
 <italic>Alcaligenes faecalis</italic>, 
 <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic>, 
 <italic>Enterobacter amnigenus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Enterobacter gergoviae</italic>, but not active against 
 <italic>P. fragi, Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic>, 
 <italic>Aeromonas hydrophila</italic>, 
 <italic>Shewanella putrefaciens</italic>, 
 <italic>Achromobacter denitrificans</italic>, and 
 <italic>E. gergoviae</italic>. Additionally, MIC of 
 <italic>T. matichina</italic> essential oil determined by microdilution assay was between 3.75 and 7.5 μL/mL for all strains. The differences obtained in both methods are related to the lower dispersion of the essential oils on a solid medium and consequently reduced ability to access to the microorganism in the disk diffusion method, confirming the unreliability of this method for essential oil evaluation. Posteriorly, the same authors tested the effect of chitosan edible film disks incorporated with the essential oil of 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> at concentrations of 1% and 2% against 
 <italic>L. innocua, S. marcescens</italic>, 
 <italic>E. amnigenus</italic>, and 
 <italic>A. faecalis</italic>. At both concentrations, antibacterial activity was observed for 
 <italic>S. marcescens</italic>, 
 <italic>L. innocua</italic>, and 
 <italic>A. faecalis</italic>, with activity against 
 <italic>S. marcescens</italic> being higher. However, antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>E. amnigenus</italic> was not registered [
 <xref rid="B54-pharmaceuticals-13-00479" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Besides, in the following year, they evaluated the activity of 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> essential oil (30 μL), applied through the disk-diffusion method, against the bacteria 
 <italic>A. denitrificans</italic>, 
 <italic>A. faecalis</italic>, 
 <italic>A. hydrophila</italic>, 
 <italic>E. amnigenus</italic>, 
 <italic>E. gergoviae</italic>, 
 <italic>L. innocua</italic>, 
 <italic>P. fluorescens</italic>, 
 <italic>P. fragi, S. marcescens</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. putrefaciens</italic> using, as culture medium, extracts from meat homogenates (minced beef, cooked Ham, or dry-cured sausage). 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> essential oils were extremely active against 
 <italic>L. innocua</italic> in minced beef and active for 
 <italic>A. hydrophila</italic> in dry-cured sausage, while for the remaining bacteria only moderate activity or absence of activity was found [
 <xref rid="B55-pharmaceuticals-13-00479" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. In this way, it was suggested the use of 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> essential oil as a “green” preservative agent in the food industry, per se or incorporated in edible films. In addition, it should be highlighted that its efficacy as an antibacterial agent has been demonstrated in model systems that closely simulate food composition.
