<p>In recent years, plants have been identified for their insecticidal or larvicidal properties and used to control insect vectors offering an economically viable and ecofriendly approach. One of the studies was based on exposing 
 <italic>Spodoptera littoralis</italic> larvae to 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> essential oil and verifying larval mortality. The essential oil was highly toxic with a lethal concentration at 50% (LC
 <sub>50</sub>) of 19.3 mL/m
 <sup>3</sup> when applied by fumigation. After topical application, 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic> essential oil was also highly toxic with a LC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.034 μL/larvae [

 <italic>Musca domestica</italic> L.) and determined a topical LD
 <sub>50</sub> of 33 μg/fly and fumigant LD
 <sub>50</sub> of 7.3 μg/cm
