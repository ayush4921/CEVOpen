<p>All bacterial strains were kept frozen in glycerol stocks at −80 °C. Frozen bacterial strains were activate in tryptic soy broth (TSA, BTL, Warsaw, Poland) at 37 °C for 24 h in an aerobic condition. Next, the bacterial strains were transfer and diluted in sterile 0.85% saline solution (NaCl, POCH, Gliwice, Poland) to adjusted 0.5 on the McFarland turbidity scale (Densimat, bioMérieux, Marcy l’Etoile, France), which is equivalent to 1 × 10
