<p>The antioxidant potential of selected extracts obtained from some

 <xref rid="B68-molecules-26-00988" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Based on these data, it seems that the antioxidant activity is related to the solvent polarity, however, some inconsistency may be noticed there. For instance, Kaurinovic et al. [

 <xref rid="B38-molecules-26-00988" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] indicate on the aqueous extract as the most effective one, while Licina et al. [
 <xref rid="B67-molecules-26-00988" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] higlighted the ethanolic extract. It is worth noting that aqueous extracts are rarely used in the industry, in favor of hydroethanolic ones. The results obtained in the present study show that the antioxidant power of hydroethanolic extracts from Greek oregano and common oregano was at a similar level (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00988-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). As it was mentioned earlier, the antioxidant activity of plants extracts is usually attributed to the presence of phenolic compounds, mainly phenolic acids and flavonoids. However, the chemical composition of phenolicâ€™s fraction of investigated extracts was not identical (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00988-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Greek oregano extract includes a considerable content of lithospermic acid B, regarded as a strong antioxidant agent [

 <xref rid="B70-molecules-26-00988" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. In general, common oregano extract is characterized by higher content of flavonoids, while Greek oregano contains more phenolic acids. This might provide to almost equal antioxidant activity of both investigated extracts
