<p>Greek oregano and common oregano hydroethanolic extracts differed in the content of determined phenolic acids and flavonoids. Regarding phenolic acids, five compounds were identified, namely: protocatechuic, caffeic, chlorogenic, rosmarinic and lithospermic B acids. In both subspecies, rosmarinic acid was the dominant compound (10,809.37 mg × 100 g
 <sup>−1</sup> in Greek oregano and 8260.68 mg × 100 g
 <sup>−1</sup> in common oregano). In the case of Greek oregano, the high content of rosmarinic acid was followed by a considerable amount of lithospermic acid B (7065.67 mg × 100 g
 <sup>−1</sup>) and chlorogenic acid (56.81 mg × 100 g
 <sup>−1</sup>). Interestingly, both compounds were not found in common oregano. In general, protocatechiuc, caffeic and chlorogenic acids were detected in visibly lower quantities in comparison to rosmarinic and lithospermic B ones. The content of caffeic acid appeared to be similar both in Greek oregano and common oregano (98.55 and 91.98 mg × 100 g
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively), whereas the content of protocatechuic acid was almost three times higher in common oregano extract when compared to Greek oregano (

 <xref rid="B57-molecules-26-00988" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. According to Węglarz et al. [
 <xref rid="B55-molecules-26-00988" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] common oregano contains also 
 <italic>p</italic>-hydroxybenzoic, vanillic and 
 <italic>o</italic>-coumaric acid, while Raduciene et al. [
 <xref rid="B54-molecules-26-00988" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] showed the presence of chlorogenic acid in this subspecies. The results obtained by Grevsen et al. [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-26-00988" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] indicate that Greek oregano is a rich source not only of rosmarinic acid, but also of lithospermic acid B and its derivative (epi-lithospermic acid B), what is in an agreement with our work. It is worth noting that the level of rosmarinic acid is quite variable between 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> chemotypes [
 <xref rid="B58-molecules-26-00988" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. For instance, in research performed by Lukas et al. [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-26-00988" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], the content of this compound varied from 0.6 to 37.2 mg × g
 <sup>−1</sup> in common oregano populations growing wild in Austria. Such a wide range of content suggests that rosmarinic acid, like terpenes, may be used as a marker of intraspecific variability. Moreover, when given its biological activity, this acid in plant material appears to be desirable from a pharmacological point of view [
