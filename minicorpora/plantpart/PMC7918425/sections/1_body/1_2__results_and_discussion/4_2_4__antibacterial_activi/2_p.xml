<p>In general, the activity of Greek oregano essential oil against the tested bacterial strains was at least three times higher when compared to the activity of common oregano essential oil. Here, Greek oregano essential oil effectively inhibited the growth of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, with MIC values ranging from 0.25 to 1 mg × mL
 <sup>−1</sup> and MBC values from 0.5 to 2 mg × mL
 <sup>−1</sup>. In turn, common oregano essential oil showed higher MIC values (2–8 mg × mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) and MBC (4–16 mg × mL
 <sup>−1</sup>), which is equivalent to less effective antibacterial activity compared of Greek oregano essential oil. Moreover, common oregano essential oil showed the weakest bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity on 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCC 25923 in the examined range of concentrations (MIC = 32; MBC = 64 mg × mL
 <sup>−1</sup>). Taking into account MIC and MBC values, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> ATCC 25922 and O157:H7 ATCC 700728 appeared to be the most susceptible bacteria among tested strains. It seems that Gram-negative bacteria were more sensitive to the essential oils used in comparison to Gram-positive ones (

One mode of action of essential oil compounds (especially thymol and carvacrol) is the rapid depletion of the intracellular ATP pool through the reduction of ATP synthesis. As a result, the decrease of intracellular ATP content followed by proton motive force finally enhance the permeability of the membrane. The leakage of ions from the cell provide to membrane damage resulting in disturbances of the osmotic pressure of the cells [

 <italic>Origanum</italic> genus essential oils is widely described in literature [

 <xref rid="B77-molecules-26-00988" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. However, the comparison of the activity among different subspecies of the genus is rater scarce. Results obtained in the present study indicate on stronger antimicrobial activity of Greek oregano essential oil than common oregano. This may be explained by higher content of carvacrol (37.21%) followed by 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (10.45%) in this essential oil (
