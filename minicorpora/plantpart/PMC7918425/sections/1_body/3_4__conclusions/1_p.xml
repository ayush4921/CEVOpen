<p>Greek oregano and common oregano differed in terms of chemical composition and biological activity of essential oils and hydroethanolic extracts. Due to the observed antioxidant potential, it seems that essential oils and extracts of both subspecies may be regarded as a promising source of natural antioxidants. However, considering the antibacterial properties, only Greek oregano should be taken into consideration, since such activity of common oregano essential oil and extracts was rather low. Obtained results are probably associated with various proportions of volatiles (i.a. carvacrol, thymol as well as other monoterpenes) and non-volatiles (i.e., rosmarinic and lithosperimic acid B) that may be responsible for limiting bacteria growth and inactivation of free radicals. To conclude, in the case of the 
 <italic>Origanum</italic> plants, the potential application of its essential oils and extracts as antiseptic and/or antioxidant agents in the food industry, should be preceded by subspecies identification followed by recognition of their chemotype concerning both terpene and phenolics composition.
