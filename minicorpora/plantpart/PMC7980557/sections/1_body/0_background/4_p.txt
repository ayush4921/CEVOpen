0: Cannabis sativa is a wonder plant with over 500 chemical entities (Radwan et al.
1: 2009) including over 100 phytocannabinoids and 120 terpenes (Calvi et al.
2: 2018), of which less than 30 biosyntheses have been characterized (Booth and Bohlmann  2019).
3: Phytocannabinoids are divided into 10 subclasses, i.e., cannabigerol, cannabichromene, cannabidiol, ()- trans- 9-tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabicyclol, cannabielsoin, cannabinol, cannabitriol, and miscellaneous (Brenneisen  2007).
4: There has been also a new phytocannabinoid identified which is called 9-tetrahydrocannabiphorol (9-THCP) (Citti et al.
5: 2019).
6: Recently, the molecular pharmacology of the seven most phytocannabinoids (namely 9-tetrahydrocannabinol, 9-tetrahydrocannabivarin, cannabinol, cannabidiol, cannabidivarin, cannabigerol, and cannabichromene) was investigated thoroughly (Turner et al.
7: 2017), and 14 cannabinoids, 47 terpenoids, 3 sterols, and 7 flavonoids have been profiled in Cannabis flowers, leaves, stem barks, and roots for medicinal purposes (Jin et al.
8: 2020).
9: Moreover, the medicinal effects of  Cannabis sativa are exploited within the treatment of epilepsy, pain, anxiety, depression, sleep disorders, nausea related to cancer treatment, and psychotic conditions, and it has antiglaucoma, antiemetic, antiobesity, and anticancer properties (Andre et al.
10: 2016, Barrales-Cureno et al.
11: 2020, Corroon and Phillips  2018).
12: In addition, the government of Canada recognizes  Cannabis sativa as an effective treatment for over two dozen conditions (Health Canada  2018).
13: It is noteworthy that the scientific interest in  Cannabis sativa was renewed in the early 1990s with the outline of cannabinoid receptors and therefore the identification of an endogenous cannabinoid system in the nervous system of humans (Zuardi  2006) wherein the pharmacological mechanisms of Cannabis metabolites would guide advances in therapies and changes in public health approaches (Russo and Marcu  2017).
