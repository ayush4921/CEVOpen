3: Folk medicine practitioners (FMPs) in Bangladesh are commonly known as  Kabiraj in the mainstream community and there are  kabirajes in almost every village in Bangladesh.

5: They enjoy considerable trust and support from their patients thanks to their holistic approach to treatment (Biswas et al.
6: 2011).

15: 2011).
