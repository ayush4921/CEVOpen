 <caption> DPPH free radical scavenging activity of MEHA compared with the reference standard ascorbic acid (AA). ( A) Percentage of DPPH free radical scavenging activity by different concentrations of the MEHA and reference standard AA. ( B) IC 50 values for DPPH free radical scavenging activity of MEHA and AA. Values are expressed as mean Â± SEM of three independent experiments. MEHA refers to methanol extract of Homalomena aromatica leaves. DPPH: 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical. </caption>
