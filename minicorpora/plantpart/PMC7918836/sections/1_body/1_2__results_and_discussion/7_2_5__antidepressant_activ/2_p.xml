<p>A recent investigation suggest that stressful conditions activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis which in turn stimulates the periventricular neurons to release corticotrophin-releasing factors [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-26-00975" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. As it is well known depression symptoms are revealed due to overactivation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, causing abnormal regulation of corticotrophin-releasing factors resulting in the suppression of the adrenocorticotropic hormone response and elevated cerebrospinal fluid levels [

Moreover, several neurotransmitters including serotonin, noradrenalin, dopamine, and GABA are involved in the pathophysiology of depressive illness. Thus, it is also believed that depression is due to the deficiency of one or another of these neurotransmitters [

In forced swim experiments, when mice are forced to swim in a confined condition, they become immobile after an initial period of struggling. This inevitable stressful condition is evaluated as the parameter to measure the activity of antidepressant agents. In this test (

Animals treated with imipramine hydrochloride (10 mg/kg), as expected, showed a significant decrease in their immobility time (66.67 ± 0.89 s). Similarly, the tail suspension assay is another primary screening test for detecting antidepressant activity of a substance. This test induces a state of despair in animals similar to that of forced swim test. In the tail suspension test (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00975-f005">Figure 5</xref>B), animals were treated with 200 and 400 mg/kg doses of MEHA showed decreases in their immobility times (177.00 ± 2.16 s and 87.33 ± 1.96 s, respectively) which was significant as compared to control (202.33 ± 2.896 s), while animals treated with imipramine hydrochloride (10 mg/kg), also showed a significant decrease in their immobility time (82.33 ± 1.29 s). This evidence suggest that MEHA has the ability to suppress depression and anxiety in mice.
