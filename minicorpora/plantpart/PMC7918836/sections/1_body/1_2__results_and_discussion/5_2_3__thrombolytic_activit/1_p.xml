<p>Formation of blood clots is one of the chief causes of blood circulation problems. Thrombi or emboli can be deposited in the blood vessels and can obstruct blood flow in that location depriving tissues from normal blood flow and oxygen. Ultimately, this can result in damage, destruction or even death of the tissues in that area. Thrombolysis is the process by which blood clots can be destroyed by administering thrombolytic drugs including recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, which reinforce the normal destruction of blood clots by the bodyâ€™s enzymes, however, this may cause an increased risk of bleeding so it is usually used only for specific situations (such as massive pulmonary embolism and severe strokes). Plants are natural sources of many remedies including ones for the treatment of thrombosis. There are many research works that have reported the discovery of plants with thrombolytic activity and the use of such plants as a source of medicines that may lead to the prevention and treatment of strokes and coronary disease [
