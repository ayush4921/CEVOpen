<p>Historically plants are the major source of invaluable therapeutic agents for the treatment of different diseases [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-26-00975" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Natural products generate a wide range of interest to discover new drugs, even in this modern age, because plants are magnificent sources of biomolecules providing new pathways to treat many chronic ailments [

Nowadays, available drugs on the market for the treatment of thrombosis include antiplatelet agents (aspirin, thienopyridine) and anticoagulants (heparin, warfarin, hirudin, human activated protein C) that act by preventing blood clotting. There are also a number of clinically available antidepressant and anxiolytic drugs, apparently acting via different mechanisms, including dopaminergic, noradrenergic or serotonergic pathways. However, these drugs have limitations including insufficient efficacy over a longer period of time and unexpected side effects [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-26-00975" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Therefore, in recent years many researchers have explored alternative source of drugs that seemingly show less or no side effects. Many natural herbal plants, for example,
