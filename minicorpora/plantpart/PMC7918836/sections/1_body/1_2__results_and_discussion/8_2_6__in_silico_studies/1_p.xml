<p>Contacts between ligand and protein are fundamental to all organic processes. By means of these interactions, living entities maintain all types of regulatory and metabolic systems that together organize their lifecycle processes. To predict and understand all off these biological processes, computer-aided analyses: molecular docking, homological modeling, molecular dynamics and simulations are widely used scientific tools because these methods are economic and time saving. The target molecules can be also utilized as bioactive substances for modification and controlling the bio-mechanism in an in silico medium. To make our findings more relevant, we conducted an in silico molecular docking investigation targeting xanthine oxidoreductase (PDB: 2CKJ) to determine antioxidant properties, tissue plasminogen activator receptor (PDB: 1A5H) for thrombolytic activity, potassium channel receptor (PDB: 4UUJ) for anxiolytic properties, and human serotonin receptor (PDB: 5I6X) for antidepressant activity. In this analysis, four widely used standard agents—ascorbic acid, streptokinase, diazepam and imipramine hydrochloride—were selected to compare the docking scores with the compounds obtained from essential oils from the leaves of
