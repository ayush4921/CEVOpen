<p>According to their uppermost docking score against xanthine oxidoreductase, human serotonin receptor, potassium channel receptor, tissue plasminogen activator receptor, we have selected 13 phytocompounds in order to find their probable pharmacokinetic factors from drug likeness point of views with their toxicological properties. These sort of categorizations are considered to be a vital phase in the drug development process because it saves time in clinical trials besides expenditures of money. In the current study, SwissADME, an online tool was, used to estimate the pharmacokinetic properties of the 13 selected compounds based on Lipinski’s rule of five and Veber’s rules (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00975-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). Oral bioavailability is the vital feature for the development of novel candidate. As described by Lipinski’s rules, an orally introduced drug should have a MW &lt;500 amu, HBA sites &lt;10, HBD sites &lt;5, and, Log P ≤5, whereas Veber et al. recommend that a drug candidate should have the nRB value ≤10 and TPSA value ≤140 Å
 <sup>2</sup> [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-26-00975" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. If any compounds violate one of these rules, it cannot be considered a perfect therapeutic agent. Surprisingly, none of the compounds violated these rules in this study. This indicates that all of the compounds have good oral bioavailability and could be considered as possible candidates for the next drug development.
