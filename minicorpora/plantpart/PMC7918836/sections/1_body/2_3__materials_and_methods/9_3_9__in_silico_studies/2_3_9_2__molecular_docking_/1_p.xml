<p>The receptors proteins were received from the database of Protein Data Bank (PDB) (
 <uri xlink:href="https://www.rcsb.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.rcsb.org/</uri> (accessed on 1 November 2020)). The structures (3D) were taken in PDB format. Pre-processing and minimization step were completed through Protein-Preparation wizard also included in the Schr√∂dinger Maestro v 11.1 suite [
 <xref rid="B55-molecules-26-00975" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The factors that were kept in consideration during this work: the structures optimization pH: 7 and protein minimization done by using OPLS3 force-field. Lastly, the receptor grid selected by using PockDrug which is an online tool for picking the finest binding site.
