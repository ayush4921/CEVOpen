<p>The total phenolics content of MEHA was determined using Folin-Ciocalteu reagent following the method described by Singleton et al. [
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-26-00975" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Briefly, MEHA (200 μL) was mixed with 400 μL of Folin-Ciocalteu reagent and 1.5 mL of 20% sodium carbonate. The mixture was shaken thoroughly followed by addition of distilled water to make a volume up to 10 mL, and then allowed to stand for 2 h. The absorbance was measured at 765 nm by UV-Spectrophotometer. The concentration of total phenolics content in the extract (10–200 μg/mL) was determined using gallic acid standard curve and results were expressed as mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE) per g of extract (mg GAE/g). The test was analyzed and results were articulated as mean ± SEM.
