<p>The study with nutmeg seed products as a preservative is the beginning of many studies of the future where natural materials (plants, herbs, seeds) can be used as natural preservatives in solid medicines forms (such as gel tablets which have water in their composition).

Another benefit of natural materials from plants is that extracts and essential oils have a pharmacological effect and can be used as synergistic materials together with pharmaceutical substances.</p>
