<p>Evaluating the results of the chewable gel tablets’ textures, which were achieved with different preservatives, it can be concluded that the tablets’ firmness increase nearly 4 times and springiness decreased by about 1.65 times when kept in such storage conditions as an opened plastic box at room temperature. In the study by Bartkienė et al. (2018), gummy candies’ hardness, gumminess, and chewiness were measured. When thyme or cloves essential oil (0.2%) were added to the gummies, the hardness decreased from about 5400 to 2900 g (thyme) and to 3400 g (cloves), the gumminess decreased by about 1.3 times and the chewiness increased by about 1.14 and 1.08 times [

(2019) where gummy bears with vitamin D3 and calcium carbonate were prepared, the texture variation was determined. Statistically significant results of decreasing firmness, strength, and hardness were obtained when active substances were added. The firmness decreased over 50%, hardness—about 30%, strength—about 40% [
