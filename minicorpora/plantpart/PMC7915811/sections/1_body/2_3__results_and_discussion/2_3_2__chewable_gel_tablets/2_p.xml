<p>All samples’ tablets (

Certain storage conditions (temperature 20 ± 5 °C and an opened box) caused the tablets to lose from 44.08% to 50.95% of their weight—the water in the tablets evaporated and the texture changed. In this study, it was observed that the tablets containing glycerol (all except G0) increased in weight after two weeks (this was due to the increased humidity in the room due to changed weather conditions). Glycerol attracted moisture from the environment to the tablets. Based on the study by Ramos et al. (2013), the moisture in the films varies depending on the glycerol concentration (from 17.91% to 21.71%, glycerol concentrations 40–60%) [
