 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-13-00238-f002">Figure 2</xref>B) lost from 15.01% to 21.94% of their mass after 28 days. The highest amount of water and other liquid material was lost from Eo, Eos, Ee, and E samples. All samples had essential oil or ethanol extract which can evaporate together with water therefore they have more changes in mass. The lowest mass variation was determined in G0 and Sb, 14.67% and 15.01%, respectively. The tablets without glycerol from a freezer had the lowest mass variation. It can be concluded that freezing and thawing have the lowest effect on these gel tablets because only water evaporates and glycerol does not attract moisture from the environment since the temperature is too low (water is frozen) and the thawing time is too short for all of the formulations. Glycerol amount in these chewable gel tablets was 9.6%. Based on the literature, 10% glycerol solution’s freezing temperature (a point when the solution freezes) is −1.6 °C [
