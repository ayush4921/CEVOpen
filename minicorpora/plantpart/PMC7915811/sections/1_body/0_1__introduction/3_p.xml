<p>Gel tablets are prepared by using excipients which have gelling properties (gelatin, pectin, tragacanth, starch, agar, and many others). Most gelling agents are polysaccharides and polymers which form gels [

Gelatin is widely used not only in the food industry but also in the pharmaceutical industry for the making of gelatin capsules and gelatin-based plasma substitutes. Additionally, it is used as an emulsifier, a microencapsulating agent or a stabilizer in some vaccines, and as a gelling agent [

There are several methods to prepare a gelatin-based solution but the most popular is to pour cold water on gelatin and leave it for several minutes to swell and then heat it to dissolve the gelatin. Gelatin forms colloidal solutions with water and gels of varying stiffness are produced depending on the concentration [
