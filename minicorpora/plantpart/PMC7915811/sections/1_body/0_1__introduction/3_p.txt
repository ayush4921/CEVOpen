0: Gel tablets are prepared by using excipients which have gelling properties (gelatin, pectin, tragacanth, starch, agar, and many others).
1: Most gelling agents are polysaccharides and polymers which form gels [ 2, 8, 9].
2: Gelatin is a natural material made from pork skin, beef hide or bones, and its extraction and consumption are growing every year (from 130 tons in 1974 to 305 tons in 2005) [ 10].
3: Gelatin made from fish is an alternative to pescatarians though its cost is 45-times higher than porcine or bovine gelatin [ 11].
4: All gelatin types have many amino acids, approximately 90% protein, which is a good food supplement [ 10, 11].
5: Gelatin is widely used not only in the food industry but also in the pharmaceutical industry for the making of gelatin capsules and gelatin-based plasma substitutes.
6: Additionally, it is used as an emulsifier, a microencapsulating agent or a stabilizer in some vaccines, and as a gelling agent [ 10, 12, 13].
7: To prepare a biopolymer (gelatin) solution, the use of water is required but it is a good media for microorganisms.
8: There are several methods to prepare a gelatin-based solution but the most popular is to pour cold water on gelatin and leave it for several minutes to swell and then heat it to dissolve the gelatin.
9: Gelatin forms colloidal solutions with water and gels of varying stiffness are produced depending on the concentration [ 4, 5, 10, 12, 14].
