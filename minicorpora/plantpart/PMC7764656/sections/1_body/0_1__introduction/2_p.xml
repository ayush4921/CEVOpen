<p>One of the most controversial areas of nutrition research is that of fats (particularly essential fatty acids), namely as related to cardiovascular disease risk. There are some major hurdles to overcome when studying the effects of fatty acids on the cardiovascular system and, particularly, on atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD). One is that a large part of the available data should be interpreted under the overarching concept of “replacement” rather than direct effect [

Another, and the probably more relevant, issue is that fatty acids are part of more complex food matrices, and, therefore, it is very difficult to single out the contribution of individual classes of these compounds to human health. In other words, the same fatty acid ingested as part of a plant-based diet versus an animal-based often appears to exert different effects [

 <xref rid="B6-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], even it is difficult to explain such differences considering their obvious chemical identity.
