<p>Omega 6 PUFAs became very popular in the late 70s when Dr. Ancel Keys and coworkers undertook the Seven Countries study [

 <xref rid="B151-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>] advocated the use of seed oils rather than butter. Then, the theory that predicts that the essential omega 6 fatty acids, namely linoleic acid, increase inflammation because they are precursors of eicosanoids led some investigators to classify them as harmful. As reviewed above, this theory proved unsound in humans, and consumption data actually indicate that linoleic acid use is often below recommended levels. Hence, there is—at present—no sound evidence to suggest that they should be looked upon as harmful, and there is no reason to worry about the proportion of calories they provide within a healthy diet.
