<p>Concerning omega 3 fatty acids and cardiovascular disease, the state-of-the-art is as follows: enhanced intakes of omega 3 fatty acids are cardioprotective via modulation of various parameters. The effects are obtained with relatively low amounts of omega 3, in the order of ~500 mgâ€“1 g/day, which is a tiny fraction of total fat ingested daily (around 100 g in most countries [

One interesting trait of omega 3 fatty acids is, indeed, that their accrual in plasma and cell lipids is relevant, even at such relatively low levels of intake. Further, EPA and DHA mainly accumulate in rather stable lipid pools where they are retained even after long washout periods [

The current impasse of fish oil use in cardiovascular secondary prevention requires a redirection of our approach to the pharmacology of these molecules, which should chiefly implicate reflections on doses and formulations. The advice to consume omega 3-rich oily fish, nuts, and leafy vegetables rests on solid evidence. Current research on transgenic plants that provide EPA and DHA [
