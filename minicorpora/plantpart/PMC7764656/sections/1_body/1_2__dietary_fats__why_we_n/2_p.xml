<p>In addition to providing the most quantitatively dense amount of energy, fatty acids play very relevant physiological roles [

 <xref rid="B14-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Notably, selected types of fatty acids, such as the long-chain, highly unsaturated fatty acids of the omega 6 and omega 3 series, are important modulators of cell function and precursors of lipid mediators. In other words, dietary fat is indispensable for energy, delivery of lipid-soluble vitamins, and physiology. Even though the lay public (and physicians as well) often think that diets should be as low in fat as possible, the results of the largest ever randomized intervention trial, i.e., the Women Health Initiative (WHI) [
 <xref rid="B15-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], have shown that limiting the intake of total fat does not significantly improve the cardiovascular risk profile, the incidence of type 2 diabetes and, probably, does not induce remarkable weight loss. Indeed, no significant protective effect of low-fat diets on cardiovascular end-points was observed in this trial, which comprised women who reduced their total fat intake from 35/37% to 25/27% for an average of 7 years, as compared to women who did not change their diet [

 <xref rid="B18-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], persons consuming about 50% of calories from fat had a large, i.e., almost 50%, reduction of the risk of all-cause mortality as compared to persons who derive about 30% of calories from fat, as most of the international guidelines suggest [
