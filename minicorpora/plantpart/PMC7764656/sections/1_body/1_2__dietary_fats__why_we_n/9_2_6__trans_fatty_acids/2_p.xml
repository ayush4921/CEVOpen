<p>Recent analyses of erythrocytes from European subjects indicate that levels of industrial 
 <italic>trans</italic> fatty acids appear to be decreasing, as are those of ruminant-derived C16:1n-7t, a marker for dairy and meat intake [
 <xref rid="B140-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>]. Altogether, the average intakes in European countries of ~1 energy percent [
 <xref rid="B141-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>] and less than that in the United Kingdom, with a major proportion coming from dairy products and meat [
 <xref rid="B142-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>]. In France, for example, 
 <italic>trans</italic> fatty acidsâ€™ intake is now exclusively from ruminant meat and dairy products [
 <xref rid="B143-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>]. The USA is also witnessing a slow reduction in industrial 
 <italic>trans</italic> fatty acids use. In Europe and the USA, the average intake of 
 <italic>trans</italic> fatty acids from ruminant sources is around 0.5 energy percent [
