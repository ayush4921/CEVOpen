<p>One matter worth discussing is the conventional classification of 
 <italic>trans</italic> fatty acids in two groups: artificial 
 <italic>trans</italic> fatty acids (of industrial origin) and natural 
 <italic>trans</italic> fatty acids (produced by ruminants) [
 <xref rid="B138-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>]. This leads to a discussion of whether the latter have cardiovascular actions different than the former. Indeed, milk fat naturally contains ~5% 
 <italic>trans</italic> fatty acids, resulting in very low intakes. Few observational studies have investigated separate effects of dietary ruminant 
 <italic>trans</italic> fatty acids, which ranges from 2.8–10 g/day [
 <xref rid="B144-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>]. No adverse effects of ruminant 
 <italic>trans</italic> fatty acid intake were noted [
 <xref rid="B144-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>], in line with previous conclusions [
 <xref rid="B23-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. On the contrary, some authors propose putative effects of ruminant 
 <italic>trans</italic> fatty acids [
 <xref rid="B145-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>,
 <xref rid="B146-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>,
 <xref rid="B147-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>]. Of course, those fatty acids are part of more complex food items, and it is difficult or even impossible to single out their true contribution to human health and pathology.
