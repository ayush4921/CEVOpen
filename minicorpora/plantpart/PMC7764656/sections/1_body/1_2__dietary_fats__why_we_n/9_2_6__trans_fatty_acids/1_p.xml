 <italic>Trans</italic> fatty acids are unsaturated fatty acids with at least one double bond in the 
 <italic>trans</italic> configuration, which results in a straighter molecular shape than with a double bond in a 
 <italic>cis</italic> configuration. 
 <italic>Trans</italic> fatty acids are not essential, and they do not serve any vital functions [
 <xref rid="B138-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>]. Conversely, the consumption of 
 <italic>trans</italic> fatty acids (usually identified on food labels as “partially hydrogenated vegetable fats”) has untoward effects on lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, i.e., increase in LDL cholesterol, reduction of HDL cholesterol, and deterioration of endothelial function, perhaps due to their pro-inflammatory actions. There is a clear direct association between consumption of 
 <italic>trans</italic> fatty acids with food and coronary risk [

 <italic>trans</italic> fatty acids has been banned are witnessing a decrease in cardiovascular events [
