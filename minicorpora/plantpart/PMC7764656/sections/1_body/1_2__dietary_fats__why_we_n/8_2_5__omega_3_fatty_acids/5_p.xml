<p>Even though the VITAL trial performed by Manson et al. recently concluded that “supplementation with n-3 fatty acids did not result in a lower incidence of major cardiovascular events or cancer than placebo” in 25,871 participants who underwent randomization in a two-by-two factorial design trial of vitamin D
 <sub>3</sub> (at a dose of 2000 IU per day) and marine n-3 fatty acids (at a dose of 1 g per day) in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, a close inspection of the tables shows that the hazard ratios for total myocardial infarction were 0.72 (95% CI, 0.59 to 0.90), those for death from myocardial infarction were 0.50 (0.26–0.57), and those for percutaneous coronary intervention were 0.78 (0.73–0.95), i.e., statistically significant [
