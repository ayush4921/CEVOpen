<p>On the other hand, the recent STRENGTH (Statin Residual Risk Reduction with Epanova in High CV Risk Patients with Hypertriglyceridemia) trial, evaluating the effect of Epanova
 <sup>Â®</sup> 4 g daily compared to placebo (corn oil) on reducing the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in 13,086 patients on optimal statin therapy with mixed dyslipidemia and at high risk for CV disease, was stopped early due to its low likelihood of demonstrating a benefit [

Finally, an RCT of krill oil, i.e., omega 3 mostly as phospholipids, carried out in 242 patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia, was also stopped after 12 of the programmed 46 weeks because of a strong placebo effect and the very recent Bischoff et al. publication reported no significant differences in improvement in systolic and diastolic blood pressure of older adults given 1 g/d of algal oil (330 mg of EPA and 660 mg DHA) [
