<p>Interest in ALA gained momentum at an International workshop, whose conclusions were published in the year 2000 by Crawford et al. [

 <xref rid="B130-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>], ALA has been often neglected as bioactive omega 3 fatty acid. The only secondary prevention trial in which ALA has been employed (as an ingredient of margarine) was the Lyon Heart Study [
 <xref rid="B131-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>], which was interrupted early because of statistically significant results, had a small number of events, and has never been replicated. Its follow-up, however, confirmed the positive effects of ALA on reinfarction rates [

 <xref rid="B133-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>], suggesting its use in visceral obesity prevention. Other evidence indicative of the cardioprotective effects of ALA come from epidemiological data linking high consumption of ALA-rich foods, such as walnuts [

 <xref rid="B136-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>], and some seed oils [
 <xref rid="B137-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>]. Currently, large-scale primary or secondary prevention trials are missing, and, in summary, the cardiovascular actions of ALA have been poorly explored and remain to be fully elucidated [
