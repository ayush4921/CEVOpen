<p>Very recently, Lazáro et al. [
 <xref rid="B92-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>] investigated whether serum-PC EPA (proxy for marine omega 3 consumption) levels at the time of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) were associated with a lower incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events, all-cause mortality, and readmission for cardiovascular (CV) causes at 3 years’ follow-up. Elevated serum-PC EPA and ALA levels at the time of STEMI were associated with a lower risk of clinical adverse events, which the authors attribute to diets rich in those two fatty acids [

 <xref rid="B93-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>] reported that icosapent ethyl 4 g/day significantly and safely reduced triacyclglycerols (TG) and other atherogenic and inflammatory parameters without increasing LDL-C in statin-treated patients with hsCRP ≥ 2.0 mg/L and TG 200 to 499 mg/dL at baseline, versus placebo [
