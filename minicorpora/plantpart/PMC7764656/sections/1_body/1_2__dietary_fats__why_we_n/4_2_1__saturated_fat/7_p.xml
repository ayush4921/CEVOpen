<p>In summary, the uncritical advice to reduce intake of SFAs without considering specific fatty acids and food sources is not aligned with the current evidence base [
 <xref rid="B36-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The view that saturated fat (a highly heterogeneous class of fatty acids) per se increases cardiovascular mortality is over-simplistic and distracts from the “food matrix” concept. Various saturated fatty acids have distinct metabolic roles [
