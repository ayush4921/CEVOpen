<p>Another meaningful source of saturated fat is meat, namely that of ruminant origin. Because of this, its consumption is often associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk [
 <xref rid="B36-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This chiefly applies to processed meat [
 <xref rid="B37-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], and the consumption levels of 0.5 servings per day or less are not associated with increased cardiovascular risk [
 <xref rid="B38-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. For unexplored reasons, these associations are much less pronounced in European studies [
 <xref rid="B39-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The increasing evidence that compounds other than saturated fatty acids (namely, carnitine and choline), which can be converted in TMAO by microbiota and liver FMO enzymes, may be responsible for the atherogenic effects of meat [
 <xref rid="B40-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] also indirectly supports the idea that the role of saturated fatty acids, in this context, may actually be quite limited.
