<p>As discussed below, milk and derivatives are rich in saturated fatty acids (they account for about 41% of the total saturated fatty acids intake in the Holland EPIC cohort) [
 <xref rid="B25-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and contain ruminant 
 <italic>trans</italic> fatty acids, whose consumption, in light of the data available to date, should not be discouraged [
 <xref rid="B21-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Indeed, in addition to saturated fatty acids, milk also contains calcium and/or tripeptides with a mild ACE-inhibitory action, which might, in fact, induce a reduction of blood pressure [
 <xref rid="B27-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and, therefore, of the risk of cerebrovascular events, with varied effects on the risk of coronary events [
 <xref rid="B26-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Further, milk consumption is being associated with lower coronary artery calcification progression [
 <xref rid="B29-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], possibly because of its specific short-chain saturated fatty acids pattern [
 <xref rid="B25-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In summary, milk is a complex food item [
 <xref rid="B30-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and those who eliminate it and its derivatives from their diet (generally due to real or presumed intolerance) might statistically experience a significant increase in the risk of developing diabetes or hypertension (one new case for every 15 subjects who stop using milk) [
 <xref rid="B31-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Cheese intake, in a number of observational studies, is associated with a reduction of CVD events and stroke [
 <xref rid="B26-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. It is also of interest that the circulating or adipose tissue concentrations of the odd-chain fatty acids 15:0 and 17:0, which can be considered as a specific marker of intake of milk and dairy products (these fatty acids are not contained in significant amounts in other foods and cannot be synthesized by humans), are often associated, in observational studies, with a decrease of CVD events [
 <xref rid="B32-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="B33-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].
