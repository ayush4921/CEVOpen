<p>The main PUFA in the diet is linoleic acid (18:2ω6, LA), followed by alpha-linolenic acid (18:3ω3, ALA). Their intakes among adults in the Western world are approximately 13.5 g and 1.7 g per day, respectively. Longer-chain PUFAs are consumed in lower amounts than LA and ALA. Arachidonic acid (20:4ω6, ARA) intake in Western populations fluctuates between 50 and 300 mg/day. It is important to underscore that, although several fatty acids can be synthesized in the human body, mammals are able to insert double bonds in fatty acids’ position 9 but are unable to do so in positions 3 and 6, which is indispensable to synthesize PUFAs [

Conversely, longer chain ω6 and ω3 can be obtained, even if with different efficiency, from the aforementioned 18 carbon PUFAs, through the intervention of specific desaturases (∆5 and ∆6) and elongases.
