<p>Among the three macronutrients, i.e., carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, the latter, mainly composed of fatty acids part of triacylglycerols and, to a lesser extent, phospholipids, are relevant determinants of the health status [

In many developing countries, fat intake is increasing, while in developed countries, fat intake has tended to decline over the past 30 years or so. Fats are quantitatively relevant in the diet because of at least two reasons: (1) easy availability due to massive cultivation of plants for oil production and (2) current low cost of energy-rich, fatty foods. We also need to eat fat for (a) energy provision; (b) essential fatty acid intake; (c) liposoluble vitaminsâ€™ intake; (d) augment food palatability (most flavors are liposoluble) [

In addition to the total amount of fat, it is important to note that the type of fat has also changed over time; the result is that the fatty acid composition of the human diet has changed. Data available from the UK indicate that the ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acids in the diet increased from 0.17 in 1959 to 0.22 in 1979 and to 0.40 in 1990 [
 <xref rid="B11-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Much of this change has been brought about by a change in consumption habits, facilitated by public health bodies and scientific societies. Consumers moved from butter and animal fats to vegetable oils. In Europe, total fat intake ranges from 28.5 to 46.2% of total energy [
 <xref rid="B12-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], of which polyunsaturated fatty acids represent 2.8 to 11.3%E [
