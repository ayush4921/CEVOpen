<p>Several case-control studies that analyzed fatty acids profiles in the circulation actually reported higher rather than lower CHD risk as associated with higher proportions of MUFAs. Examples include Block et al. [

 <xref rid="B55-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], who compared 119 patients with a recent diagnosis of myocardial infarction with 103 controls. Whole blood oleic acid concentrations were higher in the former than in the latter. Finally, a metabolomic study by WÃ¼rtz et al. [
 <xref rid="B56-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] classified circulating monounsaturated fatty acids as predictors of cardiovascular risk in 14,629 participants to three population-based studies carried out in Finland and the UK. Of note, recent research indicates that the effects of plant-derived monounsaturates are different than those found in meat [
