<p>While the near totality of dietary MUFAs is oleic acid, it is worth devoting a brief discussion to the role of palmitoleic acid (16:1Ï‰ 7): its dietary intake is quite low (main sources are macadamia and sea buckthorn oils, neither of which is consumed in quantities worth noting worldwide), and this fatty acid is considered as a marker of lipogenesis, particularly important in cardiometabolism, namely in the etiology of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Among the proposed activities of omega 3 fatty acids (see below), their inhibition of hepatic lipogenesis via inhibition of the LXR-SREBP-1c system [
