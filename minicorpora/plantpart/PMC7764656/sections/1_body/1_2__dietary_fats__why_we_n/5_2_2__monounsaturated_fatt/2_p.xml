<p>Mostly based on the indisputable association between olive oil use and lower CHD incidence (as well as that of neurodegeneration and cancer [
 <xref rid="B46-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]), many researchers and public health bodies attribute MUFAs direct healthful properties. However, a close look at the published literature casts some doubt on this assumption, and the effects of extra virgin olive oil in relation to coronary risk are to be attributed to its (poly)phenols and not to its lipid components such as oleic acid [
