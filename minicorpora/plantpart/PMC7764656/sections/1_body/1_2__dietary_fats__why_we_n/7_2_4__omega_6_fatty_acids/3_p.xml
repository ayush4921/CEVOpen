<p>Theoretically, omega 6 fatty acids, namely arachidonic acid, could be pro-inflammatory, being the precursors of eicosanoids. From a nutritional viewpoint, some theories posit the competitive relationship with omega 3 fatty acids, with which omega 6 should compete for some enzymatic activities, i.e., elongation and desaturation [

 <xref rid="B69-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], and a systematic review of the literature did not actually conclude on any increase in inflammatory markers associated with the consumption of omega 6 in humans [

 <xref rid="B77-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>] omega 6/omega 3 ratio did not correlate significantly with the risk itself [
 <xref rid="B55-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Additionally, the omega 6/omega 3 ratio was negatively associated with the overall death rate, i.e., increasing ratios were associated with decreasing the risk of death for any cause in a recent and very large prospective cohort [
