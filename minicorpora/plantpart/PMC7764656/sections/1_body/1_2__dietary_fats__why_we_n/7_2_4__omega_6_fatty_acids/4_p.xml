<p>Even though it is difficult to study the direct effects of ARA in humans, via RCTs, a review of dietary surveys of ARA intake indicates that the amount of ARA intake is 100–250 mg/day in advanced counties. ARA supplementation (82 or 120 mg/day for 3–4 weeks) at a dose equal to or less than the dietary ARA intake increases plasma ARA composition; plasma ARA composition is ARA dose-dependently increased in the range of 82–3600 mg/day; and ARA supplementation decreases plasma LA composition but not docosahexaenoic/eicosapentaenoic acids composition [
