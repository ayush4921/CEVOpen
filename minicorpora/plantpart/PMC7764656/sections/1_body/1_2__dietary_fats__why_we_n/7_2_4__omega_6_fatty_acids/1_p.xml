<p>As mentioned, the most abundant omega 6 PUFA in the diet is LA (18:2ω6), whose intakes are, on average, 50-fold higher than those of ARA [

 <xref rid="B66-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,
 <xref rid="B67-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Research on LA gained traction approximately 50 years ago [
 <xref rid="B68-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] when this fatty acid was shown to decrease blood cholesterol concentrations. Consequently, dietary advice to increase its consumption was issued by public health authorities. Indeed, polyunsaturated fat (again, primarily LA) in the US increased from approximately 3% of energy in the 1950s to about 6–7% of energy [

 <xref rid="B70-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. The increase in LA consumption was associated with a marked (50%) reduction of cardiovascular disease in the US [
 <xref rid="B69-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. This profound dietary change was confirmed by large increases in the LA acid content of adipose samples. The effects of omega 6 PUFAs (and of other fatty acids) on blood lipids have been calculated by equations that yielded almost identical results: consumption of saturated fat is positively related, and polyunsaturated fat is inversely related to serum cholesterol concentrations [
 <xref rid="B47-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,
 <xref rid="B49-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. These findings were corroborated by Mensink et al. [
 <xref rid="B50-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], who also addressed the effects of dietary fats on not only total blood cholesterol but also LDL and HDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels [
 <xref rid="B50-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In summary, compared to carbohydrates, polyunsaturated fat (the vast majority of which is, as mentioned above, omega 6 PUFA) reduces LDL cholesterol, with little effect on HDL cholesterol and triglycerides. Hence, dietary intake of omega 6 fatty acids, e.g., the substitution of 5% of calories from saturates with linoleic acid, was associated with a significant reduction in cardiovascular risk (−9%) in a US meta-analysis [
 <xref rid="B71-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. The association between increasing LA intake and reduction in CHD events holds, in this meta-analysis, up to at least 8% of total calories from LA. Two recent meta-analyses have shown a negative association of LA plasma or tissue levels (which reflect the intake of this essential fatty acid) with CHD and CVD incidence and mortality [
 <xref rid="B72-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] and type 2 diabetes incidence [
 <xref rid="B73-nutrients-12-03782" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>].
