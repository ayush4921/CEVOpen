The rotatable bonds (not more than 3) were in line with the rule of three, and their acute oral toxicity values were well below 5 mg/kg. Caryophyllene oxide is soluble in water, while α-bergamotene and β-bisabolene are moderately soluble. The human intestinal adsorption and blood–brain barrier of the compounds were very high, and the compounds were not carcinogenic. These results are indications that α-bergamotene, β-bisabolene, and caryophyllene oxide are excellent drug candidates (Zhong
