Lipinski's rule of five, which is determined by a complex balance of various molecular properties and structural features such as lipophilicity, electronic distribution, hydrogen bonding characteristics, molecule size, and flexibility, as well as the presence of various pharmacophores that influence the behavior of a molecule in a living organism, were used to predict the drug likeliness of the compounds. A good drug candidate should not violate more than one of the rules (Lipinski
