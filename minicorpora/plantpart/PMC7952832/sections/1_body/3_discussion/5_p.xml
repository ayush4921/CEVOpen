<p id="Par57">The hydrogen bond, pi-sigma, pi-alkyl, and alkyl type interactions were the main forces that held the compounds in the protein pockets. At least two hydrogen bonds were observed in all the protein–Remdesivir interactions, and one was found only in the RDRP-caryophyllene oxide interaction. The protein–Remdesivir interactions in all the protein pockets had at least two hydrogen bonds and the other interacting forces, in the pockets of the studied proteins. Caryophyllene oxide and Remdesivir interacted with ASN 209 by hydrogen bonding in RDRP, while α-bergamotene and Remdesivir interacted by alkyl forces with ILE 120, ALA 150, and ALA 102. These suggested that the mechanism of inhibition of the proteins at these sites by caryophyllene oxide and α-bergamotene was similar to the action of Remdesivir at those sites.</p>
