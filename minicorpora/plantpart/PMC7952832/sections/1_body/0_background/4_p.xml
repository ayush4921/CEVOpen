<p id="Par38">Recently, the governor of Oyo State in Nigeria revealed that the oil from 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seed was one of the remedies he consumed to combat the disease, a week after he tested positive for COVID-19 (Punch Newspaper, April 7, 2020). So far, no attempt has been made to investigate the veracity of this claim. In this study, the oil from the seed of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> was extracted, and the identified phytochemical components docked on some selected SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The dock scores of these compounds were compared to the values obtained with a standard COVID-19 prescription drug.
