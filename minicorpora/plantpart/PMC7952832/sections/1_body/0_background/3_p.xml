<p id="Par37">The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) began in Wuhan, China, and was reported to the World Health Organization on December 31, 2019 (WHO 2020). The pandemic ravaged the entire globe, claiming hundreds of thousands of lives. Community to community transmission is now evident in many countries, with a daily rise in the number of cases. There are potential drug targets essential for the survival of the coronavirus, which include a 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2), ADP ribose phosphatase of Nonstructured Protein 3 (NSP3), Nonstructured Protein 9 RNA binding protein (NSP9), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and Replicase Polyprotein 1a (RP1a). To infect the host, the structural spike glycoprotein interacts with the transmembrane protein of the human host cell receptor ACE2 (Guy et al.

The main protease 3CLpro acts in the viral polyprotein large Replicase Polyprotein 1a (RP1a) proteolytic cleavage, cleaving it into functional units to produce nonstructural viral constituents like RdRp, NSP3, and NSP9. This makes 3CLpro and ACE2 important drug targets to inhibit Nonstructured Proteins production and terminate viral action. The RP1a and the NSPs (RdRp, NSP3, and NSP9) are important targets involved in the replication and translation process, which lead to a viral proliferation in host cells (Kumar et al.

Although no drug is currently available to cure this disease, Remdesivir, an antiviral drug has been clinically tested and confirmed useable in the interim (Williamson et al.
