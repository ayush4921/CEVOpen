 <italic>N. sativa</italic> oil and seed have a long history in many cultures. Islamic medicine also cataloged the numerous benefits of this plant (Sharma et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2009</xref>). Its compounds have been shown to have various pharmacological effects on different body parts. Empirical studies have reported that the seed oil and seed extracts have antimicrobial activities, which some workers have attributed to the presence of compounds such as thymohydroquinone and melanin (Kalim 2013; Al Yahya 1986). The seed extract contains numerous antioxidants like carvacrol, t-anethole, and 4-terpineol, and their activities have been reported in different studies (Awadalla
