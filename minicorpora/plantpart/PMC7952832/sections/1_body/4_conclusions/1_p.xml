<p id="Par58">The phytochemical composition and binding affinity of compounds in the oil extract from 
 <italic>Nigella sativa</italic> seed on SARS-CoV-2 molecular targets were investigated. The GC–MS analysis of the oil showed that it contained many compounds with known biological and therapeutic activities. The docking studies of these compounds against some major targets on the SARS-CoV-2 revealed that caryophyllene oxide, α-bergamotene, and β-bisabolene were promising candidates in the inhibition of the activity of these proteins. Their ADMET results further indicated that they would have good pharmacological and pharmacodynamic properties in the human system. There is therefore need for further in vitro, in vivo, and clinical trials to validate the potentials of these compounds in the eradication of the coronavirus pandemic.
