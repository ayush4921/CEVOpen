<p id="Par39">Mature seeds of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> were collected toward the end of rainy season in October 2020 (average temperature 29 °C), from a fallow farmland in Northern Nigeria (N 10° 9′ 32.2524", E 8° 8′ 1.8816"), and no permissions or licenses were required for the collection and study. They were identified by a professional taxonomist Prof. F.N. Mbagwu of the Department of Plant Science and Biotechnology, Imo State University, Owerri, Nigeria, and the voucher specimen was deposited at the Imo State University Herbarium, with herbarium number IMSUH- 468. They were washed with tap water and left to dry on a laminated paper for one week under room conditions. The dried seeds were subjected to preliminary grinding using mortar and pestle, and the particle size was further reduced using an electric blender. The seed powder was transferred in an airtight plastic container and stored in a refrigerator at 4 °C.
