<p id="Par41">The oil sample was characterized using gas chromatography-mass Spectrometer (GC–MS) instrument (Model: 7890 GC and 5977B MSD, Agilent Technologies, USA). An HP-5 MS capillary standard nonpolar column L × I.D., 30 m × 0.25 mm and film thickness 0.25 µm was used. The flow rate of mobile phase (carrier gas: He) was set at 1.0 mL/min. In the gas chromatography part, the temperature program (oven temperature) was set at 40 °C and raised to 250 °C at 5 °C/min and injection volume 1 µL. The oil sample was dissolved in methanol (≥ 99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany) and fully scanned at a range of 40–650 m/z, and the results were compared using NIST mass spectral library search program (El-Sawi et al.
