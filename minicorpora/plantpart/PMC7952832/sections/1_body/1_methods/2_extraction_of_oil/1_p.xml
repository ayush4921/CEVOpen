 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2020</xref>). The seed powder of weight 100 g was encapsulated in a clean white cotton cloth previously degreased in hexane (≥ 98.5%, Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany). The sample was held in the thimble-holder of the extractor which was gradually filled with condensed redistilled hexane from a distillation flask placed on a heating mantle. When the solvent reaches the overflow level in the thimble-holder, it is siphoned back into the distillation flask, carrying the extracted oil with it. The operation was repeated until complete extraction was achieved. The extracted oil was then recovered from the solvent by rotary evaporation.
