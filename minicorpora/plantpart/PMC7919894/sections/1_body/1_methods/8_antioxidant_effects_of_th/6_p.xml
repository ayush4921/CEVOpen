<p>Free radical-scavenging activity of quercetin-3′-
 <italic>O</italic>-β-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucoside isolated from methanol extract of dried skin of 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic>, was evaluated by ORAC assay and results showed that this component could be used as an antioxidant agent (Arung et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Antioxidant properties, including OH radical scavenging effect of quercetin, isorhamnetin-3-glucoside, dipropyl disulphide and dipropyl sulphide extracted from methanol extract of 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic>, were also demonstrated (Teshika et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0127" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>).
