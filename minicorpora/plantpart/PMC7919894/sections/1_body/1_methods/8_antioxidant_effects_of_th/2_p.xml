<p>It was also reported that oral administration of quercetin and piperine (100 mg/kg each) combination once a daily for 7 days, increased antioxidant and induced hepatoprotective effects against oxidative stress induced by paracetamol, in Wistar rats (Mehta et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0085" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Quercetin oxidation metabolite, 2-(3,4-dihydroxybenzoyl)-2,4,6-trihydroxy-3(2H)-benzo-furanone (BZF), showed antioxidant effects at very low nanomolar concentrations (0.03 nM), in its pure form or as part of a plant extract. BZF protected human colonic adenocarcinoma cell line (Caco2 cells) against indomethacin-induced damage (Fuentes et al.
