<p>Enhancement of antioxidant parameters such as SOD, CAT, thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH), and glutathione reductase (GR) and decrease of LPO were observed in the liver of mice infected with 
 <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> after treating with onion powder (2 g/100 g bw/day), (Mantawy et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0083" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). The protective effect of onion extract against doxorubicin-induced hepatotoxicity in rats, was also demonstrated. Doxorubicin, a chemotherapeutic agent, produces cardiotoxicity (Georgiadis et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) and hepatotoxicity via production of free oxygen radicals. However, significant reductions of MDA level, and increased levels of SOD, GSH and GPx were observed in Sprague-Dawley rats after treatment with 1 mL/day aqueous extract of onion, for 14 days (Mete et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0087" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Similarly, aqueous extract of 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic> (100 and 300 mg/kg/day) caused hepato-protective effects by improvement of antioxidant parameters such as SOD, CAT, GPx, GSH and MDA in alloxan-induced diabetic rabbits (Ogunmodede et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0091" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).
