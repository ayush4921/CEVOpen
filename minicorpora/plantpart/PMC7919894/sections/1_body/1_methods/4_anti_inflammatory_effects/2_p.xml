<p>It was observed that 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic> skin extracts decreased cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) mRNA level in J774A.1 mouse macrophage cells treated with LPS (Albishi et al.

In another study, intra-gastric intubation of juice of fresh onion bulbs at a daily dose of 1 mL sngiotensin converting enzyme (CE) for 14 days, inhibited COX and lipoxygenase (LOX) pathways and prevented formation of leukotrienes and thromboxanes in a male Sprague-Dawley rat model of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity (Alpsoy et al.
