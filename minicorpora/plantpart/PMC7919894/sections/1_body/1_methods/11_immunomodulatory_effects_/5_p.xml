<p>Total phenol content (TLC) of Toscana (red onion) bulb extract were tested on immunological cells such as T helper cells (CD4+ cells), cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CD8+ cells), T regulatory cells (CD25high CD4+ cells), and natural killer cells/monocytes (CD16+ cells). The results showed that TLC increased the frequency of antitumor/anti-infection NK CD16+ immune cells (Lisanti et al.

 <italic>A. cepa</italic> (100 mg/mL) inhibited cancer cell growth by induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis through suppressing caspase 8 and 9 and up-regulation of TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptor DR5 and down-regulation of the cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 1 (cIAP-1). Also, polyphenols inhibited phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signalling pathway in human leukemic cells and U937 cells (Han et al.
