<p>The reviewed 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies showed the modulatory effects of 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic> and its constituents on the immune system in various immune dysregulatory disorders. The plant and its components mainly quercetin, reduced Th2 cytokines, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 as well as IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-1β and TNF-α and IgE levels, but increased CD4 cells, IFN-γ level and IFN-γ/IL4 ratio (Th1/Th2 balance), indicating their stimulatory effect on Th1 but inhibitory effect on Th2 activity in inflammatory disorders such as asthma and breast cancer. However, under inflammatory conditions such as osteoclastogenesis induced by LPS in RAW264.7 cells, 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic> and quercetin reduced IL-6 and IL-1α production, but increased IL-3 and IL-4 levels. In animal models of allergic rhinitis, the plant reduced allergic symptoms, eosinophil infiltration of nasal turbinate mucosa, and OVA-specific IgE as well as IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13 and IFN-γ levels. Therefore, the varying types of immunomodulatory effects of 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic> and its constituents were observed in different immune dysregulaton disorders. The above studies showed that 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic> and its constituents especially quercetin, are potential immunomodulatory therapeutic candidates for treatment of disorders with immune dysregulation. 
 <xref rid="t0004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> illustrates immunomodulatory effects of 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic> and its constituents. Based on the described studies, quercetin contributes to immunomodulatory effect of the plant.
