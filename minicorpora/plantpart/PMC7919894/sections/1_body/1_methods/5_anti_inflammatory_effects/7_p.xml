<p>According to Simin et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0118" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), phenolic compounds in methanol extract of 
 <italic>Allium flavum</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>flavum</italic> or small yellow onion (71 and 81 µg/mL), including 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric, caffeic, 
 <italic>p</italic>-hydroxybenzoic, vanillic, protocatechuic and syringic acid, rutin, quercetin-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucoside and kaempferol-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucoside, expressed a high inhibitory potential for COX-1 and 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX) activity. The methanol extract inhibited cell growth of cervix epithelioid carcinoma and colon adenocarcinoma cells. Phenolic compounds in soluble extracts of pearl onion skin at concentrations as low as 5 µg/mL, showed an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and DNA scission inhibitory activity and inhibition of COX-2 expression and LDL cholesterol oxidation (Albishi et al.
