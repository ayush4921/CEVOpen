0: In our modern processes of agriculture, an extensive use of pesticides has been made; this use has brought a series of consequences that go from environmental to health problems.
1: The presence of pesticide residues in agricultural use ground is increasing every time.
2: Due to these kind of problems pesticides constitute an environmental risk and an important source of human exposition ( Rojas et al., 2019,  Mostafalou and Abdollahi, 2017).
3: This fact has resulted in an increase in the type of analytical techniques used in the detection of agricultural chemical residues to make a better controller of crop products ( Garcia et al., 2017,  Morena, 2015), and their impact on humans and the environment.
4: In addition, the use of pesticides has the consequence that many organisms, such as insects, become resistant to their use.
5: For this reason, today more environmentally friendly alternatives are being developed around the world to try to mitigate the adverse effects of pesticides in the environment.
6: Many of these alternatives have consisted of using natural products, such as plant extracts and essential oils instead of these agrochemicals ( Pavela and Benelli, 2016,  Abdelli et al., 2016).
