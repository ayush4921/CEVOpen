<p id="p0060">The chemical characterization of the different samples of essential oils was carried out in order to check that the oils supplied by Logibell Company presented different chemical composition. All oil samples were liquid at room temperature, were volatile, colorless and have density less than unity. 
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the results for the refractive index of the analyzed samples, finding that there are differences from the third significant number in the index of refraction, which indicates that there may be changes in the chemical composition of the oils, due to the electrical treatment to which the oils were subjected. A more precise analytical technique was used to corroborate this phenomenon. The following section shows the results of gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry analysis.
