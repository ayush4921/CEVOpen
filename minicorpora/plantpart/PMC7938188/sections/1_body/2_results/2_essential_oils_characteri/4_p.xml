<p id="p0070">According to 
 <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, it was found that most of the compounds present are monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, which is in agreement with what is reported in the literature for this type of samples; being found that the compounds limonene, linalool and caryophillene appear in all the samples, while the limonene oxide, 
 <italic>cis</italic>-carveol, α-copaene, β-elemene, β-cubenene, citronellol, terpineol and β-citral appear in most of the samples. According to 
 <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, sample 8, which was not subjected to electrical treatment, presents the highest percentage of limonene (72.0%) and the only sample where the presence of carvacrol (0.5%), valencene (0.5%) and nuciferol (0.9%) was detected; physically this sample showed the most yellow coloration and greater odor was perceived with respect to the treated samples. Although in sample 1 the concentration of limonene (64.9%) and linalool (3.9%) decreases with respect to sample 8; the concentration of 
 <italic>cis</italic>-carveol (4.9%) and limonene oxide (2.2%) are the highest in the samples studied; while 
 <italic>p</italic>- Mentha-2,8-dien-1-ol (0.9%) and 1-decanol (3.5%) were only detected in this sample. Sample 2 has the closest percentage of detected metabolites to those reported in the reference sample and is the only one in which the presence of 2,4-Undecadien-1-ol (2.4%) was detected. The most significant decrease in the percentages of limonene (49.1%) and linalool (2.9%) with respect to the reference sample was found in sample 3, but at the same time it presents the highest concentrations of α-copaene (2.9%); β-elemene (7.1%), caryophyllene (5.5%), eremophyllene (2.2%), spathulenol (3.4%), Caryophyllene oxide (1.2%) and cadinene (1.2%); the presence of decanal and α-humulene was detected exclusively in sample 3, and this sample presented the lowest odor and was more translucent. Sample 4 was characterized by presenting the highest percentages of citronellol (1.6%), 1,6-dihydrocarveol (3.0%) and β-pinene (3.1%). Terpinen-4-ol and thymol only appeared in this sample. In sample 5 there was a high percentage of rhodinol (4.0%) compared to the other samples. The presence of 8-hydroxilinalool (1.0%), myrtenol (1.5%), isopinocamfone (1.6%) and gurjunene (0.4%) was detected exclusively. A high percentage of terpineol (14.6%) was detected in sample 6 and was the only sample where 3-carene (0.4%) and decanoic acid (2.8%) were detected. Finally, the highest percentage of linalool (6.4%), β-citral (1.8%), 2-undecenal l (2.8%) was found in sample 7. The presence or absence of some compounds is due to the fact that they are generally intermediaries in the biosynthetic routes of other metabolites present in orange oils.
