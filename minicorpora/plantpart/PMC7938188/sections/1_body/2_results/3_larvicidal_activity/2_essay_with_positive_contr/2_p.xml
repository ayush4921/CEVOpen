<p id="p0075">Imidacloprid, belonging to the neonicotinoid family (
 <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">Denecke et al., 2017</xref>) was used as a positive control. The LC
 <sub>50</sub> value found for the 
 <italic>Canton S</italic> strain was 16.395Â ppm. This result indicates that the strain is sensitive to the xenobiotic used and allows us to have a reference point to compare the lethality of different oil samples.
