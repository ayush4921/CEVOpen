 <xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>; was found that the lethality results in 
 <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> larvae are not better than the lethality presented by the positive control, that is, the artificial variation in the chemical composition following the protocol of the company Logibell S.A.S does not improve the larvicidal action of orange oils. This is demonstrated by the fact that the sample that was not subjected to artificial variation in its composition (sample 8) presented higher lethality values than the other samples, except for sample number 3 at concentrations of 500 ppm and 5000 ppm. Statistically it is found that in most treated samples the lethality results are below the average of the untreated sample with electric pulses; sample 8 shows higher lethality at 10000 ppm. From 
 <xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> it was observed that of the modified samples, sample 1 at 100 ppm has the highest lethality (28.33%). We found that at 100 ppm the lethality of samples two, three and five are very similar (around 21.67%), the same behavior is observed in samples four and five at 10,000 ppm (around 36.67%); but equal lethality was found in samples six and seven at 500 ppm and in samples one, six and seven at 5,000 ppm. If only the modified samples are compared, sample 3 had the highest lethality at 500, 1000, 5000 and 10000 ppm; while sample 7 had the lowest lethality at 100 and 1000 ppm; sample 2 had the lowest lethality at 500 and 10000 ppm and at 5000 ppm sample 4 had the lowest lethality. We found that the lethality of samples two, four, five, six and seven did not exceed 40% lethality at any of the concentrations tested.
