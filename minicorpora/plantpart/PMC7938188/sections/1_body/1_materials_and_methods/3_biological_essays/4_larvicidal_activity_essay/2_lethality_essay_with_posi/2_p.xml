 <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">Panchal and Tiwari, 2017</xref>); in order to determine LC
 <sub>50</sub> were exposed for 7 days to various concentrations of imidacloprid (0, 10, 100, 1000 and 10000 ppm) mixed to the diet. 50 µL solution of the compound was mixed with 4 g of the diet and placed in Petri dishes. The number of dead and alive flies was recorded daily for 7 days. A control diet was treated with 50 µL of ethanol. Treated and control insects were held at the same condition used for colony maintenance. For each concentration, we performed tests three times. These treatments contemplated two repetitions in the shortest time to reduce the experimental error (
