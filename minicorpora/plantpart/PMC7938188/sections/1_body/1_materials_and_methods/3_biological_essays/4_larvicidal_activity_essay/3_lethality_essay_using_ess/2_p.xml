<p id="p0045">The procedure described above for selection and treatment of larvae was used. Concentrations of 0, 100, 500, 1000, 5000 and 10000 ppm were tested for each oil sample; 50 µL solution of each oil sample was mixed with 4 g of the diet and placed in Petri dishes. A control diet was treated with 50 µL of ethanol. The number of dead and alive flies was recorded daily for 7 days (

For each concentration, we performed tests three times. These treatments contemplated two repetitions in the shortest time to reduce the experimental error (
