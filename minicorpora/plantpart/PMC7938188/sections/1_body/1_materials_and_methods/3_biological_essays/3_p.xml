<p id="p0035">For the genetic homogenization of the strain, through the crossing of five “parental” couples (P), to obtain a first generation (F1) once the progeny are obtained parents eliminated leaving only F1 for crossovers. To obtain (F2) at least ten pairs of (F1) were taken and crossed, where again the parents were eliminated before the adults of the new generation emerged in order to avoid crossing individuals of two different generations. This is how it was obtained (F3), this progeny was used for the experiment, and thus it was guaranteed that the mortality was only due to the toxicity of the treatment that was applied (
