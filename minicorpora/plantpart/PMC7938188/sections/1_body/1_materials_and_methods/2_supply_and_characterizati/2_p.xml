<p id="p0015">The samples of essential oils of 
 <italic>Citrus sinensis</italic> L. extracted from de orange peel were supplied by the company Logibell S.A.S located in Sincelejo city (Sucre -Colombia). This company provided a total of eight samples of essential oils; one sample that was extracted by conventional methods that was used as a reference, and seven samples of orange oils that were subjected to artificial modification of their chemical composition using electrical pulses and the company's home made methods. Orange essential oils were treated on a pilot scale, using a continuous pulsed electric field (PEF). The orange oils were pumped through the treatment chamber to subject the PEF treatment to 30 kVcm
 <sup>−1</sup>–50 kVcm
 <sup>−1</sup>. 100 keystrokes were applied; using continuous pulses for 2 h. To check that there was a difference in the chemical composition of the different oil samples supplied, the refractive index was calculated and a GC–MS analysis was performed as described in the following sections.
