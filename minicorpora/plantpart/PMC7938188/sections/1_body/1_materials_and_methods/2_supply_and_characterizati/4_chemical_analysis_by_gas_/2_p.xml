<p id="p0025">The analysis of all essential oils was performed using a gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) system consisting of an Agilent Technologies 7890A gas chromatograph coupled to a 5975 mass spectrometer. The chromatographic separation was carried out using an HP-5 capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d. × 0.25 μm film thickness). The initial column temperature of 45 °C was held for 2 min and increased by 3 °C/min to 280 °C; the temperature was then held there for 30 min. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 25 mL/min. The injector temperature was maintained at 250 °C. The samples were injected at 1 μL in split mode. The percentage composition was calculated by integrating the peak areas of the spectrograms.</p>
