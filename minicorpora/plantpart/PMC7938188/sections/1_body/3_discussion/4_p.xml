<p id="p0100">Taking into account that the objective of the work was to check if the modifications in the chemical composition of the orange oils caused a variation in the larvicidal activity; the bioassay was initiated using imidacloprid as a positive control. The LC
 <sub>50</sub> value found for the 
 <italic>Canton S</italic> strain was 16.395Â ppm, this result indicates that the strain is sensitive to this insecticide. As shown in 
 <xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, none of the reported concentrations are close to the lethal concentration 50 of imidacloprid. Nevertheless, mortality rate for all oils was low prevented estimation of LC
 <sub>50</sub> in all cases. Therefore, presently investigated in this work essential oils are likely ineffective as natural insecticide. According to the above, it is recommended to continue testing variations in the refining processes through the use of electric pulses in order to obtain oils with a higher biological activity with lethality comparable to the reference synthetic insecticides.
