<p id="p0110">Finally, it was observed that the relationship between lethality and the concentration applied to the larvae did not follow a linear behavior, this phenomenon has been observed in insects where the concentrations can stimulate the response mechanism according to the effect caused to their homeostasis, product of the xenobiotic used, this tends to be related to an adaptive response (
 <xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">Raymond and López-Martínez, 2020</xref>); the non-linearity can also be explained because the orange oil samples may contain metabolites that act as antagonists of other metabolites, and the biological activity may vary according to the concentrations of the metabolites present.
