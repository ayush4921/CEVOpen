<p id="p0115">In conclusion, it was found that the artificial modification in the chemical composition of orange oils causes variation in their larvicidal action; noting that the biological activity could depend in direct relation to the concentration of limonene present in the samples, since when the concentration of limonene decreased, a decrease in lethality was observed; For this reason, the oil sample that was not subjected to treatment with electric pulses generally showed greater larvicidal action on 
 <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> when compared to the modified oils used in this study.
