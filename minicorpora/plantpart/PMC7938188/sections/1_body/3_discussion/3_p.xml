<p id="p0095">In order to verify that the modification in the oil samples, a CG-MS analysis was carried out and it was found that the application of electric pulses carried out an effective modification in the chemical composition of the essential oil, since the concentration of the metabolites increased or decreased according to the variation applied, even some new compounds appear in the different samples that had not been detected, possibly due to their low concentration or some of the metabolites act as biological precursors of others. When reviewing the results of the CG-MS, we found the presence of metabolites that act as precursors of others, for example limonene can react in different ways and produce compounds such as carvone,

 <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> there are compounds that through some biosynthesis routes can be precursors of limonene such as pinene, which can also be used for the production of linalool; a similar situation occurs with humulene, which is a precursor of caryophyllene (
 <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">Carrillo, et al., 2019</xref>). The outcomes found indicate that it is possible to develop routes of artificial biosynthesis of metabolites in essential oils, so it is important to further optimize this process in order to obtain samples of oils enriched with metabolites that enhance a particular biological activity. Therefore, a possible application of the technology used in this work may be the transformation of monoterpenes into compounds that provide greater chemical stability to those of essential oils, or to achieve an increase in the presence of oxygenated metabolites that can give rise to more water-soluble oil. Advances in technology of this type may lead to future alternatives in insect control and even commercial applications such as the manufacture of more stable oils with better organoleptic characteristics and greater commercial value.
