<p id="p0090">In an attempt to find alternatives to replace the use of synthetic insecticides; the company Logibell S.A.S using electrical pulses modified the chemical composition of oils extracted from orange (
 <italic>Citrus sinensis</italic> L.), in order to test whether these modifications had an effect on the lethality in 
 <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> larvae. Through this innovative approach it was possible to change the proportions in which the metabolites were detected in the treated samples. It was found that the refractive index of the samples was different from the reference sample, indicating that the mole fraction of the compounds present has been altered (

Although essential oils have been catalogued as potential biological actives; structural modifications of these oils are becoming more common, so in recent years there has been mention of the use of electrical pulses as a means of modifying these substances (
