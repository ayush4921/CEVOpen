 <p id="Par1">We conducted a series of experiments to test insect embryo capability to survive and increase reproductive investment during early development after short exposure to essential oils. We used 
  <italic>Callosobruchus maculatus</italic> as a model insect and eucalyptus leaf and flower essential oils. Both essential oils exhibited toxicity against 
  <italic>C. maculatus</italic> embryos and adults. However, flower essential oil was more toxic. A fetus exposed to essential oils tried to make the best of a bad situation and compensate essential oils harmful effects in the later life stages. Insect progeny production guarantee resulted in a trade-off between reproduction and female longevity. The insect also could alter fitness and reproductive behavior including, mating latency reduction, copulation duration increase, and copulation success rate raise in adulthood. Flower essential oil-exposed embryos were more successful in increasing copulation duration, and leaf essential oil-exposed embryos achieved more copulation success and less mating latency. These consequences persisted until F1 generation that was not directly exposed to essential oil. However, the F2 generation could concur with the harmful effects of essential oils. 
  <italic>C. maculatus</italic> embryo might use epigenetic mechanisms to guarantee progeny production. Reproductive behavior changes and the trade-off can be evolutionary mechanisms to save species from possible extinction in deleterious situations.
