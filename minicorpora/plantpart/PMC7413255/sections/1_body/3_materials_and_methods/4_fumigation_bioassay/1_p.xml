<p id="Par41">We used the newly emerged (&lt; 24 h-old) adults of 
 <italic>C. maculatus</italic> to set up the fumigation bioassay. We deposited each ten freshly emerged adults in a Petri dish (diameter 60 mm), which its top covered with filter paper. Based on an initial dose-setting experiment, 2, 3, 5, and 6 µl of 
 <italic>E. camaldulensis</italic> leaf and flower essential oils (corresponding to essential oil concentrations of 75.7, 113.55, 189.25 and 227.1 µl/l
 <sub>air</sub>) were applied to the filter paper pieces. We used the same concentrations for both leaf and flower essential oils to be able to compare different effects of essential oils. Then, the Petri dishes' edges were sealed with parafilm. Each concentration and control (without essential oil) was replicated four times. Mortality was recorded at 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h after treatments. Insects with no movement of leg or antenna were considered as dead
