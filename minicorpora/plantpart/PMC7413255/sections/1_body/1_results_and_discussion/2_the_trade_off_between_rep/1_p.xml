 <italic>C. maculatus</italic> and significantly decreased hatch rate by about 50% (56.6 ± 3.3% for flower essential oil and 50 ± 1.5% for leaf essential oil). The control egg hatch rate was 83.33 ± 3.3% (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). Interestingly, survivors could compensate harmful effects of embryo exposure to essential oils, and hence, control and treatments had statistically the same larval duration (Fig.

For example, insects that experience a period of lack of food and nutrition grow faster than those who were in a normal situation to compensate for initial failure
