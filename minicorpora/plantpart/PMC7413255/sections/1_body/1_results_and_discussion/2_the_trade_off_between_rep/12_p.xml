<p id="Par27">We recorded the F2 generation egg number and hatch rate to realize if the effects of short-time exposure of the embryo to essential oil could be passed on to future generations after the F1 generation. The F2 generation could completely concur with the deleterious effects of essential oils, and; thus, egg numbers and hatching rates were statistically the same in treatments and control (Supplementary Fig.Â
