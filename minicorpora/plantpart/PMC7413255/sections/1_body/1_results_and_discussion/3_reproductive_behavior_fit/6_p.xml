<p id="Par33">In F1 generation, both essential oil groups were still affected by their parents early-life exposure to essential oils; hence, both improved fitness by reproductive behavioral changes and male copulation success rate increased (85.7% and 71.42% for flower and leaf essential oils, respectively) in contrast to control (50%) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). There was no significant difference in other reproductive behaviors in the F1 generation (Fig.
