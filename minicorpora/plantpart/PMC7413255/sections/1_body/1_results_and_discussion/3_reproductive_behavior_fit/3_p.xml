<p id="Par30">Our results showed that flower essential oil-exposed embryos struggled to fight against future deleterious effects of essential oil on their potential reproductive success and finally were significantly more successful in increasing copulation duration time (264.4 s) compared to control (207.1) and leaf essential oil group (209.3) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>d). 
 <italic>C. maculatus</italic> females prefer short copulations due to physical injuries to their reproductive tracts

 <italic>Ceriagrion tenellum</italic>, and two aphidophagous ladybirds

 </sup>, prolonged copulations not only did not hurt 
 <italic>C. maculatus</italic> females but also could increase lifetime fecundity and material benefit that females derive from the increased ejaculate size. Females with long copulation duration deposited more eggs than females with shorter copulations.
