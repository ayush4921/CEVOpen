<p id="Par15">Flower essential oil reached 100% mortality after 24 h at the highest concentration (227.1 µl/l
 <sub>air</sub>), while leaf essential oil caused 70% mortality at the same concentration and time point (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Median lethal time (LT
