<p id="Par10">Mortality of 
 <italic>C. maculatus</italic> adults increased with increasing oil concentration and time of exposure. The flower essential oil showed a more robust fumigant activity. For example, LC
 <sub>50</sub> at 24 h was 132.7 µl/l
 <sub>air</sub> for the flower essential oil compared to 174.2 µl/l
 <sub>air</sub> for the leaves (Supplementary Table
