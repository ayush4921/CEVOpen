<p id="Par8">To the best of our knowledge, insect embryo ability to survive against exposure to plant essential oil and compensate the damages to product progeny has not well-discussed. In this study, we used the cowpea weevil, 
 <italic>Callosobruchus maculatus</italic> (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), as a model insect and 
 <italic>Eucalyptus camaldulensis</italic> (Myrtales: Myrtaceae) flower and leaf essential oils to study probable attempt and success of embryo to avoid reproduction failure in adulthood by improving behavioral fitness.
