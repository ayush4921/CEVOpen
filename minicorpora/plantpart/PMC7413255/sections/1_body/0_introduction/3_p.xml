<p id="Par4">Plant essential oils have been used for arthropod pest control as promising attractive alternatives to many synthetic pesticides because of their fast degradability properties, safety to humans and environment, and especially in case of pesticide resistance developing. Essential oils as fumigants or contact insecticides influence insect physiology by disruption of primary metabolic pathways result in rapid death, longevity reduction, and alteration of oviposition. Plant volatiles could also cause behavioral responses in insects and synergize or increase insect responses to sex pheromones
