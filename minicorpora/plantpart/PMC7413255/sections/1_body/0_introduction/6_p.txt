0: Epigenetic mechanisms can be exploited to alter gene expression.
1: Immediate changes in gene expression are involved in not only the toxin metabolism but also critical biological processes.
2: Some of the changes in gene expression are transient, and some epigenetic changes could be persistent and last after termination of exposure.
3: Some even inherited in later generations that did not experience exposure directly.
4: Epigenetic changes take place in hours, but the results could proceed for a lifetime 13,  14.
