<p id="Par7">Epigenetic mechanisms can be exploited to alter gene expression. Immediate changes in gene expression are involved in not only the toxin metabolism but also critical biological processes. Some of the changes in gene expression are transient, and some epigenetic changes could be persistent and last after termination of exposure. Some even inherited in later generations that did not experience exposure directly. Epigenetic changes take place in hours, but the results could proceed for a lifetime
