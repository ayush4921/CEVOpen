0: Scientists have demonstrated environmental stimulus (such as a toxin or toxicant exposure) could lead to organism gene expression changes to overcome a new situation.
1: Epigenetic is changes in gene expression by heritable modifications to the DNA molecule but not gene sequence base changes because of different environmental stressors.
2: It can lead to heritable adaptation in natural populations 12.
