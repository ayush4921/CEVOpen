 <caption> Effect of eucalyptus leaf and flower essential oils (EO) on different copulation parameters of C. maculatus F0 generation. ( a) F0 mating latency (s); ( b) F0 kicking phase start; ( c) F0 kicking duration (s); ( d) F0 copulation duration (s). Both essential oils significantly decreased male mating latency, and flower essential oil significantly increased copulation duration ( P &lt; 0.05). Essential oils did not impact female kicking phase start and duration. </caption>
