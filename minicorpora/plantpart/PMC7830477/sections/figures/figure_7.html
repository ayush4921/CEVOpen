 <caption> Proposed mechanisms of the antioxidative actions of Pistacia lentiscus var. chia. Mastic essential oil confers a cytoprotective effect against H 2O 2- and UV-induced oxidative stress in skin epithelial cells by inducing NRF2 mRNA expression and subsequently upregulating the Nrf2–ARE pathway, which plays a fundamental role in maintaining cellular redox homeostasis. Under normal conditions, NRF2 is constitutively expressed at low levels, being repressed mainly by KEAP1 through ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. When NRF2 is activated in response to oxidative stress it gets released from KEAP1, thereby avoiding degradation, and is translocated to the nucleus, where it binds to ARE along with the small musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma protein (sMaf) in the promoter regions of various antioxidant response proteins and phase II detoxifying enzymes. Activated ARE-driven downstream antioxidant defense mechanisms will lead to the restoration of normal physiological conditions and to the alleviation of oxidative stress. We propose that mastic essential oil activates the Nrf2–ARE pathway by inducing NRF2 expression, which potentially influences the pathway at different stages (e.g., expression, degradation, and activation), leading ultimately to the upregulation of the pathway and the transcriptional activation of antioxidant response proteins. The exact details of the mechanisms remain unknown and require further investigation (dashed lines). Mastic essential oil also exerts enhanced cell regeneration and wound healing actions. </caption>
