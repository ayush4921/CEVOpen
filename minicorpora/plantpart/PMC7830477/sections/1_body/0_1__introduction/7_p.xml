<p>In the present study, we were prompted to investigate the potential direct or indirect antioxidant effects of mastic oil, which was studied for its anticancer properties in a previous report [
 <xref rid="B17-antioxidants-10-00127" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], along with its major constituents, myrcene and 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene. For this reason, we initially evaluated their cell-free antioxidant capacity via DPPH, ABTS, and plasmid DNA protection assays, while we examined their indirect in vitro antioxidant properties by investigating their effect on gene regulation of a panel of genes related to the antioxidant response in human keratinocyte HaCaT cells. Additionally, we assayed the cytoprotective properties of mastic oil, myrcene, and 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene under H
