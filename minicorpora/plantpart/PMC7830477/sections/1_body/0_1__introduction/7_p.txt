0: In the present study, we were prompted to investigate the potential direct or indirect antioxidant effects of mastic oil, which was studied for its anticancer properties in a previous report [ 17], along with its major constituents, myrcene and  -pinene.
1: For this reason, we initially evaluated their cell-free antioxidant capacity via DPPH, ABTS, and plasmid DNA protection assays, while we examined their indirect in vitro antioxidant properties by investigating their effect on gene regulation of a panel of genes related to the antioxidant response in human keratinocyte HaCaT cells.
2: Additionally, we assayed the cytoprotective properties of mastic oil, myrcene, and  -pinene under H 2O 2- and UVB-induced oxidative stress conditions, as well as their healing properties in HaCaT cells.
