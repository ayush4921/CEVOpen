<p>The bioavailability of mastic essential oil or its major components has not been thoroughly investigated. However, there are several reports that suggest that the terpenes, α-pinene, and myrcene present in the mastic oil are absorbed by humans and demonstrate their bioavailability pattern following oral administration [

More specifically, blood samples from human volunteers were collected at different time points before and after oral consumption of mastic oil. Following monitoring by GC-MS, it was determined that α-pinene and myrcene significantly increased following 0.5 h of essential oil administration and remained significantly increased at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 24 h. An increase in serum lipid resistance to oxidation was also observed, which was significant at 1 to 4 h and peaked at 2 h after consumption [
