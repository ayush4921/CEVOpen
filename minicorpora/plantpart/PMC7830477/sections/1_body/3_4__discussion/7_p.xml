<p>Finally, the potential wound healing properties of mastic oil and its major constituents were studied via the in vitro scratch assay. Our data indicated that Chios mastic oil, myrcene, and α-pinene exhibit promising migratory and regenerative properties in HaCaT cells. To the extent of our knowledge, this is the first time that the wound healing potential of mastic oil, myrcene, or α-pinene is being reported. There are scarce reports in the literature associating mastic gum with increased reinforcement of surgical adhesive strips [

It is quite interesting that various bioactive compounds that act as NRF2 inducers also accelerate the wound healing process [
