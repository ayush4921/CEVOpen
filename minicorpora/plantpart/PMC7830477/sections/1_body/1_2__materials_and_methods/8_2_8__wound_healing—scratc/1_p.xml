<p>A scratch assay was performed as previously described [
 <xref rid="B30-antioxidants-10-00127" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. HaCaT cells were grown in 12-well plates and following confluency were serum-starved and a scratch was introduced with a pipette tip to mimic the formation of a “wound”. After wounding, cells were washed twice with serum-free medium to remove cell debris and treated with different doses of mastic oil, myrcene, or 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene (0, 5, 10, 20 μg/mL). Photographs of the same fields were taken with a ZEISS Primovert light microscope (Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany) equipped with a digital camera (Axiocam ERc 5 s) at 0 and 12 h. The open wound area was calculated using Image J software (ImageJ; NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). The relative ratio of wound closure was determined by calculating the ratio of the open surface area at 12 h to that at the initial time of wounding.
