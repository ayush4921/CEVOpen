<p>For the cytotoxicity assays, 10
 <sup>4</sup> HaCaT cells were seeded in 96-well plates for 24 h and then treated with a range of concentrations of mastic oil (1.7–222.5 μg/mL), myrcene (1.6–202.5 μg/mL), or 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene (1.7–217.5 μg/mL) for either 24 h or 48 h, before processing via the SRB assay. Stock solutions of test substances were dissolved in DMSO (1:1 
 <italic>v/v</italic>) and then serial dilutions were performed in culture medium to achieve the desired range of concentrations. The final concentration of DMSO did not exceed 0.025% (
 <italic>v/v</italic>). For the evaluation of the cytoprotective effects of the essential oil and its individual components against UVB, HaCaT cells were seeded in 96-well plates 24 h prior to the experiment and subsequently treated with the desired substance at various concentrations (0, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80 μg/mL) for 24 h. Following incubation, cells were UVB-irradiated (55 mJ/cm
 <sup>2</sup>) and then left to recover for 24 h in fresh medium before proceeding with the SRB assay. In the case of post-treatment with the test substances, HaCaT cells were seeded in 96-well plates for 24 h, their medium was freshly replaced, then they were left to further incubate for another 24 h. Following incubation, cells were UVB-irradiated (55 mJ/cm
 <sup>2</sup>) and then allowed to recover for 24 h in the presence of the desired substance under a range of concentrations (0, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80 μg/mL) before proceeding with the SRB assay. Finally, for H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> treatment, HaCaT cells were treated 24 h post-plating, either with or without 10 μg/mL of each compound for 24 h. Subsequently, cells were treated with or without 0.2 mM H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> for another 24, before proceeding with the SRB assay.
