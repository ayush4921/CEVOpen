<p>The DNA nicking assay was performed as described earlier with minor modifications [
 <xref rid="B29-antioxidants-10-00127" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Briefly, 2 μL of plasmid DNA (pUC19) were mixed with 10 μL of Fenton’s reagent (30 mM H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, 50 mM ascorbic acid, and 80 mM FeCl
 <sub>3</sub>), followed by the addition of different dilutions of mastic oil, myrcene, or 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene (0.002–2 mg/mL) to a final volume of 20 μL in ddH
 <sub>2</sub>O. After a 30 min incubation period at 37 °C, bromophenol blue dye (0.25% in 50% glycerol) was added. The reaction mixtures were then loaded on a 0.8% agarose gel and electrophoresis was carried out at 90 V for 1 h followed by ethidium bromide staining. The closed circular, linear, and relaxed forms of pUC19 were visualized and quantified using GelDoc EQ system (Biorad, Segrate, Italy).
