<p>In the absence of immediate antioxidant protection, we were prompted to examine the potential enhancement of indirect antioxidant cellular defense caused by these substances. The effects of mastic oil and its major constituents were studied in the human immortalized keratinocyte HaCaT cell line under normal and oxidative stress conditions. HaCaT cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of mastic oil, myrcene, or α-pinene for 24 and 48 h, and cell viability was monitored by the SRB assay. Cell viability curves were plotted to determine the safe range of concentrations to use in subsequent experiments. None of the samples exhibited significant cytotoxicity against HaCaT cells at all the range of concentrations tested. Cytotoxicity was not greater than 50%, with the exception of the 48 h treatment with 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene at concentrations higher than 100 μg/mL (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 105.5 ± 8.9 μg/mL) (
