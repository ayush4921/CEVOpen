<p>Next, the potential cytoprotective and regenerative effects of mastic oil, myrcene, and 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene against UVB radiation were assessed. HaCaT cells were seeded in 96-well plates and treatments with mastic oil, myrcene, or 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene were performed in two different experimental setups, following a pre-treatment or a post-treatment protocol. In the case of the pre-treatment protocol, HaCaT cells were treated with 0, 5, 10, 20, 40, or 80 μg/mL mastic oil, myrcene, or 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene for 24 h. Then, cells were irradiated with 55 mJ/cm
 <sup>2</sup> UVB to induce a drop in cell viability at approximately 50% [
 <xref rid="B19-antioxidants-10-00127" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and allowed to recover for 24 h. Subsequently, their viability was estimated by SRB assay. In the case of the post-treatment protocol, cells were irradiated with 55 mJ/cm
 <sup>2</sup> UVB radiation and then treated for 24 h with 0, 5, 10, 20, 40, or 80 μg/mL mastic oil, myrcene, or 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene. After the 24 h post-treatment, their viability was estimated via SRB assay. Our results indicate that pre-treatment with mastic oil significantly increased the cell viability of HaCaT cells in a dose-dependent manner (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-10-00127-f004">Figure 4</xref>a). However, post-treatment with mastic oil resulted in no significant protection effect (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-10-00127-f004">Figure 4</xref>a). The opposite pattern was observed for myrcene. Specifically, pre-treatment of HaCaT cells with myrcene prior to UVB irradiation had no effect on their viability, while post-treated cells retained their viability in a statistically significant and dose-dependent manner (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-10-00127-f004">Figure 4</xref>b). Finally, 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene did not exhibit any cytoprotective effect, neither when applied before nor after UVB irradiation in HaCaT cells (
