<p>The antioxidant potential of mastic essential oil, myrcene, and 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene was further investigated via the DNA protection assay from damage caused by Fenton’s reaction. This assay aims to evaluate the ability of the test substances to protect plasmid DNA from damage caused by hydroxyl radicals produced via Fenton’s reaction. Hydroxyl radicals are capable of reacting with nucleotides in DNA, causing the formation of cleavages [
 <xref rid="B31-antioxidants-10-00127" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Plasmid DNA pUC19 was mixed with Fenton’s reagent to induce hydroxyl radicals, and the protection from the genotoxic effects of free hydroxyl radicals was evaluated in the presence of increasing concentrations of mastic oil, myrcene, or 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene. Control plasmid DNA runs were performed in 3 distinct conformations in gel electrophoresis (relaxed (R), linear (L), and circular (C)), with circular being the predominant form (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-10-00127-f001">Figure 1</xref>, lane 1). In the presence of the Fenton reagent, the plasmid DNA adopts a supersaturated configuration due to the nicking effect created by the free hydroxyl radicals (L, linear form) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-10-00127-f001">Figure 1</xref>, lane 2). Our results indicate that neither mastic oil nor its components, myrcene and 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene, managed to inhibit DNA oxidation and cleavage under any condition tested (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-10-00127-f001">Figure 1</xref>, lanes 7–10). The increasing concentrations of mastic oil, myrcene, or 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene demonstrated no effect on plasmid DNA conformation under non-oxidative conditions either (
