<p>Next, we examined whether treatment with the mastic oil, myrcene, or 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene could affect gene regulation of a panel of genes related with the cellular antioxidant response mechanisms. For this purpose, 10
 <sup>6</sup> HaCaT cells were seeded in 100 mm plates and treated with 5, 10, or 20 μg/mL mastic oil, myrcene, or 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene for 24 h. Cells were then harvested and their total RNA was isolated in order to synthesise cDNA and perform comparative real-time PCR for the genes of interest. Our results showed that treatment with all test substances resulted in significant upregulation of 
 <italic>NRF2</italic> transcription factor, as well as its target genes 
 <italic>GSTP1</italic>, 
 <italic>SOD1</italic>, 
 <italic>NQO1</italic>, 
 <italic>GPX1</italic>, 
 <italic>GSR</italic>, 
 <italic>HMOX1</italic>, and 
 <italic>CAT</italic>. Specifically, in the case of treatment with mastic oil, maximum upregulation was achieved with the lowest concentration used (5 μg/mL) for expression of 
 <italic>GSTP1</italic>, 
 <italic>SOD1</italic>, 
 <italic>NRF2</italic>, and 
 <italic>NQO1</italic>, while a dose-dependent increase was observed for the expression of 
 <italic>GPX1</italic> (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-10-00127-f003">Figure 3</xref>b). In the case of treatment with 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene, a dose-dependent effect was apparent for the expression of most of the genes studied (
