<p>Finally, we investigated whether mastic oil, myrcene, or 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene has the potential to induce healing using the scratch assay. Our data demonstrate that in the presence of mastic oil or myrcene, the wounds were healed more rapidly compared to control (

 <italic>α</italic>-pinene also resulted in faster recovery, however not in a dose-dependent manner (
