0: As part of our work on the essential oils of  Tetraclinis articulata [ 1], this plant is a very slow-growing coniferous species, longevity of which may exceed 400 years.
1: In height, the annual increment is estimated to be 20 cm/year up to 25 years and 10 cm/year up to 60 years.
2: In diameter, it is 3 to 4 mm/year up to 30 years and 1.5 to 2.5 mm/year up to 60 years.
3: These numbers depend on several parameters, including soil depth and annual precipitation [ 2].
