<p>Also, El Jemli et al. [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] studied the antioxidant power of the essential oils of the 
 <italic>Thuja</italic> leaves collected in the Marrakech region, and the majority of which are bornyl acetate (26.8%) and camphor (22.4%), followed by the 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene (7.2%) and borneol (6.4%). These essential oils have low antioxidant activity, with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> obtained by the DPPH test, the order of 12.05 × 103 ± 0.24 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, significantly lower than the standard (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 4.20 ± 0.02 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL).
