<p>Ben Jemia et al. [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] studied the antioxidant activity of the essential oil of 
 <italic>Thuja</italic> leaves from Tunisia. The results of the DPPH test showed a low activity, with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of the order of 25.50 ± 0.57 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, two times less important than that of the positive control (BHT) (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 12.0 ± 0.13 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL). It should be noted that bornyl acetate (31.4%), 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene (24.5%), and camphor (20.3%) are the majority constituents of this essential oil.
