<p>The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was evaluated according to published procedures [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]; these concentrations were determined by the CLSI microdilution method (2006) on 96-well round bottomed microplates with some modifications. For a concentration of 10
 <sup>5</sup> cfu/mL, 10
 <sup>8</sup> cfu/mL bacterial suspensions were diluted 1/1000 with the same culture medium (TS).
