<p>Three chromatographic analyses were performed, and the essential oil was analyzed on a Hewlett-Packard Gas Chromatograph Model 5890 coupled to a Hewlett-Packard Model 5971, equipped with a DB5 MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm; 0.25 
 <italic>μ</italic>m), programming from 50°C (5 min) to 300°C at 5°C/min, with a 5-min hold. The helium was used as the carrier gas (1.0 mL/min); injection was in split mode (1:30); injector and detector temperatures were 250°C and 280°C, respectively. The mass spectrometer worked in EI mode at 70 eV, electron multiplier at 2500 V, and ion source temperature at 180°C; MS data were acquired in the scan mode in the m/
 <italic>z</italic> range 33–450.
