 <p>The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare the antioxidant and antibacterial activities of essential oil isolated from 
  <italic>Tetraclinis articulata</italic> (Vahl) leaves, Masters originating in Morocco (Benslimane Region, Atlantic-influenced plain). The analysis of the major compounds of essential oil was performed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, and this oil is dominated by bornyl acetate (35.05%), camphor (11.17%), and 
  <italic>α</italic>-pinene (10.84%). The antioxidant properties were evaluated by the test of the radical trap 2,2-diphényl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), and the antimicrobial activity of 
  <italic>T</italic>. 
  <italic>articulata</italic> essential oil was tested against clinical isolates of 
  <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
  <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, and 
  <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> which have been inhibited from the 25 
  <italic>μ</italic>g/mL.
