<p>The oil was extracted from the grinded seeds in 500 ml Soxhlet extraction for 24 hr using n‐hexane. The extract was filtered and transferred to a rotary evaporator (LabTech, Germany) to remove n‐hexane under vacuum at 40°C. The raw oil was cloudy yellow color and contained some suspected impurities, such as water, and coextracted compounds. Therefore, it was refined by a set of pretreatment processes. These processes included adding silica gel (5 g per 100 ml oil) to the oil to remove any coagulated and gummy compounds. The mixture (oil and silica gel) was stored at 4°C for 120 min and then centrifuged at 3,500 rpm for 5 min. The oil layer was poured into separatory funnel and washed with distilled water (5 ml water:100 ml oil) for 15 min. After that, the oil was heated to 105°C for 30 min to remove any water and residues. Finally, the oil was bubbled (dried) with a stream of N
 <sub>2</sub>‐gas (grad 5). The refined oil was then stored for physical, chemical, and biological analysis.
