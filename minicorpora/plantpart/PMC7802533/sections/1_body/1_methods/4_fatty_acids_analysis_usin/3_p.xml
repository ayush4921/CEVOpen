<p>The FAMEs composition was analyzed using GC‐MS and GC‐FID. GC‐MS analysis of Handal seed oil fatty acids was performed using a Trace 1,300 gas chromatography (GC) coupled to a TSQ 8,000 Triple Quadrupole mass spectrometer (ThermoScientific). Methylated fatty acids were separated using a BPX70 high resolution column (10 m × 0.1 mm ID × 0.2 μm) (Canadian Life Science, ON, Canada) using helium as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. A split mode (1:15) injection was applied with 1 μL volume injection of each sample using a Tri‐plus auto‐sampler (Thermo Scientific). The oven temperature program was set as follow: the initial oven temperature of 50°C (held for 0.75 min), then programmed to increase at 40°C/min to 155°C, then increased at 6°C/min to 210°C, and then increased at 15°C/min to 250°C (held for 2 min), total time: 17 min.</p>
