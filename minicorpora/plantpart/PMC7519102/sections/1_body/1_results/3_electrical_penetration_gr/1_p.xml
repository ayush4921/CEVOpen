<p id="Par10">Regarding the Electrical Penetration Graph (EPG) results, overall just few adults performed behaviors related to phloem and xylem activities (G NWEI: 2 adults in untreated, 2 in EO, 1 in pyrethrin, 0 in CT; E1 NWEI: 1 in untreated, 1 in EO, none in pyrethrin and CT; E2 NWEI: 1 in untreated, 1 in EO, none in pyrethrin and CT). Furthermore none of the monitored adults performed E1e and pd. OSW on plants treated with pyrethrin showed significantly lower number of probes than CT (z = 2.720, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.033), EO (z = 3.199, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.007), and untreated (z = − 2.972, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.015). We observed no significant difference among the treatments in np WDI. On the contrary, OSW on pyrethrin-treated plants showed significantly shorter C waveforms (C WDI) than EO (z = 3.006, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.014) and untreated (z = − 3.052, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.012), significantly shorter Total Probing Time than EO (z = 2.836, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.023) and untreated (z = − 2.937, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.017), and significantly longer time needed for the 1
 <sup>st</sup> probe than EO (z = − 3.424, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.003) and untreated (z = 3.371, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.004). There was no significant difference between pyrethrin and CT regarding the latter three EPG’s variables.
