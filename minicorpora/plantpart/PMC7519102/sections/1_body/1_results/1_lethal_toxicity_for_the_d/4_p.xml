<p id="Par7">Treatments significantly differed considering the number of nymphs emerged (and alive) from sprayed eggs (Kruskal–Wallis chi-squared = 30.474, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Pyrethrin caused the greatest reduction in the number of emerged and alive first instar nymphs compared to the other substances tested (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). Pyrethrin difference with the control was just close to the statistical significance (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.07); number of alive nymphs for the control was marginally significantly lower than azadirachtin (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.048), and similar to CT (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.40), EO (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.67), and mineral oil (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.40) (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>).
