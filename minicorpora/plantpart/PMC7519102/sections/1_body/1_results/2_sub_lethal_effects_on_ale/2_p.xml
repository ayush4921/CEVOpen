<p id="Par9">Treatments significantly differed also for their effect on oviposition, i.e. the total number of citrus plants on which OSW laid eggs (Kruskal–Wallis chi-squared = 20.796, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). The greatest number of plants with eggs was recorded for the untreated control, that did not differ from azadirachtin (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.504) and CT (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.103); the difference with mineral oil was just marginally non-significant (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.058). Oviposition was instead significantly impaired on plants sprayed with EO and pyrethrin (on the latter no oviposition occurred), with no difference among the two treatments (Table
