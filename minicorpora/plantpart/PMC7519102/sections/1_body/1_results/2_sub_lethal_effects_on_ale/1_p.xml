<p id="Par8">The organic compounds tested had significant effects on both the host searching/alighting behavior and the oviposition. We observed a significant difference in the number of adults alighting on the citrus plants among the treatments (Kruskal–Wallis chi-squared = 83.879, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Considering the pairwise comparisons, the greatest number of adults was observed for plants sprayed with mineral oil that significantly differed from the other treatments. Values for azadirachtin, CT and control were overall similar. Plants treated with EO and pyrethrin were the ones showing the lowest number of adults, with no difference between them (Table
