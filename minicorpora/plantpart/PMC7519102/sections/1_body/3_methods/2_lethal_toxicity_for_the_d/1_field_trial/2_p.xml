<p id="Par20">The insecticide treatments were carried out during the last week of July (field conditions: temperature 26 ± 6 °C; RH 61 ± 13%) and the second week of September (field conditions: 28.3 ± 5 °C; 58.8 + -14.5% RH) (thus, two separate replicates). During each date, 16 plants were sprayed with EO, 15 each with CT and the mineral oil, 12 with azadirachtin, and 13 each with pyrethrin and tap-water (the latter used as control). The sprayed plants were distributed following a completely randomized block design. The products were sprayed with a low-pressure knapsack sprayer (Ausonia 38018, 16L) until runoff.</p>
