<p id="Par19">Firstly, we evaluated the efficacy in terms of induced mortality of the five pesticides on OSW different instars in an experimental field located in the premises of the CIHEAM-Bari research institute (Apulia region, Southern Italy). The experimental field was composed by 84 two-year old sweet orange (
 <italic>Citrus sinensis</italic>) plants var. Valencia late, grafted on sour orange (
 <italic>Citrus aurantium</italic>) rootstock, planted on eight rows of ten plants each, plus a central row with four plants. At the moment of the trial, the plants had a height of approximately 1 m. The plants were fertilized monthly (Anticlor FE24, l.gobbi) and watered three times per week. The plants were naturally infested with OSW possibly dispersing from heavily infested lemon (
 <italic>Citrus limon</italic>), orange, and tangerine (
 <italic>Citrus reticulata</italic>) plants located ca. 30 m far from the experimental field (on the Eastern side). OSW fourth instar nymphs (pupal cases) were collected on the orange plants of the experimental field, prepared and slide-mounted according to Pizza and Porcelli
