<p id="Par24">We evaluated whether the compounds under screening affected OSW host searching behavior, together with settling and oviposition. Two to three-day-old adults emerging from the puparia on the grapevine plants (method described above for the trial on eggs) were used for the experiment. Twenty-four two-year old sweet orange var. Madame Vinous plants per replicate having the same vegetative conditions (40 cm height, ca. 12 leaves per plant) were treated with the six compounds under screening. Thereafter, the plants were caged inside four Bug Dorm cages, six plants per cage, each plant corresponding to a treatment. The cage was ideally divided into six squares (each square corresponds to a position), namely A, B, C, D, E, F (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>). We took note of the position of the plant inside the cage, thus of the square occupied by the plant/treatment; in each cage, we switched the position of each treatment, thus the square occupied by the treatment, in order to avoid position effects. Three hours after the treatment we introduced in each cage ten OSW adults (ratio male:female = 1:1). We took note of the position of the OSW adults inside the cage, i.e. the number of adults on each plant/treatment, one, three, 14, 24, 48 and 72 h upon the introduction. Following the last survey (72 h), the plants were checked for oviposition (number of plants with eggs). We carried out 15 replicates, thus a total of 60 plants per treatment.
