<p id="Par26">The recordings were carried out inside a Faraday cage, in an acclimatized room (23 ± 2 °C). Probing and feeding behavior was recorded for six hours with a Giga 8-DC EPG (EPG-systems, Wageningen, The Netherlands) at 1 Giga Ohm input resistance. Output from the EPG at 100 × gain was digitalized at a rate of 100 samples per sec. per channel, and recorded using Stylet+software (EPG-systems, Wageningen, The Netherlands;

Substrate voltage was adjusted following the calibration instructions of the DC EPG equipment so that EPG output signals fit into the + 5 V to − 5 V window provided by the software. EPG waveforms were interpreted according to Janssen et al

 </sup>. As variables needed to describe the effect of the treatments on OSW probing behavior we calculated: the total number of probes performed by the whitefly during the 6 h (n probes); the total duration of each of the waveforms np (non-probing), C (stylets pathway), G (xylem-feeding), pd (potential drop), E1e (extracellular salivation); E1 (phloem salivation); E2 (phloem ingestion) during the 6 h (WDI); the total number of each of the waveforms G, pd, E1e, E1, E2 performed during the 6 h (NWEI); the total time spent by OSW in probing activities during the 6 h (Total probing time); the time required by the whitefly to perform the first probe from the beginning of the rec (Time to the 1st probe).
