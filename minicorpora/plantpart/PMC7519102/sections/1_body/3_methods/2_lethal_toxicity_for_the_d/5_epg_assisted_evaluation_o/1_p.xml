 </sup>. We choose these three compounds according to the results gathered by the experiments described above (see discussion section for further details). The insects used for this trial were two to three day-old adults obtained from field infested grapevine plants (method explained above for trial on eggs). Upon collection, the adults were moved for 24 h to other BugDorms cages containing each six two-year old sweet orange plants var. Madame Vinous potted in 1L pots filled with garden soil, peat, and pumice, for acclimation before the EPG. The cages were kept into a climatic chamber under controlled conditions (27 °C, 70%HR, 16:8 L:D). For the EPG, females OSW were tethered according to the protocol by Moreno-Delafuente et al

 </sup>. Upon tethering, each adult was placed on the abaxial surface of an apical leaf of a sweet orange plant treated with one of the substances under screening; the plants were sprayed with a hand-handle sprayer until runoff three hours before the EPG recording, with the same doses used for the other experiments (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The plants used for the EPG were two-year old sweet oranges var. Madame Vinous (the same as the plants used for OSW rearing). We recorded the behavior of four adults OSW per time (thus four adults per recording), with each whitefly placed on a plant to which one of the four treatments was applied. Therefore, each EPG recording was carried out with the four treatments simultaneously (four plants, each plant corresponding to one of the three treatments plus control). The position of the plants/treatments was switched during the different recordings in order to avoid position effects. We carried out ten replicates (recordings) for each treatment.
