<p id="Par23">Finally, we assessed the effect of the tested compounds on eggs hatching, i.e. on the number of nymphs emerged/alive over the total number of eggs laid by OSW females before the treatment. Briefly, 60 one-year old sweet orange plants var. Madame Vinous were caged inside three cages (20 plants/cage) containing each 100 OSW adults reared under controlled conditions (males and females, ratio = 1:1) (whitefly rearing described below). The cages (Bug Dorm 2120) containing the plants and the adults were kept inside a growth chamber under controlled conditions (24 ± 2 °C, 60%RH, 14:8 L:D). Three days after the exposure to adult whiteflies, the plants were checked for presence and number of eggs by using an × 10 magnifying lens. Plants with eggs were treated with the tested compounds (and water for untreated control) with a hand-handle sprayer (Matabi IK, 1.5L) until runoff. The different treatments were kept separated, confined inside rectangular cages (1 × 1 m, metal frame, covered with aphid-net), one cage per treatment, and maintained in a growth chamber under controlled conditions (24 ± 2 °C, 60%RH, 14:10 L:D). The plants were daily screened for the emergence of the first instar nymphs for ten consecutive days. The experiment was replicated three times. For obtaining adults OSW to use in this trial, two year-old field infested grapevine potted plants var. Cabernet Sauvignon were caged inside Bug Dorm 2120 , six plants per cage. The cages were kept into a climatic chamber under controlled conditions (24 ± 2 °C, 60%RH, 14:10 L:D), and water-fertilized three times per week (Anticlor FE24, l.gobbi). Two to three day-old adults emerging from the puparia on the grapevine plants were used for the experiment (and for the experiments described below).</p>
