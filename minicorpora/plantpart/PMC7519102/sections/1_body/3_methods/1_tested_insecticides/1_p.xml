<p id="Par18">The products tested in our experiments were: (i) sweet orange (
 <italic>Citrus sinensis</italic> L.) essential oil (herein referred as EO); (ii) an extract of 
 <italic>Clitoria ternatea</italic> (herein referred as CT); (iii) mineral oil; (iv) pyrethrin; (v) azadirachtin (see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> for more details). Choice of these organic-pesticides was driven by previous reports of their efficacy against OSW, as in the case of EO

 </sup>, or their widespread use in organic agriculture, i.e. pyrethrin, azadirachtin and mineral oil (EU Regulation (EC) No 889/2008). For the tests we applied the maximum doses indicated in the productsâ€™ label. Plants treated with tap water were used as control.
