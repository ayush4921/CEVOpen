The effect of the compounds on adults’ emergence from puparia, eggs hatching , host searching behavior (number of adults on the plants), and oviposition (number of plants with eggs per treatment) was assessed by Kruskal–Wallis rank sum test, followed in case of significant differences by pairwise comparisons using Wilcoxon rank sum test.
