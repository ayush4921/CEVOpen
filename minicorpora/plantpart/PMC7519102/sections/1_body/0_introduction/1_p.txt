0: Biological invasions are a pervasive component of global change, challenging the conservation of biodiversity and natural resources 1  5.
1: Many introduced populations remain innocuous for extended periods before spreading and becoming invasive 6; by the time impacts are noted, irreversible ecosystem changes might have occurred 1,  7.
2: Species introduced into new environments with accidental or intentional human assistance represent a serious threat for native species, ecosystems and human well-being 8  12.
3: A good example is represented by invasive arthropod crop pests for which control farmers often overuse insecticides 13  15 with consequent side effects on non-target organisms 16 and human health 17.
