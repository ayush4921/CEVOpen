<p id="Par3">Among invasive insect pests, many whiteflies (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) species have become widely distributed due to anthropogenic activities, especially national and international trade, with dramatic consequences for agriculture, due to their ability to cause direct damages to the crop and to transmit plant viruses

 </sup>. Due to habitat fragmentation creating abundant and diverse niches, Italy is one of the most welcoming territories in Europe for foreign species, such as the Orange Spiny Whitefly (OSW) 
 <italic>Aleurocanthus spiniferus</italic> (Quaintance, 1903) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae). OSW, a whitefly species originating from China and South and Southeast Asia, was reported for the first time in 2008 in the EU territory in Southern Italy, Apulia Region
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>
 </sup>. Currently, OSW has been found in central and northern regions of Italy, beside other countries across the European Adriatic coast as Croatia, Montenegro and Greece
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>
 </sup>. OSW is currently included in the EPPO list (A2) as a quarantine pest threatening Europe. The main OSW host plants are 
 <italic>Citrus</italic> spp.: infested plants show a general weakening due to sap loss, and a severe reduction of photosynthesis and respiration activities caused by sooty mold developing on the abundant honeydew produced by the whitefly that completely covers the plant. Eventually, heavily infested trees have an almost completely black appearance, and the fruits are unmarketable
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>
 </sup>. Infestations of 
 <italic>Citrus</italic> spp. plants by the sibling species 
 <italic>Aleurocanthus woglumi</italic> (Ashby, 1915) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) have been reported to reduce fruit setting by ca. 80%
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>
 </sup>. In addition, the whitefly seems rapidly adapting to the European environment; indeed 
 <italic>A. spiniferus</italic> is creating new trophic associations with previously unreported host plants, such as grapevine, 
 <italic>Parthenocissus</italic> sp., 
 <italic>Ailanthus altissima</italic>, and other cultivated and ornamental plants
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>
 </sup>. However, such plants can be just transient hosts serving as shelter during periods when the main hosts, i.e. 
 <italic>Citrus</italic> spp. plants, become unsuitable/less suitable
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>
 </sup>. Beside the economic losses, the spread of OSW in Italy is considered as having serious environmental consequences. Indeed, the growers reacted to infestations with a massive use of synthetic wide-spectrum insecticides applied untimely and without technical criteria that, besides having proved ineffective, might have caused serious side effects on the environment and non-target arthropods, together with the possible development of resistant whitefly populations

 </sup>. As observed by Vieira et al
 <italic>.</italic>
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>
 </sup> for the congeneric species 
 <italic>A. woglumi</italic> in Brazil, the use of mineral oils, vegetable oils, or derivate, may result in improved control strategies for the pest with minimal adverse effects on populations of natural enemies and non-target species
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>
 </sup>. Indeed, low-impact organic certified pesticides could be integrated with augmentative biological control
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>
 </sup>, developing a sustainable strategy for the management of OSW. Such strategy, important in conventional agriculture to produce safe and sustainable products, would be crucial in organic farming, where relatively few pesticides are available and allowed (EU Regulation (EC) No 889/2008)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>
 </sup>. Furthermore, pesticides should be evaluated not just depending on short-term efficacy, but looking at direct and indirect effects possibly altering pest physiology and behavior, with consequences irradiating from the single individual exposed to the toxicant, to population and community-level
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>
 </sup>. Overall, the implementation of a sustainable and effective OSW control strategy applicable in organic 
 <italic>Citrus</italic> spp. farming, which represents an important part of the agricultural economy of the entire Mediterranean area
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>
 </sup>, is an urgent issue of paramount importance. Therefore, we tested the effects of different organic-certified pesticides on OSW, both in terms of lethal toxicity and of sublethal effects on insect’s behavior, i.e. on host searching, landing, oviposition, and probing and feeding behaviors.
