 </sup>; unfortunately, such knowledge on OSW in the Mediterranean agro-ecosystem is missing. Therefore, containing the threat posed by this insect to Mediterranean agriculture will require massive research efforts focused on: (1) filling the knowledge-gap on fundamental elements of the whitefly bionomics and landscape ecology; (2) searching for natural enemies to employ in conservation and augmentation programs, testing their efficacy in containing OSW population together with their susceptibility to the pesticides to be used in integrated control strategies.
