<p id="Par12">Mineral oil influenced the host searching behavior, with more OSW adults observed landing on plants treated with these compounds compared to other treatments and control. Even though more adults landed on mineral oil-sprayed plants, the total number of plants where oviposition occurred was lower than other treatments and control. However, impairment of oviposition was statistically significant just for EO and pyrethrin (the latter compound entirely impaired oviposition, with no plants with eggs).</p>
