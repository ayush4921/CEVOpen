<p id="Par15">Overall, our results highlight how pyrethrin (especially micro- and nano-encapsulated formulations), CT, and EO, if timely applied, could be successfully employed for OSW integrated control strategies. Indeed, even if induced mortality seems not particularly relevant, they could interfere with pestâ€™s perception of plant cues necessary for host selection, settling and feeding

 </sup>. However, it is worth mentioning that our results on OSW mortality rate refer to single exposures of the insects to the products tested; therefore, we consider important to assess the efficacy of repeated treatments with the tested products in a relatively short time-span, through field trials that might furnish essential technical indications to farmers and stake-holders. Additionally, results we obtained in free-choice tests could have been influenced by the presence within the same cage of all the products (each plant was treated with one product), thus with a co-existence of different scents that could have affected OSW adults orientation. Although our design is closer to a field situation where different scents co-exist within the same environment, final evidences on repellent/attractive properties of each compound alone should be assessed with further experiments.
