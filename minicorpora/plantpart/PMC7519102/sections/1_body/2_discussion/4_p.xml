<p id="Par14">Pyrethrin resulted to be the most promising organic-certified compound for the control of OSW. Pyrethrin was highly effective in reducing nymphs’ emergence from eggs when plants with eggs were treated with the compounds under screening, although no significant first instar nymphs mortality was observed in field. Consistently with Campolo et al

 </sup>, we believe the observed phenomenon is not the result of an effect of pyrethrin on eggs, since the structure of the eggs protects the developing embryos and may interfere with insecticide penetration

 </sup>. Instead, pyrethrin could have directly acted on the nymphs upon emergence, through either lethal toxicity (not consistent with our field result) or feeding-deterrent effect (consistent with our EPG data), similarly to what we observed with adults. Indeed, according to our EPG results, pyrethrin strongly repelled adults, that barely attempted to probe the plant and, when occurring, for a very short time. In our test with pyrethrin treatment on plants with eggs, the plants were stored upon treatment inside a growth chamber, thus with no direct exposure to sun light. This could have exponentially increased pyrethrin persistency that is limited under field conditions due to compound’s photo-instability

 </sup>. Persistency issue could be fixed with pyrethrin’s micro- or nano-encapsulation, with an overall reduction of oxidation, hydrolysis and other degradations
