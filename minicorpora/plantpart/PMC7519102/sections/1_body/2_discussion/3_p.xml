<p id="Par13">CT (the extract of 
 <italic>Clitoria ternatea</italic>) significantly affected OSW probing behavior, reducing the time spent by the whitefly in probing activities. We decided to include in the EPG design only CT excluding mineral oil, in order to simplify the experimental design, and given CT has been proposed as alternative for the gradual phase-out of mineral oil in organic agriculture., Indeed, given their nature and their controversial and still unclear effects on environment and non-target organisms, mineral oils should be considered as contentious input particularly in organic agriculture, and their at least partial replacement with other substances is desirable

 </sup>. During the experiments, we noticed that upon the treated plants, CT created a surfactant layer coating the tissues, similarly to mineral oil. This layer could have impaired OSW host-searching/recognition, namely those actions/behaviors performed by the insect to recognize the host-plant, including probing

 </sup>. At the same time, the negative impact on feeding could have been related to the high concentration of cyclotides presents in 
 <italic>C. ternatea</italic> extract, that were demonstrated to affect larval growth of 
 <italic>Helicoverpa armigera</italic> (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in a dose-dependent manner when administered through diet

 </sup>. Therefore, timely application of CT could impair probing and feeding and settling, overall reducing OSW population levels. Sweet orange essential oil (EO) did not show the insecticidal effect on OSW reported by Guario et al

 </sup>; however, the reduced number of adults landing on the treated plants and the impairment of oviposition, possibly associated to the synergistic action of limonene with other compounds, are consistent with the EO repellent effect reported for other insects

 </sup> for polygodial on aphids; however, the same authors reported changes in probing behavior following longer exposure to polygodial, a sub-lethal effect that deserve to be invested for EO too, given previous observations on essential oils inhibitory activity of acetylcholinesterase
