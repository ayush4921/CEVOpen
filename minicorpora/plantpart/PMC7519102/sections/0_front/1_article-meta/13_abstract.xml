 <p id="Par1">The Orange Spiny Whitefly (OSW) 
  <italic>Aleurocanthus spiniferus</italic> (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) represents a new serious threat to 
  <italic>Citrus</italic> spp., grapevine and ornamental plants in the whole Mediterranean area. Such threat urgently calls for the development of a sustainable control strategy, including insecticides compatible with biological control, and applicable also in organic citrus farming that represent an essential part of Mediterranean agricultural economy. Therefore, we evaluated the toxicity and the effects on host searching, oviposition, and probing and feeding behavior exerted on OSW by organic insecticides supposed to have limited side effects on environment and ecosystem services, i.e. sweet orange essential oil (EO), extract of 
  <italic>Clitoria ternatea</italic> (CT), mineral oil, pyrethrin and azadirachtin. Despite none of the compounds caused a significant mortality of any of the OSW instars, we observed interesting effects on whitefly behavior: (i) EO and pyrethrin showed a relevant repellent effect, with impairment of both adults landing and oviposition on treated plants; (ii) CT and pyrethrin strongly affected probing behavior. Here, in the light of our findings, we discuss possible OSW sustainable control strategies and further research perspectives.
