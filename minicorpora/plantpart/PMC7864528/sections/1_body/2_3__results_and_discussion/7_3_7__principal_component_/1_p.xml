 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-00332-f012">Figure 12</xref>. According to the results obtained by PCA, one group consisting of control, Tr0.5, Tr1, Tr3 and control 0.3g, Tr0.5k0.3g, Tr1k0.3g, Tr3k0.3g can be seen. PCA also emphasized that the addition of orange essential oil, Tween 80 and Tween 20 had an impact on UV-Vis properties of prepared films. Another finding was that the addition of Tween 20 and Tween 80 did not affect the film matrix.
