<p>SEM analysis is commonly used for the description of packaging surfaces, describing their homogeneity and integrity [

It can be seen that the control samples with both contents of carrageenan (samples c and 0.3g c) show smooth homogeneous surfaces indicating an effective plasticization of the carrageenan by glycerol. Among the other compositions of the films, it can be seen that the films with the lower content of carrageenan (0.3 g) in general maintain the integrity and homogeneity of the surface even after the addition of other components, while films with the higher content of carrageenan (0.5 g) are more prone to a surface heterogeneity. At this content of carrageenan, a moderate presence of separated agglomerates and/or crystals on the surface of the films was found for the OT80, and a significant surface heterogeneity was determined in all samples that contained a combination of essential oil and trehalose. At the same time, from the comparison of the topography of the essential oil-containing films, it is obvious that the use of Tween 20 as the emulsifier results in less heterogeneous topography.
