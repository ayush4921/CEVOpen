<p>Furthermore, it can be seen that the extent of surface heterogeneity is inversely proportional to the film transparency, which confirms that the number and size of the heterogeneities (crystals, agglomerates) affect the amount of light scattered during the passage through a film. Therefore, from the perspective of integrity and homogeneity of the films, and the resulting optical properties, preparation of the films with the lower content of carrageenan seems to be more appropriate.</p>
