<p>For the films with the lower content of carrageenan (0.3 g), the presence of the essential oil exhibited a less pronounced impact on the trehalose crystallinity (see 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-polymers-13-00332">Figures S5 and S6 in the Supplementary Materials</xref>). Except for sample 0.3gTr3OT20, trehalose in the films with the presence of the essential shows predominantly spectral signs of the amorphous form. On the other hand, higher contents of trehalose in the films without OEO bring about higher signs of the dihydrate presence as compared to corresponding films prepared from the higher content of carrageenan. It is likely that while in the case of 0.5g carrageenan films, the trehalose dihydrate crystals excluded on the surface of the films are the main contributors to the collected spectra, in the case of smooth homogeneous films prepared from 0.3 g carrageenan, the FTIR spectra better represent the true distribution of trehalose conformers inside the film matrix.
