<p>While the trehalose signature in spectra shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-00332-f007">Figure 7</xref> is limited to several bands (the most important ones are marked in the figure), significantly more peaks appear in the spectra shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-00332-f008">Figure 8</xref> as a result of the trehalose presence. Comparing the following spectral features with the literature [
 <xref rid="B46-polymers-13-00332" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], we suggest that the spectral signature of agarose shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-00332-f007">Figure 7</xref> may be attributed to the prevailing content of amorphous trehalose, while that presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-00332-f008">Figure 8</xref> corresponds to the majority of crystalline trehalose dihydrate: (a) In the samples without essential oil, the most intensive vibration band occurs at 984 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, while the band is red-shifted to about 992 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> for the films with essential oil. (b) Symmetric stretching vibration of the glycosidic bond at 955 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> occurs specifically in spectra of the dihydrated crystalline form. (c) Water molecules trapped in the crystalline dihydrate exhibit specific stretching (around 3500 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>) and bending (around 1680 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>) frequencies. For the essential oil-containing films with the same concentration of carrageenan but with Tween 20 as the surfactant, similar qualitative signs of the presence of trehalose dihydrate were found (see 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-polymers-13-00332">Figure S3 in the Supplementary Materials</xref>). Altogether, these results indicate that trehalose in the films with the higher content of carrageenan is less compatible with the film matrix (i.e., less content of trehalose is dispersed in the film in amorphous form) when the surfactant and the essential oil is added. This also suggests that the surface heterogeneity for the essential oil-containing films as revealed by SEM is caused by crystals of trehalose dihydrate excluded from the film matrix.
