<p>The main vibration bands ascribed to a trehalose presence are those corresponding to C–O–C stretching of the glycosidic bond. These bands occur in the range 900–1200 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> depending on the symmetry of the molecule. Therefore, the FTIR pattern of trehalose in this spectral region can be used as a marker of the trehalose conformation [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-00332-f007">Figure 7</xref> shows FTIR spectra of the trehalose-containing films with a higher content of carrageenan (0.5 g) and with the absence of essential oil, while 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-00332-f008">Figure 8</xref> shows spectra of the films also containing essential oil and emulsifier (Tween 80). The difference between the trehalose manifestation in both spectra is obvious.
