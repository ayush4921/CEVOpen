<p>To provide a semi-quantitative evaluation of the relative content of individual trehalose forms from the collected FTIR spectra, we calculated two spectral parameters which should positively correlate with the content of trehalose dihydrate—the absorbance ratio at 955 (trehalose dihydrate) and 843 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (carrageenan) and the frequency of the antisymmetric stretching of the glycosidic bond. The results are shown in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-00332-f010">Figure 10</xref>. It can be seen that both parameters confirm two main conclusions of the qualitative evaluation of the FTIR spectra, i.e., that in the case of 0.5 g carrageenan films, the presence of essential oil and emulsifier induces exclusion of trehalose dihydrate crystals on the film surface, while the 0.3 g carrageenan films, in general, show higher compatibility of trehalose with the film matrix, hence reducing the relative content of crystalline trehalose dihydrate. The presence of both forms of trehalose can be considered advantageous from different points of view. Maintaining trehalose in the amorphous form dispersed inside the film matrix will prevent the exclusion of crystals and the loss of film transparency (see above). Moreover, the higher solubility of amorphous trehalose increases its release rates from the films as compared to the release of a crystalline form. Last but not least, exothermic heat of the dissolution of amorphous trehalose, conversely to the endothermic dissolution of trehalose dihydrate, has been considered interesting for the production of foodstuffs and medicaments with a warming effect in the mouth [

In the “open” conformation that occurs in the dihydrate form but not in the trehalose glass (amorphous solid trehalose), all the hydroxygroups in trehalose participate in hydrogen-bonding, which enables them to mimic an aqueous environment in dehydrated biological materials [
