<p>FTIR analysis was also involved in the study to provide a deeper view into the chemical structure of the prepared films. The attenuated total reflectance (ATR) technique was used to focus the analysis primarily on the surface of the prepared films. FTIR spectra of the films prepared with the absence of trehalose are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-00332-f006">Figure 6</xref>. It can be seen that the presence of the main structural components is reflected in the measured spectra. The spectrum of the control sample (sample c) combines characteristic vibrations of the main film-forming component (carrageenan) and the plasticizer (glycerol). The wide absorption band centered at 3300–3400 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> is attributed to stretching vibration of O–H bonds which are found in both the film components as well as in the residual moisture contained in the film. The presence of the free water molecules (i.e., those not bound in the form of a crystalline hydrate) is further confirmed by an absorption band at 1640 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (water molecule bending) and by a characteristic baseline deformation at the lowest measured frequencies. Aside from the contribution to –OH stretching above 3000 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, other characteristic vibrations of carrageenan can easily be recognized over the whole analyzed spectral range (the specific vibrations that were assigned according to the literature [
 <xref rid="B44-polymers-13-00332" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] are marked with an asterisk in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-00332-f006">Figure 6</xref>). First, asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of C–H bonds in carrageenan methylene groups are located at 2940 and 2890 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. Second, the characteristic vibration pattern of oxygen-containing groups in carrageenan can be found in the region from 900 to 1200 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, namely, at 920 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (C–O stretching in 3,6-anhydro-
 <sc>d</sc>-galactose), 1035 and 1063 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (C–O and C–OH modes and glycosidic linkage) and 1159 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (C–O–C asymmetric stretching). Sulfate-associated vibrations of carrageenan can also be recognized in the spectrum mainly at 843 (
 <sc>d</sc>-galactose-4-sulphate), 1225 (sulfate ester asymmetric stretching) and 1375 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (sulfate stretching). Finally, skeleton bending of pyranose is manifested by the specific fingerprint pattern with the sharp peaks at 700, 733 and 772 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. Unlike the well-distinguished spectral features of carrageenan, characteristic C–C and C–O vibration bands of glycerol, normally occurring in the range 850–1100 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, are not easily identified in the spectra as they are overlapped by the carrageenan signal even at its lower content in the film (see the indifferent spectra of samples c and 0.3g c in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-00332-f006">Figure 6</xref>).
