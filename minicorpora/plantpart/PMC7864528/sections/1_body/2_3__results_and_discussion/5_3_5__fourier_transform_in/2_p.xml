<p>As expected, FTIR spectra of the films containing the essential oil are well-distinguished from the spectra of the corresponding control samples (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-00332-f006">Figure 6</xref>). Nevertheless, the main differences between the spectra with and without the essential oil, respectively, can be assigned to the presence of emulsifier (Tween 80 and Tween 20, respectively). First, higher intensity of C–H stretching in the range from 2800 to 3000 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> can be attributed to the hydrocarbon chains in the surfactants, whereby the peak frequencies of the asymmetric and symmetric vibrations are slightly red-shifted as compared to the controlled sample (to 2920 and 2860 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>). Furthermore, the spectral region that corresponds to the vibrations of oxygen-containing groups is also significantly altered. Carbonyl stretching in the ester group is manifested by the sharp peak at 1736 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, while the presence of ether linkages increases the absorption at 1065 and 1089 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, and the –OH bending intensity increases the absorption at 1455 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. Furthermore, C-H bending in CH
 <sub>2</sub> and CH
 <sub>3</sub> is manifested by absorptions at 1349 and 1248 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. Both the ether and the methylene moieties appear also in the structure of essential oils; therefore, it is likely that the essential oil incorporated in the films contributes to some of the spectral features assigned to the presence of emulsifier. In general, no significant spectral differences were found between the films prepared with the use of different emulsifiers (Tween 80 and Tween 20, respectively). Among the spectral features related to the presence of the C=C bond in the Tween 80, only the very weak C-H stretching vibration (at 3010 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>) can be observed in a spectrum of 0.3gOT80 (marked with arrow ion 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-00332-f007">Figure 7</xref>), while it is overlapped with the wide and intense –OH stretching band for the sample with a higher content of carrageenan (OT80).
