<p>The most interesting IR spectral features were revealed for the films containing trehalose. It is well known that trehalose exhibits polymorphism, i.e., depending on the thermodynamic conditions, it can adopt different crystalline forms aside from the form of amorphous solid [
 <xref rid="B45-polymers-13-00332" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], whereby each of the adopted forms exhibits specific spectral features in FTIR [
 <xref rid="B46-polymers-13-00332" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The actual adopted form of trehalose is crucial from the perspective of its performance as an active ingredient of the edible films, because it will affect such essential physicochemical parameters as the rate and heat of dissolution in water [
 <xref rid="B47-polymers-13-00332" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Furthermore, it has also been suggested that different crystalline forms may differently contribute to the bioprotective function of trehalose [
