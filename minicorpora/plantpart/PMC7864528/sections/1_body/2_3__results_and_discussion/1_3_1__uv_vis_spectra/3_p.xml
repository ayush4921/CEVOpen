<p>The UV-Vis spectra of samples with 0.5 g of Îº-carrageenan were shifted to the higher values of absorbance when the essential oil, trehalose and Tween 80 or Tween 20 were added. The lowest absorbance was found in the control sample; this finding is in accordance with the previous experiment [
 <xref rid="B26-polymers-13-00332" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. When only essential oil with emulsifier Tween 20 was added, the absorbance increased in the UV region, but not in the visible region. On the other hand, when Tween 80 was added, the absorbance increased in UV as well as in the VIS region. The combination of essential oil with trehalose resulted in higher absorbance (positive correlation with trehalose). The highest results of absorbance were found in the samples Tr3OT80 and Tr3OT20 (the samples with the highest concentration of trehalose: 3%). In the previous research conducted by Liu et al. [
