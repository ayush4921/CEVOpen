<p>The figures show absorbance spectra in the spectral range from 356 to 600 nm; bellow 356 nm, the absorbance value exceeded the sensitivity limit of the spectrophotometer as it was rising above three. Based on this high absorbance in the UV region, the films have good potential barrier properties against UV radiation [
