<p>The results of UV-Vis spectroscopy analysis are shown in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-00332-f002">Figure 2</xref> (for film samples with 0.3 g of κ-carrageenan). In general, requirements of the spectral properties of packaging materials in UV-VIS regions are rather complex and often contradictory. On the one hand, low transmittance of UV radiation is highly regarded as far as it increases the lifespan of the packaged foodstuff. High transparency of the packaging is required in the visible region since it provides a consumer with a visual control of the commodity’s condition.
