 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-00332-f002">Figure 2</xref>, the lowest UV-VIS spectra were found for 0.3gc (the line hidden behind the line for 0.3gTr0.5 and 0.3gTr1). The samples without the addition of orange essential oil had the lowest absorbance. The addition of orange essential oil increased the absorbance, and the combination with orange essential oil and trehalose resulted in the highest absorbance (0.3gTr3OT20 and 0.3gTr3OT80). A higher absorbance of films with OEO can be caused by the presence of lipid droplets in films that have a different refractive index, inducing light scattering [

The study emphasized that the combination of OEO and trehalose multiplies protection against UV radiation, meaning that there is a synergistic effect between these two substances. The combination of oil and sugar added to the matrix of edible film causes the formation of oil droplets; the increasing concentration of sugar causes less breaking of forming droplets, and oil droplets occur in a larger size [
