<p>Transparency value can be compared to the real appearance of prepared films in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-00332-f003">Figure 3</xref>. From the data and pictures in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-00332-f003">Figure 3</xref>, respectively, it is apparent that the addition of orange essential oil highly affected the transparency of films, but it has to be stressed, subjectively, in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-00332-f003">Figure 3</xref> that the films were less transparent with higher concentrations of trehalose. Nevertheless, the combination of trehalose and orange essential oil affected the transparency too, the same as the addition of orange essential oil without trehalose. Å uput et al. [

 <xref rid="B41-polymers-13-00332" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] studied the addition of different essential oils in starch and carrageenan films, and found similar results to those that can be caused by the presence of phenolic compounds in essential oils, which might absorb light at low wavelengths. In our research, the combination of trehalose and OEO had a statistically significant impact (
