<p>The UV barrier properties are very important for the food packaging industry; common examples are oxidation of lipids and discoloration of food [

 <xref rid="B3-polymers-13-00332" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The most affected are unsaturated fatty acids and their esters; the products of photooxidation are hydroperoxides. Hydroperoxides can decompose and produce radicals that induce oxidation of other fatty acids [

 <xref rid="B33-polymers-13-00332" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Vitamin A and β-carotene are the most affected by wavelengths below 465 nm. β-carotene is more reactive to oxidation than vitamin A acetate; this is explained by the presence of six extra double bonds, in the β-carotene structure [

 <xref rid="B35-polymers-13-00332" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] also confirmed a decrease in transmittance with the addition of essential oil. Again, the combination of trehalose and OEO provides the best transmittance results.
