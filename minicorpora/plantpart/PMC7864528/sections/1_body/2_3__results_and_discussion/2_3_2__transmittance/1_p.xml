 <xref rid="polymers-13-00332-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. It has to be stressed that when the Tween 80 or Tween 20 and orange essential oil were added, the transmittance in the UV region at 356 nm rapidly decreased; the same happened at 600 nm. Haghighi et al. [
 <xref rid="B29-polymers-13-00332" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] found similar results when the combination of polymer and essential oils was studied. In our samples, the lowest transmittance as well as the best UV barrier properties were found in samples with the addition of 3% trehalose and orange essential oil. The addition of higher amounts of trehalose resulted in a transmittance decrease. Statistically significant differences (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) were not found between all samples with the addition of essential oil in T356. However, statistically significant differences (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) were found between samples without orange essential oil and with essential oil, so the addition of orange essential oil and Tween 80 or Tween 20 had a higher impact on the transmittance of prepared films. The transmittance, the same as absorbance, was affected by the presence of oil droplets in edible films [

 <xref rid="B28-polymers-13-00332" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The addition of trehalose also had an impact; statistically significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) differences were found between c, Tr0.5 and Tr1. Sample Tr3 was statistically similar to Tr0.5 and Tr1. Hence, it seems that the effect of trehalose on the transmittance properties of the films is plateau-like, i.e., increasing the concentration of trehalose above a certain limit does not result in a further improvement of the optical properties. Transmittance at 600 nm for samples with 0.5 g of κ-carrageenan was affected by the addition of essential oil, where c showed a statistically significant difference (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in comparison with OT80 and OT20, but the more pronounced decline in transmittance at 600 nm was found in samples with a combination of trehalose and essential oil. The transmittance of the control sample was the highest, meaning that κ-carrageenan does not possess the same large barrier properties in the UV region as in the Vis region [
 <xref rid="B30-polymers-13-00332" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. This is caused by the presence of terpenes in essential oils, since they work as UV protectors [
