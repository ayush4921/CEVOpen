<p>The plates with edible films and bacteria after 18 h incubation were photographed and evaluated with respect to the evaluation scale mentioned earlier. The results are shown in 
 <xref rid="polymers-13-00332-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. The 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-13-00332-f011">Figure 11</xref> describes one of the plates in more detail, explaining the evaluation. Clearly, in samples 7, 7C and 8, the bacteria have overgrown the edible film and the blue background is barely visible, and thus, these samples were evaluated as value 5, 3 and 4, respectively. On the other hand, the blue background is visible in samples 8C, 13 and 14, indicating no bacterial growth at all (value is 1 for all). The complete results are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-polymers-13-00332">Figure S7</xref>.
