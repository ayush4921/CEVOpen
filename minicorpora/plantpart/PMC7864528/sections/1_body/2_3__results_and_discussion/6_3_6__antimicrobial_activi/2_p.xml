<p>Based on the previous results, we divided the prepared edible films into three groups. The first group consisted of samples with the addition of 0.5 g of κ-carrageenan, and these samples were resistant to all three tested microorganisms. The second group consisted of films with the addition of 0.3 g κ-carrageenan and without trehalose, which were, similarly to the previous group, resistant to all three tested microorganisms. The third group consisted of films with the addition of 0.3 g κ-carrageenan and trehalose, and these samples were not resistant to
