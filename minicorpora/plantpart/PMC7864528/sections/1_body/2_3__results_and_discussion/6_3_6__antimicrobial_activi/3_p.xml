<p>Most prepared edible films were resistant to 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>aureus</italic> (MRSA), except for 0.3gTr3OT80. Generally, for the edible film to be active against Gram-negative bacteria (
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> CCM 3954) and the yeast 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> CCM 8261, the necessary amount of κ-carrageenan was 0.5 g, with an exception for sample Tr3. The edible film prepared from 0.3 g of κ-carrageenan showed antimicrobial activity by itself or in combination with OEO and Tween 80. For activity against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, combinations 0.3gOT20, 0.3gTr0.5, 0.3gTr3 and 0.3g κ 0.3gTr0.5OT80 were also critical. The results showed that with an increasing amount of trehalose in films, neither 0.3 g of κ-carrageenan nor OEO were able to inhibit growth of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> or 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Thus, we suggest that trehalose serves as a nutrient in these cases [
