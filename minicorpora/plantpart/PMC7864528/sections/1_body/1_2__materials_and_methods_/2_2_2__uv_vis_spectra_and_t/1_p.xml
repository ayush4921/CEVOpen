<p>The UV-Vis spectra were recorded by a spectrophotometer CE7210 (DIET-QUEST, Cambridge, UK) at wavelengths from 200 to 600 nm. The transmittance values (%) were calculated at wavelengths 356 and 600 nm. The transparency values were then calculated according to Han and Floros [
 <xref rid="B23-polymers-13-00332" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] as follows:
 <disp-formula>Transparency value = logT
  <sub>600</sub>/x
  <label>(1)</label>
 </disp-formula> where T
 <sub>600</sub> is the transmittance (%) at 600 nm and x is the thickness of film samples (mm).
