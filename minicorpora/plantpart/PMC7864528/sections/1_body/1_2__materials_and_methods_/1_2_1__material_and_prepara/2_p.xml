<p>Films were prepared by aqueous solution casting method as follows: The respective weight of carrageenan (0.5 or 0.3 g) was dispersed in 43.65 mL of distilled water. A corresponding amount of trehalose was added together with carrageenan to set the final concentration of trehalose in solution at 0%, 0.5%, 1% and 3% (

 <italic>v</italic>), respectively. The complete dissolution was assured via mixing the dispersion on a magnetic stirrer (50 °C, 350 rpm) for 10 min. For the samples containing essential oil, 0.45 mL of orange essential oil was added in the next step and a homogeneous emulsion was achieved by another 5 min of stirring (50 °C, 350 rpm). In the resultant dispersion, 0.25 mL of glycerol was dissolved and, in the case of emulsions containing OEO, 1.3 mL of Tween 20 or Tween 80, was added 5 min after the glycerol addition, and the final mixture was stirred for 7 more minutes at 850 rpm. The films were prepared by casting the final dispersion on the Petri dishes with a diameter of 9 cm, and the films were dried for 24 h. The tested compositions of the edible films are described in
