<p>The solid medium according to Mueller and Hinton (MUELLER-HINTON broth, Agar for microbiology, Sigma-Aldrich) was used for culturing 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>aureus</italic> CCM 7110 and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> CCM 3954 with edible coatings, and solid medium Malt (Malt Extract Broth, Agar for microbiology, Sigma-Aldrich) was used for culturing of 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> CCM 8261 with edible coatings. The inoculum concentration was adjusted to approximately 1–2 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/mL, corresponding to 0.5 degrees of McFarland turbidity standard. An amount of 1 mL of inoculum was spread on the surface of the agar and, after drying, 6 cut-off discs from edible packaging material were placed on the agar. The inoculated plates were incubated for 18 h at 35–37 °C. The evaluation of antimicrobial activity was made by observation with the naked eye. To describe the results, we developed an evaluation scale from 1 to 5 (1 = disc completely clean, 5 = disc completely overgrown). According to the value, the result designated in Table 4 is either “antimicrobial activity” (+; values 1 and 2) or “no activity” (-; values 3, 4 and 5).
