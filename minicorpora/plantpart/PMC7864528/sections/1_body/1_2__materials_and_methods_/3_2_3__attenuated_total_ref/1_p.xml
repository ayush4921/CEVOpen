<p>Fourier transform infrared spectra of the prepared films were measured with an iS50 Fourier-Transform spectrometer (FTIR) (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). All measurements were taken from a surface of a film at ambient temperature (in an air-conditioned room) with the built-in single-reflection diamond attenuated total reflectance (ATR) crystal. An individual absorption spectrum was collected as an average of 16 scans with a resolution of 4 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (data spacing 0.5 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>). Each film was analyzed at 5 randomly distributed spots on its surface; FTIR spectra provided in respective figures in this paper represent an average of all the spectra collected for an individual sample.
