<p>The addition of essential oils in edible matrices was studied in some previous research, but in many of them, the main characteristics were physical, mechanical properties and antimicrobial activity [

 <xref rid="B21-polymers-13-00332" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-polymers-13-00332" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Only in a few of them the UV-Vis properties were studied. The importance of UV-Vis properties can be seen through the fact that these properties explain the capability of biodegradable packaging to protect food against radiation that can lead to food spoilage [
