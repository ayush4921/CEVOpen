0: The main functions of food packaging are protection against the outer environment, dust, microorganisms, pests and radiation too [ 1].
1: For example, UV radiation can cause the oxidation of lipid compounds, but there can also be an issue with the discoloration of food that makes food products less attractive for consumers [ 2, 3].
2: Many different compounds can be used to improve these films properties: tannic acid with modified microfibrillated cellulose films has UV blocking ability [ 4], and the addition of zein nanoparticles and olive oil in the starchglycerol matrix decreases transmittance and improves the UV barrier [ 5].
3: The important advantage of edible packaging is that it is produced from natural materials, and accordingly, it can help to reduce synthetic waste.
4: Additionally, edible packaging can be also consumed together with the packaged/wrapped foodstuff [ 6].
