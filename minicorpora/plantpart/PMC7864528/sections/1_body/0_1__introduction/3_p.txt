0: Essential oils are also proposed as promising additives for food packaging because they represent a well-functioning nature-based alternative to synthetic antioxidant compounds such as BHA (butylhydroxyanisole) or BHT (butylhydroxytoluene).
1: Nevertheless, the direct use of essential oils in foodstuffs is limited because the concentration of active compounds in them is very high.
2: The intense aroma of essential oils, noticeable even at very low concentrations, can affect sensory properties negatively [ 12].
3: Moreover, the inherent antimicrobial activity of essential oils is partially reduced in vitro since the compounds interact with food matrices and decrease antimicrobial activity.
4: However, the use of essential oils in food packaging can be highly recommended because it can work as the active packaging; some compounds can gradually migrate to foodstuff and improve their properties (shelf life, etc.).
5: Certainly, the release rate is affected by the package material structure and composition.
6: The compounds from essential oils incorporated into edible packaging can slowly be released into the food [ 13, 14, 15].
7: As with trehalose, orange essential oil possesses UV protective properties too [ 16].
8: Orange essential oil is produced from fruits of  Citrus aurantium L., Rutaceae containing mainly D-limonene and myrcene [ 17].
