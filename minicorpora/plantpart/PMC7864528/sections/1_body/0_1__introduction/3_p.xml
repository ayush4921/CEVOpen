<p>Essential oils are also proposed as promising additives for food packaging because they represent a well-functioning nature-based alternative to synthetic antioxidant compounds such as BHA (butylhydroxyanisole) or BHT (butylhydroxytoluene). Nevertheless, the direct use of essential oils in foodstuffs is limited because the concentration of active compounds in them is very high. The intense aroma of essential oils, noticeable even at very low concentrations, can affect sensory properties negatively [

Moreover, the inherent antimicrobial activity of essential oils is partially reduced in vitro since the compounds interact with food matrices and decrease antimicrobial activity. However, the use of essential oils in food packaging can be highly recommended because it can work as the active packaging; some compounds can gradually migrate to foodstuff and improve their properties (shelf life, etc.). Certainly, the release rate is affected by the package material structure and composition. The compounds from essential oils incorporated into edible packaging can slowly be released into the food [
