<p>The research showed that the combination of trehalose with orange essential oil had a great impact on barrier protection against UV-VIS radiation; the protection was significantly higher than using orange essential oil (OEO) or trehalose alone. A synergistic effect was found between these two substances and potentially the usage of films for food packaging as protectants and improvers of shelf life and food quality. The most protective UV properties were found for samples with the highest concentrations of trehalose and essential oils (since the lowest transmittance values at 356 nm were observed). Furthermore, it was found that experimentally produced packaging showed the greatest antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic>Staphyloccocus aureus</italic>. The highest antimicrobial activity against all studied microorganisms was shown by the edible films with the higher addition of carrageenan (0.5 g) in the film matrix. Using FTIR and SEM analysis, it was found that trehalose formation is dependent on the amount of carrageenan, the presence of orange essential oil and Tween addition. The compatibility of trehalose in the film matrix was better in the films with 0.3 g of carrageenan than with 0.5 g of carrageenan. The obtained results represent the knowledge improvement in properties of edible packaging prepared with trehalose, orange essential oil and carrageenan. Certainly, the findings are valuable for further research and possible application of edible packaging.
