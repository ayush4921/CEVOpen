 <p>The research aim was to use orange essential oil and trehalose in a carrageenan matrix to form edible packaging. The edible packaging experimentally produced by casting from an aqueous solution were evaluated by the following analysis: UV-Vis spectrum, transparency value, transmittance, attenuated total reflectance Fourier-Transform spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and antimicrobial activity. The obtained results showed that the combination of orange essential oil with trehalose decreases the transmittance value in the UV and Vis regions (up to 0.14% Â± 0.02% at 356 nm), meaning that produced films can act as a UV protector. Most produced films in the research were resistant to Gram-positive bacteria (
  <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> subsp. 
  <italic>aureus</italic>), though most films did not show antibacterial properties against Gram-negative bacteria and yeasts. FTIR and SEM confirmed that both the amount of carrageenan used and the combination with orange essential oil influenced the compatibility of trehalose with the film matrix. The research showed how different combinations of trehalose, orange essential oils and carrageenan can affect edible film properties. These changes represent important information for further research and the possible practical application of these edible matrices.
