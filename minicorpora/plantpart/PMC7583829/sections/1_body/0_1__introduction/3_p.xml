<p>Non-native invasive plant species are generally detrimental to the local environments where they have been introduced. They can outcompete native plant species and reduce biodiversity [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-25-04576" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], they can alter ecosystem functions [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-25-04576" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and can have substantial economic impacts [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-25-04576" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Control methods for invasive plants have generally included application of herbicides, physical cutting, or burning [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-25-04576" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, harvesting invasive species for beneficial uses as a method for control of invasive species may provide economic incentives to offset eradication costs [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-25-04576" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. For example, 
 <italic>Melaleuca quinquinervia</italic> trees in south Florida have been cut and chipped for landscape mulch and boiler fuel [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-25-04576" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]; it has been suggested that mechanical harvesting of invasive cattail (
 <italic>Typha</italic> spp.), common reed (
 <italic>Phragmites australis</italic>), and reed canary grass (
 <italic>Phalaris arundinacea</italic>) from coastal wetlands of Lake Ontario can be used as an agricultural nutrient source or as a biofuel [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-25-04576" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The leaf essential oil of 
 <italic>Solidago canadensis</italic>, an invasive plant in Europe, has been evaluated as a potential insecticide and demonstrated moderate larvicidal activity against 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> [
