0: The use of synthetic pesticides for mosquito control has had detrimental effects on the environment [ 25, 26].
1: They tend to be persistent, toxic to non-target organisms, and insecticide resistance has been steadily increasing in mosquito species [ 27].
2: Essential oils have been suggested as viable, environmentally benign, and renewable alternatives to synthetic pesticides [ 28, 29, 30, 31, 32].
3: We have recently studied several introduced invasive plant species in Vietnam for potential use as mosquito vector control agents [ 33, 34, 35], and as part of our ongoing efforts in identifying readily-available essential oils for mosquito control, we have examined three  Conyza species for larvicidal activity against  Aedes aegypti,  Aedes albopictus, and  Culex quinquefasciatus, with the aim of identifying new mosquito-control essential oils and the components responsible for the activity.
