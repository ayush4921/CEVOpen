0: Non-native invasive plant species are generally detrimental to the local environments where they have been introduced.
1: They can outcompete native plant species and reduce biodiversity [ 17], they can alter ecosystem functions [ 18], and can have substantial economic impacts [ 19].
2: Control methods for invasive plants have generally included application of herbicides, physical cutting, or burning [ 20].
3: However, harvesting invasive species for beneficial uses as a method for control of invasive species may provide economic incentives to offset eradication costs [ 21].
4: For example,  Melaleuca quinquinervia trees in south Florida have been cut and chipped for landscape mulch and boiler fuel [ 22]; it has been suggested that mechanical harvesting of invasive cattail ( Typha spp.
5: ), common reed ( Phragmites australis), and reed canary grass ( Phalaris arundinacea) from coastal wetlands of Lake Ontario can be used as an agricultural nutrient source or as a biofuel [ 23].
6: The leaf essential oil of  Solidago canadensis, an invasive plant in Europe, has been evaluated as a potential insecticide and demonstrated moderate larvicidal activity against  Cx.
7: quinquefasciatus [ 24].
