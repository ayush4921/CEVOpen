<p>The larvicidal activities of 
 <italic>Conyza</italic> essential oils roughly coincides with the concentration of limonene in the samples (41.5%, 25.5%, and 0.2%, respectively, for 
 <italic>C. canadensis</italic>, 
 <italic>C. sumatrensis</italic>, and 
 <italic>C. bonariensis</italic>), and this relationship is borne out in a principle component analysis based on the major essential oil components (limonene, 
 <italic>allo</italic>-aromadendrene, (
 <italic>Z</italic>)-lachnophyllum ester, caryophyllene oxide, β-caryophyllene, β-pinene, (
 <italic>E</italic>)-β-farnesene, spathulenol, and α-humulene, along with the 24-h larvicidal activities) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04576-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Limonene has shown excellent larvicidal activities against 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (24-h LC
 <sub>50</sub> = 17.7 μg/mL) and 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> (24-h LC
 <sub>50</sub> = 31.6 μg/mL) (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04576-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) as well as 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> (LC
 <sub>50</sub> 10.8-41.8 μg/mL) [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-25-04576" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Consistent with these results, Zeng and co-workers found the larvicidal activity of 
 <italic>C. canadensis</italic> from China (14.8% limonene) to be 56.9 μg/mL and 32.1 μg/mL against 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> and 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic>, respectively [
 <xref rid="B54-molecules-25-04576" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. These workers also appreciated the remarkable larvicidal activity and noted that 
 <italic>C. canadensis</italic> essential oil has a potential for further development. Furthermore, 
 <italic>Citrus</italic> peel oils, rich in limonene, have also shown remarkable larvicidal activities against 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B61-molecules-25-04576" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] and 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> [
