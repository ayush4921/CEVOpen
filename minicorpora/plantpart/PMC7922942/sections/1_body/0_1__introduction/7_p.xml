<p>Despite the existence of numerous studies suggesting the suitability of EOs as an alternative treatment strategy for fungal infections, it should be noted that these properties are highly dependent on the composition of the EO itself. These compositions are prone to significant variability based upon the use of different plant parts or the harvesting season [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-26-01093" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Terpenes and their metabolic derivatives constitute the major component of Eos; these include functional derivatives of alcohols (geraniol), ketones (menthone), esters (cedryl acetate) and phenols (thymol). In addition, nonterpene compounds derived from phenylpropane (eugenol) are present in smaller percentages [

 <italic>Curcuma longa</italic> L. EO effects have been demonstrated against 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic>, in addition to aflatoxin inhibition. An interesting observation with exposure to this EO was reported via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis, that signified hyphae membranes and conidiophores damage in 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-26-01093" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Likewise, EO of 
 <italic>Matricaria chamomilla</italic> L. flower was investigated against 
 <italic>A. niger</italic>, revealing apparent destruction of cytoplasmic membranes and intracellular organelles, plasma membrane detachment from the cell wall and complete disorientation of the hyphal compartment [
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-26-01093" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In addition to modification of the ultrastructure, a number of studies have examined the underlying mechanisms behind the proapoptotic effects of EOs. An example of this is 
 <italic>Ocimum sanctum</italic> L. EO, which induced major cytotoxicity in 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, where complete ergosterol depletion, membrane disintegration, DNA fragmentation, increased outsourcing of membrane phosphatidylserine and cytochrome c oxidase activity were observed [
