0: In general, fungal diseases are differentiated into four groups: dermatophytosis, subcutaneous mycoses, systemic mycoses and other mycoses [ 4].
1: Dermatophytosis is caused by dermatophytes that attack and grow on dead animal keratin.
2: Epidermophyton, Microsporum and  Trichophyton are the three main genera related to dermatophytes.
3: Dermatophytes are known as a species of fungi that typically infect and invade a living hosts skin, hair and nails.
4: Diseases caused by dermatophytes are typically classified according to the infection site, but are broadly referred to as tinea.
5: Several forms of tinea are common such as  Tinea capitis (scalp and hair),  Tinea corporis (nonhairy skin),  Tinea barbae (beard),  Tinea cruris (groin),  Tinea manuum (hand),  Tinea pedis (feet) and  Tinea unguium (nails, also called onchomyosis) [ 18].
6: According to current practice, five classes of conventional antifungal treatments are commonly applied.
7: Figure 1 shows each antifungal agent and its mechanism of action.
