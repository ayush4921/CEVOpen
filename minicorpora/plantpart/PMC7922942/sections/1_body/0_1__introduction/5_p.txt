0: Thyme EO ( Thymus sp.)
1: is recognized as a promising antifungal agent due to the presence of thymol and carvacrol at high concentrations [ 28].
2: A study conducted with one of the most common thyme EO,  T. vulgaris, indicated strong antifungal activity against  A. flavus at a concentration of 350 ppm [ 29].
3: Rasooli and colleagues performed a comparative study of antifungal activity against  A. niger using  T. eriocalyx (Ronniger) Jalas, Rech.f.
4: and  T. x-porlock, showing superior activity of  T. eriocalyx, with a MIC value of 125 ppm [ 30].
5: Another EO that has been widely explored is cinnamon oil ( Cinnamomum sp.
6: ), with cinnamaldehyde as its major component.
7: An investigation of the antifungal effect of  C. zeylanicum exhibited a synergistic effect with Fluconazole against  A. fumigatus [ 31, 32, 33].
8: Similarly,  Eucalyptus globulus EO has been shown to possess potent antifungal activity; one study examined its effect on growth inhibition  of A. flavus, A. niger, A. terreus and  A. fumigatus [ 34].
9: S. aromaticum has also shown antifungal efficacy against different  Aspergillus spp.
10: ( A. terreus, A. flavus and  A. fumigatus) [ 29, 35, 36, 37].
