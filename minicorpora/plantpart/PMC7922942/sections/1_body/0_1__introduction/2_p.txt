0: Aspergillus spp.
1: is a filamentous and ubiquitous fungi with  A. fumigatus as the major species associated with human disease, followed by  A. flavus,  A. niger and  A. terreus [ 3, 8, 9].
2: In addition to the most common species, several other emerging species exist, including  A. clavatus,  A. nidulans,  A. glaucus and  A. ustus [ 6, 9].
3: Fusarium spp.
4: are other fungi that can cause human infections, and are the primary cause of fungal keratitis.
5: This fungus is the second most common to infect severely immunocompromised patients and cause disseminated infection [ 10].
6: F. solani has been identified as the most frequent pathogen in fusarial keratitis incidence, while  F. oxysporum leads to major incidences of onychomycosis [ 11, 12, 13].
7: Candida spp.
8: are tiny, oval-shaped fungi with a thin cell wall that are capable of budding or fission.
9: Among the identified species, five are the leading cause of invasive infections ( C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicals and,  C. krusei) [ 14].
10: Invasive candidiasis often occurs as a form of healthcare-associated infection, where affected patients are typically receiving broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment, immunosuppressants, or suffering from cancer [ 15].
11: Candidiasis infections typically exist on the epithelial surfaces of the mouth, gastrointestinal tract, vagina and skin surfaces.
12: C. albicans remains the most common cause of skin, nail and mucous membrane infections in healthy individuals, in whom it may also induce more severe infections of the vital organs [ 16, 17].
