0: Fungal infections arising from  Candida spp.
1: are called candidiasis; the most commonly implicated species is  C. albicans.
2: Fluconazole and itraconazole are widely utilized for such infections, but these agents have caused azole resistance within  Candida spp.
3: [ 3, 39, 40].
4: The antifungal properties of EOs derived from  Melaleuca sp.,  Origanum sp.,  Thymus sp.,  Mentha sp.,  Syzgium sp.,  Coriandrum sp.,  Cuminum sp.
5: and several others against  Candida spp.
6: were noted [ 2].
7: Melaleuca sp.
8: is the main genus to have been studied for its anticandida properties.
9: In a study by Mondello and colleagues, it was observed that  C. krusei and  C. gabrata showed sensitivity towards  M. alternifolia EO; additionally, all azole resistant  C. albicans were killed within 30 and 60 min at 1% and 0.25% concentration, respectively [ 41].
10: Antifungal activity was also observed from  T. pulegiosides EO, that inhibited  C. albicans,  C. glabrata,  C. parapsilosis,  C. krusei and  C. guillermondii with a MIC value range of 0.320.64 L/mL [ 28].
11: Peppermint EO is also highly capable as an antifungal agent.
12: Studies have revealed its inhibition capacity against  Candida spp., dermatophytes and  Aspergillus spp.
13: when tested within 407000, 8003500 and 4003500 g/mL, respectively [ 42].
14: Lavandula angustifolia, or lavender EO has also exhibited excellent antifungal activity against  Candida spp.
15: [ 43, 44].
16: Cumin EO effectiveness as an antifungal agent has also been proven with respect to  C. albicans, resulting in MIC values of 3.90 and 11.71 g/mL [ 45].
