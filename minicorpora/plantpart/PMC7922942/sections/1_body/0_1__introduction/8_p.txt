0: However, it has also been suggested that the cytotoxic effects of EOs are mediated by induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) over synthesis and oxidative stress.
1: A study performed with  Anethum graveolens L. seed EO revealed apoptosis in a  C. albicans strain via ATPase activity decrease, chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation, phosphatidylserine exposure, cytochrome c release and metacaspase activation.
2: This study highlighted the role of L-cysteine in the prevention of apoptosis, which is a sign of ROS action [ 50].
3: Aflatoxins, i.e., harmful fungal toxins, have also attracted much interest relative to the potential effects of EOs [ 21].
4: Several studies have suggested positive inhibition outcomes for aflatoxin with the application of EOs, such as  Chenopodium ambrosioides L., that suppressed the synthesis of aflatoxin B1 by the aflatoxigenic strain of  A. flavus [ 51].
5: Similar results were also observed with  Zataria multiflora Boiss EO, which decreased the growth of aflatoxin in  A. parasiticus, indicating a link with gene inhibition of the biosynthesis pathways for aflatoxin [ 52].
