<p>In general, fungal diseases are differentiated into four groups: dermatophytosis, subcutaneous mycoses, systemic mycoses and other mycoses [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-26-01093" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Dermatophytosis is caused by dermatophytes that attack and grow on dead animal keratin. 
 <italic>Epidermophyton, Microsporum</italic> and 
 <italic>Trichophyton</italic> are the three main genera related to dermatophytes. Dermatophytes are known as a species of fungi that typically infect and invade a living hostâ€™s skin, hair and nails. Diseases caused by dermatophytes are typically classified according to the infection site, but are broadly referred to as tinea. Several forms of tinea are common such as 
 <italic>Tinea capitis</italic> (scalp and hair), 
 <italic>Tinea corporis</italic> (nonhairy skin), 
 <italic>Tinea barbae</italic> (beard), 
 <italic>Tinea cruris</italic> (groin), 
 <italic>Tinea manuum</italic> (hand), 
 <italic>Tinea pedis</italic> (feet) and 
 <italic>Tinea unguium</italic> (nails, also called onchomyosis) [
