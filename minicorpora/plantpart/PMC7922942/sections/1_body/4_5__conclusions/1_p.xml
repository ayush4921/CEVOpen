<p>In conclusion, our review underlines the fact that the importance of antifungal agents EOs is widely recognized. Their roles in reducing the severity of fungal infections vary according to species and origin. Based on our review, we strongly believe that EOs should be explored for commercial applications as alternatives to over-the-counter antifungal agents. In addition, commercial applications could be further enhanced with nonconventional strategies in combination with other components, such as fluconazole and Tween 80. Hence, it is vital that efforts continue for the development of EO-based skin antifungal therapies.</p>
