<p>One more interesting study described the antifungal activity of 
 <italic>C. martini</italic> and 
 <italic>C. ambrosioides</italic> EO, along with their combinations, against several dermatophytes and filamentous fungi via in vitro as well as in vivo (guinea pig) tests. 
 <italic>C. martini</italic> belongs to the Poaceae family, and is a known medicinal plant that possesses thermogenic, diuretic and insecticidal activity [

 <xref rid="B132-molecules-26-01093" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>]. Its EO was prepared by mixing 1 mL of the oil with 100 g petroleum jelly. An in vivo study indicated significant efficacy of the EO against superficial mycosis, with a reduction in skin redness, lesion severity and dermatophyte occurrence upon ointment application, as confirmed via recurrence of hair growth at the infected site, compared to the control. The disease was successfully removed within 7â€“21 days via the application of EO ointments [
