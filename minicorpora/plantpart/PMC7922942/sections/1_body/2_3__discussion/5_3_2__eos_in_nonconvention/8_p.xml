<p>In addition, in vitro evaluation of both EO also inhibited the growth of 
 <italic>T. rubrum</italic> and 
 <italic>M. gypseum</italic>, with low MIC values that signified their potential role as alternatives to synthetic antifungal drugs. A chemical characterization indicated the presence of trans-geranoil (60.9%) and m-cymene (43.9%) as the major components of 
 <italic>C. martini</italic> oil and 
 <italic>C. ambrosioides</italic> EOs, respectively. One important element in this study was the more efficient synergistic effect obtained with a combination of both EOs in a 1:1 ratio than 
 <italic>C. ambrosioides</italic> alone, indicating fungitoxicity alteration effects with the formation of combined chemical profiles. The MIC of EO and combination were shown to be around 150–500 ppm, which was comparatively lower than those of commercial drugs, which are usually higher, at around 1000–5500 ppm. In conclusion, this study highlighted the ability of both EOs, individually or in combination, to serve as a suitable strategy in the treatment of various superficial mycoses in humans, and recommended that clinical trials be performed [
