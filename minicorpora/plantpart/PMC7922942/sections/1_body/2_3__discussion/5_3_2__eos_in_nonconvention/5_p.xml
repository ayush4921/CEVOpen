<p>Several combination studies with in vitro and in vivo approaches also evaluated nonconventional technologies. One example is a study that investigated the potential of LGEO using nonconventional technology that incorporated the formulation of a topical hydrogel with lemongrass-loaded nano-sponges for antifungal action against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> strain ATC 100231. Nano-sponges are a novel class of encapsulated nanoparticles that serves as an excellent delivery system in both the pharmaceutical and cosmeceutical industries [

This technology has received much attention in recent years, as it combines the benefits of both microsponges and nanosized-mediated delivery systems. Nanosponges with topical hydrogels have been shown to cause minimal irritation, fewer adverse effects as well as improved skin retention when compared with conventional topical delivery systems [

Similarly, this nonconventional approach was proven to be effective, i.e., the results confirmed the superior nonirritant and antifungal effects of the final selected hydrogel (F9) from among nine tested formulations. The MIC and MFC concentrations of LGEO using the broth macrodilution method was found to be 2 and 8 ÂµL/mL, respectively. The results were promising, especially for the practical approach of using pharmaceutical formulations as a measure to minimize the risk of folk medicine usage in the crude form [
