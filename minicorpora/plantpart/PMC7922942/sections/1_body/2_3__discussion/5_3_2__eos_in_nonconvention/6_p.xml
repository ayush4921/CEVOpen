<p>Another study by Gemeda and others conducted with EO from 
 <italic>C. martini</italic> showcased broad-spectrum antimicrobial potency against all tested organisms, with MIC value ranging from 0.65 to 10 Î¼g/mL. 
 <italic>C. martini</italic> EO demonstrated absolute growth inhibitions of 
 <italic>Trichophyton mentagrophytes</italic> and 
 <italic>T. rubrum</italic> (&gt;1% EO concentration), as well as 
 <italic>M. canis</italic> and 
 <italic>T. verrucosum</italic> (&gt;4% EO concentration) [

A total of five base formulations (hydrophilic ointment, macrogol blend ointment, macrogol cream, simple ointment and white petrolatum base) were prepared with different concentrations of the EO by incorporating the oil into soft mass of different dermatological bases. The findings demonstrated that both hydrophilic and macrogol blend ointments with 
 <italic>C. martini</italic> EO demonstrated superior activity upon tested organisms than relevant commercial drugs. Furthermore, a skin sensitization test with guinea pig showed no sign of irritation or sensitization when tested with 5% EO topical formulation. Hence, this product was believed to be a suitable alternative to established treatments, although extended studies are required to evaluate the safety, chronic toxicity and efficacy [
