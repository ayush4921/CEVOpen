<p>Nonconventional technology is defined as a combinatorial approach of an EO with an absorption base (e.g., ointments). This approach was applied in one study that examined the effect of 
 <italic>L. multifora</italic> (Lippia oil) in combination with six types of ointment base and incorporation of Tween 80 at four different concentrations to another set. The findings of this study revealed that the most effective inhibitory action was obtained when lippia oil (10% 
 <italic>w/w</italic>) was combined with Hydrous Wool Fat Ointment BP (British Pharmacopoeia method) or Simple Ointment BP, with added Tween 80 (6% 
 <italic>w/w</italic>) upon testing of 
 <italic>C. pseudotropicalis</italic> and 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>. The incorporation of Tween 80 further enhanced the efficacy of this formulation, suggesting its suitability as a nonconventional treatment strategy [
