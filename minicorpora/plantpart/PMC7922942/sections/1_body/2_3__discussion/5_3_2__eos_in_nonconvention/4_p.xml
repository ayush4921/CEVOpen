 <italic>R. officinalis</italic>, 
 <italic>Lavandula x intermedia</italic> “Sumian” and 
 <italic>O. vulgare subsp. hirtum</italic> are among the most common medicinal plants in the Mediterranean region. They were widely used and have been synergistically tested for the treatment of candidiasis. Research on the HaCaT (normal cell line) and A431 (tumoral cell line) reported its safety for use as an antiproliferative agent. In vitro studies against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, 
 <italic>C. krusei</italic> and 
 <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic> showed an increase in the antifungal activity of clotrimazole-loaded nanoparticles (NLC). NLC containing Mediterranean EOs represents a promising strategy to improve drug effectiveness against topical candidiasis [

 <italic>Lonicera x bella zabel),</italic> Kewda (
 <italic>P. odoratissimus</italic>), Rajnigandha (
 <italic>P. tuberosa</italic>) and Mogra (
 <italic>J. sambac</italic>) were tested against 
 <italic>A. flavus, T. mentagrophytes, T. tonsurans, T. verrucosum, E. floccosum</italic> and 
 <italic>M. nanum</italic>. The results showed better antifungal activity with EOs compared to synthetic drugs, i.e., terbinafine, itraconazole and fluconazole. 
 <italic>T. tosurans</italic> was inhibited up to 47 mm by Itra-Bella, indicating that keratinophilic fungi could be successfully inhibited by Itra-Bella [
