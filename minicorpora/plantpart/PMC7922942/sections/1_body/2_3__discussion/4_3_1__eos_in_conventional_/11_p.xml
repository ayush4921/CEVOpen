<p>Since ancient times, several 
 <italic>Thymus</italic> species have been used in traditional medicine to combat pathogenic microorganisms. In a study by Goncalves et al. [
 <xref rid="B63-molecules-26-01093" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], chemical profiling and antifungal activity of four types of oils from 
 <italic>Thymus zygis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>sylvestris</italic> were evaluated against yeasts, dermatophyte and 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> strains. Carvacrol (25.0%), thymol (23.8%), geranyl acetate (20.8%), geraniol (19.8%) and linalool (30.0%) were the major identified components. MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay revealed that the oil composed of high carvacrol concentrations presented stronger antifungal activities against dermatophytes, with no cytotoxic effect at 0.08–0.16 μL/mL, for up to 24 h. A lack of cytotoxicity was also observed with this oil in mouse skin dendritic cells at concentrations where significant antifungal activity was obtained (0.16 μL/mL). Based on these findings, it was proposed that 
 <italic>T. zygis</italic> EO is highly capable as an antifungal agent with minimal detrimental effects, and that it should be explored in more detail [
