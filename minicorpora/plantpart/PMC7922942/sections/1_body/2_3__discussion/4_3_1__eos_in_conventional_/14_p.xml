<p>The antifungal activity of 
 <italic>D. tenuifolium</italic> EO was evaluated against yeast, dermatophyte and 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> strains. The oils revealed significant antifungal activity against 
 <italic>C. neoformans</italic> and dermatophyte strains, and significantly inhibited NO production stimulated by LPS in macrophages, without affecting cell viability at concentrations ranging from 0.64â€“1.25 L/mL. A chemical analysis found that the oil was mostly composed of monoterpene hydrocarbons with myrcene as the major component. This research provided significant information about the pharmacological activities of 
 <italic>D. tenuifolium</italic> EO which is relevant to its use as an antifungal and anti-inflammatory agent for treatment of contact dermatitis, skin infections as well as its role as an anti-inflammatory agent. Thus, it was proposed that its beneficial effects and usage for the prevention of diseases related to fungal and inflammation need to be further examined [
