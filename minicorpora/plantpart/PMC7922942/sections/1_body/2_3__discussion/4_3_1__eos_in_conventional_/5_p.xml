<p>Two more genera of fungi are commonly related to skin diseases: 
 <italic>Microsporum</italic> and 
 <italic>Trichophyton</italic>. These opportunistic filamentous fungi belong to dermatophytes [
 <xref rid="B109-molecules-26-01093" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. From our review, we found that many studies have been done to find methods to counter these two species. 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> is one of the most widely distributed species of the Asteraceae family, and is well-known for its pharmacological benefits. 
 <italic>A. sieberi</italic> was tested on dermatophytes against several strains (
 <italic>T. rubrum, T. mentagrophytes, M. canis, M. gypseum, T. schoenleinii</italic> and 
 <italic>T. verrucosum var. album</italic>), revealing higher sensitivity of 
 <italic>M. gypseum, T. rubrum</italic> and 
 <italic>M. canis</italic> and suggesting its suitability as a topical antifungal agent. However, this study indicated that collection site and harvest time affect the yield and chemical composition of the EO, although no significant differences were observed with respect to its antidermatophyte activities [
