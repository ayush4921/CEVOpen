<p>Rezgui and colleagues studied the effects of 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> EO, extract and its active compound (marrubiin), and observed approximately 50% inhibition for 
 <italic>T. mentagrophytes</italic> and 
 <italic>E. floccosum</italic> with respect to marrubiin tested at 100 mg/mL. Antiphytopathogenic activity was also conducted, with only marrubiin being found to be active against 
 <italic>B. cinerea</italic> at the highest dose (32.40%). The authors concluded that 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> and marrubiin could be used as natural antifungal agents for skin dermatophyte infections [

 <italic>Myristica fragrans</italic> is an edible plant that grows in the evergreen forests of West Africa. The seeds have both economic and medicinal value, especially for the local community. Inhibition was observed against several pathogenic fungi, e.g., 
 <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> (1.3 cm), 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> (0.8 cm), 
 <italic>R. miehei</italic> (0.6 cm) and 
 <italic>C. glabrata</italic> (0.6 cm) with 
 <italic>M. fragrans</italic> EO, although no inhibition was reported with 
 <italic>A. niger</italic> and 
 <italic>A. fumigates</italic> [
