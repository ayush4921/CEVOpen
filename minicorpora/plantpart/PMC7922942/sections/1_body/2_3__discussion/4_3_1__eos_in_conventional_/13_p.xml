 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> L. belongs to the Lamiaceae family; it was evaluated for its antifungal and anti-inflammatory activity. 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> EO indicated antifungal activities against dermatophytes and significantly inhibited nitric oxide (NO) production stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in macrophages without affecting cell viability in concentrations up to 0.64 Î¼L/mL. This study claimed to be the first report on the in vitro anti-inflammatory potential of 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> oil; the authors demonstrated that the bioactive concentrations of 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> oils did not affect the mammalian macrophages and keratinocytes, making them suitable for use in skin care formulation for cosmetic and pharmaceuticals applications [
