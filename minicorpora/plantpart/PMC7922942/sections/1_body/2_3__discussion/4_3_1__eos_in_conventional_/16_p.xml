<p>In addition to in vitro approaches, several investigations were also conducted with in vivo models combined with in vitro approaches. Among the most widely covered EOs in this review for combined approaches were 
 <italic>P. jacquemontiana</italic>, 
 <italic>C. martini</italic>, 
 <italic>C. ambrosioides</italic>, 
 <italic>C. citratus, T. ammi</italic> and 
 <italic>A. houstonianum</italic> Mill. 
 <italic>P. jacquemontiana</italic> is an aromatic plant of the Hamamelidaceae family, and is well-recognized for its medicinal value, especially in terms of treating skin infections or eruptions, relieving body aches and minimizing dermatitis, along with its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant hepatoprotective activities, as shown in experimental rats [

 <xref rid="B113-molecules-26-01093" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. The study revealed excellent antifungal characteristics of 
 <italic>P. jacquemontiana</italic> EO against seven fungi and one yeast strain. The maximum inhibition zone was obtained with 
 <italic>Mucor piriformis</italic> ATCC 52554 (19.83 ± 1.04 mm), while 
 <italic>F. solani</italic> ATCC 36031 resulted in a minimum inhibition zone of 13.13 ± 1.03 mm and a maximum MIC value of 512 μg/mL [
