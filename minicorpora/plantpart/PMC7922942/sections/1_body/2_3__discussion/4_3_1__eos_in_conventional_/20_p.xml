 <italic>C. citratus</italic> (DC.) 
 <italic>Stapf</italic> (Poaceae family), commonly known as lemon grass, is a perennial tropical grass with thin, long leaves. It is one of the main medicinal and aromatic plants cultivated in Algeria, as well as in the tropical and sub-tropical regions of Asia, South America, and Africa [

 <italic>C. citratus</italic> EO (LGEO) exhibits promising antifungal effect against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, 
 <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> and 
 <italic>A. niger</italic>, with different inhibition zone diameters (IZD), i.e., 35â€“90 mm, that increase proportionately with the increase in the oil volume. A chemical characterization of LGEO indicated the presence of geranial and neral as the major components, representing about 42.2 and 31.5%, respectively; its antifungal activity was associated with the presence of these compounds. The diameter of the growth inhibition zone (DGIZ) of LGEO in the vapor phase was found to be superior to the liquid phase, which is believed to be more advantageous in terms of application ease, elimination of the need for direct contact with the oil, and the requirement of using less oil. In vivo evaluation with Swiss albino mice showed considerable anti-inflammatory activity, where the degree of edema inhibition was similar for 10 and 100 mg/kg LGEO 90 min after oral administration (82.75 and 86.2%, respectively). This level of edema inhibition was comparable to that observed using 50 mg/kg oral doses of the standard reference drug, diclofenac (86.2%). The analysis of the inhibition degree of croton oil topical application resulted in noticeable edema on the left ear. On the whole, LGEO, as an antifungal and anti-inflammatory agent, is believed to be effective, both in the prevention and treatment of acute inflammatory skin conditions. In line with this potential, this research introduced ideas for additional evaluations of active constituents, specific action mechanisms and drug discovery for alternative antifungal therapies [
