<p>The development of numerous nonconventional approaches in antifungal therapies indicates great potential. In addition to the reviewed articles, one prominent technique that has gained attention is the application of cyclodextrins via encapsulation. This technique involves the formation of inclusion complexes of selected oils with cyclodextrins (CDs). In a study performed by Torres-Alvarez and colleagues, concentrated orange oils were subjected to encapsulation with β-CD and evaluated for their antifungal activity. This study noted that the highest antifungal activity inhibition was achieved at 10 mg/mL, respective to 10× fraction orange oil in ratios of 12:88 and 16:84 (COEO: β-CD). Hence, the encapsulation technique proved to be beneficial toward inhibition, although the researchers proposed further studies to confirm the formation of the complex and the encapsulated compounds [
