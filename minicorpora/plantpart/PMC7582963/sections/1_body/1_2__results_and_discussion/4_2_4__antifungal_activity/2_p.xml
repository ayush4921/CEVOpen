<p>Other works have highlighted the activity of essential oils on growth of many bacteria species. Essential oils of 
 <italic>Melaleuca</italic> showed strong inhibitory effects against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>S. enteric</italic>, with inhibition of about 89% [

 <italic>P. harmala</italic> exhibited good antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities [

 <xref rid="B35-molecules-25-04569" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] mentioned that soybean and palm oils were major commercial sources of tocopherols (20% δ-T and 65% γ-T) and tocotrienols, respectively. To our knowledge, the biological activity of δ-T, separately, has not been well studied and should be considered in further work, especially because we found a high δ-T content in our study.
