<p>Recent studies investigated the pharmaceutical application, chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oils extracted from seeds of 
 <italic>P. harmala</italic> [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-25-04569" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, there are few reports concerning the chemical composition and microbiological activity of oils extracted from 
 <italic>P. harmala</italic> seeds [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-25-04569" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The present paper focuses on the tocols (i.e., tocopherols and tocotrienols) and fatty acid composition of seed oils of 
 <italic>P. harmala</italic> plants, collected from different regions of Tunisia. Based on the wide geographic distribution of 
 <italic>P. harmala</italic> in Tunisia with semi-arid, arid and Saharan climatic zones, we hypothesized that the geographic origin of the plant affected the tocol and fatty acid contents of the oils extracted from seeds. Various studies showed that tocols and fatty acids have many antifungal activities [

 <xref rid="B16-molecules-25-04569" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Knowledge of bio-active components would highlight the importance of traditional uses of medicinal plants and enrich the global database of phytochemicals. Plant compounds are usually influenced by geographical distribution. In this study, the principal constituents and antifungal effect of Tunisian 
 <italic>P. harmala</italic> seed oil were addressed.
