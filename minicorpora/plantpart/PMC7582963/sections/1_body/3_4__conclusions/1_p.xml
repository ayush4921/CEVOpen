<p>All seed oils of 
 <italic>P. harmala</italic> populations contained very high levels of tocols (2722.68 mg/100 g), with δ-T the most abundant isomer (2441.78 mg/100 g) followed by γ-T (205.46 mg/100 g). We noted also the presence of tocotrienols for the first time in 
 <italic>P. harmala</italic>. The preponderance of the two components (δ- and γ-T) explained the pertinent antifungal activity against the selected fungi and suggests that 
 <italic>P. harmala</italic> has promise as an alternative approach for biological control of other microorganisms. In addition, the high levels in fatty acids in the 
 <italic>P. harmala</italic> seeds, compared with other plants cited in the literature, revealed the importance of this plant as a new potential source of biofuel and for further medicinal applications. This idea is supported by the wide geographic spread of 
 <italic>P. harmala</italic> in Tunisia and the adaptability of this species to various climactic conditions.
