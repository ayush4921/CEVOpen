0: Moreover, the good adaptability of  M. oleifera to different soils and climate is remarkable, along with its easy propagation [ 7], which is directly related to its suitable adaptation to climate change in regions where mild conditions have changed to arid ones, such as in the Mediterranean area.
1: Hence,  M. oleifera trees are being promoted as a dual solution to mitigate the impacts of climate change, while also providing an alternative source of income for families.
2: The trees are easy to plant and do not require much maintenance.
3: The planting process includes a water conservation approach that uses only 5 L of water during planting and 250100 mL per day afterwards, decreasing as the tree grows and its roots establish [ 8].
4: In addition, the rate of absorption of carbon dioxide by the  M. oleifera tree is twenty times higher than that of the general vegetation [ 9, 10, 11].
5: Therefore, the  M. oleifera tree is useful tool in the prevention of global warming.
