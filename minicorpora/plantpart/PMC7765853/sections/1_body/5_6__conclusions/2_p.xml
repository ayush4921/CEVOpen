 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> is a highly variable species. The important variability of the essential oil composition depends on climate, environmental conditions, and geographical area. The phytochemical profile of OEO was extensively studied, and three main 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> chemotypes were established, depending on the proportions of acyclic linalool/linalyl acetate, cymyl, and sabinyl compounds. The most investigated OEO are characterized by the presence of higher concentrations of carvacrol, thymol. Still, standardization of OEO according to main compounds is of great importance for relevant correlation with its biological activity.
