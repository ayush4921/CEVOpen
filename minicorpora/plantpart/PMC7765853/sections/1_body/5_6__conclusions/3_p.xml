<p>OEO particularly high in carvacrol and thymol represents an efficient alternative as antimicrobial agent against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains including multiresistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>. The antioxidant activity of OEO is attributed to the presence of the same compounds. OEO decreases the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and of inflammatory genes, due to the presence of carvacrol, emphasizing multiple mechanisms of action. The antitumor effects of OEO were reported for several types of cancer, including breast, colon, hepatic, or cervical cancer, with IC50 values ranging approximatively from 8 to 300 Âµg/mL.
