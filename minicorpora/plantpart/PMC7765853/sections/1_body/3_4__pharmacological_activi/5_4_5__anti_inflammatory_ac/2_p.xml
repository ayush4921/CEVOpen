<p>Cheng et al. determined the anti-inflammatory effect on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) murine macrophage cells (RAW264.7) after treatment with OEO (acquired from Meritech Bioengineering Co. Ltd. Guangzhou, China). ELISA commercial kits revealed the decreased levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α after 12 h treatment with OEO (2.5, 5, 10 μg/mL). Chemiluminescence assay measured the ROS (reactive oxygen species) level using luminol. Moreover, pretreatment with OEO (2.5, 5, 10 μg/mL) restrained the ROS generation within the RAW264.7 cells in the presence of lipopolysaccharide. Noteworthy, LPS may initiate an inflammatory response through nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase activation. Furthermore, ROS production can be counteracted by inhibitors against NADPH oxidase. Therefore, the research team evaluated the NADPH oxidase activity of RAW264.7 cells treated with OEO, using ELISA kits. The results have shown that the OEO inhibited the lipopolysaccharide inflammatory response driven by NADPH oxidase and oxidative stress [
