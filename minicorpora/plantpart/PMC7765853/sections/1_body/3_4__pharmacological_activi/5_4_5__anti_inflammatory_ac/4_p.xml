<p>Carrasco et al. studied the anti-inflammatory activity of essential oils from 3 types of oregano harvested from Supra-Mediterranean and upper Meso-Mediterranean bioclimatic areas (Murcia, Spain). OEO samples were analyzed by GC-MS to determine their composition. (E)-
 <italic>β</italic>-Caryophyllene (0.5–4.9%), thymol (0.2–5.8%), 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (3.8–8.2%), 
 <italic>γ</italic>-terpinene (2.1–10.7%), and carvacrol (58.7–77.4%) were determined as main molecules. Sample from the Upper Meso-Mediterranean bioclimatic zone had the greatest inhibitory activity against lipoxygenase (LOX) (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 251.5 ± 1.4 µL EO/L) due to the presence of carvacrol and 
 <italic>γ</italic>-terpinene as major compounds [
