<p>In a comprehensive study, Avola et al. investigated the biological effects of OEO (provided by Esperis S.p.A., Milan, Italy) in the restoring of the physiological cell homeostasis during wound and inflammation phenomena. To accomplish this, human keratinocyte cell line NCTC 2544 was used as an inflammatory in vitro model obtained by interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and histamine stimulation or as a wound model attained by scratching the confluent monolayer of keratinocytes. The cultures treated with OEO showed a significantly lower level of ROS compared to the control. Furthermore, analysis regarding the amount of mRNA and proteins of ICAM-1, iNOS, and COX-2 were assessed by RT-PCR and Western blot. The results marked that the addition of OEO (25 µg/mL) for 72 h significantly reduced mRNA of ICAM-1, iNOS, and COX-2, suggesting that OEO enables cell homeostasis restoration during inflammatory events. Besides, keratinocytes stimulated with IFN-γ and histamine showed high levels of MMP-12 (a skin elastase) involved in the metabolism of elastic fibers and associated with the decrease in skin elasticity and consequent formation of wrinkles in various types of tissues during acute or chronic inflammatory disease. Compared to indomethacin, OEO (25 μg/mL) inhibited the MMP-12 expression to a higher degree. Evaluation by immunoblotting, under inflammatory condition in human keratinocyte cell line, showed the increased expression levels of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a marker of proliferation, whereas the amount of PCNA signal was significantly decreased by treatment with OEO (25 μg/mL). These results indicated that OEO acts as both an inducer of cell proliferation and a supporter of wound healing by PCNA modulation [
