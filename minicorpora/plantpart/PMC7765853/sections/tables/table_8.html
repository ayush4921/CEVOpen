    <i>p</i>-cymene (0.2%),

    <br/>Nanoemulsion was tested in an acne animal mouse model (45 BALB/c, 6 weeks old, 20 g of weight) intradermally injected in ears with 20 µL of 
    <i>Propionibacterium acnes</i>. 
    <br/>They applied on infected mice ears, 20 µL of 2 MIC (1.34 mg/mL) oregano formulated nanoemulsion (test group), or 2% erythromycin (positive control), or no treatment (negative control) for 3 days.

   <td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mice treated with nanoemulsion presented a higher anti-inflammatory response (&gt;60%) compared to the positive control erythromycin (20%) 
    <br/>The in vivo antimicrobial activity of OEO nanoemulsion was assessed where bacterial 
    <br/>counts of 
    <i>Propionibacterium acnes</i> dropped from 1 × 10 
    <sup>8</sup> to 4.3 × 10

    <br/>The qualitative and quantitative characterization of OEO was assessed by GC and GC-MS. The main

    <br/>Antioxidant activity was evaluated in NCTC 2544 cells line measuring the 2′,7′ oxidation dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate and the incubation time was 72 h 
    <br/>Analysis regarding the amount of mRNA and proteins of ICAM-1, iNOS, and COX-2 were assessed by RT-PCR and Western blot

    <br/>Cell proliferation and viability of four concentrations of OEO (0.011, 0.0037, 0.0012, and 0.00041%,

    <br/>Results showed a significant antiproliferative activity to dermal fibroblast cells. OEO (0,0037% 
    <i>v/v</i> OEO) significantly decreased the levels of inflammatory biomarkers such as MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein 1), VCAM-1 (vascular cell adhesion molecule 1), ICAM-1 (intracellular cell adhesion molecule 1), IP-10 (Interferon gamma-induced protein 10), I-TAC (interferon-inducible T-cell alpha chemoattractant), and MIG (monokine induced by gamma interferon). Moreover, OEO diminished tissue remodelling biomarkers such as collagen I, collagen III, M-CSF (macrophage colony-stimulating factor), EGRF (epidermal growth factor receptor), MMP-1, PAI-1, TIMP-1 (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1), and TIMP- 2.
