<p>The results demonstrated that the total phenolics contents strongly depended on the plant species, geographical origin, and genetic content. Tables 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> are in accordance with the earlier research data, which stated that the high temperature with low altitude would increase the phenolic components (thymol and carvacrol) ratio in the oils [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In addition to these observations, it was also found that the ecological properties like high relative humidity would significantly increase the nonphenolic terpenes (linalool) and noncyclic monoterpenes (geraniol) ratios in some ecotypes. Despite these correlations, some components of 
 <italic>T. daenensis</italic> oils variation could not be interpreted only by the environmental conditions, and other factors like genetic background may affect the type and amount of the constituents. For instance, this compound was not detected in other ecotypes, even those with similar environmental conditions, while the content of noncyclic monoterpenes pulegone has increased in TD2 as an ecotype growing in high temperature [
