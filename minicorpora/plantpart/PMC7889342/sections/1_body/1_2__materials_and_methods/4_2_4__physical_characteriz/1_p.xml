<p>The yield was defined as the amount of essential oils formed (ml) related to the 100 g of consumed plant. The oil refractive indices and densities were measured using an Atago RX-7000a refractometer, and a liquid micro-pycnometer. The oils different serial concentrations were provided in methanol (1 : 2, 1 : 4, 1 : 8, 1 : 16, 1 : 32, 1 : 64, 1 : 128, 1 : 256 mg/ml), and absorption spectrum was recorded in absorbance range (230–1000 nm) using spectrophotometer (TECAN, Infinite®-M200; Austria). The oils molar absorptivity potencies against the UV light were attained using Beer's law (
