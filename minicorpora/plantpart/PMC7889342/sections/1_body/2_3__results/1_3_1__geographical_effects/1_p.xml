<p>Different morphological analyses 
 <italic>of Thymus daenensis</italic> ecotypes indicated a microenvironmental conditions distinct effect including altitude, humidity, and temperature on the plant height and also the total dry matter. This flowering plant is growing up to 35 cm tall with short trichomes on its leaves. The isolation process yields the yellowish oil with different productivity (0.36–0.86% v/w), based on the 
 <italic>Thymus</italic> geographical origins. In addition, other ecotypic oils physical properties presented diversity including density and molar extinction coefficient at 280 nm, and it seems that they can also be directly affected by environmental conditions (
