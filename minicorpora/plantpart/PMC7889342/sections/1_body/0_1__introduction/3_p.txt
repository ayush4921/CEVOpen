0: The main concern about the medicinal plants is related to the environmental conditions effect on their medicinal activities diversity.
1: Several studies have indicated that the climate, temperature, light, height above sea level, latitude, and longitude are the most important factors affecting the physical and biological behaviors of plants including their genetics, immunology, physiology, morphology, population divergence, and evolution properties [ 6].
2: Earlier studies highlighted the climate fluctuations influence on the EOs' composition of ecotypic  Thymus kotschanus and as well examined biological variety quantitatively in their antimicrobial, antioxidative, and antigenotoxic behaviors [ 7].
3: At the first step of this study, we focused on the  T. daenensis EO-mediated antimicrobial, antioxidative, and antigenotoxic behaviors.
4: Then, climate and altitude effects on the EOs' composition of ecotypic  T. daenensis and their biological diversity were investigated.
5: In addition to the antimicrobial activity, the antioxidant and antigenotoxic activities were reported.
