<p>The antioxidant power of biomolecules is an expression of their capability to defend from the actions of the free radicals and to prevent degeneration from oxidants. Plants of the Rosaceae family are rich in phytochemicals with a promising chemical structure for various biological activities, including anti-radical scavenging and antioxidant effects [

Three main types of assays are widely used in the study of the antioxidant activities of rose extracts: (i) tests for electron and/or radical scavenging and metal ion chelating (most in vitro); (ii) tests for the inhibition of lipid peroxidation (LP) (in vivo and in vitro); and (iii) tests of the influence of antioxidant enzyme activities (in vivo and in vitro) (
