<p>There are data showing that the composition of essential oils from the

According to Ruberto and Baratta (2000), these dominant components are the reason for the similarity in the biological activities of essential oils [

 <italic>R. damascena</italic> Mill. grown in different areas could be due to the different ratios of the main components, geraniol, citronellol, and nerol, in their composition [
