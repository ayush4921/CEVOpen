 <italic>R. damascena</italic> Mill. oil exhibits good antioxidant effects, not only in chemical and biological model systems but also in experimental models of oxidative stress in mice. In 
 <italic>ex vivo</italic> experiments with brain homogenates of mice treated withL-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), which causes increasing protein oxidation and LP, it was observed that the markers of oxidative stress were reduced upon pretreatment of the experimental animals with antioxidants vitamin C, Trolox, and 
 <italic>R. damascena</italic> Mill. essential oil. The effect of the combination of L-DOPA with damask rose oil was very similar to that of vitamin C and Trolox [
