 <xref rid="biomolecules-11-00127-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> shows the highest antimicrobial activities of essential oils and extracts of the observed 
 <italic>Rosa</italic> species. It is known that the antimicrobial effects of the studied essential oils are dependent to a large extent on their metabolic profile. The antimicrobial activity of the rose essential oils can be attributed to the contained monoterpenes that, due to their lipophilic character, act by disrupting the microbial cytoplasmic membrane, which thus loses its high impermeability for protons and larger ions [

 <xref rid="B92-biomolecules-11-00127" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. As antimicrobial agents, essential oils are able to target the bacterial cell walls and membranes, damage their permeability, and cause the collapse of normal cellular processes. When a disturbance of membrane integrity occurs, its functions are compromised.
