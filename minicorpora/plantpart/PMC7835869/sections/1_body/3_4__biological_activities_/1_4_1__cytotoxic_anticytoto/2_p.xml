<p>Various test methods were used to study the toxic/cytotoxic, mutagenic/antimutagenic, genotoxic/anti-genotoxic potential of the rose extracts and oils, both in vivo and in vitro. The MTT test, BrdU assay, double-staining fluorescence assay, and TUNEL (Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay) give information about the toxic/cytotoxic activity. They assess the cell viability, proliferative activity, and induction of apoptosis. The reverse mutation, somatic mutation, and the recombination test (SMART) are applied to study the mutagenic/antimutagenic activity, and to detect the genotoxic/anti-genotoxic potential. The tests for the induction of chromosomal aberrations, micronuclei, as well as comet assay, are used. They assess the frequency of mutations, changes in DNA integrity, changes in chromosome structure, and abnormalities in the course of mitosis.</p>
