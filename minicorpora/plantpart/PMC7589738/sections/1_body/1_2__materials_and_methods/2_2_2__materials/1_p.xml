<p>We used five samples, first called control sample (yoghurt in which no alginate capsules were added with volatile oil), the second one called the yoghurt sample with the addition of volatile mint oil, the third one called the yoghurt sample with volatile basil oil, the fourth one called the yoghurt sample with volatile fennel oil and the fifth one called the yoghurt sample with volatile lavender oil. We used the DPPH method to determinate antioxidant capacity, and the measurements were made on the first day after making yoghurt from cow milk, after 10 days and after 20 days. The cow’s milk was taken from a farm in the Sibiu area. Lavender, mint and basil were taken from a culture located in the Mureș area, and fennel was taken from a culture in the Ialomița area.</p>
