<p>For the extraction of the compounds to determine the antioxidant capacity of the yoghurt samples with volatile oils, we used the extraction method adapted after Patel et al. (2016). We weighed 0.5 g of the sample to be analyzed and then extracted it with 10 mL of the mixture methanol:water:hydrochloric acid 0.12 M = 70:29:1 (v/v/v), at room temperature, for 24 h. The mixture was then kept on the ultrasonic water bath for 30 min at a temperature of 25 °C. After the time ran out, the supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min. The residue was suspended in 10 mL of solvent to perform a second extraction for 15 min, on the bath of water at 25 °C. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged under the same conditions as the first. The total amount of supernatant was evaporated to the rotary evaporator and the residue was taken up with 10 mL of methanol. We filtered the mixture of supernatant and methanol and filled it to a volume of 10 mL with the same solvent [
