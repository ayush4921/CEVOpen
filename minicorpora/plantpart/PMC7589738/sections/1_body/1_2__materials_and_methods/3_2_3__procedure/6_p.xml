<p>To determine the antioxidant activity of the yoghurt samples with the addition of volatile oils encapsulated in sodium alginate, we used a method adapted according to the method applied by Tylkowski et al. (2011) for the ethanolic extracts of 
 <italic>Sideritis</italic> ssp. L. We prepared a 25 µg/mL DPPH solution by solubilizing a quantity of DPPH in absolute methanol — stock solution.This mixture needed to be prepared in advance—at least 1–2 h—for complete solubilization. A volume of 970 µL DPPH solution 25 µg/mL is measured and added over 30 µL methanol extract from the samples to be analyzed, which we obtained using the extraction shown above. To interpret the results, we measured the absorbance at 515 nm for each sample using the CECIL 1021 UV-VIS spectrophotometer and the concentration is determined according to the standard curve obtained from different concentrations of the stock solution [
