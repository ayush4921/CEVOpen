The highest antioxidant activity was on the first day and the lowest on the 20th day. On the first day, the highest value was 6.43%, and the lowest value was 6.37%. The antioxidant activity on day 10 is lower than on the first day. The highest value on the 10th day was 6.18%, and the lowest was 6.22%. On day 20, the yoghurt sample with volatile fennel oil had the lowest antioxidant activity. The highest value recorded was 6.04%, and the lowest was 5.95%. The average value for each day was 6.40% for the first day, 6.20% for the 10th day and 6.00% for the 20th day.
