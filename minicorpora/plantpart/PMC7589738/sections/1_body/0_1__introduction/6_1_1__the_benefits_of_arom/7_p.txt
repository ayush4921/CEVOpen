0: In the study by Kokina et al.
1: in 2019 lavender and peppermint volatile oils have been shown to have the highest antioxidant capacity.
2: They combined two methods, DPPH and 2,2-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS), to increase the efficiency of the evaluation of the antioxidant activity of the volatile oils studied.
3: Volatile oils were stored for 12 months and a significant decrease in antioxidant activity was observed [ 52].
4: In the study conducted by Koksal and Gulcin in 2008 and 2010, they demonstrated that cauliflower and lintite extracts have strong antioxidant activity [ 53, 54].
5: In 2016, Aslam et al.
