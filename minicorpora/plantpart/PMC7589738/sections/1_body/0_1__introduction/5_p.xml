<p>The human immune system is very important for ensuring a normal life, which can prevent the mass spread of major health problems such as the emergence of novel viruses, like COVID-19 which has quickly become a global pandemic [

 <xref rid="B15-ijerph-17-07588" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Another substance used in treatment is Lopinavir, a protease inhibitor, and its combination with Ritonavir has demonstrated excellent results in severe acute respiratory syndrome, in the initial phase, reducing the risk of death in patients [

After infection with the new coronavirus, the human body is weakened, prone to bacterial infections, with changes in physical parameters such as increased levels of C-reactive protein, neutrophilia, leukocytosis, alveolar lung opacity, increased serum procalcitonin [

This is an attempt to find viable solutions that would lead to the prevention of contamination of the body with various viruses by increasing the body’s immunity. In doing this, the body’s immunity can be a major first step in the fight against COVID-19 but also other vectors that can act negatively on the body. We chose basil, mint, lavender and fennel plants of continuous agricultural, medical and commercial interest for this study, due to the high content of active substances and other nutrients that are beneficial to human health.
