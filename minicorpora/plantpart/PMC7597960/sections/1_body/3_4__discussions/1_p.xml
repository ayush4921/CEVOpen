 <italic>P. dioica</italic> grows in Guatemala in two northern departments inhabited by Mayan people, especially the Q’eqchi’ ethnic group characterized by high poverty indices, who use the aerial parts in traditional medicine mainly as anesthetic and as a digestive, without taking advantage of it economically [
