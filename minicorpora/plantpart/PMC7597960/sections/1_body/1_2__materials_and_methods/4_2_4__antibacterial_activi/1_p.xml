<p>The antimicrobial activity assay of the essential oil of 
 <italic>P. dioica</italic> leaves was performed using the agar diffusion method recommended by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) (Kirby–Bauer method). The assay disks (Whatman, 6 mm, 420 g/m
 <sup>2</sup>) were impregnated with 10 uL of pure essential oil and allowed to dry for 24 h. A Mueller Hinton agar was inoculated using a bacteria concentration equivalent to the MacFarland 0.5 standard, in three directions and the oil disks were arranged at equivalent distances. The boxes were incubated at 37 °C or 24 h to subsequently measure the inhibition halo in millimeters. The assays for the oils with each bacteria were carried out in triplicate [
