<p>The initial oven temperature was set at 60 °C, then raised by 3 °C/min to 246 °C and held for 20 min. He (99.999%) was used as the carrier gas with a flow rate of 1.03 mL/min; the injector temperature was set to 220 °C and a split ratio of 1:50 was used. The oils were diluted in chloroform (5 µL oil in 450 µL chloroform) and 1 µL of the dilution was injected in the chromatograph. No replicates were performed. Mass spectra were taken at 70 eV. The range values used were of 40–700
