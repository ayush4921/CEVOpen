<p>Composition analyses were performed by GC/MS using a chromatograph Shimadzu 2010 Plus system fitted with a DB5-MS capillary fused silica column (60 m, 0.25 mm I.D., 0.25 Âµm film thickness) and coupled with a SHIMADZU QP-2010 Plus selective detector (MSD). Compound identification was based on the comparison of their mass spectra with the Standard Reference Database National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 11 and of their retention indices with those compiled by Adams [
 <xref rid="B23-medicines-07-00059" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Quantitation was made on the basis of their chromatographic peak area percentages.
