<p>Viral dependent infectious diseases are a dilemma in medical sciences. Many viruses are resistant to different therapies due to their adaptable lifestyle and, therefore, the development of long-term effective antiviral chemotherapeutic agents is a very challenging task. Natural products have always been deemed the best source for isolating chemically diverse new lead molecules and served as a platform for the future development of potent and safer antiviral agents. Preliminary evidence suggested that the main peppermint oil component, menthol, might have served as natural antiviral agent and protected against

 <italic>Mentha</italic> plants is concerned, it is reported that 
 <italic>Mentha spicata</italic> and 
 <italic>Mentha spicata</italic> essential oil (MPEOs) contain some compounds acting as antiviral agents [
 <xref rid="B133-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>]. Appropriate studies showed that phenolic constituents such as rosmarinic acid, luteolin, and phytol present in the extracts of 
 <italic>Mentha spicata</italic> are effective for their antimicrobial and antiviral actions [
 <xref rid="B134-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>]. Yamasaki et al. reported that water soluble extract (16 Î¼g/mL) of 
 <italic>M. piperita</italic> exhibited strong antihuman immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV)-1 activity in MT-4 cells assay [
 <xref rid="B135-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>]. Similarly, methanolic and ethyl acetate extract of 
 <italic>M. longlifolia</italic> showed significant inhibitory effects against human HIV-1, and ethyl acetate extract exerted its anti-HIV-1 effects via inhibiting the reverse transcriptase enzyme [
 <xref rid="B136-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>]. Water-soluble (polar substances) extract of 
 <italic>M. piperita</italic> also exhibited inhibitory activity against HIV-reverse transcriptase. MPEO was also reported to have direct virucidal activity against 
 <italic>Herpes simplex</italic> virus type 1 (HSV-1) and reduced plaque formation effectively [
