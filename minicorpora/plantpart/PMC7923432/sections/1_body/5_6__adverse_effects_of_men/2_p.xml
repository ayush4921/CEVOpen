<p>Peppermint oil is contraindicated in obstruction of the bile ducts, gallbladder inflammation, and severe liver failure [
 <xref rid="B199-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">199</xref>]. The American College of Gastroenterology has recommended reducing the peppermint intake as it is a risk factor for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and lifestyle changes [

 <xref rid="B203-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">203</xref>]. Further, Zong et al. [
 <xref rid="B204-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">204</xref>] reported that peppermint essential oil, not only stimulated bile fluid secretion, but might be involved in upregulating the bile acid synthesis-related gene, cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), and the nuclear bile acid receptor FXR (farnesoid X receptor) mRNA. In addition, peppermint oil could cause heartburn or perianal irritation, bradycardia and muscle tremor, a hypersensitivity reaction, contact dermatitis, abdominal pain and jaundice in newborn babies [

Similarly, in another case report, a 40-year-old woman with no history of asthma or any other forms of allergy has shown the symptoms of dyspnea, wheezing and nasal after using menthol containing candies and toothpaste, suggesting the development of classical symptoms of asthma [

Menthol administered for 28 days at a dose level (≤ 800 mg/kg) in rats caused hepatocellular changes and pulegone (≤ 160 mg/kg) has been reported as hepatotoxic and neurotoxic. Consequently, pulegone caused weight loss, atonia, decreased blood creatinine, histopathological changes in the liver and also in the white matter of the cerebellum [
 <xref rid="B208-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">208</xref>]. Menthone (≤ 800 mg/kg orally) on the other hand, dose dependently decreased plasma creatinine, but increased alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin along with liver and spleen weight [
 <xref rid="B209-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">209</xref>]. Menthone administered to rats at a high dose over 28 days did display some signs of hepatotoxicity and cerebellar histopathology [

In a later study examining peppermint constituents for their possible induction of encephalopathy, one-month treatment with limonene (≤ 1600 mg/kg) or 1,8-cineole (1000 mg/kg) produced an accumulation of protein droplets containing α-2µ-globulin in proximal tubular epithelial cells, but no encephalopathy in rats [

 <sup>2+</sup> channel blocking properties, which might underlie their mechanism of efficacy against irritable bowel syndrome in the clinic [
 <xref rid="B200-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">200</xref>]. However, in some patients, the use of peppermint is accompanied by oral symptoms like burning mouth syndrome and oral ulceration [
 <xref rid="B203-molecules-26-01118" ref-type="bibr">203</xref>]. Also in this context, direct application of peppermint oil to the chest or nasal area of infants is not recommended due to the risk of apnea, bronchial and/or laryngeal spasms [
