<p>Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was carried out as previously described [
 <xref rid="B72-plants-09-01269" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]: Agilent Technologies HP 7890A Plus Chromatograph (Santa Clara, CA, USA), HP-5ms (30 m × 0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 μm) column, HP 5973 MSD mass detector, He carrier gas (1 mL/min), MS ionization voltage = 70 eV, emission current = 40 mA, acquisitions range = 35–350 amu, sampling rate = 1.0 scan/s. The GC operating conditions were the same as those used for GC-FID. The chemical components of the essential oils were identified based on their retention indices (RI) based on a series of 
 <italic>n</italic>-alkanes, co-injection with pure compounds when available (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) or identified essential oil components, MS library search (NIST 17 and Wiley Version 10) and by comparing with the literature MS fragmentation [
