<p>There are wide variations in essential oil compositions from the 
 <italic>Zingiber</italic> species in this study, not only between species and tissues, as expected, but also between essential oils from the same species and tissues collected from different locations. This is an important consideration if the essential oils are to be used for agricultural or medicinal uses, but also if commercialization is considered. The monoterpenes α-pinene and β-pinene seem to be largely responsible for the mosquito larvicidal activities observed. It is worth investigating whether 
 <italic>Zingiber</italic> or other essential oils rich in these components are viable alternatives for vector control. The presence of α-pinene and β-pinene cannot explain the antimicrobial activities of 
 <italic>Zingiber</italic> essential oils, and synergistic or antagonistic interactions likely contribute. Nevertheless, several 
 <italic>Zingiber</italic> essential oils have shown excellent antimicrobial activity and should be investigated further for controlling Gram-positive bacterial and yeast infections.
