<p>Multivariate analysis of the concentrations of the major components in the essential oils that were used for larvicidal activity screening (α-pinene, sabinene, β-pinene, perillene, terpinene-4-ol, neral, geranial, bornyl acetate, (
 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene, α-humulene, bicyclogermacrene, and zerumbone), along with their 24-h larvicidal activities, reveals the correlation between activity and composition. The agglomerative hierarchical cluster (AHC) analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01269-f003">Figure 3</xref>) shows a cluster of largely active essential oils (
 <italic>Z. nudicarpum</italic> rhizome, 
 <italic>Z. cornubracteatum</italic> rhizome, and 
 <italic>Z. nudicarpum</italic> leaf), along with a marginally active essential oil (
 <italic>Z. ottensii</italic> rhizome), and two less active essential oils (
 <italic>Z. recurvatum</italic> rhizome and 
 <italic>Z. neotruncatum</italic> rhizome). The concentrations of β-pinene and, to some extent, α-pinene, are largely responsible for the larvicidal activities of 
 <italic>Zingiber</italic> essential oils, as seen in the principal component analysis (PCA) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01269-f004">Figure 4</xref>). Consistent with this correlation, β-pinene has shown larvicidal activity against 
 <italic>Ae. Aegypti,</italic> with LC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranging from 12.1 to 42.5 μg/mL [
 <xref rid="B52-plants-09-01269" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. β-Pinene has also shown larvicidal activities against 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> (LC
 <sub>50</sub> of 47.33 and 42.39 μg/mL for (+)-β-pinene and (−)-β-pinene, respectively) [
 <xref rid="B53-plants-09-01269" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] and 
 <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> (LC
 <sub>50</sub> = 19.6 μg/mL) [
 <xref rid="B54-plants-09-01269" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. α-Pinene and sabinene have also shown larvicidal activity against 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> [
 <xref rid="B52-plants-09-01269" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> [

 <xref rid="B56-plants-09-01269" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], and
