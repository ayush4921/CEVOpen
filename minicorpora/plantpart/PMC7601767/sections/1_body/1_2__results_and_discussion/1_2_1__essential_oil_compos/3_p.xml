<p>The leaf essential oils of 
 <italic>Z. nudicarpum</italic> were also rich in α-pinene (5.0–10.9%), β-pinene (0.7–34.0%), in addition to the sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (
 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene (6.4–24.3%), α-humulene (2.1–6.4%), germacrene D (0.6–6.5%), and bicyclogermacrene (3.3–16.1%). The leaf essential oil of 
 <italic>Z. nudicarpum</italic> from Pù Hoạt Nature Reserve previously reported also showed α- and β-pinenes (2.4% and 11.7%, respectively) [
 <xref rid="B34-plants-09-01269" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Important differences are apparent between the previously reported essential oil and those from the present study. The previous report found no (
 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene or germacrene D, but large concentrations of cedrol (14.8%) and β-eudesmol (13.8%), which were not observed in this current study. Interestingly, the stem essential oils of 
 <italic>Z. nudicarpum</italic> showed wide variation in monoterpene hydrocarbon concentrations, with the sample from Pù Hoạt Nature Reserve showing only low concentrations of monoterpene hydrocarbons compared to samples from Nam Đông or Bạch Mã National Park. For example, the concentrations were: α-pinene (0.0, 10.6, 6.1%), β-pinene (0.5, 9.0, 5.6%), 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (0.0, 6.0, 0.1%), and limonene (0.0, 2.1, 6.0%). The Pù Hoạt stem essential oil had a high concentration of (
 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene (52.6%). The rhizome essential oil from Pù Hoạt Nature Reserve had α-pinene (18.7%) and β-pinene (58.3%) as dominant constituents, and is qualitatively similar to a sample earlier reported from that collection site [
 <xref rid="B34-plants-09-01269" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. α-Pinene and β-pinene concentrations were lower in the rhizome essential oil sample from Nam Đông (4.0% and 9.8%, respectively).
