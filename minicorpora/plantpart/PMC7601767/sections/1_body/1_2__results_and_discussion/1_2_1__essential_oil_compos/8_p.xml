 <italic>Zingiber vuquangensis</italic> leaf and rhizome essential oils were both rich in α-pinene (11.3% and 9.8%, respectively) and β-pinene (38.5% and 45.0%, respectively). The sesquiterpene hydrocarbons 
 <italic>trans</italic>-β-elemene (5.9% and 10.0%), and (
 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene (12.2% and 14.4%) were major components in the leaf and stem essential oils, respectively. The leaf, stem, and rhizome essential oils from 
 <italic>Z. vuquangensis</italic> from Vu Quang National Park, Ha Tinh Province, Vietnam, have been previously published [
 <xref rid="B46-plants-09-01269" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. A comparison of the major components is summarized in 
 <xref rid="plants-09-01269-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. Although there are qualitative similarities in the essential oil compositions from these two collections (α-pinene, β-pinene, and (
 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene are major components), there are some notable differences. Bornyl acetate and zerumbone were major components in the rhizome essential oil from the Vu Quang collection, but were not observed in the Pù Hoạt sample; 
 <italic>trans</italic>-β-elemene was observed in relatively small concentrations in the sample from Vu Quang, but was a major component in the leaf and stem essential oils from Pù Hoạt. The differences in chemical composition can be attributed to the geographical locations of the two collections and/or the season when the samples were collected. The Vu Quang sample was collected in August, 2014 (rainy season), while the Pù Hoạt sample was collected in April, 2019 (dry season).
