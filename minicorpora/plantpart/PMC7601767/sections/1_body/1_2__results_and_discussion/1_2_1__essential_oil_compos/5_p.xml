<p>Camphene (40.4%) dominated the rhizome essential oil composition of 
 <italic>Z. nitens</italic>, followed by bornyl acetate (14.5%), (
 <italic>E</italic>)-β-ocimene (12.7%), and α-pinene (10.5%). In comparison, the rhizome essential oil of 
 <italic>Z. nitens</italic> from Pù Mát National Park previously reported contained bornyl acetate (11.8%), (
 <italic>E</italic>)-β-ocimene (1.1%), and α-pinene (7.3%), along with β-pinene (21.0%), and δ-elemene (12.8%) [
 <xref rid="B31-plants-09-01269" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In contrast, the leaf essential oil of 
 <italic>Z. nitens</italic> was composed largely of α-zingiberene (17.4%), α-pinene (11.2%), β-sesquiphellandrene (10.1%), (
 <italic>E</italic>)-nerolidol (10.0%), zingiberenol (7.2%), β-pinene (6.0%), and 
 <italic>ar</italic>-curcumene (5.2%). The previously reported 
 <italic>Z. nitens</italic> leaf essential oil was devoid of α-zingiberene, β-sesquiphellandrene, zingiberenol, and 
 <italic>ar</italic>-curcumene, but contained large concentrations of δ-elemene (17.0%) and ledol (8.1%), which were not observed in the present sample. In addition, concentrations of 
 <italic>trans</italic>-β-elemene, germacrene D, and bicyclogermacrene were high in the previous report (8.8%, 8.2%, and 8.3%, respectively), but low in the present sample (0.8%, 0.7%, and 1.5%, respectively). The variations in chemical constituents can likely be attributed to the different geographical collection sites as well as climatic factors. The Pù Mát sample was collected in May, 2014 (beginning of the rainy season), while the sample from Vũ Quang National Park (this work) was collected in September, 2018 (height of the rainy season).
