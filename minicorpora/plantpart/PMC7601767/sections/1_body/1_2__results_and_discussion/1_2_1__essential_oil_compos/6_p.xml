<p>The essential oil from the leaves of 
 <italic>Z. ottensii</italic> had abundant sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, including (

 <italic>trans</italic>-β-elemene (17.0%), along with the monoterpene β-pinene (17.1%). (
 <italic>E</italic>)-Caryophyllene (19.6%) and 
 <italic>trans</italic>-β-elemene (12.3%) were also found to be key constituents in 
 <italic>Z. ottensii</italic> leaf oil from Bandung, West Java, Indonesia [
 <xref rid="B41-plants-09-01269" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. However, zerumbone was a major component (11.4%) in the leaf oil from Indonesia, but was not detected in the sample from Vietnam. The rhizome essential oil from Vietnam had monoterpenes as the major components, such as sabinene (21.6%), β-pinene (11.7%), γ-terpinene (5.5%), and terpinen-4-ol (17.1%), in addition to the sesquiterpenoid zerumbone (12.5%). Rhizome essential oils of 
 <italic>Z. ottensii</italic> from other geographical locations have been reported; the major components are presented in 
 <xref rid="plants-09-01269-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. A hierarchical cluster analysis using the eight major constituents (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01269-f002">Figure 2</xref>) reveals the similarities between these rhizome essential oils. The clusters are largely defined by the zerumbone concentrations.
