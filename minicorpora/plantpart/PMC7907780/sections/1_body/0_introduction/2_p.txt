0: Cold-pressed oils are oils obtained by passing plant materials through a screw press or hydraulic press with zero chemicals and no heat treatment, resulting in plant lipophilic extract with high retention of their color, flavor, and nutritive properties and minimum degradation of the functional components [ 1,  2].
1: In general, cold-pressed oils contain better nutritional value than commercially refined oils because the chemical and thermal treatments in the refining process such as solvent extraction, degumming, neutralizing with NaOH, bleaching, dewaxing and deodorizing can cause degradation and reduction of some essential compounds as a consequence [ 3].
2: For instance, sunflower oil could lose up to 60% phytosterols, up to 55% tocols and up to 60% squalene due to the refining procedure as reported in a study by Gotor and Rhazi [ 4].
3: Refining process could increase the acid value, peroxide value and  p-anisidine value in rapeseed oil, together with the diminished content of tocopherols, sterols, -carotene and phenols as previously evidenced [ 5].
4: In addition, phytosterols are progressively lost during refining while continuously altering the ratio of free and esterified sterols [ 6].
