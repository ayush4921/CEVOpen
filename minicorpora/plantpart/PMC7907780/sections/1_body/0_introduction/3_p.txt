0: From the perspective of functional compounds, cold-pressed oils are considered as one of the healthiest chemicals-free products commercially available.
1: Lipophilic phytochemicals present in cold-pressed oils such as phytosterols, squalene, and cholecalciferol have been demonstrated to improve physiological and biological activity in human health.
2: Phytosterols have displayed their abilities to reduce the level of cholesterol in the blood, increase metabolic rates, enhance fat burning, and reduce the incidence of some types of cancers [ 7].
3: Squalene has some favourable health benefits such as cancer inhibitor, antitumor, antioxidant in the skin, and has been applied in pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries.
4: Cholecalciferol helps regulate and control absorbability of phosphorus and calcium, and, furthermore, it is an effective compound for managing blood sugar levels, thereby controlling diabetic conditions [ 8,  9].
5: In addition, nutritional value of plant oils is also evaluated by the amount of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) [ 10].
6: Oils rich in MUFAs, such as oleic acid (C18:1), had the potential to lower blood cholesterol levels and reduce the aortic accumulation of oxidized LDL without adversely affecting HDL fraction [ 11,  12].
7: PUFAs are essential for the human health and can only be received from a proper diet.
8: The benefits of linoleic acid (C18:2) have been evidenced for cholesterol and triglyceride lowering effects, anti-inflammation, cardioprotection, antidiabetes, and cancer prevention [ 13].
9: Meanwhile, linolenic acid (C18:3) has been known for its anti-inflammatory, anti-hypertensive, anti-thrombotic activities, and anticancer activities [ 14].
