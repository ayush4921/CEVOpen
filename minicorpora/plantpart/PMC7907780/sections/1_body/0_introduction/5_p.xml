<p id="p0025">Therefore, this study is aimed at screening some potential cold-pressed oils with good nutritional properties by preparing a number of cold-pressed oils from various plant materials (total of 50 samples) and analyzing their chemical composition using chromatographic methods. Fatty acid compositions were quantitatively analyzed using gas-chromatography mass-spectrometry (GC-MS). Functional phytochemicals, including phytosterols (3 forms), squalene, and cholecalciferol were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a diode array detector (HPLC-DAD). Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to identify the significance of oil categories that share chemical similarity to the content of functional compounds and fatty acid composition. In some previous studies, PCA was successfully used to produce a clustering of variables and samples into distinct groups of oil samples such as the variation of fatty acid data on different soybean cultivars [

The obtained quantitative data would be useful in the selection of plant materials for cold-press oil production or related applications for therapeutic and health purposes.
