<p id="p0140">Plant sterols, generally known as phytosterols, have gained much attention in reducing the serum cholesterol level in humans, as well as the risk of heart disease. In addition, phytosterols have anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, and anti-tumor properties [
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Considering phytosterols content (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B), the oils from marrow seeds and legumes were of the highest values (8693 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup> and 5565 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup> respectively) with an average content of 3903 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup>. The oils from leafy green seeds were lowest in phytosterols (1688 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup>). Regarding individual oil, the oils rich in phytosterols were wax gourd seed oil (15123 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup>), winter melon seed oil (13138 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup>), and watermelon seed oil (11012 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup>). In this study, β-sitosterol, campesterol, and stigmasterol were analyzed because they are the most abundant form in nature. In general, β-sitosterol is more abundant than stigmasterol and campesterol. Among the samples analyzed, the highest β-sitosterol content was detected in wax gourd seed oil (14630 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup>), winter melon seed oil (11908 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup>), and watermelon seed oil (10408 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup>). All of them were subcategorized in marrow seed oils suggesting a close relationship between their chemical composition (phytosterols) and taxonomy. However, stigmasterol and campesterol were found relatively high in soybean oil (1870 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup>) and winter melon seed oil (1230 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup>) (

 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], who reported the phytosterol content of soybean oil ranging between 2350 and 4050 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup> that were comprised of β-sitosterol for 1250–2360 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup>, campesterol for 620–1310 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup>, and stigmasterol for 470–770 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup>.
