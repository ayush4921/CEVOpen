<p id="p0155">The content of functional phytochemicals derived from this study was compared with those reported in the literature of cold-pressed oil [
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. On the contrary to fatty acid composition, the obtained phytochemical content was rather different than that reported in the literature. Regarding phytosterol content, sesame oil had comparable amount of β-sitosterol (ours was 1768–2192 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup> and that of the literature was 1900–2600 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup>) and campesterol together with stigmasterol (ours was 74–200 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup> and that of the literature was 310–420 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup>). Total phytosterol content in amaranth oils (2213–2336 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup>), chia seed oils (3684–3903 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup>), pistachio oil (1200 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup>), and coriander oil (3029 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup>) were lower than those reported in the literature (19300, 6653–7765, 5586 and 9180 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively). However, the phytosterol content in sunflower seed oil (3000 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup>), pumpkin seed oil (6738 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup>), hazenut oil (6062 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup>), peanut oil (5368 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup>), moringa seed oil (2650 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup>), walnut oil (2479 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup>), soybean oil (5070 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup>), macadamia oil (2400 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup>) and muskmelon seed oil (8845 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup>) were greater than those reported in the literature (2400–2600, 1806, 1096, 220–1200, 1344, 1236, 2970, 740 and 3250 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively). On the other hand, squalene content in the obtained cold-pressed oils were compared with those reported in the literature. Squalene content in sunflower seed oil (1537 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup>), hazelnut oil (2356 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup>) and macadamia oil (549 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup>) was greater than those previously reported (150–200, 186 and 23 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively), while squalene content in pumpkin seed oil (516 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup>) was lower than that in the literature (3520 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup>). Since the analyzed functional phytochemicals are secondary metabolites in plants, they can be easily influenced by the type, variety, and environmental conditions, including fertilizers, farm management, harvesting conditions, and agroclimatic properties [
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. For instance, a study by Roche et al. [
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] showed a large variability of phytosterol among sixteen sunflower inbred lines and hybrids (1780–3040 ppm). A delay of sowing and increased temperatures during seed formation could improve the sterol content by up to 35%. Therefore, in order to obtain high quality plant oils, breeding programs as well as cultivation conditions of the plant should be carefully considered and manipulated.
