 <sup>−1</sup>, in which an average content was 5402 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup>. As a result, oils from marrow seeds had the highest content of all the active compounds (19933 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup>), and was 368.99% higher than the average value. Among the marrow seed oils analyzed, the oils that had the highest amount of bioactive compounds were winter melon (19933 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup>), wax gourd (17904 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup>), and watermelon (14294 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup>). Oils from pseudo-cereals and legumes were also relatively high in the total content (comparable to 178.69 % and 147.06% of the average value, respectively) compared to those of the other categories. Since the functional phytochemicals are comprised of many chemical compounds that are diversified in structures and physiological roles, each group of compounds was then discussed for its content and availability among oil samples. Average contents of each specific compounds among categories of oils were compared and exhibited in
