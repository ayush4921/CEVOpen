<p id="p0145">Squalene is a hydrocarbon intermediate in the biosynthesis of phytosterols in plants, and it is widely used for applications such as skin moisturizers, vaccines or carriers for active lipophilic molecules [
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In this study, squalene was detected in the range of 265–5979 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup>. The high amount of squalene was found in marrow seed and pseudo-cereals oils, in which the oils from winter melon seeds (5979 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup>), hairy basil seeds (5868 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup>), and black chia seeds (5625 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup>) had the greatest amount of squalene (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>C). On the other hand, squalene was least found in oils of leafy green seeds (403 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup>). However, there is a report by Bozorov et al. [
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] claiming that squalene content in oils obtained by extraction is greater than that obtained by cold-pressing. This implies that squalene content in the sample oils might be increased if extraction solvent were employed for extraction. However, it seems that many studies have emphasized that the quantitation of plant squalene is mostly done from materials rather than oils. For example, Ryan et al. [
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] studied the content of squalene from some selected plant materials such as seeds, grains, and legumes, and found that pumpkin seed was the most abundant source of squalene (as high as 890 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup>). The results contradict with ours because in our study oils obtained from grains and legume (such as sesame, soybean and peanut) contained higher amount of squalene than those of pumpkin. The difference would be partly due to difference in samples (grain versus oil) and in extraction efficiency of two different methods (solvent extraction versus cold pressing).
