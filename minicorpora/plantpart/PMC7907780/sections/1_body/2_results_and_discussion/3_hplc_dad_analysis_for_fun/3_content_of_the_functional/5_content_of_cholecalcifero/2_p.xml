<p id="p0150">Cholecalciferol, also known as vitamin D
 <sub>3</sub>, is an important nutrient for calcium homeostasis and optimal bone health. It is found in some foods and can be taken to prevent vitamin D deficiency and related diseases, including altered phosphorus metabolism which could lead to renal osteodystrophy and increased mortality due to cardiovascular disease [

 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>D, the oils from marrow seeds had remarkably high content of cholecalciferol as 471.60 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup>, and an average value of 153.30 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup>. The oils rich in cholecalciferol were angled loofha seed oil (1287.75 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup>), winter melon seed oil (815.99 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup>), and long skinny eggplant seed oil (632.14 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup>). Cholecalciferol in the other groups were in range of non-detectable to 650.30 μg g
 <sup>−1</sup>. Although there have been some reports evidencing vitamin D precursors and metabolites in plants [
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], to our understanding this is the first study to report high contents of cholecalciferol in marrow seed oils, suggesting marrow seeds to be another good source of vitamin D from foods.
