<p id="p0130">In this study, HPLC-DAD was employed to separate and quantify some functional compounds in the fifty plant oils. Chromatographic results are shown in 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>. Functional phytochemicals were eluted as cholecalciferol (6.33 min), stigmasterol and campesterol (9.92 min), β-sitosterol (10.97 min), and squalene (14.42 min). All targeted compounds were successfully separated within 30 min. The chromatographic result has reconfirmed effectiveness and separatability of the reverse-phase column with pentafluorophenyl phase (PFP) for quantification of lipophilic compounds in cold-pressed vegetable oil samples as previously reported [
