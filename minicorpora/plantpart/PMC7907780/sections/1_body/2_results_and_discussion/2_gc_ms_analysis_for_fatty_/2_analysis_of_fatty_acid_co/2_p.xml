<p id="p0095">GC-MS chromatograms of FAMEs in some cold-pressed oils are shown in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. Using the method, good separation of FAMEs was obtained as methyl palmitoleate (FAME of palmitoleic acid) was eluted at 7.51 min, methyl palmitate (of palmitic acid) at 7.85 min, methyl linoleate (of linoleic acid) at 10.89 min, methyl oleate (of oleic acid) at 10.98 min, methyl linolenate (of linolenic acid) at 11.04 min, methyl stearate (of stearic acid) at 11.46 min, methyl arachidate (of arachidic acid) at 15.31 min, and methyl erucate (of erucic acid) at 18.75 min. Mass spectra of the detected FAMEs and information of their major fragmented ions were exhibited in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>. According to 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, composition of the fatty acids differed among samples. For example, black chia seed oil contained palmitic, linoleic, oleic, linolinic, stearic, and arachidic acids whilst false Pak Choi (Phukeaw) had palmitic, linoleic, oleic, stearic, erucic and arachidic acids. The result showed that a single run of FAME analysis required only 22 min, suggesting the present method suitable for FAME analysis of a large number of oil samples.
