<p id="p0100">The fatty acid compositions of the various oil samples are presented in 
 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. The fatty acids were found in ranges from nondetectable to 13.38% for palmitoleic acid (average of 3.52%), 6.08–33.50% for palmitic acid (average of 15.63%), nondetectable to 60.33% for linoleic acid (average of 25.85%), 8.91–78.21% for oleic acid (average of 27.31%), nondetectable to 56.68% for linolenic acid (average of 40.66%), nondetectable to 10.77% for stearic acid (average of 2.96%), nondetectable to 4.90% for arachidic acid (average of 0.28%), and nondetectable to 54.72 % for erucic acid (average of 27.00%). Among the fatty acids observed, the major species were palmitic, oleic, linoleic, and linolenic acids. The minor fatty acids were palmitoleic, stearic, arachidic, and erucic acids that were found only in some plant oils. For instance, palmitoleic acid were detected only in 6 plant oils such as macadamia, moringa, pistachio, black sesame, white sesame, and peanut oils. Linolenic acid was mainly found in pseudo-cereal oils and legume oils such as brown flaxseed, perilla and inca peanut oils. Arachidic acid was mostly found in pseudo-cereal and amaranth oils but with relatively low amount of less than 1.00%.
