<p id="p0120">Regarding applications of plant oils for health purposes, cold-pressing has demonstrated to yield oils with higher amount of unsaturated fatty acids compared with the oils derived from other preparation methods as reported previously [
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. A study by Ozcan etÂ al. [
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] presented that the moringa seed oil obtained from cold-pressing had greater amount of saturated fatty acids (75.49% oleic acid, 1.69% linoleic acid, and 1.87% linolenic acid) than that derived from soxhlet system (73.83, 1.27, and 1.73%, respectively). In a study of chia seed oil, cold-pressing could yield oil with higher content of linolenic acid (67.89%) and linoleic acid (19.07%) compared with the oil obtained from solvent extraction (67.87% and 17.63%, respectively) [
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Walnut oil obtained by cold-pressing had higher oleic acid content (28.30%) than the oil from supercritical CO
 <sub>2</sub> extraction (23.50%) [
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. A number of studies reported that oils extracted by cold-pressing contained a composition of palmitic acid lower that those derived from other extraction methods [
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Those findings suggest that with the same plant material being used cold-pressing is an alternative method for oil extraction with higher unsaturated fatty acid and lower saturated fatty acid.
