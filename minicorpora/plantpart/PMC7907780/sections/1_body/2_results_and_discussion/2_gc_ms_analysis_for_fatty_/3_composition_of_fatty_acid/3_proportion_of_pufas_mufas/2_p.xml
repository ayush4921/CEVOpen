<p id="p0105">In this study, all the oil samples had a large proportion of PUFAs (10.14–62.98%) and MUFAs (22.77–67.34%) but relatively small proportion of SFAs (14.25–26.62%). 
 <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> shows compositional percentage of saturated fatty acids (SFAs, including palmitic, stearic, and arachidic acids), MUFAs (including palmitoleic, oleic, and erucic acids), and PUFAs (including linoleic and linolenic acids) in the oil samples. Oils from pseudo-cereals and legumes contained relatively low amount of SFAs as 14.25 and 15.64%, respectively. The oils from pseudo-cereals consisted of high amount of unsaturated fatty acids, especially PUFAs (62.98%), while the oils from kernel, cruciferous seeds, and leafy green seeds were rich in MUFAs (55.68–67.34 %). The oils from amaranth and marrow seeds were comparable in ratios of SFAs: MUFAs: PUFAs (
 <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). The oils from kernel, cruciferous seeds, and leafy green seeds tended to have MUFAs (55.68–67.34%) &gt; PUFAs (10.14–24.69%), but the oils from pseudo-cereal, legumes, amaranths, and marrow seeds had PUFAs (47.23–62.98%) &gt; MUFAs (22.77–31.41%). The UFAs and SFAs ratio of the oil can be used in selection of appropriate oil for the specific application. For instance, oils used for deep-frying should have high content of SFAs that is likely to be more stable when heated. Besides the degree of unsaturation, the types of predominant fatty acids were compared (
 <xref rid="tbl6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). The major fatty acids observed in the sample oils were palmitic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid and linolenic acid. Linolenic acid was abundant in pseudo-cereal oils (33.98%). Linoleic acid was found rich in amaranth and marrow seed oils (49.46% and 47.23%, respectively). The oils from kernels were great in oleic acid (C18:1) as 50.41%. The minor fatty acids were stearic acid, arachidic acid, palmitoleic acid and erucic acid. Although some minor fatty acids were present in small amounts, it may bear some significant health effect. For instance, erucic acid that were greatly found in cruciferous and leafy green seed oils have been evidenced for it adverse health effects against human organs such as the heart (myocardial lipidosis) [
