<p id="p0115">The fatty acid profiles obtained in this study was compared with some of the same cold-pressed oils that had been reported in the literature [
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In general, the content of fatty acid profiles from our results was comparable with those in the literature. The oils with both predominant polyunsaturated linoleic acid and monounsaturated oleic acid were sesame oils (our contents were 49.43–50.62% and 30.06–32.34 %, when the literature showed 46.20% and 38.80% of linoleic acid and oleic acid, respectively), amaranth oils (ours were 44.12–59.24% and 24.14–27.07%, while those of the literature were 40.10–47.30% and 24.50–31.30%), pistachio oil (ours were 40.26% and 43.97%, when those of the literature were 31.33% and 54.59%), and peanut oil (ours were 33.08% and 47.60%, when those of the literature were 20.40–39.10% and 35.70–55.30%). The oils rich in oleic acid were moringa seed oil (our oleic acid content as 78.21%, and that of the literature as 67.65–79.58%), hazelnut oil (ours as 73.19% and that of the literature as 79.30%), coriander seed oil (ours as 50.87% and that of the literature as 65.00–70.00%), and macadamia oil (ours as 58.69% and that of the literature as 54.60–63.40%). The oils with major linoleic acid were sunflower seed oil (our linoleic acid content as 59.32%, and that of the literature as 48.00–75.00%), muskmelon seed oil (our content as 59.79%, and that of the literature as 59.20%), soybean oil (our content as 50.31%, and that of the literature as 50.80–55.20%), walnut oil (our content as 47.19%, and that of the literature as 54.60–60.80%), and pumpkin seed oil (our result as 41.53%, and that of the literature as 16.01–37.10%). Finally, the oils especially rich in linolenic acid were chia seed oil (our linolenic acid content as 46.59–49.61%, and that of the literature as 64.00%), and flaxseed oil (our content as 51.22–56.68%, and that of the literature as 54.77%).
