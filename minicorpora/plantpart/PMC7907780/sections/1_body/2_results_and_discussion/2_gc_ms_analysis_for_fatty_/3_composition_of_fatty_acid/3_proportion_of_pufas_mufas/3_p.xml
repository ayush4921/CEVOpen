<p id="p0110">Furthermore, all cold-pressed oils were individually assessed for health benefits based on their major fatty acid composition (
 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Considering legume oils, linolenic acid was found highest in Inca peanut oil (43.42%), and linoleic acid in soybean oil (50.31%). Peanut oil was highest in oleic acid (47.60%). The group of pseudo-cereal oils were relatively high in PUFAs (26.66–78.25%), in which linolenic acid was found highest in brown flaxseed oil (56.68%), and highest linoleic acid in black sesame oil (50.62%). The highest oleic acid was observed in coriander oil (50.86%). In the group of kernel oils, PUFAs was rather low when compared with the two previous groups. The observed PUFA was only linolenic acid in walnut oil (10.73%), but MUFAs were quite abundant as oleic acid content for moringa seed oil and hazelnut oil was 78.21% and 73.19%, respectively. The oils from amaranth and marrow seeds had a comparable decent amount of linoleic acid (39.17–59.24%), but oleic acid was found higher in amaranth oils (24.14–27.07%) than marrow seed oils (8.91–25.39%). In contrast, oils from subcategories of cruciferous seeds and leafy green seeds tended to have mediocre profile of PUFAs (nondetectable-30.35%) except lettuce seed oil (linoleic acid as 60.33%). Erucic acid (C22:1) was observed as a predominat fatty acid in this groups, in which the oils from Chinese mustard seeds, Chinese cabbage seeds, broccoli seeds and false Pak Choi (Inthanon) seeds contained more than 50% of their fatty acid composition.
