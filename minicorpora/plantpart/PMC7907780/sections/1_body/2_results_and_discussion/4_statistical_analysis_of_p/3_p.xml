<p id="p0165">Taken together, oil samples were evaluated in terms of both fatty acid composition and functional phytochemicals. In this work, superior oils refer to oils that contain larger fraction of unsaturated fatty acids and high amount of those functional compounds. Accordingly, characteristics of oils from different categories of plants are summarized. Marrow seed oils are a good source of total bioactive, phytosterol, cholecalciferol and linoleic acid, in which winter melon seed oil and wax gourd seed oil are the most preferable ones. Pseudo-cereal oils are superior oils for high squalene and linolenic acid content, where perilla oil and hairy basil oil are the lead in this group. Legume oils are rich in phytosterols, where peanut oil, as well as soybean oil, are a good choice in this group. In contrast, oils from kernel, amaranth, cruciferous seeds, and leafy green seeds are rather moderate or inferior when considering the amounts of unsaturated fatty acids and the targets bioactive compounds present.</p>
