<p id="p0170">On the basis of the result from this study, some plant oil materials are suggested to be a good source for oil extraction with high nutritional value regarding fatty acid composition and functional phytochemicals. However, quality and stability of oil is another aspect to be concerned with, considering human consumption. If the oil is inappropriately prepared, handled and stored, its quality is diminished. For instance, triacylglycerol in oil can be hydrolyzed under improper circumstance, yielding free fatty acids and glycerol which can increase the rancidity of the oil. The oils with rancidity and off-flavor can be toxic and ultimately pose health risks. In general, quality and stability of oil can be accessed by mean of chemical properties including peroxide value (PV), acid value (AV), and oxidative stability index (OSI). The parameters are subjected to be studied together with optimization of oil extraction after plant oil materials are selected for further application.</p>
