<p id="p0160">PCA was applied after the data was pretreated by standardization to exploratorily analyze the pattern in the oil samples. 
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> demonstrates the PCA score plots where the samples were labeled according to the categories of oils. It was observed that the plant oil samples from the same categories were located nearby each other. For example, most of the samples from pseudo-cereal oil were found on the lower side of the PCA space. The samples from the categories of marrow seed oil had higher PC2 scores, and tended to locate on the upper part of the score plots. A dense cluster on the middle right area of the PCA space were plots of samples from legume oils, amaranth oils, pseudo-cereal oils, and cruciferous and leafy green seed oils. The plots of the pseudo-cereal oils are quite distinct that some plots are distributed outside the main cluster, which is located around the middle low of the PCA plot. For instance, the plots of coriander seed oil (coded 13), black sesame oil (coded 11), and white sesame oil (coded 18) are scattered because these oils did not contain linolenic acid. Black sesame oil contained the highest content of linoleic acid and cholecalciferol in their group. White sesame oil was found high content of linoleic and oleic acids, and the coriander seed oil had very high cholecalciferol content and the highest content of oleic acid. Samples in a category of nut/kernel oil had a relatively high and wide range of oleic acid content as 24.02–78.21%, contributing to the dispersion of some plots from this group. Most of the plots from cruciferous seed oils and leafy green seed oils are found in the middle right area of the PCA space. This might be partly because the oils from these two groups contain rather a high composition of oleic and erucic acids. The latter was also found in some kernel oils including coconut and macadamia oils. The plots of amaranth oils are distributed in the same area of legume oils, which share the same range of oleic and linoleic acids content. For the cluster of samples from marrow seed oils, a group with relatively high contents of phytosterols and cholecalciferol, a lot of dispersion in PCA plot is observed because wax gourd seed oil (coded 30) and winter melon seed oil (coded 31) contained the highest amount of phytosterols. Their plots are scattered to the upper right area of the PCA plot. The PCA plot (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>) suggests a similarity pattern for the analyzed samples that would be useful in performed to highlighting the dissimilarity of the oil profiles and PCA can clearly distinguish between different categories of plant material in cold-pressed oil.
