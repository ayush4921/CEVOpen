<p id="p0075">For GC-MS analysis of fatty acid composition, the fatty acids in oil samples were converted to fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) according to the method of Ichihara and Fukubayashi [
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] before analysis. Briefly, oil samples (0.015 g) were mixed with 0.20 mL of toluene, 1.50 mL of methanol and 0.30 mL of 8.0% (w/v) concentrated hydrochloric acid. The mixture was incubated at 100 °C for 5 min. Then, 1.00 mL of hexane and 1.00 mL of water was added and mixed with the mixture. The hexane layer (upper layer) was separated for analysis. Fatty acid composition in oil samples was analyzed using a 6890 GC/5973 MSD (Agilent, Polo Alto, CA). A HP-5MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm) was used, and helium as carrier gas was flowed at 1 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup>. The energy of electron impact was 70 eV. The inlet temperature was 280 °C, and injection volume was 1.0 μL with a split ratio of 15:1. The column temperature was set at 165 °C, followed by a 4 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup> oven temperature ramped to 290 °C. The transfer line temperature was 290 °C, and the ion-source temperatures were MS Quad 150 °C, and MS source 230 °C, respectively. The scanned mass range was 29–550 
 <italic>m/z</italic>, and the detector voltage was set at 1150 V. Identification of the detected components was performed by matching their mass spectra with the reference spectra in NIST 98 Mass Spectral Library and comparing retention times with their standards. The constructed calibration curves for FAMEs of the fatty acids as well as method validation parameters are shown in
