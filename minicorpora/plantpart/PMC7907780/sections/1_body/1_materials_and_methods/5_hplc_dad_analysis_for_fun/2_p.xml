<p id="p0080">For HPLC analysis, oil samples were pre-treated with non-saponification process since saponification can significantly degrade compounds due to high temperature, alkali condition, and its multi-step procedure as evidenced by many studies [

 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. A portion of oil (0.5 g) was diluted with dichloromethane to make a final volume of 1.00 mL. The resulting solution was filtered through a 0.45 μm syringe nylon filter before HPLC injection. Analysis of phytosterols, squalene and cholecalciferol in oil samples were separated and quantified using a modified method of Pokkanta et al. [
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. An HPLC system consisted of an Agilent HPLC 1100 connected to a diode array detector (Model G1315 A, Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto). A Kinetex PFP column (4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μm, Phenomenex, Inc., CA) was used as an analytical column. The mobile phases used were methanol (as component A) and water (as component B) operating in a gradient mode. The elution gradient was 90% A (0.0–13.0 min), 90–95% A (13.0–14.0 min), 95 to 85% A (14.0–17.0 min), 85–95% A (17.0–22.0 min), and 95% A (22.0–30.0 min). The column temperature was set at 30 °C, and the flow rate was 1.0 mL min
