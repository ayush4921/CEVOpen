<p id="p0035">Plant oils were extracted by cold-pressing from different plant parts of the plant material, specifically those which could yield oil. All plant materials were purchased and collected from the agricultural areas in Chiang Mai province (the Northern Thailand, latitudinally and longitudinally extended by 18

 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Oils derived from those plant samples were classifieds into 3 main categories, including nut oils, grain oils, and vegetable oils. In the category of nut oils, plant materials were mostly kernel parts (9 samples). In the category of grain oils, subcategories were pseudo-cereals (9 samples), legumes (3 samples) and amaranth (3 samples). The category of vegetable oils contained subcategories of marrow, cruciferous and leafy green seeds (8, 7, and 11 samples, respectively). Before oil extraction, the plant samples were kept in zip-lock bags and stored at or below 4 °C in a refrigerator. In the preparation of oil from plant raw materials, each plant material has different processes depending on the plant type such as peeling, sun-drying, roasting, grinding, extraction, and bottling as shown in
