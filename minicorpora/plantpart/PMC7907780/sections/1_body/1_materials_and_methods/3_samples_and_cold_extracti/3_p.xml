<p id="p0070">The cold-press process was operated with a home automatic oil press machine (1500 W, General Equipment Co., Ltd. (Guangzhou, China)). The small or ground plant materials were put into the feeding part, allowing the materials to be pressed with a spiral screw in an extraction cylinder. The screw pressing was continuously driven by a motor, yielding oil as a result of high-pressure pressing and dry solid cake which the oil was excluded. The cold extraction occurred at a temperature of 40–50 °C, and the sample mass of each extraction in this study was between 500-1000 g of each plant material.</p>
