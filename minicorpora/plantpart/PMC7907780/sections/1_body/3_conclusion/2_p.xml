<p id="p0235">In summary, total fifty different cold-pressed oils were prepared in this study. The oils were analyzed for their fatty acid composition and the functional compounds using GC-MS and HPLC-DAD, respectively. The two chromatographic techniques allowed a good separation and quantification of the targeted compounds. A great diversification of fatty acid composition and bioactive compounds was demonstrated. Most oils had the greatest proportion of PUFAs, followed by SFAs and MUFAs, respectively. Considering the bioactive compounds, phytosterols were found in the highest amount, followed by squalene, and cholecalciferol, respectively. PCA was also performed to analyze the variation in identified cold-pressed oil profiles and it can be used to group oil with similar composition. Oils from marrow seeds, pseudo-cereals, and legumes tended to have superior chemical properties compared to oils from kernel, amaranth, cruciferous seeds, and leafy green seeds. In conclusion, the qualitative and quantitative data would be useful for application or selection of those plant oils in food and pharmaceutical industries.</p>
