0: Insects such as  Callosobruchus maculatus (Fabr.)
1: (bruchid beetle),  Sitophilus granarius (L.) (wheat weevil),  S. oryzae (L.) (rice weevil),  S. zeamais (Motsch.)
2: (maize weevil), and  Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) (red flour beetle), are important pests that attack stored grains, causing widespread economic losses [ 1, 2, 3].
3: The long-term use of synthetic insecticides to control these pests has become problematic, however.
4: Compounds such as chlorinated hydrocarbons, organophosphates, carbamates, etc., tend to be toxic to non-target organisms such as mammals, birds, and fish [ 4, 5, 6], they are persistent in the environment [ 7, 8, 9, 10], and many stored-grain insect pests have developed insecticide resistance [ 11, 12, 13].
5: Essential oils have emerged as viable alternatives to synthetic pesticides for control of stored-grain insect pests; they are generally non-toxic to mammals, birds, fish, or humans, have limited persistence, are readily biodegradable, and are renewable resources [ 14, 15, 16, 17].
