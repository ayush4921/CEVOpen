 <italic>Launaea taraxacifolia</italic> (Willd.) Amin ex. C. Jeffrey (syn. 
 <italic>Lactuca taraxacifolia</italic> (Willd.) Schumach, wild lettuce) is a leafy vegetable plant belonging to the Asteraceae (Compositae). The family consists of roughly 1100 genera, and 20,000 species distributed across several countries including Mexico, West Indies, Central and South America, Europe, North Africa, and tropical West African countries like Ghana, Senegal, Benin, and Nigeria [

 <italic>L. taraxacifolia</italic> is a wild erect perennial herb that grows up to 1–3 m in height with 3−5 pinnately lobed leaves at the base of the stem in a rosette form. The plant is found singly or in clusters of rocky soil, but it is also cultivated in small open gardens near homes for family consumption. The leaves are eaten fresh as a salad or cooked as sauces [

The plant is known as ‘efo yanrin’ among the Yorubas of the southwestern part of Nigeria, ‘ugu’ among the Ibos of the eastern part of Nigeria, and ‘nonon barya’ among the Hausas of the northern part of Nigeria. Minerals, proteins, flavonoids, fatty acids, and vitamins have been reported to be found in the leaves of

 <italic>L. taraxacifolia</italic>. Therefore, the present research was undertaken with the aim of investigating the essential oil composition and evaluating the insecticidal potential of 
 <italic>L. taraxacifolia</italic> leaves from southwestern Nigeria.
