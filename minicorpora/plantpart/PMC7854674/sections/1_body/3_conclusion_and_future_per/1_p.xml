<p id="Par34">The results of the present research have proven the bioremediation potential of a new combined application treatment (pyrochar and thermal desorption) technique, for crude oil contamination which also showed significant growth potential for the lettuce plants. It enhanced the morphological, physiological, and biochemical parameters of the plant. Pyrochar and thermal pyrolysis treatments, alone, had their limitations in terms of slow degradation rates and less efficiency in plant growth, respectively. However, combined application treatment application proved effective in both processes and hence can be used at a larger scale on soils where crude oil pollution is a serious problem particularly for agricultural production.</p>
