 </sup>. Excised leaves were inserted in the specimen holder of the pressure vessel of the instrument. The pressure was gradually built up within the pressure vessel until the sap started to ooze out from the exposed cut end of the leaf. Reading at this point corresponded to the negative force with which the water was held within that leaf sample. It was noted and expressed inâ€”MPa.
