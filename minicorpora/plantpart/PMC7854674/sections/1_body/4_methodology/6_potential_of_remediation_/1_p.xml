<p id="Par44">A pot experiment was conducted in the greenhouse of the Botany Department, PMAS- AAUR, Rawalpindi. A complete randomized design (CRD) was applied with three replications. Treatments were the same as described in the above section. Seven sterilized seeds of each variety were sown per pot which was later thinned. Plants were harvested after 45 days of sowing. Fresh and dry biomass was recorded. Leaf area was measured with the help of a leaf area meter. All the samples were collected in zipper bags and stored at − 20 °C freezer for further biochemical assays. In morphological parameters root length, shoot length, shoot fresh/dry weight, root fresh/dry weight, and leaf area were analysed.</p>
