<p id="Par36">Pyrochar was produced by pyrolysis of sawdust and shavings (
 <italic>Dalbergia sisso</italic> L.) collected from the local market. These were air-dried and pyrolyzed at 350 °C in a muffle furnace, then grounded and was passed through a sieve of 200 µm before use. Thermal desorption was done by soil pyrolysis. Soil samples were taken in pre-weighed crucibles and were pyrolyzed at 500 °C in muffle furnace with 60 min residence time
