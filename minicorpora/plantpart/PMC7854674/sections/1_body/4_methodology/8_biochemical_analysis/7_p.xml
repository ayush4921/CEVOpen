 </sup>. The reaction mixture (3 mL) was composed of 13 mM methionine, 0.075 mM NBT, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.002 mM riboflavin, and 0.1 mL of enzyme extract in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.8). The mixture in the tube was placed under fluorescent light for 15 min thereafter the reaction was stopped by turning the lights off. A complete reaction mixture (non-irradiated) was used as a blank. The absorbance was read at 560 nm with a spectrophotometer. One unit of SOD activity was defined as the amount of enzyme, which reduced the absorbance reading by 50% as compared to the control (lacking enzyme).
