 </sup>. Leaf material (0.1 g) was homogenized with 4 mL sulfosalicylic acid (3.0%) with the help of pestle and mortar. This sample was previously kept overnight at 5 °C. The suspension was centrifuged at room temperature at 3000 rpm for 5 min; Supernatant was mixed with 4 mL acetic ninhydrin reagent and mechanically shaken and the contents in the tubes were heated for one hour at 100 °C. After cooling the content in the tubes and this solution was extracted with 4 mL of toluene with the help of a separating funnel. Then the toluene layer was separated and its absorbance was recorded with a spectrophotometer at 520 nm. The concentration of the proline of these unknown samples was calculated by using the standard curve of proline.
