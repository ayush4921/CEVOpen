 </sup>, using Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) as standard. Fresh leaves (0.1 g) were ground in 1 mL of sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) with the help of mortar and pestle and this mixture was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant (0.1 mL) was taken in the test tubes. Total volume was made 1 mL with the help of Distilled water. 1mLof reagent made by mixing 50 mL of solution A (2.0 g Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub>) 0.4 g NaOH (0.1 N) and 1 g Na–K tartrate was dissolved in 100 mL of distilled water) and 1 mL of solution B (CuSO
 <sub>4</sub>.5H
 <sub>2</sub>O (0.5 g) dissolved in 100 mL of distilled water) was added. After shaking for 10 min. 0.1 mL of Folin phenol reagent (diluted with distilled water in the ratio 1:1) was added. After 30 min absorbance of each sample was recorded at 650 nm after 30 min.
