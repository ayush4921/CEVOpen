 </sup>, the method was used for estimating the sugar content of leaves. Leaf material (0.5 g) was crushed with the help of a clean pestle and mortar, 10 mL of distilled water was added to this material. Then this homogenized material was filtered. 0.1 mL of the filtrate from each sample was taken in the separate test tube and 1 mL of (5% v/v), phenol was added and left at room temperature for one hour. After 1 h 5 mL of H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> was added to the test tubes. Then absorbance of each sample was noted at 420 nm by a spectrophotometer. The standard curve of glucose solution of known concentration was used to estimate the sugar content of the samples.
