0: Thermal desorption is a very effective technique for decontamination of oil-polluted soils but thermal treatments lead to changes in soil fertility and water levels which can limit its use for vegetation 4.
1: In contrast, biochar has less remediation potential but can change the soil physicochemical properties 13, improve the water holding capacities of the soil 14 eventually resulting in increased soil fertility 15; with potential beneficial effects on crop productivity, plant establishment, and growth 13.
2: Hence, the integration of thermal desorption with the biochar amendment can not only lead to enhanced remediation of crude oil but can also prove effective for better plant growth.
3: Currently, to the best of our knowledge, there is no published record on the comparison of pyrochar and thermal desorption, alone or in the combined application.
4: In this study, we have investigated the remediation of crude oil contaminated soil through pyrochar addition and thermal desorption of crude oil-contaminated soil.
5: Treated soils were used to study the germination of lettuce and its morphological, physiological, and biochemical responses were used as indicators for soil toxicity.
