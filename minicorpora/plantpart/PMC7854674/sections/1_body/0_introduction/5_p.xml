 </sup>. Hence, the integration of thermal desorption with the biochar amendment can not only lead to enhanced remediation of crude oil but can also prove effective for better plant growth. Currently, to the best of our knowledge, there is no published record on the comparison of pyrochar and thermal desorption, alone or in the combined application. In this study, we have investigated the remediation of crude oil contaminated soil through pyrochar addition and thermal desorption of crude oil-contaminated soil. Treated soils were used to study the germination of lettuce and its morphological, physiological, and biochemical responses were used as indicators for soil toxicity.
