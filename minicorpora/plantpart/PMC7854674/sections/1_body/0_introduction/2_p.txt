0: Crude oil affects the environment by changing the essential elements of habitat.
1: To overcome this problem, different soil remediation technologies have been developed such as soil washing with surfactants, biological treatment, thermal treatment, air stripping etc.
2: 3.
3: Thermal desorption treatment has been considered one of the very promising technique due to its possible applications to a wide range of organic contaminants and some heavy metals (Hg), converting them to volatile forms.
4: Nowadays, pyrolysis is being done during which the contaminated soil is heated between 350 and 500 C, which also reduces heat requirement from 40 to 60% as compared to other conventional heating methods 4.
5: According to Ren et al.
6: 5, 10 min of pyrolysis at 250 C of soil containing diesel reduced total petroleum hydrocarbons from 6272 to 359 mg/kg.
7: However, it affects soil porosity and properties, which are not easy to be recovered 6.
