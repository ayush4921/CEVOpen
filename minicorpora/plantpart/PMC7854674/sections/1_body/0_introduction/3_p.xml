<p id="Par4">Pyrolysis through the carbonization of biomass at processing temperatures of above 300 °C under oxygen-free conditions, produces pyrochar. Pyrochar is a new and effective soil amendment which can maintain soil nutrient and enhance carbon sequestration. Pyrochar also shows great potential for water conservation and water use efficiency improvement under greenhouse cultivation. Pyrochar has a high potential for carbon sequestration and acts as activated carbon and can be effectively used in soil bioremediation processes
