0: Pyrolysis through the carbonization of biomass at processing temperatures of above 300 C under oxygen-free conditions, produces pyrochar.
1: Pyrochar is a new and effective soil amendment which can maintain soil nutrient and enhance carbon sequestration.
2: Pyrochar also shows great potential for water conservation and water use efficiency improvement under greenhouse cultivation.
3: Pyrochar has a high potential for carbon sequestration and acts as activated carbon and can be effectively used in soil bioremediation processes 7.
4: Moreover, pyrochar has improved physical and chemical properties and has the potential for soil amendment, carbon sequestration, pollution remediation, and bioenergy production 8.
