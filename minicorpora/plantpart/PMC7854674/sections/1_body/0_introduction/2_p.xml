<p id="Par3">Crude oil affects the environment by changing the essential elements of habitat. To overcome this problem, different soil remediation technologies have been developed such as soil washing with surfactants, biological treatment, thermal treatment, air stripping etc.

 </sup>. Thermal desorption treatment has been considered one of the very promising technique due to its possible applications to a wide range of organic contaminants and some heavy metals (Hg), converting them to volatile forms. Nowadays, pyrolysis is being done during which the contaminated soil is heated between 350 and 500 °C, which also reduces heat requirement from 40 to 60% as compared to other conventional heating methods
