 </sup>. The present research was designed to observe the remediation potential of a novel combined application treatment (pyrochar and thermal desorption) technique, thermal desorption alone, and pyrochar alone in the oil-polluted soil. We found that these methods are not only beneficial to remediate the soil but also capable to overcome the toxic nature of crude oil.
