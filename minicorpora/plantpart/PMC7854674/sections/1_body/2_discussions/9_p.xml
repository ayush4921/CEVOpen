 <sub>2</sub> in all the subcellular compartments. Combined application treatment (pyrochar and thermal desorption) treatment significantly improved plant antioxidant systems and helped plants to prevent damage by reactive oxygen species. Pyrochar treatment showed a significant increase of 9% and 13% in treated plants at 10% and 20% crude oil contamination. The remediation processes may increase the antioxidants by stimulating the intake of nitrogen and phosphorus, which interact with carbohydrates as non-enzymatic antioxidants
