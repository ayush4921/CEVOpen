<p id="Par26">Treatment of soil with combined application treatment (pyrochar and thermal desorption) showed the most promising results in the degradation of crude oil. An inverse relationship exists between the rate of hydrocarbon degradation and the level of oil contamination as hydrocarbon degradation decreases with an increase in the oil contamination. This treatment degraded the crude oil contaminants in more members of low molecular weight compounds at both contamination levels (10% and 20%). In combined application treatment, both pyrochar and thermal desorption techniques acted synergistically and their combined application significantly improved the degradation potential. Thermal desorption accelerates the degradations whereas pyrochar has also shown the potential of oil degradation and promotes microbial degradation
