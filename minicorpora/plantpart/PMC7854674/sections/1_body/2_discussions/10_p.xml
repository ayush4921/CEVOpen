<p id="Par33">Correlation analysis showed that hydrocarbon degradation in contaminated soil is positively correlated with lettuce plant growth by regulating plant defense responses including antioxidant enzymes and osmolytes. This study establishes the relationship between the degradation potential of the new technique of combined application treatment (pyrochar and thermal desorption) with improved soil properties and ultimately in plant growth.</p>
