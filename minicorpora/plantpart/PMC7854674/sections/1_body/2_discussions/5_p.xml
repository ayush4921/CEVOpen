<p id="Par28">Overall, crude oil contamination showed adverse effects on the growth of lettuce plants by reducing plant vigor, biomass, yellowing, and wilting of leaves. However, all soil treatments showed a significant reduction in crude oil toxicity and ultimately improvement in the growth of lettuce plants. A higher level of contamination (20%) had more drastic reductions as compared to low (10%) crude oil contamination). Application of combined application treatment (pyrochar and thermal desorption) results in enhanced seed germination, plant establishment, and growth; ultimately increasing crop productivity

 </sup>. Pyrolysis of oil-contaminated soil results in higher exchange capacity, surface area, and direct nutrient additions and hence in better growth promotions

 </sup>. The thermal desorption technique is a very useful remediation technology because it is highly effective in decontaminating pollutants and organic chemicals. After thermal treatment, soil structure and properties were affected and the porosity of soil changes which is not easy to be recovered

 </sup>. No prior information is available about the response of plant germination to pyrochar application or its combined application with thermal desorption. However, our results are showing that this new technique of combined application treatment (pyrochar and thermal desorption) performed better than both pyrochar and thermal desorption techniques, alone, and thus its application can significantly improve plant growth and germination attributes.
