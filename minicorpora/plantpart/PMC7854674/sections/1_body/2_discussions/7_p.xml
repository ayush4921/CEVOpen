 <italic>,</italic> have been reported a similar decline in chlorophyll content of plants. Combined application treatment (pyrochar and thermal desorption) improved plant growth and chlorophyll content. Pyrochar and pyrolysis did improve plant pigments, but their effects were less pronounced. The increase in chlorophyll content might be due to an increase in nutrient uptake by the plant and a decrease in crude oil uptake
