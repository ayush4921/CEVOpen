 </sup> including organic carbons and binds hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs), such as PAHs, more strongly. The thermal desorption technique is a very useful remediation technology because it is highly effective in decontaminating pollutants and organic chemicals. After thermal treatment, soil structure and properties were affected and the porosity of soil changes which is not easy to be recovered
