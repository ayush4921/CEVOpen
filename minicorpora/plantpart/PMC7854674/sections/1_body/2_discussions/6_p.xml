 <italic>,</italic> where fresh weight and dry weight increased because of the pyrochar amendment in soil. Thereby, pyrochar may reduce the leaching losses of nutrients by adding nutrients to the soil. Pyrolysis of soil was effective in soil remediation and soil biomass increased when compared with stress-imposed plants

 </sup>. A combined application of both these treatments was most effective in the improvement of plant growth under crude oil contamination. This may be due to the reason that as itâ€™s a combined application technique, and combined effect of pyrochar and thermal desorption can complement each other and thus prove to be more effective.
