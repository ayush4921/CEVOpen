<p id="Par11">GC–MS analysis of soil samples for the identification of compounds being generated after the degradation of crude oil. The results suggested that crude oil was degraded in soil by different treatments after the 120 days’ trial. The mass spectrometer identified the hydrocarbon constituents using the NIST Library. We found a range of compounds (aliphatic and aromatic) with different molecular weights (173–422). The data generated the total ion chromatograms, which revealed that the transformations of parent compounds (crude oil) are associated with the production of metabolites. The metabolites generated during the degradation of a quaternary mixture of PAHs provided useful information about the biodegradation process. GC–MS analysis showed that high molecular weight compounds were degraded, and the peak area indicated the presence of hydrocarbons in soil (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). After 120 days’ trial, the products of soil treated with combined application treatment were Dodecane, Undecane 3,8 dimethyl, Dodecane 2,6,11, Trimethyl, 
 <italic>n</italic>-Hexadeconic acid, Hexadecane, and Flouranthene. These possibly originated from the synergistic effect of pyrochar and thermal desorption. Whereas, pyrochar and thermal desorption resulted in the production of a lesser number of compounds (9H-Flourine, 9-methylene, 2-Bromotetradecane, Hexdecane, Pyrene were produced by pyrochar whereas thermal desorption produced Heptadecane, Heptadecane 6,10 tetramethyl, 7,9 Di-tert-butyl-1-oxaspiro (4,5), Phthalic acid bis (7-methyl octyl) ester). Overall, the GC–MS analysis showed that combined application treatment degraded PAH into more number of lesser molecular weight compounds and thus more effective in decontamination.
