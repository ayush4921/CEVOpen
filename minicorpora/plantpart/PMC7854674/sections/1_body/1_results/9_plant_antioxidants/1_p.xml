<p id="Par22">A notable rise in antioxidants was recorded in crude oil contaminated conditions (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Combined application treatment (Pyrochar and thermal desorption) increased superoxide dismutase activity by 140% and 100% in lettuce plants grown under 10% and 20% contamination, respectively. Pyrochar increased SOD by 55% and 34%, thermal desorption by 82% and 68% at 10% and 20% contamination, respectively. Combined application treatment (Pyrochar and thermal desorption) treatment significantly reduces the adverse effects of crude oil contamination by increasing catalase activity by 53% and 27% in plants grown under 10% and 20% contamination, respectively. The increase in catalase by pyrochar was 28% and 13% and thermal desorption by 185% and 10% at 10% and 20% crude oil contamination, respectively. Similarly, lettuce plants when treated with combined application treatment (Pyrochar and thermal desorption) showed pronounced peroxidase activity by 49% and 46% at 10% and 20% contamination, respectively. Pyrochar treatment showed a significant increase of 9% and 13% in treated plants at 10% and 20% crude oil contamination. Whereas, thermal desorption increased peroxidase activity by 25% and 20% at 10% and 20% crude oil contamination, respectively. Both varieties of lettuce responded to bioremediation.
