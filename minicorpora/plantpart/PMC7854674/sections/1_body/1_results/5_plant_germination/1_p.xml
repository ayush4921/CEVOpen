<p id="Par12">The effect of soil remediation through pyrochar, thermal desorption, and their combined application had shown a significant effect (p â‰¤ 0.05) on the germination of two lettuce varieties. Crude oil stress decreased the germination percentage up to 29.7% and 39% in 10% and 20% contaminated soil as compared to the control. Application of combined application (pyrochar and thermal desorption) resulted in 28.5% and 21.8% increase in germination percentage of both lettuce varieties as compared with respective control stress of 10% and 20% contaminated soil. There was a 24% and 17.5% increase in germination percentage by pyrochar and 19% and 12.3% by thermal desorption 10% and 20% contaminated soil. The seedling vigor index also increased by 35.5% and 28.7% by pyrochar and thermal desorption remediation in 20% contaminated soil. Similar trends were observed in the promptness index (Supplementary Fig.
