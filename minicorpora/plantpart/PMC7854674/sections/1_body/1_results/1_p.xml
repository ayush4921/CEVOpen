<p id="Par7">The present research was designed to observe the remediation potential of a new combined application technique i.e. pyrochar (slow pyrolysis biochar); thermal desorption alone and their combined application in the crude oil-polluted soil. We found that this new combined application was effective not only in remediating the soil but also neutralized the toxic nature of crude oil.</p>
