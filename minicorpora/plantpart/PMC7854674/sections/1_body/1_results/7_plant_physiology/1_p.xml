<p id="Par14">There was a decrease in Chlorophyll a (40% and 45% decrease at 10–20% contamination, respectively), Chlorophyll b (26% and 30% decrease at 10–20% contamination, respectively), and total chlorophyll (20% and 25% decrease at 10–20% contamination, respectively) contents (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), with an increase in the concentration of crude oil compared to non-polluted soils condition. Combined application treatment (Pyrochar and thermal desorption) improved the plant growth and total chlorophyll contents by 21 and 17% at 10–20% contamination respectively, as compared to the stressed plants.
