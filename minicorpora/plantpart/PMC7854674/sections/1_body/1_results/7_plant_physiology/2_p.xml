<p id="Par15">Similarly, it was observed that the presence of 10% and 20% crude oil contamination decreased water potential by one and one and a half fold whereas combined application treatment improved water potential by 33.6% and 26.9% at respective low (10%) and high (20%) crude oil concentration (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). In our observations, pyrochar increased the water potential of the leaf by 10% and 21% at 10–20% contamination, respectively. Whereas thermal desorption improved water potential by at 24% and 20% at 10–20% contamination, respectively Pyrolysis treatment remediated the soil and improved plant parameters.
