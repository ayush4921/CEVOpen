<p id="Par16">Under 10% and 20% contamination crude oil contamination, the membrane stability index (MSI) decreased to 38.4% and 40.5% as compared to the control. Pyrochar addition resulted in a 32% and 21.6% increase in MSI in plants under both levels of crude oil. Thermal desorption showed an increase of 13% and 9.5% as compared to the stressed plants, whereas pyrochar showed a respective increase of 18% and 11%, as compared to respective control. A similar response was shown by both varieties.</p>
