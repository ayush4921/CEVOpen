<p id="Par8">Crude oil contamination negatively affected soil properties by causing a decrease in soil pH (3% and 7% at 10% and 20% contamination), EC (10% and 28% at 10% and 20% contamination), and soil moisture content (27.6% and 41.5% at 10% and 20% contamination). Results showed a significant reduction in available nutrients. The nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium showed a maximum reduction by 29 and 40%, 7%, and 15%, and to trace quantities at 10% and 20% contamination, respectively as compared to the non-contaminated soil. However, organic carbon improved significantly by two and three times, at 10% and 20% contamination. Pyrochar improved soil characteristics not only under control conditions but also under oil contamination. Thermal desorption had little effect on soil properties. Soil amendments with pyrochar and thermal desorption improved the properties of soil.</p>
