<p id="Par23">For heat map analysis the data of both lettuce seedlings under crude oil contamination stress were classified as hydrocarbon degradation, antioxidant enzymes, chlorophyll contents, osmolyte production, and each group showed positive correlations (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). A comparative analysis of the factors related to hydrocarbon degradation (presented by green boxes) suggested that hydrocarbon degradation in contaminated soil had a positive correlation with amino acid, osmotic potential, soluble sugars, proline, MDA, SOD, POD, and CAT activities. While a negative correlation between total chlorophyll and MSI was observed. These results indicate that the degradation efficiency of combined application treatment (pyrochar and thermal desorption) for crude oil contamination resulted in better growth of lettuce plants.
