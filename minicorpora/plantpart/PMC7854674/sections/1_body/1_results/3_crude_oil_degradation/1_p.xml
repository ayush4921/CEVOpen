<p id="Par10">The effect of pyrochar and thermal desorption on the degradation of hydrocarbons was significant (p ≤ 0.5). An inverse relationship exists between the rate of hydrocarbon degradation and the level of oil contamination as hydrocarbon degradation decreased with an increase in the oil contamination. Treatment of soil with a combined application of pyrochar and thermal desorption showed more promising results of 40.1% degradation of hydrocarbons which is 30 folds greater as compared to control one at 20% level of crude oil. The addition of pyrochar showed 25% hydrocarbon degradation which is 13.8 times more compared to the control one. While 19.7% of degradation of hydrocarbons was recorded with thermal desorption as compared to control one. The degradation order of effectiveness is combined application treatment &gt; pyrochar &gt; thermal desorption &gt; control (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). So, a combined application of pyrochar and thermal desorption is more effective and is suggested as possible remediation of hydrocarbon contamination. An inverse relationship exists between the rate of hydrocarbon degradation and the level of oil contamination as hydrocarbon degradation decreased with an increase in the oil contamination. (Table
