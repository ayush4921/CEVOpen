<p id="Par13">Plant fresh and dry biomass (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) showed a considerable decrease (30% and 40% in 10% and 20% contaminated soil) and leaf area (25% and 30% in 10% and 20% contaminated soil). We found that combined application treatment had the most pronounced results by showing a maximum increase of plant biomass up to 40% (10% contamination) and 22% (20% contamination), respectively. Soil amendment with pyrochar helped to mitigate the effect of crude oil and increased by 30% and 38% biomass at 10% and 20% contaminated soil. Whereas, thermal desorption improved growth by 12% (10% contamination) and 10% (20% contamination). Both varieties performed well in response to the degradation potential of pyrochar, thermal desorption, and their combined application (Fig.
