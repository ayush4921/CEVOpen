  <p>Fresh and dry biomass and leaf area of two lettuce varieties growing in crude oil contaminated, pyrochar, thermal desorption, and their combined application remediated soil. Detail of treatments: Where, T0 = control soil, T1 = 10% crude oil contaminated soil, T2 = 20% crude oil contaminated soil, T3 = Pyrochar treated control soil, T4 = Pyrochar + 10% crude oil contaminated soil, T5 = Pyrochar + 20% crude oil contaminated soil, T6 = Thermal desorption control soil, T7 = Thermal desorption + 10% crude oil contaminated soil, T8 = Thermal desorption + 20% crude oil contaminated soil, T9 = Pyrochar + Thermal desorption control soil, T10 = Pyrochar + Thermal desorption + 10% crude oil contaminated soil, T11 = Pyrochar + Thermal desorption + 20% crude oil contaminated. soil V1 = Iceberg, V2 = Boston. This data displays the means and standard deviation (n = 3). Different letters show significant differences (p &lt; 0.05).</p>
