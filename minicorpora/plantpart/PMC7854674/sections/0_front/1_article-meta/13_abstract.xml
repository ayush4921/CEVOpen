 <p id="Par1">Crude oil contamination is a serious environmental threat for soil and plants growing in it. This study provides the first experimental evidence for comparison of the efficacy of pyrochar (slow pyrolysis biochar), thermal desorption and their combined application for degradation of crude oil contaminated soil (0%, 10%, and 20%), and growth of lettuce under glasshouse conditions. Pyrochar was produced by pyrolysis of sawdust at 350 °C, whereas thermal desorption was done by soil pyrolysis at 500 °C. Soil incubations were done for 120 days. The results of soil analysis showed that the crude oil degradation efficiency for the combined application was highest (40%), whereas pyrochar and thermal desorption was 25% and 19.6%, respectively. The maximum degradation products of crude oil were manifested by the detection of low molecular weight hydrocarbons (ranged between 173 and 422) in the soil with combined application treatment using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC–MS) analysis. Crude oil contamination significantly reduced the germination and growth of the lettuce plants. Similarly, the combined application also improved plant growth by an increase of 24% in germination percentage, 35.5% in seedling vigor index, and 27% in promptness index under 20% crude oil contamination. Remediation caused a significant increase in fresh and dry biomass (40%), leaf area (30%), total chlorophyll (21%), water potential (23.6%), osmotic potential (27%), and membrane stability index (40%). Moreover, there was an increase in the contents of proline (32%), total amino acids (29%), soluble sugars (37%), proteins (27%), and antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (19%), catalase (33%) and peroxidase (38%). This study confirmed the efficacy of pyrochar (slow pyrolysis biochar), thermal desorption, and their combined application for crude oil decontamination of soil at laboratory scale and also in improving soil usability by improved germination and growth of lettuce.</p>
