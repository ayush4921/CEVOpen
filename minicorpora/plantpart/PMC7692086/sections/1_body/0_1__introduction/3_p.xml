<p>The biodegradability of plastic materials is defined as their ability to decompose through the enzymatic action of microorganisms [
 <xref rid="B5-polymers-12-02518" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The polymer degradation in a bioactive environment occurs by material fragmentation and subsequent mineralization. The action of heat and moisture as well as enzymatic activity of microorganisms abbreviate and fade the polymer chains, resulting in fragmentized residues of the polymer. These polymer fragments can only be considered biodegradable if they are consumed by microorganisms as food and energy source converted at the end of the degradation process into carbon dioxide (CO
 <sub>2</sub>), water (H
 <sub>2</sub>O) and biomass under aerobic conditions and hydrocarbons, methane and biomass under anaerobic conditions [
