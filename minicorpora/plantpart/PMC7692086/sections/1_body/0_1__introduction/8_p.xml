 <xref rid="B37-polymers-12-02518" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="B38-polymers-12-02518" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In the food industry, microbial deterioration and lipid oxidation are major problems to be overcome in order to increase the shelf life of food products [
 <xref rid="B25-polymers-12-02518" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The release of bioactive compounds from films into foods prevents the oxidation of lipid compounds present in their composition [

 <xref rid="B38-polymers-12-02518" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], improving their shelf life. Thus, the use of natural bioactive compounds in biodegradable films has proved to be a potential alternative for solving this problem in the food industry and for replacing traditional packaging [
 <xref rid="B25-polymers-12-02518" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Previous review papers have summarized the most recent trends on the strategies used for stabilizing bioactive compounds for inclusion in packaging materials [
 <xref rid="B39-polymers-12-02518" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and for release control of active compounds from food active packaging systems [
 <xref rid="B40-polymers-12-02518" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Given the relevance and scope of the topic and the large amount of scientific research addressing the incorporation of bioactive compounds in films, more review articles are still needed. According to all the facts, this article provides an overview of the types of agro-based polymers from renewable sources and plant-derived bioactive compounds used, as well as the latest trends on methods used for their inclusion in biodegradable films. In addition, an in-depth description of each method of producing bioactive films and their functional properties is presented.
