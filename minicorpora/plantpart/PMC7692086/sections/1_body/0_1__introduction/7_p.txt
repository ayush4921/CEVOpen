0: The incorporation of bioactive compounds into biodegradable films has been extensively studied [ 3, 9, 28, 29, 31, 32].
1: The use of inherently bioactive biopolymer-based materials [ 33, 34, 35] as well as the incorporation, direct or by sprinkling, of free or encapsulated bioactive compounds into the film-forming solutions [ 26, 29] are some of the techniques employed for their production.
