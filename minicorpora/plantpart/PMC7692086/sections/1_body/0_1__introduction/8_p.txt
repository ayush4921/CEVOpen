0: The application of bioactive films in packaging as a strategy for extending the shelf life, stability and safety of food products has shown great potential [ 36, 37, 38].
1: In the food industry, microbial deterioration and lipid oxidation are major problems to be overcome in order to increase the shelf life of food products [ 25].
2: The release of bioactive compounds from films into foods prevents the oxidation of lipid compounds present in their composition [ 37], as well as the growth of microorganisms [ 38], improving their shelf life.
3: Thus, the use of natural bioactive compounds in biodegradable films has proved to be a potential alternative for solving this problem in the food industry and for replacing traditional packaging [ 25].
4: Previous review papers have summarized the most recent trends on the strategies used for stabilizing bioactive compounds for inclusion in packaging materials [ 39] and for release control of active compounds from food active packaging systems [ 40].
5: Given the relevance and scope of the topic and the large amount of scientific research addressing the incorporation of bioactive compounds in films, more review articles are still needed.
6: According to all the facts, this article provides an overview of the types of agro-based polymers from renewable sources and plant-derived bioactive compounds used, as well as the latest trends on methods used for their inclusion in biodegradable films.
7: In addition, an in-depth description of each method of producing bioactive films and their functional properties is presented.
