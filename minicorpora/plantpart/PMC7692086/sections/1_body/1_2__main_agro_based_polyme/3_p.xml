<p>Starch, a polysaccharide composed of two macromolecules, amylose and amylopectin, is used in its native and modified form. In addition, due to different proportions of amylose and amylopectin present in different starch sources, unconventional starch sources have been increasingly used in the production of edible films, such as arrowroot starch [

 <xref rid="B45-polymers-12-02518" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The two components can be separated, allowing new blends with other proportions and, thus, increasing their use [
