<p>Instead of using inherently bioactive products, bioactive films can also be developed by incorporating natural raw materials that are sources of bioactive compounds or isolated bioactive compounds into the biopolymer film-forming solution during preparation. Some studies incorporate the bioactive compounds into the biopolymer during solubilization [

 <xref rid="B32-polymers-12-02518" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], while others previously solubilize the biopolymer and then incorporate the bioactive compounds to produce the film-forming solution [

The different stages of the incorporation of bioactive compounds into film-forming solutions result from their solubilization characteristics, the amount of material to be added, their water content and instability in production conditions (pH, temperature, among others). This is the most common type of incorporation of bioactive compounds in films. This technique allows a homogeneous distribution of the active compound in the polymeric matrix and a slow release to the surrounding environment [
