<p>Brito et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-polymers-12-02518" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] produced yellow, malleable, homogeneous and water-soluble films with fruit and vegetable residual flour (including peels, pits, seeds and stalks) with different granulometries and pectin levels. The residual flour with lower granulometry (&lt;150 μm) had higher protein content. This flour, when enriched with pectin (0.25%) significantly reduced the hygroscopicity of the film, in addition to producing better mechanical properties. In contrast, the flour with higher granulometry (425–500 μm) was rich in dietary fibers, showing potential for application as a reinforcement material (micro/nanometric fibers) for biodegradable films. For the authors, flours produced with residues and with different granulometries can have different applications, depending on the size of the particles and composition.
