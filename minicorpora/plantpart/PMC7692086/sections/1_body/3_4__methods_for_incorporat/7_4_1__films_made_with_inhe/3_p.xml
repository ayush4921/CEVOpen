<p>Maniglia et al. [
 <xref rid="B35-polymers-12-02518" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] used babassu mesocarp, a byproduct of the babassu oil extraction industry, to produce bioactive films. These authors developed films with babassu mesocarp, or with starch isolated from babassu mesocarp, by steeping in water, alkaline or acid medium. Both materials used in the production of the films and the films obtained from them showed phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity. The different methods used for obtaining starch also influenced the different levels of amylose, lipids, fibers and total phenolic compounds, which reflected in the mechanical and functional properties of the films obtained by these methods.
