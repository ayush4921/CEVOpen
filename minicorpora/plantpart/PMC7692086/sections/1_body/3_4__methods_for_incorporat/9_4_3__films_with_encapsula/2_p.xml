<p>The encapsulation of bioactive compounds is one of the ways to stabilize and maintain their viability and extend their shelf life. Encapsulation refers to the process of trapping the bioactive compound into microsystems (microparticles) or nano-systems (nanoparticles) of structural engineering in order to develop a thermodynamic and physical barrier that protects against adverse conditions (heat, humidity, oxidation, chemical reactions or other extreme conditions), releasing it when necessary [
