<p>Becerril et al. [
 <xref rid="B39-polymers-12-02518" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] described in detail in their review emulsion techniques, core-shell nanofibers, cyclodextrins and liposomes, among others, as the most recent strategies used for encapsulating antimicrobial agents for their stable inclusion in packaging materials. The size and shape of the micro or nanoparticles produced were quite variable due to the encapsulating material and the microencapsulation method used for their preparations. The choice for the microencapsulation method is guided by cost, properties of the wall material and material to be encapsulated, the application and the desired application mechanisms.
