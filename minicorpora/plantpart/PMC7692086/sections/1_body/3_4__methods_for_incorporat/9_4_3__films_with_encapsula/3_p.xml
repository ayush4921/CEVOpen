<p>The strategy of incorporating encapsulated bioactive compounds into the film has been used for: (i) maintaining the stability and viability of active compounds when exposed to unfavorable conditions; (ii) improving compatibility between packaging polymer and bioactive compound (increased miscibility of lipophilic compounds with hydrophilic biopolymeric materials); (iii) increasing the availability of the bioactive compound; (iv) controlling the release of these compounds by specific stimuli [
