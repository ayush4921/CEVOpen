<p>With the exception of starch, raw materials of agricultural origin, such as cellulose, alginate sodium, pectin, chitosan, gums and proteins, such as whey, soy, gluten and gelatin, among others, the isolation process of these polymers can require high energy consumption and expensive chemicals, which affect the economic and environmental values of the films produced with them. The great variability regarding the physicalâ€“chemical composition of the origin of both the agricultural polymers and the plant-derived bioactive compounds also hinder the standardization of the bioactive functional properties, water vapor permeability, tensile strength, elongation at break, as well as of the physical properties of films produced with them. The current laboratory-scale production of agro-based films incorporated with plant-derived bioactive compounds has problems such as the inability to make continuous films, long drying times and imprecise thickness control. Thus, to overcome these issues, better and cheaper production methods are needed along with investments in scaling machines so that the films produced can compete with the current ones, not only in terms of efficiency, but also in terms of price [
