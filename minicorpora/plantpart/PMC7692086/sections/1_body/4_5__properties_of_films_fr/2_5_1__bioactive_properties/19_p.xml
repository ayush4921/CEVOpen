<p>The more homogeneous the distribution of the bioactive compound in the film, the more efficient it will act on the food surface. For example, films containing allyl isocyanate (AIT) microemulsions showed stronger antimicrobial activity and were more homogeneous than those containing conventional emulsions. According to Guo [
 <xref rid="B104-polymers-12-02518" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>], the fact that the particles are smaller allowed for a more homogeneous distribution of allyl isocyanate (AIT) encapsulated in microemulsions and micro-particles, and the presence of micro-pores with sizes ranging from 100 to 300 nm and micro-channels in the film matrix allowed the migration of the antimicrobial from the center to the film surface and its release into the liquid medium or food. This allowed the films to have a continuous antimicrobial effect on food during prolonged exposure.
