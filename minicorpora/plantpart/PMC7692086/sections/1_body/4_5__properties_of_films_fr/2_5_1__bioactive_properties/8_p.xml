<p>Thus, in order for the packaging system to achieve its intended purpose, knowledge of the controlled transfer mechanism of bioactive compounds to food is required, as well as of the microbial growth kinetics or lipid oxidation. When the rate of migration of an antimicrobial or antioxidant agent is faster than the growth rate of target microorganisms or lipid oxidation, the bioactive agent will be depleted before the expected storage period. As a result, the packaging system will lose its activity and this will cause the growth of microorganisms or lipid oxidation. On the other hand, when the release rate is very slow, microorganisms can grow before the antimicrobial agent is released, in the same way as lipid oxidation. Thus, the release rate of bioactive compounds from the film into the food must be specifically controlled to be similar to the growth rate of the target microorganisms and the oxidation rate of the target lipid compounds [
