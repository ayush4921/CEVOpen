The authors attributed this behavior to the fact that blackberry microparticles remained on the film surface, which may have facilitated the extraction of bioactive compounds due to the direct contact between the blackberry and the extraction solvents. As for the direct incorporation, the blackberry was integrated into the polymeric matrix. This probably hindered the extraction of bioactive compounds by the extraction solvents, since arrowroot starch may have functioned as a protective barrier [
