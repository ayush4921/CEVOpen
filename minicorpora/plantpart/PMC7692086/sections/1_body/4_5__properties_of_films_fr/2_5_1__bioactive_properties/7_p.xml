<p>Active packaging, in addition to protecting food, as conventional packaging does, has acquired new functions, such as the release of antimicrobial and antioxidant agents onto food surfaces, bringing extra benefits to the packaged food product [
 <xref rid="B138-polymers-12-02518" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>]. When bioactive films are applied in foods, their intentional interaction with the food (direct contact) and/or medium, empty packaging space (indirect contact) in which it is inserted leads to the release of bioactive compounds with different properties (antioxidant and or antimicrobial, among others) onto the food surface, where it will act to inhibit the growth of microorganisms and prevent oxidation of lipids, fats and other compounds [

 <xref rid="B138-polymers-12-02518" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>], as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="polymers-12-02518-f004">Figure 4</xref>. For this to happen, biopolymeric films must keep bioactive compounds (anthocyanins, flavonoids, vitamins, among others) bioavailable and in the best conditions until they are released into the food system. In addition, the release of bioactive compounds must be sufficiently abundant to guarantee their intended action, such as, for example, antioxidant or antimicrobial.
