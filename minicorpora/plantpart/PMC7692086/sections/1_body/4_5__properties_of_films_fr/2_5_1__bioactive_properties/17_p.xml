<p>The production of multilayer films has also been used as a strategy to modify the location of bioactive compounds in the polymer matrix and to improve the control of the release of bioactive compounds from the film to foods or food simulants. Layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition is one of the methods used in this production. The layers are formed one by one, being physically or chemically bonded together to form the final multilayer film [

Basically, the multilayer bioactive films produced are composed of three layers: a layer with high barrier properties used to prevent the loss of the bioactive compound to the environment; the matrix layer containing the bioactive compound, which has high diffusion; and a control layer that is in contact with the food and has less swelling capacity than the matrix layer, which allows the control of the release of the bioactive compound to the food surface [

 <xref rid="B141-polymers-12-02518" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>] prepared edible multilayer films using zein and gelatin (outer layer of zein, intermediate layer of zein / gelatin and inner layer of gelatin) containing tea polyphenols in the middle and inner layer. Multilayer films exhibited a longer and slower release form compared to mono or bilayer films [
