<p>The use of plant-derived bioactive compounds with antioxidant and antimicrobial properties in biodegradable films as a sustainable strategy for maintaining and/or extending the shelf life of food products has been promising [
 <xref rid="B28-polymers-12-02518" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], since microbial growth and oxidation are largely responsible for the degradation of food products, which limit their conservation. One of the clear advantages of that use is to protect the packaged food without the addition of edible preservatives directly in its composition. This is because the incorporation of edible preservatives directly into the food has proved to have limited action due to the rapid diffusion of the bioactive substance from the surface to the mass of the product, leading to the concomitant loss of the effectiveness of its action [
