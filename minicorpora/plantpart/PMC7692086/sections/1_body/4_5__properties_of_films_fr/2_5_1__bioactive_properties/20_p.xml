<p>Despite the promising results, more studies should be carried out to evaluate the relationship between the location and the distribution of bioactive compounds in the film with their release rate in food. The vast majority of works perform release tests using food simulants to understand the migration of bioactive compounds from films to different types of food. Migration is measured using chemical tests that are specific to quantify the bioactive compounds or group of bioactive compounds in question. This is because it is extremely difficult to measure the direct migration of bioactive compounds from a film to a food due to complex compositions (water, carbohydrates, fats, lipids, proteins, vitamins, fibers and minerals) found in most foods [

Nevertheless, the release characteristics of bioactive compounds using food simulants may not be totally faithful to those found when using real foods, due not only to the different compositions, but also to the variety of other intrinsic characteristics, such as density, viscosity, water content, pH, food temperature, among others.
