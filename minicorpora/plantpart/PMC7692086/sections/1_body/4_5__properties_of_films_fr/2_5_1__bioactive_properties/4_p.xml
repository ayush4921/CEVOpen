<p>In another study, films incorporated with essential oils from medicinal plants showed the ability to kill and inhibit the growth of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, with varying activity regarding the inhibition zone (from 18.50 to 38.83 mm) for each bacterium [

The bioactive compounds present in essential oils are capable of destroying bacterial cell integrity, making it permeable, in addition to inhibiting respiratory processes and ion transport, which may result in its death. In addition to presenting an antimicrobial effect, these films simultaneously presented antioxidant capacity [
