<p>Wang et al. [
 <xref rid="B37-polymers-12-02518" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] reported that the addition of chitosan hydrochloride and chitosan carboxymethyl nanocomplexes containing anthocyanins, into gelatin films improved their mechanical properties, thermal stability and antioxidant capacity. The improvements in both the tensile strength and elongation at break of films were attributed to the homogeneous dispersion of nanocomplexes into the gelatin network and the interactions between the hydroxyl groups and the polar groups of gelatin. Chitosan films incorporated with a β-cyclodextrin inclusion complex of 2-phenyl ethanol were homogeneous, transparent and colorless, and showed high mechanical resistance [

The tensile strength increased from 34.5 to 48.8 MPa for chitosan films with the inclusion complex; Young’s modulus values also increased. The interactions between chitosan and the inclusion complex allowed the formation of a compact network, increasing film strength and stiffness [
