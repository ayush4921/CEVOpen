<p>In general, bioactive compounds with hydrophilic characteristics tend to increase the water vapor permeability of the film, since the water vapor transfer is generally caused by the hydrophilic composition of the film and depends on the composition of hydrophilic to hydrophobic compounds in the film [

Furthermore, the increase in water solubility, water vapor permeability and elongation at break observed in films with fruit pulp and plant extracts may be consequences of the presence of structural defects in the polymer matrix, as well as on the surface of films, which make them less resistant to the passage of water molecules. For cassava starch films, the incorporation of polyphenols-rich rosemary extracts inhibited the bond between the molecules of glycerol and starch and led to the formation of cracks in these materials. As a result, the water vapor permeability and the mechanical properties of the active films were affected [
