<p>As for films made with fruit pulps, the discontinuity of the polymeric matrix may be due, not only to the incorporation of bioactive compounds, but also to other structures present in their composition, such as proteins, lipids, fibers, vitamins, minerals and sugars that fit the biopolymer matrix through different types of intermolecular interactions [
