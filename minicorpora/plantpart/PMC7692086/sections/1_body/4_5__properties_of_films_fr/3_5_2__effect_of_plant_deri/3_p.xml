<p>The increasing incorporation from 0 to 40% (mass/mass of biopolymer) of blackberry pulp into the arrowroot starch film-forming solution, apart from generating color with tones ranging from violet to magenta, typical of blackberry pulp, also promoted an increase in thickness (from 0.065 to 0.133 mm), elongation (from 3.18% to 13.59%), water vapor permeability (from 3.62 to 4.60 g.mm/m
 <sup>2</sup>·day·kPa), water solubility (from 14.18 to 25.46%), and reduced tensile strength (from 22.71 to 3.97 MPa) [

The increase in thickness, of films produced by the casting method, is generally related to the increase in solid content due to the addition of fruit pulp, extracts or plant-derived bioactive compounds in the same volume or mass of solution deposited on the support plate, as well as to the protuberances found on the film surface [
