<p>The location of the particles of bioactive compounds in the films, within the polymeric matrix or on its surface, also influence the properties presented by them. Films incorporated directly into encapsulated blackberry pulp were less soluble in water than films incorporated with blackberry powder by spraying and the location of these film particles influenced this behavior. The fact that blackberry dust particles remained on the film surface when incorporated by spraying allowed its direct contact with water leading to solubilization, given its porous and hydrophilic characteristic, which consequently generated holes on the film; as a result, the water molecules entered the starch matrix and led to its solubilization. Water vapor permeability was also affected. The increase in blackberry particles in the film led to their aggregation. The aggregation of particles reduces the interaction between the active surface area and the polymeric matrix, decreasing its cohesiveness and consequently increasing water vapor permeability [
