<p>The knowledge on the functional properties of films is of fundamental importance and scientific and technological interest due to the requirements that the different films must present to be used as food packaging, since many industrial applications depend on these properties. Among the main functions of films from agro-based polymers that will be used as food packaging are the mass transfer control (to avoid gain or loss of solutes and volatiles), mechanical protection (protecting the integrity of food and packaging), protection barrier (controlling the migration of water vapor and gases between the product and the environment), low water solubility (protecting from solubilization in water). The incorporation of plant-derived bioactive compounds in the film-forming solution, besides modifying the bioactive properties of resulting films, can concomitantly modify their structure and, as a result, modify their functionality, such as their ability to serve as a water vapor barrier; water vapor permeability; tensile strength; elongation at break; and their physical properties such as opacity, color and thickness [
