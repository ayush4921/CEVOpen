<p>The final functionality of films is related to their bioactive properties (such as antioxidant, antimicrobial and antibrowning activities), their ability to serve as barrier to water vapor, oxygen, carbon dioxide and ultraviolet (UVâ€“vis) light, water vapor permeability; mechanical properties (tensile stress, elongation at break) and other physical properties (such as opacity and color) [
