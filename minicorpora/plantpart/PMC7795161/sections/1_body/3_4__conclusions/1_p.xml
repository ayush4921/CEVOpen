<p>The composition and antibacterial effects of 
 <italic>Lippia multiflora</italic> Moldenke from two regions of Angola were assessed. Samples were collected during, before and after flowering. The highest yield of essential oils among the 11 samples was obtained from flowers (5.2%) and leaves (3.8%, 1.7% and 1.3%). They were harvested in the municipality of Tombocco, province of Zaire. During this study, we observed that the composition of EOs also changes depending on the part of the plant. The main components identified were monoterpene hydrocarbons which reached proportions ranging from 19.60% to 93.82% of all compounds identified by GC-MS. The highest accumulation was Limonene (from 25.95% to 40.70%) in 
 <italic>Lippia</italic> samples collected before flowering. Piperitenone, Trans-tagetone, Neral, Citral, Elemol, p-cymene, Myrcene, Carvacrol, and Ipsenone were also identified, and their proportion varied between-sample. Two new compounds, including Verbenone and Artemisia ketone, were detected for the first time in the essential oil of 
 <italic>Lippia multiflora</italic> Moldenke from Angola. The analysis of 
 <italic>Lippia</italic>’s EOs by principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), followed by the highlighting of the heat map of the volatile compounds’ abundance allowed us to identify a variability between the populations from the two provinces, but also intraspecific variability between sub-groups within a population. Due to this great chemical variability, the antibacterial activity is also well-diversified. Thanks to HCA and PCA, we were able to discern the similarities between subgroup of chemotypes and differentiate their respective antibacterial activity. According to MIC and MBC values, 
 <italic>Lippia</italic> essential oils showed remarkable activity against the three bacteria 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. These results suggest that Angolan 
 <italic>Lippia multiflora</italic> Moldenke can be used as a safe alternative source in the pharmaceutical, cosmetic and food industries.
