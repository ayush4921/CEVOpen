<p>The evaluation of the antimicrobial activity was conducted by the method of agar solid diffusion by perforation of the cylindrical cavities [
 <xref rid="B54-molecules-26-00155" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Briefly, the organisms were further cultivated on nutrient broth at 37 °C for 24 h. The technique was conducted using a suspension with a standard McFarland turbidity of 0.5. L1–L9 essential oils were prepared in a suitable solvent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO 5%) and sterilised by a 0.22 μm syringe filter. Wells, 4mm high and 5 mm in diameter, were dug into the MH2 plates (55 mm). They were filled with 70 µL of the raw sample, 1:2 and 1:10 dilution of essential oil. Negative control (DMSO 5%), and two positive controls Penicillin (0.05 mg/mL), Gentamicin A (10 mg/mL) were also tested. The Petri dishes were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The antimicrobial effect was done in triplicate and determined in terms of IZD in mm.
