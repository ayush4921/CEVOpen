<p>The GC/MS analyses were performed with Agilent technology 7890A apparatus equipped with column J&amp;W DB5-ms (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d, film thickness 0.25 m) associated with an MS A 5975C inert XLMSD mass spectrometer. Transfer-line temperature 250 °C, ionization voltage 70 eV. The oven temperature was programmed isothermal at 60 °C for 5 min, then gradually increased to 250 °C at 10 °C/min, held isothermal at 250 °C for 15 min and finally raised to 280 °C at 10 °C/min, injector temperature 250 °C, source temperature 230° C, interface temperature 280 °C, quadrupole temperature 180 °C, carrier gas He (1.0 mL/min), automatic injection volume 1 μL, diluted samples (in dichloromethane) spitless injector. The identification of the compounds was based on a comparison of their retention indexes determined relative to the retention time of aliphatic hydrocarbons (C9–C28) and the mass spectra with those of authentic compounds using NIST databases and Wiley spectral libraries [
