<p>To determine the MIC and MBC, the macro dilution technique in MHB broth (Muller-Hinton Broth, Ref 724245-Oxoid Ltd, Basingstoke, UK) supplemented with 5% DMSO was used. In one tube, 0.5 mL of inoculum (5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> CFU/mL) prepared in MHB broth (+5% DMSO) and 0.4 mL of MHB broth (+5% DMSO) were placed. Sequential dilutions of EOs were prepared 1:2, 1:4, 1:8, 1:16, 1:32 and 1:64 respectively in DMSO. Two bactericidal antibiotics were used as positive controls, Penicillin G and Gentamicin A at concentrations of 0.05 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL respectively. DMSO was used as a negative control. After 18 h of incubation at 37 °C, 1 mL of resazurin was added. After 30 min, the tubes were visually examined. The change in the colour corresponding to the transformation of resazurin to resofurin reflects bacterial growth.
