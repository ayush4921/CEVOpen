<p>It is worthy to note from the results of the study that 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is the most resistant to the action of EOs. This bacterium is an opportunistic human pathogen responsible for several different nosocomial infections [
 <xref rid="B89-molecules-26-00155" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Through the presence of intrinsic resistance mechanisms and the development of irreversible mutations and adaptations, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> can survive and multiply in several environments and over a wide range of temperatures [
 <xref rid="B90-molecules-26-00155" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. It is resistant to all types of conventional antibiotics, as it has an exceptional capacity to develop biofilms that are difficult to control [
 <xref rid="B91-molecules-26-00155" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. The indiscriminate misuse of antimicrobial drugs would lead to an increase in bacterial resistance in chronic disease [
 <xref rid="B92-molecules-26-00155" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. As a result, this bacterium is now a global health threat [

 <xref rid="B93-molecules-26-00155" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. One approach to overcome this problem is to use essential plant oils that may represent a promising source for new resistance modifying agents [
 <xref rid="B93-molecules-26-00155" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. In our study, most of the oils were effective against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa.</italic> However, the antibacterial activity depends on the volatility of the chemical compounds present in these EOs [
 <xref rid="B94-molecules-26-00155" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. Indeed, the vapour generated by essential oils has a more significant antimicrobial effect than that of direct contact with these oils in liquid form. Lipophilic molecules in the aqueous phase could associate and form micelles which limit the fixation of EOs to microorganisms [
 <xref rid="B95-molecules-26-00155" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. According to Kloucek et al., there is variability in the phenomenon of essential oilsâ€™ volatility. Each EO presents a mixture of chemical compounds that have specific volatility. Each compound diffuses into the environment with its specific speed according to its molecular weight. The vapours interact together to reach an equilibrium that would allow the destruction of microorganisms, but only in a closed environment [
