<p>Due to the wide variation in the chemical profiles of 
 <italic>L. multiflora</italic> Mold. essential oils, the antibacterial activity is also well diversified in the literature [

Factors such as climatic and environmental conditions, the origin of the plant, the plant’s adaptive metabolism, the harvesting season, the part of the plant involved in the extraction, the distillation conditions, the microbiological methods used, as well as the susceptibility of the bacterial strains would make it difficult to compare the results obtained by different groups of researchers [
