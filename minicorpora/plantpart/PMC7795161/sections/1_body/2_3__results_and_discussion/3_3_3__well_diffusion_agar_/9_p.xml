<p>There are bacteriostatic (ration greater or equal to 2), bactericidal (whose ratio is between 1 and 2) and very bactericidal oils (whose ration is equal or less than 1) according to the calculated ratios. In the results of activity against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, different levels of activity were found with MIC values ranging from 42.52 ± 20.05 to 113.38 μg/mL and MBC values ranging from 47.24 ± 13.36 μg/mL to 170.07 ± 80.16μg/mL (see 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00155-t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>). L7 is the only oil that is bacteriostatic against bacteria. L1/L2/L6/L8a/L8b/L9b EOs are bactericidal, whereas L3/L4/L5/L9a are very bactericidal. For 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, the MIC values are from 85.04 ± 40.09 to 113.38 ± 0.00 μg/mL, and the MBC values are ranging from 85.04 ± 40.09 to 226.75 ± 0.00 μg/mL. The L6/L7/L8a are bacteriostatic, L3/L4/L6/L7/L8a bactericidal, and L1L2/L5/L8b/L9a/L9b very bactericidal EOs. The MIC values for 
 <italic>P. aeruginsa</italic> are between 42.52 ± 20.05 and 113.38 ± 0.00 μg/mL, and those for MBC are in the range 56.69 ± 0.00 and 226.75 ± 0.00μg/mL. The oils that have shown bacteriostatic effects are L4 and L7. The others, L5/L8b/L9a are bactericidal and L1/L2/L3/L6/L8a/L9b very bactericidal EOs.
