<p>In order to analyse the correlation between the chemical composition of the different essential oils and their antibacterial activity, the mean values of the diameters of the inhibition zones were subjected to a PCA and HCA analysis. First, we proceeded to the classification of essential oils according to the values of the diameters of the inhibition zones (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00155-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>): we have EO non-effective for a diameter equal to or less than 8 mm; effective (+) for a diameter between 8 and 14 mm; highly effective for a diameter between 14 and 20 mm and extremely effective for a diameter equal to or greater than 20 mm [

 <xref rid="B98-molecules-26-00155" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. The heat-map correlation of the

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-00155">Table S2</xref>. Mutual projections of factor scores and their loadings for the first three PCs have been presented in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00155-f010">Figure 10</xref>. Starting with 11 variables, the PCA calculated three components having eigenvalues greater than one and representing together 87.97% of the total variance. PC1 accounted for 33.91%, PC2 for 30.02% and PC3 for 24.04% of the variance (
