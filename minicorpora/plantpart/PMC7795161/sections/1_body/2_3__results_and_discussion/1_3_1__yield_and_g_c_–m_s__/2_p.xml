<p>In the present study, thirty-five compounds were identified with G.C.â€“M.S. analyses (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00155-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). A percentage of 67.50 to 100% of the total EOs composition of the flowers/leaves of 
 <italic>L. multiflora</italic> M were identified. It can be observed that the content (% of essential oil) of the determined compounds varies between EOs of the plants collected in the two provinces.
