 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00155-f003">Figure 3</xref>, the main compound classes represented in all EOs were monoterpene hydrocarbons, oxygenated monoterpenes, sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, and oxygenated sesquiterpenes. Monoterpene hydrocarbons are the most common compounds in EOs, with a proportion ranging from 19.60% to 93.82%. L8b, L8a, L7, L4, L5 and L9b respectively are the samples that contain the most of them. Next, the monoterpenes oxygenated compounds which are present from 0.00% to 52.90% in EOs. The highest detected concentrations of these compounds are in L1/L2. They are followed by sesquiterpenes hydrocarbons present in proportions ranging from 0 to 17.60%. L1/L2 are the most concentrated in these compounds. Finally, oxygenated sesquiterpenes are the least present in the different oils. L2 and L9a are the samples that contain the most (7.90% and 5.80% respectively).
