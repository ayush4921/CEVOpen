<p>According to the results (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00155-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), Piperitenone would also follow Limonene in almost all EOs profiles. Among the eleven samples, it is present in eight EOs at a rate of 11.58% to 34.83%. Trans-tagetone is also detected in L4, L5, L6, L7 and L8b, with a proportion ranging from 8.50% to 12.34%. The two compounds Neral and Citral are only present in the L1 (25.3%, 21.70%) and L2 (24.40%, 28.30%) samples, respectively. We also notice the presence of p-cymene in the L1 (10.40%), Carvacrol in L9a (11.50%) and a significant concentration of Ipsenone in L4 (19.40%). Artemisia ketone has been detected in L6 (20.30%) and L9a (28.30%) and is not a common compound in the genus 
 <italic>Lippia</italic>. It is most often found in different species of the genus Artemisia [
 <xref rid="B69-molecules-26-00155" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. As for verbenone, it is present in large quantities in only L3 (55.90%). It is a natural organic compound classified as bicyclic monoterpenoids that are found naturally in a variety of plants. Verbenone is a compound that has an odour and/or flavour of camphor, celery and menthol. It can be found in many food items such as spearmint, cabbage, white cabbage, and rosemary, which makes verbenone a potential biomarker for the consumption of these food products [
