<p>For further characterisation of the 
 <italic>Lippia</italic> EOs, the hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), followed by the heat-map using the abundance of individual volatiles were performed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00155-f007">Figure 7</xref>. The total HCA dendrogram (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00155-f007">Figure 7</xref>a) showed that the volatile profile of L4/L5/L6/L7 and L3/L9b were close to each other. Also, L2, L8a, and L9a are isolated from the others by their chemical profiles. The oil distribution is the same as shown by the PCs. The HCA results generated using the abundance of the volatile compounds (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00155-f007">Figure 7</xref>b) also showed variability between the populations from the two provinces, but also intraspecific variability between sub-groups within a population. This phenomenon has also been observed in several species of 
 <italic>Lippia</italic>, such as 
 <italic>L. origanoides</italic>, 
 <italic>L. alba</italic>, 
 <italic>L. lupulina</italic>, 
 <italic>L. velutina</italic>, 
 <italic>L. sidoides</italic>, 
 <italic>L. salviifolia</italic>, and 
 <italic>L. grata</italic> [

 <xref rid="B86-molecules-26-00155" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Furthermore, it should also be noted that for the L8/L9 plants, the EO chemical composition of their leaves (L8a/L9a) is different from that of their flowers (L8b/L9b). Indeed, the functioning of each organ can be independent of the others through authentic genetic machinery [

 <xref rid="B88-molecules-26-00155" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. The chemical composition of an essential oil varies considerably not only according to individual genetic variability but also according to the phenological stage and organ of the plant.
