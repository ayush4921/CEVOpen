<p>A principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted on the chemical content data for each 
 <italic>Lippia</italic> oil to obtain a basic overview of the data structure and to identify similarities and specific grouping patterns. Data raw (number of principal components (PCs) and per cent variance of the first three PCs) for eight PCA models are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-00155">Table S1</xref>. Mutual projections of factor scores and their loadings for the first three PCs have been presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00155-f004">Figure 4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00155-f005">Figure 5</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00155-f006">Figure 6</xref>. We obtained the following variance percentage for the principal components: 26.37% (PC1), 18.70% (PC2), and 11.21% (PC3) which resulted in a model that would explain approximately 56.28% of the total variance (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00155-f005">Figure 5</xref>) distinguishes three oils that come out of the sample batch (L2, L8a, L9a). The loading plots (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00155-f006">Figure 6</xref>) implies that the most influential compounds for discriminating L2 from other oils are γ-terpinene, Germacrene D, Elemol, Citral, Neral, Hedycaryol, and Zingiberene. The presence of a high concentration of Carvacrol and Artemisia Ketone separates L9a from the samples. Humulene oxide, Carvone, Trans-carveol, Trans-carvyl acetate and Caryophyllene oxide also contribute to the separation of L8a from the plants. Other oils (L1/L3/L4/L5/L6/L7/L8b/L9b), however, are joined into a single group by their common chemical composition, including Limonene, α-humulene, Ipsenone, Myrcene, p-cymene, Trans-tagetone, β-caryophyllene, Piperitenone and p-mentha-trans-2,8-dien-1-ol. We can also distinguish loading plot of Verbenone, Carveyl acetate and Vervenol in this group.
