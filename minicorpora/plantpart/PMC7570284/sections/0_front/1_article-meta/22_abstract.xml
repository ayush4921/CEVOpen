<abstract>
 <p>Essential oils have emerged as viable alternatives to synthetic insecticides for control of mosquito-borne pathogens. The leaf essential oils of eight species of 
  <italic>Premna</italic> (Lamiaceae) growing in central Vietnam have been obtained by hydrodistillation and analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. Sesquiterpene hydrocarbons dominated most of the 
  <italic>Premna</italic> essential oils, with the notable exception of 
  <italic>Premna</italic>
  <italic>mekongensis</italic> from Ngoc Linh Nature Reserve, which had α-pinene as the major component. Larvicidal activities against 
  <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> have been determined and all of the 
  <italic>Premna</italic> essential oils showed larvicidal activity with 24-h LC
  <sub>50</sub> &lt; 65 μg/mL. The leaf essential oils of 
  <italic>Premna</italic>
  <italic>cambodiana</italic> from Chu Mom Ray National Park and 
  <italic>Premna</italic>
  <italic>mekongensis</italic> from Ngoc Linh Nature Reserve showed the best larvicidal activities with 24-h LC
  <sub>50</sub> of 16.8 and 18.0 μg/mL, respectively. The essential oil compositions and larvicidal activities of 
  <italic>P. cambodiana</italic>, 
  <italic>Premna flavescens</italic>, 
  <italic>Premna</italic>
  <italic>maclurei</italic>, 
  <italic>P. mekongensis</italic>, and 
  <italic>Premna</italic>
  <italic>puberula</italic> are reported for the first time. Although the larvicidal activities of 
  <italic>Premna</italic> leaf essential oils are promising, the essential oil yields are relatively low (0.10–0.25%).
