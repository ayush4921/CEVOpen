<p>The 
 <italic>Premna</italic> leaf essential oils have been screened for mosquito larvicidal activity against 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and, if sufficient mosquito larvae were available, also against 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> and 
 <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic>. The 24-h and 48-h larvicidal activities are shown in 
 <xref rid="plants-09-01130-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="plants-09-01130-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>, respectively. Considering larvicidal activities against 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, the most active 
 <italic>Premna</italic> leaf essential oils were 
 <italic>P. cambodiana</italic> (24-h LC
 <sub>50</sub> = 16.8 μg/mL) and 
 <italic>P. mekongensis</italic> from Nghe An (24-h LC
 <sub>50</sub> = 16.8 μg/mL).
