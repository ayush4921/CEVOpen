<p>The major components in 
 <italic>P. cambodiana</italic> leaf essential oil were the sesquiterpene hydrocarbons α-copaene (23.3%), (
 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene (12.8%), and α-gurjunene (11.3%). (
 <italic>E</italic>)-Caryophyllene has shown larvicidal activity against 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> with reported LC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 38.6 μg/mL [
 <xref rid="B58-plants-09-01130" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] and 88.3 μg/mL [
 <xref rid="B59-plants-09-01130" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. As far as we are aware, there have been no reports on the larvicidal activities of either α-copaene or α-gurjunene. However, essential oils rich in α-copaene have shown notable larvicidal activity. For example, the essential oil from the inflorescences of 
 <italic>Piper marginatum</italic> Jacq. (Piperaceae) (9.4% α-copaene and 13.1% (
 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene) showed larvicidal activity against 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> with LC
 <sub>50</sub> of 19.9 μg/mL [
 <xref rid="B60-plants-09-01130" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]; the ripe peel essential oil of 
 <italic>Hymenaea courbaril</italic> L. (Fabaceae) (11.1% α-copaene) had an LC
 <sub>50</sub> of 14.8 μg/mL on 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> [
 <xref rid="B61-plants-09-01130" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Note, however, that the leaf essential oil of 
 <italic>P. corymbosa</italic> from Da Nang was also rich in α-copaene (8.1%) and (
 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene (13.3%), but the larvicidal activity against 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> was weaker (LC
 <sub>50</sub> = 61.8 μg/mL). Similarly, the leaf essential oil of 
 <italic>P. flavescens</italic> from Đồng Văn had α-gurjunene (19.6%) and (
 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene (11.8%) as major components, but also showed weak larvicidal activity against 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (LC
 <sub>50</sub> = 64.7 μg/mL). The mere presence of the sesquiterpene hydrocarbons α-copaene, α-gurjunene, and (
 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene is not sufficient to impart good larvicidal activity; there are likely synergistic effects of these compounds with minor components that account for the activities.
