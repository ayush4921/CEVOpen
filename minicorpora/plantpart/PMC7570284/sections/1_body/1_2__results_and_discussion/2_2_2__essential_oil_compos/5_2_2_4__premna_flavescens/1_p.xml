<p>Leaves of 
 <italic>P. flavescens</italic> were collected from two different sites (i.e., Nậm Giải Commune, Quế Phong district, Pu Hoat Nature Reserve, Nghe An province, and Đồng Văn Commune, Quế Phong District, Pu Hoat Nature Reserve, Nghe An province). The leaf essential oils from the two sites showed notable differences in compositions (

 <italic>E</italic>)-Caryophyllene was abundant in both samples (41.0% and 11.8% in the Nậm Giải and Đồng Văn samples, respectively), as was 
 <italic>trans</italic>-β-elemene (9.9% and 8.7%, respectively). The sample from Đồng Văn was rich in α-gurjunene (19.6%), but only a minor component (0.1%) in the sample from Nậm Giải. Likewise, α-guaiene and α-bulnesene were relatively abundant in the Đồng Văn sample (6.1% and 5.4%), but minor in the sample from Nậm Giải (0.5% and 0.2%, respectively). Interestingly, bicyclogermacrene (7.8%) and an unidentified component (RI 1759, 14.7%) in the sample from Nậm Giải, were not detected in the sample from Đồng Văn. Conversely, α-selinene, 8.7% in the sample from Đồng Văn, was not detected in the sample from Nậm Giải. As far as we are aware, there have been no previous reports on the essential oil chemistry of 
 <italic>P. flavescens</italic>.
