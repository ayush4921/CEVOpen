<p>Essential oils were obtained from leaves of 
 <italic>P. mekongensis</italic> from two different locations, Ngoc Linh Nature Reserve in Quang Nam Province, and Chu Mom Ray National Park. The leaf essential oil compositions are listed in 
 <xref rid="plants-09-01130-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The two samples showed very different compositions. The Ngoc Linh sample was dominated by α-pinene (66.9%) and (
 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene (14.7%). The leaf essential oil from Chu Mom Ray, on the other hand, had relatively low concentrations of α-pinene (1.5%) and (
 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene (3.9%). In addition, the Chu Mom Ray essential oil was much more complex with 95 identified components compared to only 37 in the Ngoc Linh sample. The high concentration of α-pinene in 
 <italic>P. mekongensis</italic> leaf essential oil from Ngoc Linh was unexpected and uncharacteristic of 
 <italic>Premna</italic> leaf essential oils, which are generally low in monoterpene hydrocarbon concentrations (see below). To our knowledge, there have been no previous studies on the essential oil composition of 
 <italic>P. mekongensis</italic>.
