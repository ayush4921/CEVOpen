0: The Lamiaceae has been an important family in terms of biologically active essential oils.
1: Essential oils from members of this family have demonstrated potential as natural insect pest control agents [ 24, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32].
2: The genus  Premna L. was formerly included in the family Verbenaceae, but has been reassigned to the Lamiaceae [ 33].
3: The genus is distributed in tropical regions of the Old World, from Africa, eastward through China, Southeast Asia and Malesia, to Australia and islands in the Pacific [ 34].
4: The number of species has been estimated to be as few as 50, or as many as 200 [ 34].
5: The ethnopharmacology, pharmacognosy, and phytochemistry of the genus have been reviewed [ 33, 35, 36, 37].
6: As part of our ongoing efforts in identifying readily-available essential oils for mosquito control, we have examined the leaf essential oils of eight species of  Premna ( Table 1) found growing wild in central Vietnam for larvicidal activity against  Aedes aegyptae,  Aedes albopictus, and  Culex quinquefasciatus.
7: Several of these  Premna species have been used traditionally in Vietnam ( Table 1).
