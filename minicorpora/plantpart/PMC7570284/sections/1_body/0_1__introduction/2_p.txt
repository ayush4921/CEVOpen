0: Insecticide resistance has been emerging in many insect disease vectors, including mosquitoes [ 10, 11, 12, 13, 14].
1: Furthermore, the environmental impacts of synthetic insecticides have been felt for many years [ 15, 16].
2: It has been reported that insecticide use has detrimental effects on non-target organisms, for example imidacloprid on honey bee ( Apis mellifera) [ 17], damselfly ( Ischnura senegalensis) [ 18], fathead minnow ( Pimephales promelas), or the amphipod ( Hyalella azteca) [ 19].
3: Thus, there is a need for new and complementary methods for controlling insect vectors, and essential oils have shown promise as renewable and environmentally-safe alternatives to the use of synthetic insecticides [ 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25].
