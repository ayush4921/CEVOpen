<p>Larvicidal activities of the 
 <italic>Premna</italic> essential oils were determined following the protocol previously reported [
 <xref rid="B62-plants-09-01130" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]: 250-mL beakers, 150 mL of water, and 20 larvae (fourth instar), aliquots of the 
 <italic>Premna</italic> essential oils dissolved in EtOH (1% stock solution) were added to give final concentrations of 100, 50, 25, 12.5, and 6 μg/mL; EtOH only (negative control) and permethrin (positive control), mortality recorded after 24 h and 48 h of exposure, experiments were carried out at 25 ± 2 °C, each test was conducted with four replicates. The data obtained were subjected to log-probit analysis [

 <sub>50</sub> values, LC
 <sub>90</sub> values and 95% confidence limits using Minitab
