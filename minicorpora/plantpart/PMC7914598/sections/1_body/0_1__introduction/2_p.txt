0: Among plant secondary metabolites, essential oils (EOs), biosynthesized by glandular trichomes and other secretory structures in plants, are liquids particularly rich in volatile molecules such as monoterpene and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, oxygenated monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, esters, aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, phenols, and oxides [ 2, 3, 4].
1: The chemical composition of EOs can vary from plant to plant and even in the same species and depends on several factors such as post-harvest conservation conditions [ 5], extraction methods [ 6, 7, 8] and times [ 9, 10], microclimate, and site in which the plant is growing [ 11, 12].
2: EOs contribute to the plant relations with environment and with other organisms, and humans and animals take advantage of the abundance of such bioactive molecules from the plant kingdom [ 4].
3: Numerous papers deal with the biological activities of the EOs such as antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, antibacterial and antifungal activities, immunomodulatory effects, and cytotoxic activities against different cancer cell lines [ 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19].
4: Gymnosperms, the Cupressaceae, and the Pinaceae families produce economically important EOs [ 20].
5: The Pinaceae family is the largest family of non-flowering seed plants and comprises 11 genera and approximately 230 species of trees, rarely shrubs, which are widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere [ 21, 22].
6: The biological activities of Pinaceae EOs reflect the richness in their chemical composition.
7: Antioxidant, antibacterial, antifungal, insect larvicidal, anti-inflammatory, and antiproliferative activities are reported for different genus of the Pinaceae family [ 16, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30].
