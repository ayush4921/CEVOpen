<p>Among plant secondary metabolites, essential oils (EOs), biosynthesized by glandular trichomes and other secretory structures in plants, are liquids particularly rich in volatile molecules such as monoterpene and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, oxygenated monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, esters, aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, phenols, and oxides [

 <xref rid="B4-pharmaceuticals-14-00134" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The chemical composition of EOs can vary from plant to plant and even in the same species and depends on several factors such as post-harvest conservation conditions [

 <xref rid="B12-pharmaceuticals-14-00134" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. EOs contribute to the plant relations with environment and with other organisms, and humans and animals take advantage of the abundance of such bioactive molecules from the plant kingdom [
 <xref rid="B4-pharmaceuticals-14-00134" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Numerous papers deal with the biological activities of the EOs such as antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, antibacterial and antifungal activities, immunomodulatory effects, and cytotoxic activities against different cancer cell lines [

 <xref rid="B22-pharmaceuticals-14-00134" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The biological activities of Pinaceae EOs reflect the richness in their chemical composition. Antioxidant, antibacterial, antifungal, insect larvicidal, anti-inflammatory, and antiproliferative activities are reported for different genus of the Pinaceae family [
