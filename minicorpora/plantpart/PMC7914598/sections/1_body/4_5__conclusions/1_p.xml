<p>In this study, for the first time, the chemical composition of the liquid and vapor phase of four Pinaceae EOs was investigated by the HS-GC/MS technique. The results of analyses showed that these EOs are rich in monoterpenoids and highlight that Î±-pinene, one of the main compounds, is more abundant in the vapor phase of each oil than in the liquid phase. The antimicrobial and antioxidant activities were also reported and compared. The vapor phase of each EO resulted more active against the investigated bacterial strains.</p>
