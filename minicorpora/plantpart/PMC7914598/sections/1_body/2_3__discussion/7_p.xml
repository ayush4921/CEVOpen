<p>The antibacterial activities of the four Pinaceae EOs were also confirmed by agar diffusion and disk volatilization methods by which the IZ and vapor IZ were measured in mm of inhibition halos. For all the tested EOs, the vapor phases were more active than the liquid phases, showing the inhibition halos from 41.00 ± 10.15 mm to 80.00 ± 0.00 mm for three bacterial strains (
 <italic>A. bohemicus</italic>, 
 <italic>K. marina</italic>, and 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic>). Concerning 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>P. fluorescens</italic>, a very low or null activity was reported. The results showed high activities of the EOs against 
 <italic>A. bohemicus</italic>, 
 <italic>K. marina</italic>, and 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> and a scarce or null activity against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>P. fluorescens</italic>. The highest activities obtained by vapor phases of all EOs against 
 <italic>A. bohemicus</italic>, 
 <italic>K. marina</italic>, and 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> could be related with the presence of α-pinene. In the graph bar (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceuticals-14-00134-f001">Figure 1</xref>), the relative percentages of α-pinene were reported. It reached higher percentages in the vapor phase than in the liquid phase of all investigated EOs. In particular, liquid and vapor phase values were as follows: (44.0% vs. 65.6%), (16.6% vs. 31.6%), (20.2% vs. 35.5%), and (30.8% vs. 51.3%), in 
 <italic>P. cembra</italic>, 
 <italic>P. mugo</italic>, 
 <italic>P. abies</italic>, and 
 <italic>A. alba</italic> EOs respectively. These results suggest that α-pinene could play an important role for the detected antibacterial activity. Some papers reported α-pinene from Pinaceae EOs as the main compound showing good biological activity; it was the principal constituent (5.2–37.0%) in five Moroccan Pinus species EOs [
 <xref rid="B50-pharmaceuticals-14-00134" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and in 
 <italic>Pinus peuce</italic> Griseb. EOs (12.89–27.34%) growing on three different locations in R. Macedonia [
