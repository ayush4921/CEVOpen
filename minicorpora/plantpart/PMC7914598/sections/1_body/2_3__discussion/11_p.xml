<p>The variety of compounds that are present in the investigated EOs confers them numerous biological properties, and their antioxidant activities could be related to the presence of monoterpenes. Wang et al. [
 <xref rid="B62-pharmaceuticals-14-00134" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] studied the antioxidant activities of seven terpenoids found in wine, and among the tested compounds, α-pinene and limonene had the highest DPPH free radical scavenging and the highest reducing power. Wojtunik-Kulesza [
