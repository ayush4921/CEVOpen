<p>Different studies confirmed the antibacterial properties of α-pinene [

 <xref rid="B53-pharmaceuticals-14-00134" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] reported that α-pinene has antibacterial and antibiotic-modulating activities against 
 <italic>S. aureus;</italic> it also increases the activity of norfloxacin against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and norfloxacin and gentamicin against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Furthermore, Hippeli et al. [
 <xref rid="B54-pharmaceuticals-14-00134" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] described an anti-inflammatory potential of 
 <italic>P. mugo</italic> EOs and its main compound α-pinene, while Cole et al. [
 <xref rid="B55-pharmaceuticals-14-00134" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] showed anti-proliferative activity on the MCF-7 cell line. On the other hand, Kurti et al. [
 <xref rid="B37-pharmaceuticals-14-00134" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] attributed the antimicrobial activities of some Pinus species EOs from Kosovo to the hexane/diethyl ether fractions, which were mainly composed by oxygenated monoterpenes.
