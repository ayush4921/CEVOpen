<p>The increase of antibiotically resistance phenomenon in human and animal pathologies has determined the intensification of research on new natural antimicrobial substances [

 <xref rid="B47-pharmaceuticals-14-00134" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], and in this view, several studies were carried out to investigate the biological activities of Pinaceae EOs and the roles of their molecules. 
 <italic>P. abies</italic> EO extracted by supercritical carbon dioxide was investigated for antimicrobial properties on 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> using the isothermal calorimetry technique, and it inhibited the growth and interfered with the metabolic activity of the microorganism [

 <xref rid="B49-pharmaceuticals-14-00134" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] determined the antibacterial activities of the essential oils of young pine shoots on different bacterial strains also from human patients, and significant activities were revealed against G+ bacteria strains and 
 <italic>Candida</italic> species tested. Apetrei et al. [
 <xref rid="B25-pharmaceuticals-14-00134" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] reported that needles and twigs essential oils of 
 <italic>Pinus cembra</italic> showed high activity against 
 <italic>Sarcina lutea</italic> and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and no activity against 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic>,
