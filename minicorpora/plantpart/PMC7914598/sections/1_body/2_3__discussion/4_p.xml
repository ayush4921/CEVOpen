<p>The chemical composition of 
 <italic>A. alba</italic> EO showed two components such as limonene and α-pinene with a similar percentage (32.5% and 30.8%) followed by camphene (11.2%) and β-pinene (7.5%). The same compounds were listed with an inverted trend in 
 <italic>A. alba</italic> EO from Montenegro where β-pinene (32.8%) was the major component followed by α-pinene (17.3%) and camphene (16.7%) [

 <italic>A. alba</italic> EO from seeds and cones respectively [

 <italic>A. alba</italic> EO from Poland, limonene was the component with the higher percentage (82.9%) detected in seed EO, whereas α-pinene (50.0%) was the main component in cone EO [

 <xref rid="B44-pharmaceuticals-14-00134" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and on the basis of the reported data, it becomes evident that the chemical composition of the EOs from species belonging to the Pinaceae family can depend by multiple factors such as part of the plant examined, its geographic origin, and also, extraction methods and storage [
