<p>The chemical profile of both the vapor and liquid phase and the antibacterial and antioxidant activities of four Pinaceae EOs, obtained from needles by steam distillation, were investigated using different kinds of techniques and assays. In the literature, a few papers reporting the Pinaceae EOs chemical composition are present, and no report describes the volatile composition of the vapor phase of the conifer-derived EOs by HS-GC/MS, as we applied for our investigation. In our investigations, the chemical constituents resulted primarily monoterpenoids and their contents were higher in the vapor phases of 
 <italic>P. cembra</italic> (99.9%) and 
 <italic>P. mugo</italic> (100.0%) EOs than the vapor phases of the 
 <italic>P. abies</italic> (97.9%) and 
 <italic>A. alba</italic> (95.8%) EOs. The major compounds of the 
 <italic>P. cembra</italic> EO were α-pinene (44.0%), γ-terpinene (19.7%), limonene (14.8%), and β-pinene (12.5%). Similar composition was described by Lis et al. [
 <xref rid="B32-pharmaceuticals-14-00134" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], where the needle oil was dominated by α-pinene (48.4%), limonene (7.5%), and β-phellanderene (3.1%); α-pinene was also the major component (69.14%) in needle EO of 
 <italic>P. cembra</italic> growing in Romania [
 <xref rid="B33-pharmaceuticals-14-00134" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The composition of the EO from twig tips with needles of the 
 <italic>P. cembra</italic> L. growing in Salzburg Alps was represented by α-pinene (43.9–48.3%), β-phellandrene (13.1–17.2%), and β-pinene (6.6–9.3%) [
 <xref rid="B34-pharmaceuticals-14-00134" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. 
 <italic>Pinus cembra</italic> needles EO from Slovakia consisted of α-pinene (53.2%), limonene (11.4%), and β-phellandrene (9.4%) [
