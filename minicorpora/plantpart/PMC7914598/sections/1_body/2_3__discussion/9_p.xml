<p>In the present study, the susceptibility of bacteria does not seem to be related with the features of the cell Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria wall structure, since the more sensitive bacteria strains, 
 <italic>A. bohemicus</italic>, 
 <italic>K. marina</italic>, and 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> do not belong to the same group. Generally, Gram-negative are more resistant than Gram-positive bacteria, because the cell wall does not allow the entrance into the cell of hydrophobic molecules present in the essential oils [

Different mechanisms of action can explain the EOs antimicrobial activities, and their wide variety of molecular components can act at multiple levels [
