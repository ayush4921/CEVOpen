<p>The radical scavenging activities of the Pinaceae essential oils were also calculated using the ABTS (2,2′-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt) assay described by Re et al. [
 <xref rid="B69-pharmaceuticals-14-00134" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] with some modifications. The radical cation ABTS+• was produced by reacting ABTS aqueous solution (7 mM) with K
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>8</sub> (140 mM) following an incubation for 16 h in the dark at room temperature before use. The ABTS+• solution was diluted with ethanol to reach an absorbance of 0.70 ± 0.02 at 734 nm, and 1980 µL was mixed with 20 µL of the essential oil dilutions in ethanol. The resulting solutions were incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Afterwards, the absorbances were measured at 734 nm using a Jasco V-630 UV-Visible spectrophotometer and using Spectra Manager
 <sup>TM</sup> software. Furthermore, the absorbance of the ABTS+• blank, consisting of 20 µL of ethanol dissolved in 1980 µL of ABTS+• solution, was measured. The assay was repeated three times.
