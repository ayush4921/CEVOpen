<p>In DPPH radical scavenging assay, the Pinaceae essential oils antioxidant activities were calculated against the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrilidrazil radical (DPPH•) using the method described by Sanchez-Moreno et al. [
 <xref rid="B68-pharmaceuticals-14-00134" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. First, 100 µL of fresh solution of a solid crystalline DPPH• (0.2 mM) in methanol were added to 100 µL of 12 geometric dilutions in methanol of each essential oil inside a 96-well plate. Geometric dilutions of the samples in methanol were used as sample blanks. In blank DPPH samples, essential oils were omitted. As a positive control, dilutions were prepared starting from Trolox solution (1 mM) in methanol. The samples were incubated for 30 min in the dark at room temperature, and the absorbances decreases were measured at 517 nm using a Tecan Sunrise
 <sup>TM</sup> UV-vis spectrophotometer. The assay was repeated three times.
