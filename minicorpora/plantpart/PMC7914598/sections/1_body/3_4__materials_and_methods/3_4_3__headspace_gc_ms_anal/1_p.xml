<p>The volatile chemical profile of essential oils was carried out with a Perkin Elmer Headspace Turbomatrix 40 (Waltham, MA, USA) autosampler connected to GC-MS [

 <xref rid="B65-pharmaceuticals-14-00134" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. One mL of the each EO was placed in 20 mL vials sealed with headspace PTFE-coated silicone rubber septa and caps. To optimize the headspace procedure for the determination of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), more operative parameters were optimized. The gas phase of the sealed vials was equilibrated for 20 min at 60 Â°C and was followed immediately by compound desorption into GC injector in splitless mode. Quantification of compounds was performed by GC-FID in the same conditions described in the previous paragraph.
