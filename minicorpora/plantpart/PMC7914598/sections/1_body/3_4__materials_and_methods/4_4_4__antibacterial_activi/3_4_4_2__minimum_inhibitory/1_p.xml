<p>The MIC is defined as the lowest concentration of antimicrobial agent that completely inhibits the growth of the microorganism as detected by the unaided eye and was carried out according to the microwell dilution method. Briefly, 12 dilutions of the four essential oils in LB broth (for

 <italic>P. mugo</italic> from 52.16 to 0.01 mg/mL; for 
 <italic>A. alba</italic> form 51.28 to 0.01 mg/mL and for 
 <italic>P. abies</italic> from 53.12 to 0.01 mg/mL), a control with the same percentage of DMSO (from 6.25% to 0.003%) in Lysogeny broth, a growth control without treatments, a positive control with gentamicin diluted from 100 to 0.05 µg/mL, and a sterility control without bacteria were plated on 96 microwell plates. Then, 50 µL of bacterial inoculum, 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU/mL, were added in each well, except for the sterility control, and the plates were incubated for 24 h at the corresponding temperature. The visualization of the inhibition activity was obtained by 20 µL of a solution of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (200 µg/mL, MTT) added to each well. The assay was carried out in triplicate. The MBC/MIC ratio was reported to interpret the activity of the essential oil, and an antimicrobial agent is considered bacteriostatic when the ratio MBC/MIC &gt; 4 and bactericidal when the ratio MBC/MIC is ≤4 [
