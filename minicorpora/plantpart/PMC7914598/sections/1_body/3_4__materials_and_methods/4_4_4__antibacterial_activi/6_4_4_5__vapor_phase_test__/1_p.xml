 <sup>8</sup> CFU/mL was plated on the LB agar medium. Then, 10 ÂµL of tested essential oils were added to a 6 mm sterile disk and placed on agar in the covered Petri plate. Liquid LB agar was put in the space between the cover and the base of the Petri dishes to facilitate the sealing and to prevent any vapor leakage. The Petri plates were incubated for 24 h in an inverted position, and afterwards, the inhibition halos were measured. Negative controls were carried out without the essential. All VPTs were carried out in triplicate.
