 <sup>8</sup> Colony-Forming Unit/mL—CFU/mL) and then plated on LB broth with agar in a Petri plate. Sterile disks (6 mm diameter, Oxoid) were placed on the agar and impregnated with 10 µL of samples. Two µL of gentamicin from a stock solution (10 mg/mL) was used as a positive control After 24 h, the inhibitory activities of each essential oil were recorded as mm of halo diameter without growth [
