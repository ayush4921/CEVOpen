<p>Five bacterial strains from the culture collections of the Plant Cytology and Biotechnology Laboratory of Tuscia University were tested to evaluate the antibacterial activities of 
 <italic>P. cembra</italic> L., 
 <italic>P. mugo</italic> Turra, 
 <italic>A. alba</italic> M., and 
 <italic>P. abies</italic> L. essential oils: 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> ATCC 25922, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic> ATCC 13525, and 
 <italic>Acinetobacter bohemicus</italic> DSM 102855 among Gram-negative and 
 <italic>Kocuria marina</italic> DSM 16420 and 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> ATCC 10876 among Gram-positive. All tested bacterial strains were maintained on LB broth (10 g tryptone, 5 g yeast extract, 10 g NaCl per liter, autoclaved at 121 °C for 20 min) with agar. Bacteria cultures were maintained at two different temperatures: 26 °C for 
 <italic>P. fluorescens</italic>, 
 <italic>A. bohemicus,</italic> and 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> and 37 °C for 
 <italic>K. marina</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. All inocula were prepared with fresh cultures plated the day before the test.
