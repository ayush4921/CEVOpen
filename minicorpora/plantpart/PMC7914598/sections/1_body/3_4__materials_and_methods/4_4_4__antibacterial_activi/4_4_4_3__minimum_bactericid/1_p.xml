<p>To verify the lowest concentration at which the tested essential oils kill the bacterial cells, which is defined the Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC), 10 ÂµL of the last four dilutions from microwell dilution method in which no bacteria growth was observed were plated on a Petri plate with LB agar and incubated for 24 h. The concentration at which no growth on agar was observed defined MBC values. The assay was carried out in triplicate.</p>
