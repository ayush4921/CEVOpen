 <italic>P. abies</italic> EO antibacterial activity is reported in 
 <xref rid="pharmaceuticals-14-00134-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. MIC and MBC values were 53.12 mg/mL for 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>P. fluorescens,</italic> and 
 <italic>K. marina</italic>. For 
 <italic>A. bohemicus</italic>, a lower MIC value was observed (13.28 mg/mL), whereas MBC was 26.56 mg/mL. The antibacterial activity for 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> was 26.56 mg/mL and 53.12 mg/mL for the MIC and MBC values, respectively. As obtained by the MBC/MIC ratio, 
 <italic>P. abies</italic> EO was bactericidal against all bacterial strains. No effects were observed by the disc diffusion assay and by the vapor phase test for 
 <italic>P. abies</italic> EO on 
 <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. IZ and vapor IZ values were 18.67 ± 1.53 mm and 76.67 ± 5.77 mm for 
 <italic>A. bohemicus</italic>, 9.67 ± 1.15 mm and 80.00 ± 0.00 mm for 
 <italic>K. marina</italic> and 11.67 ± 1.53 mm and 80.00 ± 0.00 mm for 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic>, respectively. The 
 <italic>P. abies</italic> EO vapor phase was more active rather than the liquid phase against 
 <italic>A. bohemicus</italic>, 
 <italic>K. marina</italic>, and 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic>.
