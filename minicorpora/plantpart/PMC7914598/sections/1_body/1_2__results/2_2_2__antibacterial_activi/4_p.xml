<p>The results for 
 <italic>A. alba</italic> antibacterial activity are reported in 
 <xref rid="pharmaceuticals-14-00134-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>. MIC and MBC values were 51.28 mg/mL for 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>P. fluorescens</italic>, and 
 <italic>K. marina</italic>. Lower MIC and MBC values were found for 
 <italic>A. bohemicus</italic> and for 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> (12.82 mg/mL and 25.64 mg/mL, respectively). The MBC/MIC ratio defined as bactericidal the 
 <italic>A. alba</italic> EO against all bacterial strains. No effects were observed in the disc diffusion assay and in the vapor phase test for 
 <italic>A. alba</italic> EO on 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>P. fluorescens</italic>. Higher antibacterial activity was detected for the other bacterial strains: IZ and vapor IZ values were 19.67 ± 0.58 mm and 80.00 ± 00 mm for 
 <italic>A. bohemicus</italic>, 7.67 ± 1.15 and 80.00 ± 0.00 for 
 <italic>K. marina</italic>, and 15.00 ± 2.65 and 66.67 ± 11.55 for 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic>, respectively. The vapor phase test revealed that the activities of the 
 <italic>A. alba</italic> EO against 
 <italic>A. bohemicus</italic>, 
 <italic>K. marina,</italic> and 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> were higher than those of the liquid phase.
