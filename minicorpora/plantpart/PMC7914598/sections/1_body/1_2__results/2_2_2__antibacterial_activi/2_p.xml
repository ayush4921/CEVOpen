 <xref rid="pharmaceuticals-14-00134-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> summarizes the antibacterial tests for 
 <italic>P. mugo</italic> EO. MIC and MBC values were 52.16 mg/mL for 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>P. fluorescens</italic>, and 
 <italic>K. marina</italic>, while MIC and MBC values were 26.08 mg/mL for 
 <italic>A. bohemicus</italic> and MIC and MBC values were 26.08 mg/mL and 52.16 mg/mL for 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic>, respectively. The MBC/MIC ratio defined as bactericidal the 
 <italic>P. mugo</italic> EO against all bacterial strains. No effects were observed by the disc diffusion assay and by the vapor phase test for 
 <italic>P. cembra</italic> EO on 
 <italic>P. fluorescens</italic>. 
 <italic>P. mugo</italic> EO was not highly active against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> with an IZ value of 9.67 ± 0.58 mm, while no growth inhibition zone was observed by the vapor phase test. Higher antibacterial activity was observed for the other bacterial strains: IZ and vapor IZ values were 25.33 ± 4.51 mm and 41.00 ± 10.15 mm for 
 <italic>A. bohemicus</italic>, 11.33 ± 1.15 mm and 80.00 ± 0.00 mm for 
 <italic>K. marina</italic>, and 15.67 ± 1.15 mm and 76.67 ± 5.77 mm for 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic>, respectively. The 
 <italic>P. mugo</italic> EO vapor phase was more active than the liquid phase against 
 <italic>A. bohemicus</italic>, 
 <italic>K. marina</italic>, and 
 <italic>B. cereus.</italic>
