<p>The antibacterial activities of the Pinaceae EOs were evaluated for three Gram-negative (
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic>, and 
 <italic>Acinetobacter bohemicus</italic>) and two Gram-positive bacteria (
 <italic>Kocuria marina</italic> and 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> using micro dilution assay to determine Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and the Minimal Bactericidal Concentration (MBC), and the MBC/MIC ratio defines an agent as bacteriostatic when the MBC/MIC ratio &gt; 4 and as bactericidal when the MBC/MIC ratio ≤ 4 [
 <xref rid="B31-pharmaceuticals-14-00134" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Furthermore, the disc diffusion assay by contact with the essential oil determined the diameter of bacterial growth inhibition zone (IZ), and the vapor phase test determined the antibacterial growth inhibition zone (Vapor IZ) by more volatile molecules of the EO in a preservative atmosphere. The antibacterial results of the tested EOs are summarized in

 <xref rid="pharmaceuticals-14-00134-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, the treatment with 
 <italic>P. cembra</italic> EO showed MIC and MBC values of 53.12 mg/mL for 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>P. fluorescens</italic>, and 
 <italic>K. marina</italic>, while MIC values were 26.56 mg/mL for 
 <italic>A. bohemicus</italic> and 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic>, and MBC values were 26.56 mg/mL and 53.12 mg/mL, respectively. MBC/MIC ratio defined the 
 <italic>P. cembra</italic> EO as bactericidal against all bacterial strains. No effects were observed with the disc diffusion assay and with the vapor phase test for 
 <italic>P. cembra</italic> EO against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>P. fluorescens</italic>. The IZ and vapor IZ values were 17.67 ± 0.58 mm and 67.33 ± 2.52 mm for 
 <italic>A. bohemicus</italic>, 9.33 ± 0.58 mm and 80.00 ± 0.00 mm for 
 <italic>K. marina</italic>, and 11.67 ± 1.15 mm and 80.00 ± 0.00 mm for 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic>, respectively.
