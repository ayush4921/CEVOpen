<p>To determine the antioxidant activity of the four Pinaceae EOs, 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging activity and 2,2′-azinobis (3- ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) radical scavenging assay, based on the reaction of the potential antioxidant with colored radicals, were carried out. The antioxidant activity results are reported in 
 <xref rid="pharmaceuticals-14-00134-t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>. In all EOs, a concentration-dependent antioxidant capacity was found. In both tests, 
 <italic>P. mugo</italic> EO showed the highest antioxidant activity than the other Pinaceae EOs. This EO exhibits lower IC
 <sub>50</sub> values (3.08 µg/mL and 43.08 µg/mL for DPPH and ABTS assays, respectively) and higher TEAC values (7.65 mol/mg and 14.01 mol/mg for DPPH and ABTS assays, respectively). The second effective essential oil was the 
 <italic>A. alba</italic> EO with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 7.84 µg/mL and 44.23 µg/mL and TEAC values of 1.63 mol/mg and 13.26 mol/mg in the DPPH method and ABTS method, respectively. The TEAC values of 
 <italic>P. cembra</italic> and 
 <italic>P. abies</italic> EOs were almost identical: 1.63 mol/mg and 1.68 mol/mg in the DPPH assay, respectively and 13.26 mol/mg for both the EOs in the ABTS assay. Taking into account the ABTS test, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> amount was 44.90 µg/mL in 
 <italic>P. cembra</italic> EO and 45.00 µg/mL in 
 <italic>A. alba</italic> EO. In the DPPH test, both EOs showed similar IC
 <sub>50</sub> values, too (13.01 µg/mL for 
 <italic>P. cembra</italic> and 13.05 µg/mL for 
 <italic>P. abies</italic>). 
 <italic>A. alba</italic> EO remains the least effective in antioxidant capacity of the analyzed Pinaceae EOs.
