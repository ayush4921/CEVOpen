<p>Twenty-one components were identified in 
 <italic>P. abies</italic> and 
 <italic>A. alba</italic> EOs, and they are listed in 
 <xref rid="pharmaceuticals-14-00134-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. β-Pinene was the principal compound in 
 <italic>P. abies</italic> EO (20.2% when using GC/MS and 34.5% when using HS/GC-MS), while α-pinene (30.8% GC/MS; 51.3% HS/GC-MS) was the principal compound in 
 <italic>P. abies</italic> EO. The second most abundant component was α-pinene (20.2% and 34.5%) in 
 <italic>P. abies</italic> EO and limonene (32.5% and 19.0%) in 
 <italic>A. alba</italic> EO when using GC/MS and HS/GC-MS, respectively. p-Cymene (0.2%; 0.1%), camphor (1.2%; 0.2%), and borneol (2.1%; 0.2%) were detected only in the liquid and vapor phase, respectively of 
 <italic>P. abies</italic> EOs. α-Himachalene (0.3%), citronellol acetate (0.4%), humulene (1.6%), and caryophyllene oxide (0.1) appeared only in the liquid phase of 
 <italic>A. alba</italic> EO. Lastly, in the vapor phase of both EOs, the components from N° 12 to N° 21 were missing except for borneol (0.2%), which was detected in 
 <italic>P. abies</italic> EO.
