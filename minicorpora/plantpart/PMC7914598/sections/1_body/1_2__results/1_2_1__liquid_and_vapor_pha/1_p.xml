<p>By Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) and Headspace (HS)-GC/MS analysis, the composition of the vapor and liquid phase of all EOs was described. Twenty components were identified in 
 <italic>P. cembra</italic> and 
 <italic>P. mugo</italic> EOs, and they are listed in 
 <xref rid="pharmaceuticals-14-00134-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The most abundant component was α-pinene (44.0% when using GC/MS and 65.6% when using HS/GC-MS) followed by γ-terpinene (19.7% GC/MS; 11.0% HS/GC-MS), limonene (14.8% GC/MS and 8.2%; HS/GC-MS) and β-pinene (12.5% GC/MS; 12.4% HS/GC-MS) in 
 <italic>P. cembra</italic> EO. On the contrary, β-pinene (43.3% GC/MS; 42.3% HS/GC-MS) was the major compound in 
 <italic>P. mugo</italic>. EO followed by α-pinene (16.6% GC/MS; 31.6% HS/GC-MS) and limonene (9.5% GC/MS; 7.8% HS/GC-MS). β-Phellandrene (16.0%) as well as other minor compounds such as p-cymenene (0.1%), copaene (0.1%), and bornyl acetate (3.0%) appeared only in the liquid phase of 
 <italic>P. mugo</italic> EO. On the other hand, α-phellandrene (0.7%) was detected only in 
 <italic>P. mugo</italic> vapor phase EO. In particular, in the vapor phase of both EOs, the components from N° 11 to N° 20 were missing except for β-caryophyllene (0.1%), which was detected in 
 <italic>P. mugo</italic> EO.
