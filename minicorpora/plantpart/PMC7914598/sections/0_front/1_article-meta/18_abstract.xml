 <p>In this study, the chemical composition of the vapor and liquid phase of 
  <italic>Pinus cembra</italic> L., 
  <italic>Pinus mugo</italic> Turra, 
  <italic>Picea abies</italic> L., and 
  <italic>Abies Alba</italic> M. needles essential oils (EOs) was investigated by Headspace-Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (HS-GC/MS). In the examined EOs, a total of twenty-eight components were identified, most of which belong to the monoterpenes family. α-Pinene (16.6–44.0%), β-pinene (7.5–44.7%), limonene (9.5–32.5%), and γ-terpinene (0.3–19.7%) were the most abundant components of the liquid phase. Such major compounds were also detected in the vapor phase of all EOs, and α-pinene reached higher relative percentages than in the liquid phase. Then, both the liquid and vapor phases were evaluated in terms of antibacterial activity against three Gram-negative bacteria (
  <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
  <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic>, and 
  <italic>Acinetobacter bohemicus</italic>) and two Gram-positive bacteria (
  <italic>Kocuria marina</italic> and 
  <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic>) using a microwell dilution assay, disc diffusion assay, and vapor phase test. The lowest Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) (13.28 mg/mL) and Minimal Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) (26.56 mg/mL) values, which correspond to the highest antibacterial activities, were reported for 
  <italic>P. abies</italic> EO against 
  <italic>A. bohemicus</italic> and for 
  <italic>A. alba</italic> EO against 
  <italic>A. bohemicus</italic> and 
  <italic>B. cereus</italic>. The vapor phase of all the tested EOs was more active than liquid phase, showing the inhibition halos from 41.00 ± 10.15 mm to 80.00 ± 0.00 mm for three bacterial strains (
  <italic>A. bohemicus</italic>, 
  <italic>K. marina</italic>, and 
  <italic>B. cereus</italic>). Furthermore, antioxidant activities were also investigated by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2′-azinobis (3- ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) assays, and a concentration-dependent antioxidant capacity for all EOs was found. 
  <italic>P. mugo</italic> EO showed the best antioxidant activity than the other Pinaceae EOs. The four Pinaceae EOs could be further investigated for their promising antibacterial and antioxidant properties, and, in particular, α-pinene seems to have interesting possibilities for use as a novel natural antibacterial agent.
