<p>In the literature, there has been limited work related to the volatile constituents (EO, SPME, and n-hexane extract) of some 
 <italic>Serapias</italic> species ( 
 <italic>Serapias vomeracea</italic> (Burm. F.) B.; 
 <italic>Serapias vomeracea</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>longipetala</italic> (Ten.) H. Baumann &amp; Künkele; 
 <italic>Serapias cordigera</italic> L. subsp. 
 <italic>cordigera</italic> ; 
 <italic>Serapias cordigera</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>lucana</italic> R. Lorenz &amp; V.A. Romano; 
 <italic>Serapias parviflora</italic> Parl.; 
 <italic>Serapias lingua</italic> L.; 
 <italic>Serapias lingua</italic> L.) [18–20]. The essential oil of 
 <italic>S. vomeracea</italic> has been shown to have dose-dependent antioxidant effects through DPPH assay [18]. Some orchid species are known to exhibit antimicrobial and antioxidant biological activity [18,21]. However, to the best of our knowledge from the literature survey, no data about chemical compositions and biological activities of 
 <italic>S.orientalis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>orientalis</italic> (Greuter) H.Baumann &amp; Künkele have been reported to date. The subject of this study is to investigate the effect of different extraction methods. Therefore, in this paper, we report various volatile constituents of EO, SPME, and SPMEs of 
 <italic>n</italic> -hexane, methanol, and water extracts analyzed with GC-FID/MS.Antimicrobial activities of the extracts ( 
 <italic>n</italic> -hexane, methanol, and water) and EO against 9 microorganisms are evaluated. In addition, porcine pancreatic lipase (PPL) enzyme activity of EO and solvent extracts was investigated. The results of antimicrobial and porcine pancreatic lipase activities of EO and the solvent extracts ( 
 <italic>n</italic> -hexane, methanol, and water) may be useful in foods, pharmaceuticals, and other industries.
