0: Orchidaceae is among the richest plant families, with more than 25,000 species worldwide.
1: Serapias L. is a genus of the Orchidaceae family which occurs from the easterncentral and eastern Mediterranean to the western Transcaucasusand is represented by 30 common taxa [13].
2: There are 23 species of Orchidaceae and 30 of the 170 endemic taxa growing in Turkey [2,3].
3: Some of the Orchidaceae species have been used as herbal medicines to treat headaches, dizziness, tetanus, and epilepsy.
4: Some orchid species have been shown to exert sedative, anticonvulsive, and antiepileptic effects, as listed in the oldest Chinese materia medica [4,5].
5: In recent years, the neuroprotective functions of some Orchidaceae species are one of their traditional uses [6].
6: It is also used in perfumes, cosmetics, and aromatherapy.
7: The orchids used in sahlep production are usually adapted to terrestrial and mild climate regions.
8: Sahlep is generally used as a traditional beverage or food additive.
9: Its use is very common as a hot drink in Turkey, the Middle East, and Balkan countries during the wintertime [7,8].
10: Sahlep consumed as a drink is prepared by adding milk to sahlep powder and sugar [9].
11: Sahlep is also used as a stabilizer to produce Kahramanmaras-type ice cream in Turkey [10].
12: In the literature, the protein contents of orchids are mentioned to be in the range of 3.11%4.95% [11]; thus, it is considered as a valuable food source.
13: It has been reported that, depending on the species used, sahlep contains 17.7%54.6% of glucomannan, 5.44%38.7% of starch, and 0.5%1% of nitrogenous substances based on dry material; the proportion of glucomannan was found to be higher than that of the starch of other orchid species.Glucomannans are carbohydrate polymers consisting of 1,4-   -D-mannose and 1,4-   -D-glucose units [12].Glucomannan is soluble fiber which delays gastric emptying time and provides a feeling of fullness, thus playing a role in appetite control.
14: It is used as a natural laxative as it can increase stool volume without damaging the colonic microecology [13,14].
15: Studies show that it regulates intestinal microbiota and reduces the risk of colorectal cancer [14,15].
16: In addition, it ensures the removal of bile acids by feces.
17: This situation can be evaluated as cholesterol excretion.
18: Studies support the claim that glucomannan lowers blood cholesterol level [16].
19: Clinical trials of glucomannans used 3 g/day [17].
20: It is known that supplementary food products containing glucomannan can help control weight and fight the urge to overeat.
21: Thus,  Serapias orchids could be used as a healthy food supplement.
