0: In the literature, there has been limited work related to the volatile constituents (EO, SPME, and n-hexane extract) of some  Serapias species (  Serapias vomeracea (Burm.
1: F.) B.;  Serapias vomeracea subsp.
2: longipetala (Ten.)
3: H. Baumann & Kunkele;  Serapias cordigera L. subsp.
4: cordigera ;  Serapias cordigera subsp.
5: lucana R. Lorenz & V.A.
6: Romano;  Serapias parviflora Parl.
7: ;  Serapias lingua L.;  Serapias lingua L.) [1820].
8: The essential oil of  S. vomeracea has been shown to have dose-dependent antioxidant effects through DPPH assay [18].
9: Some orchid species are known to exhibit antimicrobial and antioxidant biological activity [18,21].
10: However, to the best of our knowledge from the literature survey, no data about chemical compositions and biological activities of  S.orientalis subsp.
11: orientalis (Greuter) H.Baumann & Kunkele have been reported to date.
12: The subject of this study is to investigate the effect of different extraction methods.
13: Therefore, in this paper, we report various volatile constituents of EO, SPME, and SPMEs of  n -hexane, methanol, and water extracts analyzed with GC-FID/MS.Antimicrobial activities of the extracts (  n -hexane, methanol, and water) and EO against 9 microorganisms are evaluated.
14: In addition, porcine pancreatic lipase (PPL) enzyme activity of EO and solvent extracts was investigated.
15: The results of antimicrobial and porcine pancreatic lipase activities of EO and the solvent extracts (  n -hexane, methanol, and water) may be useful in foods, pharmaceuticals, and other industries.
