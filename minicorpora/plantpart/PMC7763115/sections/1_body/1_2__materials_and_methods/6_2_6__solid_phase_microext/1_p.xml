<p>The blended fresh plant (2 g), 
 <italic>n</italic> -hexane (0.0241 g), methanol (0.3802), and water extracts (0.1450) of 
 <italic>Soo</italic> were placed into a sealed SPME vial (10 mL) with a silicone-rubber septum cap, then submitted to a solid-phase microextraction device (Supelco Inc., Bellefonte, PA, USA). A DVB/Carboxen/PDMS coating fiber was used to obtain volatile components. The SPME fibers were conditioned for 5 min at 250 °C in the GC injector. Extraction was achieved with magnetic stirring at 80 °C using an incubation time of 5 min and an extraction time of 10 min. Fibers with extracts of volatile compounds were subsequently injected into the GC injector. GC–FID/MS analysis was performed using a Shimadzu QP2010 Ultra mass selective detector attached to the 2010 Plus chromatograph. The carrier gas used was helium, at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The injection was performed in split mode (1:30) at 230 °C. Samples were analyzed and the results recorded. The temperature, incubation, and extraction times were set according to the reported experiment [22].
