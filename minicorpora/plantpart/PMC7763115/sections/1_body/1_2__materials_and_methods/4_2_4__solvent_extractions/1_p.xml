<p>The fresh plant (120 g) was ground into small pieces using a plant mill. Blended material was weighed (40 g each sample) into 3 different flasks (100 mL) and extracted 3 times with analytical-grade 
 <italic>n</italic> -hexane, methanol, and water solvents (25 mL × 3; 12 h each). After the suction filtration, the same extracts were combined and evaporated at 40 °C to produce crude
