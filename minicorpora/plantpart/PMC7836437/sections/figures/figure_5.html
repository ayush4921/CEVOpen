The MPO dosage was made in homogenized paw tissue after 3 hours of edema induced by intraplantar injection of carrageenan (Cg, 300 µg/paw) or Vehicle (Vh, 0.9% NaCl solution, 50 μL/paw) and normalized by mg of tissue. Data are reported as means±SE (n=6). *P&lt;0.05 vs control, #P&lt;0.05 vs vehicle (one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's test). </caption>
