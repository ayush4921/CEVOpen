 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref> shows the chromatogram for analysis of the EOHc by GC-MS. As can be seen, four main peaks were identified, which correspond to the major constituents camphor (33.62), 1.8-cineole also known as eucalyptol (19.76%), α-pinene (15.24%), and β-caryophyllene (8.00%), followed by 10 smaller peaks. By analyzing the retention time, 100% of the constituents were identified (
