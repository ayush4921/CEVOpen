<p>EOHc significantly inhibited dextran-induced edema (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2A and B</xref>). The inhibitory effect of EOHc extended throughout the experimental time (240 min) for doses ≥ 100 mg/kg. For the doses of 30, 100, and 300 mg/kg of EOHc, the observed inhibition corresponded to 40.28±1.70, 51.18±2.69, and 59.24±2.13%, respectively, of control (105.5±3.45 µL of paw volume variation) edema.
