<p>Data are reported as means±SE. The graph and the statistical analysis were done with the software Sigmaplot
 <sup>®</sup> (version 11.0, Systat Software, USA). Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the means followed by Bonferroni test, a multiple comparison method. For area under curve (AUC) and myeloperoxidase activity graphics, we used one-way ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni test. Results showing a probability of occurrence of the null hypothesis less than 5% (P&lt;0.05) were considered statistically different.
