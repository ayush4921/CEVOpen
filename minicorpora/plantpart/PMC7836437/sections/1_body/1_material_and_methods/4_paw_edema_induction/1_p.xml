<p>Paw edema was induced by intra-plantar subcutaneous injection in the right hind paw of 50 μL of the inflammatory stimuli carrageenan or dextran (both at 1%), histamine (50 nmol/paw), serotonin (1 µg/paw), or bradykinin (3 nmol/paw), 60 min after intragastric administration of EOHc, indomethacin (10 mg/kg), cyproheptadine (5 or 10 mg/kg), or EOHc vehicle (Tween 80, 0.05% v/v). For blockade of carrageenan- or dextran-induced edema, the EOHc was administered at the doses of 10, 30, 100, or 300 mg/kg; for inhibition of response to other inflammatory stimuli histamine (HA), serotonin (5-HT) or bradykinin (BK), the essential oil was used at the dose of 100 and 300 mg/kg, which represents less than 15% of the LD
 <sub>50</sub>. The contralateral paw (control) received, subcutaneously, an equal volume of 0.9% NaCl (the vehicle of dextran or carrageenan). Paw volume variation was measured with a plethysmometer (Panlab, S.L.U., Digital Water Plethysmometer Le 7500, USA) before (zero time), at the 30th and 60th min, and afterwards, every 60 min up to 240 min (for dextran), or up to 300 min (for carrageenan). Edema was considered to be the difference in paw volume measured at different time periods and time zero. In this study, the time course of carrageenan-induced paw edema was considered to have three phases, as in another study (
