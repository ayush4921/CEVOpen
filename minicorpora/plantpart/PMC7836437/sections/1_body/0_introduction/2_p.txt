0: Some biological activities of  H. crenata, such as antimicrobial ( 12), bactericidal, larvicide ( 13), antioxidant ( 5), gastroprotective ( 8), and hepatoprotective ( 14), are already documented.
1: Recent studies from our research group have shown that the essential oil of  Hyptis crenata (EOHc) has low acute toxicity by the oral route ( 10).
2: It demonstrated a hepatoprotective effect in sepsis-induced liver dysfunction at 100 mg/kg ( po) during 14 days ( 14).
3: EOHc has also shown a gastroprotective action ( 8), which was attributed to -pinene, one of its major constituents ( 3).
4: The low acute toxicity of EOHc was demonstrated through the value of its median lethal dose (LD 50) that was estimated to be greater than 2000 mg/kg ( 10).
