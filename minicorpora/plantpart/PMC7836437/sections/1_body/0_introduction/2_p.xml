<p>Some biological activities of 
 <italic>H. crenata</italic>, such as antimicrobial (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), bactericidal, larvicide (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), antioxidant (
 <xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), gastroprotective (
 <xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), and hepatoprotective (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), are already documented. Recent studies from our research group have shown that the essential oil of 
 <italic>Hyptis crenata</italic> (EOHc) has low acute toxicity by the oral route (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). It demonstrated a hepatoprotective effect in sepsis-induced liver dysfunction at 100 mg/kg (
 <italic>po</italic>) during 14 days (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). EOHc has also shown a gastroprotective action (
 <xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), which was attributed to Î±-pinene, one of its major constituents (
 <xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The low acute toxicity of EOHc was demonstrated through the value of its median lethal dose (LD
 <sub>50</sub>) that was estimated to be greater than 2000 mg/kg (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).
