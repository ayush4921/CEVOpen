<p>Previous studies with three species of the genus 
 <italic>Hyptis</italic>, including 
 <italic>H. crenata</italic> show that these plants have common constituents as alpha-pinene, 1,8-cineol, and beta-caryophyllene and point out that these species have important biological activities such as antioxidant and antimicrobial activity (

 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), such as camphor, alpha-pinene, 1.8-cineole, and beta-caryophyllene (

 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Therefore, EOHc, used traditionally for treatment of inflammatory diseases, also has anti-inflammatory activity, as demonstrated here.
