<p>In conclusion, we demonstrated that the EO of 
 <italic>Hyptis crenata</italic>, a plant widely used in folk medicine, had anti-edematogenic activity at very low doses compared to its LD
 <sub>50</sub>, and was likely to be of low toxicity. This EOHc effect, which is interpretable as anti-inflammatory activity due to its inhibitory effects on autacoids and on MPO activity, is consistent with its anti-inflammatory use in folk medicine. The oil showed a potent effect in both edema prevention and reversal of the edema already installed. EOHc efficacy at doses likely to be of low toxicity in humans suggested that this oil has potential for therapeutic use and also that the popular medicinal use of the plant could have a scientific foundation.
