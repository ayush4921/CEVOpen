<p>It was not the purpose of this work to fully investigate the mechanism of action for the anti-inflammatory effect of EOHc. However, based on the effects promoted by EOHc - i) inhibition of dextran-induced edema; ii) inhibition throughout the time course of carrageenan-induced edema; iii) inhibition of edema promoted by the inflammatory mediators histamine, serotonin, and bradykinin; and iv) inhibition of MPO activity - it is very likely that the antiedematogenic effect of EOHc was caused by anti-inflammatory effect. The mechanism of this anti-inflammatory effect is, in part, likely to include the inhibition of increased vascular permeability, which occurs upon release of inflammatory mediators, like histamine, serotonin, cytokines, etc.</p>
