    "The <i>Hyalomma</i> species of ticks have gained additional attention due to their role in the transmission of <i>Theileria annulata</i> infection in animals and the Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) virus in humans. Apart from these, many other pathogens viz., other species of <i>Theileria</i>, a few species of <i>Babesia, Rickettsia</i> and viruses are either maintained or transmitted by this tick species. The medium to large size species with longer proboscis has inflicted additional burden on the overall impact of tick infestations. Being a multi-host species, management of the species is very challenging. Presently, the traditional method of tick management using chemical acaricides is found insufficient and unsustainable. Henceforth, the overall burden of tick infestations and tick-borne diseases are increasing gradually. After the successful development of vaccines against cattle tick, <i>Rhipicephalus microplus</i>, the anti-<i>Hyalomma</i> vaccine is considered a feasible and sustainable management option. In the recent past research on herbal acaricides and its possible application for tick control seems promising. Other eco-friendly methods are still under experimental stage. The present review is focused on impact of <i>Hyalomma</i> species infestation on human and animal health with special emphasis on progress on its sustainable management."
