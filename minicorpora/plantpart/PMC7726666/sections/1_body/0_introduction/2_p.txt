0: Globally, ticks and tick-borne diseases (TTBDs) are the major hurdles to enhance livestock productivity with the threshold being much higher in developing countries.
1: The cumulative global losses incurred for the management of TTBDs are estimated at the tune of US $ 2230 billion per annum ( Minjauw and Mc Leod, 2003;  Lew-Tabor and Rodriguez-Valle, 2016).
2: The direct effect of tick infestations on hosts includes pyemia, toxicosis and paralysis which cause a cumulative projected loss of about US $ 500 million annually ( Minjauw and Mc Leod, 2003;  Chhillar et al., 2014).
3: In addition, production losses due to tick infestations with respect to growth and milk production were estimated as 8.9 ml of milk and 1 g live weight gain per engorging female tick per day, respectively ( Jonsson et al., 2001).
4: Recently, due to climate change and other risk factors, TTBDs have risen insidiously, triggering heightened attention about their impact on human health.
5: In concurrence to this, the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported nearly doubling of TTBDs cases over 13 years ( Rosenberg et al., 2018).
