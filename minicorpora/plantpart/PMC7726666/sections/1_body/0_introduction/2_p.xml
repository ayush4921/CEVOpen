<p id="p0010">Globally, ticks and tick-borne diseases (TTBDs) are the major hurdles to enhance livestock productivity with the threshold being much higher in developing countries. The cumulative global losses incurred for the management of TTBDs are estimated at the tune of US $ 22–30 billion per annum (

Recently, due to climate change and other risk factors, TTBDs have risen insidiously, triggering heightened attention about their impact on human health. In concurrence to this, the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported nearly doubling of TTBDs cases over 13 years (
