<p id="p0160">Literature reveals the acaricide resistant status in 
 <italic>Hyalomma</italic> species is comparatively less in comparison to 
 <italic>R. microplus</italic> and most of the SP and amidine compounds are still working against the species. This is because of the multi-host life cycle of the vector and exposure to different chemicals is comparatively less in comparison to one host tick. However, since co-infestation is the common features in many tropical and sub-tropical countries, the species will definitely develop resistance against a wide range of chemicals in the coming years. A vaccine against 
 <italic>H. anatolicum</italic> can be an effective sustainable measure along with strategic use of natural formulations. Significant lead has been reported but due to severe shortage of funding opportunities in tick vaccine research globally, the work is not progressing in ladder manner. There is an urgent need to increase funding support for research on one health concept in which vaccine against 
 <italic>Hyalomma</italic> spp. forms a focused area of research. The different groups working on tick vaccine globally should come together in a consortium mode to develop suitable immunoprophylactic measures to mitigate the burning problem of ticks and tick-borne diseases.
