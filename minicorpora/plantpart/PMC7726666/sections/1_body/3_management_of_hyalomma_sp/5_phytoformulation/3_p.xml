<p id="p0085">Although there has been a considerable progress in the recent past in natural product development research, most of the findings were restricted to 
 <italic>in-vitro</italic> studies. The effects of geographical and climatic variations on the chemical constituents within the same plant species and identification of activity-based marker compound for quality assurance are the two key important impediments in large scale development of a natural formulation for the management of ticks. In our recent multicentered studies we observed a very wide variation of 10–90% in antitick activity of the same plant extracts prepared from 177 accessions collected from 17 states of India. The variations in antitick activity has recently been attributed to the variation in key compounds present in the extracts (Ghosh unpublished data). One more hurdle is expensive toxicology testing for new products which may have limited intellectual property (IP) protection. Other challenges include the economical supply of plant product, biased perception regarding chemical acaricides vis-à-vis phyto-formulation, quality protection after exposing to sunlight.
