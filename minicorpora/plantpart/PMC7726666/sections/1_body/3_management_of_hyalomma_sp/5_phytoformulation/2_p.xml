<p id="p0080">Literature reveals about 356 species of plants belonging to 105 families have been evaluated against 31 tick species worldwide. In most of the cases 
 <italic>R. microplus</italic> was used as model parasite in in-vitro model and the subject has been reviewed time to time (

 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. As observed in the case of 
 <italic>R. microplus</italic>, a number of solvent guided extracts and essential oils were extracted from aerial parts of different plants and very high level of antitick activity up to 100% was recorded. In general, plant-derived products are having many advantages over the chemical acaricides such as low mammalian toxicity, short environmental persistence and complex chemistry that limit the development of resistance against them (
 <xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">George et al., 2014</xref>). But, along with advantages, plant products are also having drawbacks such as variable efficacy, chemically less-stable and limited residual activity, often due to photosensitivity or high volatility (
