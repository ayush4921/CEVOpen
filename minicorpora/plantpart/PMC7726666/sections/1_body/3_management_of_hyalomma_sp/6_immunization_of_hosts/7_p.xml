<p id="p0115">In an attempt to develop cross-protective vaccine, 
 <xref rid="bib185" ref-type="bibr">Rodriguez-Valle et al. (2012)</xref> immunized cattle and camels with rBm86-based vaccine and challenged with 
 <italic>H. dromedarii</italic> and 
 <italic>A. cajennense</italic> ticks and recorded partial efficacy against former tick and no effect against later tick species. Similarly, cross-protective efficacy of Gavac™ was assessed against 
 <italic>H. anatolicum</italic>, Indian isolate and 25 % efficacy was recorded (
 <xref rid="bib118" ref-type="bibr">Kumar et al., 2012b</xref>). The cross-protective efficacy of rHaa86, SUB, CRT and CathL was also tested against 
 <italic>R. microplus</italic> but the results were not much encouraging and revealed that the species-specific vaccine is more efficacious (
 <xref rid="bib117" ref-type="bibr">Kumar et al., 2017</xref>). Ideally, a cross-protective anti-tick vaccine is an appropriate strategy towards simultaneous control of multi-tick species but for region-specific management of the vector of animal and human pathogens, a vaccine against 
 <italic>H. anatolicum</italic> has a distinct position in tropical and sub-tropical countries including India.
