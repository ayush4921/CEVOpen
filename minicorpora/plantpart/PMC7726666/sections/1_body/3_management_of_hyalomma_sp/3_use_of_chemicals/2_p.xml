<p id="p0065">Out of the existing tick management platforms, use of chemical acaricides form the backbone of the programme due to easy availability and application. The commonly available acaricides are organophosphates (OP) (chlorfenvinphos, chlorpyrifos, coumaphos and diazinon), synthetic pyrethroids (SP) (cypermethrin, deltamethrin, flumethrin, permethrin), amidines (amitraz) and phenylpyrazole (fipronil) etc. After the introduction of injectable/parenteral endectocides, macrocyclic lactones (ML), avermectin (Ivermectin, Doramectin) and milbemycin (Moxidectin) compounds, the use of MLs is increased significantly for the management of endo and ectoparasites. Consequent to the indiscriminate usage of acaricides, resistant tick populations have been developed and established (
