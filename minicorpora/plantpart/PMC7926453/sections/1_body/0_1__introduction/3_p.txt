0: In addition to the health hazards of manufactured fungicides, the development of pathogen resistance is another problem.
1: The fungicides of biological origin, such as essential oils, representing a promising alternative approach not only for controlling postharvest decay but also for delaying the natural deterioration of stored fruits [ 13].
2: In general, such oils could be used as natural additives to extend shelf-life during the preservation of stored fruits.
3: The levels of essential oils and their ingredients are determent factors in this respect [ 14].
4: Furthermore, essential oils represent ecofriendly, biodegradable, multifunctional, and nonpersistent natural products that reduce the risk of pathogen resistance build-up against chemicals because they contain two or more stereoisomers that target multi-sites on the pathogens cell membrane [ 9].
