<p>Fruits and vegetables are consumed fresh. Improper postharvest handling causes rapid deteriorations in the quality of fresh produce and, in some cases, this results in products not reaching consumers at a satisfactory quality. The main cause of fruit deterioration is dehydration, with subsequent weight loss, color changes, softening, surface pitting, browning, loss of acidity, and microbial spoilage [

 <italic>Penicillium</italic> (green mold), 
 <italic>Botrytis, Monilia</italic>, and others, leading to color changes and softening, accompanied by various economic losses that are dependent on the fruit type and storage conditions [

 <italic>Penicillium</italic> spp. may expose the health of the ultimate consumers to possible risk, since the fungus is usually linked to the production of mycotoxins, e.g., patulin; harmful metabolites which are detrimental to human health [
