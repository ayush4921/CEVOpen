0: Jerusalem artichoke ( Helianthus tuberosus L. family:  Asteraceae) is a tuber-producing plant.
1: In addition to being used as livestock fodder and in the production of biofuels, its tubers are consumed in human food and some functional-food ingredients because of their high nutritive value and polysaccharides contents, such as inulin, and oligofructose [ 6, 7].
2: Under storage conditions, several fungi associated with rotted JA tubers have been reported, which vary in their disease potentiality and economic significance, e.g.,  Sclerotium rolfsii,  Sclerotinia sclerotiorum [ 8, 9, 10],  Botrytis cinerea,  Rhizopus stolonifera,  Penicillium, and  Fusarium species [ 11], and  Rhizoctonia solani [ 12].
