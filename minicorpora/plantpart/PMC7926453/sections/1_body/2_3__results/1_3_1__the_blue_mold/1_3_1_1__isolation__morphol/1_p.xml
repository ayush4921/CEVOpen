<p>The decayed JA tubers stored under cooling conditions and with the typical symptoms of blue mold were selected. They were mostly specified as belonging to 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> spp. The Penicillium isolates (ARS20, ARS21, and ARS22) were subjected to further characterization. The initial morphological investigation on PDA, CDA, and MEA media at 25 ± 2 °C after 7 days showed blue–green, velutinous on MEA. Colonies for the three isolates have a distinct reverse, often with a yellow–brown color (

The mean colony diameters (mm) for ARS20, ARS21 and ARS22 were 28.9 ± 0.96, 27.6 ± 0.50 and 29.8 ± 0.65 (on PDA), 31.56 ± 0.53, 30.6 ± 0.75, and 30.97 ± 0.6 (on MEA) and 28.56 ± 0.53, 29.21 ± 0.42, and 30.10 ± 0.4 (on CDA), respectively. The microscopic examination of the colonies revealed two-stage branched conidiophores, adpressed phialides with rough-walled stipes, and conidia that were smooth, globose to sub-globose, and borne in columns. Conidial dimensions for ARS20 were 3.0–3.6 (3.15) × 2.6–3.4 (2.9) μm, for ARS21 were 2.85–3.35 (3.1) × 2.57–3.55 (3.0) and for ARS22 were 2.95–3.8 (3.32) × 2.7–3.65 (3.16) μm in diameter (
