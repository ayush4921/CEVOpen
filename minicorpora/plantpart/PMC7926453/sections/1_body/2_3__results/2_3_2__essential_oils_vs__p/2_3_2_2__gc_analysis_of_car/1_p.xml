<p>After extraction, the composition of the most two effective oils was chemically screened using GC (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00413-f008">Figure 8</xref>). The major components in clove and caraway oils were eugenol and carvone, respectively. Caraway oil is mainly constituted of monoterpenes, while the main component in clove oil, i.e., eugenol, is a phenylpropanoid. However, eight compounds were identified in clove essential oil, i.e., methyl salicylate, bicyclobutylidiene, eugenol, eugenyl acetate, and farnesene, in addition to three unidentified compounds. The major compounds were eugenol (49.077%), methyl salicylate (19.274%), and eugenyl acetate (11.551%). Of the seven compounds separated in caraway oil, four were identified, which are carvone (60.398%), limonene (35.265%), perilla alcohol (1.430%), and carveol (1.106%).
