<p>The comparative response of 
 <italic>P. polonicum</italic> growth in response to four tested oils was screened. The results of fungal growth percent in relation to the control (100%) show (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00413-f007">Figure 7</xref>) a large variation in 
 <italic>P. polonicum</italic> growth due to the kind of oil tested. Two diverse patterns could be noticed, mint and artemisia oils induced fungal growth up to 2% of the oil. Then, opposite to artemisia oil that slightly reduced growth at 3 and 4%, mint oil continued inducing the growth (&gt;100%) at higher concentrations (4%). From point of view of effectiveness and economics, both oils were omitted from the subsequent trials. Another pattern was shown by the other two oils, which exerted a declining pattern of fungal growth. Both caraway and clove oils vigorously reduced growth at 1%, followed by full inhibition at the higher concentrations (2% and above). The latter two oils were further explored in relation to the biocatalytic activity of the fungus.
