<p>The comparative response of defense-related phytochemicals (peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase, and total phenols) of the stored JA tubers to CR or CL essential oils were measured over 4 months (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00413-f010">Figure 10</xref>), in the presence or absence of 
 <italic>P. polonicum</italic>. The obtained results indicate that JA tubers infected with 
 <italic>P. polonicum</italic> showed a significant increase in total phenol levels and the activity of both enzymes, as compared to those of the untreated control and healthy JA tubers treated with either of the essential oils. On the contrary, under infection stress, treatment with the CR essential oil led to the highest increase in both enzymes, and phenol content. JA treated with Cl oil came next, ranking second when compared with untreated-infected tubers.
