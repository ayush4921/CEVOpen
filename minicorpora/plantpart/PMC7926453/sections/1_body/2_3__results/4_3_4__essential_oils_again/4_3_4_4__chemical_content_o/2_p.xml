<p>A similar negative relationship, with a slow degradation, was detected between the untreated-control (C) and the progress of the storage period up to 4 months. Treatment of the uninfected tubers with CR and CL oils significantly reduced the degradation of their inulin, protein, and increase carbohydrate contents compared with the untreated-control, over 4 months of storage. Under infection stress, JA tubers treated with CR or CR oils effectively lowered the reduction in carbohydrate, inulin, and protein degradation compared with the untreated-infected control over the storage period.</p>
