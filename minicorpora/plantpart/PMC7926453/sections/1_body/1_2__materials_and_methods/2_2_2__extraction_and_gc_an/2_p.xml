<p>Based on the antifungal screening test, caraway and clove oils—the most effective against the growth of the fungal pathogen—were analyzed by a Gas Chromatography-Flame Ionization Detector (FID), using a DsChrom 6200 gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector and a column of BPX-5, 5% phenyl (Equiv.) polysillphenylene-siloxane 30 m × 0.25 mm ID × 0.25µm film with a sample size of 1 μL. The temperature program ramp was increased at a rate of 10 °C per min from 70 to 200 °C. The detector temperature, FID, was 280 °C. The carrier gas was at a flow rate of (mL/min) 30 (N
 <sub>2</sub>):30 (H
 <sub>2</sub>):300 (air). The main compounds of the essential oils were identified by matching their retention times with those of the standard authentic samples injected under the same conditions. The relative percentage of every compound was calculated from the area of the peak corresponding to each compound.
