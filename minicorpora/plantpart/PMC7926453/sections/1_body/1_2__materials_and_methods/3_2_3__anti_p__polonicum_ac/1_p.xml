<p>For the in-vitro assessment of the activity of the essential oils against 
 <italic>P. polonicum</italic>, initially, each of the four essential oils was screened and evaluated. Erlenmeyer flasks (250 mL), containing 50 mL sterilized potato dextrose (PD) broth medium and 0.5% Tween-20 were prepared. After sterilization, each essential oil was separately added to flasks to cover a range of concentrations from 1 to 4% (

Flasks were inoculated using 1 mL of spore suspension (prepared from 5-days old culture grown on plates of PD agar at 28 ± 2 °C for 5 days and suspended in sterile saline (0.85%) to adjust the count to 106 spores/mL). Then, the flasks were incubated in the dark at 28 ± 2 °C for 7 days. An untreated medium was used as a control. Triplicate flasks were used for each treatment. At the end of the incubation period, the mycelial mats were harvested, washed several times with distilled water, and oven-dried to a constant weight at 70 °C. The biological activity of oils was expressed as the growth percentage in the mycelial dry weight, in relation to the control (0% oil).
