<p>To explore the enzymatic profile of 
 <italic>P. polonicum</italic> in the presence of the most effective oils (caraway and clove), another fermentation trial was performed. The fermentation procedure and the medium of [
 <xref rid="B19-plants-10-00413" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] were used with some modifications. Erlenmeyer flasks containing 50 mL of the medium were supplemented with one gram of ground cold-dried powder of 
 <italic>H. tuberosus</italic> tubers. After sterilization, the medium was further supplemented with both oils at concentrations of 0.5–2.5%. Then, the medium was inoculated with 1 mL of the previously-prepared spore suspension. The batch fermentation was carried out in the dark under shaking conditions (200 rpm) at 28 ± 2 °C for 7 days. After incubation, the mycelium was removed by centrifugation (5000 rpm for 20 min) and the culture filtrate was assayed for hydrolytic enzymes.
