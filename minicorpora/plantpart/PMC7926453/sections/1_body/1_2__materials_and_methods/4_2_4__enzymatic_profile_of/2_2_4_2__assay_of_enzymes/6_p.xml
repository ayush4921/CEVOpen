<p>The proteolytic activity (protease) was quantitatively assayed in a reaction mixture of crude extract and casein as a substrate. After incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, free amino acids were separated by trichloroacetic acid [
 <xref rid="B25-plants-10-00413" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], the released amino acids were measured at A280. One U of protease activity was defined as the amount of the enzyme resulting in the release of 1 µg of tyrosine equivalent/mL/min under the assay conditions.
