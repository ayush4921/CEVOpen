For the determination of morphological structures, portions of fungal growth were mounted in lactophenol cotton blue stain on clean slides. The prepared slides were examined under a light microscope using the 40× and 100× objectives for identification of vegetative mycelium; septation, diameters, conidiophores, and the reproductive structures.
