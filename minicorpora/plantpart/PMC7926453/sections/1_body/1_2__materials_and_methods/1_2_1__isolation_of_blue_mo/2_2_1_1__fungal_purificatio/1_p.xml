<p>Samples that showed the typical characteristics and symptoms of blue mold were selected, on which, three isolates (ARS20, ARS21, and ARS22) were detected. The emerged fungal growth was picked and purified using the hyphal tip and/or single spore techniques, before being transferred to plates containing PDA in the presence of the same antibiotic (0.1 mg/L L-chloramphenicol and 0.3 mg/l streptomycin sulfate). For studying the morphological features of the isolates, a two-point inoculation on the media of PDA, Czapek dox agar (CDA), and malt extract agar (MEA), using a dense conidial suspension was conducted, and then this was incubated at 25 ± 2 °C for 7 days. Pure cultures of developing fungi were transferred to slants containing potato carrot agar medium and kept at 4 °C for further studies. The occurrence percentage for each of the three isolates in the different samples was recorded.</p>
