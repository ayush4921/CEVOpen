<p>The severity (%) of the tuber rot was evaluated based on a scale from 0 to 9, with some modification; where: (0) no symptoms of rot, (1) up to 10% of tuber rot, (2) more than 10 up to 20% of tuber rot, (3) more than 20 up to 30% of tuber rot, (4) more than 30 up to 40% of tuber rot, (5) more than 40 up to 50% of tuber rot, (6) more than 50 up to 60% of tuber rot, (7) more than 60 up to 70% of tuber rot, (8) more than 70 up to 80% of tuber rot, and (9) more than 80% of tuber rot [
 <xref rid="B9-plants-10-00413" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The severity% (
 <italic>S</italic>) was then calculated using the following formula:
