<p>The selected 
 <italic>P. polonicum</italic> ARS20 isolate was identified molecularly, by applying the molecular biological procedure of DNA isolation and amplification via the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). DNA isolation and purification were performed using DNeasy Tissue Kits (QIAGEN-Germany), followed by determination of DNA concentration through comparing with standard lambda DNA on 1% (
