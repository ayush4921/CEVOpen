<p>A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the ITS region sequence comparisons of length polymorphism of the amplified PCR, and sequences from the database using blast tree and aligned using aligned sequences nucleotide BLAST. The phylogeny was tested using the bootstrap method with 2000 replications and generated based on the UPGMA statistical method. The software package; MEGA 10 was used for multiple alignments and phylogenetic analysis based on the neighbor-joining method. The obtained sequence (688 bp) was deposited in GenBank to obtain the closely related fungi sequences; then, the accession number of the fungal strain was received.</p>
