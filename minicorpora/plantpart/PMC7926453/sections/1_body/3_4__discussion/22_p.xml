<p>During the current trial, peat moss was used which is traditionally used in food preservation because of its antimicrobial activity. This antimicrobial activity is possibly attributable to some of its bioactive components, such as sphagnan, a pectin-like polymer that inhibits microbial growth via electrostatic immobilization of extracellular enzymes and/or nitrogen deprivation, in addition to phenolics that inhibit the activity of extracellular enzymes of microbes, or other constituents such as sterols and polyacetylenes [

However, dry matter content in JA tubers depends on many factors, such as storage conditions [
