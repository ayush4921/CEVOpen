<p>Regarding the pathogenicity test, the three isolates of 
 <italic>P. polonicum</italic> exhibited various degrees of disease severity. Isolates recovered from the artificially inoculated tubers showed the same morphological characteristics as those that previously appeared in the case of natural infection under storage that comes in agreement with Kochâ€™s postulates. To our knowledge, this is the first report of 
 <italic>P. polonicum</italic> on stored JA tubers. Previously, 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> spp. were reported as the most form of common storage rot pathogen, but specific species were not previously identified [

 <italic>P. polonicum</italic> has previously been reported as a psychro-tolerant xerophilic fungus that is associated with the spoilage of many foods and food products, such as peanuts, cereals, yam tubers, kiwifruit fruits, onions, and green table olives [
