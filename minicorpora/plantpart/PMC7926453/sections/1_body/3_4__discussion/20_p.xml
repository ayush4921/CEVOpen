<p>The structural features of JA tubers under storage showed marked variations. The presence of the pathogen caused a pronounced reduction in the dry matter in the infected control, accompanied by a gradual increment in sprouting, as well as weight loss. This principally suggests a loss of a certain quantity of water from the tuber. Moreover, during long-term exposure to storage conditions (without EOs application), shrinking and water losses were recorded in tubers.</p>
