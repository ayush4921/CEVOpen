<p>Interestingly, FPase, xylanase, and PGase were found in the filtrate of the pathogen, despite the composition of JA tubers lacking cellulose and xylan in their structure. The main reason explaining such data is based on the secretion nature of enzymes by the microorganism, which is either induced, constitutive, or both. The induced (inducible) enzyme is one whose secretion requires—or is stimulated by—a specific inducer (substrate). Whereas, the constitutive enzyme is on that is produced by a microorganism, regardless of the presence or absence of the specific substrate [
