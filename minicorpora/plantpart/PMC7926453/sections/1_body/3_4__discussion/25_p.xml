<p>Carbohydrates, inulin, and protein contents varied during storage according to the treatments, both oils minimized the development of the deterioration process. A fresh JA tuber contains up to 80% water, 10.6–17.3% carbohydrates—mainly in the form of inulin (7–30%)—and about 2–8% protein [

For the long-term storage of JA tubers, there are various microbiological, enzymatic, and biochemical alterations, which may lead to tuber damage in carbohydrate and protein chemistry. However, the basic constituents of caraway oil (monoterpenes) tend to delay the breakdown of tuber components associated with the enzymatic system, as well as respiration and energy metabolic enzymes, maintaining the internal biochemical enzymatic activities at a minimum level [
