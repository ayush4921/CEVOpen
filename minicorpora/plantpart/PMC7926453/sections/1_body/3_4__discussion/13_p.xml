<p>Inulinases and invertase act as β-fructosidases. Inulinases hydrolyze inulin to liberate fructose units in a single step from the non-reducing end, by the action of two main enzymes (endoinulinase—which is specific for inulin—and exoinulinase [

Invertases (β-fructofuranosidases) are a large group of glycoside hydrolases, which catalyze the hydrolysis of sucrose to an equimolar mixture of glucose and fructose—both inulinases. Invertase enzymes are active on sucrose and, more, possess the unique feature of being able to hydrolyze inulin [
