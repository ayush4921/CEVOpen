<p>The GC analysis revealed various components of the clove and caraway essential oils, with fractions showing evident antifungal capacity, which varied according to the distribution of the components of each fraction. The GC analysis showed an increase in the proportion of oxygenated compounds in caraway fractions in comparison to hydrocarbons, therefore, caraway oil could be considered to be highly oxygenated while clove oil is moderately oxygenated. Previously, oxygenated compounds have been reported to have bioactive inhibitory effects against several fungal strains, including numerous 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> strains, such activity of the oil could be attributed to the oxygenated carvone that possessed higher antifungal activity, as well as antioxidant activity [

Furthermore, the physical nature of the rich oxygenated essential oils, for example, their low molecular weight combined with a lipophilic character, allow them to penetrate the cell membrane more quickly compared to other substances [
