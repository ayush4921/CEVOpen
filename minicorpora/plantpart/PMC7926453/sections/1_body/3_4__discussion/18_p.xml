<p>The current pathogenic 
 <italic>P. polonicum</italic> has a complementary profile of hydrolytic enzymes, which is why 
 <italic>P. polonicum</italic> causes a serious mold and completely deteriorates JA tubers under storage. Fortunately, this tight enzymatic capacity disappeared after the application of oils, with both oils showing a strong inhibition impact on both growth and enzymatic production systems. The enzymatic deactivation of essential oils is a mutual interaction between the microorganism, oil components, and concentration, for example, the eugenol content of clove oil as well as, the presence of an aromatic nucleus and phenolic OH-group can react with the target enzyme, resulting in the deactivation of enzymes, and alteration of the cell membrane [
