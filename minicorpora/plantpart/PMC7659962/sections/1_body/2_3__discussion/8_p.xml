<p>The validation of our cell system provides us with confidence that these cells are reliable tools to study rTRPA1, hTRPV1, and hTRPV4 functional activation, and our stably transfected cells consistently responded to TRP agonists, AITC (TRPA1), capsaicin (TRPV1), and GSK-1019670A (TRPV4). However, β-myrcene failed to activate hTRPV1 in our study, contradicting a previous report [

There are numerous differences in assay conditions that may help explain the discrepant findings, including differences in expression levels of TRPV1, which may render other systems more sensitive to the effects of terpenoids, such as β-myrcene. Differences in the methods utilized to measure changes in [Ca
