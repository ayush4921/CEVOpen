<p>In conclusion, we report that essential oils isolated from the leaves and flowers of 
 <italic>M. fistulosa</italic> are TRPA1 agonists. Moreover, we found that the 
 <italic>Monarda</italic> essential oil constituents thymol, carvacrol, and Î²-myrcene were the primary mediators of TRPA1 channel activation. In support of these results, molecular modeling studies showed that these active molecules had similar poses within the binding site of human TRPA1. The interaction of these essential oils and constituents with TRPA1 channels provides a molecular basis to partially explain the therapeutic effects of 
 <italic>M. fistulosa</italic> essential oils. We expect that future in vivo studies investigating the modulation/regulation of these TRP channels will enhance our understanding of the physiological effects of essential oils extracted from 
 <italic>M. fistulosa</italic>.
