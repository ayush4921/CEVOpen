<p>Carvacrol, thymol, and Î²-myrcene activated TRPA1 channels in the micromolar range, with selectivity for TRPA1 versus TRPV1 and TRPV4, implying that their pungent properties are mainly, if not exclusively, due to TRPA1 channel stimulation. Additionally, there have been a few reports implicating the involvement of other TRP channels as molecular targets for these monoterpenes. For example, Xu et al. suggested TRPV3 as a molecular target for skin sensitization by plant derivatives (carvacrol and thymol) isolated from oregano, thyme, savory, and clove [
