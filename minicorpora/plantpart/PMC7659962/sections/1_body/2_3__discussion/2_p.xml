<p>A total of 45 compounds was isolated from both MEO
 <sub>Fl</sub> and MEO
 <sub>Lv</sub>, with carvacrol, 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene, γ-terpinene, α-terpinene, thymol, and β-myrcene being the major constituents, along with 16 other compounds present in trace amounts (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04873-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). As Mazza and Marshall indicated, the chemical composition of 
 <italic>M. fistulosa</italic> essential oils is dependent on genotype and geographic origin [
 <xref rid="B64-molecules-25-04873" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Indeed, our results were comparable to the composition of 
 <italic>M. fistulosa</italic> essential oils obtained from the Szczecin region in Poland, which had carvacrol, 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene, α-terpinene, and γ-terpinene as the major constituents [
 <xref rid="B62-molecules-25-04873" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] and were distinct from the high thymol content (60.8%) in 
 <italic>M. fistulosa</italic> essential oils reported by Lawrence [
 <xref rid="B65-molecules-25-04873" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>].
