<p>Three-dimensional conformers of carvacrol, thymol, β-myrcene, and 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene were downloaded from the PubChem database (compound ID numbers 10364, 6989, 31253, and 7463, respectively) and imported into MVD. Docking was performed with a rigid receptor and flexible ligands. For each compound, 300 docking runs were performed. For the docking poses obtained, additional geometry optimizations were carried out using the “Energy Minimization” and “Optimize HBonds” options of the MVD program.
