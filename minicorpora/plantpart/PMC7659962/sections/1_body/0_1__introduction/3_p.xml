<p>Members of the calcium-permeable transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channel family respond to a wide variety of odorant phytochemicals. For example, TRPA1 is activated by mustard oil or allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) from the mustard plant [

 <xref rid="B32-molecules-25-04873" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], and TRPV1 is activated by capsaicin from chili peppers [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-25-04873" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Essential oil constituents, primarily monoterpenes, have been reported to exert beneficial physiological effects. For example, TRP channels of the vanilloid (TRPV) and melastatin (TRPM) subfamily have been reported to enhance the re-epithelialization of cutaneous wounds in the presence of Î²-caryophyllene [

 <xref rid="B36-molecules-25-04873" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] via potential interaction with TRPA1, TRPV1, and TRPM8. Finally, carvacrol, a monoterpene found in oregano, has been shown to be a potent vasodilator through activation of TRPV3 channels in rat smooth muscle cells [
