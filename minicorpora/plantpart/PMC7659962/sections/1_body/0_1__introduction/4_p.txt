0: TRPA1, the single ion channel in the ankyrin subfamily, is emerging as a significant target for several phytochemicals and related compounds with novel analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties [ 38].
1: Based on the reported anti-inflammatory properties of  M. fistulosa extracts and the likely high monoterpene composition of essential oils from this plant, we hypothesized that TRPA1 might be one of its potential therapeutic targets because monoterpenes are known to target TRPA1.
2: Thus, we evaluated these essential oils and their major constituents, including carvacrol, thymol, -myrcene, -terpinene, -terpinene, and  p-cymene, for their ability to activate intracellular Ca 2+ flux in HEK293 cells expressing TRPV1, TRPV4, or TRPA1.
3: We found that  Monarda essential oils activated TRPA1 ion channels but had no effect on TRPV1 or TRPV4 channels.
4: Furthermore, TRPA1 agonist effects were primarily attributed to the monoterpene constituents (carvacrol, thymol, and -myrcene).
