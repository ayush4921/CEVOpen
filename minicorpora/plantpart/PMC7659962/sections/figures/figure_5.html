 <caption> Monarda constituents carvacrol, thymol, and myrcene induce [Ca 2+] i increases in HEK rTRPA1 cells. Representative traces demonstrating the dose-dependent effects of carvacrol ( A), thymol ( B), and β-myrcene ( C) (arrows #1–5 representing 50, 75, 100, 125, and 150 µM of each compound) on [Ca 2+] i in HEK rTRPA1 cells. Summarized data for the dose-dependent increases in [Ca 2+] i are shown in ( D). The data are presented as the mean ± SEM ( n = 90 cells) from 3 independent experiments. </caption>
