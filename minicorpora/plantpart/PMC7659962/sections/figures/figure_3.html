 <caption> Monarda essential oil-induced increases in [Ca 2+] i are independent of TRPV1 and TRPV4 channels. Representative traces demonstrating the unaltered [Ca 2+] i baseline in HEK hTRPV1 ( A) and HEK hTRPV4 ( B) in the presence of MEO Fl (arrow #2) and MEO Lv (#3) (25 µg/mL). The TRPV1 agonist capsaicin (100 nM, #1) and the TRPV4 agonist GSK-1016790A (10 µM, #4) were used to confirm the expression of functional TRPV1 and TRPV4 channels in HEK cells. Summarized data are shown in ( C) and ( D), respectively. The data are expressed as the change in [Ca 2+] i influx from baseline to peak [Ca 2+] i and plotted as the mean ± SEM. * p &lt; 0.0001 compared to the agonist-induced [Ca 2+] i influx. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance; n = 90 cells from 3 independent experiments. </caption>
