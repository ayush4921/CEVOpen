  <p>Monoterpenes do not induce increases in [Ca

   <sub>i</sub> in HEK cells expressing TRPV1 and TRPV4 channels. Representative traces demonstrating the unaltered [Ca

   <sub>i</sub> baseline in HEK hTRPV1 (
   <bold>A</bold>) and HEK hTRPV4 (
   <bold>B</bold>) in the presence of 100 µM of carvacrol (#2), thymol (#3), β-myrcene (#4), α-terpinene (#5), and γ-terpinene (#6). Capsaicin (#1), the MTRPV1 agonist, and GSK-1016790A (#7), the TRPV4 agonist, were used to confirm the expressions of the TRPV1 and TRPV4 channels, respectively. Summarized data are shown in (
   <bold>C</bold>) and (
   <bold>D</bold>) for TRPV1 and TRPV4 HEK cells, respectively. The data are expressed as change in the [Ca

   <sub>i</sub> influx from baseline to peak [Ca
   <sup>2+</sup>]
   <sub>i</sub> and plotted as mean ± SEM. * 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001 compared to agonist-induced [Ca
