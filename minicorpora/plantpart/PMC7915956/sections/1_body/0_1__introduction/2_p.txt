0: To overcome these limitations associated with the use of proteins as techno-functional food ingredients, several modification approaches exist.
1: These include chemical, physical, or enzymatic modification of the proteins structure, as well as the addition of further synergistically acting ingredients [ 8].
2: Among these approaches, chemical and enzymatic methods have been shown to be very effective at improving the solubility, emulsifying, foaming, and gelling properties of food proteins [ 9, 10, 11].
3: However, most chemical approaches require the excessive use of toxic reagents and might produce harmful byproducts [ 12].
4: This greatly reduces the applicability of these approaches for the food industry.
5: Thus, one of the most promising methods to improve the techno-functional properties of proteins is their glycation with carbohydrates under the influence of heat via the first step of the Maillard reaction.
6: The Maillard reaction, as first described by Louis-Camille Maillard [ 13], involves a series of non-enzymatic reactions between the free amino groups of a protein and the carbonyl functions of a reducing carbohydrates.
7: Since the Maillard reaction is a natural and spontaneously occurring process in food that does not require additional chemicals, it is superior to other chemical modification methods.
