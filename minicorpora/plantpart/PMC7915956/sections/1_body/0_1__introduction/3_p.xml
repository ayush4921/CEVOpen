<p>Over the past three decades, research has shown that glycation with carbohydrates via the Maillard reaction under the influence of heat can improve many of the techno-functional properties of food proteins [

However, with climate change as the defining issue of our time, and faced with pressure to transition toward more environmentally sustainable practices, the food industry aims to substitute animal-based foodstuffs with plant-based ones. This has sparked interest in studying the influence of glycation on the properties of plant-derived proteins. Numerous studies on proteins from various sources have been conducted over the past 10 years. This review aims to give an introduction to the most relevant plant proteins and the challenges associated with their use as techno-functional ingredients, the underlying mechanism of food protein modification by glycation, and manufacturing techniques for glycated proteins, as well as an overview of the current state of studies dealing with the controlled glycation of plant proteins via the Maillard reaction and their potential fields of application in the food industry.
