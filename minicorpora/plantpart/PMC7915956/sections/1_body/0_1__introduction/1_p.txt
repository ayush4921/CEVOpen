0: A rising consumer demand for more natural and sustainable products has caused the food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical sectors to increasingly develop and use plant-based ingredients to replace animal-based ones.
1: This trend toward the use of sustainable and natural ingredients with clean labels is especially pronounced in food and beverage formulations and has led to the creation of a global market that is expected to be worth USD 47.5 billion by 2023 [ 1].
2: Besides their nutritional value, proteins are generally regarded as natural ingredients with valuable technological functionalities that can improve the texture and stability of many foods [ 2].
3: However, despite the current consumer demand for plant-based foods, a significant number of plant proteins are still underutilized in food preparations because their poor techno-functional properties limit their applicability and effectiveness in formulations [ 3].
4: Another common problem is the high allergenicity of many plant proteins, such as the ones derived from soy, wheat, and nuts [ 4], and the fact that many plant proteins contain antinutritional factors, such as several types of proteinase inhibitors that can hinder human digestion [ 5, 6].
5: Moreover, the use of proteins as ingredients is generally hindered by their susceptibility to structural changes during processing steps (e.g., temperature/pressure treatment, change of pH/ionic strength), which can affect their techno-functionality [ 7].
