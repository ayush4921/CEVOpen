<p>To overcome these limitations associated with the use of proteins as techno-functional food ingredients, several modification approaches exist. These include chemical, physical, or enzymatic modification of the proteinâ€™s structure, as well as the addition of further synergistically acting ingredients [

Thus, one of the most promising methods to improve the techno-functional properties of proteins is their glycation with carbohydrates under the influence of heat via the first step of the Maillard reaction. The Maillard reaction, as first described by Louis-Camille Maillard [
 <xref rid="B13-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], involves a series of non-enzymatic reactions between the free amino groups of a protein and the carbonyl functions of a reducing carbohydrates. Since the Maillard reaction is a natural and spontaneously occurring process in food that does not require additional chemicals, it is superior to other chemical modification methods.
