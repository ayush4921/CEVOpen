<p>Although the structureâ€“function relationship of glycated plant proteins has not yet fully been clarified, numerous studies highlight their superior performance as emulsifiers, foam stabilizers, film-forming biopolymers, and encapsulation agents compared to their non-glycated forms. With a deeper understanding of the connection between molecular structure and techno-functional performance, these proteins can play a major role in developing innovative food products with tailor-made functional properties. To further evaluate the potential of glycated plant protein ingredients, sensory analysis can help to understand the effects of glycation on the flavor of the protein and ensure that these ingredients do not contain compounds formed in the advanced stages of the Maillard reaction that could negatively affect sensory properties and have negative safety aspects. If necessary, the degree of glycation must be adjusted to also meet sensory and safety requirements.</p>
