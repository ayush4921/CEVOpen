<p>The controlled glycation of plant proteins via the first stage of the Maillard reaction and the resulting beneficial techno-functional effects have been reviewed. The reaction mechanism and the typical indicators for each of the three stages of the Maillard reaction and influencing factors were shown, along with recent studies demonstrating the benefits of plant protein glycation for application in the food industry. In the future, the demand for proteins with high nutritional value and techno-functionality will increase in line with the growing world population. New protein sources and the extraction of plant proteins as side-stream outputs from byproducts of existing manufacturing processes will become increasingly important. Clearly, there is a growing interest in glycation as a way to overcome the deficits of these plant-protein preparations, such as low solubility, off-tastes, and off-flavors.</p>
