<p>Glycation of proteins indirectly improves their emulsifying properties by enhancing their solubility and mobility and providing added stability against extrinsic influences in aqueous solutions such as pH shifts or addition of salts [

 <xref rid="B259-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">259</xref>]. In addition to electrostatic repulsion, emulsions formulated with glycated proteins also provide steric repulsion due to the added carbohydrate moiety. Upon adsorption, the carbohydrate part of the molecule is anchored at the interface between oil and water by the amphiphilic protein part and is exposed to the aqueous phase due to its hydrophilicity, where it physically hinders van der Waals attraction between oil droplets, especially at pH values close to the isoelectric point where electrostatic repulsion is low [

 <xref rid="B260-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">260</xref>]. The thicker the interfacial layer, the better the resistance of oil droplets to aggregation and coalescence during storage and under the influence of mechanical stress and high shear forces (e.g., during unit operations such as mixing and pumping) [

 <xref rid="B226-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">226</xref>] demonstrated that deamidated wheat protein glycated with dextran forms thicker interfacial layers than adsorbed protein alone. The conjugated wheat protein provided enhanced steric stabilization of emulsions under acidic pH conditions. Zhang et al. [
 <xref rid="B148-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>] showed that emulsions stabilized by soy protein isolateâ€“maltodextrin conjugates exhibited high storage stability after two months at room temperature, especially at pH values around the isoelectric point of the protein, compared to emulsions stabilized with soy protein isolate only. In their study on canola protein isolate glycated with gum, Pirestani et al. [
 <xref rid="B244-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">244</xref>] showed that conjugate-stabilized emulsions had smaller mean droplet sizes and lower creaming indices compared to emulsions stabilized by canola protein isolate or a mixture of the two polymers.
