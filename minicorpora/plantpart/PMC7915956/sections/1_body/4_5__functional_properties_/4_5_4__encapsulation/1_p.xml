<p>Most bioactive compounds are very sensitive to high temperatures, high salt concentrations, extreme pH values, and the presence of oxygen. In addition, many of them are restricted in their applicability by their limited water or oil solubility. To overcome these limitations, encapsulation systems in which bioactive compounds are entrapped by biomacromolecules in the form of emulsions, films, gels, or beads were developed [
