<p>The improved stability of encapsulation systems with glycated plant proteins against external influences such as thermal treatments, extreme pH, and ionic salts are also useful in the encapsulation of bioactive compounds susceptible to gastric digestion. An example is the encapsulation of the essential oil citral. Due to its chemical instability and tendency to undergo changes during processing, storage, and gastric digestion, its application as antimicrobial agent is limited [

The improvement of emulsion stability, and hence the controlled release of citral, was ascribed to the protection of soy protein against pancreatin digestion and the steric stabilization of emulsion droplets, both being a consequence of the glycation of soy protein isolate [

The glycated proteins were used as emulsifier and wall material for the encapsulation of tomato oleoresin, a lycopene-rich material, by spray-drying. These particles could protect the lycopene from being released in the stomach and degrading during storage [
