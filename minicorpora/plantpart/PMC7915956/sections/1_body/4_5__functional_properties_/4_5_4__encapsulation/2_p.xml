<p>Since glycated plant proteins show high solubility, excellent emulsification activity, and stability (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec5dot1-foods-10-00376">Section 5.1</xref>), as well as antioxidant properties, their use in the encapsulation of bioactive materials has attracted interest. Simultaneous increases in emulsifying properties and antioxidant activity upon glycation were observed for partially hydrolyzed soy protein isolate with maltodextrin [
