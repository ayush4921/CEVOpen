<p>Like the emulsifying properties of a protein, its foaming properties also depend on its interfacial properties. Proteins adsorb to the airâ€“water interface and stabilize the foam bubbles by electrostatic and steric repulsive forces [
 <xref rid="B265-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">265</xref>]. Foaming properties are often represented by the foaming capacity and foam stability. High water solubility is a prerequisite of the protein to serve as a good foam stabilizer. Thus, the beneficial effects of glycation also positively impact its foaming properties [
 <xref rid="B266-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">266</xref>]. Increased solubility upon glycation is attributed to an increased hydrophilicity and enhanced hydrogen-bonding capacity of the protein due to the covalent attachment of hydrophilic carbohydrates and the modification of the protein net charge, contributing to greater repulsion between protein molecules [
