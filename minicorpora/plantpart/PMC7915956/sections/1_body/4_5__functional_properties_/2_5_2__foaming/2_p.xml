<p>Wen et al. [
 <xref rid="B129-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>] showed that glycation of soy protein isolate with lentinan by wet heating enhanced its foaming capacity and foam stability. This effect was even further promoted by using ultrasound-assisted wet heating since it enhanced the degree of glycation, which led to greater improvement of solubility, an increase in the random structure of the protein, as well as an increase of viscosity [

The foam stability of rice protein isolate could be increased by up to 2.74 times upon its glycation with dextran, depending on the ratio of protein to polysaccharide used. The improvement was ascribed to the increased solubility of the rice protein–dextran conjugate [
