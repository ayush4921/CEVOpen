<p>One safe and effective modification method for the improvement of film properties is the glycation or crosslinking of proteins with carbohydrates [

 <xref rid="B202-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">202</xref>] showed that the glycation of peanut protein isolate with xylose led to films with a 77% increase in tensile strength, a 67% elongation increase, and a solubility decrease from 96.6% to 43.4% compared to peanut protein isolate films. These enhanced mechanical properties and water resistance could be correlated with the increased protein surface hydrophobicity and sulfhydryl group content with the addition upon glycation with xylose [

 <xref rid="B272-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">272</xref>]. The importance of optimizing the degree of glycation to achieve the optimal outcome was demonstrated for films from wild almond protein. Grafting the protein with gum arabic for up to six days increased the tensile strength and the elongation of the films, while longer reaction times showed adverse effects [
