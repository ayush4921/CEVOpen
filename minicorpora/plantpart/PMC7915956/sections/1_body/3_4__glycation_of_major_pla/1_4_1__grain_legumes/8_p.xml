<p>Although peanut is generally considered an oilseed due to its high oil content of 49%, it belongs to the family of grain legumes [
 <xref rid="B210-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">210</xref>]. Despite the strong commercial focus on peanut oil, peanuts contain up to 26% protein, with a well-balanced amino acid composition and a high nutritional value [
 <xref rid="B210-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">210</xref>]. Peanut protein concentrates and isolates are produced from defatted peanut flour, the side product of peanut oil production, by pressing and/or solvent extraction [

 <xref rid="B212-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">212</xref>]. However, these properties are inferior to those of soy protein [

 <xref rid="B196-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">196</xref>] that glycation of peanut protein isolate with dextran led to better thermal stability, solubility, and emulsifying and foaming properties, peanut proteins have been the subject of numerous glycation studies. Notably, these studies oftentimes employ novel approaches for the manufacturing of conjugates such as wet treatment with ultrasonication [

 <xref rid="B205-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">205</xref>]. One very important aspect to keep in mind is the allergenic potential of peanut proteins. A study by Gruber et al. [
 <xref rid="B214-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">214</xref>] provided evidence that the allergenic activity of peanut agglutinin might be decreased by the Maillard reaction, depending on the coupled carbohydrate. However, upon roasting peanuts, it has been observed that the formation of neoepitopes due to the Maillard reaction can increases IgE reactivity, hence their allergenicity [

 <xref rid="B215-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">215</xref>]. Future glycation studies on peanut proteins should therefore carefully examine the potential allergenicity of the manufactured compounds.
