<p>Other relevant grain legumes include beans. Due to their high protein content, easy cultivation, and nitrogen-fixing capacity, they bear a high potential as sustainable protein source. However, their application is still negligible due to their limited protein techno-functionality [

Glycation of proteins derived from bean varieties such as black or mung beans with carbohydrates of different molecular sizes such as glucose or dextran increased the water solubility and lowered the surface hydrophobicity of these proteins as a consequence of the hydrophilicity of the attached carbohydrate moiety [
