<p>The most recent studies on the glycation of soy proteins focus on novel manufacturing techniques involving wet treatments with additional ultrasonication, pressure treatment, or irradiation [

 <xref rid="B170-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">170</xref>]. It was shown that these additional treatments improve the functionality even further compared to conventional wet heating. Applying ultrasound treatment during wet heating increased the degree of glycation by 1.91 compared with traditional wet heating as well as the techno-functional performance of the glycated soy proteins [

Compared to emulsions stabilized by soy protein isolate and conventionally glycated soy protein isolate, the use of soy protein isolate that was glycated under the influence of irradiation led to lower creaming, oiling off, particle size, and flocculation degree after three freezeâ€“thaw cycles of the emulsions [
