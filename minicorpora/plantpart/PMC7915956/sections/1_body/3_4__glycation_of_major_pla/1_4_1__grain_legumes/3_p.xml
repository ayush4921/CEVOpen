<p>Soy proteins being one of the most relevant plant proteins, their glycation has been studied extensively with various reducing carbohydrates ranging from glucose over dextran and maltodextrin to more exotic candidates such as lentinan or seaweed polysaccharides (
 <xref rid="foods-10-00376-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The vast majority of these studies focus on the techno-functional impact of the glycation. Here, emulsifying properties received the most attention. Finding the most suitable reaction conditions (ratio, temperature, time, relative humidity, manufacturing technique) for each soy proteinâ€“carbohydrate pair is crucial for the positive manipulation of techno-functional properties. The performance of glycated soy proteins can often be correlated with the degree of glycation, i.e., the amount of carbohydrate molecules linked to one protein molecule [
 <xref rid="B119-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. The optimal degree of glycation again depends on the molecular weight of the carbohydrate [

 <xref rid="B127-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>] compared to emulsions stabilized by non-glycated soy proteins. Changes in the secondary and tertiary structure of the protein, as well as their increased molecular weight, suggest that the conjugated carbohydrates on the emulsion-droplet surface provide steric stabilization against these environmental influences [
 <xref rid="B120-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. Similar observations were made for the foaming properties of glycated soy proteins [
