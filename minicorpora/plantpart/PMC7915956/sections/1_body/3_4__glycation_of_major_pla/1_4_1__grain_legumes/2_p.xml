<p>The commercially most important plant protein is soy protein [
 <xref rid="B116-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. Soy protein is extracted from 
 <italic>Glycine max</italic>, an oilseed legume with a high protein content of 35–40% and a well-balanced amino acid composition [
 <xref rid="B3-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The most refined form of soy protein is soy protein isolate (SPI), with a protein content &gt;90% produced by alkali extraction and isoelectric precipitation at the isoelectric point of the proteins around pH 4–5 [

Besides texturizing soy protein by extrusion in order to use it in vegetarian meat alternatives, soy protein is widely used as a techno-functional ingredient for water and fat binding, emulsification, foaming, and gelation in formulated foods [
 <xref rid="B3-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, the techno-functionality of commercial soy protein strongly depends upon the extraction method utilized for its preparation, which can severely affect its water solubility [

 <xref rid="B3-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In the case of soy-derived ingredients, their high allergenicity is an additional concern. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) lists soybeans among the eight major foods or food groups that account for 90% of food allergies [
