<p>Another emphasis of glycation studies on soy proteins is their allergenic potential. Glycation-induced changes in the secondary protein structure that affect the antigenicity [

 <xref rid="B134-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>]. However, another study using dextran and various reaction conditions showed that glycation may reduce or increase the immunoreactivity of soy protein hydrolysate depending on the blood serum used for the experiments [
