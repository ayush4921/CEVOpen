<p>Due to its unique structure-forming abilities, wheat gluten is one of the most researched cereal proteins [
 <xref rid="B221-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">221</xref>]. However, difficulties associated with its use for techno-functional purposes are its strong protein–protein interactions via hydrogen bonding and the resulting water-insoluble protein aggregates [

 <xref rid="B224-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">224</xref>]. Further studies demonstrated that the glycation of deamidated wheat protein with dextran enhanced its properties as an emulsifier due to an increase in solubility of the protein, especially around its isoelectric point, and additional steric repulsion caused by great changes in the protein’s secondary structure upon covalent coupling with dextran [
