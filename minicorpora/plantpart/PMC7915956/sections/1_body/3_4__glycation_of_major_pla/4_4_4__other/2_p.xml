<p>Examples include potatoes, which are primarily used for starch production. Potato proteins recovered from the side stream and glycated with galactose and galactooligosaccharides were shown to exhibit increased stability to heat and pH changes, as well as a higher antioxidant activity and better emulsification properties, especially at lower pH [
