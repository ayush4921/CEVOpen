<p>Apart from the most utilized sources of plant proteins, further plant-derived proteins with lower to no commercial interest were used for glycation studies in recent years. These proteins mostly originate from plants that are not primarily used for protein extraction or parts of plants that are not utilized at all (e.g., peel, seeds). These side-stream proteins oftentimes have no interesting techno-functionalities and are usually not recovered. Glycation provides an opportunity to increase their application potential and hence the total amount of usable protein from certain plants.</p>
