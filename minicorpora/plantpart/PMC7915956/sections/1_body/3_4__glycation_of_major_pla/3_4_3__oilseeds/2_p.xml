<p>Glycating these proteins with a reducing carbohydrate via the first step of the Maillard reaction has been demonstrated to be a viable method to overcome this problem. Studies by Pirestani et al. [

 <xref rid="B245-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">245</xref>] suggest that glycating canola protein with gum arabic leads to changes in the secondary and tertiary protein structure, resulting in the reduction of thermal aggregation, increased solubility, and emulsifying properties—especially at low pH values—compared to the sole canola protein isolate. Qu et al. [
 <xref rid="B246-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">246</xref>] obtained the same results for rapeseed protein conjugated with dextran. The authors claimed a decrease of the surface hydrophobicity, an unfolding of the secondary structure, and an increase in the molecular weight. The substantial changes of the protein’s structure led to improved solubility, thermal stability, and emulsifying properties. Another aspect other than the stabilization of disperse systems is the antioxidant capacity of these proteins. Glycation with xylose was able to equip sesame protein hydrolysate with antioxidant properties. Its addition to cold-pressed sesame oil led to a significant improvement of the oxidative stability and prevented the loss of tocopherol, making it an excellent functional clean-label ingredient [
