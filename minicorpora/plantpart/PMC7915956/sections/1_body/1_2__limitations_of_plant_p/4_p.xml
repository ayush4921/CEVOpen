<p>Other concerns include the antinutritional and allergenic properties of plant proteins. Protein and amino acid digestibility can be diminished by the inhibition of digestive enzymes by protease inhibitors from legumes [

Moreover, untreated plant-protein preparations made from soy or pea protein often exhibit an undesired bitter off-taste associated with adhering saponins and volatile off-flavors caused by fat oxidation products such as alcohols, aldehydes, and ketones [
