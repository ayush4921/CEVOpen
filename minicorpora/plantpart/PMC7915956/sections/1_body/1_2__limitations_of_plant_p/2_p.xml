<p>So far, several reasons have prevented the broad substitution of plant proteins for animal-derived proteins in food. In addition to their lower nutritional values and higher costs associated with their recovery and isolation from plant material or side streams, the techno-functionality of plant proteins is limited [

The fundamental evolutionary difference in the purpose of animal- and plant-derived proteins causes most of the differences in their techno-functionalities. Other than plant proteins, which mainly serve as globular storage proteins with a high molecular weight as biological reserve for the development of the plant [
 <xref rid="B23-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], animal-derived proteins are often involved in the formation of unique superstructures (e.g., casein micelles, muscle fibers) that cannot be found in plants [
