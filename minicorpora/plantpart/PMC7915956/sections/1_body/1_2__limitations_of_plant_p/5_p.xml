<p>The above stated reasons render the replacement of animal-derived proteins as food ingredients with specific techno-functionalities by plant proteins very challenging [
 <xref rid="B24-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Several efforts have been made to improve the application potential of plant proteins. Chemical or enzymatical hydrolysis were shown to improve the solubility of plant proteins [

 <xref rid="B36-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="B37-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. However, protein hydrolysates are often associated with a strong bitter and/or astringent off-taste [
 <xref rid="B38-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Other chemical approaches, such as deamidation, in which amide side chains of amino acids such as asparagine and glutamine are transformed into acidic groups by hydrolysis of the amide bond, delivered effective results in improving water solubility [

 <xref rid="B40-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. However, deamidation and other chemical approaches such as acetylation, lipophilization (i.e., the esterification of a protein with a lipophilic moiety such as palmitic [

 <xref rid="B42-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]), succinylation, or phosphorylation have the drawback of leading to problems with food-safety regulations arising from the requirement of various chemicals, which in some cases are toxic [

 <xref rid="B43-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Another very effective modification method to enhance the techno-functional properties of food proteins that belongs to the category of chemical modifications is their glycation [

 <xref rid="B46-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Glycation—sometimes also referred to as non-enzymatic glycosylation—occurs during the initial stage of the Maillard reaction, when proteins and reducing carbohydrates form a covalent bond under the influence of heat [

 <xref rid="B47-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In contrast to other chemical methods, the Maillard reaction is a naturally and spontaneously occurring reaction that does not require additional chemicals and takes place under controlled and safe conditions [
 <xref rid="B45-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,
 <xref rid="B48-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,
 <xref rid="B49-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. This makes the glycation of food proteins an approach that is in line with the trend toward natural “clean-label” ingredients.
