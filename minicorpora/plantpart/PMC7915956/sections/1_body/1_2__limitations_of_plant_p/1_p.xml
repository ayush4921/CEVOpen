<p>In food, proteins serve a dual role as nutrients and structural building blocks. The latter is generally referred to as the techno-functionality of the protein [
 <xref rid="B20-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The interaction capacity with other proteins, polysaccharides, or lipids is essential for protein techno-functionality, and is determined by the protein conformation and the chemical and steric properties of the protein surface [
 <xref rid="B21-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Techno-functional properties related to interaction capacity are solubility, water, fat, and flavor binding, as well as interfacial properties affecting emulsifying and foaming behavior [
 <xref rid="B21-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Due to the presence of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic amino acid side chains, proteins are amphiphilic biopolymers [
 <xref rid="B22-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. If the protein structure, and thus the interaction capacity, changes (e.g., due to conditions that the protein is exposed to during food processing, by alterations in the composition of the food matrix, or by changing the source of the protein), techno-functional properties will be affected as a result [
