<p>An oftentimes important prerequisite and excellent indicator for techno-functional properties in food systems such as emulsification, gelation, or foaming is the solubility of the protein in aqueous media. It is also crucial in low-viscosity applications such as beverages, where gravitational separation and turbidity are undesired [
