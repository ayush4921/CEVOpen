<p>In parallel, the development of an industrially feasible production method for glycated plant proteins needs to be pushed. Glycated proteins cannot yet be provided as commercial food ingredients, because many of the methods developed to produce glycoconjugates are based on lab-scale production methods and are not easy to scale up. The established dry-state method involves expensive freeze-drying and is not easily controllable in terms of unwanted reaction products [

However, the demand for an economically feasible production method has become even more crucial due to the necessity of a more sustainable food production system involving the incorporation of more highly functional plant-based ingredients [
 <xref rid="B274-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">274</xref>]. Overall, the promising techno-functional properties of glycated plant proteins as demonstrated in numerous studies are a great driving force for future research that aims to overcome the current challenges associated with their production and application.
