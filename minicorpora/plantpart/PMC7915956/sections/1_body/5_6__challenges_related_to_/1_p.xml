<p>The glycation of plant proteins bears a great potential to broaden their field of application as techno-functional food ingredients. However, despite the numerous studies dealing with their controlled glycation and subsequent effects on their properties, an overall systematic approach to understand the relationship between the structure of the glycoconjugates and the resulting techno-functional alterations has not yet fully been established. Due to the incomplete knowledge of how glycation reaction conditions (e.g., glycation method, ratio of protein to carbohydrate, type of carbohydrate/protein, temperature, time, relative humidity, pretreatments) affect the structure of the resulting molecule and consequently its performance as a techno-functional food ingredient, it is not possible yet to achieve tailor-made techno-functionalities. Better understanding of the structureâ€“function relationship might provide guidance on how to optimize the performance of glycated plant proteins, since they were shown to still be slightly inferior to animal-derived proteins [
