<p>Another shortcoming is the very limited amount of studies investigating the performance of glycated plant proteins in complex food matrices, rather than simple-model systems such as oil-in-water emulsions. One of these rather rare studies investigated the sensory acceptability and textural properties of bread and sponge cake fortified with glycated cowpea protein isolates. It was shown that glycated cowpea protein led to softer bread dough and a high sensory acceptability. It was furthermore possible to replace 20% of egg with the glycated protein in cake dough without impairing sensory properties [

Another example is a study of spray-dried soy beverage formulations in which soy drink powders made with soy proteinâ€“dextran conjugates had improved solubility and reconstitution properties as a consequence of the increased denaturation temperature of the glycated proteins compared to unconjugated ones [
