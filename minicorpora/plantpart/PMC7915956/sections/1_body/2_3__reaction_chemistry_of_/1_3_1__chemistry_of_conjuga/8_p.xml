<p>Besides the Maillard reaction, thermal treatment of protein-containing systems is known to lead to post-translational modification of reactive amino acid side chains without reducing sugars. These reactions can occur simultaneously with the Maillard reaction, which result in crosslinking of proteins through the formation of sugar-free amino acid crosslinks such as isopeptides and dehydroalanine adducts. This happens in particular when the proteins are heated dry (e.g., heating gluten at 130 °C for 1 h) [
