<p>Furthermore, the Amadori products can be formed from the deoxyosones by enolization, dehydration, and deamination. [

Due to their reactive α-dicarbonyl partial structure, these substances can further react with amino acid side chains of proteins, e.g., ε-amino group of lysine and guanidino group of arginine and/or other carbohydrate degradation products, such as the fission products glyoxal, glycolaldehyde, methylglyoxal, 2,3-butanedione, or other reactive carbohydrate degradation products, to form various downstream products [

 <sc>l</sc>-norleucine), which is a typical substance in the crust of wheat bread (up to 19.3 mg/kg), is formed mainly in the presence of di- and oligosaccharides and glycosylated isomaltol derivatives in the late stage of the Maillard reaction [

 <sc>l-</sc>norleucine), which can be determined after alkaline or enzymatic hydrolysis by using proteinases such as pepsin and pronase E, and peptidases such as aminopeptidase M and prolidase [

 <xref rid="B78-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. It is likely that peptide- and protein-bound pyrraline, which is derived from peptides and proteins, is more widely distributed in foods than free pyrraline, which is derived from free amino acids [

Besides the ε-amino groups of lysine, the guanidino groups of protein-bound arginine also react with α-dicarbonyl compounds, e.g., to GLARG (1-(4-amino-4-carboxybutyl)-2-imino-5-oxo-imidazolidine), CMA (N7-carboxymethyl-arginine), ornithoimidazoline (N

In addition to the modification of individual amino acid side chains, the formation of cross-linked amino acids was also observed to act as coupling points of carbohydrate-induced protein crosslinks resulting in an oligomerization of, for example, β-lactoglobulin [
