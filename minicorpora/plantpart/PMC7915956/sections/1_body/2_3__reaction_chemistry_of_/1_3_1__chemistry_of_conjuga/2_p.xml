<p>Protein glycation is commonly regarded as the initial stage of the Maillard reaction. The first reaction of the initial stage is the condensation reaction between the carbonyl groups of reducing carbohydrates and the ε-amino groups of lysine, or, to a lesser extent, the 
 <italic>α</italic>-amino groups of terminal amino acids and the imidazole and indole groups of histidine and tryptophan, respectively [
