<p>The acid hydrolysis promotes the conversion of 1-deoxy-fructosyl-

 <sup>ε</sup>-(2-furoylmethyl)-
 <sc>l</sc>-lysine (furosine), a compound that can be quantified after protein hydrolysis [

 <sc>l</sc>-lysine may be of interest as marker compounds to indicate the quality of the conjugation process. Since furosine and pyridosine are formed at an early stage of the Maillard reaction, their concentration in combination with an analysis of the browning index can show the degree of conjugation of polysaccharides and proteins [
