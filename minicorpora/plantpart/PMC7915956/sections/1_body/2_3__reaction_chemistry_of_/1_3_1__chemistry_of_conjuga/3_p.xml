<p>The intermediate stage of the Maillard reaction starts with the degradation of the Amadori/Heyns products. This stage includes dehydration and fission, mainly by dealdolization and Strecker degradation, the interaction of amino acids and dicarbonyl compounds. At neutral or acidic pH, they undergo 1,2-enolization with the subsequent formation of furfural or hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). At alkaline pH, the Amadori/Heyns products degrade via 2,3-enolization to reductones and a variety of fission products, e.g., acetol, pyruvaldehyde, and diacetyl. All these fission products are very reactive substances that immediately react further [

 <xref rid="B52-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The course of the final stage of the Maillard reaction depends on reaction conditions such as environment, and involves the dehydration and decomposition of the early reaction products via pathways such as the Strecker degradation [

A range of reactions including cyclizations, dehydrations, retroaldolizations, enolizations, oxidations, fragmentations, rearrangements, isomerizations, and further condensations result in the formation of a large amount of compounds that are still poorly characterized [
