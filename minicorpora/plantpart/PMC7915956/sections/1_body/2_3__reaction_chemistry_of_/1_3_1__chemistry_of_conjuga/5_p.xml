<p>In the following, a number of substances are listed that are typical for the different stages of the Maillard reaction, and therefore also serve as indicators of it (

Under the reaction of reducing sugars, a variety of partial reactions that lead to the modification of free or protein-bound amino acids can take place. Particularly the residues of the amino acids lysine and arginine are subject to these modifications. Many of these Amadori products, e.g., N
 <sup>ε</sup>-fructosyllysine or N
 <sup>ε</sup>-lactulosyllysine, could be found in dried, heated or stored food as well as in protein isolates or concentrates (e.g., milk proteins) [

 <xref rid="B63-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. While lysine is contained in sufficient quantity in proteins of animal source, it occurs less frequently in many vegetable proteins. For this reason, lysine often represents the limiting essential amino acid in these vegetable proteins [

 <sup>ε</sup>-deoxyhexosyl derivatives of lysine in particular have been quantitatively investigated after acid hydrolysis as furosine (N
 <sup>ε</sup>-(2-furoylmethy)-lysine) and pyridosine (6-(5-hydroxy-2-methyl-4-oxo-4H-pyridin-1-yl)-
 <sc>l</sc>-norleucine) [
