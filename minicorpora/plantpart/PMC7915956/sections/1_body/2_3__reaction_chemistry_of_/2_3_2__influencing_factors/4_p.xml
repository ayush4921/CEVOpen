<p>The water activity (

 <italic>a</italic>
 <sub>w</sub>, the reactants are more concentrated [
 <xref rid="B50-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. However, if the system is so concentrated that diffusion is impeded, the reaction rate decreases, as in the case of powders, and in the glassy state (minimum

 <sub>w</sub> ~ 0.4) [

 <xref rid="B85-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Diffusion and molecular mobility can be increased by increasing the

 <sub>w</sub>. This, in turn, generally increases the rate and extent of the glycation reaction. The highest reaction velocity is achieved at water activities of 0.5â€“0.8 [

 <xref rid="B44-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. However, a very high water concentration/

 <sub>w</sub> slows down the Maillard reaction due to dilution of the reactants [
