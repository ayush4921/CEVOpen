<p>Increased temperatures and longer heating times lead to an increase in the reactivity rate between the reducing sugar and the amino groups [

 <xref rid="B50-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Temperature also affects the conformation of the reactants, and thus the accessibility to reactive groups of proteins and carbohydrates [
 <xref rid="B85-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Heat-induced conformational changes can either lead to a higher reactivity due to a higher abundance of the more reactive open-chain form of reducing sugar molecules [
 <xref rid="B50-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], or to limited reactivity due to denaturation and aggregation of proteins causing the amino groups to be less accessible for the glycation reaction [
