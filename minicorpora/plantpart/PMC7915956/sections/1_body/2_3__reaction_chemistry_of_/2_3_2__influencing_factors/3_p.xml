<p>Additionally, the pH plays an important role. At higher pH values, the open-chain form of the sugar and the unprotonated form of the amino group, as the reactive forms, favor the Maillard reaction [

This equilibrium is furthermore dependent on the pKa value of amino group. The optimal pH is typically in the slightly alkaline pH range [
