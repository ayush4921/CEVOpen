<p>The techniques used for the preparation of glycated proteins involve the control and monitoring of the critical reaction conditions, in particular temperature and relative humidity (RH) [
 <xref rid="B94-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. To date, the most frequently used methods to produce glycated proteins are either dry-state or wet-state reaction methods [
 <xref rid="B44-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. However, both approaches have drawbacks in terms of commercialization, and the production of techno-functional glycated proteins for industry use at pilot or large scales is not possible as of yet. Therefore, novel techniques are increasingly being explored and employed. In the following section, existing dry- and wet-state methods, as well as novel preparation techniques, are briefly reviewed.
