<p>Recently, novel approaches to the production of protein–carbohydrate conjugates have been developed, since the conventional dry- and wet-state heating methods are either too expensive or not efficient enough for industrial applications. A review on this topic was recently published by Doost et al. [

Another approach is high-pressure pre-treatment of the protein dispersion to induce unfolding and structural changes that facilitate glycation in a subsequent heating step [

 <xref rid="B109-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. A further novel technique to produce glycated proteins is the physical structuring of protein–carbohydrate dispersions into fine fibers via electrospinning [

 <xref rid="B111-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. The large surface-to-volume ratio, the close molecular contact, and the high concentration of the reactants inside these fibers facilitate glycation upon heat treatment [
