<p>In order to reduce the heating time and avoid the need for freeze-drying, wet-state heating has been proposed. An aqueous dispersion of proteins and carbohydrates at a defined ratio is heated under controlled temperatures [

 <xref rid="B100-foods-10-00376" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. Despite the simplification of the process, the wet-state approach also has some drawbacks. Compared to the dry-state method, the concentrations of the reactants are low, causing yields to be low [
