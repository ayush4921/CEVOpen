<p id="p0285">The ultrasound method is used to find its used in several applications, such as assessing emulsions droplet size and ability to concentrate, observing the concentration of suspensions and aqueous phase, monitoring fat crystallization, and monitoring of creaming profiles in emulsions and suspensions; in particular for online observation of these properties throughout processing. It is a fast, accurate, non-invasive, and non-destructive method which can be implemented to a condensed or optically opaque device. This can also be quickly modified for online measurements, which would be responsible for monitoring operations in the food processing industry.</p>
