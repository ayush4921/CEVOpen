<p id="p0295">Ultrasound of low intensity is quite economical and finds its application in the agricultural/food sector. For several years it has been recognized the utility of high-intensity ultrasound to modify the physical and chemical properties of food. However, it was only recently that manufactures started adapting laboratory-scale technology to large-scale processing operations. The increased use of high-intensity ultrasound is primarily based on the availability of low-cost instrumentation, which has been shown to have substantial benefits over alternative technologies.</p>
