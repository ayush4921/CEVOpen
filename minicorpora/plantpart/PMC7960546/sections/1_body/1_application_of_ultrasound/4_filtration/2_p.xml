<p id="p0070">In combination with different food unit operations, ultrasound was found to improve the processes. Filtration has long been used as an effective techniques for efficient separation of solids by mother's liquor or liquid processing. Difficulty regarding fouling or polarization in concentration developed through filtrates or cake filter being deposited above the membrane surface as the main process matter. This issue caused the reduction in the efficiency of filtration. Ultrasound energy is therefore successful against such an issue 
 <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. When ultrasound is applied during the filtration process the accumulation of retentive layers occurs above the membrane layer that causes polarization, it concentration gets distorted, but the intrinsic membrane permeability is left undisturbed. These leads to increased flux and decreased resistant flow

 <xref rid="b0465" ref-type="bibr">[93]</xref>. Although, optimizing velocity in ultrasound is of utmost importance to avoid damages formed inside filters

 <xref rid="b0900" ref-type="bibr">[180]</xref>. Ultrasound combined with filters, improves the life of filter through prevention of membrane caking and clogging, enabling continuing cavity around filter surface

 <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> reported that lower frequency ultrasound could help with coordinating membrane foul by its ease in removing particles through the cake layer. By this way, the acoustic filtrated process increases efficiency in processed items and reduces safety concerns. All of the above-mentioned factors are important in promoting the filtration process and are developed being ultrasonic-assisted filtration methods by several companies that are an asset for pre-occurring vibration screens. Although, the growth in this area is reduced by the use of single transducers with low power capacity, which means that newer power transducers could enhance acoustic filtration and improve their ability for large-scale use with vibration amplifiers
