<p id="p0075">Dispersions and emulsions often contain surfactants for stabilization purposes. The surfactants retard the collection inside the liquid phase about the dispersed matter. The surfactants thereby develop an additional layer around every particle. Although similar surfactants, being substantially stabilized, encapsulates gaseous bubble suspended inside liquid stages. The surfactant consumed in this way, the emulsion or dispersion quality reduces with the obtainment of erroneous particle size measurements 
 <xref rid="b0350" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>. For decreasing the difficulty in stable gas bubbles, decrease the number of bubbles and favour emulsification, liquids particularly degassed through sonication. Ultrasound devices can produce acoustic cavitation which means the formation and the collapse of air bubbles in the system. The collapse of air bubbles can facilitate the releasing of reactive radicals promoting chemical reactions

 <xref rid="b0335" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>. As the acoustic power increases, the mean size and bubble population increased. This could increase the shear forces generated on the collapse of bubbles, facilitating the disruption of oil droplets. These changes reduce the size of oil droplets and thereby improve emulsion stability
