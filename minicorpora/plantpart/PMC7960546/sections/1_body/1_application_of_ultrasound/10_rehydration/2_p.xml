<p id="p0125">Food items that have beendried for preservation are rehydrated through immersion in warm liquids before use. Rehydration process helps specify items towards function regeneration with recovered property. Rehydration method consist about 3 sequential procedures: absorption of water, leaching swells of the product, and soluble solids 
 <xref rid="b0865" ref-type="bibr">[173]</xref>. This is used as an indicator of any damage or disruption caused by the dehydration process. Some modifications in the reconstituted product's properties are the result of differences in its structure and composition 
 <xref rid="b0550" ref-type="bibr">[110]</xref>. It has been documented that the rehydration level varies significantly above the level of structure or cell damage inside of the food material due to dehydration. Thereby, pretreatment was used prior rehydration process for reducing shrinkage that boost product properties and efficient optimization is achieved.
