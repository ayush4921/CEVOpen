 <xref rid="b0885" ref-type="bibr">[177]</xref> monitored kiwifruit from 0 to 30 min with ultrasound ranging 20 kHz and observed increase in rehydrated ratio that lowered the rehydration period for large ultrasonic tissue tunnels and pores. Ultrasound treated dehydrated osmotic samples, where rehydrated samples reported higher rehydration ratios due to microporous channel ultrasound forming

 <xref rid="b0460" ref-type="bibr">[92]</xref> used pretreatment of ultrasound in spine gourd prior drying, in which rehydration kinetics produced a precise improvement for rehydration ratio that might be due to rehydration pretreatment formed cavity with capillary. Ultrasound has been shown to cause reduced rehydration times and is also used to rehydrate dried food grains. Miano et al. 
 <xref rid="b0575" ref-type="bibr">[115]</xref> suggested the ultrasound application to improve the mung beans hydration period that minimized the duration taken for processing as well. Additionally with no difference in starch properties, it successfully increases the bean germination rate, ideal for sprouting. Similar results for sorghum hydration were found, in which ultrasound increased the amount of liquid absorption and equilibrium moisture content (EMC)
