<p id="p0130">As a pretreatment, ultrasound has been used to dry, dehydrate and rehydrate products. Tao et al. 
 <xref rid="b0835" ref-type="bibr">[167]</xref> evaluated samples in white cabbage for 1131.1 W/m
 <sup>2</sup> that stated rehydration levels for sonicated samples were greater than those of the controls. Similar outcomes for dried green pepper have also been observed 
 <xref rid="b0820" ref-type="bibr">[164]</xref>. Rehydration ratio measures the capacity of the dried/dehydrated product to retain water, that is dependent primarily on pores distribution inside microstructure of items 
 <xref rid="b0850" ref-type="bibr">[170]</xref>. Rehydrated proportion aroused to be highest in case of sonication treated shiitake mushroom, which showed high capacity of water absorption, compared with controlled products with rest methods such as blanching, freezing and osmotic dehydration for 4.58 value 
 <xref rid="b0960" ref-type="bibr">[192]</xref>. Aksoy et al. 
 <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> have suggested in samples treated with ultrasound displayed high ratio of rehydration in case of minced flesh relative to control samples at 35 °C and 25 kHz. Similar results for the rehydration of ultrasound-treated dried carrots were reported 
 <xref rid="b0710" ref-type="bibr">[142]</xref>. Researchers have stated that ultrasound application may lead to the formation of pores and can develop higher internal stress 
 <xref rid="b0835" ref-type="bibr">[167]</xref>. Rojas et al. 
 <xref rid="b0730" ref-type="bibr">[146]</xref> reported that apple treatment with ethanol and ultrasound effectively increased the rehydration rate at 25 °C for 10 min.
