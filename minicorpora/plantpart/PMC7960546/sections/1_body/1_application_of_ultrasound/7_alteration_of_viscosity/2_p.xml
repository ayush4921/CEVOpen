<p id="p0090">Ultrasound may increase and decrease the viscosity, and the impact is either permanent or temporary, depending on its intensity 
 <xref rid="b0655" ref-type="bibr">[131]</xref>. Also, the ultrasound assists in processes such as homogenisation, cell dispersion, emulsification, intracellular content extraction, maturation, drying, enzyme activation and/or deactivation, and degassing. Ultrasound accelerates the fermentation of milk in the presence of bifidobacteria to manufacture yoghurt for the reason that cellulose separation is stimulated due to impulse galactosidase produced later the bacterial cells are demolished 
 <xref rid="b0770" ref-type="bibr">[154]</xref>. To form yoghurt more equivalent and adhesive, the ultrasound also disperses milk fat. Milk is a colloidal form composed of suspended fat globules in the solvent mixture, affluent in soluble sugar, sodium chloride and proteins. Moisten and fat are non-miscible fluids that appear to detach, and an ultrasound milk cure creates equivalent and uniformly allotted fat globules that permit the use of milk in a myriad of farm products. A review by Candrapala et al. 
 <xref rid="b0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> on the outcome of the ultrasound on casein and calcium manifest that the casein micelles and the concentration of calcium did not adjust, while the thickness of milk shrinked.
