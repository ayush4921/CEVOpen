<p id="p0085">This technique is based on a new principle about particle separation; the elevation in energy that applied to a low-frequency emulsion in ultrasound waves (&lt;30 kHz) was used to split the mixture into its water and oil sections

 <xref rid="b0570" ref-type="bibr">[114]</xref>. Before it is marketed, however, this principle must be further developed, as ultrasound waves that are high in potential easily utilize the opposing effect by giving rise to a firmer emulsion or dispersion to form. In the dairy field, cleaning the tissues used for protein collection/partition is a crucial procedure towards retaining the membrane's porosity and differentiation and restoring the plant to its native dimensions to reduce the fear of bacteriological impurity and produce appropriate goods. It can be seen in research done by Luján-Facundo et al. 
 <xref rid="b0530" ref-type="bibr">[106]</xref>, the ultrasound polished tissues efficiently, and its efficiency upsurge at bottom densities
