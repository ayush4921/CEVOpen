0: Food processing is the effective conversion of agricultural produce into consumer ready product with the objective of producing more appealing, shelf-stable, compact, and usable and value-added product  [22], which can involve single or multiple operation.
1: The raw food items can be processed using several conventional processes and preservation techniques namely drying, baking, boiling, salting, pickling, soaking, etc.
2: which are still used commonly and efficiently.
3: The most traditional food processing methods rely on the underlying theory of increasing heat in order to reduce microbial growth and retard growth of foodborne pathogens that make the food suitable for consumption  [122].
4: Such thermal processing requires high energy, yield low productivity and involve time-consuming procedures that require high external heat input/ consumption  [19].
5: There are numerous food items that are susceptible to viral or bacterial intoxication that are not suitable for heat processing.
6: Thus, these heat-sensitive food items on subjecting to thermal treatment can undergo changes at physical, chemical and microbial level including taste, color and textural modifications.
7: This has to lead to the demand for extensive research and development in optimizing the existing technologies and to develop creative and efficient alternative techniques  [116].
8: Some of the novel and innovative methods used in food processing are supercritical fluid extraction, high-pressure processing, pulsed electric field, cold plasma, ultrasound, and ultraviolet irradiation.
