0: The Ultrasound technique can be proved as a vital technique to help achieve the aim of sustainable green chemistry and extraction.
1: This technique in the field of chemical and food industry is well known for significantly influencing the processing rate of different processes used  [22],  [51].
2: Ultrasound-Assisted Extraction (UAE) operates on the principle of acoustic cavitation that damages the plant matrix cell walls and hence helps in the release of bioactive compounds  [171].
3: The ultrasound waves can propagate through any medium as a mechanical wave within a frequency range of 20 kHz to 100 MHz, by generating phases of expansions and compressions.
4: It can induce the formation, development and implosion of cavitation bubbles in a liquid media, when a high acoustic force is applied, which is commonly used for enhancement of several food processing methods  [166],  [193].
5: The spectrum of ultrasonic waves involves a variety of frequency range which commonly extends from more than the 20 kHz which is the audible range and up to 10 MHz which is less than the microwave frequencies.
6: The magnitude of the frequency that is associated to the ultrasonic effect, i.e., between 20 and 100 kHz, is governed by physical effects and has a wide range of application in non-destructive analytical techniques whereas, chemical effects were observed in the range of frequency in between 200 and 500 kHz  [171].
7: Ultrasound can be used in a wide range of application including processes like fermentation, emulsification, crystallization, reactions kinetics, and extraction technique.
