<p id="p0035">The Ultrasound technique can be proved as a vital technique to help achieve the aim of sustainable “green” chemistry and extraction. This technique in the field of chemical and food industry is well known for significantly influencing the processing rate of different processes used

 <xref rid="b0255" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Ultrasound-Assisted Extraction (UAE) operates on the principle of acoustic cavitation that damages the plant matrix cell walls and hence helps in the release of bioactive compounds 
 <xref rid="b0855" ref-type="bibr">[171]</xref>. The ultrasound waves can propagate through any medium as a mechanical wave within a frequency range of 20 kHz to 100 MHz, by generating phases of expansions and compressions. It can induce the formation, development and implosion of cavitation bubbles in a liquid media, when a high acoustic force is applied, which is commonly used for enhancement of several food processing methods

 <xref rid="b0965" ref-type="bibr">[193]</xref>. The spectrum of ultrasonic waves involves a variety of frequency range which commonly extends from more than the 20 kHz which is the audible range and up to 10 MHz which is less than the microwave frequencies. The magnitude of the frequency that is associated to the ultrasonic effect, i.e., between 20 and 100 kHz, is governed by physical effects and has a wide range of application in non-destructive analytical techniques whereas, chemical effects were observed in the range of frequency in between 200 and 500 kHz 
 <xref rid="b0855" ref-type="bibr">[171]</xref>. Ultrasound can be used in a wide range of application including processes like fermentation, emulsification, crystallization, reactions kinetics, and extraction technique.
