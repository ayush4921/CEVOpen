<p id="p0160">Combining UAE with microwave assisted extraction (MAE) is one of the most effective hybridized methods (UMAE) which provide quick and efficient extraction 
 <xref rid="b0785" ref-type="bibr">[157]</xref>. Several researchers have studied combination UMAE irradiation in natural extraction Cravotto and Binello, 
 <xref rid="b0225" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, but the considerate capability of the hybrid procedure is still not been appropriately utilized. We assume UMAE possess immense potential in academic as well as industrial research activities due to its highly efficiency and significantly shorter extraction period. This is a cost-efficient method for rapid sample preparation with newer process intensification strategies. Also, double simultaneous irradiation triggers additional along with synergistic effects towards vegetal matrix extraction phenomenon while non-metallic horns are only employed at moderate power. As defined in Cravotto and Cintas 
 <xref rid="b0230" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, horns made of Pyrex ®, quartz or Peek ® could be safely utilized till 90 W, beyond which material internal structure is destroyed irreversibly. But, it develops slight drawback as UMAE needs low marks of power by just two singly energy sources. Ultrasound significantly enhances the target extraction component via the cavitation phenomena. The effect of mechanical ultrasonication facilitates the withdrawal by plant body of soluble compounds by cell walls disruption promoting mass movement enabling access towards cell material by solvents. During the meantime, the entire sample is heated by microwave very fast triggering the movement of dissolved molecules. Simultaneously, irradiation improves the solvent penetration inside matrices promoting the solvation of analytes with typically increasing the solubility of target components.
