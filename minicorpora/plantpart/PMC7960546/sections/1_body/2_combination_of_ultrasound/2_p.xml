<p id="p0150">Altogether several methods were established affecting by UAE i.e. Fragmentation, erosion impact, sonoporation, local shear tension and plant structure destruction-detexturation. To explain, we have chosen to provide clear and separate proof of each influence. Yet most likely a mixture of effects occurs during the UAE. Perhaps these results are also sequential during the process of extraction. In addition, as a detailed mechanism about extreme mixture effect produced through ultrasound propagation inside liquid media provides the mass transfer enhancement increasing the movement of solute. The mixing effect occurs through acoustic streaming in the macroscopic scale, and acoustic microstreaming at a local stage 
 <xref rid="b0870" ref-type="bibr">[174]</xref>. The combinations of effects of mixing towards physical impact about ultrasound onto raw material can demonstrate improvement in ultrasonic extraction efficiency.
