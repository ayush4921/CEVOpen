<p id="p0180">Extraction is carried out by squeezing and expulsion for the making of sugar, wine and juices, or the drying out of bio-squander and in vegetable oil processing units. The squeezing procedure comprises a compression step to remove a liquid from the permeable matrix which contains the target compounds 
 <xref rid="b0500" ref-type="bibr">[100]</xref>. The fruit and vegetable tissue cells are encased by a membrane, and a cell wall situated in the centre lamella. The tough wall components protect the membranes and thus confining the extraction capacity by applying pressure 
 <xref rid="b0180" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. To attain superior extricates (quality and quantity versus time) through process intensification level, the combination of squeezing with other technologies such as ultrasound can be examined in a research sense. The average extrusion force, for the most part, diminishes with an increase in the amplitude of the ultrasound producing stronger extrudability
