<p id="p0215">The usage of ultrasound to dry out the apples osmotically has been found to accelerate the mass transfer rate of “water out” and “solute in” 
 <xref rid="b0790" ref-type="bibr">[158]</xref>. Diffusion coefficients of solvents were found to extend around 117% and 137% separately due to ultrasound pretreatment 
 <xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. The comparison of Ultrasound treatment with pulsed-vacuum treatment, yielded in excessive moisture losses and reduces gain of solid in cases of apple fruit 
 <xref rid="b0270" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. The prominent reduction of firm texture was because of ultrasonic treatment compared with specimen treated with pulsed vacuum and could be credited to extreme cell distortion and structure damages 
 <xref rid="b0270" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. Additionally, Deng and Zhao 
 <xref rid="b0270" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref> too detailed that ultrasonic treatment brought about in the more Tg (glass transition temperature), a reduce water activity, rehydration rate, and water content a more extreme rupturing of the structure, as well as fewer crevices and calcium take-up than pulsed vacuum. Stojanovic and Silva 
 <xref rid="b0800" ref-type="bibr">[160]</xref> also stated that ultrasound application improved the diffusion rates of moisture throughout osmotic dehydration of rabbit eye blueberries; though, this is related to the loss of anthocyanins and phenolics. In the case of melon dehydration through osmosis, the moisture diffusivity was found to decrease at the start of the process (for less than 30 min) due to involvement of sugar. In contrast, it enhanced when the process continued for longer durations (over 1 h) due to the rupturing of cellulase 
 <xref rid="b0330" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>. Gabaldon-Leyva et al. 
 <xref rid="b0345" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref> also observed that more moisture losses and the absorption of soluble solids during bell pepper processing resulted as a case of ultrasound treatment.
