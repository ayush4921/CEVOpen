<p id="p0220">Recently, Bchir et al. 
 <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> reported the effect of ultrasound assisted osmotic dehydration on the pomegranate seeds. The result showed that the ultrasound pretreatment involves a reduction in the osmotic solution temperature and favoring a reduction in the process cost. Also, the texture of ultrasound assisted osmotic dehydration sample showed more hardness and their microstructure compared to the fresh and osmotic dehydrated sample. Bozkir et al. 
 <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, evaluated the effect of ultrasound assisted osmotic dehydration on the drying behavior and quality properties of persimmon fruit. Ultrasound assisted osmotic dehydration demonstrated a significantly shortened the drying time, increased drying rates, and a 21% increase in effective water diffusivity by 30 min and caused the fewest changes to the quality characteristics of persimmon. The effect of ultrasonic pre-treatment on osmotic dehydration of kiwi slices was investigated by Prithani and Dash 
 <xref rid="b0680" ref-type="bibr">[136]</xref>. Ultrasound pre-treatment caused increased water losses along with limited solid gain as well. In addition, ultrasound pretreatment shows the effective moisture diffusivities with no shrinkage condition i.e. 3.864 × 10
