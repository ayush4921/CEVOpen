<p id="p0260">Solid-phase micro-extraction (SPME) and Liquid-phase micro-extraction (LPME) are the most common and widespread pretreatment methodologies. LPME is an easy and user-friendly procedure, but it always takes time and involves vast amounts of samples and organic solvents 
 <xref rid="b0390" ref-type="bibr">[78]</xref>. The SPME approach is based on the fundamental concepts of sorbent analyte absorption or adsorption 
 <xref rid="b0275" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref> and recent developments in this area are often concerned with the use of new sorbent materials
