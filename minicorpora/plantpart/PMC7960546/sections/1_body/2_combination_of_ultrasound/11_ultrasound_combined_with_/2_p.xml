<p id="p0235">The applied pressure within extent ranging about 100–1000 MPa at room temperature forms high-pressure processing (HPP) 
 <xref rid="b0410" ref-type="bibr">[82]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0805" ref-type="bibr">[161]</xref>. Mainly it is utilized for deactivation of pathogens along with vegetative microbes, yeasts including molds, but pressure treatment alone cannot accomplish noteworthy inactivation of spores and lower of enzymatic activity of certain enzymes 
 <xref rid="b0395" ref-type="bibr">[79]</xref>. Depending on the type of food, treatment durations can shift from 2 to 30 min in industrial applications 
 <xref rid="b0360" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>. In case where pressure is employed with surrounding temperatures, due to adiabatic heating, a 3 to 9 °C/100 MPa temperature enhancement takes place (that depends on the pressure transferring liquid along with treatment period)
