 <xref rid="b0945" ref-type="bibr">[189]</xref> studied the effect of the combined pretreatment of ultrahigh pressure and ultrasound (UHP-US) on the properties of vacuum freeze dried strawberry slices compared to UHP and US pretreatment alone. The results shows that UHP-US treatment reduced the drying duration and energy comsumption as well as improves the quality more pronouncedly. Gomes et al. 
 <xref rid="b0365" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref> showed promising results for prebiotic cranberry juice when US-HPP processes were used for processing. Solid conservation of fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) was gotten after the treatment. No basic changes after treatment appeared during the instrumental colour examination, soluble solids, pH, organic acids, bioactive components and antioxidant ability. In order to decide the fitting conditions for ultrasound-high pressure treatment (US-HPP) to fulfill, Lee et al.
