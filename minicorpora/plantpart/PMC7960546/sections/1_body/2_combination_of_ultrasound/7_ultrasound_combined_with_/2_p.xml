<p id="p0190">The Soxhlet extraction is customarily utilized to expel fats and oils from their matrix. This framework was designed in 1879 and has been broadly utilized in different areas such as environment, agricultural/food products and indeed pharmaceuticals

Furthermore, the soxhlet extraction has a few downsides such as long working time (a few hours), huge sums of solvents, vapourisation and a concentration step fundamental towards the end of the extraction. Only a few forms within the theory/literature have recorded the combining of Soxhlet e xtraction with evolved strategies, such as ultrasound, to quicken the extraction of fat and oil
