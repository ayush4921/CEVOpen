<p id="p0075">The insecticidal activity of the essential oil could be due to the effect of some of its major constituents, the effect of its minor constituents or the synergistic effect of several constituents [
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. An in vitro study reports that 
 <italic>M. pulegium</italic> was the most insecticidal species towards eggs and adults of 
 <italic>Mayetiola destructor</italic> which is the major pest of wheat in Morocco, compared to other seventeen species [
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. These authors report that there is a prominent difference between the level of mortality obtained with 
 <italic>M. pulegium</italic> essential oil and that obtained with other essential oils from other plants, including 
 <italic>M. viridis</italic> that has low insecticidal activity. The essential oil from 
 <italic>M. pulegium</italic> has the most effective licicidal and niticidal effects toward the head louse, 
 <italic>Pediculus capitis</italic>, in comparison with 
 <italic>Thymus brousyonettii</italic> (Lamiaceae), 
 <italic>Chenofiodium ambrorioides</italic> (Chenopodiaceae), and 
 <italic>Ruta chalepensis</italic> (Rutaceae) [
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Essential oils are natural alternative products to synthetic insecticides due to their physicochemical properties of being biodegradable and volatile so that there is no risk of residues deposit on treated crops [
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Moreover, essential oils are less toxic to mammals since they act on octopaminergic sites in parasitic insects. 
 <italic>M. pulegium</italic> essential oil has the most anti-leishmanial effect against 
 <italic>Leishmania major</italic>. 
 <italic>M. pulegium</italic> essential oil caused an inhibition of 100% of the germination of 
 <italic>Medicago sativa</italic> seeds [
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The allelopathic activity of 
 <italic>M. pulegium</italic> essential oil towards 
 <italic>Medicago sativa</italic> seeds germination wasn't affected by the plant drying process before hydro-distillation [
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. These results approve that Mentha essential oils are a valuable source of bioactive molecules with different potential applications in agricultural and medical fields.
