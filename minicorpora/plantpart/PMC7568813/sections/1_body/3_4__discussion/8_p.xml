<p>Sunflower oil was studied in dentinal hypersensitivity by Cheema et al. in 2014 [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Oil pulling therapy was used instead of local application. Oil pulling was performed in the following way. On an empty stomach, 10 ml of sunflower oil was sipped, sucked, and swished for 20–25 minutes till oil lost its viscosity and turned milky white in colour and then was spit out, and the mouth was rinsed with water. It was observed that there was reduction in VAS scores in both cold-pressed sunflower oil and desensitizing tooth paste groups. However, statistically significant reduction in the mean VAS score of DH was detected in the group who performed oil pulling [
