 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table"> Table 1</xref> shows demographic characteristics of the sampled cases according to intervention type regarding hypersensitivity. The sesame oil group comprised 46 females (92%) and 4 males (8%), while the tooth paste group had 39 females (78%) and 11 males (22%). 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table"> Table 2</xref> shows comparison of tooth hypersensitivity degree between the two study groups before and after applying the interventions. Hypersensitivity degree before treatment in case of desensitizing tooth paste was 6.90 ± 1.04, and posttreatment showed a score of 4.70 ± 1.37. In case of sesame oil groups, subjects included had a score of 7.14 ± 0.90 which showed a drop to a score of 4.52 ± 1.16.
