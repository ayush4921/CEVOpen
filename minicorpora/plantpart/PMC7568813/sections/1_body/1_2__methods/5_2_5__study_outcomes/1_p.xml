<p>The primary outcome expected from the study was reduction in the dentinal hypersensitivity. Treatment outcome was calculated using a Visual Analogue Scale which records the sensitivity using a line of length of 10 cm. The line extremes represent the limits of pain a patient might experience from an external stimulus (0 = no pain; 10 = severe pain). Sensitivity scores for controlled air stimulus and tactile method at the beginning and at the 8th week after treatment were documented. Tooth sensitivity was recorded first by the tactile method in which the dentin surface was scratched using a sharp probe. Ten minutes following the tactile stimulation, patients' response to cold air was evaluated using a dental air syringe. The score was documented at the initial visit and at the 8th week, and the result was statistically analyzed.</p>
