<p>During the diagnostic procedure, patients were assessed for the sensitivity of teeth. Dentinal hypersensitivity was diagnosed after the proper history and proper assessment methods. Tooth sensitivity was recorded first by the tactile method in which dentin surface was scratched using a sharp probe. Ten minutes following the tactile stimulation, patients' response to cold air was evaluated using a dental air syringe. After completing the entire history and clinical examination, patients were informed about the study protocol and different interventions. By using a simple random method, from the diagnostic department, patients were recruited for the study. Out of 110 patients, six patients were not able to enter the study. Reasons were difficulty to come for the follow-up, travelling to a different place, coming under the exclusion criteria, or not meeting the inclusion criteria. Informed consent was taken from the patient before commencing the study. From 104 patients who entered the study, 52 patients were allotted in each group based on a simple chit system. Two of them lost to follow-up from each group constituting 100 patients in total who completed the study.
