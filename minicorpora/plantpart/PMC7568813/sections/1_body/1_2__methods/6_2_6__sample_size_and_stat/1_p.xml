<p>Sample size analyzed was 100 in number who reported back for follow-up after application of either desensitizing tooth paste or sesame oil. After data collection, data were filtered from any errors, coded, and fed to statistical software IBM SPSS version 21. The constructed graphs were obtained using Microsoft excel software. All statistical analyses were performed using two tailed tests with an alpha error of 0.05. 
 <italic>P</italic> value less than or equal to 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Descriptive statistics was used as frequencies, and percent was used to describe the frequency of each category for categorical data. Mean with standard deviation was used to describe quantitative variables (age and hypersensitivity level). The independent 
 <italic>t</italic>-test was used to compare the mean hypersensitivity level between the two groups, while repeated measures with adjusted 
 <italic>P</italic> value was used to compare the sensitivity level before and after intervention.
