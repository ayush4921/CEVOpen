<p>It is very important to choose the most appropriate encapsulating carrier or mixture of carriers to achieve higher retention of active material inside the particles, since composition can contribute to overall stability. For example, probiotics can be protected during the digestion process using 
 <italic>vegetable fat</italic> as the encapsulating carrier, thereby ensuring functionality [

 <italic>Vegetable fat</italic> has also been used to encapsulate Vitamin D3, since it has a suitable melting point (above room temperature, but not too high), which is important in avoiding decomposition of vitamin D3 during the particle formation process. Vegetable fat is also edible and commercially available. It is widely used to prepare ice cream, bread, and other food products [

 <italic>Palm stearin</italic> lipid has been used for SLM production due to its special triglyceride composition that promotes a disorganized, less crystalline structure to prevent rejection of the encapsulated bioactives during the solidification process [

 <xref rid="B39-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="B40-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Lipids with relatively low melting points have been studied extensively in microencapsulation; but the use of materials with high melting points is not as common. The use of high melting point lipids can be interesting for possibly increased stability compared to low melting point lipids [

 <italic>Carnauba wax</italic>, obtained from the Brazilian carnauba palm tree, is a solid lipid material consisting of a mixture of fatty esters, fatty alcohols, and fatty acids, with a high melting temperature (82 °C–86 °C). For example, Quercetin, a plant-derived flavonoid, was successfully microencapsulated by using carnauba wax for taste-masking [
 <xref rid="B42-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Lipid mixtures were used for encapsulation as well. Thus, mixtures composed of 
 <italic>palmitic acid</italic> with 
 <italic>oleic acid</italic> or 
 <italic>palm fat</italic> were used as carriers for encapsulation of Ginger oleoresin, a flavor ingredient also known as an antimicrobial and antioxidant agent [
 <xref rid="B43-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Ginger oleoresin has been encapsulated using a lipid matrix containing a mixture of solid and liquid lipids. In this study, 
 <italic>stearic acid</italic> was used as a solid lipid and 
 <italic>oleic acid</italic> as a liquid lipid [
 <xref rid="B44-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Solid lipid microparticles containing Ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) were synthesized, as well, using mixtures of 
 <italic>Lauric acid</italic> (LA)/
 <italic>Oleic acid</italic> (OA) at different ratios [
 <xref rid="B45-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. For the encapsulation of fish oil, 
 <italic>fully hydrogenated soybean oil</italic> was chosen as a solid lipid, since it is inexpensive material (widely used for the preparation of candles) and stable against oxidation [
 <xref rid="B46-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Curcumin was encapsulated in solid lipid microparticles formed from a lipid mixture containing 
 <italic>Babacu oil</italic> and 
 <italic>Tristearin</italic>, followed by incorporation into low-sugar mango jam [
