<p>The selection of surfactants to produce solid lipid microparticles is an important factor when considering incorporation into foodstuffs, since many of the compounds usually useful for particle stabilization are not of food grade. Among the GRAS surfactants, 
 <italic>protein concentrates</italic> and 
 <italic>isolates</italic> are used for microencapsulation. SLM containing Î²-carotene for incorporation into yogurts and vanilla ice creams was stabilized with 
 <italic>hydrolyzed soy protein isolate</italic> [

 <xref rid="B48-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Solid lipid microparticles can be produced from babacu oil as a lipid carrier, and denatured 
 <italic>whey protein isolate</italic> can be used as a stabilizer to inhibit quercetin degradation [
 <xref rid="B29-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Lacprodan 80 
 <italic>whey protein concentrate</italic> (WPC) has been used to produce microparticles containing a proanthocyanidin-rich cinnamon extract (PRCE) [
 <xref rid="B49-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Another emulsifier used for the SLM preparation is 
 <italic>plant</italic> or 
 <italic>animal lecithin</italic>. 
 <italic>Soy lecithin</italic> has been incorporated into the SLM containing vitamin B12 (Cyanocobalamin) [
 <xref rid="B50-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and vitamin D3 [
 <xref rid="B37-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Tween 80 and Span 60 were used as surfactants for the encapsulation of curcumin [
 <xref rid="B47-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] as well as for the formation of Chia oil-loaded microparticles [
 <xref rid="B51-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].
