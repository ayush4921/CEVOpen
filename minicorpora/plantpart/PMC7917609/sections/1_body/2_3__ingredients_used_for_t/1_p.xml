<p>Encapsulating materials employed for solid lipid particles preparation are selected for their biocompatibility, availability, and price. A successful application of the microencapsulation technique depends primarily on the correct choice of solid lipids with desired physicochemical and rheological properties for each specific bioactive. Many different materials can be employed in this process; however, they must be biodegradable and approved as GRAS for food applications [
 <xref rid="B35-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. They must also preserve bioactive compounds from decomposition during industrial processing and support conditions of storage. They should not interact chemically with other incorporated active agents. Several solid lipids have been used extensively. They can be divided into several categories, including waxes, vegetable oils, fatty acids, fatty alcohols, and triglycerides. 
 <xref rid="foods-10-00400-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> contains examples of materials belonging to each group.
