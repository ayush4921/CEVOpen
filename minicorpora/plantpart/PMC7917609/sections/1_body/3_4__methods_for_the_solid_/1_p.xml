<p>Different methods of microencapsulation can be used for various materials. The choice of the most suitable method depends on the type of active ingredient, its special function, and the desired application. There is no single method that can be universally applicable for the encapsulation of every food additive. Several techniques have been cited in the literature for SLM preparation [
 <xref rid="B13-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Each method has its own strengths and weaknesses in encapsulation, cost, ease of use, as well as morphology and size of formed particles. To achieve the maximum quality of the loaded microparticles, the encapsulation method must enable the formation of particles with a high loading capacity, high encapsulation efficiency, stability of encapsulate system during industrial processing and during storage, essential release features, and bioavailability of the active agent [

Among the many encapsulation techniques, several can be employed for the preparation of solid lipid microparticles. These include Spray Drying, Spray Chilling/Cooling, Extrusion, and Hot Homogenization.
