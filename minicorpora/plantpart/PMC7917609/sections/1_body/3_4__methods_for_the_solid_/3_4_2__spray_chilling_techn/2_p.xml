<p>The spray chilling procedure consists of an initial heat-melting of the lipid system at 10 °C above its melting point. The molten suspension is then transported into a feeding reservoir placed above the spray-congealing nozzle, pre-heated to 10 °C above the melting temperature of the mixture. Atomization of the molten suspension is then achieved using a wide pneumatic nozzle. The atomized molten droplets solidify in a cooling chamber at room temperature to form spherical microparticles [

SC is a promising technique to produce solid lipid microparticles loaded with various heat-sensitive bio-additives. Thus, microparticles containing Ascorbic acid (AA, Vitamin C) are successfully produced by spray chilling using stearic acid and hydrogenated vegetable fat as wall materials [
 <xref rid="B65-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. The obtained microparticles displayed characteristic spherical morphology, high polydispersity, and high encapsulation efficiency (&gt;97%) [
 <xref rid="B59-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. It was also possible to microencapsulate Ascorbic acid by spray chilling method using mixtures of two fatty acids, lauric acid and oleic acid, as a carrier lipid system. These mixtures were an exceptional lipid medium to control the release of ascorbic acid, showing potential application in food industry [

The same SC technique was used for the formation of solid lipid microparticles loaded with Ginger Oleoresin (GO); a flavor ingredient frequently used in foods. Lipid mixtures consist from palmitic acid with oleic acid or palm fat were successfully used as carriers, and as a result, high preservation of the volatile compounds of Ginger Oleoresin was accomplished [

 <xref rid="B66-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Hydrogenated vegetable oil or a wax were used as a molten carrier, creating almost perfectly spherical microparticles with a narrow size distribution. In another work, researchers evaluated the application of spray chilling technique to produce solid lipid microparticles containing Gallic acid as a model phenolic compound, using blends of soybean oil (SO) with fully hydrogenated soybean oil (FHSO) as lipid wall materials [
 <xref rid="B62-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Probiotics are another active ingredient known for being unstable at elevated temperatures, therefore, using spray chilling process microparticles can be obtained with a survive of larger number of microbes [
 <xref rid="B67-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. In a recent study, probiotic microorganisms, Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA) and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. Lactis (BL), have been encapsulated in solid lipid microparticles consisting from vegetable fat as a lipid carrier with a melting point of 51 °C. Results showed that spray chilling technique created a dry powder composed of smooth and continuous spheres and the microencapsulated probiotics presented viability at least of 90 days in savory cereal bars [
