<p>In contrast, the spray chilling/coagulating/cooling (SC) method is based on the atomization of a hot mixture of the active material and lipid carrier in a cold chamber, in which small hot droplets solidify in contact with the cool air to form solid lipid microparticles (SLM) [

In addition, in this method the solid lipid microparticles (SLM) are produced in milder temperatures, leading to a reduction in the degradation of sensitive compounds. The microparticles produced by spray chilling technique are dense and display a spherical shape (
