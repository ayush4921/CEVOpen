<p>Hot-melt extrusion technique was successfully used for preparation of powdered Quercetin-loaded solid lipid microparticles composed from carnauba wax, shellac, and zein [
 <xref rid="B42-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Physical mixtures were manually fed into a preheated twin-screw melt extruder. The extrusion was conducted continuously at a screw rotation speed of 100 rpm without use of a die. The resulting powders showed meaningfully reduced dissolution in the simulated salivary medium (pH 6.8), which can indicate that achieved efficiency of taste-masking was good. This process is especially suited for encapsulation of highly sensitive citrus flavors as well [
