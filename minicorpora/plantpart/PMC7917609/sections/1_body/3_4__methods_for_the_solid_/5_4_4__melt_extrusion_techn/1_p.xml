<p>The earliest pioneering work using extrusion for encapsulation can be dated to the late 1950s in the flavor industry, known as melt injection [

Extrusion is a procedure that enables formation of product with uniform shape and density from a raw material by forcing it through a die under controlled temperature, product flow, and pressure conditions. In a melt extrusion process the matrix components are melted, followed by mixing them with active compounds, thus allowing a smooth lipid mixture to be obtained. The technology is well industry-compatible, whose flexible configuration allows melting, addition, mixing, and cooling of the mixture in a continuous way. The melt extrusion technique includes the following stages: (1) melting of the carrier material inside a twin-screw extruder, (2) direct addition of an active compound, (3) dispersion of the active compound into the coating material, and (4) cooling and shaping of the extrudate, thus producing particles of 0.3â€“5 mm (

Melt extrusion promises encapsulation from the economic and environmental perspectives, since it is a one pot process (formation of the wall material, dispersion of the active principle, and forming of the encapsulated material), without use of any organic solvent as well as reduced energy and water consumption.
