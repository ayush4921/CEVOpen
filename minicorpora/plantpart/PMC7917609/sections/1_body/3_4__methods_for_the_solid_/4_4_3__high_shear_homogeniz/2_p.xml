<p>The hot homogenization technique has been used for production of solid lipid microparticles containing tristearin and babacu oil as the carrier and denatured whey protein isolate (WPI) as a surfactant [

The research evaluated the ability of proposed lipid system to protect Quercetin, a flavonoid known for antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties against degradation. The solid lipid microparticles were produced by melting the lipid phase at 70 °C and then adding the Quercetin. The hot WPI dispersion solution was mixed with the melted lipid followed by ultra-agitation at 12,000 rpm for 5 min. Results showed that the formed microparticles efficiently protected the Quercetin from oxidation, and 85% of the initial amount of the flavonoid was remained after 30 days. A high-shear homogenization method was also used to produce β-carotene-loaded solid lipid microparticles [

These SLM were prepared by dispersing the aqueous phase (containing hydrolysed soy protein isolate, HSPI) in the palm stearin with ultra-agitation at 15,000 rpm. The same technique was implemented for encapsulation of essential fatty acids. Hot homogenization was a suitable technique in view of the natural similarity and compatibility between polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and the solid lipid carrier. Chia oil-loaded solid lipid microparticles were obtained by hot homogenization, using stearic acid as a lipid carrier and Tween 80 as a surfactant at 75 °C [
