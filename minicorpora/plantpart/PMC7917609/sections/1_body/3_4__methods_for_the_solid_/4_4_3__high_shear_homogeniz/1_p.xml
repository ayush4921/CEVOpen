<p>High-shear homogenization is a simple method in which at a first step lipid is melted above its melting point, followed by addition of poorly water-soluble active agent. At the same time, an aqueous emulsifier solution is heated at the same temperature. In the second step, both materials are mixed and stirred at high-speed using high-shear homogenizer with continuing heating. Solid lipid particles are formed upon cooling of the molten mixture (

A lesser quantity of emulsifier is required in this process in comparison to the microemulsion technique. Another advantage of high-shear homogenization technique is that lab-scale and large-scale production can also be readily accomplished [
