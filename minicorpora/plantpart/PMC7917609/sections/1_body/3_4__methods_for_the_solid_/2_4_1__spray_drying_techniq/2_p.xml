<p>SD can be used to encapsulate different food ingredients, e.g., omega-3 oils, enzymes, bioactive peptides, molecules, probiotics, phenolic compound, antioxidants, antimicrobial agents, vitamins, natural food colorants, flavors, and essential oils [

Microencapsulation of flavor and the addition of the microcapsules to coffee beverages was efficient to prolong flavor retention and improve beverage quality. In a different study, water-dispersible microcapsules containing natural colors such as Anthocyanin and Norbixin were encapsulated into a two-layer shell using a SD technique [

An inner, solid lipid layer consisted of glycerol mono-oleate (GMO) and soy lecithin, and an outer, water-dispersible system consisted of maltodextrin and poloxamer 338. Anthocyanin- and Norbixin-loaded microcapsules were designed and produced to protect the heat-sensitive colorants from thermal degradation during industrial processing. SD is one of the most commonly used commercial methods for microencapsulation of omega-3 fatty acids as well [
