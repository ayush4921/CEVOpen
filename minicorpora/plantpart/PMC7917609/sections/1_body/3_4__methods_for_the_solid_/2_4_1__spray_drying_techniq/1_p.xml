<p>Spray drying (SD) is the oldest and most widely used microencapsulation method in the food industry [
 <xref rid="B52-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. SD is flexible and cost-effective, allowing continuous production. It can be easily industrialized in terms of equipment and materials that have a low cost compared to other techniques. SD produces high quality microparticles by atomizing a hot liquid oil mixture or emulsion through a nozzle into a hot gas chamber, thus producing a particles powder. The spray-drying process has three steps: (i) Preparation of the dispersion or emulsion containing the active material, (ii) homogenization of the dispersion, and (iii) atomization of the resultant mixture into the drying chamber (

Despite the high temperatures generally used in this process (~180 °C), the core temperature remains below 40 °C because of the short time exposition and rapid evaporation of water. SD usually produces hollow, low-density particles with an irregular geometry. The size of the obtained microparticles can vary from 10–50 µm at the fine end to 2–3 mm at the large end (
