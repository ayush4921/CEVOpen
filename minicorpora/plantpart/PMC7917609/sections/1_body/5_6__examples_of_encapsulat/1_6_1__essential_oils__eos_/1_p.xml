<p>Essential oils (EOs) are mixtures of natural volatile bioactive compounds produced by plants. Given their aroma, they are often used as flavors in the food industry. In addition, they have antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral activities, also favoring their wide use as food preservatives in the food and feed industries [

 <xref rid="B79-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Since synthetic chemical preservatives in food can be harmful to human health, EOs can offer better alternatives. However, the effective application of essential oils as natural preservatives and flavors in the food industry may be limited due to their volatile character as well as their reactivity and hydrophobicity. Thus, their incorporation into water-based foodstuffs requires encapsulation of EOs inside an appropriate matrix [

Thus, microparticles with different essential oil concentrations were produced by dispersing them within a hydrogenated vegetable fat matrix [
