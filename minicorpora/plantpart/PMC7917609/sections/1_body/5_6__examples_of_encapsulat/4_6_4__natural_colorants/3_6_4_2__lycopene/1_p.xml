<p>Lycopene is a natural pigment found widely in plants, which belongs to lipophilic isoprene family. It possesses varied bioactivity against cardiovascular diseases, eye diseases, nerval degenerative disease, and cancers. Lycopene is sensitive not only to possible industrial processing conditions, but also to oxidative degradation and cis-trans isomerization that can occur due to its 11 conjugated double bonds and multiple unsaturated olefin structures [

As a result of its low water-solubility and instability under gastrointestinal conditions, lycopene has low bioavailability, thus limiting its application in foods and health care products. The United Nations Food &amp; Agriculture Organization, the Food Additives Committee, and the World Health Organization have recognized lycopene as a Class A nutrient. Developing effective methods to enhance the bioavailability of lycopene has become a popular research goal. Researchers are striving to develop different lycopene delivery systems [

One of these methods includes utilization of great solubility of lycopene in lipophilic solvents such as edible fats and oils and in the formation of solid lipid microparticles. In one study, solid lipid microparticles loaded with lycopene dissolved in sunflower oil solution have been produced from shortening, soy, and palm oils as the carrier [
