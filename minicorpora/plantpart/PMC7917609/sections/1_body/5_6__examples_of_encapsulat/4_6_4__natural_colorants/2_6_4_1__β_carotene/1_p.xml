<p>β-carotene (BC) is a red-orange pigment found in significant levels in various fruits and vegetables. It is considered to be a promising functional food ingredient and is used in food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical applications as a natural pigment with nutraceutical values. However, the application of β-carotene is limited due to low water solubility and high chemical instability. Its high lipophilicity also decreases its bioavailability during digestion [

For example, solid lipid microparticle dispersions containing β-carotene and produced from palm stearin as the lipid phase have been combined with yogurts in an amount of 5%

In contrast, the addition of pure BC to the yogurts was not possible, since the hydrophobic nature of β-carotene prevented adequate mixing with the product.
