<p>Anthocyanin is a natural, water-soluble flavonoid extracted from the red and blue parts of plants such as red cabbage leaves, berries, and black carrots. It is one of the most frequently used pigments due to its exciting color. Norbixin is another water-soluble natural colorant extracted from the pericarp of Bixa orellana L. shrub seeds [

Both Anthocyanin and Norbixin are highly subjected to thermal and photo-degradation, resulting in the formation of different effects and leading to a color change. Several methods have been developed to improve the stability of natural pigments in order to expand their potential applications in the food industry. Amongst these, solid lipid encapsulation has received much attention, since it can provide an effective physical barrier to protect natural colors from degradation. Solid lipid microparticles containing these heat-sensitive natural colorants were produced by assembling a core-shell structure with a shell including a glycerol mono-oleate (GMO) as a solid lipid shell, a water-dispersible polysaccharide layer, and an aqueous core housing [
