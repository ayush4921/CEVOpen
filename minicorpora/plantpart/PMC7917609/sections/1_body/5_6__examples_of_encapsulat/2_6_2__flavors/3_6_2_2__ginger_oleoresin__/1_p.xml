<p>Ginger oleoresin (GO) is often used as a flavoring additive in foods. As a result of high viscosity and volatility of its natural liquid form, commercial Ginger oleoresin may cause some problems in handling during production. For example, some of its compounds may be decomposed or volatilized if exposed to heat and light during industrial processing or storage. Encapsulation techniques can be applied to reduce these difficulties, using food grade materials to protect and hold oleoresin. Thus, the spray chilling microencapsulation technique was used for the incorporation of GO into solid lipid microparticles (SLM) formed from mixtures of palmitic acid and oleic acid or palm fat serving as lipid matrixes [
