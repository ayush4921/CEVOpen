<p>Usually, consumers prefer their coffee based on its flavor. Coffee taste and smell involves several chemicals specific for the coffee bean roasting process. During prolonged storage, the coffee flavor can undergo several changes, amongst them loss of most volatile compounds, reactions between coffee components, and oxidation [

Thus, there is a need to maintain coffee flavor for as long as possible to retain the quality of coffee beverages during its shelf-life. Microencapsulation of coffee flavor can protect flavor compounds from unwelcome chemical changes and may retain flavor mixture during industrial process or storage. A recent study concentrated on retention of the coffee flavor in a coffee-containing milk drinks by their microencapsulation using medium-chain triglyceride and maltodextrin as primary and secondary coating materials [
