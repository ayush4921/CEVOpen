<p>Quercetin is a flavonoid that originated from a plant, which possess excellent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer properties [
 <xref rid="B42-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. However, due to its high lipophilicity, Quercetin has neglectable absorption in the gastrointestinal tract, leading to very low oral bioavailability: Less than 17% in rats and less than 1% in humans [
 <xref rid="B29-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Besides its poor dissolution rate, it has a bitter taste that can pose a challenge for further development. Microencapsulation of Quercetin was proposed as a simple and attractive technique to produce taste-masked powders [
 <xref rid="B42-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The obtained microparticles showed extended dissolution rates, indicating a potential for taste-masking. In other study, Quercetin-loaded solid lipid microparticles were prepared in order to protect Quercetin [
