<p>Guaraná is a native fruit of the Amazon rainforest. Guaraná seeds are rich in polyphenols, such as catechins and epicatechins that possess a high antioxidant activity. Recently it has been shown [
 <xref rid="B84-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>] that compounds found in commercial guaraná powder decrease oxidative stress markers in healthy subjects. As a result of their poor bioavailability and fast degradation under gastrointestinal conditions, it is difficult to preserve valuable properties of polyphenols [
 <xref rid="B85-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. The microencapsulation of guaraná seed extract (GSE) in solid lipid microparticles was achieved using a spray chilling method and vegetable fat as a carrier [
 <xref rid="B40-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Microencapsulation was designed to protect the GSE during processing and storage as well as for controlling its release into the intestine. As a result of incorporation of guaraná seed extract in solid particles, its phenolic compounds remained relatively stable (at least 75% were detected after 90 days at 25 °C) and were released almost totally at simulated gastrointestinal media.
