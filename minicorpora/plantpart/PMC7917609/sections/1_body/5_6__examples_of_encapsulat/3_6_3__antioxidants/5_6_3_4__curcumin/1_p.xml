<p>Curcumin is a hydrophobic polyphenol obtained from the rhizomes of Curcuma longa. It has a strong yellow color and an extensive variety of beneficial biological properties, such as anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, anti-microbial, and neuro-protective. Owing to these outstanding features and low toxicity, curcumin is an appreciated component used by the food industry as a natural yellow pigment instead of artificial colorants. Despite these features, application of this additive has been partial because of its high hydrophobicity, poor absorption, high sensitivity to light, and spicy flavor [

In one study, Curcumin was incorporated into SLM formed from Babacu oil and Tristearin. The feasibility of producing low-sugar mango jams enriched with these curcumin-loaded lipid microparticles was examined [
