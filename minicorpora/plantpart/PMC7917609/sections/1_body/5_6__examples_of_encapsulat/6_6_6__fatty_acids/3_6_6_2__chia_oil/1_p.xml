<p>Chia (
 <italic>Salvia hispanica</italic> L.) oil has a high nutritional value, since it contains triglycerides with PUFA acids present in large proportions and an omega-3 content between 60% and 68%. PUFA are susceptible to oxidation that can lead to decreased nutritional and sensory quality. Chia oil was extracted and successfully encapsulated in stearic acid microparticles by hot homogenization method [
