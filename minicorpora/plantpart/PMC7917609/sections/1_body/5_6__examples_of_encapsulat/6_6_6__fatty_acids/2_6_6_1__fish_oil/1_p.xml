<p>Fish oil is one of the main sources of EPA and DHA fatty acids essential for our central nervous system functions. Incorporation of fish oil into foods is challenging due to the low solubility of fish oil in aqueous food systems and its high susceptibility to oxidative deterioration during food processing and storage, thereby limiting their use in food products. Foods can be enriched with omega-3 rich oils using encapsulation techniques in order to improve consumption of omega-3 fatty acids. Microencapsulation of omega-3 oils can minimize oxidative decomposition, convert them from viscous liquid into easy-to-handle powder form, and extend shelf-life. Microencapsulation technology can offer practical solutions for the stabilization and improved delivery of omega-3 fatty acids in foods [

Recent study was concentrated on encapsulation of fish oil in hollow solid lipid particles formed from fully hydrogenated soybean oil (FHSO). These fish oil-loaded spherical solid lipid particles significantly improved the oxidative stability of the encapsulated fish oil compared to the free fish oil.
