<p>Probiotics are live microorganisms that may improve public health by offering several benefits if consumed regularly in satisfactory amounts [
 <xref rid="B36-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The demand for probiotic foods has increased as a result of consumer concerns about their food and health. The minimum recommended levels of probiotics in food have to be at least 106 cfu/g. Use of probiotic microorganisms in foods, however, has been partial due to the difficulty of preserving their viability during industrial processing and product shelf life. A recent study was initiated to evaluate the viability of Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA) and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (BL) encapsulated in SLM using spray chilling, followed by adding them to savory cereal bars [

Encapsulated probiotics were more viable than lyophilized microorganisms, as expected, since the microorganisms inside the lipid carrier were protected from the presence of oxygen, water, and oxidative stress. Cereal bars with and without probiotics did not exhibit sensory differences, indicating that the inclusion of microorganisms encapsulated in solid lipid microparticles did not affect product sensory characteristics. The microencapsulation of probiotics provided a protective wall against the severe conditions of the gastrointestinal tract, such as low pH and the presence of enzymes and bile salts [
