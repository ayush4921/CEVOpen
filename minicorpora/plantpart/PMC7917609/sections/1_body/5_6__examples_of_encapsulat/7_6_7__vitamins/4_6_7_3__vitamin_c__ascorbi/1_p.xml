<p>Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid and ascorbate, originates from various foods and is sold as a common dietary supplement. Vitamin C is a crucial nutrient for the repair of tissues and the enzymatic formation of certain neurotransmitters. Vitamin C is essential for the functioning of several enzymes and is significant for the proper functioning of immune system. Ascorbic acid (AA) has been broadly used in the food industry for two different purposes—as an antioxidant additive, and as a source of Vitamin C in the diet [

Environmental influences, such as high pH, heat, oxygen, and UV rays, may affect its stability, thus weakening its nutrient value during the industrial production and prolonged storage of products. Ascorbic acid encapsulation may not only reduce its degradation, but it may also prevent contact with other components of the food matrix. In addition, it may also mask the special unpleasant acid taste of ascorbic acid. Several studies reported the use of spray chilling method for production of solid lipid microparticles containing ascorbic acid, using different lipids as wall materials, including fully hydrogenated palm oil and vegetable glycerol monostearate [
