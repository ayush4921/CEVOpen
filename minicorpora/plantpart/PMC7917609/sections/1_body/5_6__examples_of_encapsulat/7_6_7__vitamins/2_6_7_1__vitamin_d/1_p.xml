It is now common to consume supplements containing vitamin D, even though the actual available value of this vitamin is often limited by poor water solubility, rapid degradation, and low absorption, leading to low bioavailability. Researchers have concentrated on various techniques such as direct addition, emulsification, and microencapsulation to confront these problems. Since Vitamin D is a highly lipophilic compound, its incorporation into lipid particles is straightforward. In recent research, solid lipid microparticles loaded with 0.1% of vitamin D3 were produced by spray chilling method using vegetable fat as lipid carrier. In some formulations 1% beeswax and 1% soy lecithin were added as well in order to evaluate their influence on vitamin stability [
