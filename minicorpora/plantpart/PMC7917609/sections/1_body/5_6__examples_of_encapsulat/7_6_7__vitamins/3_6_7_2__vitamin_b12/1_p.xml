<p>Vitamin B12 is produced only by some organisms. This vitamin is highly essential for red blood cell production and central nervous system (CNS) functions. Since Vitamin B12 occurs only in few foods and in restricted quantities, a sufficient supplement of Vitamin B12 is extremely important. The U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) determines the daily value for vitamin B12 to be at 2.4 mg. As Vitamin B12 is a highly sensitive compound, it can be easily decomposed when in contact with light, acid or basic environment, oxidizing agents, and prolonged heating [

Vitamin B12-loaded SLM can be simply added to dark chocolate, peanut butter, or yogurts. It is known that the vegetarian or vegan population is mostly affected by the Vitamin B12 deficiency, therefore plant-derived foods can be considered as the best choice for lipid particles incorporation [
 <xref rid="B50-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In a recent study, solid lipid microparticles loaded with Vitamin B12 were obtained by spray chilling technique using vegetable fat as the carrier. The results indicated that encapsulation provided increased protection of Vitamin B12 (&gt;91.1% for all formulations after 120 days of storage) compared to the free vitamin (75.2%).
