<p>‘Vitamins’ are defined as a group of micronutrients that cannot be synthesized by the human body. These compounds are classified into fat-soluble (A, D, E, and K) and water-soluble vitamins (B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B7, B9, B12, and C) [

Vitamins play vital roles in our health due to their specific functions to regulate metabolic and cellular functions, promote health, reproduction and growth, and prevent disease. Vitamin deficiency can lead to severe diseases, such as scurvy, beriberi, and night blindness as well as neurological disorders. The stability of many vitamins is influenced by environmental impacts such as light, temperature, pH, humidity, and oxygen during food processing and storage. These factors usually lead to lose of the nutrient qualities of vitamins in final products, therefore encouraging food industries to develop new methods to prevent these losses by protecting vitamins in production and storage stages. Modern technology, such as microencapsulation, can offer the desired protection. One microencapsulation method is encapsulation in solid lipid particles. Examples of encapsulations of three different vitamins are presented below.
