<p>There is no consensus in professional literature defining “encapsulation efficiency”, leading to different equations and methods, therefore making comparisons difficult. Generally, Encapsulation (Incorporation) Efficiency (EE) is defined as the ratio between the quantity of encapsulated material (core material) measured in SLM and the real value used to prepare the particles. The quantity of incorporated additives can be determined using HPLC or UV techniques. Usually, to measure this amount, solid microparticles should first be totally dissolved in an appropriate solvent, following by filtration, and evaluation by the chosen technique. Since a total amount of active ingredient is usually calculated in this way, to evaluate the actual encapsulated amount, a superficial amount should also be measured, then subtracted from the total amount. Efficiency of encapsulation is mostly dependent on interactions between the encapsulant (carrier, solid lipid) and encapsulated compounds (core, food additive), as well as on the encapsulation technique used [

The TE of the resulting microparticles was defined as the ratio between the total amount of ascorbic acid (AAT) in the sample and the initial amount of ascorbic acid added to the emulsion (AA0) (TE% = AAt/AA0*100). The superficial ascorbic acid (SAA) amount was determined by suspending the particles in a Polysorbate 80 solution. EE was calculated by subtracting the amount of SAA in the AAT in the sample. The ratio was expressed as a percentage representing the EE value: EE (%) = [(AAT-SAA)/AA0] × 100. Encapsulation Efficiency (EE) analyses of SLM containing Vitamin-B12 were evaluated by quantification of amount of Vitamin-B12 in the microparticles using HPLC method [
 <xref rid="B50-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The EE was determined by similar equation: EE(%) = (TVC–CVF)/VCA) × 100%, where TVC is total Vitamin-B12, CVF is a superficial Vitamin-B12 and VCA corresponds to the amount of vitamins added during particles formation. The EE of solid particles bearing Gallic acid was also expressed as the difference between total and superficial gallic acid concentrations in relation to the amount of gallic acid added [
 <xref rid="B62-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. The gallic acid content of microparticles was quantified after particle dissolution in chloroform and extraction in the aqueous phase using the Foline-Ciocalteau colorimetric method, reading absorbance at 765 nm in a spectrophotometer. The amount of natural colorants Anthocyanin and Norbixin in spray-dried microcapsules was evaluated first by measuring the non-encapsulated color in the supernatant [

Then the pellet was dispersed in ethanol to quantify the total amount of color in the microcapsules, and the encapsulated color was measured using UV-Vis spectrophotometry. The color encapsulation efficiency (EE%) was calculated using the same equation. The actual Essential Oil (EO) amount in the microparticles was determined with gas chromatograph equipped with FID detector [
 <xref rid="B66-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. After determining the essential oil concentration in the microparticles and the theoretically expected essential oil concentration, the encapsulation efficiency was calculated using the following formula: EE% = ([EO in particles]/EO theoretical]) × 100.
