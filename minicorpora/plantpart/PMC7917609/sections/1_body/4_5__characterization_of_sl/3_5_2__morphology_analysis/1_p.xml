<p>Morphological analysis of the obtained microparticles is usually performed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), enabling close visualization of the particle surface. Thus, Ascorbic acid (AA)-loaded solid lipid microparticles were visualized by SEM as spheres, characteristic for microparticles prepared by spray congealing method [

Using SEM technology, images of particles containing Vitamin-B12 revealed a smooth and continuous surface, typical for SLM obtained by the spray chilling method [

SEM images of the microparticles prepared from vegetable fat made with partially hydrogenate cotton seed oil and loaded with soy protein hydrolysate (HP) exhibited spherical shapes and smooth surfaces, with varying diameters and agglomerated material [
