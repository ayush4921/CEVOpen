<p>Stability evaluation experiments are necessary in order to predict the behavior of the SLM and of active ingredient during extended storage. For example, the stability of the microencapsulated Ascorbic acid (AA) was evaluated on samples kept at 24 °C and 37 °C for 56 days [
 <xref rid="B60-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Overall results showed that at least 70% of the initial AA was stable after 56 days. The stability of SLM loaded with proanthocyanidin-rich cinnamon extract (PRCE) was evaluated under storage conditions at 5 °C, 25 °C and 37 °C for up to 90 days [

The stability of Vitamin D3 incorporated into SLM was compared with free vitamin D3 during storage at 10 °C and 25 °C in closed vials in the dark for up to 65 days [
 <xref rid="B37-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The results showed that SLM managed to preserve 71.8–86.3% of initial Vitamin D3 after 65 days of storage at room temperature, compared to 60.8% of free vitamin. In another study, the Anthocyanin and Norbixin content of the spray-dried microcapsules was evaluated at room temperature in the dark during one-month storage [
 <xref rid="B57-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The natural color of microcapsules decreased sharply over time, as a result decomposition of natural colorants in contact with moisture present in produced powder at ambient temperatures. However, the encapsulation of Anthocyanin in microcapsules improved its stability against degradation compared to free Anthocyanin. In contrast, Norbixin-loaded microcapsules showed high retention without a significant reduction.
