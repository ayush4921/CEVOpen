<p>The size of the microparticles is a significant parameter in selecting application in foods, because it may cause undesirable sensory changes in products. It may also have a negative outcome on food texture and lead to product disqualification by the customers. Therefore, microparticle size should be &lt;100 μm, not to harm food sensation [

Thus, the average hydrodynamic diameter of the Quercetin-loaded lipid microparticles produced from Babacu oil and denatured WPI was obtained by using photon correlation spectroscopy with a ZetaPlus instrument at 25 °C [
 <xref rid="B29-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Particle size distribution as well as medium diameter (by volume) of solid lipid microparticles containing Vitamin B12 were determined by using a diffraction particle size analyzer (SALD 201 V) [
 <xref rid="B50-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The same instrument was used for determination of particle size and size distribution of solid lipid microparticles loaded with Ascorbic acid (AA) [
 <xref rid="B60-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. To prevent clotting, microparticles were suspended in a Tween 80 aqueous solution (1% w/w) and stabilized for 5 min before analysis. Another useful method for the evaluation of microparticle size is laser diffraction. This technique was applied for particle size analysis of microparticles containing different concentrations of essential oils (EO) using Beckman LS 13320 instrument equipped with a universal liquid module and 2-propanol as dispersant [
 <xref rid="B66-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Size distribution and mean volumetric diameter of the SLM encapsulating Ginger Oleoresin were determined by light scattering using laser diffraction in a Mastersizer 2000 [
 <xref rid="B43-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. A similar instrument, Mastersizer S, measured SLM size distribution of solid lipid particles containing Ascorbic acid [
 <xref rid="B45-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. An alternative method to measure solid lipid particle size and size distribution is evaluation by sieve analysis, using a vibrating shaker and four standard sieves of 100, 150, 250, and 500 μm [
