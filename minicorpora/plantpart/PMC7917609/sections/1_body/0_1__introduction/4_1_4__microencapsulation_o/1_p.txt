0: Guidelines for food additives are more severe than for pharmaceuticals.
1: Many carrier materials are not generally recognized as safe (GRAS) and have not been certified for food applications [ 6].
2: Therefore, natural materials were used mostly for encapsulation in the food industry.
3: Polysaccharides are the most broadly used natural polymers in food applications.
4: These natural carbohydrate polymers originate from different sources, e.g., plants, animals, algae, and microbes.
5: Starch is one of the most abundant polysaccharides in plants.
6: Frequently used starches and its derivatives include amylose, amylopectin, dextrins, cyclodextrines, maltodextrins, syrups, polydextrose, and cellulose.
7: Another group of natural polysaccharides enjoying wide food applications is gums, due to their exceptional functionalities, non-toxicity, biodegradability, biocompatibility, and safety for human nutrition.
8: Gums possess an excellent ability to incorporate flavors, nutraceutical compounds, phenolic compounds, and antioxidants.
9: Other polysaccharides utilized for encapsulation are carrageenans and alginates (from marine sources), dextran, chitosan, xanthan, and gellan (from microbial and animal sources).
10: Proteins are also suitable for encapsulation since they are GRAS materials as well as they possess high nutritional values [ 17].
11: Proteins are found to be an effective vehicle for bioactive compounds, fats, oils, fatty acids, and flavors The most frequently used animal proteins in encapsulation are casein, gelatin, collagen, whey protein, while plant-derived proteins are soy protein, zein, and gliadin.
