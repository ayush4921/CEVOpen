<p>Food additives can be categorized [
 <xref rid="B3-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] as preservatives, nutritional additives, flavoring agents, coloring agents, etc. Some can belong to more than one category. 
 <italic>Food preservatives</italic> are compounds with antioxidant or antimicrobial properties. Antioxidants supplements allow to delay or prevent decomposition of foods due to oxidation during industrial processing, packaging, or storing. Compounds for this purpose include, among others, Ascorbic acid (AA) as an oxygen scavenger, and Butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) or Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) as free radical scavengers. Antimicrobial agents such as benzoic acid, natamycin, nitrates, sorbic acid, parabens, and others inhibit growth of bacteria or other microorganisms in foods. 
 <italic>Nutritional additives</italic> are usually added to enrich various foods with dietary supplements [
 <xref rid="B4-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. For example, vitamins are added to many foods to rise their nutritional value. For example, Vitamin A and D supplements can be added to dairy and cereal products. Vitamins B are added to flour, pasta, cereals, and baked goods. Vitamin C is added to fruit beverages, cereals, and dairy products. Probiotics, as well, are an example of an additive commonly added to dairy products to enrich the gastrointestinal flora with essential microbes. Fatty acids, minerals, and dietary fibers are other examples of nutritional additives used to enrich food products. Various texturizing agents are added during food production to supply the desired consistency of a product. Our perception of product quality is often heavily influenced by its color. Therefore, 
 <italic>colorants</italic> are added to create a standard product with an attractive color. These coloring agents can be divided into two categories: natural or synthetic. Natural colorants can originate from plants (e.g., strawberry (red), grape (blue), paprika (red/orange)), from animal or mineral sources, while artificial food colorants are usually petroleum-based chemical compounds (e.g., Brilliant Blue FCF, Indigotine, Fast Green FCF, Allura Red AC, Erythrosine, and Tartrazine). The largest group of food additives, with more than 1200 different compounds that can create flavor or replenish flavors lost or diminished in processing is 
 <italic>Flavoring agents</italic>. They can be only one chemical or a mixture of several chemicals drawn from natural or synthetic sources.
