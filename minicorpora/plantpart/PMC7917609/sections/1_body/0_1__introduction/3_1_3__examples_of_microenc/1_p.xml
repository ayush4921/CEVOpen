<p>Microencapsulation is a process in which small particles or droplets of a core material are coated or embedded into a homogeneous or heterogeneous matrix to create small capsules. Microcapsules are extremely small (1–1000 µm) and can have numerous morphologies. Food microcapsules, in particular, are small particles containing an active food additive (core) surrounded by a coating or shell. The shell material can comprise a variety of food grade polymers, carbohydrates, fats, and waxes that function as a barrier between the bioactives and the surrounding environment. Encapsulation of flavors, lipids, and carotenoids among other ingredients had recently attracted much attention by food industry [

Microencapsulated fish oil (an oil rich in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids) powder with hidden taste and prolonged shelf life has been successfully manufactured and introduced into numerous food products. Lycopene, a molecule believed to decrease the risk of prostate cancer, has been successfully microencapsulated using a carrier consisting of gelatin and sucrose [

Taste-masked microcapsules containing caffeine for food and sports nutrition industries have been produced for gels or chews to avoid typical unpleasant taste [
