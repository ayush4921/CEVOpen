0: For health concerns the food industry avails itself of increasingly more natural substances as food bio-additives.
1: Due to processing and gastrointestinal conditions, there is a growing demand to initiate new processes and technologies suitable for their protection [ 5], since these materials are commonly recognized as highly sensitive to the environment, like heat, light, oxygen, and moisture.
2: One proposed tool that can ensure improved bioavailability, stability, and delivery of these materials is microencapsulation [ 6], that can potentially prevent interaction with the food matrix and convert the applied ingredients into the easily handled, free-flowing, and dispersible powders.
3: Taste masking is another aim of encapsulation.
4: Essential fatty acids, for example, are highly valuable for health, however they have an unpleasant taste that can become a negative factor when overgoing oxidation process.
5: This problem can be avoided by encapsulation in suitable vehicles.
6: Pre-cooked food, for example, represents a large part of our consumption.
7: Recomposed powders, long-term storage period, and the need for innovation have deeply changed the management of the products [ 7].
8: As mentioned previously, microencapsulation offers sustained and controlled release that can be prompted by different factors such as dissolution, temperature, pressure, pH, and enzymes, depending on wall material [ 8].
9: The global food encapsulation market was estimated to account for US $9.9 billion in 2020 and is projected to surpass US $14 billion by 2025, ( Figure 1) [ 9].
10: This market is mainly driven by the rising request for encapsulated flavor and colorants.
11: High demand for fortified and functional foods among consumers has caused a rise in demand for food additive encapsulation.
12: Manufactures, therefore, have been adopting this technology at a high rate.
