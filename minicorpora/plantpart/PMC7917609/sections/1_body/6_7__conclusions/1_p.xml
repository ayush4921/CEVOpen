<p>Lipid based particulate systems have been used for the delivery of active agents in various fields, mostly for the delivery of pharmaceuticals. Entrapment of a drug in a lipid particle is intended to protect it from the environment, aqueous formulation or body fluids. Entrapment also allows a gradual exposure of the active agent to the delivery site or improve its physical properties towards crossing biological membranes. The use of lipid particulates in foods plays similar rolesâ€”protection and stabilization of actives, extended release, and improve activity. Lipid-based formulations use natural and edible ingredients that make them more accessible to foods than polymeric delivery technologies. With the increase interest in food quality and expansion of food technology, lipid particulate formulations are projected to grow exponentially.</p>
