Use of these compounds in food matrices has several limitations. Most of the food bio-additives are sensitive compounds that may quickly decompose in both food and within the gastrointestinal tract. Since most of these bioactives are highly or partially lipophilic molecules, they possess very low water solubility and insufficient dispersibility, leading to poor bioavailability. Thus, various methods of microencapsulation of large number of food bioactives have been studied. For encapsulation of hydrophobic compounds several lipid carriers and lipid platforms have been studied, including emulsions, microemulsions, micelles, liposomes, and lipid nano- and microparticles. Solid lipid particles (SLP) are a promising delivery system, can both deliver bioactive compounds, reduce their degradation, and permit slow and sustained release. Solid lipid particles have important advantages compared to other polymer carriers in light of their simple production technology, including scale up ability, higher loading capacity, extremely high biocompatibility, and usually low cost. This delivery system provides improved stability, solubility in various matrixes, bioavailability, and targeting properties. This article reviews recent studies on microencapsulation of selected bioactive food ingredients in solid lipid-based carriers from a point of view of production methods, characteristics of obtained particles, loading capability, stability, and release profile.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>solid lipid microparticles</kwd><kwd>lipid carriers</kwd><kwd>food bioactives</kwd><kwd>microencapsulation</kwd><kwd>bioavailability</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-foods-10-00400"><title>1. Introduction</title><sec id="sec1dot1-foods-10-00400"><title>1.1. Food Additives</title><p>Food additives are substances incorporated in foods to improve production, processing, storage or packaging, to increase or maintain nutritional values, to maintain or improve safety, freshness, and taste, as well as texture and appearance [<xref rid="B1-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Production and use of new additives decidedly multiplied during the 20th century because of the increased number of industrial foods. Almost all newly invented products, such as snacks, low-calorie, and ready-to-eat foods could not have been possible without food additives. There is also a growing demand for the incorporation of active nutritional ingredients in food for health reasons, as depicted in following table (<xref rid="foods-10-00400-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Food additives can be categorized [<xref rid="B3-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] as preservatives, nutritional additives, flavoring agents, coloring agents, etc. Some can belong to more than one category. <italic>Food preservatives</italic> are compounds with antioxidant or antimicrobial properties. Antioxidants supplements allow to delay or prevent decomposition of foods due to oxidation during industrial processing, packaging, or storing. Compounds for this purpose include, among others, Ascorbic acid (AA) as an oxygen scavenger, and Butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) or Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) as free radical scavengers. Antimicrobial agents such as benzoic acid, natamycin, nitrates, sorbic acid, parabens, and others inhibit growth of bacteria or other microorganisms in foods. <italic>Nutritional additives</italic> are usually added to enrich various foods with dietary supplements [<xref rid="B4-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. For example, vitamins are added to many foods to rise their nutritional value. For example, Vitamin A and D supplements can be added to dairy and cereal products. Vitamins B are added to flour, pasta, cereals, and baked goods. Vitamin C is added to fruit beverages, cereals, and dairy products. Probiotics, as well, are an example of an additive commonly added to dairy products to enrich the gastrointestinal flora with essential microbes. Fatty acids, minerals, and dietary fibers are other examples of nutritional additives used to enrich food products. Various texturizing agents are added during food production to supply the desired consistency of a product. Our perception of product quality is often heavily influenced by its color. Therefore, <italic>colorants</italic> are added to create a standard product with an attractive color. These coloring agents can be divided into two categories: natural or synthetic. Natural colorants can originate from plants (e.g., strawberry (red), grape (blue), paprika (red/orange)), from animal or mineral sources, while artificial food colorants are usually petroleum-based chemical compounds (e.g., Brilliant Blue FCF, Indigotine, Fast Green FCF, Allura Red AC, Erythrosine, and Tartrazine). The largest group of food additives, with more than 1200 different compounds that can create flavor or replenish flavors lost or diminished in processing is <italic>Flavoring agents</italic>. They can be only one chemical or a mixture of several chemicals drawn from natural or synthetic sources.</p></sec><sec id="sec1dot2-foods-10-00400"><title>1.2. Encapsulation of Phytochemicals and Food Additives</title><p>For health concerns the food industry avails itself of increasingly more natural substances as food bio-additives. Due to processing and gastrointestinal conditions, there is a growing demand to initiate new processes and technologies suitable for their protection [<xref rid="B5-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], since these materials are commonly recognized as highly sensitive to the environment, like heat, light, oxygen, and moisture. One proposed tool that can ensure improved bioavailability, stability, and delivery of these materials is microencapsulation [<xref rid="B6-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], that can potentially prevent interaction with the food matrix and convert the applied ingredients into the easily handled, free-flowing, and dispersible powders. Taste masking is another aim of encapsulation. Essential fatty acids, for example, are highly valuable for health, however they have an unpleasant taste that can become a negative factor when overgoing oxidation process. This problem can be avoided by encapsulation in suitable vehicles. Pre-cooked food, for example, represents a large part of our consumption. Recomposed powders, long-term storage period, and the need for innovation have deeply changed the management of the products [<xref rid="B7-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. As mentioned previously, microencapsulation offers sustained and controlled release that can be prompted by different factors such as dissolution, temperature, pressure, pH, and enzymes, depending on wall material [<xref rid="B8-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The global food encapsulation market was estimated to account for US $9.9 billion in 2020 and is projected to surpass US $14 billion by 2025, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00400-f001">Figure 1</xref>) [<xref rid="B9-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This market is mainly driven by the rising request for encapsulated flavor and colorants. High demand for fortified and functional foods among consumers has caused a rise in demand for food additive encapsulation. Manufactures, therefore, have been adopting this technology at a high rate.</p></sec><sec id="sec1dot3-foods-10-00400"><title>1.3. Examples of Microencapsulation of Bioactives in Foods</title><p>Microencapsulation is a process in which small particles or droplets of a core material are coated or embedded into a homogeneous or heterogeneous matrix to create small capsules. Microcapsules are extremely small (1&#x02013;1000 &#x000b5;m) and can have numerous morphologies. Food microcapsules, in particular, are small particles containing an active food additive (core) surrounded by a coating or shell. The shell material can comprise a variety of food grade polymers, carbohydrates, fats, and waxes that function as a barrier between the bioactives and the surrounding environment. Encapsulation of flavors, lipids, and carotenoids among other ingredients had recently attracted much attention by food industry [<xref rid="B10-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. l-Menthol, for example, has been encapsulated in a carrier mixture of maltodextrin and gum Arabic. Flavors such as oregano, citronella, and marjoram have been encapsulated using skimmed milk powder and whey protein concentrate [<xref rid="B11-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Flavor-loaded microcapsules can release the active material at a perfect time to produce the maximum effect for the consumer. Microencapsulated fish oil (an oil rich in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids) powder with hidden taste and prolonged shelf life has been successfully manufactured and introduced into numerous food products. Lycopene, a molecule believed to decrease the risk of prostate cancer, has been successfully microencapsulated using a carrier consisting of gelatin and sucrose [<xref rid="B12-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Another use of microencapsulation is to reduce degradation of carotenoids in foods, thereby preventing decreased product quality in nutritional properties and coloration [<xref rid="B11-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Specific applications of microencapsulation are [<xref rid="B13-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]: baby foods, baked products, chewing gum, flavored waters, leavening agents, nutrition bars, and yogurt. Taste-masked microcapsules containing caffeine for food and sports nutrition industries have been produced for gels or chews to avoid typical unpleasant taste [<xref rid="B14-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Microencapsulation has also been used to improve water spreading and bioavailability of hydrophobic materials, such as coenzyme Q10 or carotenoids [<xref rid="B15-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec1dot4-foods-10-00400"><title>1.4. Microencapsulation of Phytochemicals and Food Additives Using Polysaccharides and Proteins</title><p>Guidelines for food additives are more severe than for pharmaceuticals. Many carrier materials are not &#x0201c;generally recognized as safe&#x0201d; (GRAS) and have not been certified for food applications [<xref rid="B6-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Therefore, natural materials were used mostly for encapsulation in the food industry. Polysaccharides are the most broadly used natural polymers in food applications. These natural carbohydrate polymers originate from different sources, e.g., plants, animals, algae, and microbes. Starch is one of the most abundant polysaccharides in plants. Frequently used starches and its derivatives include amylose, amylopectin, dextrins, cyclodextrines, maltodextrins, syrups, polydextrose, and cellulose. Another group of natural polysaccharides enjoying wide food applications is gums, due to their exceptional functionalities, non-toxicity, biodegradability, biocompatibility, and safety for human nutrition. Gums possess an excellent ability to incorporate flavors, nutraceutical compounds, phenolic compounds, and antioxidants. Other polysaccharides utilized for encapsulation are carrageenans and alginates (from marine sources), dextran, chitosan, xanthan, and gellan (from microbial and animal sources). Proteins are also suitable for encapsulation since they are GRAS materials as well as they possess high nutritional values [<xref rid="B17-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Proteins are found to be an effective vehicle for bioactive compounds, fats, oils, fatty acids, and flavors The most frequently used animal proteins in encapsulation are casein, gelatin, collagen, whey protein, while plant-derived proteins are soy protein, zein, and gliadin.</p><p>Although numerous reviews have been published concerning microencapsulation of food ingredients, we have tried to update recent developments in the <italic>solid lipid encapsulation</italic> of food bio-additives. The most recent (the last several years) research scientific original articles that develop food bioactives-loaded solid lipid microparticles are reviewed, emphasizing materials used, methods of particle preparation, particles characterization, and various examples of its applications in food industry.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2-foods-10-00400"><title>2. Solid Lipid Encapsulation</title><p>Solid lipid micro- and nanoparticles, also called Lipospheres, are drug-loaded solid lipid spheres decorated with phospholipids and surfactants, used to deliver active agents [<xref rid="B18-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Lipospheres are prepared by a melt process in which the lipid and the drug are melted and mixed with a hot buffer containing the phospholipids and surfactants, then homogenized to create a uniform emulsion. Upon rapid cooling a dispersion is formed. Alternatively, the drug, lipid, phospholipid, and surfactants can be dissolved in an organic solvent and evaporated in a large flak to form a thin film. Upon addition of a warm buffer and homogenization, a lipid suspension is obtained. Lipospheres have been prepared for extended delivery of local anesthetics, vaccines, antibiotics, insect repellent, cosmetic agents, etc. [<xref rid="B22-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. An in-situ formulation called Pro-Nanodispersion Lipospheres (PNL) spontaneously forms nanoparticles upon addition to aqueous media. PNL are designed to improve the oral bioavailability of cyclosporin and cannabinoids [<xref rid="B21-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Upon contact with GI (gastrointestinal) fluids, the oily formulation loaded into soft gelatin capsules immediately forms lipid nanoparticles of 30 nm to significantly improve the oral bioavailability of Cyslosporin [<xref rid="B21-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Similar formulations to improve oral delivery of cannabinoids are under clinical development [<xref rid="B23-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Lipospheres, PNL, or Solid Lipid Nanoparticles (SLN) have potential applications in the delivery of water insoluble active agents by different routes of administration for improved bioavailability. Many bioactive ingredients, nutrients, and other food additives, including fatty acids, vitamins, polyphenols, aromas, and preservatives are highly hydrophobic materials. Absorption into the small intestine increases when an edible lipid is added, thereby promoting solubilization and transportation of lipophilic agents [<xref rid="B28-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. For these reasons micro- and nanoparticles produced from different lipid systems as transporters have been studied extensively. The presence of lipids can instantaneously increase the dispersibility of hydrophobic additives leading to improved absorption, and thus to increased bioavailability. The difference between solid lipid particles and oil-in-water (o/w) emulsions is that their lipid carrier is composed of a solid lipid (solid at room temperature) [<xref rid="B29-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The added active materials (core) remain incorporated inside a solid lipid phase, usually stabilized by surfactant molecules [<xref rid="B30-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The solid state of Solid Lipid Microparticles (SLM) provides clear advantages over the liquid state, encouraging increasing interest in their development. Lipid microparticles can be an advantageous alternative to polymeric particles in light of several visible advantages of this delivering system. Amongst them are the facility of large-scale production, relatively low cost, and low toxicity. In addition to solubilization and better dispersion of the active ingredient, SLM can provide extended release of active agent, to mask the undesirable taste and protect against degradation inside the GI tract [<xref rid="B31-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Many lipid materials are suitable for food applications, including fatty acids and fatty alcohols, waxes, and triglycerides. Usually, the solid lipids used in the microencapsulation process have a melting point from 50&#x000b0; to 85 &#x000b0;C [<xref rid="B32-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Lipid transporters have exceptional properties that widely used in emulsification, film formation, and encapsulation of active compounds thereby providing many potential applications in the food industry [<xref rid="B33-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Polar lipids, such as biocompatible phospholipids, are good surface-active compounds suitable for the stabilization, protection, and controlled release of active compounds [<xref rid="B34-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Therefore, lipid-based encapsulation techniques can certainly offer a number of important benefits as a shield system for sensitive food bioactives.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-foods-10-00400"><title>3. Ingredients Used for the Preparation of SLM</title><p>Encapsulating materials employed for solid lipid particles preparation are selected for their biocompatibility, availability, and price. A successful application of the microencapsulation technique depends primarily on the correct choice of solid lipids with desired physicochemical and rheological properties for each specific bioactive. Many different materials can be employed in this process; however, they must be biodegradable and approved as GRAS for food applications [<xref rid="B35-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. They must also preserve bioactive compounds from decomposition during industrial processing and support conditions of storage. They should not interact chemically with other incorporated active agents. Several solid lipids have been used extensively. They can be divided into several categories, including waxes, vegetable oils, fatty acids, fatty alcohols, and triglycerides. <xref rid="foods-10-00400-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> contains examples of materials belonging to each group.</p><p>It is very important to choose the most appropriate encapsulating carrier or mixture of carriers to achieve higher retention of active material inside the particles, since composition can contribute to overall stability. For example, probiotics can be protected during the digestion process using <italic>vegetable fat</italic> as the encapsulating carrier, thereby ensuring functionality [<xref rid="B36-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. <italic>Vegetable fat</italic> has also been used to encapsulate Vitamin D3, since it has a suitable melting point (above room temperature, but not too high), which is important in avoiding decomposition of vitamin D3 during the particle formation process. Vegetable fat is also edible and commercially available. It is widely used to prepare ice cream, bread, and other food products [<xref rid="B37-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. <italic>Palm stearin</italic> lipid has been used for SLM production due to its special triglyceride composition that promotes a disorganized, less crystalline structure to prevent rejection of the encapsulated bioactives during the solidification process [<xref rid="B38-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Lipids with relatively low melting points have been studied extensively in microencapsulation; but the use of materials with high melting points is not as common. The use of high melting point lipids can be interesting for possibly increased stability compared to low melting point lipids [<xref rid="B41-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. <italic>Carnauba wax</italic>, obtained from the Brazilian carnauba palm tree, is a solid lipid material consisting of a mixture of fatty esters, fatty alcohols, and fatty acids, with a high melting temperature (82 &#x000b0;C&#x02013;86 &#x000b0;C). For example, Quercetin, a plant-derived flavonoid, was successfully microencapsulated by using carnauba wax for taste-masking [<xref rid="B42-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Lipid mixtures were used for encapsulation as well. Thus, mixtures composed of <italic>palmitic acid</italic> with <italic>oleic acid</italic> or <italic>palm fat</italic> were used as carriers for encapsulation of Ginger oleoresin, a flavor ingredient also known as an antimicrobial and antioxidant agent [<xref rid="B43-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Ginger oleoresin has been encapsulated using a lipid matrix containing a mixture of solid and liquid lipids. In this study, <italic>stearic acid</italic> was used as a solid lipid and <italic>oleic acid</italic> as a liquid lipid [<xref rid="B44-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Solid lipid microparticles containing Ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) were synthesized, as well, using mixtures of <italic>Lauric acid</italic> (LA)/<italic>Oleic acid</italic> (OA) at different ratios [<xref rid="B45-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. For the encapsulation of fish oil, <italic>fully hydrogenated soybean oil</italic> was chosen as a solid lipid, since it is inexpensive material (widely used for the preparation of candles) and stable against oxidation [<xref rid="B46-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Curcumin was encapsulated in solid lipid microparticles formed from a lipid mixture containing <italic>Babacu oil</italic> and <italic>Tristearin</italic>, followed by incorporation into low-sugar mango jam [<xref rid="B47-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>The selection of surfactants to produce solid lipid microparticles is an important factor when considering incorporation into foodstuffs, since many of the compounds usually useful for particle stabilization are not of food grade. Among the GRAS surfactants, <italic>protein concentrates</italic> and <italic>isolates</italic> are used for microencapsulation. SLM containing &#x003b2;-carotene for incorporation into yogurts and vanilla ice creams was stabilized with <italic>hydrolyzed soy protein isolate</italic> [<xref rid="B39-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B48-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].

Methods for the Solid Lipid Microparticles Preparation</title><p>Different methods of microencapsulation can be used for various materials. The choice of the most suitable method depends on the type of active ingredient, its special function, and the desired application. There is no single method that can be universally applicable for the encapsulation of every food additive. Several techniques have been cited in the literature for SLM preparation [<xref rid="B13-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Each method has its own strengths and weaknesses in encapsulation, cost, ease of use, as well as morphology and size of formed particles. To achieve the maximum quality of the loaded microparticles, the encapsulation method must enable the formation of particles with a high loading capacity, high encapsulation efficiency, stability of encapsulate system during industrial processing and during storage, essential release features, and bioavailability of the active agent [<xref rid="B13-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Encapsulation is a rapidly developing technology with strong potential in the food industry. Among the many encapsulation techniques, several can be employed for the preparation of solid lipid microparticles. These include Spray Drying, Spray Chilling/Cooling, Extrusion, and Hot Homogenization. <xref rid="foods-10-00400-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> summarizes the main principles of each method.</p><sec id="sec4dot1-foods-10-00400"><title>4.1. Spray Drying Technique</title><p>Spray drying (SD) is the oldest and most widely used microencapsulation method in the food industry [<xref rid="B52-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. SD is flexible and cost-effective, allowing continuous production. It can be easily industrialized in terms of equipment and materials that have a low cost compared to other techniques. SD produces high quality microparticles by atomizing a hot liquid oil mixture or emulsion through a nozzle into a hot gas chamber, thus producing a particles powder. The spray-drying process has three steps: (i) Preparation of the dispersion or emulsion containing the active material, (ii) homogenization of the dispersion, and (iii) atomization of the resultant mixture into the drying chamber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00400-f002">Figure 2</xref> [<xref rid="B53-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]). Despite the high temperatures generally used in this process (~180 &#x000b0;C), the core temperature remains below 40 &#x000b0;C because of the short time exposition and rapid evaporation of water. SD usually produces hollow, low-density particles with an irregular geometry. The size of the obtained microparticles can vary from 10&#x02013;50 &#x000b5;m at the fine end to 2&#x02013;3 mm at the large end (<xref rid="foods-10-00400-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>), depending upon concentration of the starting solution and operating conditions [<xref rid="B54-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].</p><p>SD can be used to encapsulate different food ingredients, e.g., omega-3 oils, enzymes, bioactive peptides, molecules, probiotics, phenolic compound, antioxidants, antimicrobial agents, vitamins, natural food colorants, flavors, and essential oils [<xref rid="B55-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. A caramel flavor was successfully microencapsulated in a coffee containing milk beverage using spray drying technique [<xref rid="B56-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Microencapsulation of flavor and the addition of the microcapsules to coffee beverages was efficient to prolong flavor retention and improve beverage quality. In a different study, water-dispersible microcapsules containing natural colors such as Anthocyanin and Norbixin were encapsulated into a two-layer shell using a SD technique [<xref rid="B57-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. An inner, solid lipid layer consisted of glycerol mono-oleate (GMO) and soy lecithin, and an outer, water-dispersible system consisted of maltodextrin and poloxamer 338. Anthocyanin- and Norbixin-loaded microcapsules were designed and produced to protect the heat-sensitive colorants from thermal degradation during industrial processing. SD is one of the most commonly used commercial methods for microencapsulation of omega-3 fatty acids as well [<xref rid="B54-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Although spray drying is a common technique, relatively high temperatures used in the drying chamber can harm natural sensitive compounds such as vitamins, lycopene, &#x003b2;-carotene, colorants, and flavors [<xref rid="B58-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. In addition, since this technology uses air at very high temperatures, particles with a porous structure can be produced, leading to decreased stability and reduced shelf-life [<xref rid="B54-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot2-foods-10-00400"><title>4.2. Spray Chilling Technique</title><p>In contrast, the spray chilling/coagulating/cooling (SC) method is based on the atomization of a hot mixture of the active material and lipid carrier in a cold chamber, in which small hot droplets solidify in contact with the cool air to form solid lipid microparticles (SLM) [<xref rid="B59-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. This method does not require the use of high temperatures, water, or organic solvents during the production, making it an environmentally friendly process [<xref rid="B60-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. In addition, in this method the solid lipid microparticles (SLM) are produced in milder temperatures, leading to a reduction in the degradation of sensitive compounds. The microparticles produced by spray chilling technique are dense and display a spherical shape (<xref rid="foods-10-00400-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>), with their active ingredients distributed homogenously throughout the volume of the particle [<xref rid="B61-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. According to the thermal stability of the active agent, a suitable lipid carrier may be chosen, thereby enabling the application of this technique to encapsulate thermolabile materials [<xref rid="B62-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Since this technology is fat based, lipid carriers such as waxes, oils, fatty acids, pure triglycerides, or blends of these materials can be used [<xref rid="B63-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. The most frequently used lipid systems in SC method are fully hydrogenated fats of plant origin (hard fats) with melting points ranging from 36&#x000b0; to 75 &#x000b0;C. The general scheme of spray-chilling process is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00400-f003">Figure 3</xref> [<xref rid="B64-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>].</p><p>The spray chilling procedure consists of an initial heat-melting of the lipid system at 10 &#x000b0;C above its melting point. The molten suspension is then transported into a feeding reservoir placed above the spray-congealing nozzle, pre-heated to 10 &#x000b0;C above the melting temperature of the mixture. Atomization of the molten suspension is then achieved using a wide pneumatic nozzle. The atomized molten droplets solidify in a cooling chamber at room temperature to form spherical microparticles [<xref rid="B32-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The efficiency of the process is one of the principal advantages related to this encapsulation technique. SC is a promising technique to produce solid lipid microparticles loaded with various heat-sensitive bio-additives. Thus, microparticles containing Ascorbic acid (AA, Vitamin C) are successfully produced by spray chilling using stearic acid and hydrogenated vegetable fat as wall materials [<xref rid="B65-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. The obtained microparticles displayed characteristic spherical morphology, high polydispersity, and high encapsulation efficiency (&#x0003e;97%) [<xref rid="B59-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. It was also possible to microencapsulate Ascorbic acid by spray chilling method using mixtures of two fatty acids, lauric acid and oleic acid, as a carrier lipid system. These mixtures were an exceptional lipid medium to control the release of ascorbic acid, showing potential application in food industry [<xref rid="B65-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. The same SC technique was used for the formation of solid lipid microparticles loaded with Ginger Oleoresin (GO); a flavor ingredient frequently used in foods. Lipid mixtures consist from palmitic acid with oleic acid or palm fat were successfully used as carriers, and as a result, high preservation of the volatile compounds of Ginger Oleoresin was accomplished [<xref rid="B43-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. This technique is also widely used in the microencapsulation of Essential Oils (EO) [<xref rid="B66-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Hydrogenated vegetable oil or a wax were used as a molten carrier, creating almost perfectly spherical microparticles with a narrow size distribution. In another work, researchers evaluated the application of spray chilling technique to produce solid lipid microparticles containing Gallic acid as a model phenolic compound, using blends of soybean oil (SO) with fully hydrogenated soybean oil (FHSO) as lipid wall materials [<xref rid="B62-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Probiotics are another active ingredient known for being unstable at elevated temperatures, therefore, using spray chilling process microparticles can be obtained with a survive of larger number of microbes [<xref rid="B67-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. In a recent study, probiotic microorganisms, Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA) and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. Lactis (BL), have been encapsulated in solid lipid microparticles consisting from vegetable fat as a lipid carrier with a melting point of 51 &#x000b0;C. Results showed that spray chilling technique created a dry powder composed of smooth and continuous spheres and the microencapsulated probiotics presented viability at least of 90 days in savory cereal bars [<xref rid="B67-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot3-foods-10-00400"><title>4.3. High-Shear Homogenization</title><p>High-shear homogenization is a simple method in which at a first step lipid is melted above its melting point, followed by addition of poorly water-soluble active agent. At the same time, an aqueous emulsifier solution is heated at the same temperature. In the second step, both materials are mixed and stirred at high-speed using high-shear homogenizer with continuing heating. Solid lipid particles are formed upon cooling of the molten mixture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00400-f004">Figure 4</xref>). This technique can be used for hydrophilic (cold homogenization) and lipophilic (hot homogenization) core molecules. A lesser quantity of emulsifier is required in this process in comparison to the microemulsion technique. Another advantage of high-shear homogenization technique is that lab-scale and large-scale production can also be readily accomplished [<xref rid="B68-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>].</p><p>The hot homogenization technique has been used for production of solid lipid microparticles containing tristearin and babacu oil as the carrier and denatured whey protein isolate (WPI) as a surfactant [<xref rid="B29-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The research evaluated the ability of proposed lipid system to protect Quercetin, a flavonoid known for antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties against degradation. The solid lipid microparticles were produced by melting the lipid phase at 70 &#x000b0;C and then adding the Quercetin. The hot WPI dispersion solution was mixed with the melted lipid followed by ultra-agitation at 12,000 rpm for 5 min. Results showed that the formed microparticles efficiently protected the Quercetin from oxidation, and 85% of the initial amount of the flavonoid was remained after 30 days. A high-shear homogenization method was also used to produce &#x003b2;-carotene-loaded solid lipid microparticles [<xref rid="B39-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B69-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. These SLM were prepared by dispersing the aqueous phase (containing hydrolysed soy protein isolate, HSPI) in the palm stearin with ultra-agitation at 15,000 rpm. The same technique was implemented for encapsulation of essential fatty acids. Hot homogenization was a suitable technique in view of the natural similarity and compatibility between polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and the solid lipid carrier. Chia oil-loaded solid lipid microparticles were obtained by hot homogenization, using stearic acid as a lipid carrier and Tween 80 as a surfactant at 75 &#x000b0;C [<xref rid="B51-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].

Melt Extrusion Technique</title><p>The earliest pioneering work using extrusion for encapsulation can be dated to the late 1950s in the flavor industry, known as melt injection [<xref rid="B71-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Commercial extrusion technique for the microencapsulation of additives in food industry, however, is a relatively less used process. Extrusion is a procedure that enables formation of product with uniform shape and density from a raw material by forcing it through a die under controlled temperature, product flow, and pressure conditions. In a melt extrusion process the matrix components are melted, followed by mixing them with active compounds, thus allowing a smooth lipid mixture to be obtained. The technology is well industry-compatible, whose flexible configuration allows melting, addition, mixing, and cooling of the mixture in a continuous way. The melt extrusion technique includes the following stages: (1) melting of the carrier material inside a twin-screw extruder, (2) direct addition of an active compound, (3) dispersion of the active compound into the coating material, and (4) cooling and shaping of the extrudate, thus producing particles of 0.3&#x02013;5 mm (<xref rid="foods-10-00400-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Hot-melt extrusion offers many advantages over other methods, for example simplicity, continuous operation, and high throughput [<xref rid="B42-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. During extrusion, active materials are mixed with molten excipients, producing homogenous matrix, following by cooling and formation of desired particles forms, like granules, sheets, or strands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00400-f005">Figure 5</xref> [<xref rid="B72-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]). This technology can be used to produce high-density encapsulated products. Melt extrusion promises encapsulation from the economic and environmental perspectives, since it is a one pot process (formation of the wall material, dispersion of the active principle, and forming of the encapsulated material), without use of any organic solvent as well as reduced energy and water consumption.</p><p>Hot-melt extrusion technique was successfully used for preparation of powdered Quercetin-loaded solid lipid microparticles composed from carnauba wax, shellac, and zein [<xref rid="B42-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Physical mixtures were manually fed into a preheated twin-screw melt extruder. The extrusion was conducted continuously at a screw rotation speed of 100 rpm without use of a die. The resulting powders showed meaningfully reduced dissolution in the simulated salivary medium (pH 6.8), which can indicate that achieved efficiency of taste-masking was good. This process is especially suited for encapsulation of highly sensitive citrus flavors as well [<xref rid="B71-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. When rapidly dried, the extruder forms an amorphous, glassy mass that completely encloses flavor droplets, forming small needle shape pellets.

Particle Size and Size Distribution</title><p>The size of the microparticles is a significant parameter in selecting application in foods, because it may cause undesirable sensory changes in products.

To prevent clotting, microparticles were suspended in a Tween 80 aqueous solution (1% w/w) and stabilized for 5 min before analysis. Another useful method for the evaluation of microparticle size is laser diffraction. This technique was applied for particle size analysis of microparticles containing different concentrations of essential oils (EO) using Beckman LS 13320 instrument equipped with a universal liquid module and 2-propanol as dispersant [<xref rid="B66-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>].

Encapsulation Efficiency</title><p>There is no consensus in professional literature defining &#x0201c;encapsulation efficiency&#x0201d;, leading to different equations and methods, therefore making comparisons difficult. Generally, Encapsulation (Incorporation) Efficiency (EE) is defined as the ratio between the quantity of encapsulated material (core material) measured in SLM and the real value used to prepare the particles. The quantity of incorporated additives can be determined using HPLC or UV techniques. Usually, to measure this amount, solid microparticles should first be totally dissolved in an appropriate solvent, following by filtration, and evaluation by the chosen technique. Since a total amount of active ingredient is usually calculated in this way, to evaluate the actual encapsulated amount, a superficial amount should also be measured, then subtracted from the total amount. Efficiency of encapsulation is mostly dependent on interactions between the encapsulant (carrier, solid lipid) and encapsulated compounds (core, food additive), as well as on the encapsulation technique used [<xref rid="B41-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The total encapsulation efficiency (TE) of Ascorbic acid (AA)-loaded SLM was determined by shaking the microparticles in chloroform, followed by the addition of distilled water [<xref rid="B45-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="B60-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].

The TE of the resulting microparticles was defined as the ratio between the total amount of ascorbic acid (AAT) in the sample and the initial amount of ascorbic acid added to the emulsion (AA0) (TE% = AAt/AA0*100). The superficial ascorbic acid (SAA) amount was determined by suspending the particles in a Polysorbate 80 solution. EE was calculated by subtracting the amount of SAA in the AAT in the sample. The ratio was expressed as a percentage representing the EE value: EE (%) = [(AAT-SAA)/AA0] &#x000d7; 100. Encapsulation Efficiency (EE) analyses of SLM containing Vitamin-B12 were evaluated by quantification of amount of Vitamin-B12 in the microparticles using HPLC method [<xref rid="B50-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The EE was determined by similar equation: EE(%) = (TVC&#x02013;CVF)/VCA) &#x000d7; 100%, where TVC is total Vitamin-B12, CVF is a superficial Vitamin-B12 and VCA corresponds to the amount of vitamins added during particles formation.

The gallic acid content of microparticles was quantified after particle dissolution in chloroform and extraction in the aqueous phase using the Foline-Ciocalteau colorimetric method, reading absorbance at 765 nm in a spectrophotometer.

The natural color of microcapsules decreased sharply over time, as a result decomposition of natural colorants in contact with moisture present in produced powder at ambient temperatures. However, the encapsulation of Anthocyanin in microcapsules improved its stability against degradation compared to free Anthocyanin.

Gastrointestinal Stability of Encapsulated Phytochemicals and Food Additives</title><p>Generally, the nature of lipid system used in the formation of microparticles can be valuable not only for the improved intestinal absorption, but also for shielding the food active ingredients against acid and enzymatic degradation when they come in contact with gastric fluid (GF). In produced microparticles, the wall materials must tolerate gastric conditions, such as very low pH and enzyme pepsin existing in the stomach. However, upon approaching the small intestine, microparticles are expecting to release efficiently the core active materials [<xref rid="B50-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Until now only few studies have extensively investigated the dissolution behavior of orally delivered SLM suitable for food applications. Therefore, only recently, one research concentrated on evaluating dissolution profiles of caffeine (CAF) from several formulations of SLM produced employing different lipids using various updated dissolution media to simulate conditions of the entire gastrointestinal tract (gastric tract and proximal human intestine) [<xref rid="B31-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In these dissolution tests, CAF totally dissolved within 5 min both at pH 1.2 (stomach pH) and at pH 6.8 (small intestine pH), indicating high and pH-independent water solubility. It was found, that in the case of bigger particles (&#x0003e;250 &#x003bc;m), SLM composition was crucial for the dissolution behavior of active ingredients, while smaller SLM (100&#x02013;250 &#x003bc;m) were mostly affected by the dissolution liquid content. A comprehensive review on factors affecting the bioavailability of &#x003b2;-carotene incorporated in solid lipid microcapsules was recently published [<xref rid="B77-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. The studies cited in this review show that both the simulated gastric medium and the nature of lipid microcapsules affect the bioavailability of &#x003b2;-carotene. A Vitamin-B12 release tests were performed as well on simulated gastric and intestinal system fluids [<xref rid="B50-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. SLM formed from vegetable fat and soy bean lecithin gradually released 90% of its encapsulated Vitamin-B12 in gastric fluid after 90 min of the experiment. When release studies were performed in simulated intestinal fluid, from the beginning of the analysis a high amount of vitamin was observed for all formulations. In another study, the survival of encapsulated probiotics was found to be above 75% when evaluated under simulated gastrointestinal conditions. The survival of probiotics was satisfied as well under different stress conditions (low pH, high level of sucrose and NaCl), showing that encapsulation improved their protection compared to the free form [<xref rid="B36-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In the case of in vitro release behavior of caramel flavor, the release rate of the resultant particles in the simulated gastric environment was weak; however, the release rate in the simulated intestinal environment increased rapidly within 30 min.

Since synthetic chemical preservatives in food can be harmful to human health, EOs can offer better alternatives. However, the effective application of essential oils as natural preservatives and flavors in the food industry may be limited due to their volatile character as well as their reactivity and hydrophobicity. Thus, their incorporation into water-based foodstuffs requires encapsulation of EOs inside an appropriate matrix [<xref rid="B80-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>,<xref rid="B81-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>].

High consumer demand for the improved flavor of industrial food products led to encapsulation of flavor and aroma compounds. The primary objectives of encapsulation of flavors are to capture and retain the integrity of their complicated composition during the processing and prolonged storage. Flavors can be incorporated into mixtures using a wide variety of carriers. Encapsulated flavors are better protected against external oxidation yielding their greater stability.

Temperature, oxygen, and moisture primarily affect the degradation reactions during these stages. Thus, there is a need to maintain coffee flavor for as long as possible to retain the quality of coffee beverages during its shelf-life. Microencapsulation of coffee flavor can protect flavor compounds from unwelcome chemical changes and may retain flavor mixture during industrial process or storage. A recent study concentrated on retention of the coffee flavor in a coffee-containing milk drinks by their microencapsulation using medium-chain triglyceride and maltodextrin as primary and secondary coating materials [<xref rid="B56-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].

One of these methods includes utilization of great solubility of lycopene in lipophilic solvents such as edible fats and oils and in the formation of solid lipid microparticles. In one study, solid lipid microparticles loaded with lycopene dissolved in sunflower oil solution have been produced from shortening, soy, and palm oils as the carrier [<xref rid="B88-foods-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>].

Vitamins play vital roles in our health due to their specific functions to regulate metabolic and cellular functions, promote health, reproduction and growth, and prevent disease. Vitamin deficiency can lead to severe diseases, such as scurvy, beriberi, and night blindness as well as neurological disorders. The stability of many vitamins is influenced by environmental impacts such as light, temperature, pH, humidity, and oxygen during food processing and storage. These factors usually lead to lose of the nutrient qualities of vitamins in final products, therefore encouraging food industries to develop new methods to prevent these losses by protecting vitamins in production and storage stages.
