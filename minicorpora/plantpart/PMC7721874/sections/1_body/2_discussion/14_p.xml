<p id="Par26">In Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, significant changes are noticed for T
 <sub>onset</sub> values compared with SHEO (T
 <sub>onset</sub> = 124.8 ºC). These values increase from T
 <sub>onset</sub> = 125.3ºC to 171.1ºC, which means that the thermal stability of SHEOx-y samples increases as a result of heating treatment, the heated samples being more stable than the SHEO sample. Compared with the SHEO sample, the SHEO160-0.5 and SHEO175-0.5 show two steps: decrease in mass-loss values in both steps: (i) in the 50–175 ºC range a decrease in mass-loss values to 70.54% and 55.56% respectively, and (ii) in the 175–220 ºC range an increase to 30.8% and 44.76% respectively. The variations observed in mass-loss values are probably due to the vaporization, in 50–175 ºC range, of the compounds less stable to heating, which leads to the enrichment of the essential oil samples in the more stable components. These become preponderant in SHEO175-2.5 and SHEO 190–2.5 samples for which only one stage of mass-loss of (~ 98–99%) was achieved.
