<p id="Par24">Besides, the T
 <sub>onset</sub> values were recorded at 124.8 ºC in both working atmospheres, and a small residual mass of ~ 1.79% was noticed at ~ 300 ºC. These results imply that the decomposition flow types do not influence the thermal stability of the SHEO and the recorded mass-loss steps, because they are not determined by the thermo-oxidative or pyrolysis degradation reactions.
