<p id="Par16">It was evident that we cannot determine by HPLC the volatile compounds identified by GC–MS in the present study, such as γ-terpinene, carvacrol,

 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. The mass spectrum for this compound presented the following 
 <italic>m/z</italic> values: 299(23), 286(13), 192(100), 183(30), 181(55), 171(58), 166(43), 151(83), 136(11), 105(6), 101(6), 60(17), 46(12). The analysis of the mass spectrum pattern leads to the conclusion that the main compound observed is the dimer of carvacrol (C
 <sub>10</sub>H
 <sub>14</sub>O, M = 150 Da) in the SHEO190-2.5 sample, the compound obtained by the dimerization of carvacrol from the sample due to the method used for this separation. As was confirmed by GC–MS analysis, in SHEO190-2.5 carvacrol is the major compound in the sample.
