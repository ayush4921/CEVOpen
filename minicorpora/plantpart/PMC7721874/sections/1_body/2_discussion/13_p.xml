<p id="Par25">From Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> it can be observed that as the heating temperature and time increases, the shape of the DTG and DTA curves shows some changes compared to those obtained for the SHEO sample. Thus, if the SHEO160-0.5 sample still presents the two peaks on the DTG curve well separated, for the SHEO175-0.5 sample the DTG peak recorded in 50–175 ºC range becomes a shoulder and the peak recorded in the 175-220ºC field shows an increase to T
 <sub>DTG</sub> = 191.3ºC. The DTA curves present an endothermic complex effect with a maximum that rises from T
 <sub>DTA</sub> = 190.1ºC (SHEO) to 194.7ºC (SHEO175-0.5). For SHEO175-2.5 and SHEO190-2.5 samples, only one mass-loss step was recorded in 50–220 ºC temperature range with the T
 <sub>DTG</sub> ~ 203.1 ºC and T
 <sub>DTA</sub> ~ 206.9 ºC. Besides, the shape of DTA endothermic curves becomes more symmetrical.
