<p id="Par18">According to GC–MS results, in the case of SHEO, the compounds which have a major influence on the ATR-FTIR spectrum are 
 <italic>γ</italic>-terpinene, carvacrol, and 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene. A small influence could be given by α-terpinolene, α-pinene, β-pinene, and caryophyllene. The recorded ATR-FTIR spectra for the investigated samples are depicted in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and several characteristic bands can be extracted even if the analyzed essential oil is a complex mixture and the spectra display a total overlap of each absorption spectrum of its components. The intense band seen at 812 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> can be attributed to out-of-plane C–H waggins vibrations from carvacrol. This significant signal is used in distinguishing the type of aromatic ring substitution in the isomeric compounds carvacrol and thymol, with the thymol isomer presenting its vibration at 804 cm

 </sup>. Furthermore, other characteristic bands of carvacrol were identified at: 867 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (C–H out-of-plane bending vibration), 994 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (wagging vibration of 1:2:4 substitution), 1116 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (wagging vibration of 
 <italic>ortho</italic>-substitution) and 1174 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (
 <italic>ortho</italic>-substitution), 1459, 1422 and 1302 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>(C–C stretching vibration from phenyl group and CH

 <sup>−1</sup>, the -OH stretching vibration from carvacrol was observed
