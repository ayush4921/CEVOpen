<p id="Par29">For a step recorded in the TG curve to be given by a non-activated vaporization process, the mass-loss recorded relative to time or temperature should be a zero-order transformation. According to Hazra, et al.

 </sup> and Martins, et al. 
 <sup>

 </sup>, the shape of the DTG curve has an essential role in deciding the reaction order. Thus, for zero-order kinetic, the DTG curve is characterized by an abrupt return from the maximum point (
