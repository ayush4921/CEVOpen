<p id="Par12">The TG/DTG/DTA curves of the essential oil samples were recorded in air, and the nitrogen decomposition atmosphere, and are depicted in Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>. For the SHEO sample, the thermal stability between 30 and 50 ºC is visible, while in the 50–220 ºC temperature range, TG curves show a continuous mass-loss. In Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> are presented DTG and DTA curves for the samples with two peaks for SHEO160-0.5 and SHEO175-0.5 samples, and only one peak for SHEO175-2.5 and SHEO190-2.5 samples.
