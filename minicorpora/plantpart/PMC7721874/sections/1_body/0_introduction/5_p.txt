0: This study aimed to analyze the thermal behavior, by characterizing the recorded mass-loss stages and by evaluating the kinetic parameters of non-activated vaporization processes, for  S.hortensis essential oil samples (heated and unheated) in correlation with their chemical composition and in vitro antioxidant activity.
1: The correlation of the thermal behavior with the chemical composition for  S.hortensis essential oil depending on the heating conditions treatment, to which the samples were subjected, constitute a novelty in the field.
