<p id="Par42">The TG/DTG/DTA thermo-analytical curves were recorded on an STA 409C Luxx system, produced by Netzsch-Germany. The experiments were conducted on 30-300ºC temperature range, at β = 10 K
 <sup>·</sup>min
 <sup>−1</sup> heating rates, using platinum crucibles in dynamic air (100 mL.min
 <sup>−1</sup>, 20% O
