<p id="Par40">The analyses were performed using a liquid chromatograph (Nexera X2, Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan) with a diode array detector (M30A, Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan) and a mass spectrometer (Model 8040, Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan). The separation of compounds was performed on column (Nucleosil EC 135/4 100–3 C18, 4.0 mm i.d. × 125 mm column length, 3 µm particle size, Macherey–Nagel GmbH, Duren, Germany). The column temperature was maintained at 25 ºC, and the flow rate at 0.7 ml min
 <sup>−1</sup>. The solvents used for the chromatographic elution were ultra-pure water with 0.1% TFA (A) and acetonitrile (B). The chromatographic elution program as following: with 80% A and 20% B for 15 min, changed to 100% B in one minute, and then maintained at 100% B for another one minute. The injected volume of samples was 10 µl. The DAD detector spectra were recorded between 190 and 700 nm. The mass spectrometer was equipped with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source operated in positive ion mode, and quantification was carried out in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. The mass range was between 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 15 and 1500, scan speed 1500 u/sec. The ion spray temperature was maintained at 250 °C. The drying gas flow rate was 15 L/min.
