<p>The skin is a sensitive indicator of nutritional deficiencies. The most effective way to improve the condition of the skin is to supply it with essential nutrients, both externally and—importantly—internally, through a varied diet. An increasing body of research suggests that a well-balanced diet significantly affects the skin ageing process. It is worth noting the substances that protect and restore the epidermal barrier, which reduces TEWL, ensuring an appropriate level of skin hydration and protecting against external factors and the damage induced by inflammation (e.g., omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids). Antioxidants and other phytonutrients that scavenge ROS and alleviate oxidative skin damage also play an important role in the prophylaxis and care of ageing skin, as do substances that protect the skin against the negative effects of ultraviolet radiation (including vitamins A, C and E; selenium; zinc; copper; silicon; polyphenols; and carotenoids). The oral administration of antioxidants can be an effective supplement to chemical and physical UV-filtering agents and can reduce the DNA damage leading to skin ageing and the development of skin cancer. The inclusion of these substances in the daily diet could be a useful approach in anti-ageing interventions. In conclusion, the promotion of healthy dietary habits can benefit the appearance of the skin, delay ageing processes and reduce the risk of skin cancer. </p>
