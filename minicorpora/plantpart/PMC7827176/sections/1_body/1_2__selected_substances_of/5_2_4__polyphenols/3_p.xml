<p>The health-promoting effects of polyphenols taken orally are linked to their bioavailability, which is largely dependent on their chemical structure. The bioavailability depends on the amounts of nutrients that are digested, absorbed and included in metabolic processes [

Polyphenols inhibit the activity of enzymes present in the skin—collagenase and elastase, which catalyze the hydrolysis of collagen and elastin fibers, and hyaluronidase, which degrades hyaluronic acid. Furthermore, they soothe irritation and reduce the redness of skin, accelerating the natural regeneration of the epidermis, stabilizing the capillaries, improving microcirculation and elasticity in the skin, and protecting against harmful external factors, including UV radiation [
