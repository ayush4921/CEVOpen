<p>The presence of antioxidants has been shown to be linked to a lower frequency of ROS-induced photoaging [

The antioxidant and antiradical properties of polyphenols result from the elimination of radicals through direct reactions, scavenging, or the reduction of free radicals (e.g., hydroxyl, superoxide, peroxide and alcoxyl radicals) to less reactive compounds. Polyphenols can also chelate transition metal cations (e.g., Cu
 <sup>2+</sup> and Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>), thus preventing Haber–Weiss and Fenton reactions (which lead to the generation of the extremely reactive hydroxyl radical •OH) and also inhibiting the activity of many enzymes involved in free radical generation (e.g., xanthine oxidase, protein kinase and lipoxygenase). Their activity also involves the stimulation and protection of other antioxidants, such as ascorbate in the cytosol or tocopherol in biological membranes [
