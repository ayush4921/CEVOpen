<p>Raw polyphenolic materials exert synergistic effects with other antioxidants in preventing skin ageing. Cho et al. investigated the effect of the oral administration of an antioxidant mixture of pycnogenol, evening primrose oil, vitamin C and vitamin E on UVB-induced wrinkle formation. The study showed that a 10-week administration of the antioxidants to hairless mice irradiated three times a week with UVB radiation significantly prevented the UVB-induced expression of MMPs and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, as well as the activation of the transcription factor AP-1. It also enhanced the expression of type I procollagen and TGF-Î²2). The results indicate that the oral administration of the antioxidant mixture can inhibit wrinkle formation by preventing the expression of MMPs and increasing collagen synthesis [
