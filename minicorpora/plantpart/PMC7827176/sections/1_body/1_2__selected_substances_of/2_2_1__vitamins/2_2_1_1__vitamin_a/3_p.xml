<p>Beta-carotene is metabolized in the small intestine, leading to the formation of the aldehyde retinal, which can be reduced to retinol through enzymatic conversion. This process is reversible, and the alcohol can be converted as needed into retinal in an oxidation process catalyzed by retinol dehydrogenase. Further oxidation is irreversible and produces tretinoin. Tretinoin is thus the main metabolite of retinol, but it can be synthesized in certain tissues (e.g., the epidermal cells) without retinol, from retinal generated via the degradation of β-carotene. Retinyl esters in the enterocytes are converted to retinol, after which they are modified again and stored as retinyl esters in chylomicrons, before being released into the blood and supplied to cells and tissues associated with their carrier protein. The transport and activity of retinoids require specific proteins occurring in both the plasma (RBP—retinoid-binding proteins) and the cytoplasm (CRBP—cellular retinoid-binding proteins). In cell nuclei, retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and retinoid X receptors (RXRs, for all retinoids) have been detected [
