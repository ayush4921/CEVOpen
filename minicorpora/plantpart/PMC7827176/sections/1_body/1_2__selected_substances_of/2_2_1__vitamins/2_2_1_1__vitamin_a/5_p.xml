<p>The anti-ageing effects of retinoids are mediated by three major types of skin cells: epidermal keratinocytes, dermal endothelial cells and fibroblasts [
 <xref rid="B38-nutrients-13-00203" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Topically applied retinoids penetrate the keratinized epidermis and, to a lesser extent, the dermis and subcutaneous tissue [
 <xref rid="B27-nutrients-13-00203" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B30-nutrients-13-00203" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-nutrients-13-00203" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. A study in mice by Törmä et al. showed that retinol esters accounted for 90% of the vitamin A in the epidermis, with retinol making up the remaining 10% [
 <xref rid="B39-nutrients-13-00203" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. After penetrating the epidermis, retinoids play a role in the release of transcription and growth factors. They are responsible for the renewal of the epidermis through their active role in the exfoliation of dead cells in the stratum corneum and the proliferation of live cells in the epidermal layers [
 <xref rid="B28-nutrients-13-00203" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34-nutrients-13-00203" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-nutrients-13-00203" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Moreover, vitamin A promotes the compaction of the stratum corneum and deposition of GAGs in the stratum corneum and intercellular spaces in the epidermis [
 <xref rid="B40-nutrients-13-00203" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. A study conducted by Kang et al. showed that the application of all-trans-retinol on normal human skin induced epidermal thickening and increased the mRNA expression of cellular retinoic acid binding protein and cellular retinol binding protein [
 <xref rid="B41-nutrients-13-00203" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Retinoids also reduce transepidermal water loss (TEWL) by strengthening the epidermal barrier [
 <xref rid="B28-nutrients-13-00203" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34-nutrients-13-00203" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-nutrients-13-00203" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. After penetrating the dermis, retinoids increase the synthesis of elastin and collagen by stimulating the fibroblasts [
 <xref rid="B42-nutrients-13-00203" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Topical retinol improves the dermal extracellular matrix (ECM) microenvironment (type I collagen, fibronectin, and elastin) and activates ECM-producing cells in aged skin [
 <xref rid="B32-nutrients-13-00203" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="B38-nutrients-13-00203" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The activation of fibroblast production is stimulated through the TGF-β/CTGF pathway, the major regulator of ECM homeostasis [
 <xref rid="B38-nutrients-13-00203" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Retinoids and all biologically active forms of vitamin A also promote the remodeling of reticulin fibers and synthesis of a new capillary network in the dermis. This process influences the condition of the connective tissue of the dermis, improving its firmness, hydration and elasticity [
 <xref rid="B35-nutrients-13-00203" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="B42-nutrients-13-00203" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Retinoids protect collagen against the destruction induced by MMPs, as well as enhancing the synthesis of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) [
 <xref rid="B32-nutrients-13-00203" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="B42-nutrients-13-00203" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Varani et al. observed that topical vitamin A (retinol) reduced MMP expression and increased fibroblast growth and collagen synthesis in naturally aged, as it did in photoaged, skin [
 <xref rid="B42-nutrients-13-00203" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Pierard-Franchimont et al. showed that a retinol formulation improved the physical properties of ageing facial skin, including tensile properties and contours, after 12 weeks of treatment [
