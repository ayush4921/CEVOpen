Antille et al. conducted a study to assess the ability of retinyl palmitate to protect the skin, prevent DNA damage and protect against the induction of erythema by a single exposure to strong UVB radiation. The results clearly indicate that retinyl esters present in the epidermis have strong antiphotocarcinogenic properties and protect DNA against damage by UV radiation [
