<p>The antioxidant properties of vitamin C protect the skin, especially the epidermis, against oxidants generated by ultraviolet radiation and other environmental factors. Although the direct antioxidant protection provided by vitamin C is limited to aqueous compartments, vitamin C significantly curtails lipid oxidation by regenerating fat-soluble vitamin E; it regenerates α-tocopherol from α-tocopherol radicals found in cell membranes and lipoproteins [

 <xref rid="B61-nutrients-13-00203" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]; Offord et al. assessed the photoprotective potential of vitamin C and other antioxidants, confirming that vitamin C plays a significant role in protecting the skin against UVA radiation [

Placzek et al., in a study with human volunteers, showed that the oral administration of ascorbic acid and D-alpha-tocopherol for three months significantly reduced the sunburn reaction to UVB irradiation. The results of that study also suggest that supplementation with a combination of the two antioxidants protects against DNA damage [
