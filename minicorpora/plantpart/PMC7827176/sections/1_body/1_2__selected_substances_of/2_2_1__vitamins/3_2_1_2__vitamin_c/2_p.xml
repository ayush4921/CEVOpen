<p>As humans lack L-gulonolactone oxidase, the enzyme enabling its production, this vitamin must be supplied in the diet (
 <xref rid="nutrients-13-00203-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). About 70–80% of it is absorbed in the duodenum and the proximal part of the small intestine. The absorption and bioavailability of vitamin C are affected by the current metabolic state of the body, as well as by age and sex. Digestive and absorption disorders, vomiting, diarrhea, smoking, and certain medicines, such as aspirin, significantly affect its concentration in the body [

There are two transport mechanisms for ascorbic acid, and these depend on the sodium–ascorbate cotransporters (SVCTs) present in various tissues and organs. In the skin, sodium–ascorbate cotransporter-1 (SVCT1) is responsible for the transport of epidermal vitamin C to the keratinocytes, while sodium–ascorbate cotransporter-2 (SVCT2) is responsible for intradermal transport [
