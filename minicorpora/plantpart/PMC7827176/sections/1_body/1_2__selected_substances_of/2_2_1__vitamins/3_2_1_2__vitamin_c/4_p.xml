<p>The role of vitamin C in differentiating keratinocytes is being researched. The vitamin has been shown to enhance keratinocyte differentiation, reduce differentiation-dependent oxidative stress and maintain the integrity of the skin barrier, which in turn helps to prevent water loss from the skin [

Pasonen-Seppanen et al. showed that vitamin C enhanced the differentiation of rat epidermal keratinocytes cell line in an organotypic culture model, resulting in a stronger stratum corneum, which indicates that it has a skin-protective function [

Savini et al., in an in vitro study on normal human epidermal keratinocytes, showed that ascorbate improves the barrier functions of the epidermis and promotes the formation of the cornified cell envelope, a specialized structure that protects the body against harmful chemical and physical factors [
