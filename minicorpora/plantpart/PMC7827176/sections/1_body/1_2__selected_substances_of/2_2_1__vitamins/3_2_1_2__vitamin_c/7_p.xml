<p>Vitamin C is also thought to be involved in inhibiting melanogenesis. Melanin, a natural skin pigment resulting from complex biochemical conversions in melanocytes catalysed by tyrosinase, plays an important role in photoprotection. The overproduction of melanin, however, may contribute to hyperpigmented diseases as well as the initiation of melanomas [
