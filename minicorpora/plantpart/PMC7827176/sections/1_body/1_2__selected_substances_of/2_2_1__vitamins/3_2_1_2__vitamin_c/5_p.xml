<p>The biological function of vitamin C in the skin is its active role in collagen synthesis. It is responsible for the biosynthesis of collagen through its role in the hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues to hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine. It donates electrons to enzymes involved in hydroxylation, resulting in the conversion of procollagen to collagen [

 <xref rid="B49-nutrients-13-00203" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. It functions as a cofactor of proline and lysine hydroxylases, which are responsible for the tertiary structure of collagen; promotes the expression of collagen genes; and activates the production of collagen mRNA by fibroblasts [

There is scientific evidence that ascorbic acid plays an active role in the proliferation and migration of skin fibroblasts and stimulates the production of collagen and elastin in cultures of fibroblasts [

 <xref rid="B49-nutrients-13-00203" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Supplementation with vitamin C enhances the production of GAGs, promotes the expression of genes coding for antioxidant enzymes and enzymes involved in DNA repair, and inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and apoptosis induced by UV radiation or other harmful environmental factors [
