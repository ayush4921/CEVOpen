Tsoureli-Nikita et al. conducted a study to evaluate the effect of oral vitamin E supplementation on the improvement and remission of atopic dermatitis. The results, which indicated relationships between vitamin E, the IgE level and the clinical symptoms of atopy, suggest that vitamin E can be used to treat atopic dermatitis [

The results suggest that the clinical transplantation of keratinocytes preconditioned with vitamin E, alone or in combination with skin fibroblasts in skin substitutes, could be used to treat thermally damaged skin [
