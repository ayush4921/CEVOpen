<p>Zinc (Zn) is an essential microelement with an important role in many physiological processes [
 <xref rid="B97-nutrients-13-00203" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. A deficiency can cause a number of health problems, so it is essential to ensure an adequate intake, mainly through a balanced diet containing both animal and plant products, but also by addressing factors that can impede the absorption of this element. Zinc can be supplied in food products (
