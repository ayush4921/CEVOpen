<p>Selenium plays a role as part of the structure of enzymatic proteins. It is also an element of three families of enzymes: glutathione peroxidases (GPx), thioredoxin reductases (TrxR) and iodothyronionic deionidases (DIOs). Twelve single selenoproteins occur in the human body, including selenoprotein P, responsible for controlling redox potential in cells and the transport of selenium to peripheral tissues. Selenium exhibits strong antioxidant properties and protects against DNA damage [
