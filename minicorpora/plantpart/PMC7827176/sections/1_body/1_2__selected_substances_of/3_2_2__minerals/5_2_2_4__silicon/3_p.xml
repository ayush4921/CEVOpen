<p>Organic silicon plays an important role in skin structure, promotes neocollagenesis, strengthens connective tissue, and reduces the risk of alopecia [

 <xref rid="B140-nutrients-13-00203" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>]. Si also promotes the synthesis of elastin and GAGs, helps to preserve blood vessel elasticity, and increases the resistance and thickness of nail and hair fibers [
 <xref rid="B135-nutrients-13-00203" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>]. Barel et al. demonstrated that the oral intake of choline-stabilized orthosilicic acid for 20 weeks had a significant positive effect on the surface and mechanical properties of skin. Treatment with silicon may also improve keratin structure in the hair and nails and reduce brittleness [

 <xref rid="B141-nutrients-13-00203" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>]. Kalil et al. described the positive effect of orthosilicic acid stabilized with hydrolyzed marine collagen at 600 mg/day on skin texture, firmness and hydration [

Ferreira et al. investigated the oral intake of two forms of Si—maltodextrin-stabilized orthosilicic acid (M-OSA) and monomethylsilanetriol (MMST)—and their effects on the nails, skin and hair. They were found to improve skin parameters, increase eyelash length, reduce facial wrinkles and UV spots, and act as aluminum detoxification agents [
 <xref rid="B135-nutrients-13-00203" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>]. Barel et al. studied the effect of supplements containing choline-stabilized orthosilicic acid (ch-OSA) on the skin, hair and nails. In a group of 50 women with photodamaged facial skin taking 10 mg of Si/day orally for 20 weeks, significant improvements were observed in the surface characteristics and mechanical properties of the skin, as was a positive effect on the brittleness of the hair and nails [
