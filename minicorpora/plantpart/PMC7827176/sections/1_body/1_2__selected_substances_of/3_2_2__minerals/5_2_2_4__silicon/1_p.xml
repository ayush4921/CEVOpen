<p>Silicon (Si) is the second most abundant element on Earth, present in water, plants and animals [
 <xref rid="B134-nutrients-13-00203" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>] and it has semi-metallic properties. In nature, it is not normally found in free form but is usually present as a chemical compound of silicon dioxide, a complex compound, or silicon silicate [

 <xref rid="B136-nutrients-13-00203" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>]. The silicon present in food is solubilized in the acidic environment of the stomach, becoming easily absorbed orthosilicic acid (OSA) [
