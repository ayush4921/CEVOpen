<p>Copper is also important for the overall condition of the skin. Cu stimulates the proliferation of dermal fibroblasts and is involved in the synthesis and stabilization of extracellular matrix skin proteins and angiogenesis. It is a cofactor of superoxide dismutase (SOD), an enzyme involved in protecting the skin against the harmful effects of free radicals, and also prevents oxidative damage to cell membranes and lipid peroxidation [

Copper deficiency reduces the activity of the enzyme Cu/Zn-SOD and ceruloplasmin, as well as copper-independent enzymes, including catalase and glutathione peroxidase. Copper also promotes the function of free radical scavengers such as metallothionein and glutathione. A deficiency of copper ions in the plasma, liver, erythrocytes and heart increases the concentration of the lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde (MDA) [
