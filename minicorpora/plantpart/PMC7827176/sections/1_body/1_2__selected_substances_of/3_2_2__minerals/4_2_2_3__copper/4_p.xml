<p>Furthermore, Cu is a cofactor of tyrosinase, the main enzyme involved in synthesis of the skin pigment melanin [
 <xref rid="B128-nutrients-13-00203" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>]. In the active center of the enzyme, in the N-terminal domain, there are two copper atoms, which are coordinated by three histidine residues. Three types of tyrosinase are involved in melanogenesis: oxytyrosinase (E
 <sub>oxy</sub>), mettyrosinase (E
 <sub>met</sub>) and deoxytyrosinase (E
 <sub>deoxy</sub>) [
