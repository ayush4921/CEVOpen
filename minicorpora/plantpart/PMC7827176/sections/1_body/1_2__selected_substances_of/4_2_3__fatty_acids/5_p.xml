<p>Unsaturated fatty acids are not synthesized in the human body, so they must be supplied through the diet. An important source of EFAs is vegetable oils obtained from seeds, fruit, nuts and sprouts [
 <xref rid="B156-nutrients-13-00203" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>]. The biological value and cosmetic suitability of oils depend on their percentages of fatty acids, both saturated (e.g., stearic and palmitic acid) and unsaturated (e.g., oleic, linoleic, linolenic and arachidonic acid). Vegetable oils rich in LA include wheat germ, soybean, sunflower seed and sesame seed oil [

Oils rich in EFAs improve skin hydration, have a regenerative effect on the damaged epidermal lipid barrier, and regulate skin metabolism. Vegetable oils play an important role in the care of dry, sensitive, oily, acne-prone and mature skin [
