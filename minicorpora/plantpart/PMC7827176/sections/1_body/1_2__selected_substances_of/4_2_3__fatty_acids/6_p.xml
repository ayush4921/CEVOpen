<p>Omega-3 acids obtained from fish oil—eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)—also play an important role in skin function. Although these acids are not present in the normal epidermis, their metabolites (epidermal 15-lipoxygenase transforms EPA into 15-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid (15-HEPE) and DHA into 17-hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid (17-HDoHE)) accumulate in it after the consumption of fish oil [

Rhodes et al., in a study with a group of 15 people given fish oil containing 1.8 g of EPA and 1.2 g of DHA, observed a marked reduction in UVB-erythemal sensitivity after six months of supplementation [

In a randomized double-blind trial in 42 healthy patients taking 4 g/day of EPA or monounsaturated oleic acid for three months, an increase in the UV-induced erythematous threshold was observed, as was a decrease in the expression of the protein p53, a marker of DNA damage induced by UV radiation. The results indicate that EPAs have a UV-filtering effect and suggest that longer-term supplementation may reduce the risk of skin cancer in humans [
