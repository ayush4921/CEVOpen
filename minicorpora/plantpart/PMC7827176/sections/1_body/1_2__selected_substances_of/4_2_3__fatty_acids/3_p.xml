<p>Owing to unsaturated fatty acids, which, alongside ceramides and cholesterol, are components of the intracellular cement, the skin can act as an effective barrier limiting TEWL, thus ensuring adequate hydration and protecting against external factors [

The results of recent research on the beneficial effects of GLA on various dermatological conditions are promising and support the hypothesis that it is an essential fatty acid for skin function. GLA applied topically as a cream penetrates to the stratum corneum, while taken orally, it reaches the dermis, enhancing its cohesiveness and preventing excessive TEWL [
