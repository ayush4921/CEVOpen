<p>The symptoms of fatty acid deficiency include dryness of the epidermis, peeling, flabby skin, skin inflammation, an increased susceptibility to irritation and slower healing. A deficiency of LA, a component of ceramide 1, which plays an important role in the cohesiveness of the intracellular cement, results in the dysfunction of the skin barrier and symptoms of dry skin. Research by Cosgrove et al. showed that a higher LA intake is associated with a lower likelihood of senile dryness and skin atrophy [
