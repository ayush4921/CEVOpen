 <xref rid="B224-nutrients-13-00203" ref-type="bibr">224</xref>]. In the human body, carotenoids mainly accumulate in lipid tissue cells and the liver. They are also present in the horny layer of the epidermis, as confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. The content of carotenoids in human skin varies, with the highest levels observed in parts of the body with high concentrations of sweat and sebaceous glands (e.g., the forehead and hands). The total content of carotenoids in the skin is influenced by numerous factors, such as the intake of fruits and vegetables, their bioavailability from various foods, supplementation, exposure to UV radiation, air pollution, alcohol consumption, smoking and stress [
