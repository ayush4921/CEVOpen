<p>Carotenoids prevent ageing, stimulate fibroblasts to produce collagen and elastin, inhibit the activity of MMPs, and exhibit anti-inflammatory and UV-filtering effects [

 <xref rid="B231-nutrients-13-00203" ref-type="bibr">231</xref>]. They have been shown to improve the elasticity, hydration and texture of skin; reduce TEWL; lighten the skin; reduce discoloration; and delay the signs of photoaging [

 <xref rid="B233-nutrients-13-00203" ref-type="bibr">233</xref>]. Yoon et al. investigated the effect of astaxanthin (2 mg/day) and collagen hydrolysate (3 g/day) supplementation on moderately photoaged skin in humans. The bioactives significantly improved barrier integrity, reduced TEWL, and increased the expression of procollagen type I mRNA. The results indicate that astaxanthin combined with collagen hydrolysate, due to the beneficial effects of the compounds on skin elasticity and hydration, can be used as an anti-ageing agent for photoaged skin [
 <xref rid="B234-nutrients-13-00203" ref-type="bibr">234</xref>]. A study by Juturu et al. showed that supplementation with 10 mg of lutein and 2 mg of zeaxanthin isomers daily for 12 weeks improves the appearance of skin and lightens skin tone [
 <xref rid="B233-nutrients-13-00203" ref-type="bibr">233</xref>]. Schwartz et al. evaluated the effect of zeaxanthin on skin parameters such as fine and deep lines, total wrinkles, wrinkle severity, radiance/skin color, discoloration and skin pigment homogeneity. The results indicate that a zeaxanthin-based dietary supplement and topical serum improve hydration and reduce wrinkles in facial skin [
 <xref rid="B235-nutrients-13-00203" ref-type="bibr">235</xref>]. Furthermore, carotenoids support healing processes and protect the skin against the oxidative stress resulting from excessive ROS activity, thereby reducing the risk of skin cancer [

 <xref rid="B237-nutrients-13-00203" ref-type="bibr">237</xref>]. Research confirms the photoprotective effects of carotenoids in the diet and in the form of dietary supplements. Wertz et al. investigated this effect in the case of β-carotene. This compound was found to suppress the UVA induction of MMP-1, MMP-3 and MMP-10, the three main metalloproteinases involved in photoaging. Moreover, β-carotene was shown to block the 
 <sup>1</sup>O
 <sub>2</sub>-mediated induction of MMP-1 and MMP-10 in a dose-dependent manner [
 <xref rid="B228-nutrients-13-00203" ref-type="bibr">228</xref>]. Cesarini et al., in a group of 25 subjects, studied the effect of an orally administered antioxidant complex consisting of β-carotene, lycopene, selenium and α-tocopherol on parameters of the protection of the epidermis against UV-induced skin damage. After 6 weeks of the application of the antioxidants, an increase in protection against UV-induced skin damage was observed, accompanied by a reduction in lipoperoxide levels and sunburn cells (SBCs), as well as an increase in skin pigmentation [
 <xref rid="B238-nutrients-13-00203" ref-type="bibr">238</xref>]. Other research has shown a significant reduction in UV-induced erythema and improvement in the hydration and elasticity of skin following the oral application of lutein [
 <xref rid="B237-nutrients-13-00203" ref-type="bibr">237</xref>]. Heinrich et al. compared the erythema-protective effect of 24 mg/d of beta-carotene from an algal source to that of 24 mg/d of a carotenoid mixture (beta-carotene, lutein and lycopene, at 8 mg/d each). An increase in carotenoid levels in the serum and skin was observed after 12 weeks of supplementation in both groups, as was a comparable reduction in UV-induced erythema [
 <xref rid="B239-nutrients-13-00203" ref-type="bibr">239</xref>]. Aust et al. evaluated the photoprotective effects of synthetic lycopene in comparison with those of a tomato extract and a drink containing solubilized tomato extract. The subjects ingested similar amounts of lycopene (about 10 mg/d) from all three sources. After 12 weeks of supplementation, significant increases in serum lycopene levels and total skin carotenoids were observed in all the groups, as was less severe erythema following exposure to UV radiation. The protective effects were more pronounced in the groups that received the tomato extract or a drink containing solubilized tomato extract [
 <xref rid="B240-nutrients-13-00203" ref-type="bibr">240</xref>]. These studies indicate that a photoprotective effect and reduction in the severity of UV-induced erythema can be ascribed to the entire family of carotenoids.
