<p>One of the most common dermatological and cosmetic concerns is skin ageing: a natural, complex process influenced by two mechanisms—intrinsic (genetic, chronological) ageing resulting from the passage of time, and extrinsic ageing (photoaging), caused by environmental factors (including UV radiation, environmental pollution and cigarette smoke) [

 <xref rid="B8-nutrients-13-00203" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The two processes overlap and are closely linked to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress in the skin [
 <xref rid="B9-nutrients-13-00203" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Both the intrinsic and extrinsic processes are associated with biochemical disturbances (e.g., the excessive formation of oxygen radicals, leading to protein and DNA damage, amino acid racemization, and non-enzymatic glycosylation, leading to the abnormal cross-linking of collagen fibers and other structural proteins), as well as changes in the physical, morphological and physiological properties of the epidermis and dermis. These include disturbances in the function of the epidermal barrier, the flattening of the dermal–epidermal junction, a reduced number and activity of fibroblasts, the accumulation of abnormal elastin fibers (elastosis), and the impaired functioning of Langerhans cells [

Features characteristic of mature skin include wrinkles, a loss of elasticity, changes in color, uneven pigmentation and discoloring, dryness, foci of abnormal epidermal keratosis, telangiectasias, susceptibility to irritation, and slower skin regeneration and healing [
