<p>The skin is the largest organ of the human body. It is composed of the epidermis, which consists of epithelial tissue, and the dermis, which consists of connective tissue. Under the dermis, there is a layer of subcutaneous tissue called the hypodermis (

The epidermis comprises a horny layer (stratum corneum), a clear layer (stratum lucidum), a granular layer (stratum granulosum), a spinous layer (stratum spinosum) and a basal layer (stratum basale). Apart from keratinocytes—cells involved in keratinization—the five-layer epidermis also contains pigment cells and melanocytes, as well as Langerhans cells, mastocytes, and Merkel cells. It is closely connected to the dermis underneath by the basement membrane. The dermis, which comprises a papillary layer (primarily loose connective tissue) and a reticular layer (dense connective tissue), contains fibroblasts responsible for the production of collagen, elastin, and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), as well as numerous blood vessels, nerve endings, and appendages, such as hair follicles and sweat and sebaceous glands. The subcutaneous tissue consists of loose connective tissue containing fat cells (adipocytes) forming fat lobules [
