0: The skin performs a wide variety of complex functions.
1: It provides an optimal environment for deeper tissues by separating them from the external environment and, at the same time, ensures contact with it through the exchange of substances and reception of stimuli.
2: The skin protects against biological agents (potentially pathogenic microbes), chemical agents (corrosive, irritating and allergenic substances) and physical factors (sunlight, ionizing radiation, infrared radiation, and mechanical and thermal factors).
3: It performs important functions in water and electrolyte balance (epidermal barrier and sweat glands), thermoregulation (thermoreceptors) and the immune response (skin-associated lymphoid tissues (SALT)).
4: It is also an important sensory organ (with free nerve endings, Pacinian corpuscles, Meissner corpuscles, Ruffini corpuscles, Krause end bulbs and Merkel cells).
5: In addition, it is involved in metabolism and homeostasis and is responsible for the elimination, selective absorption and storage of substances [ 1, 4].
