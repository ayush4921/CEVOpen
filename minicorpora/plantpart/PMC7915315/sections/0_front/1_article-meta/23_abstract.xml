 <p>Background: 
  <italic>Myrtus communis</italic> (
  <italic>M. communis</italic>) is a wild aromatic plant used for traditional herbal medicine that can be demonstrated in insecticidal, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial activity of its essential oils (MCEO). Aim: The present study aimed to evaluate the prophylactic effects of 
  <italic>M. communis</italic> essential oil (MCEO) against chronic toxoplasmosis induced by the Tehran strain of 
  <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> in mice. Methods: Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis was performed to determine the chemical composition of MCEO. Mice were then orally administrated with MCEO at the doses of 100, 200, and 300 mg/kg/day and also atovaquone 100 mg/kg for 21 days. On the 15th day, the mice were infected with the intraperitoneal inoculation of 20–25 tissue cysts from the Tehran strain of 
  <italic>T. gondii</italic>. The mean numbers of brain tissue cysts and the mRNA levels of IL-12 and IFN-γ in mice of each tested group were measured. Results: By GC/MS, the major constituents were α-pinene (24.7%), 1,8-cineole (19.6%), and linalool (12.6%), respectively. The results demonstrated that the mean number of 
  <italic>T. gondii</italic> tissue cysts in experimental groups Ex1 (
  <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), Ex2 (
  <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and Ex3 (
  <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) was meaningfully reduced in a dose-dependent manner compared with the control group (C2). The mean diameter of tissue cyst was significantly reduced in mice of the experimental groups Ex2 (
  <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) and Ex3 (
  <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). The results demonstrated that although the mRNA levels of IFN-γ and IL-12 were elevated in all mice of experimental groups, a significant increase (
  <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) was observed in tested groups of Ex2 and Ex3 when compared with control groups. Conclusion: The findings of the present study demonstrated the potent prophylactic effects of MCEO especially in the doses 200 and 300 mg/kg in mice infected with 
  <italic>T. gondii</italic>. Although the exceptional anti-
  <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> effects of MCEO and other possessions, such as improved innate immunity and low toxicity are positive topics, there is, however, a need for more proof from investigations in this field.
