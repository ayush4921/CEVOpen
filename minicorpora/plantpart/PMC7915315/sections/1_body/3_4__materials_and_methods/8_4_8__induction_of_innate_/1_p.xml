<p>The mRNA levels of IFN-γ, and IL12 which are considered as key factors related to toxoplasmosis control mechanisms were measured in all tested mice using quantitative real time PCR. The total brain RNA was extracted by means of the RNA-easy kits (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany); whereas all isolated RNAs were reverse-transcribed according to the manufacture’s protocols. Consequently, the collected complementary DNA (cDNA) was applied to conventional PCR amplification or real-time PCR. To perform the Real-time PCR we used the iQ5 real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). All amplification products were determined by SYBR green [

The reaction conditions of real-time PCR were included initial denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min, 40 amplification cycles [denaturation at 95 °C for 10 s, annealing at 56 °C for 30 s, and elongation at 72 °C for 30 s], followed by one cycle at 72 °C for 5 min. The iQ
 <sup>TM</sup>5 optical system software (Bio-Rad) was used for data analysis. Here, β-actin which is well-known as a housekeeping gene was considered as a normalization control. Oligonucleotide primers used for real-time RT-PCR analysis are shown in
