<p>The obtained parasitological results demonstrated the exceptional anti-
 <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> effects of MCEO, so that the mean number of 
 <italic>T. gondii</italic> tissue cysts in experimental groups of Ex1 (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), Ex2 (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), and Ex3 (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) was meaningfully reduced in a dose-dependent manner compared with the control group (C2). The results also exhibited that the mean diameter of tissue cyst was significantly reduced in mice of experimental groups Ex2 (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) and Ex3 (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001).
