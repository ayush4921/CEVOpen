<p>Considering the antiparasitic activity of 
 <italic>M. communis,</italic> Mahmoudvand et al. (2015) have demonstrated that the essential oil and methanolic extract of 
 <italic>M. communis</italic> significantly suppressed the growth percentage of promastigote and amastigote forms of 
 <italic>Leishmania tropica</italic> with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranging from 8.4 to 40.8 μg/mL [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-26-00819" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In the other study conducted by Azadbakht et al. (2004), the results showed that essential oil and methanolic extract of 
 <italic>M. communis</italic> at the concentrations of 0.0001 to 0.1 considerably reduced the growth rate of 
 <italic>Trichomonas vaginalis</italic> trophozoites on in vitro experiments [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-26-00819" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The results of another study showed that MCEO at the dose of 12.5 to 100 μg/mL significantly reduced the viability of protoscoleces of 
 <italic>Echinococcus granulosus</italic> in vitro [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-26-00819" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The anti-plasmodial effects of methanolic extract of 
 <italic>M. communis</italic> were demonstrated against chloroquine-resistant (K1) and chloroquine-sensitive (3D7) strains of 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 35.44 and 0.87 µg/mL, respectively [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-26-00819" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]; the authors also concluded that 
 <italic>M. communis</italic> methanolic extract considerably reduced the parasitemia in mice infected with 
 <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> after 4 days of treatment.
