<p>Since one of the most important mechanisms of control of toxoplasmosis is the immune system, mainly cellular immunity, we evaluated the mRNA levels of some innate immunity mediators such as IFN-γ and IL12 by quantitative real time PCR [

The results demonstrated that although the mRNA levels of IFN-γ and IL-12 were elevated in all mice of experimental groups, a significant increase was observed in mice treated by MCEO at the doses of Ex2 and Ex3 of MCEO when compared with control groups. With respect to the immunomodulatory effects, it has been proven that cytokine IL-12 controls nitric oxide synthesis via IFN-γ. In 
 <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection, the production of nitric oxide is controlled by the partial inhibition of the synthesis of nitric oxide synthetase. Theoretically, modulation of cytokine is extremely important, because nitric oxide is considered as a part of the initial effectors in the immune system response against toxoplasmosis [

Our findings suggest that the decrease in parasite load in the infected mice treated with MCEO can be associated to the strengthening of the immune system, principally the innate immune system, of the tested mice that result in the control of 
 <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection. Considering the toxicity of MCEO, in the study conducted by Mahmoudvand et al. (2016), the results showed that there was no significant toxicity in the clinical chemistry and hematological parameters after 14 days of oral administration of MCEO at the doses 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 mL/kg in tested mice, indicating that MCEO at the tested doses of the present study has no toxicity in BALB/c mice [
