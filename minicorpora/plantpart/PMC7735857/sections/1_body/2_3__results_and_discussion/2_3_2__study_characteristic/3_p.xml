<p>In vivo models of inflammation included dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) induced intestinal inflammation, TPA-induced mouse skin inflammation, carrageenan-induced paw oedema, xylene-induced ear oedema model, 2, 4-dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB)-induced allergic contact dermatitis (ACD), and ischaemic renal rat models. A number of experimental methods were used in the in vivo experiments, including the acetic acid-induced writhing test, oxytocin-induced dysmenorrhea in mice, formalin test, complete Freund's adjuvant-induced overt pain test, carrageenan-induced mechanical hyperalgesia test, evaluation of cytokine levels by ELISAs, and western blot analysis. Through the aforementioned experimental methods, it was further shown that Chinese traditional medicine essential oils have obvious attenuating effects on various kinds of inflammation.</p>
