<p>The essential oil from 
 <italic>Artemisia argyi</italic> (AAEO) [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] can inhibit the release of inflammatory mediators (NO and PGE2) and the expression of cytokines (IL-6, IFN-
 <italic>Î²</italic>, IL-10, and MCP-1). AAEO inhibited the expression of iNOS and COX-2 at the transcription level without affecting its activity [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Moreover, AAEO also inhibited the phosphorylation of STAT1 (Tyr701) and STAT3 (Tyr705) and downregulated JAK/STAT signalling and ROS scavenging. ROS production plays a key role in the activation of JAK/STATs in macrophages. According to a previous report, essential oils scavenging ROS have antioxidant activity; therefore, the inhibitory effect of AAEO on JAK/STAT may be due to its antioxidant activity, especially its effect on ROS production [
