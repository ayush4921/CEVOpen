<p>The essential oil from

 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], 3-carene, and limonene, [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] can inhibit the inflammatory cell infiltration induced caused by noxious stimuli [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. They have a significant pharmacological effect on the migration of RAW264.7 macrophages induced by LPS and inhibit COX-2 overexpression [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Because of its good permeability and anti-inflammatory properties, GPEO is a great treatment for relieving skin redness or treating poisonous insect bites.
