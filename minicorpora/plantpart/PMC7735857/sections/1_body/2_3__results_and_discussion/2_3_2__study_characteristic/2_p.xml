<p>In vitro experiments were performed in human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs), a human keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT), the THP-1 cell line, mouse primary splenocytes and peritoneal macrophages, RAW264.7 cells, and ANA-1 cells. Many in vitro experimental methods were reported in the articles, including immunohistochemical analysis, apoptosis assay, and histological assessment, and proinflammatory cytokines were quantitatively measured by ELISAs, with western blotting and RT-PCR used to detect the expression of various proteins and mRNA, respectively.</p>
