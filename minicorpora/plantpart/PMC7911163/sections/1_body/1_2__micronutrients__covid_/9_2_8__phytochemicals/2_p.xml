<p>With respect to PAF, resveratrol and tyrosol as well as their acetylated derivatives inhibit PAF induced platelet aggregation [
 <xref rid="B138-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>] while curcumin is a PAF inhibitor [
 <xref rid="B139-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>] and plays a role in thrombosis and coagulation [
 <xref rid="B140-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>,
 <xref rid="B141-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>]. Moreover, curcumin and phenolic compounds acting as antioxidants can modulate LDL oxidation [
 <xref rid="B130-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>] and the subsequent production of PAF and PAF-like lipids [
 <xref rid="B22-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Their effect could be also directly exerted on PAF biosynthetic enzymes as demonstrated by in vitro studies. Indeed, resveratrol and quercetin can inhibit both PAF’s main biosynthetic enzymes in vitro [

 <xref rid="B143-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>], phenolic compounds reduce the activity of PAF biosynthetic enzymes in cell cultures stimulated with IL-1β [
 <xref rid="B144-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>] and flavonoids, have been documented to reduce lyso-PAF acetyltransferase activity [
 <xref rid="B145-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>]. More particularly, pro-anthocyanidins [
 <xref rid="B146-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>], luteolin [
 <xref rid="B145-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>], quercetin [
 <xref rid="B80-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>,
 <xref rid="B147-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>], hesperidin [
 <xref rid="B147-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>] and naringin [
 <xref rid="B147-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>] reduce the activity of lyso-PAF acetyltransferase in cell lines. Licoricidin and other components were also documented to inhibit lyso-PAF acetyltransferase [
 <xref rid="B148-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>]. Moreover, the antioxidant capacity of the diet, which is at least in part affected by phytochemical intake, was inversely related with PAF levels and the activity of lyso-PAF-acetyltransferase in healthy volunteers as evidenced by our group [
 <xref rid="B34-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In parallel, PAF has been inversely related to antioxidant-rich foods (herbal drinks and coffee) [
 <xref rid="B34-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Lignans, which have been proposed as an anti-COVID compound [
 <xref rid="B137-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>] are also PAF inhibitors [
 <xref rid="B149-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>]. Thus, the effects of flavonoids and other phytochemicals on PAF levels, actions, and its metabolic enzymes generate the hypothesis that their anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic actions are at least in part mediated by the PAF circuit.
