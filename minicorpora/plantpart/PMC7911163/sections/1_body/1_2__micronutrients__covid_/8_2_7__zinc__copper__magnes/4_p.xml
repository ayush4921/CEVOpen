<p>The interrelation between PAF and zinc, copper and magnesium is not very clear. A low zinc diet reduces platelet aggregation suggesting a role of this nutrient in hemostasis [
 <xref rid="B123-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>], while zinc and copper chelate complexes have a PAF inhibitory activity mainly attributed to stereochemical interactions [

 <xref rid="B125-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. Chelating agents such as Mg

 <xref rid="B23-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. It is noted that metal- induced oxidative stress in the presence of superoxide can inactivate PAF acetylhydrolase [
 <xref rid="B127-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>] and thus potentially increase PAF levels. In addition, macrophage responsiveness to PAF is altered by interferon [
 <xref rid="B128-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>] and provides protection against PAF induced injury [
 <xref rid="B129-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>], which may reflect an indirect connection of some minerals with PAF through interferon.
