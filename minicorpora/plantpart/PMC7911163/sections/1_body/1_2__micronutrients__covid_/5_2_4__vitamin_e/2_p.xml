<p>Vitamin E deficiency is connected to increased PAF synthesis in rat polynuclear cells [
 <xref rid="B75-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Moreover, vitamin E inhibits PAF induced platelet aggregation [

 <xref rid="B77-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>,
 <xref rid="B78-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>] and PAF synthesis [
 <xref rid="B79-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. In addition, lycopene alone or in combination with a-tocopherol reduces PAF synthesis in stimulated endothelial cells [
 <xref rid="B80-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>], which can further blunt the inflammatory cataract. Vitamin E and increased Lp-PLA
 <sub>2</sub> have been associated with decreased asthma development [
 <xref rid="B81-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>], and the vitamin may indirectly affect Lp-PLA
 <sub>2</sub> since it improves LDL quality, in which the enzyme is attached [
 <xref rid="B82-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. However, high levels of vitamin E ingested as a supplement (1500 IU for two weeks) seem not to influence the concentration of lyso-PAF [
 <xref rid="B83-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. In total, vitamin E can affect PAF levels, metabolism and its actions on platelets, i.e., the pro-thrombotic state.
