<p>Omega-3 fatty acids also exert antithrombotic effects by various mechanisms including a reduction in thromboxane synthesis [
 <xref rid="B99-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>] and PAF [
 <xref rid="B100-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>,
 <xref rid="B101-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. Omega-3 fatty acids are incorporated in the cell membrane and may regulate the activity of PLA
 <sub>2</sub> and thus lyso-PAF production, which is a prodrome molecule for PAF production [
 <xref rid="B102-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. DHA inhibits PAF increase in cell lines [
 <xref rid="B103-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. Moreover, omega-3 can reduce PAF production in Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC) [
 <xref rid="B101-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. In cases of endotoxemia, which is also observed in seriously ill COVID-19 patients [
 <xref rid="B104-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>], linolenic acid has been found to reduce PAF production in Sprague-Dawley rats [
 <xref rid="B105-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. In addition, a diet rich in fish oils (10%) has been found to reduce PAF and LTB
 <sub>4</sub> [
 <xref rid="B106-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. As far as PAF enzymes are concerned, a negative association has been documented between the PAF catabolic enzyme Lp-PLA
 <sub>2</sub> and adipose tissue omega-3 fatty acids [
 <xref rid="B107-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>] while the effects of supplementation did not change the enzymeâ€™s activity in healthy adults [
 <xref rid="B108-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>] but decreased the enzyme in volunteers with stable angina [
 <xref rid="B109-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>] and hypertriglyceridemia [
 <xref rid="B110-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. It is noted that Lp-PLA
 <sub>2</sub>, increases as a result of increased PAF in order to catabolize it, thus, the trend for an inverse association of Lp-PLA
 <sub>2</sub> with omega-3 fatty acids, implies a negative association with PAF. Moreover, results from a cross-sectional study of our group have shown that omega-6 fatty acids were positively correlated with PAF-CPT while no significant correlations were observed with omega-3 fatty acids and PAF or its enzymes [
