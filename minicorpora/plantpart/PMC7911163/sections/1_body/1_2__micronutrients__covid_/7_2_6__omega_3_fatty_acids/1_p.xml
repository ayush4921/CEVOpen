<p>Omega-3 fatty acids have anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic effects [

 <xref rid="B94-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. The results from animal studies show that mice with Klebsiella pneumoniae or Streptococcus pneumoniae had an upregulated immune defense and less bacterial burden when fed omega-3 fatty acids [
