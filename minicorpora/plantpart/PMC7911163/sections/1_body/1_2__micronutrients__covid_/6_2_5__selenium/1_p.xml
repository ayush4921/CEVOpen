<p>Selenium has been proposed to potentially play a role in COVID-19 prevention, since in the form of sodium selenite it can oxidize thiol groups in the virus protein disulfide isomerase and thus inhibit the entrance viruses into the cell [
 <xref rid="B84-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. It also has an antioxidant role since it is a structural component of glutathione peroxidases, a family of antioxidant enzymes [

 <xref rid="B65-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Moreover, good selenium status, as assessed by the selenium hair content, has been connected to a higher recovery rate from COVID-19 [
