<p>The relationship between selenium and PAF can be considered under the prism of the effects of selenium on oxidative stress and phospholipid metabolism. Firstly, the modulation of oxidative stress by selenium could affect PAF metabolism, as for example it deactivates Lp-PLA
 <sub>2</sub> [

 <xref rid="B54-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Secondly, selenoprotein I is implicated in phospholipid biosynthesis [
 <xref rid="B85-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Moreover, PAF production is increased in the case of selenium deficiency in endothelial cells [
 <xref rid="B90-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>,
 <xref rid="B91-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>] possibly through activation of its biosynthetic enzyme lyso-PAF-acetyltransferase [
 <xref rid="B90-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. It is noted that the content of diet in selenium did not alter Lp-PLA
 <sub>2</sub> in rats [
 <xref rid="B92-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>], while selenium deficiency is associated with arterial thrombosis and selenium seems to decrease platelet aggregation [
 <xref rid="B93-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. It can be thus hypothesized that worse outcomes of COVID-19 on the grounds of selenium deficiency may be at least in part attributed to increased PAF and an associated pro-thrombotic state.
