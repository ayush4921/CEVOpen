<p>Retinoic acid can modulate the gene expression of PAF-receptor [
 <xref rid="B42-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and acts synergistically with PAF to activate the inducible prostaglandin synthase gene [
 <xref rid="B43-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Prostaglandins synthesis contributes to gastric mucosal defense, although different effects are attributed to the many kinds of prostaglandins [

 <sub>2</sub> in epidemiological studies [
 <xref rid="B45-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The interplay of vitamin A and PAF in immunity is also highlighted by the fact that the host-versus- graft reaction, in which PAF is implicated [
 <xref rid="B46-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], is enhanced by high levels of vitamin A (34).
