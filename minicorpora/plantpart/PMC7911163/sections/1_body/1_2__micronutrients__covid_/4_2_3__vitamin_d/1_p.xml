<p>Vitamin D exerts antimicrobial and anti-oxidant effects and supports the immune system against respiratory infection [
 <xref rid="B58-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. According to a meta-analysis vitamin D supplementation reduces the risk of acute respiratory infections [
 <xref rid="B59-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], has been inversely related to hepatitis viral load [
 <xref rid="B60-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] and improves antibacterial immunity in HIV-1 patients [
 <xref rid="B61-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. An inverse association between mean levels of vitamin D and the number of COVID-19 cases/1 M was recently reported in a cross-sectional European study [
 <xref rid="B62-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] whereas a UK study did not find an association between the vitaminâ€™s status and COVID-19 risk [
 <xref rid="B63-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Moreover, low levels of vitamin D were found in COVID-19 positive patients [
 <xref rid="B64-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] or hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="B65-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] and have been connected to the severity of the disease. The hypothesis that vitamin D may explain susceptibility to COVID-19 infection in dark colored skin individuals does not seem to be valid [
 <xref rid="B63-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. It is noteworthy that several clinical trials are on the way regarding the role of vitamin D in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19, reviewed elsewhere [
