<p>In vitro data suggest that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 reduces the secretion of the catabolic enzyme PAF-AH from placenta macrophages [

Moreover, paricalcitol has an anti-inflammatory and anti-PAF action in hemodialysis patients inhibiting PAF/thrombin-induced platelet aggregation, reducing the activity of PAF biosynthetic enzymes and increasing the activity of the catabolic enzyme of PAF, i.e., PAF-AH [
