<p>In addition, vitamin C decreased markers of thrombosis, such as tissue plasminogen activator and von Willebrand factor in high risk patients with cardiovascular disease and diabetes [

 <xref rid="B47-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], which is a strong trigger for synthesis of PAF [
 <xref rid="B54-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] and its receptor [

 <xref rid="B56-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] the PAF catabolic enzyme Lp-PLA
 <sub>2</sub> is increased (suggesting its upregulation to counter-balance PAF levels) while anti-oxidant status is decreased (vitamin C, E, Î±-tocopherol, biological anti-oxidant potential, and total thiol levels) [
 <xref rid="B57-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Vitamin C status could thus affect the inflammatory and micro-thrombotic environment including PAF and the morbidity of COVID-19.
