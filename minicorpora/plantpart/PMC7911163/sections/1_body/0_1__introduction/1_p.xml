<p>The new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is an emerging situation with high rates of infectivity, morbidity and mortality [
 <xref rid="B1-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The pathophysiology of the disease involves a cytokine storm and the activation of thrombotic pathways [
 <xref rid="B2-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It was recently documented in Wuhan, China, that the disease is directly connected to the nutritional status of severely and critically ill patients [
 <xref rid="B3-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Although “there is no diet to prevent coronavirus” [
 <xref rid="B4-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and there are limited applied clinical nutrition protocols for COVID-19 patients [
 <xref rid="B5-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], the focus of the international community shifts to recommending a healthy dietary pattern [
 <xref rid="B8-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], intended to control inflammation and thrombosis, which accompany the syndromes’ complications [
 <xref rid="B2-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Indeed, a well-balanced diet ensures the proper functioning of the immune system [
 <xref rid="B4-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and several micro-constituents alone or as part of a healthy dietary pattern, such as the Mediterranean diet, play a role in viral infections [
 <xref rid="B9-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], inflammation [
 <xref rid="B10-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and thrombosis [
 <xref rid="B11-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. A key molecule implicated in COVID-19 pathology is platelet activating factor (PAF), as recently highlighted by our group [
 <xref rid="B2-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. More particularly, PAF is a glyceryl-ether phospholipid (1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-
 <italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-phosphocholine) [
 <xref rid="B14-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], which is a potent mediator of inflammation and thrombosis [
 <xref rid="B15-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. It is produced by various cells such as platelets, endothelial cells, macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils and other cells continuously or upon inflammatory stimuli [
 <xref rid="B15-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. It is noted that the main biosynthetic enzymes of PAF are lyso-PAF-acetyltransferases and dithiothreitol-insensitive CDP-choline: 1-alkyl-2-acetyl-
 <italic>sn</italic>-glycerol cholinephosphotransferase (PAF-CPT). PAF is catabolized by PAF acetylhydrolase or lipoprotein associated phospholipase A
 <sub>2</sub> (Lp-PLA
 <sub>2</sub>) [
 <xref rid="B15-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. PAF levels, PAF induced platelet aggregation and the activity of its metabolic enzymes correlate with various clinical states such as asthma, stroke, atherosclerosis, heart failure, cancer, kidney disease and viral diseases [
 <xref rid="B9-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
