<p>The inhibitors of PAF found in natural products and microconstituents of the diet are of increasing interest [

 <xref rid="B34-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In fact, diet can directly affect PAF induced platelet aggregation, PAF levels and/or the activity and expression of PAF metabolic enzymes [
 <xref rid="B35-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] or it can act indirectly by modifying its environment (i.e., oxidative stress) [
 <xref rid="B23-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Furthermore, the modulation of PAF by dietary parameters has been shown to affect the manifestation of disease [
 <xref rid="B36-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Given the newly suggested role of PAF and its dietary inhibitors in relation to the COVID-19 epidemic in limited works [
 <xref rid="B2-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B37-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], the scope of the present mini-review is to thoroughly present the potential anti-PAF actions of nutrients providing “protection” against COVID-19. We further suggest that the well-known anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic actions of micronutrients, phytochemicals and/or holistic dietary schemes are also mediated through PAF.
