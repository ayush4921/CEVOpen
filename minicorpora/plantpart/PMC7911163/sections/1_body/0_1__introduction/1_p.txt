0: The new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is an emerging situation with high rates of infectivity, morbidity and mortality [ 1].
1: The pathophysiology of the disease involves a cytokine storm and the activation of thrombotic pathways [ 2].
2: It was recently documented in Wuhan, China, that the disease is directly connected to the nutritional status of severely and critically ill patients [ 3].
3: Although there is no diet to prevent coronavirus [ 4] and there are limited applied clinical nutrition protocols for COVID-19 patients [ 5, 6, 7], the focus of the international community shifts to recommending a healthy dietary pattern [ 8], intended to control inflammation and thrombosis, which accompany the syndromes complications [ 2].
4: Indeed, a well-balanced diet ensures the proper functioning of the immune system [ 4] and several micro-constituents alone or as part of a healthy dietary pattern, such as the Mediterranean diet, play a role in viral infections [ 9], inflammation [ 10] and thrombosis [ 11, 12].
5: A key molecule implicated in COVID-19 pathology is platelet activating factor (PAF), as recently highlighted by our group [ 2, 13].
6: More particularly, PAF is a glyceryl-ether phospholipid (1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl- sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) [ 14], which is a potent mediator of inflammation and thrombosis [ 15, 16].
7: It is produced by various cells such as platelets, endothelial cells, macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils and other cells continuously or upon inflammatory stimuli [ 15].
8: It is noted that the main biosynthetic enzymes of PAF are lyso-PAF-acetyltransferases and dithiothreitol-insensitive CDP-choline: 1-alkyl-2-acetyl- sn-glycerol cholinephosphotransferase (PAF-CPT).
9: PAF is catabolized by PAF acetylhydrolase or lipoprotein associated phospholipase A 2 (Lp-PLA 2) [ 15].
10: PAF levels, PAF induced platelet aggregation and the activity of its metabolic enzymes correlate with various clinical states such as asthma, stroke, atherosclerosis, heart failure, cancer, kidney disease and viral diseases [ 9, 15, 17].
