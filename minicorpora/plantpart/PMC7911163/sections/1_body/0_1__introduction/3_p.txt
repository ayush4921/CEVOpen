0: The inhibitors of PAF found in natural products and microconstituents of the diet are of increasing interest [ 11, 34].
1: In fact, diet can directly affect PAF induced platelet aggregation, PAF levels and/or the activity and expression of PAF metabolic enzymes [ 35] or it can act indirectly by modifying its environment (i.e., oxidative stress) [ 23].
2: Furthermore, the modulation of PAF by dietary parameters has been shown to affect the manifestation of disease [ 36].
3: Given the newly suggested role of PAF and its dietary inhibitors in relation to the COVID-19 epidemic in limited works [ 2, 10, 13, 37], the scope of the present mini-review is to thoroughly present the potential anti-PAF actions of nutrients providing protection against COVID-19.
4: We further suggest that the well-known anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic actions of micronutrients, phytochemicals and/or holistic dietary schemes are also mediated through PAF.
