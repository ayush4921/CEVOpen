0: With respect to COVID-19, PAF is a highly pyrogenic agent [ 18] and it affects the activity of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [ 19], which is used as a receptor to facilitate the entrance of SARS-CoV-2 into the cells [ 20].
1: According to a lipidomic analysis human cells infected with the coronavirus HCoV-229E are enriched in PAF [ 21].
2: Moreover, oxidized phospholipids, which contain PAF and PAF-like lipids [ 22, 23] have been detected in the respiratory system of patients with SARS-CoV-1 and seem to increase cytokine production and lung injury via Toll-like receptor (TLR)4 [ 24].
3: Another similarity between the phenotypic manifestations of COVID-19 and PAF actions is that they are both connected to Kawasaki-like disease in children [ 25].
4: PAF has been also found to increase phagocytic capacity in equine alveolar macrophages [ 26] and its levels are increased in acute pulmonary disease [ 27], pulmonary hypertension [ 28] and sepsis [ 29].
5: Interestingly, the first-line drugs used in the COVID-19 epidemic, such as chloroquine have been also found to reduce PAF induced pulmonary edema [ 30].
6: Hopefully, specific inhibitors such as rupatadine can modulate the action of PAF [ 31] and they have been proposed as potential candidate therapeutic compounds against COVID-19 [ 13].
7: Inversely, widely prescribed medicines, such as statins or antiretroviral drugs with pleiotropic actions also influence PAF [ 32, 33].
