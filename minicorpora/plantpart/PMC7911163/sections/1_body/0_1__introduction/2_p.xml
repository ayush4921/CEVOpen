<p>With respect to COVID-19, PAF is a highly pyrogenic agent [
 <xref rid="B18-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and it affects the activity of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [
 <xref rid="B19-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], which is used as a receptor to facilitate the entrance of SARS-CoV-2 into the cells [
 <xref rid="B20-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. According to a lipidomic analysis human cells infected with the coronavirus HCoV-229E are enriched in PAF [
 <xref rid="B21-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Moreover, oxidized phospholipids, which contain PAF and PAF-like lipids [
 <xref rid="B22-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] have been detected in the respiratory system of patients with SARS-CoV-1 and seem to increase cytokine production and lung injury via Toll-like receptor (TLR)4 [
 <xref rid="B24-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Another similarity between the phenotypic manifestations of COVID-19 and PAF actions is that they are both connected to Kawasaki-like disease in children [
 <xref rid="B25-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. PAF has been also found to increase phagocytic capacity in equine alveolar macrophages [
 <xref rid="B26-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and its levels are increased in acute pulmonary disease [
 <xref rid="B27-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], pulmonary hypertension [
 <xref rid="B28-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and sepsis [
 <xref rid="B29-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Interestingly, the first-line drugs used in the COVID-19 epidemic, such as chloroquine have been also found to reduce PAF induced pulmonary edema [
 <xref rid="B30-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Hopefully, specific inhibitors such as rupatadine can modulate the action of PAF [
 <xref rid="B31-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and they have been proposed as potential candidate therapeutic compounds against COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="B13-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Inversely, widely prescribed medicines, such as statins or antiretroviral drugs with pleiotropic actions also influence PAF [
 <xref rid="B32-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="B33-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].
