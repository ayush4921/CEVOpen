<p>Olive oil contains monounsaturated fatty acids and several microconstituents with antioxidant and anti-thrombotic action, such as polyphenols [

 <xref rid="B160-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>], and bioactive compounds have also been found in olive oil pomace and its byproducts [
 <xref rid="B161-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>]. From in vitro data it has been shown that olive oil polar lipids inhibit PAF-CPT which is a biosynthetic enzyme for PAF [
