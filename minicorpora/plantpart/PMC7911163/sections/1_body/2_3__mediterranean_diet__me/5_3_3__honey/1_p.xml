<p>Detailed nutritional records of Cretan participants of the Seven Countries Study, highlight the presence of honey in their every-day diet [
 <xref rid="B169-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">169</xref>] and Plato considered honey an essential component of a healthy diet [
 <xref rid="B170-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">170</xref>]. Indeed, stingless bee honey has been found to inhibit TNF-α, IL-6 and interferon secretion from stimulated macrophages [
 <xref rid="B171-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">171</xref>] and to reduce inflammation in animal models [
 <xref rid="B172-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">172</xref>]. Honey has anti-bacterial properties due to its content of phenolic compounds, the production of hydrogen peroxide and other mechanisms such as osmosis [
 <xref rid="B173-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">173</xref>]. Moreover, it has been suggested to have a role against COVID-19 epidemic [
 <xref rid="B174-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">174</xref>,
 <xref rid="B175-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">175</xref>], it has six compounds related to the receptor active site of COVID-19’s main protease according to a in silico approach [
 <xref rid="B176-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">176</xref>] and is currently being tested in a clinical trial (clinical trial NCT04323345) [
 <xref rid="B176-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">176</xref>]. It is noted that honey displays anti-thrombotic activity [
 <xref rid="B177-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">177</xref>] and it especially acts as a PAF inhibitor [
 <xref rid="B178-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">178</xref>]. In total, the anti-bacterial, the anti-thrombotic and anti-PAF effects of honey render it a potentially useful food against the COVID epidemic.
