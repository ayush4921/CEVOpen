<p>Fish have anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic properties, and they exert beneficial effects in the respiratory tract (see also omega-3 fatty acids) [

 <xref rid="B164-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">164</xref>] attributed to polar lipids, neutral lipids [
 <xref rid="B165-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">165</xref>] and other lipids, such as gangliosides [
 <xref rid="B166-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">166</xref>]. Moreover, from in vitro data it has been shown that fish polar lipids inhibit PAF-CPT [
 <xref rid="B142-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>]. Fish polar lipids retard atherosclerosis in rabbits by down-regulating PAF biosynthesis and up-regulating PAF catabolism [
 <xref rid="B167-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">167</xref>]. Interestingly, the antibacterial properties of fish go hand in hand with their anti-PAF activity, suggesting that PAF antagonists and agonists in fish may also have antibacterial activity [
