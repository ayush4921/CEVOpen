<p>Plant foods with antiviral properties have been recently reviewed as anti-COVID agents, as they prevent viral replication, enhance antibody production against influenza virus, and improve T-cell function [
 <xref rid="B159-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>]. A recent work reported the inhibition of COVID-19 with the use of molecular docking by plant terpenoids, such as Ginkgolide A [
 <xref rid="B186-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">186</xref>], which is also one of the most potent PAF inhibitors [

 <xref rid="B188-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">188</xref>] also contain PAF inhibitors [

 <xref rid="B190-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">190</xref>]. Moreover, wild greens, which are rich in polyphenols have a postprandial anti-PAF effect [

 <xref rid="B188-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">188</xref>] may also be implicated in COVID-19, since rice bran policosanol extract has anti-aggregatory activity (although studies have researched only ADP-induced platelet aggregation and not PAF as an aggregatory agent) [
 <xref rid="B192-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">192</xref>]. In addition, rice policosanol has been found to activate the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2) pathway[
 <xref rid="B193-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">193</xref>], a molecular pathway playing a role in combating COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="B194-nutrients-13-00462" ref-type="bibr">194</xref>], which can also modulate PAF-acetylhydrolase transcription [
