 <caption> Components of essential oils influenced by soil type. When coefficients tend to zero for the land model (calcareous, siliceous, schist, or alluvial), other terpenes are highlighted ( Figure 8). The “Mediterranean maquis” ecosystem stimulates emanation of aromas and odors that are able to attract insects or other organisms, which can carry pollen from other plants, or nursing animals that help to disperse seeds over a wide area in a very competitive environment full of fragrant wild flowers ( Figure 9). </caption>
