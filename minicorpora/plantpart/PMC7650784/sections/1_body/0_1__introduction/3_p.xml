<p>The chemical components of the essential oils obtained from all tissues of the plant determine the antioxidant, antibiotic, and antimutagenic properties of the Myrtle biomass [

It is known that intraspecific variability and environmental conditions can significantly influence the qualitative and quantitative levels of major compounds of essential oils that characterize a plant species. Based on the aim of selecting a commercially exploitable cultivar, considerable effort has been dedicated to collecting wild plants (with good qualitative and quantitative production) around all Sardinia, and to their agamic propagation. Candidate clone-lines in this first mass-selection step were planted in a comparison field, where the best genotypes were described, tested as cultivars, and proposed to the nursery market [

Another selection group (named “V” + code number) was obtained by open pollination of some previously selected candidate clones, sowing of the hybrids, transplanting a lot of seedlings in a plot, and after some years, the selection of new candidate clones by agamic propagation in a new plot (
