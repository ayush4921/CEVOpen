<p>Comparison of the last two statistical analyses made it possible, based on the model, to establish variables that best characterized accessions, in relation to the land from which they were collected and to the ecosystem in which they evolved over time. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01288-f007">Figure 7</xref> shows a comparison between the two models mentioned above, the “land” model (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01288-f006">Figure 6</xref>), taking into account the correlation coefficients Pcor. If the ratio between variables in the two models is &gt;3, a particular significance for the higher Pcor model is suggested.
