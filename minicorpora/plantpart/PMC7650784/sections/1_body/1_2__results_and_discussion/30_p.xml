 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01288-f011">Figure 11</xref> show the relative OPLS-DA. The score plot related to the OPSL-DA was calculated using a productivity variable as a discriminant. It is possible to observe a division of accessions into three distinct groups, even if not well defined. The group of plants with average productivity was very well defined, which was also the most representative numerically. Groups with medium-high and high productions were quite distinct from each other, even if there were approaches and intersections between a few accessions, while the low-productivity group diffused randomly on the left part of score plot (
