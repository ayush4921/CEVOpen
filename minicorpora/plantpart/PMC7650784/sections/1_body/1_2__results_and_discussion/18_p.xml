<p>This clear division into two groups led us to investigate the reason for this difference. One of the soundest reasons is that accessions from Rumanedda belong to very ancient and virgin Mediterranean flora on which anthropic pressure has not been applied. This has allowed the ecosystem to conserve a marked biodiversity so that plants from Myrtle have the opportunity to diversify into numerous genotypes. Moreover, this group was extensively used as the mother genotypes in the open pollination test, which produced new hybrid selections of the V group. This reflects on the composition of essential oils, and discriminatory analysis clearly highlights the groups Rumanedda and V as compared to all other accessions coming from the territory of Sardinia.</p>
