<p>The selections based on alluvial soil were positioned close to the prevailing composition of substrate. Consequently, accessions SBD2 and SBD1 coming from Muravera were very close to those coming from schist substrates and to those coming from Budoni (BUD), where soil has a schist nature, but were not very far in composition from the alluvial soil located further South along the same Eastern coast of Sardinia. The SAS selection, which comes from an alluvial soil near Sassari, but is native to Apulia where calcareous land is prevalent, showed a particular positioning. In this case, the model in relation to soil type can also predict the composition of essential oil from where the original plant was collected.</p>
