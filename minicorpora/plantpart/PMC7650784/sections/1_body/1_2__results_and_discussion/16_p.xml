<p>To check whether there were any differences in variables to classify samples and to create predictive models, we used OPLS-DA (Discriminant Analysis) analysis. Consequently, we tried to correlate the compositions of essential oils, derived from berries and leaves of accessions, with discrete variables such as the place of origin, mean rainfall per year, or to plant berry yield and plant vegetative vigor of the mother plant.</p>
