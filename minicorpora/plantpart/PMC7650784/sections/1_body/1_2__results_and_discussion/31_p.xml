<p>The score plot related to the discrete variable “vigor” shows how accessions gathered into three distinct groups, even if the three groups exclusively concerned vigorous plants: medium-high, medium, and low (which includes the medium-poor categories and medium-low). With regard to accessions that have a high vigor (there were only two), ORO2 and RUM3 did not group together and were randomly distributed in the score plot. </p>
