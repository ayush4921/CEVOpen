<p>To evaluate the predictive capacity, the generated model was validated by the leave-one-out cross-validation method. As a result, the predictive ability of these models (percentage of the objects belonging to the testing set correctly classified using the developed model) was &gt;97.7%, which revealed that this model was robust and permitted us to recognize differences arising in compositions from different places, rainfall, soil nature, ecosystem nature, fruit production, and plant vigor.</p>
