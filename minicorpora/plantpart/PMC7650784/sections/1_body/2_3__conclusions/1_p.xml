<p>Application of the orthogonal partial Latent Structure Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA) method to analytical data has proven to be very effective in constructing predictive models for Myrtle plants. Our results may contribute to understand the variability and quality of essential oils of this species, indicate the ideal places to collect wild plants, and devote to the cultivation and industrial production of essences and liqueurs. Furthermore, it is possible to have valid indications of the vigor and productivity of selected plants without having to carry out long-term cultivation experiments.</p>
