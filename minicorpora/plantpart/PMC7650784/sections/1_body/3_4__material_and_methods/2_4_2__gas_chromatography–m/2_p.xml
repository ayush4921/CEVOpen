 </bold>. MS analyses were carried out with an Agilent Technologies model 7820A connected to an MS detector 5977E MSD (Agilent), using the same conditions and column described above. The column was connected to a mass spectrometer ion source. Mass units were monitored from 10 to 900 AMU at 70 eV. For the identification procedure we considered only peaks from 40 to 900 AMU. Identification of constituents was based on comparisons of Kovatâ€™s index values and mass spectra with those obtained from the authentic samples and/or Nist and Wiley library spectra, or based on interpretation of the EI fragmentation of the molecules [
