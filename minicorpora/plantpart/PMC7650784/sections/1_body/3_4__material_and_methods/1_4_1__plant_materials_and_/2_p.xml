<p>To avoid harvesting an unrepresentative sample, we collected leaves from the entire plant, collecting material from the top, from the sides, and from the base in triplicate. In the laboratory, the plant material was cleaned of foreign parts (little branches, unripe fruits, residues of flowers), and samples were made as uniform as possible. From every cultivar, about 3 kg of leaves was collected and divided into three parts to replicate analyses. After harvest, clean leaves were kept in a freezer at −20 °C until extraction. Essential oil samples were obtained from leaves via hydrodistillation for 4 h using a Clevenger-type apparatus. For every selection three extractions were performed. Extraction yields were calculated as g·kg
 <sup>−1</sup> of fresh material. Oils were stored in sealed vials, at −20 °C, until chemical analysis.
