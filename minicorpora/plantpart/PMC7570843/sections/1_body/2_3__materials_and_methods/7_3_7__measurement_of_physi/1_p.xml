<p>Specific gravities and refractive indices of the essential oils extracted by VASFME at optimized condition were measured. Specific gravity was calculated by dividing the weight of 10 µL essential oil by that of 10 µL distilled water. The refractive index was measured 25 ± 2 °C using the Abbe’s refractometer (DR-A1, ATAGO USA Inc., Bellevue, WA 98005, USA).</p>
