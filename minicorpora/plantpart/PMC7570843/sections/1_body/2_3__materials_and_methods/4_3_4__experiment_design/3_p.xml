<p>A total of 13 different combinations, including 4 full factorial designs (±1) with 4 axial points (±1) and 5 replicates of the center point (coded 0), were investigated to fit the linear Equation (3) 
 <disp-formula>Y
  <sub>EO</sub> = β
  <sub>0</sub> + β
  <sub>1 × 1</sub> + β
  <sub>2</sub>X
  <sub>2</sub>

 </disp-formula> where, Y
 <sub>EO</sub> represents the response variable (essential oil yield and antimicrobial property in this study), β
 <sub>0</sub> is the regression coefficients of variables for intercept and β
 <sub>1</sub>, and β
 <sub>2</sub> are unknown variables. X
 <sub>1</sub> and X
 <sub>2</sub> are the independent coded variables influencing the response variable Y
 <sub>EO</sub>. The range of the studied parameters was chosen on the basis of a parametric study, and the results obtained from the CCD were analyzed statistically. The experiment design is shown in
