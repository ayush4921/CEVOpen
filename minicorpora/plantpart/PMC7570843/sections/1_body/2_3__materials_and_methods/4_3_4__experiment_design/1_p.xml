<p>A central composite design (CCD) was used to investigate the process with a minimal number of possible experiments. This multivariate study allows for the identification of interaction between variables and provides a complete exploration of the studied experiment domain. In this study, yield and antimicrobial activity were taken as responses. The type of CCD used in this study was central composite face centered (CCF). The levels of different process variables are given in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04072-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The application of a CCF design is a convenient way to optimize a three level process (âˆ’1, 0, +1) for each factor. The range of different process variables were taken as.
