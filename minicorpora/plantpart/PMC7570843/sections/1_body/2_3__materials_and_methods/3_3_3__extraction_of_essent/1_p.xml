<p>Solvent-free microwave extraction was performed in a microwave extractor as described by Bayramoglu, Sahin [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-25-04072" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. With the vacuum assisted solvent free microwave extraction (VASFME) process, a 400 g sample of fresh peels of sweet lime was placed in a flat bottom flask, and the apparatus was assembled as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04072-f002">Figure 2</xref>. The oil extracted from the sample by microwave radiation energy was cooled down in the condenser section. The condensate was channeled out into a separating funnel in order to separate the oil from the water, and a vacuum pump was installed to create suction pressure. In order to examine the process parameters, three different levels of microwave power (500, 750, 1000 W) and extraction time (20, 25, 30 min) were taken. The essential oils were collected, dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate and stored at 4 Â°C until used [
