<p>The antibacterial activity of the essential oils against 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> MTCC 42 (as an indicator microorganism) was determined using an agar well diffusion assay on nutrient agar plates as described by Ahmad and Beg [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-25-04072" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. One vial of 30% glycerol stock of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> was taken out and streaked in Luria Bertani (LB) agar plate. The plate was kept in 37

 <italic>E. coli</italic> from the plate was inoculated in 10 mL LB broth and kept in shaking condition at 37

Nutrient agar plates were seeded with 100 μL of overnight grown cultures of target strain and allowed to dry for 10 min. Subsequently, wells of diameter 8 mm were punched into the plates and loaded with 25 μL essential oil. Plates were incubated at 37
