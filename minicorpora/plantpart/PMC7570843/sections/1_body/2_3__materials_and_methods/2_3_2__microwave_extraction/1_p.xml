<p>Vacuum-assisted microwave extraction (VAME) was performed at atmospheric pressure with a microwave frequency of 2450 ± 50 MHz using a microwave extractor (TW/MWEX/2/17/18, Twin Engineers, Pimpri-Chinchwad, India) as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04072-f002">Figure 2</xref>. This is a multimode microwave reactor with a maximum power output of 1000 W. Microwave absorbing gaskets were used to minimize leakage. The microwave processing cavity dimensions were 900 × 900 × 600 mm (L × W × H). The adapter, condenser, separating funnel, vacuum pump etc. were attached to the extraction setup.
