<p>The ultrasound pre-treatment was performed in an ultrasonic bath (JSGW, Ambala, India) with a usable capacity of 2.5 L as well as a transducer in the base of the jug, operating at a frequency of 40 kHz and with a maximum input power of 100 W. In a flat bottom flask, sweet lime peels (400 g) with distilled water were placed into an ultrasound bath for 30, 60, 90 and 120 min. Water temperature of bath was maintained at 30 Â°C by replacing the water at regular interval. After ultrasonic treatment, the flask with sweet lime peels were taken for microwave extraction followed at the optimized condition and the essential oils yield was measured.</p>
