<p>The food processes resulting from exposure to ultrasound are believed to be affected in part by cavitation phenomena and mass transfer enhancement. The ultrasonic waves can cause a rapid series of alternative compressions and expansions in materials and result in the creation of microscopic channels. During continuous rarefaction and compression cycles, cavitation bubbles are produced and an increase in temperature and pressure occurs. This leads to a collapse of the bubble. A shock wave occurs in the solvent which causes greater penetration of the solvent into the plant materials, and more extraction takes place [
