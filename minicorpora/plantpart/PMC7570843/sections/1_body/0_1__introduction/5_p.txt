0: Microwave extraction is well known for selective and volumetric heating of the target, and it uses less solvent or no solvent, with less extraction time and a higher product quality.
1: In the microwave extraction process, microwave heating and distillation are combined as materials (e.g., plant materials) are subjected to extraction without the use of a solvent.
2: The glands and oleiferous receptacles of plant materials burst due to heating of in situ water which helps to free the essential oil along with production of water vapor.
3: The water vapor and essential oil condense and are collected in the receiving flask.
4: The water and essential oil layer can be easily separated and collected without the addition of any solvents [ 13].
5: Many researchers utilized citrus industry waste for extraction of essential oil by microwave extraction process and other methods [ 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18].
