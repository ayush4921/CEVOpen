<p>The majority of essential oils come from plant sources in which different methods of distillation or cold pressing are employed to extract peel oils from the citrus fruit. Steam distillation is the primary method used to extract essential oils from plant sources [

 <xref rid="B9-molecules-25-04072" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Distillation methods used very high temperature for extraction of desirable compounds. Essential oils molecules are very sensitive to heat due to its low boiling point and are thus vulnerable to chemical changes. As a result the extraction methods can lead to the loss of some volatile compounds and degradation of unsaturated or ester compounds through thermal effects [

 <xref rid="B11-molecules-25-04072" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These shortcomings have led to the consideration of the use of new techniques in essential oil extraction, which typically useless solvent or no solvent and less energy. New techniques such as supercritical fluid extraction, ultrasonic and microwave extraction have been found to have high potential of overcoming the drawbacks associated with other conventional methods [
