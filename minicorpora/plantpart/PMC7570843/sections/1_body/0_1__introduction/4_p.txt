0: The majority of essential oils come from plant sources in which different methods of distillation or cold pressing are employed to extract peel oils from the citrus fruit.
1: Steam distillation is the primary method used to extract essential oils from plant sources [ 7].
2: In addition, several other conventional methods such as soxhlet extraction, hydro-distillation and simultaneous distillation extraction are used to extract the essential oil [ 8, 9].
3: Distillation methods used very high temperature for extraction of desirable compounds.
4: Essential oils molecules are very sensitive to heat due to its low boiling point and are thus vulnerable to chemical changes.
5: As a result the extraction methods can lead to the loss of some volatile compounds and degradation of unsaturated or ester compounds through thermal effects [ 10].
6: Whereas, the use of petroleum-based solvents for essential oil extraction is characterized with high energy and time consumption, lower product yield, and generation of hazardous by products [ 11].
7: These shortcomings have led to the consideration of the use of new techniques in essential oil extraction, which typically useless solvent or no solvent and less energy.
8: New techniques such as supercritical fluid extraction, ultrasonic and microwave extraction have been found to have high potential of overcoming the drawbacks associated with other conventional methods [ 12].
