0: The food processes resulting from exposure to ultrasound are believed to be affected in part by cavitation phenomena and mass transfer enhancement.
1: The ultrasonic waves can cause a rapid series of alternative compressions and expansions in materials and result in the creation of microscopic channels.
2: During continuous rarefaction and compression cycles, cavitation bubbles are produced and an increase in temperature and pressure occurs.
3: This leads to a collapse of the bubble.
4: A shock wave occurs in the solvent which causes greater penetration of the solvent into the plant materials, and more extraction takes place [ 19].
