<p>Moisture content of the raw sweet lime peels and crude fat content of the dried peels were observed as 72.4 ± 0.12% and 1.6 ± 0.06%, respectively. The raw sweet lime peels were taken for the vacuum assisted microwave extraction (VASFME) process. Response surface methodology was used to determine the effect of microwave power (500–1000 W) (X
 <sub>1</sub>) and time of exposure (20–30 min) (X
 <sub>2</sub>) on essential oils yield and antimicrobial property. The range of microwave power and extraction time was selected based on different experimental trials. The results are shown in
