<p>The effects of microwave power and extraction time on essential oil yield using fresh sweet lime peel are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04072-f001">Figure 1</xref>a. Fresh samples of 400 g each were extracted with microwave power levels at 500–1000 W for 20–30 min. Both microwave power and extraction time had a significant effect on essential oil yield (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.01) (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04072-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The yield was obtained in the rage of 0.60 to 0.79 % on fresh peel weight basis. The current extraction efficiency was found high compared to the essential oils yield reported for orange peel (0.40 % dry basis in 30 min) using solvent-free microwave assisted extraction [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-25-04072" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. It has been observed that both microwave and extraction time have a positive effect on yield although the effect of microwave power is the greater of the two. The observed effect is same with results reported Auta, Musa [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-25-04072" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] for citrus peels essential oil extraction. They had reported yield of essential oil of 3.7% for orange and 2.5% lemon on dry weight basis. Increased power levels resulted in higher oil yield, but the quality of the oils degraded [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-25-04072" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This fact can be attributed to overheating, which leads to the degradation of heat-sensitive compounds [
