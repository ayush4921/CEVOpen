<p id="Par23">It can be seen from Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> that the aldehyde content is the largest in the VOCs, followed by alcohols. These two substances are the main sources of sweet cherry flower aroma. Benzaldehyde was detected in four sweet cherry cultivar flowers and hyacinth, citronella, cinnamon, iris and rose. Moreover, (
 <italic>E</italic>)-2-hexenal has a fresh green leaf fragrance and can be used as a blending fragrance for essential oils and various floral fragrances
 <sup>

 </sup>. Acetaldehyde is also present in the aroma of four sweet cherry cultivar flowers and naturally exists in round pomelo, pear, apple, raspberry, strawberry, pineapple, coffee, and orange juice
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>
 </sup>. After dilution, acetaldehyde has a fruity, coffee, wine, green fragrance. Benzaldehyde and benzeneacetaldehyde are important aldehyde flavor ingredients

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>
 </sup>, and benzaldehyde has the aroma of bitter almond, cherry and nut. Benzaldehyde, which is a common component of plant volatiles
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>
 </sup>, attracts many pest species. A recent study has indicated that benzaldehyde can be recognized by adult 
 <italic>A. lucorum</italic> and can affect its behavior
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>
 </sup>. Benzaldehyde is produced by enzymolysis of amygdalin in flowers, and the importance of this substance has been emphasized in previous studies

 </sup>. In this study, the concentrations of benzaldehyde and its derivative benzyl alcohol in the essential oil of the four sweet cherry cultivar flowers are relatively high, which shows the best fragrance of the flowers. This result confirms the importance of benzaldehyde to the sweet cherry flower aroma. Hexanal is a fatty acid that is produced under the catalytic action of lipoxygenase (LOX)
 <sup>

 </sup>. Hexanal has the fragrance of grass and can increase the perceived intensity of fruit aroma. Linalool and phenylethyl alcohol are important alcohol flavor ingredients, among which linalool is extensively applied in cosmetic flavors and food fruit flavors with antibacterial and antiviral effects. Phenylethyl alcohol is one of the two main aroma components of rose essential oil
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>
 </sup>. The fresh, sweet smell of phenylethyl has calming and soothing effects and anti-inflammatory and antibacterial effects. Lilac alcohol isomers (lilac alcohol B and lilac alcohol C) and lilac aldehyde isomers (lilac aldehyde B and lilac aldehyde C) in sweet cherry flowers are the characteristic aroma components. Most esters can impart plant fruit fragrance. 4-Methoxybenzoic acid ethyl ester is the main ester component of sweet cherry flowers, with aromas similar to fruits and anise. Among the olefins, beta-pinene, myrcene, trans-beta-ocimene, and β-ocimene are the main components, and beta-pinene is only detected in the Summit cultivar
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>
 </sup>. Ocimene has a certain role in the prevention and treatment of cancer. An antidepressant experiment in mice has also shown that ocimene can effectively reduce depression traits in mice
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>
 </sup>. Ethers and ketones are relatively rare in flowers. Ketones are also typical aromatic components, and 4-hydroxy-2-butanone is typical of sweet cherry flowers. These VOCs provide the unique aromatic quality of sweet cherry flowers, which indicates that sweet cherry flowers are an important natural spice raw material, which has important scientific value and excellent development prospects.
