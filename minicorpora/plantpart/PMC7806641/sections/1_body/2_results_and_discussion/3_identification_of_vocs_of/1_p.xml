<p id="Par19">The extraction of VOCs from samples is a key link in the analysis of aromatic components. In the past, solvent extraction was employed to extract aromatic compounds, but due to its defects, this method could not completely extract VOCs from the samples, which affects the accuracy of the analysis results

 </sup>. In this study, the HS-SPME was utilized to enrich the volatile and semivolatile components in the sample, combined with GC–MS technology to analyze, identify, and compare the aroma components of sweet cherry flower essential oil. This method offers high sensitivity and simple operation and is convenient and fast. The total ion chromatogram of the sweet cherry flower essential oils by HS-SPME/GC–MS separation analysis is shown in Fig.
