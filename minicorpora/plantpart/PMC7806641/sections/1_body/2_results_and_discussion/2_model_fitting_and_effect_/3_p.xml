 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a, as the liquid–solid ratio increased, the yield appears to increase and then decrease in certain microwave power conditions. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>e, in certain liquid–solid ratio conditions, with an increase in the microwave power, the yield also appears to increase and then decrease. In this case, A, C, A
 <sup>2</sup>, and C
 <sup>2</sup> are significant model terms, and B, AB, AC, BC, and B
 <sup>2</sup> are nonsignificant model terms. By the response surface analysis of the regression model, with the goal of maximizing the yield of sweet cherry flower essential oil, the optimal extraction conditions for UMAE are a liquid–solid ratio of 52.06 mL g
 <sup>−1</sup>, an extraction time of 26.83 min, and microwave power of 435.94 W. In these extraction conditions, the regression equation model predicts the yield of sweet cherry flower essential oil to be 1.24667%. Considering the feasibility of the actual operating conditions, the extraction condition parameters were revised to a liquid–solid ratio of 52 mL g
 <sup>−1</sup>, an extraction time of 27 min, and microwave power of 435 W. The actual yield of essential oils measured by 3 parallel experiments is 1.23%, which is near the predicted value and indicates that the regression equation model can better simulate and predict the yield of sweet cherry flower essential oils.
