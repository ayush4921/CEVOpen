<p id="Par11">According to the best process parameters obtained by optimizing the extraction of Brooks flower essential oil, Black Pearl, Tieton and Summit flower essential oils were extracted. After sampling, the 1 mL samples were immediately submitted to the HS-SPME/GC–MS system. Volatiles were isolated by SPME (50 °C), which included oscillation for 15 min and extraction for 30 min (250 RPM) using the CTC triad automatic sampler (Extractor head: 50/30 μm DVB/CAR on PDMS). Gas chromatography was performed on a DBwax (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 µm) to separate the volatile compounds at a constant flow of 1 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup> helium. The injection temperature was 260 °C. The temperatures of the column and ion source were 40 °C and 230 °C, respectively. The temperature-rise program was followed by an initial temperature of 5 °C for 5 min, 20 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup> with a maximum rate of 250 °C and then held constant for 2.5 min. Mass spectrometry (EI
 <sup>+</sup>, 70 eV) was determined by a full-scan method with a range from 200 to 400 (m z
 <sup>−1</sup>). The classification was referred from NIST 2014
