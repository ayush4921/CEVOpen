<p id="Par6">The 5.000 g flower sample of the Brooks sweet cherry cultivar was placed in a special flask for UMAE. Methanol:chloroform:ddH
 <sub>2</sub>O (5:2:2, v/v/v) mixed solution was added, and the flask was placed in the UMAE apparatus. The microwave extraction power was adjusted; the ultrasonic power was set to 50 W; the extraction time was set; the filter was vacuumed the filter residue was discarded; and then the collected extracting solution was poured into a rotary evaporator. The next step was to retrieve solvents by reduced pressure distillation, and the extracts were obtained at the same time.
