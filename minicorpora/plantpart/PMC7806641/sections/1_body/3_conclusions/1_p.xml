<p id="Par24">Ultrasound- and microwave-assisted extraction is an effective method that is suitable for the extraction of essential oil from sweet cherry flowers. Response surface methodology, as part of the experimental design and optimization, showed that the liquid–solid ratio and microwave power had a notable influence on the extraction yield. HS-SPME/GC–MS is an accurate, fast and effective method for determining the aromatic components of sweet cherry flower essential oil. The analysis results concluded that the detected VOCs in the Brooks, Black Pearl, Tieton and Summit sweet cherry cultivars were similar. However, significant variations in the contributions of these compounds to each cultivar were observed. Regardless of the cultivar, the most abundant alcohols and aldehyde compounds were ethanol and benzaldehyde, respectively. The principal volatiles were ethanol, linalool, lilac alcohol, acetaldehyde, (

These VOCs are the main sources of the aroma of sweet cherry flowers. Ethanol, linalool, 4-methoxy-benzaldehyde and lilac aldehyde have various biological activities. The research results provide a basis for the health benefits of sweet cherry flowers.
