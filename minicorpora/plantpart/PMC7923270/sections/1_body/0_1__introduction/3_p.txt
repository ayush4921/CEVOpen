0: During many pathological conditions and diseases processes such as age-related inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, asthma, atherosclerosis, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, ischemia/perfusion, diabetes, HIV and dementia [ 8], the cells of the body accumulate high levels of toxic reactive oxygen species (R.O.S.
1: )/free radicals in comparison to antioxidants [ 9].
2: This imbalance can cause significant damage to cell structures [ 9].
3: Antioxidants mitigate excessively produced reactive oxygen species within the cells, and in doing so, reduce the oxidative stress in cells [ 10].
4: Antioxidants may therefore have therapeutic applicability against many human diseases including but not limited to cancer, viral infections, cardiovascular diseases and inflammatory diseases [ 10].
5: Natural antioxidants may also be revered due to their safer side effect profile compared to synthetic antioxidants used in preventative medicine and in the food industry [ 10].
