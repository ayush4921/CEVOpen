In this same 2014 study by Audu, and colleagues, it is suggested that amino acids might be most concentrated within the leaves of the 
 <italic>Cannabis sativa</italic> plant [
 <xref rid="B67-plants-10-00400" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. This is understandable because trichomes (the cellâ€™s factory) are most concentrated in the leaves of plant. In one study aspartic acid, glutamic acid and arginine were the most prominent amino acids produced in hempseed [

 <italic>C. sativa</italic> L.) isolates produced significantly higher levels of essential amino acid to total produced amino acids (with the exception of lysine), in comparison to a soy protein isolate [
