0: Studies of the antioxidant activity of different  S. montana extracts (volatile and nonvolatile fractions) obtained by supercritical extraction and by hydrodistillation and soxhlet extraction allowed to compare the most known methods of obtaining volatile and essential oils, and DPPH and Rancimat methods.
1: The volatile oil obtained by supercritical extraction was more active in scavenging the DPPH radical or inhibiting the lipid oxidation as it contained thymoquinone in 15 times higher than the essential oil obtained by hydrodistillation.
2: Thymoquinone has antioxidant, neuroprotective, and anti-cancer activities [ 11].
