0: Phytochemical analysis of aerial parts of  S. montana showed the presence of phenolic compounds, including flavonoids, and hydroxycinnamic acids, and compounds of essential oil (monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, diterpens, etc.)
1: [ 1, 6, 12].
2: Plant phenolics are a highly diversified group of compounds, which comprises simple phenolics, phenolic acids (hydroxycinnamic and hydroxybenzoic acids derivates), lignans, lignins, coumarins, flavonoids, stilbens, flavolignans, and tannins, phenolic terpenes, etc.

4: Phenolics are very important plant antioxidants which inhibit undesirable oxidative processes in food products and the human body [ 12, 14, 15, 16].
5: For that reason, the identification and quantification of phenolic compounds could be regarded as a tool related to potential of food and health benefits and accordingly as a quality index of elaborated tinctures [ 12, 15].
