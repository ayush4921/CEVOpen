<p>According to the conception of analytical quality by design, time is considered as one of the critical method parameters in the analytical procedure of the determination of total phenolics by means of the spectrophotometric method with Folinâ€“Ciocalteu reagent (FCR) as the reaction time has an impact on the performance of this method [

 <xref rid="B25-molecules-25-04763" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Moreover, changes in time can be regarded also as a deliberate variation in the method parameters. Such a variation is also related to the robustness of the analytical procedure and should be evaluated in the development of this analytical procedure [
