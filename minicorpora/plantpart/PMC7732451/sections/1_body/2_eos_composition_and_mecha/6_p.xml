<p>It seems that the sensitivity of Gram-positive bacteria is related to the direct interaction of the hydrophobic components of the EOs with the cell wall (
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>–
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>). The cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria is made of a thick layer of peptidoglycans (90–95%), teichoic acid, and proteins (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>). Due to the hydrophobic nature of major parts of EOs, they can easily pass through it. On the other hand, Gram-negative bacteria have a more complex structure including a monolayer of peptidoglycans surrounded by an outer layer comprising proteins and lipopolysaccharides (LPS). This outer cell membrane is charged and possesses a hydrophilic nature, and therefore, diffusion of hydrophobic compound is limited through LPS (

 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>). Therefore, due to structure variation in the outer layers of bacteria, Gram-positive bacteria such as

 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> can be more easily inhibited by EOs than Gram-negative bacteria such as

 <italic>Salmonella enteritidis</italic> (
