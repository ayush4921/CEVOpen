<p>EOs are made of different compounds characterized by colorless to slightly yellowish liquid and poorly soluble or insoluble in water, but soluble in organic solvents (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). EOs mostly possess a pleasant odor and sometimes a specific taste, and they are utilized in considerable amount in the flavoring and perfume industries. Various fragrance extraction methods including cold pressing and extraction and distillation such as steam distillation are used in order to prepare and obtain EOs (
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>–
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). In total, almost 3,000 EOs are known, among which 300 are commercially utilized in pharmaceutical, food, agronomic, sanitary, cosmetic, and perfume industries (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). The species of plant, plant geographic origin, climate, composition of soil, the vegetative stage of the plant, and the part of plant that is utilized for extraction of EO are the factors that affect the composition of EOs (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>–
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). EOs are usually secreted as secondary metabolites which exhibit antibacterial, antifungal, and antibiofilm properties (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). These various biological activities are directly related to the bioactive volatile components that are present in EOs (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Almost 90–95% of EOs are volatile components such as aliphatic aldehydes, alcohols, esters, monoterpenes, and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons and their oxygenated derivatives. The nonvolatile part, which makes up 5–10% of EOs, comprises hydrocarbons, fatty acids, sterols, carotenoids, waxes, coumarins, and flavonoids (
