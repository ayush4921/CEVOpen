<p>As aforementioned, EOs have antimicrobial activities against a wide range of microorganisms; however, the exact antimicrobial mechanism has not been completely elucidated, and it cannot be attributed to an individual mechanism. It seems that based on the chemical compounds contained in the EOs, several mechanisms are involved in the antimicrobial properties of EOs (

 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). It has been mentioned that the antimicrobial activity of EOs may be due to the possible penetration of EOs through the bacterial cell wall and exertion of inhibitory effects on the functional properties of the cell (

 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). The hydrophobicity of EOs lets them break down the lipid layer of the bacterial cell membrane and mitochondrion, making the structure more penetrable, and therefore, leakage of ions and other cell compounds occurs, and when the leakages are more than the limit, cell death occurs (

 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). It has been indicated that disruption of the cell membrane by phenolic compounds of EOs causes exudation of the internal contents of the cell and inhibits functional properties of the cell (

It has been proposed that phenolic compounds of EOs exert antimicrobial properties by changing the permeability of the microbial cell, damaging cytoplasmic membranes, intervening in the generation system of cellular energy (ATP), and disrupting the proton motive force (
