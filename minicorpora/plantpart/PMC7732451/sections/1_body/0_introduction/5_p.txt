6: Various studies have reported that EOs from aromatic and medicinal plants have antimicrobial properties against  L. monocytogenes ( 4,  20,  26 31).
7: Due to the described antimicrobial activity of EOs against various microorganisms, this study aimed to review the effect of various EOs on  L. monocytogenes when applied to meat and poultry products.
