<p>Also, various preservatives have been utilized to hinder contamination during production, distribution, and storage as well as to increase shelf life of raw and processed meat and poultry products. Although food-grade and Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) synthetic additives have been usually used in the food industry, in recent years, consumers have shown an increasing concern about the use of synthetic chemical preservatives (

 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Therefore, there is an increasing tendency in using natural additives including antioxidants, antimicrobials, sweeteners, and coloring agents that originated from animals, plants, and microorganisms (

 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Various naturally occurring antimicrobial agents have been recognized. Lactoperoxidase, lactoferrin, lysozyme from animal sources, bacteriocins and natamycin from microbial sources, and essential oils (EOs) from plant sources are examples of natural preservatives (
