<p>This study has revealed that EOs could be potentially used as a replacement for chemical preservatives in meat and poultry products to mitigate or inhibit growth of 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>. The antimicrobial properties of EOs are ascribed to the action of various compounds that are present in the EOs. Thymol, carvacrol, eugenol, carvone, cinnamaldehyde, limonene, α- and β-pinene, and 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene can be named as examples of major compounds of EOs that exert anti-
 <italic>Listeria</italic> activity through different mechanisms such as changing fatty acid profiles and the structure of cell membrane and increasing cell permeability as well as affecting membrane proteins and inhibition of functional properties of the cell wall. However, due to the possible negative effect of EOs, especially in high concentrations, on the organoleptic properties of meat and poultry products, the concentration of these substances utilized in meat and poultry products should be carefully taken into consideration. Furthermore, a combination of low amounts of EOs with other natural antimicrobial substances and technologies which exert synergistic antimicrobial effects could be applied to efficiently prevent growth of 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> in meat and poultry products. Incorporation of EOs to edible films and coatings, microencapsulation or nanoencapsulation of EOs, use EO mixtures, and application of EOs with new packaging methods and emerging technology such as high hydrostatic pressure, irradiation, high-intensity pulsed electric field, and cold plasma can be more efficient in inhibiting 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> growth and enhancing the safety and quality of meat and poultry products, which should be studied in future investigations.
