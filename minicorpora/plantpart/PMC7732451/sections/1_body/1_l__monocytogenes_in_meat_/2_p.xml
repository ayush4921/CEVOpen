 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> is a pathogenic, Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, facultative anaerobic, highly mobile, rod-shaped bacterium (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> is a major causative agent of foodborne illness worldwide. The severe invasive disease caused by 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> is listeriosis (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). It has been indicated that listeriosis carries high rates of hospitalization and mortality. Nearly 94% of confirmed cases of listeriosis need to be hospitalized, and 14% of them die (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Based on the somatic O antigen, 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> can be subclassified into 13 serotypes. All the 13 serotypes can cause listeriosis; however, serotypes 1.2b, 1.2a, and 4b are more widespread (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Apart from food matrix diversity, capacity for pathogenicity, and geographical area, the most isolated serotypes from food products are 4c, 4b, 3b, 1.2a, and 1.2b (

 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>).
