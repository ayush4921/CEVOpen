<p>In addition, Noori et al. studied the antimicrobial properties of nanoemulsion-based edible sodium caseinate coating containing ginger EO (3 and 6% wt.) on chicken breast filets. They found that nanoemulsion-based edible coating containing 6% of ginger EO nanoemulsion significantly decreased total aerobic psychrophilic bacteria during 12 days of storage. It seems that nanoemulsion formation results in a reduction in EO droplet size and therefore there is faster penetration of the antimicrobial compounds into the bacterial cell. Hence, this increased antimicrobial activity of nanoemulsions, in comparison with conventional emulsions, allows the application of lower concentrations of EOs in food and active coating or packaging (

 <italic>Z. multiflora</italic> EO increased reduction of 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> in turkey meat in comparison to control during 18 days of storage at 4°C (

 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> in ground chicken breast was studied by Irkin et al. They found that VP and MAP efficiency against 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> can be enhanced by the addition of bay EO in chicken meat (

 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> in a shorter time and with the lowest final levels in ham slices in comparison to the ones where high-pressure processing and edible films with oregano EO were separately utilized (
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>). Additionally, it has been reported by Criado et al. that there was a synergistic effect among thyme EO and irradiation on the reduction of the 
 <italic>Listeria innocua</italic> population and extension of the shelf life of ground meat (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Similarly, the combined effect of gamma (γ)-irradiation and microencapsulated oregano and cinnamon EO and nisin against 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> on RTE ham was investigated by Huq et al. They found that γ-irradiation treatment and microencapsulated antimicrobials showed a synergistic antimicrobial effect on RTE meat products during storage (
