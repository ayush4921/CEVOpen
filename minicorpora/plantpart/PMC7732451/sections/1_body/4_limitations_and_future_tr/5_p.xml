<p>In order to rectify this shortcoming, various approaches have been suggested. Incorporation of EOs to edible films and coatings, microencapsulation or nanoencapsulation of EOs, use of EO mixtures, and concomitant use of EOs with other preservation methods such as low temperature, new packaging methods, thermal and nonthermal processes can be named as examples of these strategies (

Therefore, there is a limitation of using spices with a strong flavor like clove. They suggested that a combination of other preservatives such as acid or salt with clove EO and proper storage condition can be useful in reducing the unfavorable sensory effect of clove EO (
