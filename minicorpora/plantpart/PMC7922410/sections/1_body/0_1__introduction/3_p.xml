<p>Chemical and biological nematicides are commonly used against plant-parasitic nematodes with variable efficacy. Although most chemical nematicides show high nematicidal efficacy under field conditions, their impact on human health and on the environment has resulted in enforced regulation or the total ban of the different products [
