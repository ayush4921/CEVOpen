<p>NEMguard
 <sup>速</sup> DE (Certis) is a granular nematicide, produced from allicin extracted from crushed garlic, with polysulfides 3, 4 and 5 as the main active substances [
 <xref rid="B14-plants-10-00394" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Diatomaceous earth (DE) is used as a carrier of the polysulfides on NEMguard
 <sup>速</sup> DE in order to improve soil application and it contains 450 g/kg garlic extract. For its optimal application and in order to allow the release of the polysulfides, 20 mm of irrigation is recommended right after product application in the soil, before planting. For active control, it requires the emulsified state of NEMguard
 <sup>速</sup> DE to reach the nematodes in the soil [
 <xref rid="B14-plants-10-00394" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Its activity against 
 <italic>Meloidogyne</italic> spp. on horticultural crops, such as tomato, carrot, lettuce and melon is reported [
 <xref rid="B21-plants-10-00394" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], showing comparable efficacy to synthetic nematicides, in vitro, against the plant-parasitic nematode 
 <italic>Longidorus elongatus</italic> [

 <xref rid="B23-plants-10-00394" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, other studies have reported only limited nematicidal effects for NEMguard
 <sup>速</sup> DE [
