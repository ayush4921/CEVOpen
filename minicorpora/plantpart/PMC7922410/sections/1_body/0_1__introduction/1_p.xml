<p>Plant-parasitic root-knot nematodes (RKN) of the genus 
 <italic>Meloidogyne</italic> are severe plant pathogens that cause significant economic losses by inducing the development of root knot galls, altering the plant vascular system and draining essential nutrients from the host [
 <xref rid="B1-plants-10-00394" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The severe plant damage caused by these obligate biotrophic nematodes can result in wilting, stunted growth, leaf discoloration, root deformation, reduced yield and crop quality (up to the total crop loss). RKN infection can also contribute to reduced plant resistance to other biotic and abiotic stresses and therefore nematode attack is often related to other problems such as drought, nutrient deficiency and different pathogens causing similar diseases, all resulting in economic losses for the growers [
