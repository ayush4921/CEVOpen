<p>The modes of action and the potential cellular targets of diallyl polysulfides are attributed to the different reactive sulfur species [
 <xref rid="B8-plants-10-00394" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, its function is not fully researched in detail. One of its mode of actions is attributed to the metal binding capacity of diallyl polysulfides that can disturb metal homeostasis [
 <xref rid="B8-plants-10-00394" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In addition, low molecular weight thiols can cause a shift in the redox balance, form different disulfides and alter enzyme activity [
 <xref rid="B8-plants-10-00394" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Therefore, the formation of reactive oxygen species might cause DNA damage and/or cell apoptosis [
 <xref rid="B13-plants-10-00394" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, the primary mode of action of diallyl polysulfides is still uncertain [
 <xref rid="B8-plants-10-00394" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and as for many nematicides, there might be a multi-site inhibitory effect as described for NEMguard

 <xref rid="B15-plants-10-00394" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], garlic oil, garlic extract, garlic straw and garlic-derived polysulfides have shown to control those pests and pathogens with success [
