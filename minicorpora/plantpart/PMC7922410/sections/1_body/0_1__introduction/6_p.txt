0: NEMguard  DE (Certis) is a granular nematicide, produced from allicin extracted from crushed garlic, with polysulfides 3, 4 and 5 as the main active substances [ 14].
1: Diatomaceous earth (DE) is used as a carrier of the polysulfides on NEMguard  DE in order to improve soil application and it contains 450 g/kg garlic extract.
2: For its optimal application and in order to allow the release of the polysulfides, 20 mm of irrigation is recommended right after product application in the soil, before planting.
3: For active control, it requires the emulsified state of NEMguard  DE to reach the nematodes in the soil [ 14].
4: Its activity against  Meloidogyne spp.
5: on horticultural crops, such as tomato, carrot, lettuce and melon is reported [ 21], showing comparable efficacy to synthetic nematicides, in vitro, against the plant-parasitic nematode  Longidorus elongatus [ 22, 23].
6: However, other studies have reported only limited nematicidal effects for NEMguard  DE [ 24].
