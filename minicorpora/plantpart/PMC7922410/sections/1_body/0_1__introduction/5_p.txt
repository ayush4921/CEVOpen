0: The modes of action and the potential cellular targets of diallyl polysulfides are attributed to the different reactive sulfur species [ 8].
1: However, its function is not fully researched in detail.
2: One of its mode of actions is attributed to the metal binding capacity of diallyl polysulfides that can disturb metal homeostasis [ 8].
3: In addition, low molecular weight thiols can cause a shift in the redox balance, form different disulfides and alter enzyme activity [ 8].
4: Therefore, the formation of reactive oxygen species might cause DNA damage and/or cell apoptosis [ 13].
5: However, the primary mode of action of diallyl polysulfides is still uncertain [ 8] and as for many nematicides, there might be a multi-site inhibitory effect as described for NEMguard  DE containing 45% of garlic extract [ 14, 15].
6: Despite the uncertain mode of action on plant-parasitic nematodes and other plant pathogens [ 15], garlic oil, garlic extract, garlic straw and garlic-derived polysulfides have shown to control those pests and pathogens with success [ 16].
7: For decades, nematicidal activity of different garlic compositions have been reported against  Meloidogyne spp.
8: [ 17, 18, 19, 20] and different garlic-based pesticides are approved/registered and sold to control nematodes and other pests with different levels of success [ 16].
