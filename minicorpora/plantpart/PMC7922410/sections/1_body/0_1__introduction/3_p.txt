0: Chemical and biological nematicides are commonly used against plant-parasitic nematodes with variable efficacy.
1: Although most chemical nematicides show high nematicidal efficacy under field conditions, their impact on human health and on the environment has resulted in enforced regulation or the total ban of the different products [ 3].
2: To control plant-parasitic nematodes, grafting, biofumigation, heat treatment, soil compost and crop rotation with poor hosts, catch crops or antagonistic microorganisms have been intensively studied [ 4, 5, 6].
3: However, further management methods, such as plant-based metabolites are being investigated to search for alternative human and environment friendly biopesticides [ 3, 7].
