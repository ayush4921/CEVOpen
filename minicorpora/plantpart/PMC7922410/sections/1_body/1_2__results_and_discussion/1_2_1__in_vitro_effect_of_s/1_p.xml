<p>The in vitro investigation of NEMguard
 <sup>®</sup> DE solubilized in tap water revealed increasing nematicidal activity with increasing concentration and prolonged exposure (
 <xref rid="plants-10-00394-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Overall, 0.5 mg/mL or higher concentrations of NEMguard
 <sup>®</sup> DE showed significant effect on J2 (immotile) compared to the water control. Only the lowest concentration tested, 0.25 mg/mL did not have a significant impact on the J2, where there was no significantly difference among the number of immotile J2 on the treatment and on the water control. By evaluating the dead J2 with the NaOH method, the number of immotile J2 only significantly differed from the dead ones (NaOH) twice, revealing that the visual observation was in line with the evaluation of the dead J2 (

 <xref rid="B20-plants-10-00394" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] tested the effect of garlic oil on 
 <italic>M. incognita</italic> J2, using the same method to test immotile J2 from dead J2. However, the NaOH method differed from the immotile J2 in the lower concentrations of the oil they tested, showing that there can be differences in the visual assumption, nematode behavior or fitness and therefore the use of NaOH is a good tool for this distinction.
