<p>The decline of normal moving J2 with the increasing concentration of NEMguard
 <sup>®</sup> DE was also reflected in the gall index (GI) of cucumber roots, essential for evaluating the J2 infectious capacity after being exposed to the nematicide product (
 <xref rid="plants-10-00394-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The GI was significantly reduced at 0.5 mg/mL compared to the water control. However, the strongest reduction of root galling was observed using concentrations between 0.25 mg/mL and 0.5 mg/mL of NEMguard
 <sup>®</sup> DE. On these treatments the GI reduced from 6.5, 6.2 and 5.8 to 4.3, 2.6 and 2.4 after 24 h, 48 h and 96 h, of incubation time, respectively. Overall, the highest concentration presented, 2 mg/mL, showed the strongest controlling effect on J2, resulting in no root galls after the J2 were incubated for 48 h and 96 h to NEMguard
 <sup>®</sup> DE. These findings are in line with previous investigations, showing that the nematicidal potential of the NEMguard
 <sup>®</sup> solution (NEMguard
 <sup>®</sup> SC), a different formulation as the one we used for our study against 
 <italic>M. incognita</italic>, is concentration and time dependent [
