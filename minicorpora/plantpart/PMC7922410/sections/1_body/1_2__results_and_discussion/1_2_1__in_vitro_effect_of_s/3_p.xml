<p>Comparing the immotile J2 among the treatments with 1 and 2 mg/mL, only small changes were recorded, the reduced effect on the J2 can be assumed due to a saturation in water of the NEMguard
 <sup>®</sup> DE product. For the calculation of the lethal concentrations (LC), LC
 <sub>50</sub> (50%) and LC
 <sub>90</sub> (90%), the NaOH data was used (
 <xref rid="plants-10-00394-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The LC
 <sub>50</sub> and LC
 <sub>90</sub> results supported the assumption that the concentration in water was close before saturation, reaching an LC
 <sub>90</sub> of 1.5 mg/mL after 96 h with a 95% fiducial limit ranging between 1.1 to 1.9 mg/mL (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00394-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Therefore, based on the LC calculations and the gall index (
 <xref rid="plants-10-00394-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00394-f001">Figure 1</xref>), 2 mg/mL is sufficient to control over 95% of 
 <italic>M. incognita</italic> J2 in vitro within 96 h. Further investigation (data not shown) using 4 mg/mL NEMguard
 <sup>®</sup> DE did not show significant differences compared to 2 mg/mL. As we never reached 100% immotile/dead J2 within 96h, we assume that the progressive insolubility of polysulfides with higher chain length in water [
 <xref rid="B27-plants-10-00394" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], reached its saturation point around 2 mg of NEMguard
 <sup>®</sup> DE/mL and therefore 4 mg/mL did not differ in the nematicidal effect compared to the 2 mg/mL.
