<p>Although, we have not investigated the combination of different polysulfides, it is worthwhile mentioning, that previous studies showed that the lethal concentration of garlic oil or the combination of diallyl disulfide and diallyl trisulfide reached the LC
 <sub>50</sub> at lower concentrations than diallyl disulfide or diallyl trisulfide alone [

 <sup>Â®</sup> DE mainly consists of polysulfides 3, 4 and 5 and therefore might have a stronger nematicidal effect as the single polysulfide alone.
