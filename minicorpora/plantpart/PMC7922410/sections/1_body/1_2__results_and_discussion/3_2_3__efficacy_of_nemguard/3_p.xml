<p>One factor contributing to the lack of control of 
 <italic>M. incognita</italic> in the large greenhouse trial could be the composition of the soil. The soil used in the pot experiments was characterized as sandy loam, which is described to have the lowest restriction for diallyl disulfide movement compared to fine sand or silty clay loam [
 <xref rid="B31-plants-10-00394" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, the soil used had a silt contend of 29.2%, which might have caused an effect on NEMguard
 <sup>速</sup> DE, as silt is described to inhibit the polysulfide activity [
 <xref rid="B31-plants-10-00394" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Therefore, the suppliers do not recommend NEMguard
 <sup>速</sup> DE in silty soils (Best practice application guide [
 <xref rid="B14-plants-10-00394" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]). Presumably, the lack of 
 <italic>M. incognita</italic> control might be based on the content of silt present in the soil used on our experiment and the possibility, that the well-rooted pots gave the hatched J2 the possibility to find a host root with no or little exposure to the reapplied NEMguard
 <sup>速</sup> DE. In this way, additional investigations are needed to reveal to which extend soil texture can affect the efficacy of NEMguard
 <sup>速</sup> DE, since nematicidal activity was observed at the in vitro assay and at the small pot experiment, where one part of soil was supplemented with 2 parts of silver sand.
