<p>As in the small pot experiment, no phytotoxic effects were visible on the plants within the different treatments. The tomato yield in 2019 and 2020 differed at the end of the growth season, however only the control plants (free of nematodes), with the highest tomato yield were significantly different to the other plants (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-10-00394">Table S2</xref>). Comparing the tomato yield over time, the different treatments and controls showed that the nematode free control differed from the infected plants, between mid to end of the growth seasons, resulting in a higher accumulated yield in both years (

 <italic>M. incognita</italic> on the final yield and the impact they can cause on the growers economic success. 
 <italic>M. incognita</italic> requires 400 °C-days/life cycle [
 <xref rid="B30-plants-10-00394" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Thus, based on the accumulated temperature at the greenhouse, in 2019 and 2020 trials 4.8 live cycles (1921 °C-days) and 5.0 life cycles (2011 °C-days) were completed. In this way, the increasing yield loss can be attributed to the increase of 
 <italic>M. incognita</italic> population over time.
