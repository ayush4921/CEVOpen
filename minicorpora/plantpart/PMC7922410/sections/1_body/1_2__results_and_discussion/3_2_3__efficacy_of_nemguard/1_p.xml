<p>NEMguard
 <sup>®</sup> DE was evaluated in a large-scale tomato trial against 
 <italic>M. incognita,</italic> using the same experimental set up as that of the small pots, over the entire growth seasons in 2019 and 2020 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00394-f002">Figure 2</xref>). No significant effect between the two NEMguard
 <sup>®</sup> DE treatments and the nematode control was observed on early, mid and late root gall index in both years (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00394-f002">Figure 2</xref>A,C). However, despite no significant differences, the repeated NEMguard
 <sup>®</sup> DE application had a reduced J2 population at the end of both growth seasons (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00394-f002">Figure 2</xref>B,D), indicating that there is an effect on the J2 in the soil. However, as the nematicidal effect of NEMguard
 <sup>®</sup> DE increases over time and as the plant roots in the pots had a limited area for growth, freshly hatched J2 might have an advantage in the well-rooted environment to escape from the nematicidal polysulfides applied monthly. Therefore, the reducing effect on the 
 <italic>M. incognita</italic> soil population was not sufficient to reduce root galling. Similar results were reported with reduced J2 population in soil treated with NEMguard
 <sup>®</sup> DE and a slight reduced galling on tomato roots during a greenhouse trail in north Germany [
 <xref rid="B24-plants-10-00394" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. On the other hand, Ladurner et al. [
 <xref rid="B21-plants-10-00394" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] reported sufficient control by NEMguard
 <sup>®</sup> granules on tomato, carrot, lettuce and melon, and Peçen et al. [
 <xref rid="B29-plants-10-00394" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] reported a root gall reduction of 9.62% compared to the control.
