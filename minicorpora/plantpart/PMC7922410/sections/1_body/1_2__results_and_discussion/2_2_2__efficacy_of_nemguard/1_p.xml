 <xref rid="B14-plants-10-00394" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], the controlling effect of NEMguard
 <sup>®</sup> DE against 
 <italic>M. incognita</italic> was further tested in small pots using silver sand:soil mixture. Our results revealed that the single application of NEMguard
 <sup>®</sup> DE, as recommended by the supplier [

 <italic>M. incognita</italic> inoculation (

 <sup>®</sup> DE was applied a second time as we tested the effect of NEMguard
 <sup>®</sup> DE during the period of an additional nematode life cycle. The reapplication of NEMguard
 <sup>®</sup> DE was evaluated as an additional investigation and it is not described by the supplier [
 <xref rid="B14-plants-10-00394" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Furthermore, the treatments, NEMguard 1 and NEMGuard 2 showed reduced numbers of emigrated J2 from the 59 days old root systems compared to the control roots (
