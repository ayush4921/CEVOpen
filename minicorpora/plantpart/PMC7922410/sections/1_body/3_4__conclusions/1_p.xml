<p>As a botanical nematicide, NEMguard
 <sup>®</sup> DE appears to have advantages as biological available product and potentially supporting organic farmers on the control of plant parasitic nematodes. However, according to our investigations, the nematicidal activity observed in vitro, did not remain in the large greenhouse experiment and insufficiently controlled 
 <italic>Meloidogyne incognita</italic>. Nevertheless, nematicidal effects were observed in our small pot experiment where the soil was supplemented with silver sand. We conclude that, further testing of the nematicidal potential of NEMguard
 <sup>®</sup> DE under different soil compositions is essential, in order to allow drawing conclusions if the soil composition has an impact on the nematicidal properties of NEMguard
 <sup>®</sup> DE. In addition, different NEMguard
 <sup>®</sup> formulations, such as NEMguard
 <sup>®</sup> SC might enhance the nematicidal effect of the garlic-based products under different soil compositions and should be further investigated.
