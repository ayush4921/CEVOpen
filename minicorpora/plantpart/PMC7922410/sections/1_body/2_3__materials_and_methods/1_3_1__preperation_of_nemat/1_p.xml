 <italic>Meloidogyne incognita</italic> (Mi-virulent population described by Hallmann and Kiewnick [
 <xref rid="B2-plants-10-00394" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]) were cultured under greenhouse conditions on 
 <italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic> cv. Oskar (60% humidity, 25 °C/19 °C, 15 h/9 h day-night cycle). Heavily galled root systems were placed under the mist chamber at 23 °C to extract second stage juveniles (J2) [
 <xref rid="B4-plants-10-00394" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. 
 <italic>M. incognita</italic> eggs were extracted from 1 cm cut roots submerged in 1% NaClO water solution and shaken for 3 min in a 0.5 L plastic bottle. A 20 μm mesh sieve was used to collect eggs and to rinse thoroughly with water to remove excessive NaClO. Collected eggs were rinsed on an Oostenbrink dish and left at room temperature for hatching. 
 <italic>M. incognita</italic> eggs and/or J2 were stored at 6 °C for a maximum of 5 days before use.
