<p>The NEMguard
 <sup>®</sup> DE inhibitory effect on 
 <italic>M. incognita</italic> J2 was tested in vitro in an aqueous assay. NEMguard
 <sup>®</sup> DE was prepared as a double strength suspension by re-suspending granules in tap water overnight. For each treatment and time point, 1550 J2 were exposed to final concentrations of 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2 or 4 mg/mL of NEMguard
 <sup>®</sup> DE. After 24 h, 48 h and 96 h, we examined three times 100 J2 for each treatment, using a light microscope (40x magnification) to monitor the mortality (normal motility, affected motility and immotile (elongated)) (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3). To determine live immotile (elongated) J2, the NaOH method described by Chen and Dickson [
 <xref rid="B33-plants-10-00394" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] was applied and the triplicate (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3) of the same 100 J2 was monitored according to their mortality. For each treatment and time point, five times 250 J2 were washed with tap water free from NEMguard
 <sup>®</sup> DE, using a 20 μm mesh sieve. Each of the washed 250 J2 were applied to a pre-germinated cucumber seedling to evaluate their infection capacity in a bio test. Cucumber seedlings were grown in 30 mL pots (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5) filled with a soil:silver sand mix (1:3, 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) and were placed in a growth chamber set to 23 °C ± 2 °C, 16:8 day:night photoperiod and 60% relative humidity. Four weeks after inoculation, cucumber roots were washed free of soil and 
 <italic>M. incognita</italic> root gall formation was determined on a scale from 0-10 according to Zeck [
