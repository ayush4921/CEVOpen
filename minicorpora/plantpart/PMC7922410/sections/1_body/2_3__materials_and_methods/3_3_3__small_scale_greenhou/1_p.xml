<p>Small greenhouse experiments were conducted in pots (∅ = 13 cm) filled with soil:silver sand mix (1:2

 <italic>v</italic>), inoculated with approximately 2000 J2/pot, covered to keep soil moist and let stand for 3 days. The experiment was split into a negative control, a positive control with nematodes, a single NEMguard
 <sup>®</sup> DE treatment (NEMguard 1) and a double, NEMguard
 <sup>®</sup> DE + NEMguard
 <sup>®</sup> DE treatment (NEMguard 2), with the second treatment being applied during plant growth. Each treatment was replicated six times (
 <italic>n</italic> = 6). “Root balls” of 5-week-old tomato plants cv. Oskar were embedded in 1 gram NEMguad
 <sup>®</sup> DE/plant, by well distributing the granules around the “root ball” and planting into the pots. The second NEMguard
 <sup>®</sup> DE application was carried out 24 days after planting, by preparing a 1 g NEMguard
 <sup>®</sup> DE tap water suspension as a 25 mL solution, directly applied at the soil surface of each plant. Plants were grown for 31 days and 59 days at 22 °C ± 2 °C, with a 16:8 day:night photoperiod and watered according to the plant needs. For each pot and time point, the gall index was determined after Zeck [
 <xref rid="B25-plants-10-00394" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], on a scale from 0–10 (with 0 being a healthy uninfected plant root system and 10 a root-knot nematode destroyed plant root system). Plant height, fresh and dry weights, root fresh and dry weights and root dry matter, were determined 31 days after treatment. Root weight and J2 hatched from root systems placed under the mist chamber were taken at 59 days after treatment.
