<p>The large-scale greenhouse tomato trial took place at Agroscope in Wädenswil, using 64 x 15 L pots. The experiment was designed as four rows with treatments of NEMguard
 <sup>®</sup> DE (NEMguard 1), NEMguard
 <sup>®</sup> DE + NEMguard
 <sup>®</sup> DE (NEMguard 2), positive and negative nematode controls randomly arranged as pairs of two. Pots were filled to ⅔ with steamed field soil characterized as sandy loam (containing humus 3.2% 
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic>; clay 16.7% 
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic>; silt 29.2% 
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic>) and inoculated with a suspension containing approximately 4600 and 4500 
 <italic>M. incognita</italic> eggs (76%/55%) and J2 (24%/45%) per pot, in 2019 and 2020, respectively. NEMguard
 <sup>®</sup> DE was applied 3 days prior to planting, by mixing 1 g NEMguard
 <sup>®</sup> DE/1 L of soil into the last 5 L of soil/pot. Controls were treated accordingly without NEMguard
 <sup>®</sup> DE. All pots were watered immediately as recommended from the supplier [
 <xref rid="B14-plants-10-00394" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. For the NEMguard
 <sup>®</sup> DE + NEMguard
 <sup>®</sup> DE treatment, every 4 weeks NEMguard
 <sup>®</sup> DE was solubilized in tap water and applied as 5 g in 50 mL/plant and rinsed with 50 mL of tap water.
