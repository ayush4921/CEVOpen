<p>The grafted tomato Roterno F1 RZ and the Mi-resistant rootstock Maxiford (72-230; Rijk Zwaan) were used in both trials. Plants were watered and fertilized with water-soluble NPK fertilizer (Kristalon Red Acid, Yara, UK) according to the plant growth stage. In 2019 and 2020, root galling was indexed at week 10 (early (
 <italic>n</italic> = 4)), 15 (mid (
 <italic>n</italic> = 4)) and 23 (end (
 <italic>n</italic> = 8)). For each root rating, 
 <italic>M. incognita</italic> soil population was determined in 100 ml soil, using the Oostenbrink dish method [
