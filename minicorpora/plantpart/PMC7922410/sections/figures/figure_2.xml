  <p>Tomato root gall formation (

   <bold>C</bold>) and 
   <italic>Meloidogyne incognita</italic> juvenile second stage (J2) soil population (
   <bold>B</bold>,
   <bold>D</bold>) development in the large-scale greenhouse trial over 10 (early), 15 (mid) and 23 (end) weeks testing NEMguard
   <sup>®</sup> DE applied before planting (NEMguard 1) and applied before planting followed by a monthly application (NEMguard 2). Suspensions containing approximately 4600 (2019) or 4500 (2020) 
   <italic>M. incognita</italic> eggs/J2 were inoculated per pot. Values for the gall index (GI) according to Zeck [
   <xref rid="B25-plants-10-00394" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and J2 populations are means of 
   <italic>n</italic> = 4 (early and mid) and 
   <italic>n</italic> = 8 (end), respectively. No significant difference according to one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey HSD test among the treatments and the positive control (
   <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05). Positive (p) control = control with 
   <italic>M. incognita</italic>, negative (n) control = soil free of 
   <italic>M. incognita.</italic>.
