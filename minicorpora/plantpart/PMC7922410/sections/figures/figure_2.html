 <caption> Tomato root gall formation ( A, C) and Meloidogyne incognita juvenile second stage (J2) soil population ( B, D) development in the large-scale greenhouse trial over 10 (early), 15 (mid) and 23 (end) weeks testing NEMguard ® DE applied before planting (NEMguard 1) and applied before planting followed by a monthly application (NEMguard 2). Suspensions containing approximately 4600 (2019) or 4500 (2020) M. incognita eggs/J2 were inoculated per pot. Values for the gall index (GI) according to Zeck [ 25] and J2 populations are means of n = 4 (early and mid) and n = 8 (end), respectively. No significant difference according to one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey HSD test among the treatments and the positive control ( p ≤ 0.05). Positive (p) control = control with M. incognita, negative (n) control = soil free of M. incognita.. </caption>
