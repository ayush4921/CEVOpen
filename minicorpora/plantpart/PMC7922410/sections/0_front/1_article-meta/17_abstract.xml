 <p>The devastating root-knot nematode 
  <italic>Meloidogyne incognita</italic> can cause severe damage to field and greenhouse crops. Due to high economic losses, alternative products are essential to replace banned or strictly regulated nematicides that affect human health and/or the environment. Garlic based products have been previously investigated as environmentally friendly nematicides and their active substances, diallyl polysulfides exist as formulated nematicides on the market. We tested the garlic-based nematicide NEMguard
  <sup>速</sup> DE as protective of tomato roots. In vitro evaluation of the lethal concentration (LC) showed strong nematicidal activity with LC
  <sub>50</sub> of 0.8 mg/mL after 96 h and LC
  <sub>90</sub> of 1.5 mg/mL. NEMguard
  <sup>速</sup> DE showed protective effect against 
  <italic>M. incognita</italic> as a single application in small pots and a second application further reduced root galling, significantly. Large greenhouse trials were carried out in two consecutive years to test single and monthly applications of NEMguard
  <sup>速</sup> DE. In both years, no controlling effect could be observed on 
  <italic>M.</italic>
  <italic>incognita</italic>. We assume that the silt content of the loamy sandy soil used had an effect on the polysulfides, inhibiting their nematicidal effect. We conclude that further experiments are necessary to investigate the nematicidal potential of NEMguard
  <sup>速</sup> DE under different soil compositions or as a different formulation.
