<p>This work identified some top species like 
 <italic>C. langsdforffii</italic>, 
 <italic>C. odorata</italic>, 
 <italic>H. lupulus</italic>, 
 <italic>P. nigrum</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aromaticum</italic>, which provide a high percentage of BCP along with interesting yields. These species, upon a skillful molecular fractionation to remove undesired/toxic monoterpenes, may provide high percentages of BCP that can be used for the preparation of new drugs or dietary supplements aimed to improve health, prevent lifestyle diseases and act as a valid support for chronical diseases such as pain, metabolic and neurological disorders.
