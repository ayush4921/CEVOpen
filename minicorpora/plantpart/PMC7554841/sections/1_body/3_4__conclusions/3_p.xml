<p>This survey also evidenced the common practice of many authors to ignore the importance of providing the yield of the distilled essential oil, which represent a basic starting point for all industrial applications of the plant species under study. This problem was often correlated with the low amount of plant material distilled. Although interesting from a chemical-analytical point of view, the sole chemical analysis of the essential oil is not useful if performed on a single plant or a few plants, because it does not provide any information on the population genetic variability, being mainly affected by phenotypic plasticity, which is responsible for individual variations inside a population [
