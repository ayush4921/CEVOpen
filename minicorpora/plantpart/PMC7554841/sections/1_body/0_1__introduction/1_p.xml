<p>The endogenous cannabinoid system (ECS) plays an important role in the immune response to an infection. At present, two cannabinoid (CB) receptors are described: cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB1) and cannabinoid type 2 receptor (CB2), both G-protein coupled receptors [
 <xref rid="B1-ijms-21-06540" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The CB2 receptor represents the peripheral CB, due to its expression on circulating immune cells. However, studies have also found CB2 expression in the brain, such as cerebellum and microglial cells [
 <xref rid="B2-ijms-21-06540" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The CB2 receptor is involved in the attenuation of inflammatory immune responses. CB2 receptor pathway activation entails the suppression of cytokine release from immune cells and thereby dampening of the inflammatory response (immunosuppression) [
