0: The endogenous cannabinoid system (ECS) plays an important role in the immune response to an infection.
1: At present, two cannabinoid (CB) receptors are described: cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB1) and cannabinoid type 2 receptor (CB2), both G-protein coupled receptors [ 1].
2: The CB2 receptor represents the peripheral CB, due to its expression on circulating immune cells.
3: However, studies have also found CB2 expression in the brain, such as cerebellum and microglial cells [ 2].
4: The CB2 receptor is involved in the attenuation of inflammatory immune responses.
5: CB2 receptor pathway activation entails the suppression of cytokine release from immune cells and thereby dampening of the inflammatory response (immunosuppression) [ 3].
