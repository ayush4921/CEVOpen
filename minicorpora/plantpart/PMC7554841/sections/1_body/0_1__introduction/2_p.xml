 <xref rid="B4-ijms-21-06540" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The Research Institute for Fragrance Materials (RIFM) evaluated BCP safety and the molecule has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration and by the European Food Safety Authority as a flavoring agent, which can be used in cosmetic and food additives [
 <xref rid="B5-ijms-21-06540" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Reports on oral sub-chronic toxicity support the safety of BCP for its proposed use also in medical food products [
 <xref rid="B5-ijms-21-06540" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. BCP has been reported to be active against several disorders, with particular reference to cancer, chronic pain and inflammation [
 <xref rid="B2-ijms-21-06540" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Non-clinical BCP toxicity and an absence of adverse effects have been described [
 <xref rid="B6-ijms-21-06540" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Moreover, BCP can act as a selective agonist of CB2 [
 <xref rid="B1-ijms-21-06540" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], it activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPAR α) [
 <xref rid="B7-ijms-21-06540" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and has been recently involved in the prevention of lipid accumulation and in the improvement of glucose uptake [
 <xref rid="B8-ijms-21-06540" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Therefore, BCP is a plant-derived bioactive molecule able to improve health and prevent lifestyle diseases. Moreover, the specificity of BCP for the CB2 receptor, mainly expressed in peripheral tissues, and its inability to bind CB1, which is predominantly expressed at the level of the central nervous system, implies that its action is devoid of the known psychoactive effects associated with the activation of CB1 [
