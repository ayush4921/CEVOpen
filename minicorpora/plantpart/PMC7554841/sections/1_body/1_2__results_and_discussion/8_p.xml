<p>The next analysis was at the familial level. A cluster analysis was calculated with average linkage method by using data of 
 <xref rid="ijms-21-06540-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> by considering as a category the plant families and the species number, yield% and BCP% as variables. The results of the cluster analysis show the presence of 6 clusters (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-06540-f003">Figure 3</xref>). The first cluster is made by the Asteraceae and the Lamiaceae which consist of a number of species &gt; 50 and a BCP% &lt; 31. The second cluster gathers all families whose species have a BCP% &gt; 35%; in this cluster, the Magnoliaceae and the Papilionaceae are separated in a subcluster because of their high BCP% and low yield%, whereas the Fabaceae (which include the above mentioned 
 <italic>C. langsdorffii</italic>) are separated in a subcluster because of their high yield %. The third cluster is made by families with a number of species &gt; 13 and a BCP% &gt; 23%; here, the Lauraceae, the Apiaceae and the Zingiberaceae are separated in a subcluster because of their higher BCP%. The genus 
 <italic>Ocotea</italic> is one of the largest of the Lauraceae family, with approximately 350 species distributed throughout tropical and subtropical America. 
 <italic>O. splendens</italic>, as many other 
 <italic>Ocotea</italic> species [
 <xref rid="B212-ijms-21-06540" ref-type="bibr">212</xref>] is characterized by a high percentage of BCP [
 <xref rid="B217-ijms-21-06540" ref-type="bibr">217</xref>]. In the Apiaceae family, the species 
 <italic>P. kotschyana</italic> spreads widely through Anatoly, Iran (northwest, west and center) and north of Iraq and contains BCP in all plant parts [
 <xref rid="B41-ijms-21-06540" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The family Zingiberaceae is well known for producing essential oils that are used to prevent and control several diseases; the species 
 <italic>R. breviscapa</italic> was found to possess a high percentage of BCP [
 <xref rid="B300-ijms-21-06540" ref-type="bibr">300</xref>]. The fourth cluster is made by families with a BCP% &gt; 26 and a subcluster separates the Atherospermaceae, the Flacourtiaceae and the Meliaceae because of their BCP%. The fifth cluster is made by families with a BCP% &lt; 25 and the Plantaginaceae are separated in a subcluster because of their relatively higher yield%. Finally, the sixth cluster is made by plant families with a low BCP percentage and a subcluster separates the Hernandiaceae, the Juglandaceae, the Phyllanthace and the Ptaeroxylaceae because of their BCP content lower than 11%.
