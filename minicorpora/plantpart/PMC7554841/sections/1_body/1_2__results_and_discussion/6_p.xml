<p>The plant part that contained the highest content of BCP was then analyzed. In order to evidence the statistical linkage between the plant parts, a cluster analysis was calculated by considering as category the plant part and as variables the number of species, the BCP% and the yield% reported in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-06540-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Euclidean distances were calculated by using the average linkage method. Five clusters were evidenced: the first cluster was made by plant parts reported in more than 100 species and was dominated by leaves and aerial parts, which contained in general a BCP percentage lower than 28%. The other four clusters were made by plant parts reported in less than 16 species. These four clusters were further subdivided according to their BCP content (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-06540-f002">Figure 2</xref>). As expected, the highest BCP percentage was found in oleo-gum resins (cluster 2), followed by roots, barks and branches (cluster 3). Flowers and buds (cluster 4) showed a high yield, whereas twigs and woods (cluster 5) had both low yields and BCP percentages (
