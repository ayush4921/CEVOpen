<p>In order to separate which species containing BCP were also represent in the Belfrit list, a scatter plot was obtained by selecting BCP% and yield% as variables (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-06540-f005">Figure 5</xref>). 
 <italic>C. langdorffii</italic>, 
 <italic>S. aromaticum</italic>, 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> and 
 <italic>B. virgilioides</italic> were characterized by a yield ranging from 2 to 28%, with varying percentages of BCP; on the other hand, high percentages of BCP but lower yields% were found for 
 <italic>A. eupatoria</italic>, 
 <italic>H. coronarium</italic>, 
 <italic>C. odorata</italic>, 
 <italic>P. americana</italic> and 
 <italic>M. keonigi</italic>. All other species showed both lower yields and BCP percentage.
