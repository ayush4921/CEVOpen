<p>In order to look for plant species with the highest BCP and yield percentages, a scatter plot was obtained, as depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-06540-f001">Figure 1</xref>. The highest yield and BCP percentages were found for 
 <italic>Copaifera langsdorffii</italic>. High BCP percentages but with decreasing yields were found for 
 <italic>Bursera microphylla</italic>, 
 <italic>Scutellaria havanensis</italic> and 
 <italic>Pentadesma butyracea</italic>. 
 <italic>Copaifera</italic> species, popularly known as copaiba oil, are widely used in Brazilian popular medicine and the genus is known for its high essential oil yield and BCP content [

 <italic>Scutellaria</italic> genus (Lamiaceae) consists of plants which are widely distributed throughout the world; 
 <italic>S. butyracea</italic> is an endemic plant native from Havana and is ethnomedically used for several purposes because of its BCP content [
