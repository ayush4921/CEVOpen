<p>The next analysis aimed to evidence the geographical areas from which the plant species listed in 
 <xref rid="ijms-21-06540-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> were collected. A cluster analysis was calculated with average linkage method, considering the country of origin as a category of their species number, yield% and BCP% as variables. The results of the cluster analysis show the presence of 6 clusters (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-06540-f004">Figure 4</xref>). The first cluster gathers countries with the highest number of species and a BCP percentage higher than 28%; here, a subcluster separates Brazil from India and Iran because of the higher number of species, in agreement with the literature data [
 <xref rid="B310-ijms-21-06540" ref-type="bibr">310</xref>]. The second and third clusters identify countries where BCP has the highest percentages, whereas the fourth cluster gathers countries with a number of species higher than 8. The fifth cluster is made by countries where the BCP content is the lowest, whereas the sixth cluster is made by two subclusters with BCP percentages ranging from 18 to 25%. One of these subclusters is made by countries (Colombia, Fiji, Kenya, Morocco, Niger, North Korea, Portugal and Togo) where the species had a BCP percentage higher than 24% (
