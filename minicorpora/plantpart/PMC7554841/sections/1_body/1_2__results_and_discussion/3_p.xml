<p>The essential oil yield of 243 species ranged from 0.001 to 8.58%, whereas the BCP percentage of all selected species ranged from 9.8 (the threshold minimum level for species selection) to 75.6% (
 <xref rid="ijms-21-06540-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), providing an average percentage of 0.42% for yield and 27.4% for BCP. As shown in 
 <xref rid="ijms-21-06540-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, variability was higher for yield percentages than for BCP percentage. The reason for the yield and BCP variability depends on several factors, including plant part, the quantity of plant material distilled and, most of all, the genetic variability and phenotypic plasticity of plants [
