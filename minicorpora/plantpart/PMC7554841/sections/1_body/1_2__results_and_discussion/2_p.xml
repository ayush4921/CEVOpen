<p>In general, the 295 species belonged to 51 families and were reported from 56 countries worldwide. The essential oil containing BCP was extracted from 13 different plant parts. Out of 295 species, 34 were found to be listed in the Belfrit list, whereas for 51 species no data were available on the yield percentage. In many cases, the researchers used a small amount of plant parts (ranging from a few g to 200â€“300 g) from which it was impossible to evaluate the oil yield. However, in the majority of the other cases the yield was provided and hence reported (
