<p>The binomial name of the species (including the author), the family of belonging, the plant part used, the country of origin of the sample, the yield and the BCP percentages were inserted in a database by using Systat
 <sup>®</sup> 10 software (Systat Software Inc., San Jose, California, U.S.A.). Data were organized in columns and used for further processing. Average values along with ranges, standard deviation (S.D.), standard error of the mean (S.E.M.) and coefficient of variation (C.V.) were calculated by considering as grouping categories either the species, families, country of origin or plant part used. As a classification statistical method, a cluster analysis was calculated by considering for each category the total number of species, the BCP percentage and the yield percentage by using Systat
 <sup>®</sup> 10 software. Euclidean distances were calculated with the average linkage method. Data were plotted as either scatter plots of yield percentage vs. BCP percentage or dendrograms showing the different clusters according to the calculated distance.
