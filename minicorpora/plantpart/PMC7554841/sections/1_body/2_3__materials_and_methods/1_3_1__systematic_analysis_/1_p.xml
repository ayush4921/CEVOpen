<p>After a preliminary search by using different databases, the work was performed by using Clarivate Analytics Web of Science as a database (
 <uri xlink:href="http://apps.webofknowledge.com" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://apps.webofknowledge.com</uri>). The basic search criterion was on the general search for the molecule (caryophyllene), then the exclusion criteria were the presence of BCP and a percentage of BCP in the reported results higher than 10%. Papers reporting the occurrence of BCP where then downloaded and saved as a pdf for further reading and collection of information.
