<p>Scientists from the same research group also studied the effect of light and its absence on the accumulation of secondary metabolites in 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> suspension cultures. The cultures were grown on MS medium supplemented with 1 mg/L TDZ and 1 mg/L NAA. The dynamics of biomass growth were measured during 39-day cultivation cycles. Cultures grown in the presence of continuous artificial light with a radiation intensity of 40 mol·m
 <sup>−2</sup>·s
 <sup>−1</sup> reached their maximum, 3.9-fold, increase in dry biomass on day 30, whereas cultures grown in the dark, a 3.7-fold increase, on day 27 of cultivation. In addition, in vitro cultures grown in the presence of light were found, using UV-VIS spectroscopy methods with the addition of Folin-Ciocalteu reagent, to have elevated levels of phenols, while those with the addition of aluminium chloride—elevated levels of flavonoids. The results of the study showed that appropriate lighting conditions for 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> cultivation had a positive effect on the efficiency of secondary metabolite production [
