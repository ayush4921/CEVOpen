<p>A Hindu research group has developed a protocol for micropropagation of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> by indirect organogenesis. The most effective for callus growth was MS medium with 0.5 mg/L 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and 0.5 mg/L kinetin (Kin). Maximal induction of shoots from callus was found on a medium containing 4.5 mg/L BAP (6-benzylaminopurine) and 0.5 mg/L NAA. With a different quantitative combination of growth regulators, i.e., 1.5 mg/L BAP and 0.5 mg/L NAA, a pronounced induction of many shoots from nodal explants was observed. The most beneficial medium promoting rhizogenesis was one with the addition of 0.5 mg/L indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) [
