<p>Although there are no problems with obtaining 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> from natural habitats or by cultivation, attempts are being made at finding biotechnological solutions. They can undoubtedly bypass the problems associated with the chemical variability of the raw materials derived from the plantâ€”the herb and the essential oil. Biotechnological research to date has been concerned with endogenous production of secondary metabolites and the development of micropropagation protocols.
