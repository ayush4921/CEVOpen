<p>In 2013, one of Pakistani research groups proposed a method of producing 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> secondary metabolites by cultures in vitro. In the first stage aimed at establishing the cultures, they tested the Murashige-Skoog (MS) medium enriched only with the addition of 0.5â€“5.0 mg/L thidiazuron (TDZ), or a combination of TDZ with 1.0 mg/L naphthalene-1-acetic acid (NAA), or with 1.0 mg/L indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). Thus prepared substrates were used to initiate cultures from leaf explants. Callus obtained on MS media supplemented with 1.0 mg/L TDZ and 1.0 mg/L NAA was passaged for biomass growth. Further experiments on the growth and production of secondary metabolites involved the use of suspension cultures established from 35-day callus cultures. Biomass was grown in Erlenmeyer flasks containing MS medium with 1.0 mg/L TDZ and 1.0 mg/L NAA. The biomass was taken for analysis at 3-day intervals during 42-day cultivation cycles. Phytochemical analysis was performed by HPLC. Seedlings from germinating seeds constituted the control sample. The amount of phenolic acids in the suspension was 3.57 mg/g (control: 2.75 mg/g), and the amount of flavonoid compounds was 1.77 mg/g (control: 1.20 mg/g). The results of the study showed that 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> suspension cultures might be a good potential source of phenolic acids and flavonoids [
