 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> is a species rich in compounds that show toxic effects. These are 
 <italic>α</italic>- and 
 <italic>β</italic>-thujone, with 
 <italic>α</italic>-thujone being thought to be two to three times more harmful. The likely mechanism of action of these compounds is interaction with the GABA receptor of chloride channels [

 <xref rid="B16-plants-09-01063" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. These symptoms have been confirmed in studies on laboratory animals (mice). Intraperitoneal injection of 
 <italic>α</italic>-thujone into rodents induced tremors. Convulsions did not occur if diazepam or phenobarbital was administered prophylactically [
