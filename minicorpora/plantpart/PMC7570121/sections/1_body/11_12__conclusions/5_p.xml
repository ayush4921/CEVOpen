<p>Research on biologically active extracts from the herb and/or individual isolated compounds and/or essential oil has drawn attention to the mechanism of action of these raw materials in known classical applications. It has also provided evidence for numerous, very valuable, previously unknown, new directions of biological activity of the raw materialsâ€”antiprotozoal, antibacterial, antifungal, anti-ulcer, hepatoprotective, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, cytotoxic, analgesic, neuroprotective, antidepressant, procognitive, neurotrophic, cell membrane stabilizing, and antioxidant effects.</p>
