<p>Wormwood has always been associated with a very bitter taste. In the Polish language, it is the proverbial quintessence of bitterness (in the popular saying “bitter as wormwood”), but already in ancient Greece it owed its name—
 <italic>α</italic>ψίνθιον, Apsinthion (Latin Apsinthium)—to its not very pleasant taste. Dioscorides (1st century AD) and Theophrastus (4th/3rd century BC) associated it with the Greek words “ápsinthos”—unpleasant, disagreeable, or “ápinthos”—unfit for drinking. In the Germanic literature on herbal medicine, the name “Wermut” appears, indicating the antiparasitic effect of this herb attributed to its bitter taste (“Werm” in Old German means “worm”) [
 <xref rid="B44-plants-09-01063" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In Dioscorides’s 
 <italic>De materia medica</italic>, wormwood, usually taken in the form of tincture, is described as having warming, astringent and stimulating effects, being able to relieve stomach and abdominal pains, and effective against poison [
 <xref rid="B45-plants-09-01063" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Pliny the Elder (1st century AD) also recommends 
 <italic>Absinthium</italic> as a hypnotic, laxative, menstruation-inducing agent, healing “fistulas on the eyes”, and even as a cosmetic—the ash from it combined with a rose ointment “blackens the hair” [
 <xref rid="B46-plants-09-01063" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The therapeutic spectrum of wormwood (
 <italic>Artemisia absinthium</italic>) is very similar to that of mugwort (
 <italic>Artemisia vulgaris</italic>), together with which it has often been described [
 <xref rid="B47-plants-09-01063" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]; compared to mugwort, wormwood has a slightly stronger effect on the digestive system [
 <xref rid="B48-plants-09-01063" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Apart from the characteristic bitterness, another special property of wormwood has been known since antiquity—depending on the dose, it stimulates the central nervous system, causing even epileptic seizures and hallucinations [
 <xref rid="B49-plants-09-01063" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Both Walafrid Strabo in his 
 <italic>“Hortulus”</italic> (9th centuryAD) and Hildegard von Bingen in 
 <italic>“Physica”</italic> three centuries later emphasize the restorative effect of wormwood [
 <xref rid="B50-plants-09-01063" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Hildegard, the famous mystic, saint and Doctor of the Church, praises wormwood as “
 <italic>the most important master against all exhaustions</italic>” [
 <xref rid="B51-plants-09-01063" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The authors of the Renaissance era, describing the therapeutic indications for wormwood, put the main emphasis on ailments of the digestive system. Adam Lonitzer (1551) recommends it for “
 <italic>strengthening the stomach</italic>” and “
 <italic>improving appetite</italic>”, and Leonard Fuchs (1543) for “
 <italic>removing stool, winds, and pain in the gut</italic>”. Nota bene, Fuchs’s work begins with a description of vermouth. Both authors introduce eye compresses, which are to remove eye hyperaemia and improve eyesight [
 <xref rid="B52-plants-09-01063" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,
 <xref rid="B53-plants-09-01063" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The Polish herbals by Stefan Falimirz [
 <xref rid="B54-plants-09-01063" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] and Marcin from Urzędów mention the detoxifying and restorative, as well as curative, effects of wormwood in gastrointestinal, liver, and biliary tract diseases; it was also supposed to cure skin, ear and eye diseases, remove odour from the mouth, and “drive out worms” [
 <xref rid="B55-plants-09-01063" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. A similar application is given in the famous 
 <italic>Herbiarz</italic> (herbal) by Szymon Syreniusz (1613) [
 <xref rid="B56-plants-09-01063" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. In turn, the great work of Tabernaemontanus, 
 <italic>Neuw Kreuterbuch</italic> (1588), in which the description of herbs also begins with vermouth, as part of the development of a holistic way of thinking and treatment in medicine, sees the benefit of the choleretic action of wormwood, both in the treatment of jaundice and “
 <italic>in angry women who are full of bile</italic>” [
 <xref rid="B57-plants-09-01063" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. In the declining years of that philosophy, consistently supplanted by the emerging modern medicine, Joachim Zedler in his 
 <italic>Universal-Lexicon</italic> (1732) praises wormwood mouthwash solutions as able to improve the smell of breath and to strengthen the gums and teeth [
 <xref rid="B58-plants-09-01063" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. This indicates a tendency to rediscover hygiene and to use those properties of wormwood that in evidence-based medicine (EBM) are termed “antiseptic” [
 <xref rid="B59-plants-09-01063" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Based on the essential oil of wormwood, a very popular alcoholic drink—absinthe—was created in the 19
 <sup>th</sup> century, an intoxicant whose excessive consumption leads to irreversible damage to the central nervous system. Because of this effect, modern medicine prohibits the consumption of the ethereic oil obtained from this plant, or any spirit based on wormwood, but sees the benefits of its action on the digestive system in the form of a herb [
 <xref rid="B60-plants-09-01063" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. The folk use of wormwood also deserves a mention: added to washing, its smell is supposed to repel moths, lice, and bed bugs. The same intense smell, also released during the burning of this plant, was the basis of its ritual use in funeral processions and in repelling evil spirits [
 <xref rid="B61-plants-09-01063" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. In folk medicine, wormwood was used for fever, having been poured over with aqua vitae (spirit), or soaked with pepper in vodka, wine or water, and for stomach pain [
 <xref rid="B62-plants-09-01063" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], while in folk veterinary medicine, cooked wormwood was given to cattle to improve their appetite [
