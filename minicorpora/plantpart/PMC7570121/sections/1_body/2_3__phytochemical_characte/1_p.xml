 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> contains numerous compounds responsible for its biological activities. The herb of this species is considered to be the raw material for oil extraction. The essential oil content of the herb varies both qualitatively and quantitatively depending on the geographical region and environmental conditions (
 <xref rid="plants-09-01063-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The concentration of oil in the plant ranges from 0.2% in a dry climate to 1.5% in a humid climate [
 <xref rid="B16-plants-09-01063" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The highest concentration of essential oil in 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> herb is observed in June and July [
 <xref rid="B15-plants-09-01063" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. To indicate the main component of the oil is difficult because the results of phytochemical tests are not conclusive. The most frequently listed compounds are thujyl alcohol esters, 
 <italic>α</italic>-thujone, 
 <italic>β</italic>-thujone, camphene, 
 <italic>α-</italic>cadinene, guaiazulene (
 <italic>Z</italic>)-epoxyocimene, (
 <italic>E</italic>)-sabinyl acetate, (
 <italic>Z</italic>)-chrysantenyl acetate [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01063-f001">Figure 1</xref>). It has been noted that among populations growing in areas above 1000 m a.s.l. 
 <italic>α</italic>-thujone is the characteristic compound, while (
 <italic>Z</italic>)-epoxyocimene dominates below this height [
