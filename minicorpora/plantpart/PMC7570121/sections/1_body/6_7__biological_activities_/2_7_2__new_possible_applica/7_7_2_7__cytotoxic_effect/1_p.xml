 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> extracts have also been tested for anti-tumour activity. A methanolic extract from the herb of the plant was used to treat breast cancer cells of the MDA-MB231 line (non-oestrogen-responsive line) and MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma cells (oestrogen-responsive line). After three days of exposure, a 50% inhibition of MDA-MB231 cell proliferation at 20 g/mL and a 50% inhibition of MCF-7 cells at 25 g/mL were demonstrated. Based on the results obtained, it was concluded that 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> might be a potential source of new compounds limiting the development of breast cancer and breast adenocarcinoma [
