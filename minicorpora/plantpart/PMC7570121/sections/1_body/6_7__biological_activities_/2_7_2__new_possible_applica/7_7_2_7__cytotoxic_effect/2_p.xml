<p>The cytotoxicity of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> essential oil has also been tested. In vitro studies were performed on six cell lines: A548 (lung adenocarcinoma cell line), NCI-H292 (non-small-cell lung cancer cell line), HCT116 (colon cancer cell line), MCF-7 (breast adenocarcinoma cell line), SK-MEL-5 (melanoma cell line), and HS5 (bone marrow stromal cell lineâ€”control). After multiplying the cells in the medium, their reaction to 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> essential oil and its individual fractions was examined. The tested lines were found to be sensitive to the essential oil and/or its individual fractions in a dose-dependent manner, with the best effect observed against the SK-MEL-5 and HCT116 lines, and the weakest against the MCF-7 line. The authors of the study associate the occurrence of the cytotoxic effect mainly with the presence of (
 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene and/or germacrene D because of the high concentration of these compounds in the oil [
