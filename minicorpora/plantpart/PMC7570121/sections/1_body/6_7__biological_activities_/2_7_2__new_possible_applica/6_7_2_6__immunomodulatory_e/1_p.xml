<p>Extracts from 
 <italic>Artemisia absinthium</italic> have also been the subject of research on their immunomodulatory activity. One experiment examined whether 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> extract had an effect on the maturation of dendritic cells in laboratory mice. Dendritic cells were treated with an ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> herb for 18 h and then examined in a flow cytometer. The extract was found to have a positive effect on dendritic cell maturation by increasing the level of surface expression of CD40 protein, which acted as a marker co-stimulating dendritic cells and the induction of cytokines. The study also assessed the degree of proliferation of allogeneic T-lymphocytes using a mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) and enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA). During the MLR, allogeneic T-lymphocytes were mixed with dendritic cells isolated from the mice treated with the 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> herb extract. It was found that at 100 Î¼g/mL of extract the proliferation of T-lymphocytes was reduced by 78.2% relative to the control. A significant increase in IL-10 levels was also observed. The obtained results may serve to justify the traditional use of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> in immune disorders [
