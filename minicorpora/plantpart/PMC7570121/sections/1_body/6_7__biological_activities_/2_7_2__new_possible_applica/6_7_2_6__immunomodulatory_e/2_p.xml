<p>Another study proved that polysaccharides isolated from 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> herb showed immunostimulatory activity by inducing TH1 response and stimulating nitric oxide production by mouse peritoneal macrophages [

Bactericidal macrophages and Tc-lymphocytes are activated, and IgG class antibodies are produced, which activate the complement system. IL-2 interleukins and interferon-γ are also produced [
