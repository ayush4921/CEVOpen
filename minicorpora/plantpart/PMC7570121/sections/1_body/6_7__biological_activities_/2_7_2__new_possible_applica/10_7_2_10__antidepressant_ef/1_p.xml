 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> has also been tested as a plant with potential antidepressant activity. For this purpose, the forced swim test and the tail suspension test were carried out on mice. In the first test, 125, 250, 500, or 1000 mg/kg methanolic extract of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> was injected intraperitoneally into the mice from the study group. A positive control group received 5 or 10 mg/kg imipramine solution, and a negative control group a 0.9% saline solution. The rodents were placed in a cylinder filled with water and the duration of immobility was measured during the last four minutes of the experiment. The 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> extract significantly shortened the period of animalâ€™s immobility compared to the negative control group. The effect observed with an extract dose of 1000 mg/kg BW was comparable to the effect after application of 5 mg/kg imipramine. The second test consisted in hanging the mouse by its tail. After initial vigorous movements, periods of immobility during a five-minute observation were recorded. The results of the second test showed that the 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> extract significantly and in a dose-dependent manner reduced the time of immobility of the mice, and that the effect caused by the 500 mg/kg dose of the extract represented the same antidepressant activity as that of imipramine [
