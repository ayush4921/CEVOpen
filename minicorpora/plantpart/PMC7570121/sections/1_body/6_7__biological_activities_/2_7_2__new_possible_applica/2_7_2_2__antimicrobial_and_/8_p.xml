<p>In recent years, the attention of scientists has been directed towards the search for new strategies to overcome antibiotic resistance of individual strains of bacteria. One of the methods of increasing the sensitivity to antibiotics is the simultaneous use of substances that inhibit the activity of membrane efflux pumps (EPI—Efflux Pump Inhibitor). Such compounds prevent the removal of the drug from inside the bacteria and increase the effectiveness of therapy [

 <italic>A. absinthium</italic>, with particular emphasis on the effect of caffeoylquinic acid derivatives on the ability to inhibit pump activity in Gram-positive bacteria. Pathogens such as 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> were tested. The results revealed at least two active compounds isolated from 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic>—chlorogenic acid, whose antimicrobial activity was low, and 4,5-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid, which caused inhibition of pump activity in Gram-positive bacteria. The obtained data indicate that 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> may be a source of substances capable of reducing the antibiotic resistance of pathogens [
