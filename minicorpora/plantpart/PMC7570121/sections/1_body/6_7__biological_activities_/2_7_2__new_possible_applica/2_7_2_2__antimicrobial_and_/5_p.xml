<p>There has also been a study on the effect of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> on the fungi 
 <italic>Fusarium moniliforme, F. oxysporum fs. lycopersici</italic> and 
 <italic>F. solani</italic>. Antifungal activity was determined by the diluted agar method with the addition of 0.05 mg/mL methyltetrazolium salt. The percentage inhibition of colony growth was adopted as the measured value. The tests involved checking the activity of essential oil derived from cultivated 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> plants, from wild plants in natural habitats, and from commercial oils. The best activity was shown by a commercial oil and one of the cultivated populations. Seven of the fifteen oils tested were active against 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>, six oils against 
 <italic>F. solani</italic>, and only two against 
 <italic>F. moniliforme</italic>, below ED
 <sub>50</sub> = 1 Î¼g/mL. Authors claimed that the strongest effects were found for thujone free cultivated 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> plants [
