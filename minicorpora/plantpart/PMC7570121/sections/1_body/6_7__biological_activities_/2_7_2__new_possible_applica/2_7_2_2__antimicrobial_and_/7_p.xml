<p>Still other experiments using the diffusion-disc method examined the activity of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> essential oils against the bacteria: 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (strains sensitive and resistant to methicillin) and 
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, and the fungi: 
 <italic>Fusarium graminearum, F. culmorum, F. oxysporum, Sclerotinia</italic> sp. and 
 <italic>Rhizoctonia solani</italic>. The essential oils tested in the experiment had been extracted from plants harvested in various parts of Tunisia; however, the results showed that habitat location had no influence on the effects produced by the oils. The strongest antibacterial activity was obtained against a methicillin-sensitive strain of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, for which the diameter of growth inhibition was as large as 25 mm (inhibition zone for the positive control, tetracycline, was also 25 mm). For the methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, the largest inhibition zone was 16 mm, while for 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> it was a maximum of 20 mm (positive control—24 mm). In terms of antifungal activity, the oil was observed to have a significant effect on 
 <italic>F. graminearum, F. culmorum</italic> and 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>. The essential oil extracted from a plant collected in the area of Jerissa (city located in the north-eastern part of Tunisia) proved to be additionally active against 
 <italic>Sclerotinia</italic> sp. and 
 <italic>Rhizoctonia solani</italic>. The authors of the study attributed the antibacterial and antifungal activities to the main component of the oil—chamazulene, but indicated that further research was needed [
