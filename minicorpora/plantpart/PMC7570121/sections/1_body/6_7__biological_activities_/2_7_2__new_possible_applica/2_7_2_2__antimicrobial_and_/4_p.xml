<p>A subsequent study tested the effectiveness of a hydro-alcoholic extract from the herb of A. absinthium against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Bacillus subtilis, B. cereus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus. The experiment used the diffusion-disc method and the parameter determined was the diameter of the growth inhibition zone. The A. absinthium extract showed an activity against all the pathogens except K. pneumoniae. With a 750 mg/mL dose of the extract, the inhibition zone was 11.9 mm for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 18.4 mm for Haemophilus influenzae, 14.4 mm for Bacillus subtilis, 20.4 mm for B. cereus, and 15.9 mm for Staphylococcus aureus [
