 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> is a species that can probably be used also in patients with postoperative wound infections caused by 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. This is indicated by the results of tests carried out on rats that were cut on their back and the wound was infected with 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. The wound was treated topically with a hydro-alcoholic extract of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> herb. The number of bacteria in the test group was 3 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cfu/wound, while in the control group 7 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cfu/wound. The extract showed significant bactericidal effectiveness, which the authors attribute to the compounds found in the essential oil of the plant [
