<p>The analgesic properties of extracts from 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> have been confirmed in the writhing test and the hot plate test with mice in other studies. Before conducting the two tests, rodents were given 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> essential oil at doses of 2, 4, or 8 mg/kg, or an aqueous extract from the leaves of the plant at doses of 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg. There was a significant reduction in writhing episodes in the writhing test and a longer delay in pain response in the hot plate test compared to the control with morphine, which may confirm the analgesic profile of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> [
