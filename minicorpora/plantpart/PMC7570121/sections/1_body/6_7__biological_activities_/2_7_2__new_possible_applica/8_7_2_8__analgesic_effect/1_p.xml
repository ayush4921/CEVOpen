<p>As part of other experiments, in parallel with the testing of anti-inflammatory activity, as described above, 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> was also evaluated for its analgesic effect. The following scheme of the experiment was used: the methanolic extract of the herb of the plant was administered orally to the mice in the study group, at doses of 300 mg/kg, 500 mg/kg or 1000 mg/kg. A positive control group received 300 mg/kg acetylsalicylic acid, while a negative control group received a 0.9% sodium chloride solution. The analgesic effect was assessed based on the delay in withdrawing the tail from water heated to 51 Â°C. A rapid onset of analgesic action was seen at all doses, but it was less pronounced compared to that of acetylsalicylic acid. As in the study of anti-inflammatory activity, it was found that 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> could produce analgesic effects, but more experiments were required [
