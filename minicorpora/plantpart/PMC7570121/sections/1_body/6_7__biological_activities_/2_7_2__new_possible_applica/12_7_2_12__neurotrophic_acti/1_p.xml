<p>A study on the effects of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> herb extract on the nerve growth factor (NGF) in PC12D cells (cell line of rat pheochromocytoma tumour) has also been conducted. Three types of extract from the plantâ€”methanolic, ethanolic, and aqueous, were tested. All of them showed neurotrophic activity, increasing neurite development through NGF induction. The strongest effect was proven for the methanolic extract, followed by the ethanolic one, while the aqueous extract produced a weak effect. The obtained results indicate that extracts from 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> herb may gain significance in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders [
