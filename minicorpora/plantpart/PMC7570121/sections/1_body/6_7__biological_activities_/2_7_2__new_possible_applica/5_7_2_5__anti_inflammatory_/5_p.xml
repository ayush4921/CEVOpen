<p>Cardamonin—a chalcone isolated from 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic>, has been tested for its potential anti-inflammatory activity. To this end, the effect of cardamonin on lipopolysaccharide-induced release of nitrites and expression of iNOS and COX-2 proteins was assessed on two cell lines: THP-1 (monocyte cell line of acute monocytic leukaemia) and RAW 264.7 (cell line of mouse macrophages). Using the western blot technique, the compound was also tested for its effect on phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAP): the ERK, JNK, and p38 MAP kinases, and on the activation of the NFĸB pathway. The results showed inhibition of NO release and inhibition of iNOS expression, depending on cardamonin concentration, which led to the suppression of inflammation. The compound had no effect on the expression of COX-2, phosphorylation of MAP kinases, or phosphorylation of NFĸB. There was, however, inhibition of the NFĸB pathway by direct inhibition of DNA transcription factor. Induction of IFN-γ activated iNOS was also inhibited [
