<p>Researchers from four research centres were successful in isolating from 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> the flavonoid—5,6,3′,5′-tetramethoxy-7,4-hydroxyflavone (p7F), which was tested in in vitro and in vivo models for anti-inflammatory effects. The compound was tested for its effects on the production of nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), tumour necrosis factor (TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>), as well as for the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and its effect on collagen-induced arthritis. It was found that p7F inhibited the expression of iNOS and COX-2, and also reduced the production of PGE2 and NO in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated cells of the RAW 264.7 line (cell line of monocytes and macrophages). After administering p7F to the mice in which inflammation had been induced by collagen, there was a decrease in the level of TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> and inhibition of the NF-κB pathway. The compound also prevented intracellular accumulation of reactive oxygen species. The results suggest that p7F isolated from 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> may find use in the treatment of inflammatory diseases [
