<p>Another new direction of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> activities under investigation was the anti-inflammatory activity. In one study, a methanolic extract from the herb of the plant was given orally to mice at doses of 300 mg/kg, 500 mg/kg, and 1000 mg/kg. A positive control group received 300 mg/kg acetylsalicylic acid, while a negative control group received a 0.9% sodium chloride solution. All of the mice were then intravenously given carrageenan, which induced an inflammatory response. Anti-inflammatory activity was estimated volumetrically by measuring rodent paw volume using a plethysmometer. There was a 41% reduction in oedema volume, but it was short-lived, less intense and delayed compared to the effect of acetylsalicylic acid. The authors of this work do not exclude that 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> has a significant anti-inflammatory effect; however, further studies are needed [
