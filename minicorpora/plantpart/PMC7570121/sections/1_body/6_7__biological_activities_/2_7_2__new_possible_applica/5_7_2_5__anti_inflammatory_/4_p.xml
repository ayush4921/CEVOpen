<p>In 2010, a randomized clinical trial was conducted that examined the effect of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> extract on the plasma level of tumour necrosis factor (TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>), which is a marker of ongoing inflammation in the course of Crohn’s disease (ChL-C). Patients with ChL-C who were included in the study were divided into two groups of ten. The control group continued standard therapy and received a placebo. The study group, in addition to standard therapy, took orally 250 mg of dried, powdered 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> herb extract three times a day for six weeks. The absinthin content in a single dose was 0.32–0.38%. The patients had their plasma TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> levels measured just before starting the treatment, then after three weeks and after six weeks. In the study group, there was a decrease in TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> concentration from the initial value of 24.5 pg/mL to 8.0 pg/mL after six weeks. In the control group, the value of 25.7 pg/mL (week 0) dropped to 21.1 pg/mL (week 6). The change in Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) was also assessed and it was found to have decreased from 275 to 175 in the group of patients treated with 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic>, and from 282 to 230 in the group receiving the placebo. Based on the conducted research, it can be assumed that 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> may be an effective plant in the treatment of inflammatory diseases in which elevated TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> concentration is observed [
