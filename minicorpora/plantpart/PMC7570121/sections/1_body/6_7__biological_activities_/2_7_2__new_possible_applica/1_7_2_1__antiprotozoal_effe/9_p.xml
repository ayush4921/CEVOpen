<p>As part of subsequent, newer studies (2011), the use of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> in the treatment of leishmaniasis caused by 
 <italic>Leishmania infantum</italic> infection was also examined and, additionally, the effectiveness of plant extract in the treatment of Chagas disease caused by 
 <italic>Tripanosoma cruzi</italic> was also investigated. The ED
 <sub>50</sub> value and the percentage of inhibition of protozoan growth after addition of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> extracts were tested. The tested extracts had a strong antiprotozoal effect. To find the compounds responsible for this activity profile, the flavonoids—casticin and artemetin, and the sesquiterpenoid lactone—hydroxypelenolide, were tested; unfortunately, none of the tested compounds showed significant lethal effects [
