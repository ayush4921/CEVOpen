<p>A further study conducted in 2010 confirmed also the antimalarial action of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic>. The in vitro study performed on chloroquine-resistant (K1) and chloroquine-sensitive (CY27) strains of 
 <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> grown with human erythrocytes showed that a hydro-ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> herb exhibited significant antimalarial activity. IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were determined after the plant extracts had been administered by the lactate dehydrogenase method. They were 0.46 μg/mL for the K1 strain and 0.195 μg/mL for the CY27 strain.
