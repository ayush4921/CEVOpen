<p>One experiment (in 1990) examined the antimalarial effect of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> on an animal model. Erythrocytes (1 Ã— 10
 <sup>7</sup>) infected with 
 <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic>, the malaria-causing protozoan, were intravenously administered to mice. After seven days, the rodents were given leaf extracts of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic>. The aqueous extract was given only orally, while the ethanolic extract was given orally, subcutaneously, or intraperitoneally. All the extracts produced a reduction in parasitemia, but the best inhibition effect of 96.2% was obtained with the ethanolic extract at a dose of 74 mg/kg. The results of the study showed that preparations with 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> could be an effective agent in the treatment of malaria [
