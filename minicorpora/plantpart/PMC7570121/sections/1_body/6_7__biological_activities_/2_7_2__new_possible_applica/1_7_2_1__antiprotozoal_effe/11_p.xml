<p>Some other experiments focused on 
 <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> and 
 <italic>Trichomonas vaginalis</italic> (vaginal trichomonad that causes trichomoniasis). The essential oil obtained from 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> was divided into nine fractions. All of the tested fractions showed lethal activity against both protozoa. After examining the quantitative and qualitative compositions of the fractions showing the highest activity (fraction VLC1 and VLC2), it was found that (
 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene and 3,6-dihydrochamazulene may be responsible for the antiprotozoal profile due to their high amounts in these fractions.
