<p>Another study looked at the use of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> in leishmaniasis. The essential oil was isolated from the plant and tested for its ability to control the protozoa—
 <italic>Leishmania aethiopica</italic> and 
 <italic>L. donovani</italic>. The results of the study showed an activity that inhibited the development of these microorganisms. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for both microorganisms in the promastigote form was 0.1565 μL/mL, while for amphotericin B the value of MIC was 0.0244 μL/mL. The EC
 <sub>50</sub> (half maximal effective concentration) value determined for the amastigote form was 42 nL/mL for 
 <italic>L. donovani</italic> and 7.94 nL/mL for 
 <italic>L. aethiopica</italic>, with amphotericin as the control, for which the EC
 <sub>50</sub> was 0.018 μL/mL and 0.047 μL/mL, respectively. The results of the study may indicate that the compounds contained in 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> can be potential, effective agents for the treatment of leishmaniasis [
