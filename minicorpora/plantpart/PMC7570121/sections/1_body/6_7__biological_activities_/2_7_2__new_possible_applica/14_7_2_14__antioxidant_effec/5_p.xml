<p>Antioxidative properties of methanolic extracts of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> herb were also tested using the DPPH method with plants harvested from various regions of Tunisia. The results indicated that the effectiveness of the antioxidant activity of the extracts was related to the location of the habitat from which the plants were harvested. The strongest effect was found for extracts from the herb of plants collected in the northern part of Tunisia (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 9.38 mg/mL). The second test method tested the reduction potential for iron (III). Herb extracts were able to reduce iron(III) ions regardless of where the plants had been harvested; moreover, the EC
 <sub>50</sub> values obtained were lower than for the ascorbic acid control [
