<p>In one experiment, the antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> was tested using the DPPH method. The plant material was extracted by successively using solvents of different polarity (70% methanol, petroleum ether, chloroform, ethyl acetate, n-butanol). It was demonstrated that the antiradical activity depended on the type of solvent and the concentration of extracts. The best results were obtained using the acetate extract, then the extracts produced with methanol, n-butanol, chloroform, and ether. The authors of the study concluded that the concentration of phenols and flavonoids influenced the antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> [
