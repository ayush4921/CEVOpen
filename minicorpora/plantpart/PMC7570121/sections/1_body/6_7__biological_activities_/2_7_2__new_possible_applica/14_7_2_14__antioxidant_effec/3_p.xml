<p>As part of another experiment, several tests were performed to test the activity of a methanolic extract from 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> herb. In the DPPH test, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value for radical scavenging activity was 612 μg/mL. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values for ascorbic acid, quercetin and butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) used as controls were 1.26 μg/mL, 1.32 μg/mL and 13.49 μg/mL, respectively. The methanolic extract from 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> also showed a reduction potential in the reaction with iron (III) ions, where the effect was proven to depend on the concentration of the extract. Evidence was also found for a good capacity to chelate iron(II) cations. The capacity for scavenging nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen peroxide (H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>) was also tested. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> value for nitric oxide was 1.77 mg/mL and for quercetin (as a positive control) the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value was 17.01 μg/mL. The 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> extract also showed the ability to scavenge H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, where the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value was 24.3 μg/mL, while for control samples with ascorbic acid and BHA these values were IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 21.4 μg/mL and IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 52.0 μg/mL, respectively. Flavonoids (12.4 mg quercetin equivalent/g extract) and phenolic compounds (194.9 mg gallic acid equivalent/g extract) were isolated from the tested extract. The tests prove that the significant antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> is determined by the considerable concentrations of flavonoids and phenolic compounds [
