<p>A subsequent study examined in vitro the activity of scavenging superoxide anions, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxy radicals and nitric oxide, as well as the reduction potential of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> herb extracts. In addition, an in vivo study was performed in which, after giving a methanolic extract of the plant to mice, bilateral carotid artery occlusion was performed, reperfusion was restored, and then the superoxide dismutase activity, concentration of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and glutathione content were determined by colorimetric methods. The results of the tests in vitro showed significant antioxidant activity in relation to all the compounds tested. In vivo, significant inhibition of oxidative stress was found in the central nervous system after oral administration of 100 or 200 mg/kg of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> herb extract. The amount of TBARS also decreased and the concentrations of superoxide and glutathione dismutases increased, which indicates the possibility of using extracts of the plant as an antioxidant [
