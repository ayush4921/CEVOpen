<p>Further studies assessed the role of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> aqueous extract in the neuroprotection of the brain during prolonged exposure to lead. Among the group of rats that had been exposed to lead, the number of dopaminergic neurons in the 
 <italic>substantia nigra</italic> decreased by 50%, and the number of astrocytes in the frontal cortex increased by 48%. It was proved that a four-week treatment of rodents with an aqueous extract of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> at a dose of 200 mg/L reversed most of the lesions occurring in glia and in the dopaminergic system [
