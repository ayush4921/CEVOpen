<p>The results of another study indicate that the neuroprotective effect of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> may be associated with the anti-inflammatory activity of the sesquiterpenoid dimer—caruifolin D, present in the plant. In the experiment, this compound significantly inhibited the production of neuro-inflammatory mediators in BV2 microglial cells. By inhibiting the production of reactive oxygen species, caruifolin D also showed antioxidant activity; a decrease in protein kinase C and stress-activated kinases (JNK) was also demonstrated. The authors of the study proved that caruifolin D in 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> had neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory potential. The researchers proposed this compound as potential for use in the treatment of inflammatory neurological diseases such as Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s [
