<p>The neuroprotective potential of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> has also been assessed. To this end, an experiment was designed in which obstruction of the middle cerebral artery in rats was caused with a nylon thread. After 90 min, the thread was removed and the normal blood perfusion restored for 24 h. The temporary closure of the middle cerebral artery led to infarction, lipid peroxidation, reduction in glutathione levels, and a decrease in the activity of catalase and superoxide dismutase. There was a lack of locomotor coordination and short-term memory impairment among the tested rats. An attempt was made to reduce the losses by prophylactic oral administration of 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg methanolic extract from the herb of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic>. The results proved to be promisingâ€”there was evidence of a reduction in oxidative stress, in the extent of brain damage, and in behavioural disorders, which indicates that extracts from 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> herb may be a potential agent in the prevention of stroke [
