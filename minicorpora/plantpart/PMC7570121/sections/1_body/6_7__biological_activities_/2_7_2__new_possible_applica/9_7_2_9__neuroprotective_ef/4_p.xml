<p>One of the latest studies (2016) focused on the neuroprotective potential of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> herb extracts in the oxidative stress caused by mercury. Damage in rat brains was induced by oral administration of mercury (II) chloride (HgCl
 <sub>2</sub>) at a dose of 5 mg/kg. The rodents were then given 500 mg/L aqueous 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> extract. A significant decrease in malondialdehyde (MDA) was recorded—by 26.99% in the cerebellum, by 31.81% in the cerebral cortex, and by 80.70% in the striatum; induction of catalase activity in the cerebellum was also evident. The plant extract also restored the activity of antioxidant enzymes—superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and thioredoxin HgCl
 <sub>2</sub> reductase [
