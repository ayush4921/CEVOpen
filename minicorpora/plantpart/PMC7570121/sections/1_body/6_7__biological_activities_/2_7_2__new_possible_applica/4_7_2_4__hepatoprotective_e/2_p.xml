<p>In 2016, another experiment confirming the hepatoprotective effect of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> was conducted. Twenty male rats, after being divided into four equal groups, received by gavage, respectively, a saline solution, or 10, 50 or 100 mg/kg/day powdered methanolic extract from 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> herb. Samples of rodent blood were then taken and liver indicator levels compared with control samples (before using the extract and saline solution). The best results were obtained for a dose of 50 mg/kg, at which a significant decrease in the levels of alanine aminotransferase and asparagine aminotransferase was found. Taking advantage of the capacity for reducing iron (II) ions, the antioxidant properties were also measured, which increased significantly in rats receiving the extract at 50 mg/kg. The study thus proved the hepatoprotective properties of wormwood extracts [
