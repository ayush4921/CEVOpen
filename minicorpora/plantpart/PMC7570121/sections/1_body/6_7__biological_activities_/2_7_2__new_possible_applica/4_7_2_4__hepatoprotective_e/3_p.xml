<p>Evidence confirming the protective effect of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> on liver cells has been provided by further experiments conducted on mice. In these laboratory animals, liver damage was induced by administering carbon tetrachloride, or immunologically by injecting lipopolysaccharide. The rodents were given an aqueous extract of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic>. The results were very promising: significant reduction in the levels of liver enzymes, inhibition of lipid peroxidation, and restoration of the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in both chemically and immunologically induced liver damage. In addition, a significant reduction in the number of pro-inflammatory mediators—TNF
 <italic>α</italic> and IL-1, was observed in the immunological model. Histopathological and other liver tests also showed a reduction in the number of inflammatory cells [
