<p>Another new direction of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> activity studied has been the hepatoprotective activity. Experiments were conducted to investigate the protective effect of a hydro-methanolic extract from 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> herb on hepatocytes in rats. Liver damage in the animals was caused by the administration of acetaminophen (paracetamol) and carbon tetrachloride. After prophylactic two-day administration of the plant extract at a dose of 500 mg/kg BW, reduced levels of asparagine and alanine aminotransferases were found in the serum, in comparison with the control group. There was also a 20% reduction in mortality due to acetaminophen administration. In the next stage of the study, 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> extracts were tested to verify if they could be used to reduce liver damage after administration of acetaminophen and carbon tetrachloride. Acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity was significantly reduced after three doses of extract at 500 mg/kg, but administering them did not affect carbon tetrachloride-induced damage. Attempts were thus made to explain the hepatoprotective mechanism of action of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic>. To this end, the effect of the plant extract on the duration of sleep induced by pentobarbital in mice and mortality induced by strychnine were investigated. Evidence was found of sleep prolongation and increased mortality, suggesting inhibition of the activity of liver microsomal enzymes [
