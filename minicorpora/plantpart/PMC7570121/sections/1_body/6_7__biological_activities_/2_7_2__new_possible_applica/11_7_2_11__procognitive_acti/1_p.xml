<p>A study was conducted to check whether the historically known use of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> in the treatment of memory disorders and reduced concentration was justified. Because it was known that cholinergic receptors were involved in cognitive functions, the study examined the activity of the binding of compounds extracted from 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> to muscarinic and nicotinic receptors. Ethanolic extracts from two batches of harvested plants were applied to the prepared homogenate of human cortical brain cells; the ability to displace [3H]-(N)-nicotine and [3H]-(N)-scopolamine from the receptors was determined. The results of the study showed that 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> had significant affinity for both muscarinic and nicotinic receptors, meaning that preparations from the plant can show procognitive effects [
