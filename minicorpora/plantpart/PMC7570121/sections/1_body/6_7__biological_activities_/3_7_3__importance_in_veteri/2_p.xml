<p>One of the experiments examined whether 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> had a stimulating effect on appetite in sheep. A flock of sheep (16 animals) was divided into four groups; in each of them the animals had a different diet. The animals in the first group received 300 g/kg dry matter (DM) basic concentrates and 700 g/kg DM rice straw. In the second group, 50 g/kg DM straw was replaced with silage containing 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic>; in the third group this was 100 g/kg DM, and in the fourth group 150 g/kg DM silage. The results of the study showed that enriching the diet of sheep with 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic>-containing silage significantly increased the amount of feed consumed. Improved digestion, increased nitrogen retention, and an increase in the number of microorganisms involved in the assimilation of nitrogen were also observed [
