<p>A study attempted to confirm the mechanism responsible for the increased secretion of digestive juices after the application of preparations containing 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic>. The experiment was conducted with the participation of volunteers who received encapsulated cellulose water (control group) or an ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> herb (study group). The participants had their cardiovascular parameters tested before and after ingestion. It was found that in the control group the strength of heart contraction and arterial pressure increased, while among the study group given 1500 mg of wormwood tincture, a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance and reduced cardiac output were observed. In the control group, induction of gastric digestion occurred by increasing the strength of heart contraction. By comparison, the consumption of bitter compounds induced the gastric phase by increasing peripheral vascular resistance associated with the activation of the sympathetic nervous system. A change in postprandial haemodynamics in the gastric phase of digestion along with increased blood supply was reported as a likely mechanism for stimulating digestion [
