<p>The same parasite was the object of further research. In the first of the experiments, 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> essential oil was applied to a suspension containing 
 <italic>T. spiralis</italic> larvae, and after 24 h their infectivity was checked by giving them to mice. Seven days after infection, the rodents were sacrificed and the number of adult worms in the intestinal mucosa was counted. Using the essential oil at 1 mg/mL, up to 99.99% larvicidal effectiveness was achieved.
