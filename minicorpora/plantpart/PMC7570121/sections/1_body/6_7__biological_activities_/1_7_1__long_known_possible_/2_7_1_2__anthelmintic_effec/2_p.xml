<p>One of the experiments examined the effects of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> on 
 <italic>Trichinella spiralis</italic> (trichina worm). Methanolic extracts from the herb of the plant were administered to rats suffering from trichinosis. After sacrificing the rodents, samples of their muscles were subjected to trichinoscopic examination and artificial digestion. Both methods determined the number of larvae in muscle tissue. Using 300 g/kg of 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> extract, the percentage of larvae during the intestinal phase of the disease decreased by 63.5% in the tongue, by 37.7% in the diaphragm, by 46.2% in the quadriceps muscles, and by 60.5% in the biceps and triceps [
