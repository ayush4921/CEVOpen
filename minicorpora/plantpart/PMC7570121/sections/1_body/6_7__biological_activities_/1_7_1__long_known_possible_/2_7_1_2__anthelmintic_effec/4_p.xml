<p>In another experiment, a group of mice were orally infected with 
 <italic>T. spiralis</italic> larvae. A day later, the animals were given 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> essential oil. After 7 days, the animals were sacrificed and the isolated small intestines were incubated to obtain adult forms of parasites and to count them. The best nematocidal effect was observed at a dose of 500 mg/kg of body weight, at which the reduction in the number of larvae was 66.07%. A positive control with albendazole showed a 65.97% reduction in the number of larvae [
