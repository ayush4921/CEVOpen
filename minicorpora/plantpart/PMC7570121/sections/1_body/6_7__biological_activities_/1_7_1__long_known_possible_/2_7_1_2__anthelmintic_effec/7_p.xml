<p>One study evaluated the effectiveness of an aqueous and an ethanolic extract from 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> against 
 <italic>H. contortus</italic>. The study involved a parasite motility inhibition test (in vitro), which demonstrated the direct effect of the extracts on adult nematode individuals, and a test for reducing the number of parasite eggs in host faeces (in vivo). In the motility test, both extracts showed a significant anthelmintic effect, with the ethanolic extract being more effective than the aqueous one. In an in vivo study carried out on sheep, the ethanolic extract on day 15 of the experiment showed a decrease in the number of faecal eggs by 90.46% for a dose of 2 g/kg BW and 82.85% for a dose of 1 g/kg BW. The aqueous extract proved to be less active also in this test. The maximum reduction in egg count of 80.49% was observed at a dose of 2 g/kg BW. The likely reason for the greater activity of the ethanolic extract from 
 <italic>A. absinthium</italic> may be the better solubility in alcohol of the compounds responsible for the anthelmintic effect [
