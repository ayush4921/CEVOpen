0: The extraction step is crucial in isolating the desired components from a complex biological matrix.
1: There are conventional methods, including hydrodistillation, cold-pressed extraction, and, sometimes, solvent-based extraction; however, their greatest disadvantage is the time-consuming and low efficiency extraction, which results in high production costs.
2: On the other hand, it is possible to use modern extraction methods (e.g., enzyme-assisted extraction, enzyme digestion, microwave-assisted extraction, pressurized liquid extraction, pulsed electric field extraction, supercritical fluid extraction, ohmic heating, and ultrasound-assisted extraction) that reduce the limitations of conventional methods.
3: Nevertheless, supplying energy to the extraction system reduces target thermolabile biocomponents.
4: The use of cold press is therefore not only an eco-friendly method, but also has an advantage over unconventional extraction methods in terms of product quality [ 8].
