<p>Chemokines constitute a family of chemoattractant cytokines. These are small heparin-binding proteins involved in atherosclerosis by promoting directed migration of inflammatory cells. Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), also known as monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), has been detected in atherosclerotic lesions [
