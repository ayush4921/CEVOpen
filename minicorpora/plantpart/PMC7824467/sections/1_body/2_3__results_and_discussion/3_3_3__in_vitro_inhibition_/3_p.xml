<p>Reports regarding the action of essential oils and/or their main components on the production of CCL2 are scarce. Limonene isolated from 
 <italic>Citrus junos</italic> EO was able to inhibit CCL2 production on diesel exhaust particle (DEP)-stimulated human eosinophilic leukemia HL-60 clone 15 cells [

 <italic>Artemisia argyi</italic> EO, mainly constituted by 1,8-cineole (33%), camphor (17%), (‑)‑borneol (13%) and α‑thujone (13%), reduced TNF-α, IL-6, IFN-β and CCL2 in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophages [

 <xref rid="B77-plants-10-00050" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>] also reported that (‑)‑linalool was able to inhibit microglial migration induced by CCL2, a chemokine released by oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) in cortical cells from 17-day-old embryos of Sprague-Dawley rats.
