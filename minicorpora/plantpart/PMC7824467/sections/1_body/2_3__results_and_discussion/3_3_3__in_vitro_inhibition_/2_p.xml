<p>Of the four essential oils with the ability to inhibit CCL2 release, only 
 <italic>L. luisieri</italic> EO had remarkable activity, with inhibition percentages of 23 ± 1%, 54 ± 3% and 82 ± 12% at 10, 30 and 90 µg/mL, respectively (
 <xref rid="plants-10-00050-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The major compound of 
 <italic>L. luisieri</italic> EO, 5-methylene-2,3,4,4-tetramethylcyclopent-2-enone, a necrodane derivative, may have contributed to this activity, along with 1,8-cineole. Nevertheless, the absence of the activity of other EOs in which 1,8-cineole was also present, even in a much higher percentage, such as 
 <italic>Th. mastichina</italic> or 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> EOs (
 <xref rid="plants-10-00050-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), may suggest that 5‑methylene-2,3,4,4-tetramethylcyclopent-2-enone plays an important role in the inhibition of both TNF‑α and CCL2 release (

 <italic>D. ambrosioides</italic>, 
 <italic>S. virgaurea</italic> or 
 <italic>B. huillensis</italic> EOs were much lower (
