<p>Gas chromatographic analyses were performed using a Perkin Elmer Clarus 400 gas chromatograph equipped with two flame ionization detectors (FIDs), a data handling system and a vaporizing injector port into which two columns of different polarities were installed: a DB-1 fused-silica column (polydimethylsiloxane, 30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., film thickness 0.25 µm; J &amp; W Scientific Inc., Rancho Cordova, CA, USA) and a DB-17HT fused-silica column ((50% phenyl)-methylpolysiloxane, 30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., film thickness 0.15 µm; J &amp; W Scientific Inc.). The oven temperature was programmed from 45 to 175 °C, at 3 °C/min, and subsequently at 15 °C/min up to 300 °C, and then held isothermal for 10 min; injector and detector temperatures were 280 °C and 300 °C, respectively; the carrier gas, hydrogen, was adjusted to a linear velocity of 30 cm/s. The samples were injected using a split sampling technique, ratio 1:50. The volume of injection was 0.1 µL of 
 <italic>n</italic>-pentane-essential oil solution (1:1). The percentage composition of the volatiles was computed, by the normalization method from the GC peak areas, and calculated as the mean values of two injections, from each sample, without using the response factors.
