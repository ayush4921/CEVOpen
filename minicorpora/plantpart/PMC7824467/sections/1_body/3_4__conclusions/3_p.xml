<p>EOs’ chemical complexity and variability (existence of chemotypes and/or the enantiomeric ratio of some components), their hydrophobicity and, sometimes, their scarcity, have been considered some of the limitations to their use in diverse formulations. Nevertheless, EOs are Generally Regarded as Safe (GRAS), and the knowledge on their biological properties should be further explored, in solo formulations and in combination therapies, as potential anti-inflammatory agents. This approach would contribute to the goal of decreasing the use of SAIDs and, therefore, preventing or diminishing these drugs’ adverse side effects.</p>
