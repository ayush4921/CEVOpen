<p>In general, there were no major differences in morphology between camphor trees of different chemotypes, and the trees were therefore initially classified by odor alone. Fresh leaves of the six samples were harvested, and the essential oils were obtained by water distillation. The average oil outputs of the samples from linalool- and low-oil-yield chemotypes were 1.3 and 0.3%, respectively. Chemical composition of the extracted essential oils was determined by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS). 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> lists the major components detected, 1–15 are monoterpenes, and the remaining are sesquiterpenes. In the essential oils of the linalool type, β-linalool was the principal constituent, making up ∼90% in average. Among the various constituents of the essential oils extracted from the different chemotypes of camphor trees, the major difference was observed for the monoterpene content. Therefore, transcriptome analyses between trees of linalool type and trees with low oil yield were performed to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the biosynthesis of monoterpenes.
