<p>To construct a genome-wide transcriptome of 
 <italic>C. camphora</italic>, total RNA of the experimental samples was isolated. This pooled total RNA was sequenced and a total of 87.9 M 150 bp paired-end reads remained after raw reads were processed with sequence filtering and quality control (

 <italic>De novo</italic> assembly was carried out with short reads using Trinity (see section “Materials and Methods”). A total of 121,285 unigenes were assembled with a high N50 value (1063), as well as high values for both the maximum unigene length (15,713) and percentage of mapped reads (&gt;98%), indicating a good assembly quality (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In addition, BUSCO analysis was performed to assess the completeness of the final genome assembly. Based on the 1,440 embryophytic-specfic genes, 79.8% were identified as complete genes, including 76.3% complete and single-copy genes and 3.5% complete and duplicated genes, and 8.8% were identified as fragmented genes, indicating good completeness of the genome assembly (
