<p>Functional annotation of 121,285 
 <italic>C. camphora</italic> unigenes was performed by comparing unigene sequences to the protein databases Nr and Swissprot with an 
 <italic>E</italic>-value threshold of 1e
 <sup>–5</sup> using BLASTx analysis. This analysis yielded a total of 50,545 annotated genes, with 34,789 unigenes in common between two databases (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). A total of 49,295 unigenes had significant hits in the Nr database. Further GO annotation analysis assigned the 49,295 unigenes to three main categories, including biological process, cellular component, and molecular function (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Within the biological process, “metabolic process” was highly represented (29.5%) followed by “cellular process” (24.1%). Within the cellular component, “cell” (23.7%), “cell part” (23.7%), and “organelle” (16.0%) were most represented. Similarly, “catalytic activity” and “binding” were the most dominant terms under molecular function, accounting for 55.4 and 36.1%, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS3">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). To systematically analyze the metabolic pathways of unigene products in cells and predict the function of these unigene products, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis was performed, and 11,111 unigenes were annotated and classified into 19 metabolic pathways. The category “Global and Overview” included the largest number of unigenes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>), among which “metabolic pathways” and “biosynthesis of secondary metabolites” were dominant, accounting for 40.8 and 22.2%, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS4">Supplementary Table S4</xref>). Additionally, 359 unigenes were placed into the category “metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides,” which included “terpenoid backbone biosynthesis” (32.3%), “monoterpenoid biosynthesis” (5.0%), “diterpenoid biosynthesis” (13.4%), “sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis” (5.0%), “carotenoid biosynthesis” (15.3%), “brassinosteroid biosynthesis” (8.9%), “zeatin biosynthesis” (8.4%), and “limonene and pinene degradation” (11.7%) (
