<p>Leaves from five randomly selected 3-year-old tree clones of each chemotype were collected for quantitative reverse transcriptase (RT)–PCR analysis. Total RNA was extracted and reverse-transcribed into cDNA using the HiScript II Q RT SuperMix for quantitative PCR (qPCR) (Vazyme, China). The PCRs were performed using ChamQTM SYBR
 <sup>®</sup> qPCR Master Mix (Vazyme, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions on an ABI Step One Plus System with three replicates. Sequences of the gene-specific primers are listed in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>. Relative gene expression was calculated using the 2
