<p>Total RNA was extracted from samples using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, United States) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Next, gDNA was removed using DNase I digestion (Qiagen, United States). The integrity of extracted RNA was determined by the RNA Nano 6000 Assay Kit of the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, United States). Extracted RNA was sent to Gene 
 <italic>Denovo</italic> Biotechnology Co. (Guangzhou, China) for cDNA library preparation and sequencing. Up to 1 μg of total RNA from each sample was used for library construction using the NEB #7530 kit for Illumina
 <sup>®</sup> (New England Biolabs, United States), as described by the manufacturer. mRNA was first enriched by oligo(dT) beads and fragmented into small fragments using fragmentation buffer and reverse-transcribed into cDNA with ProtoScript II Reverse Transcriptase and random primers. Second-strand cDNA was synthesized by DNA polymerase I along with RNase H, dNTP, and buffer. Next, cDNA fragments were purified with 1.8 × Agencourt AMPure XP Beads, end-repaired, and ligated to Illumina sequencing adapters after addition of poly(A) tails. Ligated fragments were subjected to size selection by gel electrophoresis and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified. The resulting cDNA library was sequenced using Illumina HiSeq
 <sup>TM</sup> 4000.
