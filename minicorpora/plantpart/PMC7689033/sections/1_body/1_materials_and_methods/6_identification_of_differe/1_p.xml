<p>Expression values of each gene were calculated as reads per kilobase (of exon) per million (RPKM) mapped reads. Biological samples with low and high oil contents were grouped, and comparison was undertaken to identify DEGs between the two experimental groups. Principal component analysis (PCA) was also performed as a quality control. DEGs with a fold change â‰¥ 2 and
