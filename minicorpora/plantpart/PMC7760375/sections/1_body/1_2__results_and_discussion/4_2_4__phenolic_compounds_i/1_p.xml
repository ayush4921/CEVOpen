<p>Phenolic compounds in hydrosols were analyzed for better explanation of antioxidant activity of the hydrosols. Vanillin, cinnamic acid, and protocatechuic acid (3, 4-dihydroxybenzoic acid) were confirmed. All three compounds were found in hydrosol of plants collected in Kamešnica (KS). In hydrosols of PS (from Prenj), polyphenolic compounds were not detected (
 <xref rid="plants-09-01646-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). In all analyzed samples from Kamešnica, protocatechuic acid was the most abundant compound, with an average concentration of 7.33 ± 0.35 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup>. Phenolic compounds generally have a protective role in plants and in their acclimatization to environmental conditions, so that the difference between detected phenols in PS and KS hydrosols can be attributed to exposure to different stresses (i.e., water stress). Concentrations of vanillin and cinnamic acid ranged from 0.11 mg to 0.22 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup>. The average vanillin concentration was 0.22 ± 0.01 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup> and that of cinnamic acid was 0.12 ± 0.02 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup>. Low amounts of polyphenols were expected due to their insolubility in water. In four types of 
 <italic>V. spicata</italic> plant extracts (methanol, ethyl-acetate, water at 25 °C, and water at 45 °C), cinnamic acid and vanillin were not confirmed [

 <italic>V. teucrium</italic> and 
 <italic>V. jacquinii</italic> [
