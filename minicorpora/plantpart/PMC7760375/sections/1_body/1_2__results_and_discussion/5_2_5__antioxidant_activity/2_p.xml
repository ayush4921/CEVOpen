<p>We have also tested the most abundant compound in EOs hexahydropharnesyl acetone with DPPH and ORAC methods, and it did not show any antioxidant activity, so we can assume that the antioxidant activity comes from another compound in EO, or is probably the result of synergistic work between different compounds. Synergistic activity has been demonstrated in some studies. Amorati et al. tested and compared the antioxidant activity for 5 different EOs, their hydrocarbon and oxygenated fractions and also for two compounds characteristic for these EOs, thymol and carvacrol. The results showed that in 4 out of 5 samples, the total oil has a higher antioxidant activity than its fractions, and in 3 out of 5 samples, the total oil has a higher activity than isolated single active compounds, so that we can conclude that the synergy between different compounds in the essential oil plays a crucial role in its activity [

From our results, we can also conclude that the activity does not originate from the most abundant compound, but from the interplay between all compounds from the EO. Our previous research showed similar results with phenolic extracts, since for 
 <italic>V. spicata</italic>, it was shown that there is a negative correlation between the amount of phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity, so that it was concluded that other substances such as terpenoids and proteins may have an influence on antioxidant activity [
 <xref rid="B9-plants-09-01646" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. We have shown that 
 <italic>Veronica</italic> species have free volatile compounds (terpenoids) and that they have antioxidant activity. Other potential biological activity such as antimicrobial, antiviral and antiproliferative should be carried out to give better insight into the full potential of using these compounds in pharmacy or food preservation.
