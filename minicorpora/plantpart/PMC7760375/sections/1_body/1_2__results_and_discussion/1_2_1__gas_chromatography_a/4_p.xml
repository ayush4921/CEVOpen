<p>The presence of hydrocarbons is significant, especially in the oil PS where pentacosan dominates with 6.28%. Sesquiterpenes (E)-caryophyllene and caryophyllene oxide were identified in both oil samples. Caryophyllene oxide is particularly present in the PS oil with 20.25%, while it is almost ten times less present in KS oil (2.34%). Sesquiterpenes are also significantly represented and dominate in the analyzed hydrosols. The proportion of identified (E)-caryophyllene in the hydrosol samples (24.52% and 12.35%) is significantly higher than in the oil samples, followed by allo-aromadendrene (8.13% and 11.53%) and germacrene D (2.56% and 4.67%), while caryophyllene oxide is least present in the hydrosols samples (

 <italic>-</italic>1(7),8-dien-2-ol in the analyzed hydrosol samples, methyl eugenol was significantly present with 13.35% in the PS hydrosol and 11.92% in the KS hydrosol. Phenylpropanoids such as methyl eugenol and identified Z-methyl isoeugenol (1.25% and 4.16%) occur in plants under stress conditions, such as ultraviolet radiation and pathogen attack [
