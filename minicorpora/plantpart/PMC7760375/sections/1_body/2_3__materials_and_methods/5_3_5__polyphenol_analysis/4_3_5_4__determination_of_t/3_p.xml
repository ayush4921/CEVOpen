<p>TPA content, expressed as chlorogenic acid (λ = 525 nm), was calculated from the equation:
 <disp-formula>A × 5.3/m; [A = absorbance; m = mass of the substance to be examined (g)]
  <label>(4)</label>
 </disp-formula> where 5.3 represents the conversion factor related to the specific absorbance of chlorogenic acid at 525 nm (i.e., 188).
