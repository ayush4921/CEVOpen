<p>TF included hydrolysis of glycosides (extraction of 0.20 g of powdered plant material with acetone, 25% HCl and 0.5% hexamethylenetetramine, using boiling water bath for 30 min), then extraction of total flavonoid aglycones with ethyl acetate, and complexation with AlCl

 <xref rid="B52-plants-09-01646" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Absorbance of the yellow complex was measured at 425 nm and concentration was calculated as quercetin using the following equation:
 <disp-formula>% = A Ã— 0.772/b; [A = absorbance; b = mass of dry plant material (g)]
  <label>(2)</label>
 </disp-formula> where b is mass of the dry plant material (g) and 0.772 represents the conversion factor related to the specific absorbance of quercetin at 425 nm (i.e., 810). TF concentration was measured in three independent analyses and expressed as mg/g of dry weight of herbal material.
