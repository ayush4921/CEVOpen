<p>The identification of phenolic compounds in the hydrosols was performed by comparing the retention time with that of the pure standard. The quantification of the phenolic compounds was performed using the calibration curve of the standard and the results were expressed in mg of each phenolic compound per L of the sample. The standard and solvents were of analytical grade, and were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany). Deionized water (Milli-Q) was used for the preparation of all solvents.</p>
