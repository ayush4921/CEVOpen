 <italic>Veronica</italic> (family Plantaginaceae) is a very large and versatile plant genus, rich in biologically active specialized metabolites. In this research, free volatile compounds and their antioxidant activity were studied for the first time in 
 <italic>V. saturejoides</italic> ssp. 
 <italic>saturejoides</italic> from the two localities. The main volatile compounds in essential oils were hexahydrofarnesyl acetone and hexadecanoic acid. The main volatile compound in hydrosols was trans-1(7),8-p-mentadien-2-ol. For the genus 
 <italic>Veronic</italic>a, the most studied specialized metabolites are iridoid glycosides, because of their importance in phylogeny and phenolic compounds, which have a great antioxidant activity. Our research showed that essential oils exhibit stronger antioxidant activity than hydrosols. Comparing the results from phenolic compounds in dry material of other investigated 
 <italic>Veronica</italic> species with the results of phenolic and volatile compounds of this 
 <italic>Veronica</italic> species, we can conclude that essential oils and hydrosols are valuable sources of potentially biologically active compounds. Free volatile compounds of the genus 
 <italic>Veronica</italic> are only just being studied and we believe that such compounds have great potential as antioxidants in pharmacy and food technology.
