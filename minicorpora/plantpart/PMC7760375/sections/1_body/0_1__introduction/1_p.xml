<p>The genus 
 <italic>Veronica</italic> L. is the largest within the order Lamiales (family Plantaginaceae) with about 450 species. The extreme variability in morphology and the very good adaptation to the different living conditions of this genus has allowed it to be widely distributed on a wide range of habitats, from aquatic, swamp and forest habitats to rocks, cracks, fields and ruderal habitats [
 <xref rid="B1-plants-09-01646" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Most representatives grow in areas with a Mediterranean climate [
 <xref rid="B2-plants-09-01646" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Between 30 and 40 species of the genus 
 <italic>Veronica</italic> have been described in Croatia [
 <xref rid="B3-plants-09-01646" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], but the species studied in this research is the only endemic species. 
 <italic>Veronica saturejoides</italic> Vis. ssp. 
 <italic>saturejoides</italic> grows on the rocks in the Dinaric Mountains in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro. There are two other subspecies of this plant, one from Albania, 
 <italic>V. saturejoides</italic> ssp. 
 <italic>munellensis</italic>, and one from Bulgaria, 
 <italic>V. saturejoides</italic> ssp. 
 <italic>kellereri</italic> [
