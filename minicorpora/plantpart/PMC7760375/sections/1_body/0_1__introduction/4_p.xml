<p>We now know that plants are exposed to many stresses in their environment. Due to their sedentary lifestyles, they develop specialized metabolites in response to these extreme weather conditions [
 <xref rid="B14-plants-09-01646" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] (for this plant, drought and high levels of sunlight due to growing on mountain peaks) and biological stress such as pathogen infection. Specialized plant metabolites have all kinds of biological activities that can be used in medicine, pharmacy and food preservation, as microorganisms become increasingly resistant to synthetic compounds. These synthetic compounds (e.g., BHA-butylated hydroxyanisole) can also be carcinogenic when used in canned foods [
 <xref rid="B9-plants-09-01646" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], therefore the search for safe natural food preservatives goes on and this research contributes to the study of natural products as potential antioxidants in food preservations. What is more, it is basic research on the bioactive compounds of
