0: Genus  Veronica has been extensively phylogenetically investigated and the relationship between the distribution of iridoid glycosides and phylogeny has been reported [ 6, 7].
1: Flavonoid and phenolic compounds have also been extensively studied, probably because of their importance for the biological activity of plants.
2: These compounds are known to have anti-allergenic, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, cardioprotective and vasodilator properties and, above all, antioxidant and radical scavenging potential [ 8].
3: Species of the genus  Veronica are used in traditional medicine for the treatment of various diseases, including influenza, respiratory diseases and cancer, and as diuretics [ 9] because of their natural richness in phenolic compounds and iridoids.
4: In recent years, some research has shown that species from this genus could also be used to treat mental disorders [ 10] and some types of diabetes [ 11].
