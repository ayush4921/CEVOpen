0: The genus  Veronica L. is the largest within the order Lamiales (family Plantaginaceae) with about 450 species.
1: The extreme variability in morphology and the very good adaptation to the different living conditions of this genus has allowed it to be widely distributed on a wide range of habitats, from aquatic, swamp and forest habitats to rocks, cracks, fields and ruderal habitats [ 1].
2: Most representatives grow in areas with a Mediterranean climate [ 2].
3: Between 30 and 40 species of the genus  Veronica have been described in Croatia [ 3], but the species studied in this research is the only endemic species.
4: Veronica saturejoides Vis.
5: ssp.
6: saturejoides grows on the rocks in the Dinaric Mountains in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro.
7: There are two other subspecies of this plant, one from Albania,  V. saturejoides ssp.
8: munellensis, and one from Bulgaria,  V. saturejoides ssp.
9: kellereri [ 4].
10: V. saturejoides Vis.
11: ssp.
12: saturejoides is a perennial crawling plant, which grows 10-30 cm long and has elongated, somewhat lignified roots.
13: It has a hairy stem which is woody at the base.
14: The leaves are simple, opposite each other, 69 mm long, have an integrated edge and are not or only slightly hairy on the leaves.
