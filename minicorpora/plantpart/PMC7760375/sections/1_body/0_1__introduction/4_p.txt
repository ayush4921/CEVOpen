0: We now know that plants are exposed to many stresses in their environment.
1: Due to their sedentary lifestyles, they develop specialized metabolites in response to these extreme weather conditions [ 14] (for this plant, drought and high levels of sunlight due to growing on mountain peaks) and biological stress such as pathogen infection.
2: Specialized plant metabolites have all kinds of biological activities that can be used in medicine, pharmacy and food preservation, as microorganisms become increasingly resistant to synthetic compounds.
3: These synthetic compounds (e.g., BHA-butylated hydroxyanisole) can also be carcinogenic when used in canned foods [ 9], therefore the search for safe natural food preservatives goes on and this research contributes to the study of natural products as potential antioxidants in food preservations.
4: What is more, it is basic research on the bioactive compounds of  Veronica genus.
