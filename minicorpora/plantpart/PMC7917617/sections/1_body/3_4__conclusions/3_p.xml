<p>Our results encourage us to continue investigation into the possible mechanism of action of carvacrol, especially against 
 <italic>A. baumannii</italic>, which is causing an increasing number of deaths in vulnerable patients. In addition, the EO of 
 <italic>L. pubescens</italic> can be further studied for its use as an alternative natural approach to lowering the spread of infectious diseases during large gatherings and pilgrimages, such as Hajj. Furthermore, it could be of interest to verify a possible synergistic effect between the pure constituents of EOs and a number of antibiotics.
