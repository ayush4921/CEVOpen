<p>The flavonoids present in the aerial parts of 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> were evaluated for estrogenic activity by three scientific institutions from USA and South Korea in cooperation. 
 <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> fungi containing an expression plasmid with the cDNA of the human estrogen receptor and a reporter plasmid with the α-galactosidase gene was used in the experiment. The estrogenic effect, 5% relative to 17-β-estradiol, was observed in the polar extract (extraction with ethyl acetate), whereas the less polar ethanolic extract showed no activity. After testing the individual flavonoids of the plant, it was observed that the transcription of the reporter gene was significantly induced by eriodictyol and apigenin. The activity was also found to be concentration-dependent [
