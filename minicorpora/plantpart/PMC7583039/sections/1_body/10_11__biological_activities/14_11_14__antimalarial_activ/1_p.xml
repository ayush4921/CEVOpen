<p>Kodippili et al. from Sri Lanka investigated the antimalarial (both antiparasitic and antidisease) activity of the 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> extract. They assessed the antiparasitic activity of the extract at three doses (250, 500, and 1000 mg/kg) in vivo in the 
 <italic>Plasmodium yoelii</italic> rodent malaria model, using distilled water as the negative control and Coartem as the positive control. In the 4-day suppressive assay, the oral administration of the extract at 500 and 1000 mg/kg significantly inhibited parasitemia by 65.16% and 51.46%, respectively. The antinociceptive activity of the extract was analyzed using the hot plate test, which indicated a central, supraspinally mediated response in relieving pain. The antidisease activity of the extract was further corroborated by the increased survival of the infected mice treated with the 500 mg/kg dose. The 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> extract was well tolerated by the mice over a period of 14 days (assay of subchronic toxicity), with no overt signs of toxicity or stress. Hepatotoxicity (evaluated in terms of the serum levels of glutamic–oxaloacetic transaminase and serum glutamic–pyruvic transaminase), renotoxicity (in terms of serum urea and creatinine), and hematotoxicity (in terms of total RBC, WBC, and differential leukocyte counts) were also ruled out. Based on these findings, the authors concluded that 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> leaf extract is orally active and nontoxic, and that 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> is a weed with the potential to act as a cheap source of the antimalarial plant [
