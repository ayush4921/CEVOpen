<p>A methanolic extract prepared from the aerial parts of 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> was tested by Turkish teams to analyze its cytotoxic effects on human cancer cell lines (MCF7—estrogen-dependent breast adenocarcinoma cell line, A549—non-small cell lung cancer cell line, HeLa—cervical cancer cell line), and normal cell lines (A7R5—vascular smooth muscle cell line, 293T—human embryonic kidney cell line transformed with SV40 large T antigen). Cytotoxic activity was assessed by real-time electrical impedance measurements. A statistically significant inhibitory effect was observed against MCF7 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 190 ng/mL), HeLa (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 284 ng/mL), A7R5 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 382 ng/mL), and 293T (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 317 ng/mL), whereas a weak influence was found on A549 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 778 ng/mL) cells [

 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> plant, and characterized its growth inhibitory effects on cancer cells. The results demonstrated that the essential oil-induced apoptosis in HL-60 leukemic cell line was mediated by caspase-dependent pathways, involving caspase-3, -9, and -8, which were initiated by Bcl-2/Bax/Bid-dependent loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, leading to the release of cytochrome c to the cytoplasm to activate the caspase cascade. The results showed that the studied essential oils were more efficient in inducing apoptosis in different cancer cell lines than noncancerous cells. Based on these observations, the authors suggested that 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> might be a promising source of new anticancer agents [
