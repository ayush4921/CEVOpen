<p>The latest study from 2020 was performed by a Serbian team on methanolic extracts of the 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> plant. The researchers proved the genotoxic and cytotoxic activities of the extracts, both separately and in co-treatment with a known mutagen (mitomycin C). They used the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay for measuring the micronucleus frequency in human peripheral blood lymphocytes and MTT assay as the proliferation test in SW-480 human colon cancer cells and human periodontal ligament stem cells used as control. The results of the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay showed that both extracts significantly increased the micronucleus frequency in the peripheral blood lymphocytes treated with the 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> extract at all the tested concentrations (10, 50, 100, and 250 μg/mL), except the lowest one (10 μg/mL). The extracts induced cytotoxic activity only in co-treatment with mitomycin C after long-term exposure and did not significantly affect the viability of the human periodontal ligament stem cells. The researchers indicated that these activities were induced by the flavonoids and other phenolic compounds present in the plant [
