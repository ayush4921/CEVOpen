<p>A group of researchers in Cardiff (UK) tested the extracts prepared from the herb of 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> for their activity toward biogenic amine receptors in the smooth muscles of the gastrointestinal tract and respiratory tract of guinea pigs. The antagonistic effects of chloroform and methanol extracts were determined using concentration–response curves for contractions of the trachea and the small intestine under the influence of 5-hydroxytryptamine, methacholine, histamine, and phenylethylamine. The team found that both extracts had an antagonistic effect on the H1 receptors and caused the relaxation of smooth muscles. Two main compounds were isolated from the chloroform fraction—yomogin and 1,2,3,4-diepoxy-11(13)-eudesmen-12,8-olide—of which the former showed significant antagonism toward the H1 receptor in the ileum [
