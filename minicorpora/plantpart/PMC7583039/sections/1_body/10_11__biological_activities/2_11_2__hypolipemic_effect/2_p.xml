<p>The hypolipidemic and anti-inflammatory effects of the 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> extract were studied in hypercholesterolemic rats by a Chinese team. They induced hypercholesterolemia in rats by feeding them with a high-fat diet containing 3% cholesterol in olein oil, for 8 weeks. This led to a significant increase in the serum levels of triglycerides, TC, LDL cholesterol, malondialdehyde, NO, and tumor necrosis factor-α and a significant decrease in the serum level of HDL cholesterol, activity of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase in the liver, and activity of paraoxonase-1 as compared to the normal control group. Treatment of rats with 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> extract at a dose of 100 mg/kg per day for 4 weeks normalized the serum lipid profile, significantly increased the paraoxonase-1 activity, and decreased the serum levels of malondialdehyde, NO, and tumor necrosis factor-α as compared to the high-fat diet-treated animals. Moreover, the extract caused a decrease in the activity of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase as compared to both high-fat diet-treated animals and control ones [
