<p>In 2008, scientists from Cairo (Egypt) evaluated for the first time the antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic>. They found that the aqueous extract of the herb was able to scavenge 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radicals at IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 11.4 μg/mL and nitric oxide (NO) radicals at IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 125 mg/mL in the first part of the experiment. They also estimated total phenols, flavonoids, and flavonols as 19 ± 0.16 mg/g gallic acid equivalents and 7.96 ± 0.76 and 3.4 ± 0.0 mg/g rutoside equivalents, respectively. In the second part of the experiment, they observed a significant increase in the levels of ascorbic acid and glutathione, and an increase in the activity of superoxide dismutase in the blood of rats administered with the extract at a dose of 100 mg/kg body weight (BW). The results of the study showed that 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> exhibits antioxidant activity and can thus be helpful to treat oxidative stress-related diseases [
