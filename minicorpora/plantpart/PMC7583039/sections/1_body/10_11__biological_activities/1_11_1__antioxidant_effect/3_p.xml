<p>Various modern techniques have been applied in the above studies. Oyedemi and Coopoosamy proved the strong antioxidant potential of the extracts of 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> obtained from South Africa based on lipid peroxidation, protein glycation, xanthine oxidase, and the sTable DPPH radical scavenging assays [
