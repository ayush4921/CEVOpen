<p>The insecticidal activity of 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> was studied by a Hindu team from Tiruchirappalli in India. They exposed the larvae of 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> (Egyptian mosquito, dengue virus vector) to various concentrations of the essential oil extracted from the 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> herb. Even at a low concentration of 10 ppm, insecticidal activity was observed after 24 h, while the best results were seen at a concentration of 500 ppm, where after 8 h of exposure to the oil solution, the larvae mortality rate was 100%. Thus, the study showed that the essential oil of 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> might serve as a potential insecticide [
