<p>Khan and Gilani tested the antispasmodic, bronchodilatory, tracheorelaxant, and antidiarrheal activities of the crude extract of 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> in the isolated tissue preparations of rabbit jejunum and guinea pig trachea, and also analyzed the in vivo castor oil-induced bronchodilation. They found that the 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> extract exhibited a combination of anticholinergic and Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> antagonist mechanisms, which seemed pharmacologically promising for the treatment of airways disorders. The authors supposed that alkaloids, coumarins, flavonoids, saponins, sterols, tannins, and terpenes are the compounds responsible for the concentration-dependent (0.03â€“10 mg/mL) broncholytic effect of the 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> extract [
