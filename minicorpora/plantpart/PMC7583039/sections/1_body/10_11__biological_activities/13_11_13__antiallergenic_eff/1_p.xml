<p>Olsen et al. from Denmark studied the specificity and efficacy of immunotherapy with 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> extracts on 25 patients having seasonal rhinoconjunctivitis for more than two years and only two clinically important allergiesâ€”either to 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> and 
 <italic>Betula verrucosa</italic> or to 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> and 
 <italic>Phleum pratense</italic>. Twenty patients completed two years of specific immunotherapy. Nine patients were treated with the extracts of 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> and 11 with the extracts of either 
 <italic>B. verrucosa</italic> or 
 <italic>P. pratense</italic>. Treatment with 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> was followed by a significant decrease in skin and eye sensitivity to 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> but not to 
 <italic>B. verrucosa</italic> or 
 <italic>P. pratense.</italic> No significant decrease was observed in medicine consumption or symptom scores. The patients treated with 
 <italic>B. verrucosa</italic> or 
 <italic>P. pratense</italic> experienced a significant decrease in skin and eye sensitivity to these organisms, but not to 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic>, and showed a significant decrease in medicine consumption and symptom scores in the 
 <italic>B. verrucosa</italic> or 
 <italic>P. pratense</italic> season but not in the 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> season. The treatment was both effective and specific, with one unexplained exception that both patient groups (
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> and 
 <italic>B. verrucosa</italic> or 
 <italic>P. pratense</italic>) experienced decreased skin sensitivity to 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> [
