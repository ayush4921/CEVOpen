<p>El-Tantawy from Pakistan tested the anti-inflammatory and hypolipidemic effects of 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> extract in hypercholesterolemic rats. Hypercholesterolemia was induced in the rats by feeding them with a high-fat diet containing 3% cholesterol in olein oil, for 8 weeks. Treatment of these rats with 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> extract at a dose of 100 mg/kg per day for 4 weeks normalized the serum lipid profile, significantly increased the paraoxonase-1 activity, and decreased the serum levels of malondialdehyde, NO, and tumor necrosis factor-Î± as compared to the animals that received only high-fat diet. Moreover, the extract caused a significant decrease in the activity of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase as compared to both high-fat diet-treated animals and control ones [
