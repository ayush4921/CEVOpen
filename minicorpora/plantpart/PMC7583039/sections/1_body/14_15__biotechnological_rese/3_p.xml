<p>In 2013, the same group of scientists developed a protocol for regenerating 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> from encapsulated somatic embryos (so-called somatic seeds). The plant development was observed to be best when encapsulation was done with a 2% alginate solution cured for 30 min in a 75 mM calcium chloride solution. It was proved that the encapsulated embryos of 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> could be stored at 4 째C, 20 째C, and 22 째C for 4 months. These embryos showed the highest (90%) efficiency of conversion into microplants at 22 째C on MS medium containing 1.5 mg/L GA
 <sub>3</sub>, 0.5 mg/L IAA, and 40 mg/L ascorbic acid [
