<p>At the University of Mysore in Karnataka (India), Sudershana et al. [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-25-04415" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] investigated the effect of different phytohormone concentrations on the micropropagation of 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> in 2010. They used young leaf explants and the Murashige-Skoog (MS) medium enriched with 1 mg/l 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) and 3 mg/L 1-naphthylacetic acid, which proved optimal for inducing callus growth. The callus was then transferred to a medium containing 1 mg/L BAP and 3.0 mg/L gibberellic acid (GA
 <sub>3</sub>), which was found to be optimal for shoot development. The addition of indolylacetic acid (IAA) at 0.5â€“1 mg/L induced root development [
