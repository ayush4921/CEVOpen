<p>Due to its widespread occurrence, 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> was well known in ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome. According to ancient belief, its name is derived from the name of the Greek goddess Artemis, who is the patron of pregnant women and newly delivered mothers. Because of its beneficial effects on menstruation- and pregnancy-related ailments, 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> had great importance in the religious rites devoted to the goddesses Isis, Artemis, and Diana. The healing properties of this species were described in medical works in as early as the 1st century A.D. by Dioscorides in “

 <italic>De simplicium medicamentorum facultatibus</italic>” [

 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic>, called “
 <italic>mater herbarum</italic>” (the mother of herbs), was used externally for treating wounds, against gout, and to remove leg fatigue, as well as in an attempt to treat fever [

 <italic>inter alia</italic>, the invention of printing by J. Gutenberg, the holistic medicine flourished in Europe, lasting until the 18th century. At that time, in addition to women’s diseases, the therapeutic spectrum of 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> was expanded to include spleen and liver diseases. Additional recommendations appeared “for enlarged and distended spleen” [
