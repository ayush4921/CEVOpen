<p>The species 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> shows high morphological variability depending on the place of occurrence [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-25-04415" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Comparative studies conducted between different populations revealed variability in the branching (presence or absence and extent), leaf shape, and root diameter of the plant [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-25-04415" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The high variability of 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> has been confirmed by the study conducted by Barney and DiTommaso on two populations collected from different, geographically isolated areas of Ithaca (USA). The authors found that plants from one population had densely hairy stems and light green leaves, each with a few deep notches, whereas those collected from another part of the city had almost smooth stems and dark green leaves with many deep notches [
