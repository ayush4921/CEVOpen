<p>In the essential oil extracted from the aerial parts of 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic>, no tricyclic sesquiterpenoids were detected. The dominant compounds that were identified in the study were 1,8-cineole (28.9%), sabinene (13.7%), β-thujone (13.5%), and β-caryophyllene oxide (6.5%), but these were absent in the underground parts of the plant. Based on these findings, the authors concluded that the differences in the chemical composition of the oils extracted from the root and aerial parts might indicate the coexistence of different biogenetic pathways in the plant species [
