<p>Various groups of compounds can be distinguished in 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic>, including sesquiterpenoid lactones, flavonoids, coumarins, phenolic acids, sterols, polyacetylenes, carotenoids, vitamins, and cyanogenic glycosides. Essential oil is another important substance found in the plant. Due to the high intraspecific diversity and discrepancies in the chemical composition of the plant determined by using various test methods, it is difficult to indicate a distinct phytochemical profile for 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-25-04415" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. A characteristic feature of this species is the presence of sesquiterpenoid lactones, including psilostachyin, psilostachyin C, and vulgarin (

In addition, the presence of flavonoidsâ€”derivatives of kaempferol and quercetin, and coumarin compounds, such as esculin, umbelliferone, and scopoletin, is a distinguishing attribute of the plant (
