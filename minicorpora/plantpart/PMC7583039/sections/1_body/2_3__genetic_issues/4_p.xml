<p>In most cases, differences in the 2C values of about sevenfold have been detected between the species. These are directly related to the polyploidization events [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-25-04415" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], which reflects the high genetic plasticity of the genus 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic>. This phenomenon is also seen in all the major groups of this genus. In diploids, the chromosome number is most often 2
 <italic>n</italic> = 18 or 16, but ploidy levels of up to 16Ã— have been reported. The highest chromosome number known is 144, and aneuploidy is frequent as well [
