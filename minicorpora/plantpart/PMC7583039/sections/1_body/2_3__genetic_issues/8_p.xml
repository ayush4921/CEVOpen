<p>The distribution of heterochromatin varies between taxa. The population of 
 <italic>A. vulgaris</italic> is characterized by centromeric or pericentromeric heterochromatin. The cytogenetic data, especially those related to the heterochromatin, may be helpful in understanding the role played by polyploidy in the evolution of the genus 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic>. The diploid and tetraploid taxa were identified to have different chromosome structures: the tetraploid species studied showed two types of heterochromatin (AT- and CG-rich), whereas the diploids showed only the GC-rich regions [
