 <caption> Left, arrangement of experimental arenas for simultaneous tracking of responses from individual bed bugs to essential oil constituents. Right, an example of tracks of bed bugs avoiding fresh residues ( A), or residues aged for 24 h ( B). ( C) is tracks of a bed bug interacting with a control arena (acetone-treated area); red tracks represent approximation of the bed bug to the acetone-treated area, indicating that the insect did not exhibit avoidance behavior. </caption>
