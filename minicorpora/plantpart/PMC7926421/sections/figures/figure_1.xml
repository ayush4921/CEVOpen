 <caption>
  <p>Left, arrangement of experimental arenas for simultaneous tracking of responses from individual bed bugs to essential oil constituents. Right, an example of tracks of bed bugs avoiding fresh residues (
   <bold>A</bold>), or residues aged for 24 h (
   <bold>B</bold>). (
   <bold>C</bold>) is tracks of a bed bug interacting with a control arena (acetone-treated area); red tracks represent approximation of the bed bug to the acetone-treated area, indicating that the insect did not exhibit avoidance behavior.
