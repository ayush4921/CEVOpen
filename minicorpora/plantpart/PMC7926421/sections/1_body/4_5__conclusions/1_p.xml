<p>Bed bugs have behavioral mechanisms that reduce their exposure to EOCs. These avoidance responses, and their implications for potential use in bed bug control programs, may vary depending on several factors including, type of EOC, age of residues, and the presence of other stimuli in the environment. Our findings suggest that novel essential oil-based formulations that include geraniol, eugenol, carvacrol, and citronellic acid have the potential to protect personal belongings. Development of potentially efficacious oil-based formulations for bed bug control might also include evaluations of higher concentrations of EOCs, and synergistic effects of mixtures of constituents.</p>
