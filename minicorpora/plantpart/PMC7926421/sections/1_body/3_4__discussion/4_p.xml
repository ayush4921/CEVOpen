<p>Recent electrophysiological studies on bed bug’s thoracic ganglions have shown that, while linalool triggered neuroexcitatory responses, carvacrol, thymol, eugenol, and citronellic acid had neuroinhibitory effects [

Avoidance behavior to EOCs might also be due to sensorial detection of their volatile constituents by bed bugs, and electrophysiological studies support this. Single cell recordings have showed that botanical-derived repellents trigger action potentials from the D and E1 sensilla olfactory neurons located in antennal sensilla of bed bugs [

 <xref rid="B47-insects-12-00184" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The above results suggest that EOCs influence the bed bug’s nervous system inducing behavioral responses from bed bugs that reduce their exposure to EOC residues.
