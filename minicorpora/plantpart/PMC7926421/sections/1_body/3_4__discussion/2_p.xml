<p>We initially characterized the locomotor responses of individual bed bugs to EOCs using the tracking system Noldus EthoVision XT. The system tracked simultaneously and separately, the activity of individual bed bugs interacting with acetone, fresh or 24-h aged residues of EOCs during 10 min (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-12-00184-f001">Figure 1</xref>). The variables that yielded the most informative and consistent results about repellency toward EOCs were distance and number of visits to treated areas. Number of visits in 
 <xref rid="insects-12-00184-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> showed that bed bugs made contact with areas treated with fresh residues of all of the tested EOCs. However, bugs interacting with fresh residues of geraniol, eugenol, carvacrol, thymol, and trans-cinnamaldehyde tended to avoid both getting close to and visiting treated areas, while bugs in arenas with fresh residues of citronellic acid and linalool had a reduced visitation rate to treated areas. These avoidance responses could have been the result of bed bugs moving away from the treated area either because of irritancy (after contacting the treated area) or because repellency (after perceiving the EOCs at some distance). Plant EOCs have shown to cause contact toxicity against insect pests including cockroaches, kissing bugs, and bed bugs [

 <xref rid="B29-insects-12-00184" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In a previous study on bed bugs, carvacrol, thymol, citronellic acid, eugenol, and geraniol had the highest contact toxicity, with some of them inducing increased locomotor activity [

From the 11 EOCs tested in our study, seven components elicited avoidance responses from bed bugs, five of which were terpenoids (geraniol, carvacrol, thymol, citronellic acid, linalool), one was a phenylpropane (eugenol), and one was an aldehyde (trans-Cinnamaldehyde). Plant essential oils that contain high concentrations of effective constituents identified in this study are java citronella oil (geraniol, citronellic acid), clove oil (eugenol), and red thyme (carvacrol, thymol, linalool) [

 <xref rid="B27-insects-12-00184" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. It is very likely that essential oils containing effective EOCs have reduced repellency properties, or not have it at all, due to the presence of other EOCs that affect their bioactivity.
