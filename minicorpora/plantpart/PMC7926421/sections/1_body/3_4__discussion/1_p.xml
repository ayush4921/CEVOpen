<p>While essential oils and EOCs have demonstrated excellent contact and fumigant toxicity against bed bugs [

 <xref rid="B35-insects-12-00184" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], there is still limited information on the repellency of these compounds when applied to personal belongings or directly to skin to protect a host from bites. However, skin-applied repellent products can be sticky and therefore not suitable for use before going to bed. In addition, there are health concerns due to the prolonged and repeated exposure of the host to these compounds [
 <xref rid="B42-insects-12-00184" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The most practical option to deter bed bugs from biting a host could be to treat fabric or areas in the proximity of the bed with repellents. Similarly, passive transportation of bed bugs in furniture and personal belongings might also be prevented by treating these items with effective and long-lasting repellents. Therefore, characterization of behavioral responses of bed bugs to plant-derived compounds could lead to the identification of compounds that help reduce bed bug biting activity and the spread of bed bugs.
