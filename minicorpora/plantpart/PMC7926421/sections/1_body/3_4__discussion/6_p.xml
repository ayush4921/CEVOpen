<p>Contrasting behavioral responses from bed bugs were detected in evaluations with other EOCs. For example, while avoidance behavior to fresh residues of linalool was detected in individual tracking, choice tests did reveal that aged residues of this constituent induced arrestment behavior in bed bugs. Similarly, individual bed bugs visited more areas treated with aged residues of α-pinene when compared with fresh or acetone-treated areas. Although α-pinene is often included in insect baits [
