<p>The mechanisms by which EOCs cause toxicity in insects include interaction with various neurotransmitter receptors at the nervous system level, and the extent of the toxicity vary according to the structural and chemical properties of the components [
 <xref rid="B44-insects-12-00184" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The tendency of terpenoids to cause more toxicity and behavioral effects than other non-terpenoid constituents have been reported in other bed bugâ€™s studies [
