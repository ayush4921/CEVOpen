<p>Due to their high volatibility, nearly all plant-derived pesticides are considered excellent fumigants with limited residual activity [
 <xref rid="B18-insects-12-00184" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This assertion is not totally supported, however, by results from forced exposure bioassays that showed that residues of plant-essential oil-based products were still toxic to bed bugs after 14 d of aging [
 <xref rid="B27-insects-12-00184" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Residual efficacy of essential oils is not surprising according to recent laboratory evidence that reported that some EOCs have a low evaporation rate [

 <xref rid="B48-insects-12-00184" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. If residues of EOCs maintain their toxicity over time, they could potentially be used not only to kill foraging bed bugs, but also to prevent them from reaching a host, or hiding and establishing in personal belongings. As a proof-of-concept of lasting residual effect of EOCs, we evaluated behavioral responses from both, individual and groups of bed bugs to 24-h aged residues. We selected this length of residue aging as a theoretical time to provide transient protection of personal belongings, or a sleeping host, from bed bug activity. Our behavioral data from tracking and choice tests revealed that the 1% EOCs (geraniol, eugenol, citronellic acid, and carvacrol) are avoided by bed bugs even after their residues were aged for 24 h. Interestingly, three of these EOCs, geraniol, citronellic acid and eugenol, were reported previously as having low evaporation rates during a 24 h-period (1.29%, 5.16%, and 4.48%, respectively) [
 <xref rid="B29-insects-12-00184" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Avoidance response to carvacrol was expected as this component had a relative low evaporation rate (26.89%). A similar analogy can be drawn from evaluations with thymol, a highly volatile component (≥90% evaporation rate, [
 <xref rid="B29-insects-12-00184" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], whose aged residues were not avoided in choice tests. Short repellent residual activity of some EOCs is a limiting factor for their use in urban pest control and future research should evaluate microencapsulated techniques and EOC mixtures that prolong their life action. Additionally, since the EOCs tested in this study are active ingredients of essential oils that are “generally recognized as safe” (GRAS) (
