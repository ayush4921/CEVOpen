<p>Bed bugs in arenas with fresh or 24-h aged residues of geraniol (F = 24.86, df = 2, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), or eugenol (F = 48.68, df = 2, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) were significantly more distanced from EOC-treated areas than bed bugs in control arenas (
 <xref rid="insects-12-00184-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Similarly, bed bugs significantly avoided visiting areas impregnated with fresh or 24-h aged residues of geraniol (fresh residues: 
 <italic>U</italic> = 154.5, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0002; aged residues: 
 <italic>U</italic> = 147.5,

 <italic>U</italic> = 150.5, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0015), thymol (fresh residues: 
 <italic>U</italic> = 145.0, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0131; aged residues: 
 <italic>U</italic> = 147.5,

 <italic>p</italic> = 0.003; aged residues: 
 <italic>U</italic> = 150.5, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0014), when compared with control arenas (
 <xref rid="insects-12-00184-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Only fresh residues of carvacrol (
 <italic>T</italic> = 4.184, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0011), thymol (
 <italic>T</italic> = 4.836, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0013), and trans-Cinnamaldehyde (
 <italic>T</italic> = 3.708, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0075) kept bed bugs significantly more distanced than bed bugs in control arenas (
 <xref rid="insects-12-00184-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). While fresh residues of linalool were significantly less visited by bed bugs (
 <italic>U</italic> = 144.0, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0163), aged residues of Î±-pinene had the highest rate of visitation among all components tested (
 <italic>U</italic> = 135.0, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0445). Analysis of distance among treatments showed that bed bugs were more distanced from areas treated with thymol than other EOCs with both residues, fresh (F
 <sub>10,73</sub> = 8.19; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) and 24-h aged (F
 <sub>10,73</sub> = 3.31; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Number of visits of bed bugs to areas treated with fresh residues were significantly different among EOCs (H (10) = 31.93, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001)), with significant lower visitation rates to fresh residues of eugenol and citronellic acid (
 <xref rid="insects-12-00184-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Similarly, 24-h aged residues of geraniol, eugenol, thymol, and citronellic had significantly lower visitation rates than other EOCs ((H (10) = 39.80, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001)).
