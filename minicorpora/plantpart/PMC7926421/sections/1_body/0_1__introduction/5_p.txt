0: The objective of our study was to characterize behavioral responses of bed bugs to (EOCs) that are common active ingredients of essential oil products using a video-tracking system and supplemented with a laboratory choice test.
1: We also assessed whether bed bugs would crawl over areas treated with (EOCs) to reach a heat source and take a blood meal.
2: Our results show that essential oil formulations with geraniol, eugenol, carvacrol and citronellic acid have the potential to protect personal belongings from bed bugs, but the presence of heat, and other host associated-cues, might interfere with these responses.
