0: Integrated pest management (IPM) strategies have been proposed for long-term management of bed bug infestations [ 10].
1: This approach includes the combined use of chemical methods (liquid sprays, dusts, and fumigants), and non-chemical tools (vacuuming, heat, steam, washing and drying, low temperatures, exclusion with mattress encasements).
2: Challenges in reducing bed bug incidence and densities, particularly in multiunit housing communities, have prompted a community-wide bed bug management program consideration.
3: This program includes proactive detection of bed bugs and training for staff members and residents regarding biology, behavior and prevention of infestations [ 11, 12].
4: While many prevention methods have been proposed in these programs (e.g., monitors, mattress encasements, use of desiccant dusts, structural modification through sealing of cracks of crevices) [ 13], these tools are meant to prevent infestations from becoming established, and not for personal protection or reduce the passive transportation of bed bugs from one place to another.
5: The application of repellents could be an effective method to prevent bed bug bites, avoid hitchhikers while visiting infested places, or reduce the spread of infestations through personal items or furniture [ 14].
6: Information on the efficacy and use of repellents against bed bugs is limited.
7: N,N-Diethyl-3-methylbenzamide (DEET), the most widely used insect repellent, has been evaluated using in vivo [ 15] and in vitro systems [ 14, 16, 17] providing greater efficacy and extended residual activity.
8: However, there is a growing concern about the publics negative perception about the impact of DEET on human health [ 18].
9: Alternative compounds that have demonstrated repellent activity against bed bugs include 3-methyl-5-hexyl-2-cyclohexenone, propyl dihydrojasmonate, and -methyl tridecalactone [ 14].
