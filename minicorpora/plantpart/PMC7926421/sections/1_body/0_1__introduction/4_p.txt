0: Natural insecticides, especially plant essential oils, have been used extensively to interrupt host seeking of blood-feeding insects [ 17, 19, 20].
1: These compounds are attractive alternative tools to synthetic chemical repellents because they are considered to have low toxicity to humans, animals and the environment [ 18].
2: Because of their minimum risk, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have exempted some plant-derived compounds from full registration [Section 25(b) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act of United States] [ 21].
3: Reduced registration requirements by EPA has led to a flood of essential-oil based products available commercially for indoor use.
4: Many of these compounds have been evaluated in the laboratory for repellent activity against urban pests [ 22, 23, 24].
5: Essential oil constituents such as geraniol and citronellol had repellent activity on  Triatoma rubida (Uhler) , T. protacta (Uhler) , and  T. recurva (Stal) (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) [ 25], while carvacrol, eugenol, and geraniol repelled  Rhodnius prolixus (Stal) and  T. infestans (Klug) (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) [ 26].
6: Thymol was reported as having repellent activity against  Blatella lateralis (Walker) (Blattodea: Blattidae) [ 24].
7: In bed bugs, several studies have evaluated the contact toxicity [ 27, 28, 29, 30, 31], fumigant toxicity [ 29, 32, 33], and residual toxicity [ 34, 35] of plant-derived pesticides, but few have studied in detailed their repellency.
8: Anderson et al.
9: [ 36] demonstrated the efficacy of three naturally occurring repellents, para-menthane-3,8-diol, delta dodecalactone, and gamma dodecalactone to prevent bed bugs from hiding in substrate-treated areas.
10: Catnip oils also exhibited high repellency activity against bed bugs, but their residual effect was shorter than DEET [ 37].
11: Sharififard et al.
12: [ 38] conducted laboratory evaluations with essential oils of oregano  Origanum vulgare and demonstrated 100% repellency against bed bugs up to 24 h. In choice tests, bed bugs seemed to avoid contacting areas treated with lethal doses of two essential oil-based products, EcoRaider  and Bed Bug Patrol  [ 27].
13: The latter three studies did not characterize the repellency or avoidance induced by major constituents of the essential oils in bed bugs.
14: There is also an anecdotal report of the lack of repellency activity of cedar and peppermint oil against bed bugs [ 14], which might be explained by the absence of essential oil constituents (EOCs) with repellent properties in the composition of these essential oils.
15: Identification of EOCs with repellent activity will help develop potentially efficacious essential oil-based formulations.
16: Recently, medium-chain length fatty acids from coconut oil exhibited strong and lasting repellent activity against various blood-sucking arthropods, including bed bugs [ 17].
17: The easing of the US government requirements for plant product registration, the relative low production cost of many of these materials, and the perception by consumers as green, make these products likely to be adopted and incorporated into IPM programs for bed bugs.
