<p>This experiment was conducted in a glass cylinder (height: 22 cm, diameter: 8 cm, Hobby Lobby, Oklahoma City, OK, USA) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-12-00184-f002">Figure 2</xref>); the open end of each container was covered with a screened lid (500 µm plankton netting, Bioquip Products, Rancho Dominguez, CA, USA). This fabric top made contact with a parafilm-membrane feeder previously described. Insects reached the heated surface by crawling up a square wood post (2.5 cm each side, 21 cm height). A paper strip (10 cm wide by 5 cm height, Whatman no. 2) was impregnated with an EOC-acetone solution (600 µL of 1%, geraniol, eugenol, citronellic acid, carvacrol, or acetone), wrapped around the stick, 5 cm away from the base, and attached with staples. To reach the blood source (37 °C), the bed bugs needed to cross the EOC-treated band. Twenty insects (1:1 sex ratio, females and males were morphologically differentiated according to Usinger [
 <xref rid="B1-insects-12-00184" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]; 3 replicates) were restricted in a shell vial (21 mm diameter × 70 mm height) and acclimatized for one hour in the bottom of the cylinder, before turning on the water circulator system that warmed the blood held in the glass feeder. The bugs were released under the similar conditions used in choice tests. The number of fed and unfed insects after 12 h was recorded for each treatment and analyzed with a chi-square goodness-of-fit-test [
