<p>A near-infrared (NIR) camera (series acA1300-60 gm NIR camera, Basler
 <sup>®</sup> ace; Exton, PA, USA) outfitted with a lens (C-mount 4–8 mm varifocal megapixel CCTV lens, model# H2Z0414C-MP, Computar
 <sup>®</sup>; Torrance, CA, USA) and (infrared) IR filter (Infrared 850 light filter, Heliopan
 <sup>®</sup>, North White Plains, NY, USA) was used to record bed bug activity in the arenas under dark conditions. The camera was positioned approximately 58 cm directly above the center arena. Light for the recordings was provided by two IR illuminators (AT-8SB 850 mm, 130_, AXTON
 <sup>®</sup>, North Salt Lake, UT, USA). EthoVision XT version 11.5 software (Noldus Information Technology Inc. Leesburg, VA, USA, [
 <xref rid="B40-insects-12-00184" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] was used to capture video images and to track the bed bugs during 10-min bioassays. EthoVision XT virtually facilitates the marking of each treated circle. The software transformed bed bug tracking activity into several variables, but only two variables were used to characterize behavioral responses: “distance” (cm) to treated area” and “number of visits” to the treated area. The same variables were calculated from the activity of bed bugs recorded in control arenas (acetone treated). Comparisons of “distance” were made with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Dunnett’s test for mean separation within treatments (control vs. fresh residues, or control 24-h aged residues), or Tukey’s pairwise test for mean separation among treatments. Data from “number of visits” failed the normality test (Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, &lt;0.05) and comparisons within and among treatments were made with the nonparametric Mann–Whitney test and a Bonferroni-adjusted α level of 0.0167.
