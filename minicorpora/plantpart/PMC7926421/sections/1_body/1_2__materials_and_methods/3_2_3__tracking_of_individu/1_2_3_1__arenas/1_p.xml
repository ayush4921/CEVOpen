<p>Tracking of individual bed bugs was conducted using the bottoms of plastic petri dishes (9 cm) with a small hole (1 cm) cut into the plastic (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-12-00184-f001">Figure 1</xref>). These dishes were flipped on a square glass (23 cm × 23 cm) whose floor was covered with white filter paper (Whatman no. 2) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-12-00184-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Each petri dish enclosed a 3-cm diameter filter paper placed in the center and impregnated with 100 µL of each solution at 1%, or acetone only. These circles were previously allowed to dry for 1 h (fresh residues) or aged for 24 h in a fume hood. Each tracking included arenas treated with acetone, the fresh compound, or aged for 24 h (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-12-00184-f001">Figure 1</xref>, left). Insects were released by lifting up the shell vial. Recordings were conducted under ambient temperature (25 ± 2 °C) and relative humidity (40 ± 10%) for 10 min within the first three hours of the scotophase, a time in which bed bugs display enhanced locomotor activity [
