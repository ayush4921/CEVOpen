<p>Six EOCs, geraniol, eugenol, citronellic acid, thymol, carvacrol, and linalool were further evaluated with a choice test to assess avoidance responses from bed bugs during a 14 h-period. The selection of these EOCs was based on the lower visitation rates by bed bugs to 24-h aged residues detected in the tracking experiment (
 <xref rid="insects-12-00184-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Insects were offered two tents made of filter paper (15 × 12 mm, Whatman no. 2) folded in the middle to offer a tent-like shelter of 15 mm length by 5 mm height with two open ends. Group responses were carried out in flat-bottomed Pyrex bowls (12.4 cm diameter by 6.0 cm height; Corning, Corning, NY, USA) whose surfaces were covered with a white filter paper (110 mm diameter; Whatman no. 2), fixed to the glass with double-sided tape. After each assay, papers were removed and bowls were rinsed with acetone. During the photophase, arenas were illuminated with 40-W fluorescent tubes placed 60 cm above the arena surfaces, which provide a light intensity of ~660 lux. Under these conditions, bed bugs would seek harborages during the day. Groups of ten bed bugs (1:1 sex ratio) were offered tents that had been treated with 50 µL of 1% solution of geraniol, eugenol, citronellic acid, thymol, carvacrol, or linalool. 1% DEET was used as a positive control while acetone as negative control. Treated tents were aged 24 h before use. Six replicates were performed for each compound. All assays lasted 14 h (from 18:00 to 08:00 h the next day) with the following light–dark regimen: lights off at 18:00 h and lights on at 06:00 h (the same light cycle used during rearing). Room temperature remained at 24 ± 2 °C. Insects were acclimated to the environment for 15 min by restricting them in a shell vial (21 mm diameter × 70 mm height) which was placed inverted in the center of the arena. Insects were released by lifting up the shell vial within the first hour of the scotophase. At the end of the test, the location of insects resting on a tent or wandering in the arena was recorded. The number of responses was analyzed by a binomial test with exact two-tailed
