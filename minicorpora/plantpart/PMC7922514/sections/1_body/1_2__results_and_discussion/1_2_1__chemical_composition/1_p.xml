<p>The steam distillation of the trunk bark of 
 <italic>T. articulata</italic> yielded 0.05% (

 <italic>w</italic>) of a pale-yellow colored oil. The full chemical profiles were determined by Gas Chromatography coupled to Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) and are presented in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-01110-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Overall, 54 compounds were identified, representing from 90.8% up to 96.0% of the total compositions. Terpenes (in the form of both mono- and sesquiterpenes) were detected as the main chemical group of compounds, with relative concentrations ranging from 88.2% to 95.8%. Oxygenated sesquiterpenes were the most abundant chemical class of compounds in all samples. Among them, caryophyllene oxide (
 <bold>40</bold>) was detected as the major constituent in all samples, ranging from a minimum of 13.1% in HEE, up to 26.6% in E.2, carotol (
 <bold>45</bold>) and 14-hydroxy-9-
 <italic>epi</italic>-(
 <italic>E</italic>)-caryophyllene (
 <bold>52</bold>) followed, with relative percentages varying from a minimum of 9.2% in HEE to a maximum of 21.2% in E.4, and between 2.7% in E.1 and 15.5% in E.5. Oxygenated monoterpenes were the second most abundant chemical class in HEE and E.1; α-terpineol (0.3–10.4%; 
 <bold>12</bold>), borneol (0.3–4.1%; 
 <bold>9</bold>), and geranyl 2-methylbutyrate (0.2–4.9%; 
 <bold>41</bold>) were the most represented. In all other samples, sesquiterpene hydrocarbons followed as the second most abundant chemical group, among which α-muurolene (
 <bold>30</bold>, from 5.5% in HEE, up to 12.5% in E.5) and β-caryophyllene (
 <bold>24</bold>, not detected in E.5, up to 5.5% in HEE) showed the highest relative presence. Caryophyllene oxide, β-caryophyllene and carotol (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-01110-f001">Figure 1</xref>) have all been described as potent medicinal compounds with various activities, such as analgesic [

 <xref rid="B27-molecules-26-01110" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the itemized chemical characterization of the trunk bark essential oil of 
 <italic>T. articulata</italic>. In spite of the many investigations into the chemical composition of essential oils from the different organs of the same species, the trunk bark essential oil of 
 <italic>T. articulata</italic> presented a totally distinct chemical profile. In Tunisia, Tekaya-Karoui et al. [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-26-01110" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-26-01110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] demonstrated that the main components in the nonwoody branches oil was 
 <italic>Z</italic>-muurolene (29.0%) and 4,6-dimethyl-octane-3,5-dione (22.4%). In the cone oil, the most important compounds found were 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene-8-ol (10.4%) and β-phellandrene (8.1%). The major constituent in the oils of the roots and the woody branches was found to be camphene (70.2 and 43.2%, respectively). Nonan-1-ol was the main constituent present in the fraction of the essential oil from woody terminal branches (75.2%).In the fraction of the essential oil from roots, the major compound detected was bornyl acetate (16.6%).The results reported by Barrero et al. [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-26-01110" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], from Morocco, have shown that the leaf essential oil was rich in bornyl acetate (16.5%), camphor (19.1%) and borneol (9.6%), and that the essential oil from the wood was rich in cedrol (28.2%) and 1,7-di-
 <italic>epi</italic>-cedrol (17.9%).
