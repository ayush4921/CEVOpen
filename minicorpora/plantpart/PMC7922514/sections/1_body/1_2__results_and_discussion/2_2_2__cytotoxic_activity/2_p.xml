<p>The cytotoxic activity of the essential oil of 
 <italic>T. articulata</italic> trunk bark and its fractions may be attributed to specific components of the oils. In previous works [

 <xref rid="B33-molecules-26-01110" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], it has been shown that caryophyllene oxide (HEE: 13.1%, E.1: 25.2%, E.2: 26.6%, E.3: 20.5%, E.4: 20.2% and E.5: 21.9%;

 <xref rid="molecules-26-01110-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), which are predominant in the essential oil and its fractions, could be responsible for the cytotoxic activity. It has been reported that caryophyllene oxide inhibited cell growth, in a dose-dependent and cell-specific manner, against different types of cell lines, e.g., HepG2, AGS, HeLa, SNU-1 and SNU-16 cells, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranging from 3.9 to 27.4 ÂµM [

 <italic>Myrica gale</italic> L. essential oil [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-26-01110" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In addition, minor components could also contribute to cytotoxic activity of the oils, acting in synergy with the other quantitatively predominant compounds [
