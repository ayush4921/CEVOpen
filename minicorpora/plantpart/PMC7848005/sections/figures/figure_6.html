 <caption> The expression levels of enzymes involved in FA synthesis and TAG assembly in developing A. trifoliata seeds. Gene expression levels in May, June, July, August, and September are indicated with colored bars (log2 FPKM). ACCase acetyl-CoA carboxylase, CPT diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase, DGAT acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase, EAR enoyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) reductase, FAD2 oleate desaturase, FAD3 linoleate desaturase, FATA/B acyl-ACP thioesterase A/B, GK glycerol kinase, GPAT glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, HAD hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydrase, KAR ketoacyl-ACP reductase, KASI ketoacyl-ACP synthase I, KAS II ketoacyl-ACP synthase II, KAS III ketoacyl-ACP synthase III, KCS 3-ketoacyl-CoA synthase, LACS long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase, LPAAT 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, PAP phosphatidate phosphatase, LPCAT 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphocholine acyltransferase, MAT malonyl-CoA:ACP malonyltransferase, PDAT phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase, SAD stearoyl-ACP desaturase. The colored boxes represent log 2 FPKM values of DEGs in developing seeds, and sample names are shown on the lower right-hand side </caption>
