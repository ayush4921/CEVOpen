 <caption> Comparative genomics analysis of A. trifoliata subsp. australis and other representative plant species. A Classification and statistics of common and lineage-specific genes in A. trifoliata and other representative plant species. B Venn diagram of gene families in A. trifoliata and three other basal eudicot species. C Phylogenetic analysis, gene family expansion/contraction analyses and divergence time estimations. The number of gene family contraction and expansion events are indicated by blue (the blue part of the pie chart) and red (the red part of the pie chart) numbers, respectively. Divergence times (million years ago, Mya) are indicated by the numbers beside the branch nodes. D Distribution of 4DTv among A. trifoliata, N. nucifera, and V. vinifera in intra- and intergenomic comparisons </caption>
