 <caption> LTR insertion time estimation, enrichment analysis of expanded and contracted genes, and phylogenetic analysis of β-amyrin synthase genes. A LTR insertion time analysis in A. trifoliata and other representative plant species. B, C KEGG enrichment analysis of expanded and contracted genes in A. trifoliata. Red indicates pathways related to triterpenoid biosynthesis and fatty-acid metabolism. D Phylogenetic analysis of β-amyrin synthase genes in A. trifoliata (red), rice, Arabidopsis and grape. The protein sequences of β-amyrin synthase in Arabidopsis, rice and grape were downloaded from the UniProt database. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using the ML method with 1000 bootstrap replicates </caption>
