<p id="Par5">In addition to the usages mentioned above, the cultivated fruit of 
 <italic>A. trifoliata</italic> is consumed as a delicacy due to its delicious taste and abundance of nutrients. 
 <italic>Akebia trifoliata</italic> belongs to the genus 
 <italic>Akebia</italic> (Lardizabalaceae) and, like 
 <italic>Aquilegia coerulea</italic> and 
 <italic>Papaver somniferum</italic>, is a member of the basal eudicots, which possess more diverse floral morphologies than the core eudicots and monocots. The identification and investigation of floral genes in basal eudicots can be used as an evolutionary link between core eudicots and grasses
