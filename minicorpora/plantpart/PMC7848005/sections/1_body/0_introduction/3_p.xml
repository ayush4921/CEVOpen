<p id="Par4">As a potential oilseed medicinal plant, 
 <italic>A. trifoliata</italic> seeds contain up to 39% oil with 77% unsaturated fatty acids
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>
 </sup>. Owing to the high UFA content, the seed oil of 
 <italic>A. trifoliata</italic> is used as a quality edible oil and dietary supplement in China. In contrast to saturated fatty acids (SFAs), the dietary potency of UFAs has health benefits by reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease, obesity, and cancer
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>
 </sup> and promoting the absorption of lipophilic nutritional compounds
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>
 </sup>. Fatty acids (FAs) are synthesized in plastids from acetyl-CoA up to 18:1
 <sup>Δ9</sup>, the first desaturation catalyzed by stearoyl-acyl-carrier protein desaturase (SAD). After export to the cytosol, FAs can be elongated and desaturated to produce long-chain and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) by various enzymes within the ER and eventually processed into the storage lipid triacylglycerol (TAG)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>
 </sup>. TAG is stored in oil bodies that serve as a natural protective system against fatty-acid oxidation and maintain lipid stability
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>
 </sup>. In olive oil, monounsaturated oleic acid (C18:1) makes up 75% of all TAGs, followed by saturated palmitic acid (C16:0; ~13.5%), polyunsaturated linoleic acid (C18:2; ~5.5%), and α-linolenic acid (C18:3; ~0.75%)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>
 </sup>. In sesame seed oil, both oleic acid and linoleic acid are more evenly present (~40%)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>
 </sup>. The differential accumulation of oleic and linoleic acids in olive compared with sesame is attributed to the functional divergence of oil biosynthesis pathway genes, such as ω-6 
 <italic>fatty-acid desaturase 2</italic> (
 <italic>FAD2</italic>) and 
 <italic>SAD</italic>, following duplication
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>
 </sup>. Oleosin, the most abundant oil body-associated protein, is a major determinant of oil body size
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>
 </sup> and has been suggested to contribute to the stability of oil bodies and their synthesis and metabolism
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>
 </sup>. The heterologous expression of castor bean oleosin in 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> led to a 20% increase in the ricinoleic acid content in TAGs
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>
 </sup>. Moreover, coexpression of oleosins with other TAG biosynthesis genes increased the oil content
