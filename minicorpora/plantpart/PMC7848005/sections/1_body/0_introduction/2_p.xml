<p id="Par3">Studies have indicated that the upstream reactions of triterpenoid biosynthesis through the mevalonate (MVA) or methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathways are involved in making building blocks and intermediates such as isopentenylpyrophosphate and farnesyl diphosphate (FPP)

 </sup>. The downstream reactions of triterpenoid biosynthesis start from the condensation of two molecules of FPP, and the triterpenoid backbone undergoes oxidation, substitution, and glycosylation to generate various triterpenoids, involving many key enzymes, including squalene synthase (SQS), squalene monoxidase, oxidosqualene cyclase (OSC), cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (CYP), and uridine diphosphate glycosyltransferase (UGT)

 <italic>β</italic>-amyrin synthase (
 <italic>β</italic>-AS), a kind of OSC, is a unique key enzyme that catalyzes oleanane-type triterpenoid biosynthesis, and its expression is positively correlated with oleanane-type saponin content
