0: Despite the considerable importance of  A. trifoliata, genomic information for the species is limited, which has hindered its study and utilization.
1: Here, we report the sequencing and assembly of a high-quality chromosomal-level genome sequence of  A. trifoliata subsp.
2: australis, which is the first sequenced species in the genus  Akebia.
3: Furthermore, we identified key genes involved in triterpene synthesis and the accumulation of UFAs.
4: The availability of this genomic information will be helpful for comparative genomic analysis and the molecular breeding and engineering of  A. trifoliata.
