<p id="Par6">Despite the considerable importance of 
 <italic>A. trifoliata</italic>, genomic information for the species is limited, which has hindered its study and utilization. Here, we report the sequencing and assembly of a high-quality chromosomal-level genome sequence of 
 <italic>A. trifoliata</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>australis</italic>, which is the first sequenced species in the genus 
 <italic>Akebia</italic>. Furthermore, we identified key genes involved in triterpene synthesis and the accumulation of UFAs. The availability of this genomic information will be helpful for comparative genomic analysis and the molecular breeding and engineering of 
 <italic>A. trifoliata</italic>.
