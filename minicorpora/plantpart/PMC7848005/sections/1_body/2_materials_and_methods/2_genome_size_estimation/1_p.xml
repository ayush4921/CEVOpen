 <italic>A. trifoliata</italic> according to the method described by Huang et al.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>
 </sup>. First, young fresh leaves of 
 <italic>A. trifoliata</italic> were chopped in nuclear isolation buffer. The supernatant was filtered through a 50-Î¼m CellTrics filter. After being treated with RNase, cell nuclei were stained with propidium iodide in the dark. The fluorescence intensity of the sample was determined using a flow cytometer (BD FACSVerse). Maize B73 was used as an internal standard. The genome size of 
 <italic>A. trifoliata</italic> was evaluated by k-mer frequency analysis using Illumina short reads. After removing contaminants, the optimal k-mer size was analyzed using KmerGenie
