<p id="Par25">For the evaluation of assembly coverage, all paired-end short reads were mapped to our assembly using BWA

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>
 </sup>. RNA-Seq data from leaf, root, and stem tissues were assembled by Trinity

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>
 </sup> to evaluate gene completeness. The completeness of the assembly was assessed by the CEG mapping approach (v2.5) (CEGMA)

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>
