 </sup>. Fifty milligrams of seed powder (fresh weight) was treated using chloroform-methanol solution (V/V = 2:1). Ultrasonic technology was used for FA extraction. Fatty acyl methyl esters (FAMEs) were prepared by direct transesterification of FA with 1% sulfuric acid in methanol at 80 °C for 30 min. The FAMEs were extracted with 1 mL hexane and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) with methyl heptadecanoate as an internal standard. GC-MS analysis was performed on an Agilent 6890 N/5975B (Agilent, USA) equipped with an Agilent HP-INNOWAX column (30 m × 0.25 mm ID × 0.25 µm). The column temperature was raised from 150 °C to 230 °C at a rate of 10 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup> and then increased to 250 °C and maintained for 10 min. Peaks were identified by comparing the retention times with those of the corresponding standards (Sigma), and their identities were also confirmed by comparing mass spectra to the National Institute of Standards and Technology mass spectral library. The concentration of each sample was normalized according to the internal control.
