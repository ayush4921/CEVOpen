<p id="Par28">Multiple gene prediction methods integrating homolog-, de novo-, and transcriptome-based gene prediction were used to annotate protein-coding genes. For homologous prediction, a gene set including proteins from four plant genomes (
 <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana, A. coerulea, Opium poppy</italic>, and 
 <italic>M. cordata</italic>) was mapped to the assembly of the 
 <italic>A. trifoliata</italic> genome by BLAST
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>
 </sup>, and then GeneWise software was used to provide an accurate gene structure prediction
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>
 </sup>. RNA-Seq reads were first aligned to our genome assembly using HISAT2
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>
 </sup>, and then StringTie
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>
 </sup> was used to assemble the alignments into gene models in a transcriptome-based prediction. 
 <italic>De novo</italic> identification was performed using Augustus (v2.5.5)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>
 </sup>, GENSCAN (v1.0)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>
 </sup>, SNAP
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>
 </sup>, and GlimmerHMM (v3.0.1)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>
 </sup>. All the resulting genes mentioned above were integrated using EVidenceModeler
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>
 </sup>.
