 <italic>amyrin synthase-like, TPS</italic>, and 
 <italic>FAD</italic> genes, the predicted genes were aligned using MUSCLE. Hence, two ML (maximum-likelihood) phylogenetic trees were constructed using RAxML software. The bootstrap test was performed with 1000 replicates to obtain high reliability of interior branches. The phylogenetic tree was imported to iTOL (
