 <italic>A. trifoliata</italic> seeds were collected at 20, 50, 80, 110, and 140 days after flowering in May, June, July, August, and September, respectively. Library construction and RNA-Seq were performed as mentioned above. Clean reads were mapped to the reference genomes by HISAT2

 </sup>. The expression level (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million fragments mapped, FPKM value) of unigenes was calculated by StringTie

 </sup> (adjusted 
 <italic>P</italic> value, FDR &lt; 0.05). To clarify the biological functions of the DEGs, KEGG enrichment analysis was performed (
