 <italic>A. trifoliata</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>australis</italic> leaves were collected from Huaihua, Hunan Province, China (N27°33’17.95”, E109°59’54.70”). A modified cetyl trimethylammonium bromide method

 </sup> was used for DNA extraction. The DNA was used to construct a 20 kb insert-sized SMRTbell library for PacBio sequencing and 350 bp insert-size paired-end libraries for Illumina short-read sequencing. These libraries were prepared according to the manufacturer’s protocol (PacBio, CA, USA and Illumina, CA, USA). For RNA-seq, total RNA was extracted from the leaves, roots, and stems of 
 <italic>A. trifoliata</italic>, and a mixture was made by combining an equal amount from each. After removing genomic DNA using DNase I (Takara), mRNAs were obtained using oligo (dT) beads and broken into short fragments, followed by cDNA synthesis. Paired-end sequencing was conducted on the HiSeq X Ten platform (Illumina, CA, USA). All PacBio and Illumina sequencing procedures were performed by the BioMarker Technologies Company (Beijing, China).
