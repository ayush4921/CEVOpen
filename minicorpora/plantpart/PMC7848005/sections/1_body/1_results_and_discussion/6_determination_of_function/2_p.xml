<p id="Par16">In the 
 <italic>A. trifoliata</italic> genome, 12 UDP-glucoronosyl and 3 UDP-glucosyltransferase gene families were expanded and contracted, respectively, while 7 and 14 cytochrome P450 gene families were expanded and contracted, respectively. The downstream reactions in the biosynthesis of saponins are believed to include a set of cytochrome P450-dependent hydroxylation/oxidations and several glycosyl transfer reactions catalyzed by glycosyltransferases

 </sup>. The frequent expansion and contraction of the two gene families indicate a rapid evolution of these gene families, which might be the cause of the great variety of triterpenes in 
 <italic>A. trifoliata</italic>. Unexpectedly, terpene synthase (TPS) gene families (PF01397, PF03936), which are responsible for the synthesis of various terpene molecules, were contracted in the 
 <italic>A. trifoliata</italic> genome (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S7</xref>). We performed genome-wide identification of the TPS gene family and identified 34 
 <italic>AtrTPS</italic> genes (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S9</xref>), which is much fewer than that of 
 <italic>V. vinifera</italic> with 95 
 <italic>TPS</italic> genes. Moreover, the 
 <italic>TPS</italic> genes of 
 <italic>A. trifoliata</italic> and the other three species were used to construct a phylogenetic tree (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S7</xref>), and they grouped into four distinct clusters. All 
 <italic>AtrTPS</italic> genes were distributed in different branches of Cluster I, while Clusters II, III and IV comprised 
 <italic>TPS</italic> genes of rice, 
 <italic>V. vinifera</italic> and 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, respectively. These results suggest that there is functional diversification among the 
 <italic>TPS</italic> genes in those species and the 
 <italic>AtrTPS</italic> genes in 
 <italic>A. trifoliata</italic>. Evolutionary plasticity is evident in the TPS family, represented by different product profiles, subcellular locations, activities, and substrates.
