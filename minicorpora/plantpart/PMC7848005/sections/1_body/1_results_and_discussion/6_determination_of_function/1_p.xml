<p id="Par15">KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that the sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis pathways and monoterpenoid biosynthesis pathway were significantly enriched in expanded genes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3B, C</xref>). Notably, the 24 
 <italic>β-amyrin synthase-like</italic> (
 <italic>Atrβ-AS</italic>) genes involved in the sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis pathways catalyzing the conversion of oxidosqualene to 
 <italic>β</italic>-amyrin, the proposed aglycone of oleanane-type saponins
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>
 </sup>, were exclusively identified in the expanded gene set (Tables 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S7</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>). Suppression of 
 <italic>β-AS</italic> expression by RNA interference led to a reduced content of 
 <italic>β</italic>-amyrin and oleanane-type saponins
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>
 </sup>. The systematic identification, prediction, and evolutionary analysis of 
 <italic>Atrβ-ASs</italic> in 
 <italic>A. trifoliata</italic> have been of great significance to our understanding of the synthesis and regulation of triterpene saponins. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 24 
 <italic>Atrβ-</italic>
 <italic>AS</italic> genes were classified into two clusters, which formed two monophyletic groups. One 
 <italic>Atrβ-</italic>
 <italic>AS</italic> gene (EMV0021809) was grouped together with three 
 <italic>Vitβ-AS</italic> genes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>). The expansion of 
 <italic>Atrβ-AS</italic> genes might be an explanation for the high content of hederasaponin and oleanolic acid in many tissues of 
 <italic>A. trifoliata</italic>.
