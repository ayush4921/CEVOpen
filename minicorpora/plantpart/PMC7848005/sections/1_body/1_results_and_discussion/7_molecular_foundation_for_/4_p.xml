<p id="Par20">A total of 25 FADs (acyl-lipid desaturase and acyl-ACP desaturase) in 
 <italic>A. trifoliata</italic> were identified (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S11</xref>). To evaluate their evolutionary relationships and predict their gene functions, all the 
 <italic>FAD</italic> genes from 
 <italic>A. trifoliata</italic>, 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, rice, 
 <italic>Brassica napus</italic>, 
 <italic>S. indicum</italic>, and 
 <italic>O. europaea</italic> were aligned to construct an unrooted ML phylogenetic tree (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). All 
 <italic>AtrSADs</italic>, except for 
 <italic>Atr0019590</italic>, formed a well-defined monophyletic group, suggesting that 
 <italic>SAD</italic> extension occurred after the divergence of 
 <italic>A. trifoliata</italic> and other species. Notably, all identified 
 <italic>AtrFAD2</italic> and 
 <italic>AtrFAD6</italic> genes, as well as one 
 <italic>AtrSAD</italic> (
 <italic>Atr0019590</italic>) gene, clustered with the homologs of 
 <italic>S. indicum</italic> and 
 <italic>O. europaea</italic>, which suggests that these genes perform similar functions in the three species. The expansion and neofunctionalization of 
 <italic>SADs</italic> in oleasters are likely also responsible for the higher oleic acid contents in 
 <italic>A. trifoliata</italic> than in sesame
