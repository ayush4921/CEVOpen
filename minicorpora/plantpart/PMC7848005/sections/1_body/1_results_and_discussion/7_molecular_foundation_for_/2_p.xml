<p id="Par18">Transcriptomic analysis revealed that the gene expression profiles of seeds in July and August were closer to each other and obviously differed from those of the three other stages (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>). A total of 2420, 1331, 2170, and 3118 upregulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 5877, 3929, 1144, and 3871 downregulated DEGs were identified compared with those of the previous month (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>). There were more DEGs between May vs June and August vs September, which agrees with the principal component analysis results, demonstrating more marked changes in gene expression profiles at the early and later stages of seed development. KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that many DEGs were enriched in lipid metabolism pathways (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S10</xref>). An expression heat map of these DEGs linked to FA metabolism, integrating the changes in FA contents during the development of 
 <italic>A. trifoliata</italic> seeds, can provide valuable information about the regulation of oil accumulation and UFA synthesis. The reconstruction of the FA and TAG biosynthetic pathways includes 
 <italic>de novo</italic> formation of acyl chains in the plastid and TAG assembly in the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Almost all DEGs involved in the 
 <italic>biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) of acetyl-CoA carboxylase</italic> (
 <italic>ACCase</italic>) and 
 <italic>fatty-acid synthase</italic> (
 <italic>FAS</italic>) complexes including 
 <italic>β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase</italic> (
 <italic>KAS</italic>), 
 <italic>β-hydroxacyl-ACP dehydratase</italic> (
 <italic>HAD</italic>), and 
 <italic>enoyl-ACP reductase</italic> (
 <italic>EAR</italic>), showed maximal transcription in June, followed by July. The transcription peak of the core FA biosynthetic machinery coincided with the onset of oil accumulation in the seed at the early developmental stage. 
 <italic>ACCase</italic> catalyzes the conversion of acetyl-CoA into malonyl-CoA and is the rate-limiting enzyme in fatty-acid biosynthesis

 <italic>ACCase</italic>
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>

 <italic>KASI</italic> catalyzes the elongation of 
 <italic>de novo</italic> fatty acids, and 
 <italic>KASI</italic> mutation results in a significant reduction in FA contents in seeds
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>
 </sup>. 
 <italic>EAR</italic> catalyzes a key regulatory step in FA biosynthesis and shows the highest expression during the early stages of seed development
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>
 </sup>. In the oil palm mesocarp, the key FA biosynthesis genes were highly expressed at 120 days after pollination when oil accumulation began in the mesocarp

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>
 </sup>. We inferred that the significant upregulation of 
 <italic>ACCase</italic> and 
 <italic>FAS</italic> in seeds in June has a close relationship with the rapid increase in the oil content in July. Additionally, three 
 <italic>acyl-ACP thioesterases</italic> (
 <italic>FATA/B)</italic> and three 
 <italic>long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases</italic> (
 <italic>LACS)</italic> were also highly expressed in June. 
 <italic>FATA</italic> and 
 <italic>FATB</italic> play an essential role in chain termination during fatty-acid synthesis. LACS mediates FA transport and conversion to acyl-CoA

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>
 </sup>. However, many DEGs involved in triacylglycerol (TAG) biosynthesis, such as 
 <italic>glycerol kinase</italic> (
 <italic>GK</italic>), 
 <italic>glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase</italic> (
 <italic>GPAT</italic>), 
 <italic>1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase</italic> (
 <italic>LPAAT</italic>), 
 <italic>phosphatidate phosphatase</italic> (
 <italic>PAP</italic>), 
 <italic>acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase</italic> (
 <italic>DGAT</italic>), and 
 <italic>phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase</italic> (
 <italic>PDAT</italic>), were highly expressed throughout seed development.
