 </sup>. To further study FAs metabolism in 
 <italic>A. trifoliata</italic> seeds, we determined the FAs composition and gene expression profiles at different stages of seed development (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>). The total FA content increased 15-fold from May (17.8 mg g
 <sup>−1</sup>) to September (260.9 mg g
 <sup>−1</sup>), and FA accumulated dramatically from June (30.4 mg g
 <sup>−1</sup>) to July (158.3 mg g
 <sup>−1</sup>) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>). The time courses for the levels of the individual FAs were similar to that of the total FA content (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>). A sharp rise (six- to sevenfold) in the contents of oleic acid, linoleic acid, and palmitic acid was also observed from June to July. The linolenic acid levels remained stable at ~2 mg g
 <sup>−1</sup> during seed development. In May, linoleic acid (32%), palmitic acid (23%), and stearic acid (23%) were the dominant FAs in seeds, whereas oleic acid (3.8%) was much less abundant. With increasing seed maturity, we observed a significant increase in the proportion of oleic acid (34%) and linoleic acid (37%) and a reduced proportion of palmitic acid (19%), stearic acid (7%), and linolenic acid (0.95%) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>). In summary, the FA contents increased with seed development, and UFAs, including linoleic acid and oleic acid, accumulated especially rapidly during the early stages of seed development.
