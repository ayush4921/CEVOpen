<p id="Par19">Comparative genomics and enrichment analyses indicated that linoleic acid metabolism, Î±-linolenic acid metabolism, UFA, and FA biosynthesis were enriched in an expanded gene set (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). The expansion of those genes involved in lipid metabolism may be responsible for the high UFA and oil contents in 
 <italic>A. trifoliata</italic> seeds. Among those expanded gene families, an acyl-ACP desaturase gene family (PF03405.9), including 12 
 <italic>AtrSAD</italic> genes involved in UFA biosynthesis, was expanded in the 
 <italic>A. trifoliata</italic> genome. Furthermore, two 
 <italic>AtrSADs</italic> (EVM0019545 and EVM0019590) were highly expressed during seed development and showed significantly increased expression levels in seeds in July (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>), which may contribute to the high oleic acid content in 
 <italic>A. trifoliata</italic> seeds. Three omega 
 <italic>FAD</italic> genes, 
 <italic>FAD2</italic> (EVM0006409), 
 <italic>FAD6</italic> (EVM0001669), and 
 <italic>FAD7</italic> (EVM0000977), also remained at a high expression level during seed development (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7A, B</xref>), especially 
 <italic>FAD2. SAD</italic> and 
 <italic>FAD2</italic> play key roles in the synthesis of UFAs

 </sup>. The suppression of 
 <italic>FAD2</italic> expression by siRNA leads to a low linoleic acid content (5.5%) in olive oil

 </sup>. It is noteworthy that homologs of oleosin (EVM0009451, EVM0021590, EVM0024046, EVM0018287, and EVM0012715), encoding oil body proteins that assist with packaging of TAG and determining oil body size, showed a sharp increase and a significantly higher expression in seeds from June to September compared with that in May (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7A, C</xref>). For example, the FPKM values of the two 
 <italic>AtrOLEs</italic> (EVM0021590 and EVM0018287) in seeds were 441- and 366-fold higher in June than in May, respectively, which was confirmed by qRT-PCR (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7C</xref>). The results indicate that the significant upregulation of 
 <italic>ACCase</italic> and 
 <italic>FAS</italic> in FA biosynthesis, the high levels of 
 <italic>SAD</italic> and 
 <italic>FAD2</italic> in FA desaturation, and the stabilization of oil bodies by oleosin allow 
 <italic>A. trifoliata</italic> to accumulate high levels of oil. In 
 <italic>Jatropha</italic>, increased expression of FA biosynthesis genes and oleosins synergistically results in the accumulation of high levels of oil in kernels (~63%)
