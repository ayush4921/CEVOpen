<p id="Par11">We examined the evolutionary relationships among 
 <italic>A. trifoliata</italic>, two eurosid species (
 <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, 
 <italic>Vitis vinifera</italic>), three basal eudicot species (
 <italic>Aquilegia coerulea</italic>, 
 <italic>Papaver somniferum</italic>, and 
 <italic>Nelumbo nucifera</italic>), two core eudicot oilseed species (
 <italic>Sesamum indicum</italic>, 
 <italic>Olea europaea</italic>), a monocot species (
 <italic>Oryza sativa</italic>), and 
 <italic>Amborella trichopoda. A. trichopoda</italic>, one of the basal angiosperm species, represents a sister group to other flowering plants

 </sup>. By using gene family cluster analysis, we identified 12,831 gene families in 
 <italic>A. trifoliata</italic>, of which 399 were unique gene families containing 1,028 genes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6</xref>). Of those species
 <italic>, P. somniferum</italic> possessed the most genes (62,879) and unique gene families (2,394) owing to a relatively recent whole-genome duplication (WGD) event
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>
 </sup>. Then, we further compared the gene families among the four basal eudicot species. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>, 10,268 gene families were shared by 
 <italic>A. coerulea</italic>, 
 <italic>P. somniferum</italic>, 
 <italic>N. nucifera</italic>, and 
 <italic>A. trifoliata</italic>. Compared with two other basal eudicot species, 
 <italic>P. somniferum</italic> (2,662) and 
 <italic>A. coerulea</italic> (1,085), 
 <italic>A. trifoliata</italic> had fewer unique gene families (461). There were more shared gene family clusters between 
 <italic>A. trifoliata</italic> and 
 <italic>A. coerulea</italic> (11,611) than with any two of the other three species. Hence, we inferred a relatively close taxonomic relationship between the two species.
