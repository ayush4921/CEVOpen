<p id="Par12">In total, 197 conserved single-copy orthologs were identified from the 10 species and were used to construct the phylogenetic tree with 
 <italic>O. sativa</italic> and 
 <italic>A. trichopoda</italic> serving as outgroups (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 
 <italic>A. trifoliata</italic> is closely related to 
 <italic>A. coerulea</italic> and forms a clade with 
 <italic>P. somniferum</italic> and 
 <italic>N. nucifera</italic>, which supports the well-established hypothesis of a close relationship between basal eudicot species

 </sup>. Based on the phylogenetic tree, we determined that 246 and 473 gene families were expanded and contracted, respectively, in 
 <italic>A. trifoliata</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S7</xref>). Gene ontology analysis also revealed that “supramolecular complex” and “cell-killing” appeared exclusively in expanded gene families, while “extracellular region part”, “cell proliferation”, and “biological adhesion” arose exclusively in contracted gene families (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S6</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S8</xref>).
