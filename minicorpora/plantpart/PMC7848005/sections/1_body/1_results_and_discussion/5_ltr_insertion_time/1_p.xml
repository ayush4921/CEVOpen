 <italic>A. trifoliata</italic> genome, we estimated the intrasequence divergence of identified full-length LTR elements. We discovered that massive recent insertion events of LTRs occurred in 
 <italic>A. trifoliata</italic> within the last one million years and in 
 <italic>A. coerulea</italic> and 
 <italic>O. sativa</italic>, which explains the accumulation of many recent LTRs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>). The LTR amplifications were inferred to have taken place during the Pleistocene epoch in which freezing occurred and there was limited atmospheric CO

 </sup>. Such an ongoing amplification of LTRs may have contributed to an especially large proportion of LTRs in 
 <italic>A. trifoliata</italic>. Furthermore, the estimation of insertion times of LTRs suggests that 
 <italic>N. nucifera</italic> and 
 <italic>O. europaea</italic> experienced amplification events 2â€“5 million years earlier than 
 <italic>A. trifoliata</italic>.
