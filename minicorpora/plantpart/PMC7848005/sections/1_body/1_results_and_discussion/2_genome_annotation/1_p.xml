<p id="Par9">A total of 25,598 protein-coding genes were predicted in the 
 <italic>A. trifoliata</italic> genome through a combination of 
 <italic>ab</italic> initio prediction, homology search, and RNA-Seq prediction. Of all the predicted protein-coding genes, 24,814 (97%) were annotated based on homology search and RNA-Seq reads, with only 3.1% deriving solely from 
 <italic>ab</italic> initio gene prediction, suggesting that the results of the protein-coding gene prediction were high quality (Fig. S
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">5a</xref>). The 
 <italic>A. trifoliata</italic> genome had an average gene length of 6,47 kb and average exon and intron lengths of 1,62 kb and 4,86 kb, respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). By similarity search, 25,008 protein-coding genes (98%) had functional annotations in public databases from several species, including 
 <italic>N. nucifera</italic> (57.51%), 
 <italic>V. vinifera</italic> (13.91%),
