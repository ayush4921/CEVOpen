 </sup>. A total of 485.55â€‰Mb (71%) of the 
 <italic>A. trifoliata</italic> genome was identified as repetitive sequences, which is the same as the proportion in 
 <italic>P. somniferum</italic> (71%)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>
 </sup> and higher than that in 
 <italic>M. cordata</italic> (63%)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>
 </sup>, both of which are medicinal plants and basal eudicots. Approximately 87% of 
 <italic>A. trifoliata</italic> repetitive sequences were classified as transposable elements (TEs) (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>). TEs occupy a significant fraction of many eukaryotic genomes and play an important role in the increase in genome size among angiosperms
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>
 </sup>. In our assembly, retrotransposon (Class I) and DNA transposon (Class II) TEs accounted for 72% and 7% of the genome, respectively. Among all TEs, long terminal repeats (LTRs) were the most abundant category of TEs, with 32% 
 <italic>gypsy</italic> and 10% 
 <italic>copia</italic>. Interestingly, the proportion of Penelope-like element/large retrotransposon derivative (LARD) elements in 
 <italic>A. trifoliata</italic> was higher than that in most sequenced plant species, accounting for 21% of the genome. LARDs are considered to be nonautonomous elements and are the remnants of the deletion of autonomous LTR retrotransposons

 </sup>. Recent lineage-specific radiation of LARDs (13% of the whole genome) in the pomegranate genome is responsible for fruit development, such as coloration, by affecting the expression of putative 
 <italic>UDP-glucose:flavonoid glucosyltransferase</italic> (
 <italic>UFGT</italic>) and 
 <italic>MYB</italic> genes
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>
 </sup>. The abundant LARD elements in the 
 <italic>A. trifoliata</italic> genome might also have a close relationship with many important characteristics, including secondary metabolite accumulation, as in pomegranate.
