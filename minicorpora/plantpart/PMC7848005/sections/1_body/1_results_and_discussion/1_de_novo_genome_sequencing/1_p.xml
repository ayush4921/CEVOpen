<p id="Par7">The genome of 
 <italic>A. trifoliata</italic> was initially sequenced and assembled using the HiSeq X Ten sequencing platform from Illumina and PacBio single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing technology, and the assembled contigs were anchored to pseudochromosomes using the Hi-C technique. K-mer analysis revealed that the estimated genome size of 
 <italic>A. trifoliata</italic> was 669.76 Mb with a heterozygosity of 0.89% (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Furthermore, the genome size of 
 <italic>A. trifoliata</italic> was estimated to be 654.34 Mb using flow cytometry (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). In total, 193.71 Gb of high-quality sequences with a depth of 284-fold of the 
 <italic>A. trifoliata</italic> genome were used to assemble the genome (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). To obtain further chromosomal information about 
 <italic>A. trifoliata</italic>, the sequences were then scaffolded and corrected using optical mapping data, and the resulting scaffolds were clustered into 16 pseudochromosomes (2
 <italic>n</italic> = 32), accounting for 98.05% (668.89/682.14 Mb) of the genome (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). The final chromosome-scale genome was 682.14 Mb in length with 689 contigs (contig N50 = 6.20 Mb) and 109 scaffolds (scaffolds N50 = 43.11 Mb) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The final assembled sequence 682.14 Mb for 
 <italic>A. trifoliata</italic> was close to the calculated estimated size (669.76 Mb) and to the size estimated by flow cytometry (654.34 Mb). The assembled size was marginally larger than the estimated size, probably because of the relatively high content of repetitive sequences (71.18%).
