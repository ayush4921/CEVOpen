<p id="Par8">In the sequencing and assembly quality assessment, 98.56% of Illumina short-insert reads could be aligned back to the final assembly. Moreover, BUSCO analysis showed that 1518 (94%) of the 1614 orthologs from the Embryophyta database were completely captured in our assembly, and CEGMA analysis showed that the assembled genome completely recalled 424 (93%) of the 458 core eukaryotic genes (CEGs) and 186 (75%) of the 248 highly conserved CEGs (Fig.
