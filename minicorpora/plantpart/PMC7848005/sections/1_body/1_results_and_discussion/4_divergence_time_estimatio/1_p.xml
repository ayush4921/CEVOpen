<p id="Par13">Using MCMCtree, we estimated that the divergence between 
 <italic>A. trifoliata</italic> and 
 <italic>A. coerulea</italic>, which occurred ~94.94 Mya, whereas 
 <italic>P. somniferum</italic> divergence occurred ~108.61 Mya (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). The previous estimates indicate that the divergence between 
 <italic>A. coerulea</italic> and 
 <italic>M. cordata</italic> occurred approximately 115.24 Mya

 <italic>A. coerulea</italic> and 
 <italic>A. trifoliata</italic> than between 
 <italic>A. coerulea</italic> and 
 <italic>M. cordata</italic>. The constructed tree provides the overall divergence time of important basal eudicot species. WGD has been found in almost all fundamental lineages of land plants and is considered a driver of diversity and adaptation

 </sup>. The fourfold degenerate site transversion (4DTv) value revealed one peak at ~0.2 in 
 <italic>A. trifoliata</italic>, which implies that it may have undergone WGD after divergence from 
 <italic>V. vinifera</italic> and 
 <italic>N. nucifera</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>). An ancient paleohexaploidy (γ) event, occurring ~125 Mya, was detected in the common ancestor of all sequenced eudicot genomes
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>
 </sup>. According to the phylogenetic analysis and 4DTv values, we inferred that the γ event was absent in 
 <italic>A. trifoliata</italic>, which is a basal eudicot species, as well as in the basal eudicot species lotus and 
 <italic>M. cordata</italic>
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>
