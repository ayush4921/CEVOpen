 <italic>Brassica napus</italic> L. (rapeseed or canola) is the third largest source of oilseed crop, which is widely cultivated across the globe [

 <xref rid="B5-ijms-22-01033" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-ijms-22-01033" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The seeds of 
 <italic>B. napus</italic> are rich in oil content and fatty acids, which include primarily oleic and linoleic acid [
 <xref rid="B7-ijms-22-01033" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, erucic acid and glucosinolates are anti-nutritive compounds that are present in the 
 <italic>B. napus</italic> seeds that are not desirable for human consumption or as fodder for animal consumption [

 <xref rid="B9-ijms-22-01033" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Therefore, enhancing the seed quality with improved oil content has become the major selective trait for rapeseed breeding programs due to the growing global demand for oil production, for their use as bio-fuel, animal fodder, and vegetable oil [
