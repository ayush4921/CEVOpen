0: However, today it is well known that transcription factors (TFs) and their complex interplay ccontrol gene expression.
1: Until now, several studies showed that TFs in plants are key regulatory elements controlling the expression of several genes, thereby regulating a variety of essential biological processes, like growth, tissue development, differentiation, metabolism, homeostasis, and adaptation to the environment [ 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34].
2: Especially in terms of developmental switches and specifying cellular fate in eukaryotes, the orchestration of cell differentiation changes its direction, depending on the specific gene regulatory events that are governed by TFs and their preferential partner choices (for a review see [ 35]).
3: Thus, the knowledge regarding TFs and their cooperations could provide new insight into the genetic programs regulating various biological processes.
