0: Oil crops have been gaining great economic importance in agriculture as well as in the trade world during the past years [ 1, 2], and the consumption of vegetable oil is anticipated to double by the year 2030 [ 3].
1: Brassica napus L. (rapeseed or canola) is the third largest source of oilseed crop, which is widely cultivated across the globe [ 4, 5, 6].
2: The seeds of  B. napus are rich in oil content and fatty acids, which include primarily oleic and linoleic acid [ 7].
3: However, erucic acid and glucosinolates are anti-nutritive compounds that are present in the  B. napus seeds that are not desirable for human consumption or as fodder for animal consumption [ 8, 9].
4: Therefore, enhancing the seed quality with improved oil content has become the major selective trait for rapeseed breeding programs due to the growing global demand for oil production, for their use as bio-fuel, animal fodder, and vegetable oil [ 10, 11, 12].
