<p>Despite the rich literature on TFs and their cooperations, today there is still a need to unravel the complex interplay of transcription factors orchestrating the seed oil content in 
 <italic>B. napus</italic>. For this purpose, in this study we analysed a time series RNA-seq data set of seed tissue of two 
 <italic>B. napus</italic> cultivars: Zhongshuang11 (ZS11), a double-low accession with high-oil- content and Zhongyou821 (ZY821), a double-high accession with low-oil-content. Unlike the previous studies [

 <xref rid="B27-ijms-22-01033" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], we investigated the genes with monotonic expression patterns, known as Monotonically Expressed Genes (MEGs), in order to capture the multi-stage progression during seed development. The consideration of the MEGs is promising for capturing the multi-stage progression processes that are directed by the combinatorial interplay of the TFs [

We computationally identified the interplay between the TFs for both cultivars in order to decipher the gene regulatory mechanisms controlling the specific expression pattern of MEGs. Our results show that a vast majority of the TFs are overlapping in both cultivars, while few TFs changes their partners, which could be controlling the switches of developmental programs regarding the oil content of both cultivars.
