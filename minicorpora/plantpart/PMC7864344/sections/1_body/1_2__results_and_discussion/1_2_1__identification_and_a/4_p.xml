<p>The GO enrichment results regarding the MEGs of ZS11 cultivar revealed that the ascending MEGs are significantly enriched mainly in the term “fatty acid metabolism” (see 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-22-01033">Figure S1</xref>), which is highly associated with oil content. Other enriched GO terms, including “sucrose biosynthetic process”, “glycerophospholipid synthetic process”, “sphingolipid metabolic process”, and “galactose metabolic process” are greatly relevant to fatty acid synthesis and accumulation processes. In contrast, for the descending MEGs of the ZS11 cultivar (see 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-22-01033">Figure S2</xref>), the GO term “protein phosphorylation” is significantly enriched that represents particularly the inverse correlation of oil and protein levels [
 <xref rid="B38-ijms-22-01033" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] in rapeseed. The GO terms indicate that the increasing pattern of MEGs in fatty acid metabolism could contribute to seed oil content of the rapeseed in ZS11 cultivar.
