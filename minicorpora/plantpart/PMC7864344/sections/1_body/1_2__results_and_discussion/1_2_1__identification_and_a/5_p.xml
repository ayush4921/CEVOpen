<p>On the other hand, the enrichment analysis of ascending MEGs that were obtained for ZY821 cultivar showed that several significantly enriched GO terms are linked to the “thiamine metabolism”, which is associated with the adaptation to biotic and abiotic stress [

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-22-01033">Figure S3</xref>). Reversely, for the descending MEGs, GO terms that are related to biological processes, such as “lipid metabolism”, “carbohydrate metabolism”, “GDP-mannose metabolism”, and “sulphur compound metabolism” show that genes that are involved in multiple metabolic processes are following the decreasing pattern in the seeds of ZY821 cultivar during the germination process, especially of lipids (see 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-22-01033">Figure S4</xref>). These results imply that the seeds of ZY821 cultivar might be involved in stress responses while diminishing the other metabolic processes, especially those that are related to oil synthesis.
