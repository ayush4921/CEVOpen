<p>Analysing the time series data set of 
 <italic>B. napus</italic> seeds from the two cultivars ZS11 and ZY821, we have obtained the MEGs for each cultivar, which are monotonically expressed either in ascending or descending patterns during the seed development. 
 <xref rid="ijms-22-01033-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> provides the numbers of MEGs obtained for each cultivar and the obtained MEGs are listed in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-22-01033">Supplementary Table S1</xref>. 
 <xref rid="ijms-22-01033-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows that there is a comparatively large number of MEGs (both ascending and descending MEGs) for the ZS11 cultivar in comparison to these of the ZY821 cultivar.
