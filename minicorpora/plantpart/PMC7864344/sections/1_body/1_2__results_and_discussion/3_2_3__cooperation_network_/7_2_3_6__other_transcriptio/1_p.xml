<p>There are other crucial transcription factors, like CAMTA2 and CAMTA3, found for both cultivars or ARR11 as well as ID1 found only for the ZS11 cultivar. The roles of these TFs are well studied in biotic and abiotic stress responses [

 <xref rid="B87-ijms-22-01033" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>,

 <xref rid="B89-ijms-22-01033" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. For example, CAMTA2/3 are calmodulin binding transcription factors linking calcium signalling to the induction of defense response genes during abiotic and biotic stress conditions [

 <xref rid="B89-ijms-22-01033" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. They are involved in low temperature and freezing tolerance in 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B87-ijms-22-01033" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Further, the factor ARR11, encoding the 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> response regulator 11, is implicated for its essential role in mediating abscisic acid and cytokinin signalling pathways and tolerance to drought, thereby it is involved in the generation of drought stress responses [
 <xref rid="B59-ijms-22-01033" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-22-01033">Figure S5 in Supplementary Information</xref> gives the expression profile of ARR11. In contrary, the ID1 (Indeterminate Domain) transcription factor found in the cooperation network of ZS11 (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-01033-f002">Figure 2</xref>) encodes a zinc finger, which has been reported in the regulation of seed development in maize [
 <xref rid="B90-ijms-22-01033" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>,
 <xref rid="B91-ijms-22-01033" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. In 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, it is regarded to activate or inhibit seed germination, with respect to gibberellic acid [
 <xref rid="B90-ijms-22-01033" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Because there is a close association between the stress responses and the contribution of triacylglycerol, which is a major lipid reserve [
 <xref rid="B92-ijms-22-01033" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>], this could explain the contribution of TFs to multiple processes, including fatty acid accumulation, seed germination, and the generation of stress responses.
