<p>We identified four unique HD-ZIP family members (ATHB-13, ATHB-18, ATHB-40 and ATHB-53) for the ZY821 cultivar while comparing the cooperation networks of the ZS11 and ZY821 cultivars (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-01033-f002">Figure 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-01033-f003">Figure 3</xref>). Interestingly, our comparitive analysis reveals that the transcription factors ANL2 and ATHB-6 cooperate with the same partners in both networks.

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-01033-f008">Figure 8</xref> show the changes in the expression levels of the orthologous genes of both TFs. When considering the expression profiles of ANL2 orthologous genes (
 <italic>BnaA03g27000D</italic>, 
 <italic>BnaC03g31960D</italic>), the gene expression values of both genes show higher expression levels until day 15 after flowering and they are decreasing after day 15 in ZS11. Whereas, the ANL2 orthologous gene is expressed at high expression levels in an early stage and is declined afterwards during subsequent stages (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-01033-f007">Figure 7</xref>). In contrary to ANL2, the ATHB-6 orthologous genes (
 <italic>BnaA09g42630D</italic>, and 
 <italic>BnaC08g35090D</italic>) show higher expression levels in ZS11 in the early stage (day 7) and lower expression level in ZY821. Intriguingly, these expression levels are continuously decreasing in ZS11 during the seed developmental stages. On the other hand, 
 <italic>BnaA09g42630D</italic> and 
 <italic>BnaC08g35090D</italic> are antagonistically expressed to each other in the ZY821 cultivar.
