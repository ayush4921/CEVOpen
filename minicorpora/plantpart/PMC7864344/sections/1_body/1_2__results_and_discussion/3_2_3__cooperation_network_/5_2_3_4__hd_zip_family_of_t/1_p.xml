<p>Multiple transcription factors from the cooperation networks, including HDG1, HDG11, ANL2, ATHB-6, ATHB-13, ATHB-40, and ATHB-53, belong to the homeodomain zipper family (see

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-01033-f003">Figure 3</xref>). From this family of proteins, GL2 was the first identified protein that is responsible for the outgrowth of trichome in the epidermis [

 <xref rid="B67-ijms-22-01033" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Additionally, other members of this family have similar functions that are associated with the epidermis [
 <xref rid="B68-ijms-22-01033" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Moreover, the factor ANL2 is implicated in the regulation of anthocyanin accumulation in the shoot and also in the development of root [
 <xref rid="B69-ijms-22-01033" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Several studies have reported the functioning of the HD-ZIP family of transcription factors in the cuticle development. HDG11 has been implicated as a positive regulator of drought stress tolerance [
 <xref rid="B70-ijms-22-01033" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Furthermore, the overexpression of 
 <italic>OCL1</italic> in maize belonging to HD-ZIP family highly influenced the expression levels of various genes that are associated with lipid metabolism [
 <xref rid="B71-ijms-22-01033" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Regarding the functioning of ATHB-6, it has been reported as a regulator of ABA hormone responses and it is also regarded as a target of protein phosphatase ABI1, which is a negative regulator of TAG accumulation and ABA signalling [

 <xref rid="B74-ijms-22-01033" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Moreover, ATHB-53 is regarded as an auxin-inducible protein and it plays a prominent role in the auxin/cytokinin pathway during root development [
 <xref rid="B75-ijms-22-01033" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. However, several members of this family are related to the epidermis development [
 <xref rid="B68-ijms-22-01033" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], which is also an integral part of the seed coat.
