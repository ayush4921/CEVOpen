<p>Taking a closer look into the cooperation networks of ZS11 and ZY821 reveals that the majority of the single TFs are overlapping in the networks of both cultivars, while a few of them change their partners. Among several transcription factors in the cooperation networks of ZS11 and ZY821, a majority of them belong predominantly to five TF families: NAC, MYB, DOF, GATA, and the HD-ZIP family. Hence, in our further analysis, we mainly focused on the members of these TF families and their preferential partner choices in order to explain, in detail, their relevance for fatty acid synthesis, transport, and accumulation in the seed tissue of
