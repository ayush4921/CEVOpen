<p>Another interesting family of transcription factors observed in the networks of ZS11 and ZY821 is the GATA family of transcription factors (namely GATA8, GATA12, and GATA15), which contain type-IV zinc finger motifs. GATA transcription factors have been identified in the regulatory regions of the light-responsive genes [
 <xref rid="B53-ijms-22-01033" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], especially genes that are associated with photosynthesis e.g., the chlorophyll a/b binding protein [

 <xref rid="B55-ijms-22-01033" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. They play a pivotal role as regulators that are involved in the nitrogen assimilation process in plants [

 <xref rid="B57-ijms-22-01033" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Additionally, few members of the GATA family have also been identified as a differentially expressed TF family while comparing high- and low-yielding oil palm [
 <xref rid="B58-ijms-22-01033" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], which could also explain their major role in rapeseed. In particular, we identified GATA8 with its cooperation partner ARR14 for both cultivars, while GATA12 as well as GATA15 with their cooperation partners ARR11 and ARR14, have only been found for the ZS11 cultivar (see

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-01033-f003">Figure 3</xref>). This finding suggests that, during the seed germination processs, these three GATA family members form dimers with ARR family TFs, which play essential roles in stress responses (involving triacylglycerol) [
