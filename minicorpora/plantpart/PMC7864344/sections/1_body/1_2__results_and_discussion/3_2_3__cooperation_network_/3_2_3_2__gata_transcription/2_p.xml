<p>Furthermore, we observed a strong increment in the expression levels of

 <italic>BnaA09g34590D</italic> until day 15 after flowering in the ZS11 cultivar in comparison to ZY821 while taking the expression profiles of five GATA8 orthologous genes (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-01033-f005">Figure 5</xref>). Interestingly, in both cultivars, the gene expression values of all five orthologous genes abruptly decreases during the late stage of seed development. Similar patterns of the changes in the expression values during the seed development have been obtained for GATA12 and GATA15 orthologous genes (see
