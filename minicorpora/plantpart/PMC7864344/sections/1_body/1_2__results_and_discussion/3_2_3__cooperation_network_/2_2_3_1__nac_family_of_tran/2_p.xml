<p>Moreover, when considering the orthologous genes of NAC92 in 
 <italic>B. napus</italic>, we identified four gene IDs (
 <italic>BnaA04g09470D</italic>, 
 <italic>BnaA07g14730D</italic>, 
 <italic>BnaC04g31690D</italic>, and 
 <italic>BnaC06g12550D</italic>) while using the Ensembl plant database [
 <xref rid="B51-ijms-22-01033" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,
 <xref rid="B52-ijms-22-01033" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The gene expression values of these genes show different patterns in both cultivars, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-01033-f004">Figure 4</xref>. Especially, 
 <italic>BnaC06g12550D</italic> is clearly showing an increasing trend after 10 days of flowering in ZS11 (time point 2 in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-01033-f004">Figure 4</xref>), while its expression level, together with that of 
 <italic>BnaA04g09470D</italic>, is decreasing in ZY821 during the late stage (day 45 after flowering) of seed development. However, the analysis of ANAC050 orthologous genes in 
 <italic>B. napus</italic> reveals that their expression patterns are similar in both of the cultivars (see
