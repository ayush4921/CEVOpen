<p>The NAC family members NAC92 and ANAC050 are found with different partners in the cooperation networks of ZS11 and ZY821 (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-01033-f002">Figure 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-01033-f003">Figure 3</xref>). This family encodes NAC (NAM, ATAF1, -2, and CUC2) domain transcription factors that are exclusively found in plants and well-studied for their functioning in abiotic stress responses [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-01033-f002">Figure 2</xref>, we observed that, while NAC92 cooperates with the transcription factors BIM1 and WRKY48, the factor ANAC050 cooperates with AT3G24120. Particularly, NAC92 has been reported in several plant species in controlling the age-dependent senescence and seed germination processes [
 <xref rid="B49-ijms-22-01033" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Therefore, it could play a crucial part in determining the seed oil content, as senescence directly affects the quality of seeds. On the other hand, ANAC050 has been studied in transcriptional repression and flowering time control [
 <xref rid="B50-ijms-22-01033" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and, thus, its cooperation with AT3G24120 (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-01033-f003">Figure 3</xref>) could potentially play negative roles in fatty acid accumulation.
