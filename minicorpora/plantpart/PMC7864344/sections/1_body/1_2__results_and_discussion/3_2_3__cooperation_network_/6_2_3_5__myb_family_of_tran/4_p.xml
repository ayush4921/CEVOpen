<p>The gene expression analysis of MYB1 and MYB4 orthologous genes show that the corresponding expression levels are clearly different between ZS11 and ZY821 cultivars. In particular, there is a remarkable increase in the expression level of the MYB1 orthologous genes 
 <italic>BnaC03g63160D</italic> during the late stage after flowering in the ZY821 cultivar (&gt;day 15) (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-01033-f009">Figure 9</xref>). Another interesting pattern has been observed for the MYB4 orthologous gene 
 <italic>BnaA08g16990D</italic>: While its expression level increases until day 15 after flowering in ZY821 cultivar, it sharply decreases at the late stage (day 45) (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-01033-f010">Figure 10</xref>).
