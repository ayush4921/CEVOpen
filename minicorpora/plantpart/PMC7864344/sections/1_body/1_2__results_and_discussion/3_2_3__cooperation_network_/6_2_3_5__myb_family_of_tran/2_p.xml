<p>Interestingly, the factor MYB24 cooperates with MYB46, MYB55, and MYB65 during seed development in both of the cultivars. Taking its unique cooperations into account, MYB24 forms dimers with F3A4.140 and AT1G76870 in the ZS11 cultivar (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-01033-f002">Figure 2</xref>). On the other hand, MYB24 is interacting with MYB1 in ZY821 (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-01033-f003">Figure 3</xref>). Regarding the function of MYB1, it has been characterised as a pivotal positive regulator of the anthocyanin synthesis in onion, thus representing an important player in the flavanoid synthesis pathway on the transcriptional level [
