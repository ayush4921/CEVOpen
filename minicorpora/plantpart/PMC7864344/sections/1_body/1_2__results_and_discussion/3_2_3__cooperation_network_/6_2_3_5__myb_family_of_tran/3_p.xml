<p>A similar role has been studied for MYB113 in purple cauliflower [
 <xref rid="B82-ijms-22-01033" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>] and for FaEOBII in the phenypropanoid pathway in strawberries [
 <xref rid="B83-ijms-22-01033" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Likewise, MYB4 has been reported in 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> for its dual role in the flavanoid biosynthetic pathway, describing the precise regulation of anthocyanin and phenylalanine synthesis [
 <xref rid="B84-ijms-22-01033" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. The role of flavonoid snythesis pathway genes in contributing to seed colour that differentiates between high-oil content and low-oil content accessions has been well-reported in [
 <xref rid="B26-ijms-22-01033" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. More importantly, the transcription factor MYB46 functions as a master regulator in the secondary wall synthesis, regulating the genes that are involved in the synthesis of three major components (cellulose, hemi cellulose, and lignin) of secondary cell walls [
 <xref rid="B85-ijms-22-01033" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Therefore, it is a modulator in the regulation of defense responses to the fungus 
 <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic> [
