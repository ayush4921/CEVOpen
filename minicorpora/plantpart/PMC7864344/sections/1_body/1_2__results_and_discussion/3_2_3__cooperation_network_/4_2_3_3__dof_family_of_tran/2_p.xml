<p>In the cooperation network for ZS11 (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-01033-f002">Figure 2</xref>), there is unique cooperation between the TFs DOF5.7 and ID1. On the other hand, the factor DOF5.7 with its cooperation partners OBP4 and AP3 have been found to be unique for the network for ZY821 (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-01033-f003">Figure 3</xref>). Furthermore, we found that the factor DAG2 cooperates with AT1G47655 and ADOF1 (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-01033-f003">Figure 3</xref>). Given the importance of the DOF family of TFs in influencing the oil content, these preferential partner choices of DOF5.7 could be playing important roles in differentiating the regulatory processes in the seeds of the ZS11 and ZY821 cultivars.
