<p>Importantly, we identified several DOF family members (DOF2.5, DOF5.7, DAG2, CDF2, AT2G28810, AT3G52440, OBP4, ADOF1, AT1G47655) in the cooperation networks of ZS11 and ZY821 (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-01033-f002">Figure 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-01033-f003">Figure 3</xref>). This family of transcription factors, encoding zinc finger protein, is specific for plants, and it is not found in other eukaryotes [
 <xref rid="B60-ijms-22-01033" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. They have been found to be particularly implicated in controlling seed germination, seed storage, and the mobilisation of proteins and fatty acids [
 <xref rid="B61-ijms-22-01033" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Interestingly, DOF2.5/DAG2 acts as a positive regulator of seed germination [
 <xref rid="B62-ijms-22-01033" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Although the functions of DOFs are not well-characterised with regard to seed oil content in 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the soybean genes 
 <italic>GmDof4</italic> and 
 <italic>GmDof11</italic> are shown to increase the seed oil content by directly inducing the acetyl CoA carboxylase and long-chain-acyl CoA synthetase synthesis genes [
 <xref rid="B63-ijms-22-01033" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] that are involved in fatty acid synthesis and metabolism [
 <xref rid="B63-ijms-22-01033" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,
 <xref rid="B64-ijms-22-01033" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Likewise, the overexpression of 
 <italic>GhDOF1</italic> (
 <italic>Gossypium hirsutum</italic>) leads to increased lipid levels of cotton [
 <xref rid="B65-ijms-22-01033" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>].
