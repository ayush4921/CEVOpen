<p>For the better understanding of the transcriptional regulation underlying oil synthesis in the seeds of 
 <italic>B. napus</italic> and, thereby deciphering specific regulatory programs differentiating between double low and double high cultivars of 
 <italic>B. napus</italic>, we analysed the promoter regions of the MEGs of both cultivars of 
 <italic>B. napus</italic>. Consequently, we identified cooperative transcription factors (TFs) using the algorithm of PC-TraFF, similar to our other studies [

 <xref rid="B43-ijms-22-01033" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The obtained cooperative TF pairs are depicted as cooperation networks in which the elliptical nodes represent the individual TFs, whereas the edges (grey lines in the cooperation networks) represent the cooperation between the TFs (see

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-01033-f003">Figure 3</xref>). The cooperation networks comprise 42 and 54 cooperative TF pairs for ZS11 and ZY821, respectively. The overlapping TFs between the two cooperation networks are shaded in orange and TFs of the cooperation network unique to a particular cultivar are shaded in yellow. Remarkably, a brief analysis of the cooperation networks reveals that there are only five and 17 TFs unique to ZS11 and ZY821, respectively.
