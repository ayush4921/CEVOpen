 <xref rid="B37-ijms-22-01033" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], we performed the gene set enrichment analysis in order to obtain GO (Gene Ontology) terms on “biological process” regarding the ascending and descending set of MEGs for both ZS11 and ZY821 cultivars. Fisher’s exact test was applied and a GO term was considered to be statistically significant if its corresponding FDR value ≤0.05. The enriched GO terms were visualised as tree map while using REVIGO [
