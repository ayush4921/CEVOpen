<p>In this study, we use a publicly available time series transcriptomic data set of the seeds that were obtained from two 
 <italic>B. napus</italic> cultivars with different seed oil content, namely Zhongshuang11 (ZS11), a double-low accession with high-oil-content, and Zhongyou821 (ZY821), a double-high accession with low-oil-content. The RNA-sequencing of the seeds from both cultivars at four different time points, namely day 7, day 10, day 15, and day 45 after flowering, with two biological replicates each were generated by Lu et al. [
