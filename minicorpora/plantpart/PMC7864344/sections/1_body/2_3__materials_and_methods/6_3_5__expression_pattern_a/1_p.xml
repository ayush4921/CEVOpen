<p>Following the analysis strategy of Zeidler et al. [
 <xref rid="B43-ijms-22-01033" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], we analysed the changes in the expression values of TF genes during the seed developmental stages to gather knowledge on the combinatorial gene regulation underlying the differentiation of the oil content between the two cultivars. For this purpose, we determined, for each TF, whose gene symbol is often defined in 
 <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> or 
 <italic>Zea mays</italic>, its orthologous genes in 
 <italic>B. napus</italic> while using the Ensembl plant database [
