<p>Transcriptional regulation in plants plays a pivotal role in governing a variety of physiological processes. In oil crops, like 
 <italic>B. napus</italic>, a deeper knowledge regarding TFs and their combinatorial interplay sheds light into the regulatory mechanisms that underlie seed oil content, particularly in the accumulation of fatty acids. In our study, by analysing a RNA-seq data set of seed tissue from two 
 <italic>B.napus</italic> accessions, a double-low accession with high-oil-content and a double-high accession with low-oil-content, we identified several TFs and their preferential partner choices, which are likely to influence the quality of seed oil content. Interestingly, some of the TFs have the same cooperation partners in both cultivars, whereas the gene expression patterns of their orthologous genes clearly show distinguishing patterns between the cultivars during the seed development process. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study performing a systematic analysis to decipher the complex interplay of the TFs that are linked with developmental switches resulting in a higher oil content. Our findings could be promising for deepening the existing knowledge on the transcriptional regulation governing seed oil content notwithstanding the absence of experimental validation. Therefore, further progress from the molecular plant biology end is needed, not only to validate the functions of these TFs, but also for a future perspective on generating novel hypotheses in genetic programs that involve seed oil improvement.
