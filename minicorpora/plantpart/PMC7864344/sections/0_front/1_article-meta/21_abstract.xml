 <p>Transcription factors (TFs) and their complex interplay are essential for directing specific genetic programs, such as responses to environmental stresses, tissue development, or cell differentiation by regulating gene expression. Knowledge regarding TFâ€“TF cooperations could be promising in gaining insight into the developmental switches between the cultivars of 
  <italic>Brassica napus</italic> L., namely Zhongshuang11 (ZS11), a double-low accession with high-oil- content, and Zhongyou821 (ZY821), a double-high accession with low-oil-content. In this regard, we analysed a time series RNA-seq data set of seed tissue from both of the cultivars by mainly focusing on the monotonically expressed genes (MEGs). The consideration of the MEGs enables the capturing of multi-stage progression processes that are orchestrated by the cooperative TFs and, thus, facilitates the understanding of the molecular mechanisms determining seed oil content. Our findings show that TF families, such as NAC, MYB, DOF, GATA, and HD-ZIP are highly involved in the seed developmental process. Particularly, their preferential partner choices as well as changes in their gene expression profiles seem to be strongly associated with the differentiation of the oil content between the two cultivars. These findings are essential in enhancing our understanding of the genetic programs in both cultivars and developing novel hypotheses for further experimental studies.
