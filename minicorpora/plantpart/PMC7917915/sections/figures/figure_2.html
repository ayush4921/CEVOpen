 <caption> Network pharmacology analysis underlying the theoretical interactions between essential oil phytochemicals, namely α-pinene, α-humulene, E-caryophyllene, E-β-ocimene, myrcene, terpinolene, limonene, selina-4(15),7(11)-diene, selina-3,7(11)-diene, caryophyllene oxide and multiple mouse target proteins, including acetylcholinesterase, cannabinoid CB2 receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α. The molecular targets were identified through the bioinformatics platform SwissTargetPrediction, as well as the components-targets plot was built through Cytoscape software (3.8 version). </caption>
