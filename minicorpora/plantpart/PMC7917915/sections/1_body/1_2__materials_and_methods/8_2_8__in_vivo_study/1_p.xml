<p>The animal model was based on male adult BALB/c mice, supplied by National Institute of Health, Islamabad, Pakistan, whereas Animal and Ethics Committee of the University of Lahore, Islamabad approved current study design for experimental purposes. Standard diet was given to BALB/c mice during experimental plan. For sample administration, BALB/c mice were allocated in 3 groups, the 1st group composed of sample control (2.5 mL/kg, corresponding to 12.5 µg/mL EO in a final volume of 100 µL), the 2nd group had standard drug (positive control: amphotericin B 12.5 mg/kg) and the 3rd group composed of negative control (saline + 0.5% DMSO). Treatments were injected once a day intraperitoneally for 8 weeks. Experimental plan during in vivo study was followed, as previously described [
