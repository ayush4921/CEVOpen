<p>Scavenging/reducing effects were investigated by radical scavenging 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2â€²-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) and reducing power (CUPRAC and FRAP) assays and results were expressed as trolox equivalents (TE). The metal-chelating properties were expressed as ethylenediaminetetraacetic (EDTA) equivalents. Details of the assays were reported in previous studies of ours [
