<p>Three selected cultivars of industrial hemp, namely 
 <italic>Cannabis sativa</italic> L. cultivar ‘
 <italic>Futura 75</italic>’ (F75), 
 <italic>C. sativa</italic> L. cultivar ‘
 <italic>Eletta campana</italic>’ (EC) and 
 <italic>C. sativa</italic> L. cultivar ‘
 <italic>Carmagnola selezionata</italic>’ (CS) were cultivated in experimental crops, in the Abruzzo region and more specifically in the surrounding of the Pescara river valley, Italy (
 <xref rid="biomolecules-11-00272-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). This valley is a typical piedmont-hilly zone of the central-eastern Apennines, which originates from the ecotone between the Gran Sasso and Maiella-Morrone massifs, in the northern and southern part, respectively and declines within 45 km in an extended drainage basin to the Adriatic coast. The basin area expresses the Mediterranean bi-climate characters typical of the Adriatic coast with dry summer characterized by law rainfall. The total extension of the experimental crops were 24,000 square meters on level ground, with a mean slope lower than 5% and altitude range 70–100 m asl. The planting scheme was in lines with a central 2 m irrigation strip widths.
