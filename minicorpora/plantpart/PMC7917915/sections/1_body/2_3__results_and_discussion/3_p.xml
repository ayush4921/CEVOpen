<p>The comparison between the EOs composition points to a basically uniform pool of the phytochemicals. However, the relative abundance of the detected metabolites significantly diverges throughout the analyzed cultivars (
 <xref rid="biomolecules-11-00272-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). More in detail, the metabolite rankings are: myrcene&gt; E-caryophyllene&gt; α-pinene in 
 <italic>Carmagnola selezionata</italic>, E-caryophyllene&gt; α-pinene&gt; myrcene in 
 <italic>Futura 75</italic> and heptacosane &gt; 
 <italic>E</italic>-caryophyllene&gt; α-pinene&gt; myrcene in 
 <italic>Eletta campana</italic>. Myrcene is the main metabolite present in 
 <italic>Carmagnola selezionata</italic> (26.4%), that can be further discriminated by the absence of tetracosane (peak 38), conversely detected in relevant amount in other samples. On the other side, heptacosane (peak 39) is only present in the 
 <italic>Eletta campana</italic> sample (23.9%). The latter contains more complex mixture characterized by the exclusive presence of other six compounds (peaks 16, 17, 25, 26, 30, 33). The quantitative differences as for myrcene (peak 4, range 6.8–26.4%), terpinolene (peak 14, 2.3–7.0%), limonene (peak 9, 1.8–4.7%) and selina-3,7(11)-diene (peak 32, 0.5–2.5%) suggest potentially relevant effects on organoleptic properties. In our previous paper [
 <xref rid="B9-biomolecules-11-00272" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], we have investigated the composition of essential oil obtained from 
 <italic>Futura 75</italic> cultivated in the same area. It is evident a quantitative variability of the essential oil within the same variety expressed by the lowest concentration detected for 
 <italic>E</italic>-caryophyllene, caryophyllene-oxide and α-humulene (28%, 15%, and 13%, respectively in our previous paper) [
 <xref rid="B9-biomolecules-11-00272" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The qualitative variability of this cultivar is evidenced also by comparison with the study of Marini and colleagues [
 <xref rid="B27-biomolecules-11-00272" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] that identified α-pinene&gt; myrcene&gt; 
 <italic>E</italic>-caryophyllene (19%, 17%, and 15%, respectively) as main components of EO obtained from central Italy crop. This is also consistent, albeit partially, with the results from the study of Iseppi and colleagues (2019) [
 <xref rid="B28-biomolecules-11-00272" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]: myrcene&gt; 
 <italic>E</italic>-caryophyllene&gt; α-pinene (19%, 14%, 8%, respectively). Similarly, limited quantitative variations in main compounds (myrcene, 
 <italic>E</italic>-caryophyllene and α-pinene) were recorded in 
 <italic>Carmagnola selezionata</italic> EOs [

 <xref rid="B28-biomolecules-11-00272" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Other information for each cultivar EO is reported in the
