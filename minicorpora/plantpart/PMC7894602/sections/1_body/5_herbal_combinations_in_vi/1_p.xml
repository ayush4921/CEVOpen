 </sup> investigated the antiviral activity of Shigyaku-to in mice and tissue culture cells. Shigyaku-to is the Japanese name for the traditional Chinese herbal medicine Si Ni Tang, which is a combination of Glycyrrhiza glabra, Zingiberis siccatum, and Aconitum carmichaelii at a ratio of 3:2:1. It has been traditionally used for thousands of years in China to treat a variety of infections. To test the antiviral activity of this herbal combination, mice were infected with lethal amounts of HSV-1 (strain KOS) and treated with various doses of Shigyaku-to (1.25-80mg/kg). The strongest antiviral activity was seen with a dose of 20mg/kg where 74% of mice survived infection compared to 100% mortality of mice treated with saline control. Moreover, when infected mice were inoculated with whole spleen cells from uninfected mice treated with Shigyaku-to, survival rate was significantly higher compared to non-inoculated controls. Shigyaku-to’s antiviral mechanism was investigated in Vero cells, but the herbal combination did not show any virucidal or virostatic activities in vitro. The authors suggest that the antiviral mechanism of this herbal combination may be due to stimulation of the body’s antiviral functions in mice.
