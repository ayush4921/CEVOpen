 </sup> studied a Chinese herbal combination called Kakkon-to for its antiherpetic properties. Kakkon-to, which is the Japanese name for the Chinese formula Ge Gan Tang, is a mixture of 24 g Pueraria pseudo-hirsuta radix, 12 g Ephedra sinica herba, 12 g Zizyphi jujuba fructus, 9 g Cinnamomi cassia cortex, 9 g Paeoniae lactiflora radix, 6 g Glycyrrhizae uralensis radix, and 3 g Zingiberis officinale rhizoma. A hot water extract of the herbal mixture was prepared and female BALB/c mice were orally given either 300mg/kg of the extract or water 4 hours pre-infection. Mice were subjected to cutaneous HSV infection by inoculation with HSV-1 strain 7401 H and treated with the same 300mg/kg of extract or water every 8 hours for 7 days. Mice treated with Kakkon-to showed 33% mortality compared to 100% mortality in those untreated. Additionally, the size and severity of lesions significantly decreased in mice treated with Kakkon-to versus those untreated. To study the antiviral effect on an established HSV-1 infection, separate female mice were inoculated with HSV-1 strain 7401 H and were either treated with 330mg/kg Kakkon-to at zero or 18 hours post-infection or were non-treated controls. The appearance of skin lesions was significantly reduced in the treatment groups compared to controls. However, the lesions developed along the same course from vesicular to ulcerated lesions in all groups. The only noted difference was smaller lesion sizes in treated mice regardless of treatment time. The authors concluded that Kakkon-to acted as both a therapeutic and prophylactic agent against HSV-1 cutaneous infection.
