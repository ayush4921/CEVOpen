<p>The therapeutic effect of Carissa edulis extract in BALB/c mice infected with wild-type HSV-1 (strain 7401 H), wild-type HSV-2 (strain Ito-1262), or acyclovir-resistant 7401 H HSV-1 was investigated by Tolo et al.

 </sup> The extract was previously found by the authors to exhibit antiviral effects against HSV-1 and HSV-2 in vitro. Mice were treated post-infection with 250 mg/kg of the extract 3 times a day for 1 week. Onset of infection was significantly delayed by 2 days in both the wild-type and acyclovir-resistant HSV-1 infected mice. Delay of onset of infection in wild-type HSV-2 mice was not significantly different from control. Notably, the delay in onset of infection in wild-type HSV-1 infected mice was similar to the delay observed with treatment with acyclovir. Additionally, a longer survival time and lower mortality rate was observed in wild-type HSV-1 infected mice treated with the herbal extract compared to control.
