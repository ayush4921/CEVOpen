 </sup> found a methanolic extract of Symphyocladia latiuscula to significantly delay the appearance and limit further progression of HSV-1 infection in female BALB/c mice. Mice were inoculated with wild-type HSV-1 (strain 7401 H) and orally administered the extract at a dose of 0.5 mg/mouse 4 hours pre-inoculation and then 3 times a day for 6 to 10 days post-inoculation. The extract significantly delayed the appearance of local vesicles and further progression to mild zosteriform lesions compared to control. Although survival time increased with the extract compared to control, the mortality rate was 100% in both groups. Further experiments evaluated viral yields in the skin and brain of mice treated with the extract at 3 and 6 days post-inoculation. At both 3 and 6 days post-infection, the extract significantly reduced viral yields in the skin, but not in the brain.
