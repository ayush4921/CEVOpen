 </sup> investigated the antiherpetic effects of methanolic extracts of 7 Indonesian medicinal plants in BALB/c mice. The plants studied were Eurycoma longifoli, Filicium decipiens, Garcinia mangostana, Melaleuca leucadendron, Nephelium lappaceum, Punica granatum, and Toona sureni. Extracts were dissolved in 2% dimethyl sulfoxide and orally administered to mice 8 hours before HSV-1 (strain 7401 H) inoculation and 3 times daily post-inoculation. All extracts were able to significantly delay the appearance of vesicles in the local region, but only M. leucadendron and N. lappaceum were able to both limit further development to mild zosteriform lesions and reduce mortality when compared to control. Specifically, N. lappaceum completely inhibited development of mild zosteriform lesions and was the only extract to exhibit similar antiherpetic activity as acyclovir (0.1 mg/mouse was given as comparison). The authors conclude that N. lappaceum has the potential to be used as an anti-HSV-1 treatment in humans.
