Results were reviewed, and studies that used whole plant extracts up to a publication date of April 2020 were included. Studies were excluded if the articleâ€™s full-text was not available. Studies that investigated antiviral effects of constituents from plant extracts were also excluded as the topic of this review is whole plant extracts. A list of all botanicals studied in the articles reviewed is presented in
