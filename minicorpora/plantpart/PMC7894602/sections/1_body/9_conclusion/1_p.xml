<p>Herpes simplex virus affects many individuals around the world as it is easily transmitted from person-to-person due to viral shedding in the absence of symptoms.

 </sup> While HSV infection is not fatal, it is recurrent and as such it can negatively affect an individualâ€™s quality of life. There is no cure for HSV, therefore management strategies are important to prevent and treat HSV outbreaks. The efficacy of current treatments has begun to falter, as seen by emerging viral resistance to nucleoside analogues.

 </sup> Research has studied the ability of various botanicals to fight HSV infections and possibly uncover higher efficacy treatments than currently utilized. HSV may be less likely to develop resistance to botanicals because their various active constituents have various mechanisms of action, for example by targeting viral attachment, penetration, DNA replication, gene expression, or by directly inactivating virions. This gives botanicals a potential benefit over the conventional therapy for HSV, acyclovir, which specifically targets viral replication. Additionally, results suggest that combination therapies have the potential to elicit greater benefits over single therapies. Future research should include human clinical trials that study the combination of botanicals that demonstrate anti-HSV activity in vitro.
