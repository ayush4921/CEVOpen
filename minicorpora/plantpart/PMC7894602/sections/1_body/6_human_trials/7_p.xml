 </sup> prepared an aqueous extract that was subsequently dried to a powder to contain a daily dose of 2 g Wisteria floribunda, 2 g Trapa natans, 2 g Terminalia chebulae, 4 g Coicis lachryma-jobi, 4 g Ganoderma lucidum, and 2 g Elfuinga applanata. Study participants had recurrent HSV infections for at least 1 year and had been treated by external medical professionals without improvement. The study recruited 15 patients with herpes genitalis and 13 patients with herpes labialis. Patients were instructed to take a double daily dose of the herbal combination on days one and 2 of infection and a single daily dose for subsequent days until complete relief. At baseline, the mean time to relief from infection was 10.9 ± 6.3 days for herpes genitalis and 7.8 ± 4.3 days for herpes labialis. After treatment with the herbal combination, the mean time to relief was reduced to 4.9 ± 1.3 days for herpes genitalis and 4.0 ± 1.1 days for herpes labialis. Both reductions were statistically significant. The authors concluded that treatment with this herbal combination provided fast and effective relief from recurrent HSV infections.
