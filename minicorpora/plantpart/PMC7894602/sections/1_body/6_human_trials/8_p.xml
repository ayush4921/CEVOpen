 </sup> conducted a double-blind, randomized, comparative trial to assess the efficacy of 2 herbal creams on herpes labialis lesions. The first cream contained sage extract from leaves of Salvia officinalis, and the second cream contained sage extract and rhubarb extract from the roots of Rheum palmatum and Rheum officinale. The reference treatment was Zovirax, which contained acyclovir (50 mg/g). All subjects were provided a topical treatment. A total of 145 subjects participated in the trial and were split into 3 treatment groups so that 64 received the rhubarb-sage cream, 40 received the sage cream, and 41 received the Zovirax cream. Participantsâ€™ HSV status was assessed by the amount of swelling present and pain associated with lesions. Mean time to healing for the sage, sage-rhubarb, and Zovirax cream groups was 7.1, 6.7, and 6.5 days, respectively, and mean time to crust formation was 7.8, 7.2, and 6.3 days, respectively. Mean time to healing and crust formation were not statistically different between treatments. Additionally, the participants who used the rhubarb-sage extract cream reported less pain than those using the sage extract cream. This study provides a basis of knowledge that herbal remedies, specifically the combination of rhubarb and sage, may be as effective as current pharmacological topical therapies for the treatment of HSV lesions.
