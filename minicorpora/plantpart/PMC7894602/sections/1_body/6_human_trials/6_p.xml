 </sup> prepared an aqueous extract to contain a daily dose of 4 g Coicis semen, 2 g Elfuinga applanata, 4 g Ganoderma lucidum, 2 g Terminalia chebulae, 2 g Trapa natans, and 2 g Wisteria floribunda. One male and 4 females, aged 31-60 years, with recurrent herpes labialis were treated orally with the extract, either taking a single, double, or triple daily dose. For all 5 patients, use of the herbal combination extract significantly reduced the healing time of herpes lesions compared to previous outbreaks when no treatment was used. Lesions crusted and resolved within a few days compared to resolving within approximately 2 weeks with no treatment. In addition, pain associated with outbreaks was significantly reduced for one patient with use of the extract.
