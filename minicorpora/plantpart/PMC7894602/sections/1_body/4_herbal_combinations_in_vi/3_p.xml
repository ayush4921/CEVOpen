 </sup> made an aqueous extract of Long Dan Xie Gan Tang, which consisted of the following 10 Chinese herbs and weights: 32 g Alisma plantago-aquatica, 16 g Akebia quinata, 16 g Angelica sinensis, 32 g Bupleurum chinense, 16 g Gardenia jasminoides, 32 g Gentiana scabra, 16 g Glycyrrhiza uralensis, 16 g Plantago asiatica, 16 g Rehmannia glutinosa, and 16 g Scutellaria baicalensis. The extract showed to inhibit both HSV-1 (strain KOS) and HSV-2 (strain 196) in a dose-dependent manner, but HSV-1 was more susceptible to the extract. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> and SI values, respectively, were determined to be 257.5 μg/ml and 15.8 against HSV-1 and 494.6 μg/ml and 8.2 against HSV-2. Additionally, HSV-2 virions were pretreated with the extract and a decrease in viral infectivity was observed. The authors conclude that Long Dan Xie Gan Tang likely inactivates herpes viruses directly, which is a different mechanism of action than acyclovir.
