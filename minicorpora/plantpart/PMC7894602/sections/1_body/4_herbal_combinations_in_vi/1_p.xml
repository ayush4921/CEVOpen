 </sup> prepared an aqueous extract from 100 g Sambucus nigra, 70 g Hypericum perforatum, and 40 g Saponaria officinalis and investigated the herbal combination’s antiviral effects against HSV-1 (McIntyre strain). The extract was assessed for cytotoxicity in human fetal lung fibroblast (MRC-5) cells and a maximum tolerated concentration was determined to be 250 μg/ml. At a concentration of 200 μg/ml, the extract showed virucidal effects to a 0.01/ml viral dose, but the ability to inactivate virions was only seen at a 0.1/ml viral dose. Moreover, MRC-5 and rabbit kidney (RK-13) cells were infected with HSV-1 and incubated with the extract or control for 24 hours. The extract at a concentration of 250 ug/ml was tested in MRC-5 cells, and concentrations of 100, 150, or 200 ug/ml were tested in RK-13 cells. There was a 2.4 log difference and a 1-3 log difference between control and treatment viral titres in MRC-5 and RK-13 cells, respectively.
