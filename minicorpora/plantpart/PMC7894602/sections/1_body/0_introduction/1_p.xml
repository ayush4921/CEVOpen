<p>Herpes simplex viruses (HSV) are highly contagious, double-stranded DNA viruses that cause recurrent lesions.

 </sup> They affect all age groups around the world, have no seasonal variation, and infect both humans and animals.

 </sup> Appearance of lesions at the primary site of infection can occur following initial infection of abraded skin or mucosal epithelial cells.

 </sup> Subsequently, the virus can establish a lifelong, latent infection in trigeminal or lumbosacral ganglia, which can be reactivated in certain conditions.

 </sup> These conditions include physiological and psychological stress, fatigue, ultraviolet irradiation, physical trauma, abnormal hormone levels, immunosuppression, menstruation, fever, and upper respiratory tract infections.

 </sup> Both primary and recurrent HSV infections may be symptomless, however, reactivation typically produces ulcerations at the primary site.

 </sup> During reactivation, but before physical symptoms arise, HSV can be virally shed, thereby having the ability to be transmitted asymptomatically.
 <sup>
  <xref rid="bibr1-2515690X20978394" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
 </sup> This makes HSV difficult to contain and efficient in spreading person-to-person.
