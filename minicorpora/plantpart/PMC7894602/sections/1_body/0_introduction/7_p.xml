<p>Moreover, the use of oral lysine, an amino acid, in preventing and treating HSV infections has been found to be ineffective at doses of 1 gram per day without consumption of a low arginine diet.

 </sup> The rationale for using lysine comes from tissue culture findings that demonstrate viral replication is suppressed when the ratio of lysine-to-arginine is high.

 </sup> This is also the rationale for why a diet low in arginine can help manage outbreaks, but evidence does not support the use of one without the other.

 </sup> However, treatment with greater than 3 grams of lysine per day has shown to improve the subjective experience associated with HSV infections.

 </sup> Furthermore, one study using a herbal-based ointment consisting of lysine combined with ingredients such as zinc oxide, echinacea, and goldenseal found complete resolution of herpes labialis outbreaks by day three in 40% of participants.

 </sup> The benefits of this herbal ointment could be due to the diverse constituents in combined botanicals that act through various mechanisms of actions, compared to a single ingredient as treatment.
