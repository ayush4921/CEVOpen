<p>Thirdly, comparing the absolute antiviral effect of botanicals between studies is challenging because extracts were prepared with different solvents as well as type and amount of plant material. The antiviral activity of a plant is due to its active constituents. Without knowing what these constituents are, their polarity, and which part of the plant they are contained in, it is difficult to determine the ideal method of extraction. As such, plants which have antiviral potential may be found to not possess effects if its extract was prepared with a solvent that was not ideal to extract its active constituents.</p>
