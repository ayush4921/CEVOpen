 </sup> A hydroethanolic extract of the plant’s leaves was prepared and further partitioned into butanol, aqueous residual, butanol residual, and ethyl acetate fractions. The extract and fractions were observed for antiherpetic action against HSV-1 (strain KOS) and HSV-2 (strain 333). The extract and all fractions, except for the aqueous residual fraction, showed antiherpetic activity against both strains, with the strongest inhibitory action observed from the ethyl acetate fraction (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 6.6 μg/ml and SI = 188.7 against HSV-1; IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 7.1 μg/ml and SI = 264.7 against HSV-2). Additionally, the hydroethanolic extract showed strong inhibition toward HSV-2 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 14.1 μg/ml and SI = 171.3) and HSV-1 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 22.2 μg/ml and SI = 68.9). For comparison, acyclovir was also tested and demonstrated an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.5 μg/ml and a SI &gt;2000 against HSV-1 as well as an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 1.2 μg/ml and SI &gt;833.4 against HSV-2. Through other experiments in this study, the authors were able to show that the ethyl acetate fraction can prevent viral attachment and penetration into host cells and can reduce lateral spread of virions.
