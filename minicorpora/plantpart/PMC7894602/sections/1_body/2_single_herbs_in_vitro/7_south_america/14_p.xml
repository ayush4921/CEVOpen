 </sup> Extracts were prepared with methanol, and the methanolic extract was subsequently dried, dissolved in hot water, and lyophilized to create an infusion. Only the methanolic extract and infusion of Juglans australis (methanolic: EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 96.0 μg/ml and SI = 5.9 for HSV-1; infusion: EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 65.3 μg/ml and SI = 8.1 for HSV-1, EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 114.1 μg/ml and SI = 4.3 for HSV-2) and the methanolic extract of Eriobotrya japonica (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 183.2 μg/ml and SI = 2.4 for HSV-1, EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 146.1 μg/ml and SI = 3.0 for HSV-2) were found to be antiherpetic. Only the infusion of J. australis showed effective antiviral activity as defined by the authors as a SI &gt; 8 against HSV-1.
