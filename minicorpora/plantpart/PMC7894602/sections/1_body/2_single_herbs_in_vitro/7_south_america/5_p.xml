 </sup> assessed 10 plants from South America for anti-HSV-1 activity. Aqueous and ethanolic extracts of Baccharis trinervis, Baccharis teindalensis, Eupatorium articulatum, Eupatorium glutinosum, Tagetes pusilla, Neurolaena lobata, Conyza floribunda, Phytolacca bogotensis, Phytolacca rivinoides, and Heisteria acuminata were tested. At concentrations of 50-200 μg/ml, the aqueous B. trinervis extract was able to inhibit 80-100% of viral replication. Two other extracts were observed to inhibit viral replication, but demonstrated cytotoxicity at concentrations that closely paralleled effective concentrations. These extracts were the ethanolic H. acuminata extract and the aqueous E. articulatum extract, which inhibited less than 60% of viral replication at concentrations ranging 125-250 μg/ml.
