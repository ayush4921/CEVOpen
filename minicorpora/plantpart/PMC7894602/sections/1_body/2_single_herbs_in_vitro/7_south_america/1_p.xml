 </sup> observed a chloroform and ethanolic extract from dried leaves and twigs of Cordia salicifolia to have antiviral activity against HSV-1 (strain HF). The ED
 <sub>50</sub> and SI values were found to be 0.85 Î¼g/ml and 261, respectively, when the extract was added post-infection. Time-of-addition experiments showed the extract inhibited viral penetration and replication, but not attachment, and had a direct virucidal effect on HSV-1 virions. A clinically relevant finding was that the extract exhibited 99% inhibition of HSV-1 when added between 3 hours pre-infection to 8 hours post-infection.
