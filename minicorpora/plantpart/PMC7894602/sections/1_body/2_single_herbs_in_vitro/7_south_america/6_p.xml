 </sup> The extract was observed to inhibit &gt;95% viral adsorption when 200 μg/ml was applied during infection, but had no inhibitory effect when applied as a pretreatment to cells. Through the use of radiolabeled virions, it was observed that penetration was reduced by 50% with a concentration of 200 μg/ml of the extract.
