<p>An aqueous extract from Baccharis anomala was studied by Venturi et al.
 <sup>
  <xref rid="bibr50-2515690X20978394" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>
 </sup> for its effect on ATCC-VR733 and 29-R/acyclovir-resistant strains of HSV-1. The aqueous extract demonstrated EC
 <sub>50</sub> and SI values, respectively, of 0.0088 mg/ml and 49.14 against the wild-type strain and 0.065 mg/ml and 66.53 against the 29-R strain. Additionally, pretreatment of cells with the extract did not prevent HSV infection, therefore the extract likely does not act by inhibiting viral attachment.
