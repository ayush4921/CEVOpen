 </sup> made hydroethanolic extracts that were subsequently extracted with dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol using 6 medicinal plants from the Brazilian Atlantic Tropical Forest. The plants studied were Cuphea carthagenensis, Lippia alba, Tillandsia usneoides, Bromelia antiacantha, Araucaria angustifolia, and Wilbrandia ebracteata, and the HSV-1 strains used to test antiviral activity were wild-type strain KOS and 29-R/acyclovir-resistant strain. The most potent extracts were the ethyl acetate extracts of C. carthagenensis (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2 μg/ml and SI = 90) and T. usneoides (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 3 μg/ml and SI = 65) against strain KOS. Other extracts that showed activity against strain KOS were the dichloromethane extracts of C. carthagenensis (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 4 μg/ml and SI = 49) and T. usneoides (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 10 μg/ml and SI = 18), the ethyl acetate extracts of A. angustifolia (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 35 μg/ml and SI = 9) and W. ebracteata (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 62 μg/ml and SI = 4), and the n-butanolic extracts of A. angustifolia (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 13 μg/ml and SI = 11), C. carthagenensis (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 31 μg/ml and SI = 12), T. usneoides (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 3 μg/ml and SI = 8), and W. ebracteata (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 125 μg/ml and SI = 1). The acyclovir-resistant strain was most strongly affected by W. ebracteata, demonstrating EC
 <sub>50</sub> and SI values, respectively, of 25 μg/ml and 10 for the ethyl acetate extract and 12 μg/ml and 10 for the n-butanolic extract. Other extracts that showed activity against strain 29-R/acyclovir-resistant were the n-butanolic extracts of L. alba (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2 μg/ml and SI = 8) and the dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanolic extracts of T. usneoides (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 26 μg/ml and SI = 7, EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 23 μg/ml and SI = 8, EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 12 μg/ml and SI = 2, respectively).
