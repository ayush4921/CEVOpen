<p>The most recent African plant to be investigated for its antiherpetic activity was Thymus capitatus, a Tunisian herb that has a long history of use for purposes such as flavoring food, medicines, cosmetics, and perfumes.

 </sup> prepared aqueous and ethanolic extracts as well as an essential oil from aerial parts of T. capitatus and found all 3 exhibited antiviral effects against both HSV-1 and HSV-2. The EC
 <sub>50</sub> and SI values, respectively, against HSV-1 were 23.4 μg/ml and &gt;12.7 for the aqueous extract, 16.6 μg/ml and 3.5 for the ethanolic extract, and 17.6 μg/ml and 6.0 for the essential oil. The EC
 <sub>50</sub> and SI values, respectively, against HSV-2 were 23.6 μg/ml and &gt;12.6 for the aqueous extract, 2.3 μg/ml and 26.8 for the ethanolic extract, and 18.6 μg/ml and 6.9 for the essential oil. These results highlight that HSV-2 is more susceptible to the ethanolic extract of T. capitatus compared to HSV-1, while both viruses showed similar susceptibility to the aqueous extract and essential oil. This could be due to differences in susceptibility to antiviral compounds between the 2 viruses and the concentrations of these compounds in the different extracts.
