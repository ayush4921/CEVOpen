 </sup> investigated 17 Nigerian medicinal plants for antiherpetic activity in human colonic cancer cells (HT-29 cells). The plants are locally used for indications such as fever, diarrhea, worms, sexually-transmitted infections, enteric conditions, and skin conditions. Ethanolic extracts were prepared of each plant using either the leaves, bark, or whole plant. Extracts were added to cells after HSV-1 adsorption, and authors deemed an extract to have antiviral activity if it inhibited the cytopathologic effect of the virus by 100%. Of the 17 plant extracts, 4 showed anti-HSV activity: Bauhinia thonningii, Anacardium occidentale, Dichrostachys glomerata, and Sterculia setigera. These extracts did not exhibit cytotoxicity to HT-29 cells at a dose of 400 μg/100 μl, and their antiviral effects were noted at a dose of 100 μg/100 µl for each extract.
