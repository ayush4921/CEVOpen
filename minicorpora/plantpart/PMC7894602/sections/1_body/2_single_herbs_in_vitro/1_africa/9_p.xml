 </sup> for their traditional uses for infectious diseases, and 80% aqueous ethanolic extracts of either aerial parts, seeds, or tubers were tested against HSV-1. A total of 5 plants showed antiherpetic activity. Moringa peregrina and Ephedra alata were observed to have the highest antiviral activity at concentration ranges 50-100 μg/ml (Rf 10
 <sup>4</sup>) and 500-1000 μg/ml (Rf 10
 <sup>4</sup>), respectively. Capparis sinaica, Tamarix nilotica, and Cyperus rotundus showed lesser virucidal activity at concentrations of 1000 μg/ml (Rf 10
 <sup>4</sup>), 1000 μg/ml (Rf 10
 <sup>4</sup>), and 500 μg/ml (Rf 10
 <sup>2</sup>), respectively. It must be noted that all 5 plants are edible except for E. alata, therefore it may not be safe to use E. alata for human HSV-1 infections.
