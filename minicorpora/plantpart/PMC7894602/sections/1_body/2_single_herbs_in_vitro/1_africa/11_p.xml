<p>Nauclea latifolia roots were used to make an extraction using a 1:1 mixture of dichloromethane and methanol and tested for anti-HSV-2 activity by Donalisio et al.

 </sup> Two HSV-2 strains were used: an acyclovir-sensitive HSV-2 strain and an acyclovir-resistant HSV-2 strain. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were found to be 7.17 μg/ml and 5.38 μg/ml for the acyclovir-sensitive and acyclovir-resistant HSV-2 strains, respectively. Time-of-addition experiments revealed that the greatest viral inhibition occurred when the extract was added to cells after HSV-2 infection. The authors note N. latifolia does not block viral attachment or entry into host cells. Additionally, the acyclovir-resistant HSV-2 strain was more susceptible to the extract than the acyclovir-sensitive HSV-2 strain, suggesting a potential different mechanism of action than acyclovir.
