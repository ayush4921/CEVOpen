 </sup> found that a steam distillate of aerial parts of H. cordata was effective at inhibiting viral replication (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.0013% and SI &gt;4.4). Neither plaque formation nor viral adsorption were reduced when HeLa cells were pretreated with the distillate. Yet, incubating the distillate with HSV-1 prior to infection prevented viral adsorption, revealing a direct effect on HSV-1 virions as the inhibitory mechanism of action of H. cordata.
