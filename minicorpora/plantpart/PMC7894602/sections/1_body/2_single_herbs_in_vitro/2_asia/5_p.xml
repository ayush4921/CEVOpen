 </sup> tested antiviral activities of 142 extracts against HSV-1 (strain 7401 H). Extracts that showed 100% of plaque inhibition without any visible cytotoxicity at a dose of 100 μg/ml were Elaeocarpus grandiflorus and Woodfordia floribunda. On the other hand, extracts that showed 100% of plaque inhibition without any visible cytotoxicity at a dose of either 300 or 500 μg/ml were Alpinia officinarum, Brainia insignis, Drynaria fortunei, Geum japonicum, Juglans mandshurica, Polygonum cuspidatum, Prunella vulgaris, Rheum palmatum, Spatholobus suberectus, and Terminalia chebula. In the second study, Kurokawa et al.

 </sup> tested antiviral activities of 10 extracts in combination with acyclovir. Acyclovir and extracts were combined at their respective EC
 <sub>50</sub> concentrations and tested against HSV-1 strain 7401 H. The acyclovir-extract combinations that reduced viral plaques to less than 10% of controls were G. japonicum, Rhus javanica, Syzygium aromaticum, and T. chebula. Further experiments revealed that the acyclovir-extract combination elicited stronger antiviral effects than either acyclovir or extract alone, suggesting synergistic activity. No acyclovir-extract combination was more cytotoxic to cells at concentrations lower than the extract alone. Additionally, G. japonicum, R. javanica, S. aromaticum, and T. chebula extracts were tested alone against 2 acyclovir-resistant HSV-1 strains. All 4 extracts were observed to elicit similar antiviral effects on the resistant strains compared to the wild-type strain.
