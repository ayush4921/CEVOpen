<p>In the same year, Yang et al. studied extracts of Phyllanthus urinaria for antiviral effects against HSV-1 (strain KOS) and HSV-2 (strain 196).

 </sup> Extracts were made from whole plant parts and various solvents including acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, ethyl acetate, n-hexane, and methanol. At a dose of 10 μg/ml, moderate HSV-1 plaque inhibition was observed from the acetone (31.4%), ethanolic (40.4%), and methanolic (41.3%) extracts. However, these 3 extracts, at the same dose, inhibited greater than 90% of HSV-2 plaques. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> and SI values, respectively, against HSV-2 were determined to be 4.3 μg/ml and 3.5 for the acetone extract, 5.0 μg/ml and 4.0 for the ethanolic extract, and 4.0 μg/ml and 4.1 for the methanolic extract. For comparison, acyclovir at a dose of 0.05 μg/ml inhibited close to 90% of HSV-1 and HSV-2 plaques. Time-of-addition experiments showed that HSV-2 was suppressed the most when extracts were added to cells just after viral infection and effects were greatly reduced if added pre- or post-viral infection. The authors also tested whether lowering the incubation time or temperature affected the HSV-2 virucidal activity of the 3 extracts and found that it did not affect it significantly.
