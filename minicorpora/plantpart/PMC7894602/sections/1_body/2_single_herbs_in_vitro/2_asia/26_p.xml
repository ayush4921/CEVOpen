 </sup> tested hot aqueous and methanolic extracts of 25 plant species gathered from the island Soqotra in Yemen against HSV-1 (strain KOS). The strongest antiviral effects were noted by the methanolic extracts of Boswellia elongata (SI not reported), Buxus hildebrandtii (SI = 71.4), and Euryops arabicus (SI not reported), each demonstrating an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.35 μg/ml. The methanolic extract of Cissus subaphylla also showed promising anti-HSV-1 activity with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.7 μg/ml (SI not reported). For comparison, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of acyclovir was calculated as 0.7 μg/ml. Experiments were recreated with tenfold higher viral counts, and the extracts of B. elongata and B. hildebrandtii maintained their strong antiviral effects. Other methanolic extracts that showed inhibition of HSV-1 were Boswellia ameero, Cassia socotrana, Cissus hamaderohensis, Commiphora parvifolia, Dracaena cinnabari, Exacum affine, Fagonia luntii. Jatropha unicostate, Kalanchoe farinacea, Pulicaria stephanocarpa, Trichocalyx obovatus, Withania adunensis, and Zygophyllum quatarense with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranging 1.5-25 μg/ml. Additionally, the hot aqueous extracts of Dorstenia socotrana, P. stephanocarpa, and Punica protopunica were active against HSV-1, but were less potent with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 32.1 μg/ml, 50 μg/ml, and 5.8 μg/ml, respectively.
