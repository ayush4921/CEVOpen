 </sup> created aqueous, ethanolic, and methanolic extracts from the freshwater green algae Spirogyra and investigated antiviral activity against HSV-1 (strain F) and HSV-2 (strain G). Firstly, effects were measured when extracts were added to cells before, during, and after viral attachment. All 3 extracts exhibited their strongest antiviral effects when added to cells during attachment, with HSV-1 being more susceptible to the ethanolic extract (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 164.20 μg/ml and SI = 2.17) and HSV-2 to the methanolic extract (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 75.03 μg/ml and SI = 3.34). Moreover, both HSV-1 and HSV-2 virions, when treated with extracts prior to infection, were most strongly inhibited by the methanolic extract. In terms of effects on viral replication, the extracts were able to inhibit HSV yields by 30 hours post-infection. The methanolic extract exhibited the greatest inhibitory effects on HSV-1, and the aqueous extract exhibited the greatest inhibitory effects on HSV-2. When comparing all viral stages tested, the most potent anti-HSV activity was observed during viral attachment.
