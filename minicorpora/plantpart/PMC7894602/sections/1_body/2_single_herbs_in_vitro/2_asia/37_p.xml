 </sup> found an aqueous extract of Epimedium koreanum to inhibit HSV multiplication in both mouse macrophages (RAW264.7) and human embryonic kidney (HEK293 T) cells. The type of HSV virus used in the experiments was not specified. The virus was more susceptible to the extract in mouse macrophages (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.62 μg/ml and SI = 23.5) than in human embryonic kidney cells (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.41 μg/ml and SI = 5.9). At an extract dose of 1 μg/ml, E. koreanum was able to reduce viral titers 2-fold in both RAW264.7 and HEK293 T cells when compared to control.
