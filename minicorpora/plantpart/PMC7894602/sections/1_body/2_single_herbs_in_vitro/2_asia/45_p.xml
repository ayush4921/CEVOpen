 </sup> The extract demonstrated an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.01 μg/ml and a SI of over 40,000 against HSV-2 (strain G ATCC-VR-734), which made it significantly more potent than acyclovir (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 29.04 μg/ml and SI = 12.1). Pretreatment of the virus with the extract showed significant viral inhibition. This effect was attributed to the extract’s ability to inhibit viral attachment and penetration into host cells. Conversely, the extract was less effective when added to cells post-infection.
