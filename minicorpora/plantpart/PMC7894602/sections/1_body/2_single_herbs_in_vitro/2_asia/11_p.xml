 </sup> that used n-hexane, dichloromethane, and methanol as solvents to create extracts that were tested against HSV-1 (strain KOS) and HSV-2 (strain Baylor 186). Extracts of Clinacanthus siamensis, prepared with the same solvents, were concurrently tested for anti-HSV-1 and anti-HSV-2 effects. All extracts exhibited antiviral activity to different degrees. The most potent extract against HSV-1 was the n-hexane extract of C. nutans (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 32.05 μg/ml and SI &gt;50.36) followed by the methanolic extract of C. siamensis (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 37.39 μg/ml and SI &gt;43.52). On the other hand, the most potent extract against HSV-2 was the n-hexane extract of C. siamensis (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 46.52 μg/ml and SI &gt;34.53). For comparison, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values for acyclovir were found to be 0.09 μg/ml for HSV-1 and 0.43 μg/ml for HSV-2.
