 </sup> for antiviral activity against HSV-1 (strain KOS). A hot water extract of the whole plant was prepared and sterilized by 2 methods, filtration and autoclaving. When the extracts were added to cells at the same time of viral inoculation, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> and SI values, respectively, were determined to be 99 µg/ml and 33.4 for the filtered extract and 125 µg/ml and 28.2 for the autoclaved extract. The extracts were less effective when added 2 hours post-inoculation, demonstrating IC
 <sub>50</sub> and SI values, respectively, of 143 µg/ml and 23.1 for the filtered extract and 162 µg/ml and 21.7 for the autoclaved extract.
