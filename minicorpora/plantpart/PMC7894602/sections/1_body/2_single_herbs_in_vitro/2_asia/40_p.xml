 </sup> observed an ethanolic extract of the fungus Antrodia camphorata to have antiviral activity against HSV-1 (strain F) and HSV-2 (strain G). Although not nearly as potent as acyclovir, A. camphorata was found to inhibit viral plaque formation with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 61.2 μg/ml and 57.5 μg/ml for HSV-1 and HSV-2, respectively. In addition, the SI values for the extract were determined as 7.92 for HSV-1 and 8.43 for HSV-2. For comparison, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> and SI values, respectively, for acyclovir were determined as 2.1 μg/ml and 61.9 for HSV-1 and 2.9 μg/ml and 44.8 for HSV-2.
