<p>A hydromethanolic extract of Hemidesmus indicus root was observed to inhibit both HSV-1 and HSV-2 replication to a similar degree.

 </sup> tested antiviral activity when cells were pretreated with the extract, when the extract was added to cells at and post-infection, and when virions were pretreated with the extract. When the extract was added to cells at the time of infection, the EC
 <sub>50</sub> values of the extract were determined as 66.8 μg/ml and 70.6 μg/ml for HSV-1 and HSV-2, respectively. With treatment post-infection, the extract’s EC
 <sub>50</sub> values were determined as 91.3 μg/ml and 86.1 μg/ml for HSV-1 and HSV-2, respectively. No effect on viral replication was observed when cells were pretreated with the extract. Inhibitory effects were markedly stronger when virions were pretreated with the extract. These results indicate that H. indicus is able to inhibit HSV throughout the infection cycle, but effects are more potent pre-infection. Further pre-infection testing revealed the extract specifically inhibits viral attachment. Viral entry is also inhibited by the extract, but only at higher concentrations. Interestingly, the extract’s inhibitory effects were stronger in the second round of infection compared to the first.
