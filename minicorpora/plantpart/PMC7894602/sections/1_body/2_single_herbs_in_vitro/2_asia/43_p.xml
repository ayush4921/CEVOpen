 </sup> prepared several extracts using either the leaves or bark of the plant with water, methanol, ethyl acetate, or chloroform as solvents. Extracts from the bark showed more potent antiviral activity against the regular strain compared to leaf extracts. Most notable were the water (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 9.76 μg/ml and SI = 156.8) and chloroform (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 6.75 μg/ml and SI = 119.9) bark extracts. These extracts were not as strong as acyclovir, which showed an EC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.64 μg/ml and a SI of &gt;468. Against the acyclovir-resistant strain, the water bark extract showed the most potent antiviral activity (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 6.28 μg/ml and SI = 243.6). These values suggest that the water bark extract elicited more potent antiviral effects against acyclovir-resistant HSV-2 compared to a wild-type HSV-2. Further testing revealed inhibition of HSV-2 by the water bark extract occurred by inactivating virions prior to infection while the chloroform bark extract elicited its effect by inhibiting viral attachment and/or entry into cells.
