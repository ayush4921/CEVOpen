<p>The ability of Camellia sinensis, Nerium oleander, and Echium amoenum to prevent HSV-1 (strain KOS) multiplication was explored by Farahani et al.

 </sup> The plants were individually extracted using a decoction method to yield aqueous extracts, and Hep-2 cells were used to test for cytotoxicity. It was observed that N. oleander was toxic to cells at all concentrations and therefore was not used in the antiviral assays. Antiviral activity of the other 2 extracts were measured at 1, 2, and 3 hours post-treatment. Significant antiviral effects of C. sinensis were observed at one (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 20 μg/ml and SI = 50) and 2 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 60 μg/ml and SI = 16.7) hours post-treatment, but activity was decreased by the third hour (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 480 μg/ml and SI = 2.1). E. amoenum was found to be antiviral during the first hour (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 350 μg/ml and SI = 2.9), but less so than C. sinensis. It was concluded that C. sinensis is an effective treatment to inhibit HSV-1 multiplication within 1 hour.
