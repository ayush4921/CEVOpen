 </sup> tested the antiviral effects of Barleria lupulina and Clinacanthus nutans against standard HSV-2 (strain G) and 5 clinical HSV-2 isolates. Methanolic extracts were created from leaves of twigs of B. lupulina and the whole plant of C. nutans. B. lupulina was ineffective at inhibiting plaque formation in cells infected with HSV-2 strain G, but showed antiviral activity against the 5 HSV-2 isolates with EC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranging 442.1-987.7 μg/ml. These doses are significantly below the cytotoxicity value found for the herb (CC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.64 mg/ml). Acyclovir was tested as a control and showed much greater antiviral activity against all HSV-2 strains with EC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranging 1.9-13.6 μM. C. nutans did not exhibit any antiviral activity against plaque formation. In yield reduction assays, cells were treated with the extracts and acyclovir at various concentrations for either 8 or 24 hours. B. lupulina was able to reduce viral titers of all HSV-2 strains to 0.05-12.7% of control yields at 8 hours with doses ranging 0.25-1 mg/ml. C. nutans exhibited antiviral activity only at 24 hours, reducing viral titers to less than 2% of control yields at its highest non-cytotoxic dose (dose not specified). Treatment with 2.5 μM of acyclovir reduced virus titers to 14.2-43.9% of control yields at 8 hours compared to 0.1-5.3% at 24 hours.
