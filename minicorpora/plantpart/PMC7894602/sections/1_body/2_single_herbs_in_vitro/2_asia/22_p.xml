 </sup> E. thymifolia is a widespread herb in Taiwan that is used traditionally for many functions including diuretic, detoxifying, antimalarial, and antidysentery. A negative correlation was observed between the concentration of the extract and the level of HSV-2 multiplication. The ethyl acetate extract was able to substantially decrease HSV-2 infectivity when administered at high concentrations including 2.0, 4.0, and 8.0 Î¼g/ml. Increasing the temperature at which the extract was incubated with the infected cells was not observed to alter inhibitory activity; however, the longer the extract was incubated with the infected cells the more viral inhibition occurred. It was concluded that by inhibiting HSV-2 infectivity, E. thymifolia was able to successfully reduce viral multiplication.
