 </sup> observed an ethanolic extract of Annona muricata and an aqueous extract of Petunia nyctaginiflora, both at 1 mg/ml, to have total cytopathic effect against HSV-1 (strains 753166 and A-16). The stembark of A. muricata and aerial parts of P. nyctaginiflora were used to create ethanolic and aqueous extracts for both herbs. At the noted concentration of 1 mg/ml, no cytotoxicity to Vero cells was noted. The authors conclude that these 2 herbs have the potential to be used as antiherpetic drugs.
