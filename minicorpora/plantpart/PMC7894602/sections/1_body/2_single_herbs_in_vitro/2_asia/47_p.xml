<p>Moreover, a chloroform fraction of an ethanolic extract of Arisaema tortuosum leaves demonstrated antiherpetic activity as investigated by Ritta et al.

 </sup> Initially, cytotoxicity of A. tortuosum leaves and tubers were assessed using separate ethanolic extracts. The ethanolic extract of the leaves was found to be less toxic and was further fractionated with n-hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol. All fractions were found to be highly toxic except for the chloroform fraction, which was assessed for antiviral effects against HSV-1, HSV-2, and an acyclovir-resistant strain of HSV-2. HSV-2 (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.53 μg/ml and SI = 758) and acyclovir-resistant HSV-2 (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.86 μg/ml and SI = 467.4) were more susceptible to the chloroform extract compared to HSV-1 (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.64 μg/ml and SI = 12). The authors note that the chloroform extract was observed to act as a direct virucidal agent as well as inhibit viral attachment, adsorption, and replication.
