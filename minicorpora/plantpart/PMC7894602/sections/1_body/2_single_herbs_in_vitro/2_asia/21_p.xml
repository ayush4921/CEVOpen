 </sup> found potent antiviral activity against HSV-1 from a methanolic extract of Hypericum mysorense (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 100 μg/ml and SI = 1.2), a methanolic extract of Hypericum hookerianum (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 50 μg/ml and SI = 2.4), and an acetone and chloroform extract of Usnea complanta (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 100 μg/ml and SI = 1.2). Virus yield reduction assays revealed H. mysorense and H. hookerianum as the only plant extracts to offer 100% protection from viral particles. Partial anti-HSV activity was noted from an alcoholic and ethyl acetate extract of Melia dubia, a methanolic extract of Cryptostegia grandiflora, and the essential oil of Rosmarinus officinalis. The authors tested a total of 18 plants from Nilgiris, but besides those mentioned, no others exhibited antiherpetic activity.
