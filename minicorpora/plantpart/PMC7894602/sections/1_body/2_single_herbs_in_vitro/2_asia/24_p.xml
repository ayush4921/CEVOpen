 </sup> tested other plants from the genus Phyllanthus, including Phyllanthus urinaria, against HSV-1 and HSV-2. Whole plant aqueous extracts of P. amarus, P. niruri, P. urinaria, and P. watsonii were tested. All extracts inhibited viral replication of both HSV-1 and HSV-2 with IC
 <sub>50</sub> and SI values ranging 11.9-39.5 Î¼g/ml and 12.7 to &gt;33.6, respectively. Of the 4 extracts, P. urinaria demonstrated the highest SI against both viruses (&gt;33.6 for both). It was also found that the extracts exhibited more potent antiviral effects on HSV-1 than HSV-2. Moreover, time-of-addition experiments found that all 4 extracts inhibited viral replication most effectively when introduced to cells at inoculation or post-infection, but not when introduced pre-infection.
