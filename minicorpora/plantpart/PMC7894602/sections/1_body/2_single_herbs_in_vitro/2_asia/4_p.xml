 </sup> Vero and 2 types of human epithelial carcinoma cells (Hep-2 and A549) were used in experiments with an aqueous extract of the plant against wild-type HSV-1 (strain F ATCC-VR733), acyclovir-resistant HSV-1, and HSV-2 (strain G ATCC-VR734). The extract was able to inhibit all 3 HSV strains. The EC
 <sub>50</sub> and SI values, respectively, were determined to be 0.692 mg/ml and 144.51 for wild-type HSV-1, 1.11 mg/ml and 90.09 for acyclovir-resistant HSV-1, and 0.3 mg/ml and 333.33 for HSV-2. It is interesting to note that the EC
 <sub>50</sub> values were similar for the wild-type and acyclovir-resistant strains of HSV-1, suggesting H. cordata elicits antiviral effects through a different mechanism than acyclovir. Tests using Vero cells revealed the extract likely affects HSV virions directly, interfering with viral binding and penetration, blocking viral entry, and suppressing viral replication and gene expression. This multi-stage inhibition was also observed in HEp-2 and A549 cells. Similar to the previous study, the extract was also found to inhibit NF-kB activation. The authors conclude that H. cordata elicits anti-HSV effects through several mechanisms, which makes it a good candidate for treating HSV infections.
