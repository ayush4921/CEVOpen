 </sup> investigated the antiviral effects of M. officinalis essential oil on HSV-1 (strain KOS) and HSV-2 (strain HG). The essential oil was diluted in up to 1% ethanol. Plaque reduction assays revealed that at a concentration of 0.002% oil, there was a 98.8% reduction of HSV-1 and a 97.2% reduction of HSV-2 titres. At higher doses, the viral infectivity was almost completely absent. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> and SI values, respectively, were calculated to be 0.0004% and 7.5 for HSV-1 and 0.00008% and 37.5 for HSV-2. When HSV-1 and HSV-2 were pretreated with M. officinalis oil at its maximum non-cytotoxic concentration (0.002%), viral infectivity was significantly reduced. However, when the treatment was applied to the viruses during viral adsorption, a moderate reduction in plaque formation of 64.8% and 39.9% for HSV-1 and HSV-2, respectively, was seen. Plaque formation was not affected when RC-37 cells were treated with the essential oil prior to or during infection. The essential oil is highly lipophilic, which the authors proposed as a mechanism by which the active constituents in the oil can be used as a direct antiviral for topical use in humans.
