 </sup> pressurized liquid extraction was utilized to create hexane, ethanol, and water extracts with the microalgae Haematococcus pluvialis and Dunaliella salina and evaluated for antiviral activity against HSV-1 (strain KOS). When H. pluvialis extracts were added to virally-infected cells, inhibition of intracellular replication was greatest with the ethanolic extract (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 99.59 µg/ml and SI = 7.39) compared to the hexane (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 189.58 µg/ml and SI = 3.57) and aqueous (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 133.98 µg/ml and SI = 12.01) extracts. D. salina extracts showed slightly weaker activity, with the aqueous extract (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 137.53 µg/ml and SI = 11.48) exhibiting stronger antiviral effects compared to the hexane (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 168.81 µg/ml and SI = 2.88) and ethanolic (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 152.73 µg/ml and SI = 4.07) extracts. Time-of-addition experiments revealed the extracts were more effective when cells were treated before infection compared to addition at the time of infection. The ethanolic extract of H. pluvialis was the most effective, showing an 85% reduction in HSV-1 infectivity at a dose of 75 µg/ml with pretreatment, but a 75% reduction at a dose 150 µg/ml with simultaneous addition. The extracts were also tested for virucidal activity, but all extracts exhibited IC
 <sub>50</sub> values greater than 10 mg/ml, which the authors concluded as having virtually no virucidal activity.
