 </sup> found aqueous extracts and multiple ethanolic extracts (20%, 40%, 60%, and 80%) of Salvia officinalis to be antiviral against HSV-1 (strain KOS) and HSV-2 (strain HG). Extracts were made from S. officinalis specimens from 2 geographic locations: the authors’ garden and the Swabian Mountains. When RC-37 cells were pretreated with the extracts, the greatest HSV-2 plaque reduction was seen with the 20% ethanolic extracts of S. officinalis specimens from the garden (94%) and Swabian Mountains (99%). Effects on HSV-1 were significantly weaker. When virions were pretreated with an extract, viral plaques were reduced by 90% and 99% for HSV-1 and HSV-2, respectively, regardless of the location of origin. Each garden extract as well as the aqueous and 40% ethanolic mountain extracts demonstrated stronger antiviral activity against HSV-2 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.02-3.20 μg/ml and SI = 197-18,345) compared to HSV-1 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.03-11.18 μg/ml and SI = 56-5463). Conversely, the 20%, 60%, and 80% ethanolic mountain extracts had greater effects on HSV-1 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.12-0.48 μg/ml and SI = 1135-3755) compared to HSV-2 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.25-0.64 μg/ml and SI = 865-1802).The authors conclude that the ethanolic extracts were more antiviral than the aqueous extracts, and those made of S. officinalis from the garden had a greater antiviral effect. Therefore, the collection location may play a part in the ability of S. officinalis to act as an antiherpetic treatment.
