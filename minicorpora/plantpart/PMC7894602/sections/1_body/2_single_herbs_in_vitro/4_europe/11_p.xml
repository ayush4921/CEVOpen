 </sup> studied the red algae Polysiphonia denudata for its antiviral effect against 3 HSV-1 strains (KOS, McIntyre, and Kupka) and HSV-2 (strain GC25927). A water extract showed stronger antiherpetic effects against HSV-1 (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.18-0.42 μg/ml and SI = 24.8-47.7) compared to HSV-2 (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.2 μg/ml and SI = 8.7). The antiviral effect differed between the HSV strain and cell type used. For example, the lowest EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.18 mg/ml (SI = 47.7) was observed in Vero cells with the Kupka strain of HSV-1, whereas the highest EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 1.2 mg/ml (SI = 8.7) was observed in E6SM cells with the GC25927 strain of HSV-2. The antiviral effect was dose-dependent and at higher concentrations, specifically an MIC
 <sub>90</sub> of 6.5 mg/ml, the water extract was able to act extracellularly and prevent viral adsorption. Time-of-addition experiments demonstrated that the extract had inhibitory effects when added at viral adsorption or post-infection.
