 </sup> Water and methanolic extracts were prepared of mushrooms Boletus edulis, L. edodes, and Pleurotus ostreatus. Water extracts exhibited greater virucidal activity than methanolic extracts, but overall effects were low. At a concentration of 3.75 mg/ml, HSV-1 (strain KOS) was inhibited by 50%, 25%, and 15% with the water extracts of L. edodes, B. edulis, and P. ostreatus, respectively, while all methanolic extracts showed 50% inhibition at a concentration of 18.75 mg/ml. Time-of-addition experiments showed that when cells were pretreated with the extracts, viral infection was inhibited by all 3 water extracts by approximately 60% and 90% at concentrations of 75 μg/ml and 100 μg/ml, respectively. The methanolic extracts at concentrations of 100 μg/ml inhibited viral infectivity by 40-50%. The water extracts were also more potent at blocking viral adsorption, demonstrating a 60% and 80% reduction in viral infectivity at concentrations of 50 μg/ml and 75 μg/ml, respectively. Lastly, viral replication was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner more strongly by the water extracts. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> and SI values, respectively, for the water extracts were determined to be 27.04 μg/ml and 14.21 for L. edodes, 35.12 μg/ml and 13.96 for B. edulis, and 26.69 μg/ml and 15.15 for P. ostreatus. Although methanolic extracts were less effective at preventing infection of pretreated cells, preventing viral adsorption, and inhibiting viral replication, they were still more effective than control. In terms of mechanism of action. The authors speculate the mushroom extracts block viral attachment or adsorption at initial HSV-1 infection and further inhibit intracellular viral replication.
