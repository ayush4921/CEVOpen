 </sup> studied the ability of aqueous Glycyrrhiza glabra extracts of different pH values to exhibit antiviral activity against HSV-1 (strain F). The neutral water extracts (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 650 to 740 μg/ml and SI = 2.0 to &gt;4.6) showed greater antiviral activity compared to the alkaline extracts (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 600 to &gt;3000 μg/ml and SI = &lt;1 to 3.2). An alkaline extract of Sasa senanensis was used as a positive control as the authors demonstrated its anti-HSV activity in a previous study. S. senanensis out-performed all extracts of G. glabra in the context of preserving cell viability after HSV-1 infection (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.033-0.048 μg/ml and SI = 4.5-11.4). Overall, G. glabra has some potential to act as an antiherpetic treatment, but may not be the most promising botanical available.
