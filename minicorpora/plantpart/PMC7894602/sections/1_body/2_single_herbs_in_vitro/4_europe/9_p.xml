 </sup> investigated the antiviral effects of a hot water extract of M. piperita at different stages of HSV-1 replication. The extract partially prevented HSV-1 infection when host cells were pretreated (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 62.70 mg/ml and SI = 1.79) and partially inhibited HSV-1 adsorption (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 26.65 Î¼g/ml). Addition of the extract after viral adsorption showed viral particles to be completely inactive within 2 hours, and HSV-1 yield was inhibited 30 hours post-infection.
