 </sup> assessed an additional red algae, Ceramium rubrum, for its antiviral effects against HSV-1 (strain Kupka) in Vero cells, and HSV-1 (strain KOS) and HSV-2 (strain GC25927) in E6SM cells. HSV-1 strain KOS was most susceptible to the C. rubrum water extract (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.5 mg/ml and SI = 10.8), showing dose-dependent direct virucidal activity. The extract was less potent against HSV-1 strain Kupka and HSV-2, demonstrating EC
 <sub>50</sub> and SI values, respectively, of 1.1-1.2 mg/ml and 4.9-5.2.
