 </sup> found the essential oil, diluted in ethanol, was able to reduce HSV-1 plaque formation by 82% and HSV-2 plaque formation by 92% when virions were pretreated with 0.01% of the oil for 1 hour. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values for M. piperita against HSV-1 and HSV-2 were calculated as 0.002% and 0.0008%, respectively. When HSV-1 virions were incubated with the essential oil for 3 hours, plaques were reduced by 99%. Time-of-addition experiments revealed the greatest antiviral effects with pretreatment of the viruses with the essential oil and little antiviral activity with pretreatment or post-treatment of host cells. Additionally, pretreatment with the oil, at a concentration of 0.01%, inhibited acyclovir-resistant HSV-1 by 99%. The authors suggest M. piperita elicits antiviral effects by blocking viral adsorption.
