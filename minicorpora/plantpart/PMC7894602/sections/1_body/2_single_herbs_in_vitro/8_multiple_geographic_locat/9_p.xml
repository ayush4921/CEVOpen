 </sup> The plant’s aerial parts and rhizomes were extracted with methanol and aerial part extracts were fractionated with petroleum ether, chloroform, ethyl acetate, butanol, and water. The chloroform fraction was found to be cytotoxic and therefore was not assessed for antiviral capacity. Each extract/fraction was investigated against HSV-1 and HSV-2. The greatest antiviral effects were observed by the petroleum ether (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 69.9 μg/ml and SI = 3.37 for HSV-1; EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 61.16 μg/ml and SI = 3.85 for HSV-2) and ethyl acetate (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 95.7 μg/ml and SI = 2.03 for HSV-1; EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 59.4 μg/ml and SI = 3.27 for HSV-2) fractions and the methanolic rhizome extract (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 295.8 μg/ml and SI = 3.68 for HSV-1; EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 500.0 μg/ml and SI = 2.18 for HSV-2). A strong antiviral effect was observed when petroleum ether or ethyl acetate extracts were added up to 6 hours after initial infection. The methanolic rhizome extract showed viral inhibition when added up to 2 hours after initial infection. Additionally, the ethyl acetate and petroleum ether extracts were able to inhibit &gt;80% viral adsorption when added at concentrations of 50 μg/ml.
