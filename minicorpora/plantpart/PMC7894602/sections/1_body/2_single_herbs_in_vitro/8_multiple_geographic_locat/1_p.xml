 </sup> The mycelia were grown in a culture broth and were found to possess antiviral activity, specifically, a decrease in expression of the HSV-1 antigen after 21 days of cultivation. This activity was maintained when the culture broth was diluted up to 64-fold, and there was no cytotoxicity observed. The authors proceeded to isolate the active compound from this broth and determined it to be a novel nucleoside analogue. This compound was found to have a MIC of 0.72 Âµg/ml against HSV-1.
