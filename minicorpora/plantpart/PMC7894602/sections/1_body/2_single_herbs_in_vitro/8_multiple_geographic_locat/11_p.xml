<p>A total of 31 medicinal plants were extracted with acetone and methanol by Jaeger Greer et al.,

 </sup> and each extract was tested against HSV-1 (McIntyre strain) and HSV-2 (strain 333). Extracts from 8 plants varied in 10-98% inhibition of plaque formation at concentrations ranging 0.025-0.2 mg/ml. These extracts were the acetonic extracts of Atractylis macrophylla, Clematis cirrhosa, Gnaphalium chilense, Hymenoclea salsola, Kalanchoe pinnata, Lithospermum officinale, Psilostrophe cooperi, and Tetraclinis articulata and the methanolic extracts of H. salsola and K. pinnata. The acetonic extract of K. pinnata offered the safest antiviral effect with 95% and 98% inhibition of HSV-1 and HSV-2, respectively, at a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml, without being cytotoxic at this concentration. In subsequent experiments, the acetonic extract of K. pinnata demonstrated an EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.025 mg/ml and SI of 50 for both HSV-1 and HSV-2. Although not as potent, the methanolic extract of K. pinnata demonstrated an EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.05 mg/ml and SI of 19 for HSV-1 and EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.2 mg/ml and SI of 4.75 for HSV-2. Another notable SI was demonstrated by the acetonic extract of A. macrophylla (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.05 mg/ml and SI = 5) against HSV-2.
