 </sup> All tested concentrations of the extract (3.125-400 μg/ml) were non-cytotoxic, and the extract showed a dose-dependent reduction in viral loads. At 400 μg/ml, A. lappa prevented cellular damage from viral infection and showed similar, although slightly better, antiviral capacity to 50 μg/ml of acyclovir.
