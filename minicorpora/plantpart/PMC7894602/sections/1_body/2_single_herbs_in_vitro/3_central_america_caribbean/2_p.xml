 </sup> made the stems and leaves of P. orbicularis into 5 successive extract fractions using the following order of solvents: diethyl ether, chloroform, butanol, 50% ethanol, and an acetic acid/water combination. The butanolic and acetic acid fractions demonstrated significant virucidal activity against acyclovir-sensitive HSV-1 and acyclovir-resistant HSV-1, each in human foreskin fibroblasts and Vero cells. When added to cells at the time of viral infection, the butanolic extract demonstrated EC
 <sub>50</sub> and SI values, respectively, of 30.4-31.3 μg/ml and 21.6-22.8 against acyclovir-sensitive HSV-1 and 32.8-42.5 μg/ml and 15.5-21.8 against acyclovir-resistant HSV-1. The acetic acid extract was not as potent, demonstrating EC
 <sub>50</sub> and SI values, respectively, of 32.5-35.9 μg/ml and 10.3-11.6 against acyclovir-sensitive HSV-1 and 29.4-30.7 μg/ml and 11.3-13.5 against acyclovir-resistant HSV-1. Additionally, extracts were added to virions prior to infection, which showed greater antiviral effects. The acetic acid extract elicited more potent effects against both acyclovir-sensitive HSV-1 (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.47-0.53 μg/ml and SI = 705-785) and acyclovir-resistant HSV-1 (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.40-0.68 μg/ml and SI = 491-1040) compared to the butanolic extract (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.74-1.93 μg/ml and SI = 371-895 for acyclovir-sensitive HSV-1; EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.15-1.51 μg/ml and SI = 474-572 for acyclovir-resistant HSV-1). The authors conclude that the butanolic and acetic acid extracts of P. orbicularis may reduce viral adsorption, attachment, or penetration into host cells. They also conclude that the SI values of these 2 extracts were 10-20 times higher than that of the aqueous extract of P. orbicularis used in the study by del Barrio and Parra.
