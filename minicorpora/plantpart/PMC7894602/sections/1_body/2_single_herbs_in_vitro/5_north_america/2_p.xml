 </sup> made extracts from the roots of 8 different species of Echinacea plants using 70% ethanol and assessed their antiviral activity against HSV-1. Some extracts were further fractionated with n-hexane and/or ethyl acetate. Antiviral assays included exposure to visible and UV-A light to ensure activation of any compounds that may be photosensitizers. The greatest inhibitory activity was elicited by the ethanolic extract of E. pallida var. Sanguinea with a MIC of &lt;0.026 mg/ml and the n-hexane fraction of E. purpurea root with a MIC of 1.56 mg/ml. Additionally, ethanolic extracts of E. atrorubens var atrorubens and E. pallida var angustifolia and the n-hexane fractions of E. pallida var. angustifolia, E. pallida var. pallida, and E. pallida var. tennesseensis each had an MIC of &lt;1 mg/ml.
