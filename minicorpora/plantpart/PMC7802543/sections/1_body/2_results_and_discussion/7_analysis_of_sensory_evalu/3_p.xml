<p>Azizkhani and Parsaeimehr (
 <xref rid="fsn31984-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>) worked on probiotic survival, antioxidant activity, and sensory properties of yogurt flavored with herbal (peppermint, basil, and zataria) essential oils and concluded that peppermint and basil samples showed both good antiradical activity and sensory acceptability. In the sensory tests, yogurt samples were evaluated for appearance, flavor, texture, and overall acceptability. The mean scores for the appearance of basil and peppermint treated yogurt were higher than the control yogurt. The mean scores for the appearance of probiotic yogurt with basil and peppermint were within the acceptable range, but there was no significant difference between the types of yogurt (
