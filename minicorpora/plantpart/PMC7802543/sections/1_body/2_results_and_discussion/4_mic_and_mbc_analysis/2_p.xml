<p>The results of the MIC and MBC tests are given in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn31984-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>, indicating that the FAEO had a greater effect on the bacteria and that a lower concentration was required to inhibit the growth of the bacteria. For MIC of FAEO, the concentrations of 160 μg/ml for 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and 640 μg/ml for 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>L. bulgaricus</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. thermophiles</italic> were required; for MBC, the concentrations of 320 μg/ml for 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, and 1,280 μg/ml for 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>L. bulgaricus</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. thermophiles</italic> were required. For MIC of the 
 <italic>F. angulate</italic> extract, the concentration of 1,280 μg/ml, and for MBC, the concentration of 2,560 μg/ml were required.
