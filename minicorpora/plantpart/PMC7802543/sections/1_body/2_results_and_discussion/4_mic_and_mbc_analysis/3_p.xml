<p>The results of the nongrowth zone diameter and MBC and MIC of FAEO and FAEE on pathogenic bacteria and yogurt starters showed that the antibacterial effect of essential oil is greater than the extract. Also, Gram‐positive bacteria were less resistant to extracts and essential oils. This is due to the structural difference in the wall of Gram‐positive bacteria compared to Gram‐negative ones; the Gram‐positive bacteria in their cell wall have a mucopeptide composition, while Gram‐negative bacteria have only a thin layer of mucopeptide, and most of the building wall in them is lipoprotein and lipopolysaccharide; therefore, Gram‐negative bacteria are more resistant. As a result, the higher resistance of Gram‐negative bacteria can be attributed to the presence of almost nonpermeable exogenous phospholipid membranes (Tabatabaei Yazdi et al.,
