<p>In all probiotic yogurts containing essential oils and extracts of the 
 <italic>F. angulata</italic> plant, the viscosity increased compared to the control treatment. The addition of FAEO was more effective in increasing viscosity compared to FAEE (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). There was no significant difference in the viscosity of probiotic yogurts containing 0.2% and 0.4% 
 <italic>F. angulata</italic> (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). The treatment containing 0.01% of essential oil had the highest viscosity on the first and 21st days (0.51 ± 0.02 pa.s &amp; 0.37 ± 0.07 pa.s). Over time, viscosity was significantly reduced in all probiotic yogurts containing the extracts and essential oils of
