<p>In this study, the viscosity of the product increased with the addition of essential oil and extract. Similarly, Kim et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31984-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>) concluded that viscosity improved when LL (lotus leaf) powder was added to the yogurts (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). An at least 4‐fold higher viscosity was observed in LL yogurts than in the control during storage. Polyphenols can bind to proteins and form protein–polyphenol complexes. The abundant phenolic compounds in LL interacted with milk proteins such as casein in the yogurt matrix, resulting in higher viscosity than that in the control.
