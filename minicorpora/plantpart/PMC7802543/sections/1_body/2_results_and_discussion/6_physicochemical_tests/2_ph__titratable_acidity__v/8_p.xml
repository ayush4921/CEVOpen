<p>According to Ashrafi yourghanloo and Gheybi (
 <xref rid="fsn31984-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>), increasing the denaturation of whey proteins improves water retention capacity and thus reduces dehydration. The tendency to hydrate is a function of the concentration of whey proteins. By increasing the ratio of whey proteins along with the reduction in casein micelles, the main factor in gel formation, dehydration (syneresis) increases. They also reported that by adding 5% and 10% of dill extract to yogurt, the amount of syneresis decreases and increases, respectively, compared to the control sample.
