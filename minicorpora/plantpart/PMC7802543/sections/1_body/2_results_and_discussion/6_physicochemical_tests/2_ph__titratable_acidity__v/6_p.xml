<p>Adding plant extracts to probiotic yogurt leads to a significant increase in acidity compared to the control sample, which is because fermenting yogurt with plant extracts increases the metabolic activity of yogurt bacteria and acidity due to the production of organic acids of lactic acid bacteria. In addition, over time, the acidity of all treatments increases significantly, which is due to the increase in storage time and the continuation of the process of lactose fermentation by the starter and probiotic bacteria, increasing acidity due to the accumulation of acids such as lactic acid and formic acid (Ghalemousiani et al.,
