<p>According to the results of Hosseini Shirazi et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31984-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>), based on Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31984-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, the widest peak belongs to the N‐H stretching groups, and the peak in the 1,500 range belongs to the C = O and C‐N stretching groups and the N‐H bending group. The range of 1,000 belongs to the C = O, C–N, and N–H bending groups. By comparing the control yogurt with other herbal yogurts, one can conclude that the use of this amount of essential oil and extract does not change the structure of proteins.
