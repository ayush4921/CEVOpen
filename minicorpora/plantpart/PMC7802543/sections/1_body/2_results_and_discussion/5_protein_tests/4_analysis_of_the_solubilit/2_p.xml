<p>Table 
 <xref rid="fsn31984-tbl-0005" ref-type="table">5</xref> presents the results of the solubility and WAC of yogurt protein. There is a significant difference in the protein solubility and the percentage of WAC of different treatments of probiotic yogurts containing the extract and essential oil of 
 <italic>F. angulata</italic> (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). The solubility of the protein in probiotic yogurts containing FAEO was significantly higher than that of probiotic yogurts containing the extract (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Compared to the control treatment, adding FAEE (0.2% and 0.4%) to probiotic yogurts significantly reduced protein solubility, while in probiotic yogurts containing FAEO (0.01% and 0.03%), it significantly increased protein solubility compared to the control treatment (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). The lowest and highest protein solubility belonged to probiotic yogurts containing 0.2% FAEE (0.34 ± 0.04) and those containing 0.03% FAEO (0.58 ± 0.03).
