<p>Brückner‐Gühmann et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31984-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>) in their research on enrichment of yoghurt with oat protein fractions: Structure formation, textural properties, and sensory evaluation explained generally, and three factors affect the compatibility of proteins: (a) different solubility in the solvent, (b) different molecular weight, and (c) differences in the conformation. Protein solubility of both oat protein concentrate (OPC) and oat protein isolate (OPI) is pH dependent. At pH 7, which is close to the pH of milk, solubility of OPC and OPI was found to be around 30%.
