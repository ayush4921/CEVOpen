<p>Results in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn31984-tbl-0004" ref-type="table">4</xref> showed that in all probiotic yogurts containing FAEE, the amount of phenolic compounds was lower than that of probiotic yogurts containing FAEO. In herbal probiotic yogurts, with increasing the extract concentration from 0.2 to 0.4, the amount of phenol increased (
