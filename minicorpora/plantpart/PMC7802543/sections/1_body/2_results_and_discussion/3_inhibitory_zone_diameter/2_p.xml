<p>The results in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn31984-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref> show that the inhibitory zone diameter of FAEO on 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, 
 <italic>L. bulgaricus</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. thermophilus</italic> bacteria was significantly greater than that of FAEE (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05). In 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, there was no significant difference in the antibacterial effect of the extract and the essential oil of 
 <italic>F. angulata</italic> (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). As for 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, the antibacterial effect of FAEO was equal to that of tetracycline (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), and in other bacteria, the growth inhibition diameter in tetracycline was greater than that of FAEE and FAEO (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Most of the antimicrobial effect of FAEE was reported on 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (12 ± 0.50), FAEO on 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (20 ± 0.80), and tetracycline, as the control, on 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (24 ± 0.58).
