 <xref rid="fsn31984-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>) examined the effect of FAEO on the growth of 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> during the production and maintenance of Iranian white cheese, and their results showed that the highest inhibitory effect was for 0.03% and 0.015% of essential oils. The results of the evaluation of pH changes during sample storage showed the effect of essential oil concentration on pH variation, such that this amount decreased with increasing the essential oil concentration.
