 <italic>L. acidophilus</italic> in the probiotic yogurt containing the extract and essential oil of the 
 <italic>F. angulata</italic> plant was significantly higher than in the control treatment (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). The highest survival rate of 
 <italic>L. acidophilus</italic> was measured on the first and 7th days in probiotic yogurts containing 0.1%, and on the 14th and 21st days in probiotic yogurts containing 0.03%, respectively. In general, 
 <italic>L. acidophilus</italic> decreased in all treatments over time. In the treatment of the plant probiotic control and yogurt containing 0.2 FAEE, the percentage of survival changes on the 14th and 21st days was not significant (Table
