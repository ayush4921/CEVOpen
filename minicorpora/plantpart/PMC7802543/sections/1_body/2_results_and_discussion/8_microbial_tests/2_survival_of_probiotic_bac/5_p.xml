<p>Marhamatizadeh et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31984-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>) investigated the effect of olive leaf extract on the growth and survival of 
 <italic>L. acidophilus</italic> and 
 <italic>B. bifidum</italic> in milk and probiotic yogurt over 21 days in the refrigerator and achieved similar results. In this study, olive leaf extract at the concentrations of 2%, 4%, and 6% was added to the samples. The results showed that the number of 
 <italic>L. acidophilus</italic> and 
 <italic>B. bifidum</italic> in samples containing olive leaf extract is significantly higher than the control sample. There was also a positive relationship between bacterial growth and increased concentration of the olive leaf extract.
