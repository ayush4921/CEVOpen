<p>The survival of 
 <italic>B. bifidum</italic> in probiotic yogurts containing the extracts and essential oils of the 
 <italic>F. angulata</italic> plant was significantly higher than the control treatment (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). On the first, 7th, and 21st days, the highest survival of 
 <italic>B. bifidum</italic> was measured in probiotic yogurts containing 0.03% of FAEO and on the 14th day in probiotic yogurts containing 0.4% of FAEE. In general, in all treatments, the survival time of the bacterium 
 <italic>B. bifidum</italic> decreased, and the lowest life expectancy was measured on the 21st day and the highest life expectancy on the first day (Table
