<p>Also, Ghalemousiani et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31984-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>) found that the addition of plant extracts to probiotic yogurt containing 
 <italic>Lactobacillus paracasei</italic> significantly increases the survival of probiotic bacteria compared to the control yogurt (probiotic yogurt without extract) due to the phenolic compounds in plant extracts. These have been shown to play a stimulating role in improving the growth of yogurt starter and probiotic bacteria. It was also noted that as the amount of dissolved oxygen in the product environment decreases, the bioavailability of probiotics increases. Moreover, phenolic compounds improve the growth of probiotic bacteria in the absence of oxygen.
