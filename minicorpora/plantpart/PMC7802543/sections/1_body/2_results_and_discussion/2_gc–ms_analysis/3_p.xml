<p>In the study by Rezazade et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31984-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>), 
 <italic>F. angulata</italic> volatile oil, which had been dried in the shade, was extracted by the water vapor distillation method and examined by a chromatographic gas device connected to a mass spectrometer detector, and its components were identified. In this work, 33 compounds that constituted 89.7% of the components were identified, of which 77.1% were monoterpenes and 12.6% were sesquiterpenes. The main identified compounds were alpha‐pinene, bornyl acetate, and cis‐ocimene, which were almost consistent with this study.
