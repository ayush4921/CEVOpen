<p>Azarbani et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31984-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>) also investigated the phytochemicals, phenolic profiles, antioxidant, and antibacterial activities of 
 <italic>Ferulago macrocarpa</italic> extracts from Lorestan (Iran) and observed that the volatile fraction of the leaves' extract comprised 48 constituents accounting for 94.91% of the total volatile amount. The main identified compounds were bornyl acetate (37.91%), o‐cymene (7.83%), 2‐hexanal (7.01%), camphene (5.57%), and α‐pinene (3.64%). The antibacterial activity of this plant may be attributed to the presence of terpinolene, thymol, and α‐pinene.
