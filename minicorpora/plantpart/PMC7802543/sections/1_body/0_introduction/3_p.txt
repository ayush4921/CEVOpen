3: Nevertheless, during the storage of probiotic products, the survivability of these bacteria shows a decreasing trend due to several factors, for example, the low pH of fermented foods, hydrogen peroxide produced by some  lactobacilli, and high oxygen content (Kim et al.,  2019; Sarvari et al.,  2014).
