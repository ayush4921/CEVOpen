<p>The probiotic yogurt, having probiotic effects, is a product with adjuvant microorganisms. There are numerous advantages associated with consuming fermented dairy products containing probiotic bacteria (Aswal et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31984-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). However, to deliver their health benefits, probiotics must be present in food products above a threshold level (&gt;6 log cfu/g) at the time of consumption in order to survive the passage through the upper and lower parts of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (Marinaki et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31984-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Nevertheless, during the storage of probiotic products, the survivability of these bacteria shows a decreasing trend due to several factors, for example, the low pH of fermented foods, hydrogen peroxide produced by some 
 <italic>lactobacilli</italic>, and high oxygen content (Kim et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31984-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>; Sarvari et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31984-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). The most commonly used probiotic supplements contain the species of

 <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> and are part of the healthy human intestinal microbiota (Nashaat AL‐Saadi,
