<p>Combining probiotics with herbal products may provide further antimicrobial‐therapeutic properties. However, as herbs are antimicrobials, they may affect the viability of probiotic microorganisms. In vitro studies testing herbs on the growth of selected probiotics demonstrated that herbal products significantly enhance the growth of probiotics while inhibiting pathogens (Be et al.,

Also, the use of herbal extracts can exert a strong effect on food properties, including structural, functional, and nutritional changes in proteins. Several factors can influence the action and reaction of phenolic compounds, most notably pH, protein type and concentration, and the structure of phenolic compounds. (Ozdal et al.,

One way to enhance the viability of probiotic bacteria is the addition of medicinal plants to dairy products which, while increasing the viability of these bacteria and the shelf life of these products, does not adversely affect the organoleptic properties of the products.
