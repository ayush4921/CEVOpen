 <xref rid="fsn31984-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>) is a native plant in some parts of Iran (Sodeifian et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31984-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). The genus 
 <italic>Ferulago</italic> belongs to the Apiaceae family and is used in folk medicine for sedative, tonic, digestive, and antiparasitic effects (Taran et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31984-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). There have been some published reports on its significant antibacterial, antioxidant, and antidiabetic properties, and, traditionally, it was added to dairy and oil ghee to prevent decay as a strong preservative and to increase the shelf life of dairy products besides adding a pleasant taste to them (Alizadeh et al.,
