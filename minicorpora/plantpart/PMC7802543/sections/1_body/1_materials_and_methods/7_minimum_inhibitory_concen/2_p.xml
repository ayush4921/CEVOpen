<p>The MIC and MBC test of FAEE and FAEO was determined by the tube dilution method described by Tabatabaei Yazdi et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31984-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>) with some modifications. The bacterial suspensions were prepared the same as the disk diffusion test. Briefly, the bacterial dilation was prepared in nine sterile tubes. Eight tubes were used for serial dilution and one for control. All the bacteria were incubated at 37°C for 48 hr. After incubation, the tubes were examined for turbidity caused by the growth of inoculated microorganisms. All tubes with no growth were sampled and cultured to determine MBC. The tubes containing the lowest concentrations of FAEE and FAEO and in which no growth was observed in the relevant plate were considered as MBC (Tabatabaei Yazdi et al.,
