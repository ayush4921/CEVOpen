<p>The antibacterial activity of the samples was evaluated against

 <xref rid="fsn31984-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). For this purpose, the agar diffusion method was used. The bacteria were cultured for 24 hr on the Mueller Hinton agar, and a suspension was prepared in 0.5 McFarland dilution (OD
 <sub>625 nm</sub> = 0.1) in the Mueller Hinton broth. Then, 5 ml of each bacterial suspension was cultured with the spread plate method using a sterile swap, and blank disks containing 2,560 μg/ml of each EE/EO diluted with DMSO were placed on the culture medium. Subsequently, the inhibitory zone diameter was measured after 24 hr of incubation at 37°C. A tetracycline disk was used as the control disk (Moghtader et al.,
