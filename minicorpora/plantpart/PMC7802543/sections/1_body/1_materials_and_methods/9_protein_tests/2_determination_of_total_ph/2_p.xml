<p>The TPC was determined by Folin–Ciocalteu reagent. Briefly, 1 ml of the yogurt extract (a mixture of 10 gr of yogurt samples with 2.5 ml of distilled water) was mixed with 1 ml of 95% ethanol, 5 ml of distilled water, and 0.5 ml of the Folin–Ciocalteu reagent, and the contents of the tube were mixed thoroughly. Then, 1 ml of 1N 50% Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> was added, and the sample was incubated in the dark for 120 min at room temperature. Finally, the absorbance was measured at 725 nm with a spectrometer (T80UV/VIS Spectrometer, PG Instruments LTD; Ashrafi yourghanloo &amp; Gheybi,
