<p>The method used by Brückner‐Gühmann et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31984-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>) with some modifications was adopted to analyze the solubility of yogurt protein samples. The yogurt samples were suspended at a concentration of 5% (w/w) in distilled water by magnetic stirring at room temperature for 1 hr. The pH was adjusted as required to pH 4 with 1N HCl. The suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min, and the protein content in the supernatant, as well as in the suspension before centrifugation, was determined according to the Kjeldahl method. The relation of the protein content in the suspension to the protein content in the suspension before centrifugation yields the protein solubility (Brückner‐Gühmann et al.,
