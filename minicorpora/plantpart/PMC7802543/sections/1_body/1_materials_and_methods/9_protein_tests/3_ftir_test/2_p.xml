<p>Infrared (IR) or Fourier‐transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy has a large application range, from the analysis of small molecules or molecular complexes to the analysis of cells or tissues. It has also been increasingly applied to the study of proteins. This concerns the analysis of protein conformation, protein folding, and molecular details from protein active sites during enzyme reactions using reaction‐induced FTIR difference spectroscopy (Berthomieu &amp; Hienerwadel, 
 <xref rid="fsn31984-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). Herein, a Bruker Tensor 27 FTIR spectrometer equipped with a KBr beam splitter and DLaTGC detector was utilized. The samples were placed onto a silicon sample carrier and left to dry in ambient air for 30 min prior to data collection.
