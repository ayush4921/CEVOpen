<p>The water absorption capacity (WAC) of yogurt protein was determined using the protocol described by Rodríguez‐Ambriz, Martínez‐Ayala, Millán and Davila‐Ortiz (
 <xref rid="fsn31984-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>). The WAC (%) of the sample is calculated using by dividing the weight of the water absorbed by the weight of the protein sample (Al‐Shamsi et al.,
