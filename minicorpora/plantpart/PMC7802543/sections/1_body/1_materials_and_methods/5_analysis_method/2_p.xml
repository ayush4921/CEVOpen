<p>To analyze the components of FAEE and FAEO, a gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890A) coupled with mass spectrometry (Agilent 5975 C) GC/MS (HP‐5MS) equipped with a column (30 m in length, with an internal diameter of 0.25 mm and a thin layer thickness of 0.25 µm) was employed. The temperature profile was as follows: At first, the temperature of the oven was fixed on 45°C for 1 min and then increased to 300°C with a temperature rate of 5°C/min. The helium input flow rate was 1 ml/L (Sodeifian et al.,

The extract constituents were identified by the comparison of their retention indices relative to (C7‐C20) n‐alkanes and by comparison of their mass spectra with those of the internal reference mass spectra library (NIST and Wiley). The percentage of volatile compositions was calculated from the GC peak areas (Azarbani et al.,
