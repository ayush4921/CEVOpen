<p>The results demonstrated that there is a significant difference in the amount of TPC, protein solubility, and WPC of different probiotic yogurt treatments containing the extract and essential oil of 
 <italic>F. angulata</italic> (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). There was also a significant difference in the acidity, viscosity, and syneresis of samples containing the extract and essential oil of 
 <italic>F. angulata</italic> (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, 
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05, and 
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; .01, respectively). Therefore, the addition of FAEE and FAEO significantly increased the TPC, acidity, viscosity, and protein solubility of the samples. pH changes in different treatments over time were not significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05).
