<p id="Par65">Light is vital for plant growth and development; it provides energy for photosynthesis, but also affects overall plant growth and development through the regulation of endogenous plant hormones [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Studies in Arabidopsis have reported that a retrograde signaling is associated with the redox and hormonal pathways. The study demonstrated that AP2/ERFs show a quick upregulation in plants moved from dark to light. However, this response is for a very short time and in full sunlight conditions, the expression is reduced subsequently. Therefore, when the immediate response is finished for the transition from dark to light, under regular sunlight, the expression of these TFs should decrease. The downregulation of AP2/ERFs in higher light intensities as compared to the lower light intensities suggests that a similar response exists in 
 <italic>Asarum</italic> leaves (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. However, we noticed that one AP2/ERF (
 <italic>Cluster-24,085.2657</italic>) was upregulated in full compared to 50% sunlight conditions. This was quite different from overall TFs of the same family and needs further specific investigation. The histidine-containing phosphotransfer protein which was upregulated under higher light conditions as compared to lower light conditions is implicated in cytokinin pathway where it plays an important role in cell division and shoot initiation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Thus, this gene might be increasing the biomass through increasing cell division and should be studied further. Concerning this observation, the downregulation of xyloglucan:xyloglucosyl transferase TCH4s is interesting because cell wall modifications are needed for cell division [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Therefore, enzymes involved in xyloglucan modification may affect cell wall characteristics and, ultimately, cell shape and plant form [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Under low light conditions, plants experience increased auxin biosynthesis and transport as well as auxin sensitivity are enhanced [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. That means, when sufficient light is available for normal growth of the plant, it should do the reverse. In our transcriptome data of low light and full sunlight conditions, the downregulation of auxin responsive SAUR genes suggests that 
 <italic>Asarum</italic> leaves, when grow under low light conditions, increase auxin sensitivity by upregulating these genes and when the light is sufficient (full sunlight conditions), auxin sensitivity is no more needed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Following the above statement that the auxin sensitivity is not needed under full sunlight conditions, the downregulation of AUX/IAAs (Auxin/indole-3-acetic acid) further confirms this adaptation in 
 <italic>Asarum</italic> leaves [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>].
