<p id="Par64">Because a moderate reduction in antenna size results in increased photosynthesis and resultantly higher biomass accumulation, so the observation of different genes related to biomass accumulation under full sunlight conditions in 
 <italic>Asarum</italic> was expected. In this regard, the downregulation of L-ascrobate oxidases in full sunlight conditions could be important because it is previously known that high light intensity induces higher ascorbate levels in the leaves. It could be possibly due to low ascorbate mutation and needs further specific investigation. Nevertheless, It is documented that ascorbate mediates regulation of plant growth and plays important role in biomass accumulation in plants [

The upregulation of phosphoenylpryrovate carboxykinase (ATP) in full sunlight is quite interesting because it is reported that this enzyme is less active during the day time largely by dephosphorylation of the enzyme, which makes it less sensitive to stimulatory metabolites and more sensitive to inhibitory metabolites, such as malate. So further studies on this gene and its regulation in day time will be needed to understand its function in 
 <italic>Asarum</italic> leaves [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Apart from these adaptations, plants also use various strategies to assimilate carbohydrates in vegetative organs. In this regard, one important strategy is to stay-green. This was recently discovered in maize where maize plants stay green for a longer time [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Furthermore, it is known that stay-green proteins regulate chlorophyll degradation in dark-induced senescence [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The upregulation of two stay-green genes in full sunlight conditions suggests that 
 <italic>Asarum</italic> leaves, when provided with full sunlight, tend to accumulate higher biomass.
