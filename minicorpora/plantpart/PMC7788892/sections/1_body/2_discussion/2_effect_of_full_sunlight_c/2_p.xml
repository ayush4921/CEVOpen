<p id="Par63">Carotenoids play essential role in photosynthesis and photoprotection and studies have demonstrated that carotenoid biosynthesis is regulated by light [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Transcriptome comparison showed the upregulation of a β-carotene 3-hydroxylase in full sunlight conditions which converts α-carotene to zeinoxanthin, which is finally converted into O-lutein. It also directly converts α-carotene to O-lutein with the help of another enzyme LUT1 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. It is the most abundant carotenoid and the only ligand for site L1 in light-harvesting complex proteins. The upregulation of this gene might be the increasing demand to quench the antenna complex in 
 <italic>Asarum</italic> leaves under full sunlight conditions similar to previous report in Arabidopsis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. In addition to this, the downregulation of one gene controlling the final step in the xanthoxin formation in full sunlight versus 12% sunlight conditions might also be the part of 
 <italic>Asarum</italic> leaves’ photoprotective strategy under full sunlight conditions (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>; Additional Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>; Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). So, the transcriptomic observations under full sunlight conditions related to antenna proteins as well as carotenoids suggest that 
 <italic>Asarum</italic> leaves develop a photoprotective strategy under excess light conditions.
