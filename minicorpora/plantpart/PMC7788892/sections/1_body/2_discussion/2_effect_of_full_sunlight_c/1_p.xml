 <italic>Asarum</italic> being a sciophyte grows in shady environment and there have been some studies which tried to address the effect of full sunlight on photosynthesis and related parameters. Our study also discusses the transcriptional changes within 
 <italic>Asarum</italic> leaves related to photosynthesis and biomass accumulation. It is known that higher plants’ chloroplasts convert light into biological energy by employing electron transport chain and Calvin-Benson cycle. This process uses genes and proteins of both nuclear and chloroplast origins and their expression is highly dynamic and is primarily influenced by light [

 <italic>Asarum</italic> leaves were grown under full sunlight conditions, the photosynthesis-antenna proteins were downregulated as compared to the studied low light treatments i.e. 50, 28, and 12% light conditions (Additional Tables

 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Previous research on photosynthesis has shown that photosynthetic electron transport rates are light saturated at approximately 1/4th of full sunlight intensity. This is due to large optical cross section of light harvesting antenna complexes that capture photons relatively faster (~ 10-fold faster) than the rate-limiting step in electron transport. Therefore, this downregulation of several antenna proteins in full sunlight conditions as compared to low light intensities is possibly due to this phenomenon.
