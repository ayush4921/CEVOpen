<p id="Par49">The cDNA libraries constructed from light treated 
 <italic>A. heterotropoides</italic> leaves were sequenced with Illumina HiseqTM high-throughput sequencing platform. After filtering low quality reads and adapter sequences, a total of 97.33 Gb clean data was obtained consisting of Illumina reads ranging from 41,987,144 to 65,408,518 million/sample (average 54,067,052) (Additional Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Trinity assembly tool was used to de novo assemble the transcriptome. After data processing, 106,982 unigene sequences were included, and the N50 was 1375â€‰bp long. The summary of the unigene sequence size ranges is shown in Additional Fig.
