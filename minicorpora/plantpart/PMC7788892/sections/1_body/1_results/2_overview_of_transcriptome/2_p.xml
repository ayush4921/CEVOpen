<p id="Par50">Functional annotation of all unigenes as blasted the non-redundant (NR) (38.47%), Nucleotide (NT) (19.48%), Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) (15.7%), Swiss-Port (27.24%), Pfam (28.96%), Gene Ontology (GO) (28.96%), Ortholog Groups (KOG) (9.13%) databases is presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a; a total of 106,982 unigenes was annotated. The Fragments Per Kilobase of Transcript per Million Fragments Mapped (FPKM) gene expression levels in the four treatments are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b. Pearson correlations between replicates of the four irradiation treatments in 
 <italic>Asarum</italic> leaves ranged from 0.771 to 0.858 (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). Differential expressed genes (DEGs) expressed under different treatment comparisons are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b and Additional Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>. Graphical representation of the KEGG enrichment scatter plot of DEGs between different treatment comparisons is shown in Additional Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">3</xref>. We used the Richfactor, Q-value, and number of genes enriched in specific pathways to show the degree of KEGG enrichment. The KEGG pathway enrichment showed that the most common significantly enriched pathways under the tested conditions were phenylpropanoid pathway, plant hormone signaling-transduction, photosynthesis-antenna proteins, protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, and flavonoid metabolism (Additional Fig.
