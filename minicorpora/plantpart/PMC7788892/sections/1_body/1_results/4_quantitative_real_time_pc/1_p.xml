<p id="Par60">We validated the expression profiles of ten 
 <italic>Asarum</italic> genes (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The selection of the genes was random to achieve the objective of this analysis i.e. validation of the expression results observed in transcriptome analysis. The 
 <italic>Actin</italic> gene was used as the internal control to standardize the data. Among the tested genes, five were upregulated and five were downregulated in full sunlight conditions as compared to low light conditions. The results of the qRT-PCR showed similar expression patterns as recorded in the transcriptome analysis confirming the reliability of our RNA-Seq data.
