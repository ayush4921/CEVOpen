<p id="Par59">Our comparative transcriptome data showed the upregulation of only one TF i.e. AP2/ERF-ERF (
 <italic>Cluster-24,085.2657</italic>) in full sunlight grown 
 <italic>Asarum</italic> leaves as compared to 50% light grown leaves. By comparing the full sunlight and 28% light conditions, three TFs i.e. two AP2/ERF-ERFs (
 <italic>Cluster-24,085.12486</italic> and 
 <italic>Cluster-24,085.17619</italic>) and one WRKY (
 <italic>Cluster-24,085.14452</italic>) were downregulated while, one WRKY, one MYB, one, TAZ, and one OFP were upregulated. The AP2/EFF-ERF TF (
 <italic>Cluster-24,085.12486</italic>) was also downregulated in full to 28%, full to 12, 50 to 28%, and 50 to 12% sunlight conditions. Similarly, the WRKY TF (
 <italic>Cluster-24,085.14452</italic>) was also downregulated in 50 to 12% light conditions. Eight AP2/ERF-ERFs, one AP2/ERF-RAV, one C2H2, one MBF1, and one NAC were downregulated between 50 and 28% light conditions while only one bHLH was upregulated. A relatively larger number of TFs belonging to 24 families were differentially regulated. Finally, the transcriptome comparison between 28 and 12% light conditions showed the downregulation of TFs belonging to AP2/ERF-EFF, C2C2-DOF, HSF, ZF-HD, and MYB-related gene families (Additional Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>). Interestingly, full sunlight comparisons with the three low light intensities resulted in the upregulation of some TFs while the comparisons between the low light conditions did not show upregulation of TFs except one bHLH (in 50 to 28% and 50 to 12%) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>).
