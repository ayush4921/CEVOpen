<p id="Par51">Previous studies have demonstrated that the volatile oil content is affected by light/shade conditions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Therefore, we searched for the DEGs associated with volatile oil biosynthesis in our comparative transcriptome data between different light treated 
 <italic>Asarum</italic> leaves. Between the full sunlight and 50% light conditions, a gene (
 <italic>Cluster-24,085.27155</italic>) was upregulated in 
 <italic>Asarum</italic> leaves. This gene is annotated as CAD and the KEGG pathway mapping suggested its involvement in controlling the important steps in the formation of caffeyl-alchol and coniferyl alcohol, which are intermediates in the formation of methyleugenol (Additional Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). The upregulation suggested full sunlight conditions have a beneficial impact on the biosynthesis of methyleugenol through the upregulation of CAD gene. Two other genes involved in the same pathway i.e. the final steps of methyleugenol biosynthesis were also upregulated in full sunlight grown 
 <italic>Asarum</italic> leaves as compared to 28% light conditions. One of the two genes was annotated as CAD (
 <italic>Cluster-24,085.41570</italic>) while the second gene was annotated as peroxidase 25-like (
 <italic>Cluster-24,085.21345</italic>) (Additional Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). This second gene is involved in the final step of lignin formation. Another gene (
 <italic>Cluster-24,085.10149</italic>) was upregulated in 
 <italic>Asarum</italic> leaves grown in 50% light conditions when compared with 28% light conditions. This gene is involved in the formation of phenyl-ethylamine, which is an important intermediate of phenylpropanoid pathway (Additional Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>; Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).
