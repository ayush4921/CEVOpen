<p id="Par55">Carbon fixation is an important process in photosynthetic organisms, which affects carbon acquisition and biomass allocation. Light intensity has been reported to be an important factor in this regard [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. We found that carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms was one of the significantly enriched pathways under the studied light conditions (Additional Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">3</xref>). The upregulation of a phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (ATP) gene (
 <italic>Cluster-17,798.0</italic>) in full sunlight grown leaves as compared to those grown in 50% sunlight conditions was consistent with the findings of a previous study in soybean [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Three genes annotated as ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase small chain were also differentially regulated under low-light intensities i.e. 
 <italic>Cluster-20,520.0</italic> in 50 to 28%, 
 <italic>Cluster-23,656.0</italic> in 50 to 28% and 28 to 12%, and 
 <italic>Cluster-164.0</italic> in 50 to 28% and 28 to 12% light conditions (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). However, these three genes did not differentially express under full sunlight conditions.
