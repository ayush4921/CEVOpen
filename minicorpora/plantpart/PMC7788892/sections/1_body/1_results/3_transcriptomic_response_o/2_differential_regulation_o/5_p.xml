 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Several genes involved in this pathway such as UDP-glycosyltransferase 76F1-like, Glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase, 1,4-alpha-glucan-branching enzyme, and Î²-amylase 3, chloroplastic-like, were upregulated in higher light intensities. Some genes such as alpha,alpha-trehalose-phosphate synthase, UDP-glucuronate 4-epimerase 6, UDP-glucuronate decarboxylase, and growth-regulating factor 1-like were downregulated in high light intensity to low intensity. Only one of these four genes (alpha,alpha-trehalose-phosphate synthase) was differentially regulated in full sunlight conditions while the other three were differentially regulated between 50 to 12% light conditions (Table
