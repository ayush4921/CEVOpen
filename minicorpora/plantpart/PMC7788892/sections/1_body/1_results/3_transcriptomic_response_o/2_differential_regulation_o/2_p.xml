<p id="Par53">We searched our transcriptome for DEGs related to the carotenoid pathway and found one gene (
 <italic>Cluster-9588.0</italic>) that was upregulated under full sunlight conditions as compared to 50% as well as 12% light conditions. Additionally, we found two more unigenes (
 <italic>Cluster-24,085.17524</italic> and 
 <italic>Cluster-24,085.21006</italic>) that were actually downregulated under full sunlight conditions as compared to 12% light. These genes are involved in the abscisic acid biosynthesis part of the carotenoid biosynthesis where the first gene controls the final step of xanthoxin formation while the second gene converts abscisate to dihydroxy-phaseic acid (Table
