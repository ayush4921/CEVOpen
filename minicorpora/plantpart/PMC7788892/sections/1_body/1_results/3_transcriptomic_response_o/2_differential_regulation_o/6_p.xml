<p id="Par57">The processes of photosynthesis and biomass accumulation are affected by several pathways. Therefore, we searched for DEGs that have been reported in this regard. Stay-green genes regulate chlorophyll degradation during dark-induced senescence [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. We noticed that one gene predicted as Stay-green protein (
 <italic>Cluster-24,085.51159</italic>) was upregulated in 
 <italic>Asarum</italic> leaves grown under full sunlight grown leaves as compared to those grown in 50 and 12% light. Another predicted Stay-green gene (
 <italic>Cluster-24,085.56669</italic>) was upregulated between full to 12% sunlight conditions (Additional Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>; Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Among other DEGs, we observed differential regulation of ATP-dependent DNA helicase Q-like genes, cytochrome P450, oxaloacetate decarboxylase, ZINC INDUCED FACILITATOR-LIKE 1-like genes, subtilisin-like proteases, BURP domain protein RD22, protein trichome birefringence-like 38, and receptor-like protein kinases [
