<p id="Par54">Our results demonstrated that ascorbate and aldarate metabolism was a significantly enriched pathway under the studied light conditions. Therefore, we searched for DEGs related to this pathway and found that two genes annotated as L-ascorbate oxidase were downregulated in plants grown under full sunlight conditions (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The first gene (
 <italic>Cluster-24,085.74455</italic>) was downregulated in 
 <italic>Asarum</italic> leaves grown under full to 50%, full to 12, 50 to 12%, and 28 to 12% sunlight conditions. This gene controls the conversion of L-ascorbate to L-dehydro ascorbate. The second gene (
 <italic>Cluster-24,085.74454</italic>) was the only differentially expressed gene between full to 12% sunlight conditions and plays the same role as the first gene (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>; Additional Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). A UDP-glycosyltransferase 76F1-like gene (
 <italic>Cluster-24,085.63483</italic>) was upregulated in full sunlight grown 
 <italic>Asarum</italic> leaves as compared to the ones grown under 50% light conditions. This gene converts UDP-D-glucuronate to D-glucuronate [
