<p id="Par52">As it is previously established that morphological, physiological, and biochemical changes occur in plants grown under sunlight versus shade conditions and the process of photosynthesis is affected [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], we searched for genes in our transcriptome that are associated directly or indirectly with photosynthesis. An important gene (
 <italic>Cluster-24,085.63483</italic>) implicated in porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism pathway was upregulated (log2foldchange = 3.2) under full sunlight grown 
 <italic>Asarum</italic> leaves as compared to 50% light conditions (Additional Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>; Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). One photosynthesis-antenna protein related to light-harvesting complexes (
 <italic>Cluster-24,085.41612</italic>, Lhcb1) was downregulated in full sunlight conditions as compared to 50% light. This gene was also differentially expressed between full sunlight versus very low light intensity (12%) conditions (Additional Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). The downregulation under full sunlight conditions compared to both 50 and 12% light intensities suggests that under the influence of increased light intensity, 
 <italic>Asarum</italic> optimizes their light-harvesting antenna. Because there are several photosynthesis-antenna proteins, we searched our DEGs for other antenna proteins and found the downregulation of one antenna protein (
 <italic>Cluster-24,085.76692</italic>, Lhcb2) in full sunlight versus 28% light conditions. Interestingly, five antenna proteins were downregulated in full versus 12% sunlight grown 
 <italic>Asarum</italic> leaves (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). These results further confirmed the fact that like other plants, 
 <italic>Asarum</italic> leaves manipulate antenna proteins to control the light capture rate under natural full sunlight conditions.
