<p id="Par58">We searched for DEGs related to hormone signaling pathways [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. A gene (
 <italic>Cluster-24,085.2657</italic>) related to ethylene responsive factor in plant hormone signal transduction pathway was upregulated in full sunlight grown 
 <italic>Asarum</italic> leaves as compared to 50% light treated leaves (Additional Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). A histidine-containing phosphotransfer protein (
 <italic>Cluster-24,085.34259</italic>) was also upregulated in these light conditions. This gene was also upregulated in treatment in low light treatment comparisons i.e. 50 to 12% and 28 to 12% light conditions (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). On the other hand, we noticed the downregulation of two auxin responsive SAUR proteins (
 <italic>Cluster-24,085.21051</italic> and 
 <italic>Cluster-19,269.0</italic>) and three xyloglucan:xyloglucosyl transferase TCH4s (
 <italic>Cluster-24,085.68791</italic>, 
 <italic>Cluster-24,085.68790</italic>, and 
 <italic>Cluster-24,085.18269</italic>) in full sunlight grown 
 <italic>Asarum</italic> leaves as compared to those grown in 12% light conditions (Additional Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>; Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Both auxin responsive SAUR genes were also downregulated in 
 <italic>Asarum</italic> leaves grown under 50% sunlight as compared to 12% sunlight conditions (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>; Additional Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). A similar pattern was observed for the expression of xyloglucan:xyloglucosyl transferase TCH4s. We noticed that a relatively higher number of genes were differentially expressed between 50 and 12% sunlight conditions as compared to full sunlight versus other three light conditions. Those genes were annotated as auxin-responsive protein IAA4, protein phosphatase 2C 37-like, TF MYC2, auxin-responsive protein IAA4, auxin early response protein SAUR41, auxin-responsive protein IAA25, and jasmonate ZIM domain-containing protein (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>; Additional Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>).
