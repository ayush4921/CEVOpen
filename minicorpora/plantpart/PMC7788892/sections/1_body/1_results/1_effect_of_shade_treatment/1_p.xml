 <italic>Asarum</italic> plants were grown under four light irradiances including, full sunlight (L1), 50% sunlight (L2), 28% sunlight (L3), and 12% sunlight (L4). Because leaf is the plant organ, where light is directly absorbed and the main photosynthate is produced and processed, therefore, we focused on the essential oil changes and transcriptional responses as adopted in a previous studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The percent yield of four important 
 <italic>Asarum</italic> volatile oil components under various light treatments are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. The oil component with the highest percentage among the four major volatile oil constituents was methyleugenol followed by safrole, toluene, and myristicin. Metyleugenol content was highest under full sunlight conditions and decreased with the decrease in the light intensity while it did not differ significantly between 28 and 12% light conditions. Myristicin showed an almost similar pattern where the highest content was recorded in full sunlight grown leaves and it decreased with the reduction in the light intensity. It decreased 9.75, 8.58, and 7.6 fold when treated with 50, 28, and 12% light, respectively. Safrole content also showed a reducing pattern with the decrease in the light intensity where the highest content was 21.4% in full sunlight conditions followed by 19.21, 15.26, and 14.70% when leaves were grown under 50, 28, and 12% sunlight conditions, respectively. The toluene percent content in full and 50% sunlight light grown leaves did not differ significantly while a further reduction in sunlight intensity (28% light) resulted in 12.8 fold decrease. Under low light conditions i.e. 28 and 12% light, the toluene content did not change significantly, however, a reducing trend was still noticeable (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Together these observations suggest that 
 <italic>Asarum</italic> leaves grown under higher light conditions result in volatile oil higher enriched in the four compounds.
