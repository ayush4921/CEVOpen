 <italic>Asarum</italic> [
 <italic>A. heterotropoides</italic> Fr. Schmidt var. 
 <italic>mandshuricum</italic> (Maxim.) Kitag.] cultivar zhongnong xixin-1 was used as plant material in this study. For plant material, no voucher has been deposited in a genebank. The formal identification of the plant materials was undertaken by the corresponding author of this article (Zhiqing Wang). The plants were originally collected from the wild in June 2018 and kept at the Medicinal Herbs Garden of Jilin Agricultural University. No permissions are necessary to collect such samples. In October 2019, we transplanted ~ 250 four-years old dormant seedlings into 30 cm diameter and 40 cm tall pots filled with humus (pH = 6.28). All pots were then placed at Medicinal Herbs Garden of Jilin Agricultural University (43.80′N, 125.42′E) under normal growing condition. In the next year, soon after the leaves appeared (second week of May 2019), we subjected the plants to different light treatments for 21 days; it is the time when 
 <italic>A. heterotropoides</italic> leaves expand and it is known that the diurnal net photosynthetic rate increases when grown under variable light conditions [

Treatments consisted of full sunlight (L1), 50% sunlight; one layer of black nylon net providing 50% shade (L2), 28% sunlight; two layers of nylon net each providing ~ 50% shade (L3), and 12% sunlight; three layers of black nylon net each providing ~ 12% shade (L4), and were conducted in net houses (Fig.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Average day length for the experimental period was 15 ± 1.5 h. Each treatment involved 24 pots with three replications and each pot contained 4–5 plants. For each replication, 6–8 leaves were randomly collected for volatile oil constituent analyses. For RNA extraction the 3–4 randomly selected leaves were harvested from each treatment, washed and stored immediately at − 80 °C. We used only leaves which were free from worms or any pathogen.
