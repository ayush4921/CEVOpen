<p id="Par68">After treatment, the leaves were harvested, cleaned, and placed in the shade with good ventilation. The dried leaves were ground into powder and subjected to hydrodistillation for 6 h. 10 μL of volatile oil was drawn from the solution and diluted 50 times using petroleum ether. 1 μL of this diluted sample was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. A HP-5MS highly polar capillary column (30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.25 μm, Hewlett-Packart, Palo Alto, CA, USA) coated with a 100% polyethylene glycol stationary phase was used. The following oven temperatures and times were used: 40 °C (held for 2 min), raised from 40 °C to 160 °C at a rate of 2.5 °C/min, from 160 °C to 280 °C at a rate of 8 °C/min, finally, held at 280 °C for 10 min. The injection temperature was set at 280 °C. Helium was used as the carrier gas with a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. An injection volume of 1 μL was used with a split ratio of 100:1. The mass spectrometer was operated under a mode of electron impact (EI) at 70 eV with the scan ranges were between 30 and 550 amu. The ion source temperature was maintained at 230 °C and the quadrupole at 150 °C. Compound identification was done by comparing the NIST library data of the peaks with those reported in literature, and mass spectra was compared with peaks from literature data. Percentage composition was computed from GC peak areas on with DB-5 ms column without applying correction factors.</p>
