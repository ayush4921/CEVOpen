<p id="Par66">In this study, high-throughput sequencing of 
 <italic>Asarum</italic> transcriptome was performed under different light conditions. In-depth transcriptome analysis allowed us to identify the expression levels of key genes involved in the volatile oil biosynthesis. Specifically, we targeted genes involved in the biosynthesis of four major volatile oil components i.e. methyleugeol, safrol, myristicin, and toluene biosynthesis. The variation of the major genes in addition to the biochemical data of the four components demonstrated that high light conditions enrich 
 <italic>Asarum</italic> volatile oil with these four components. We further studied the expression of genes related to photosynthesis under full sunlight conditions, which revealed complexity of gene expression in the studied sciophyte. We also found the expression of hormone-signaling pathway related genes in the light of previous studies. Our transcriptome data represent the first genomic resource of 
 <italic>Asarum</italic> under different light conditions and lays the foundation for further research aiming at enriching important bioactive metabolites in medicinal plants using genetics, genomics, and biotechnology methods. We conclude that full sunlight conditions help 
 <italic>Asarum</italic> to increase volatile oil biosynthesis. The light intensity under full sunlight conditions is managed by the regulation of antenna proteins and 
 <italic>Asarum</italic> leaves accumulate biomass when grown in full sunlight. Based on these conclusions, it could be recommended that 
 <italic>A. heterotropoides</italic> can be grown in full sunlight conditions for increased biomass and volatile oil biosynthesis.
