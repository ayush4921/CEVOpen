 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and it is known that the biomass accumulation is associated with the rate of photosynthesis in plants. Therefore, it is essential to understand the regulation of genes involved in plant biomass accumulation and photosynthetic efficiency in 
 <italic>Asarum</italic> together with the impact of irradiance on volatile oil components [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In plants, photosynthesis is a complex, multistep process involving electron transport chain, Calvin-Benson cycle, and subsequent steps involving assimilation, transport, and utilization of photoassimilates. These distinct yet overlapping processes require the product of hundreds of proteins and genes associated either with the nucleus or chloroplasts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Similarly, biomass accumulation in plants is a complex process involving photosynthetic pathways, cell architecture, plant growth regulators, sugar transport and accumulation, metabolism, and regulation of transcription [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Since both processes involve a high number of genes and pathways, studying them in an individual genetic characterization project or working with a single pathway is not possible and demands large-scale transcriptome analyses. Recent developments in transcriptomics have enabled the understanding of complex pathways in medicinal plants including

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The low light irradiance levels lead plant leaves to adapt in shade conditions through various mechanisms involving photosynthetic machinery, adjustment in cell growth, stomatal conductance, and hormone-signaling [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Therefore, a transcriptome will enable the understanding of the differential changes in the expression of genes involved in these pathways.
