0: Methyleugenol is a common phenylpropanoid found in many medicinal plant species.
1: It is derived from eugenol that is a product of phenylalanine through the reaction of cinnamic acid, ferulic acid, coniferyl alcohol, and coniferyl acetate.
2: Methyleugenol is further converted into myristicin [ 14 17].
3: Several reports have identified and characterized this pathway-related genes e.g.
4: coniferyl alcohol acyl transferase (CAAT) in apple fruit, eugenol synthase genes (EGS) in rose, Ocimum, and Gymnadenia, genes encoding O-methyltransferases (OMT) in loquat, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) in Arabidopsis and many other plant species [ 18 24].
5: Another important constituent of the volatile oil in  Asarum is safrole.
6: It has been suggested that it is possibly biosynthesized from eugenol through the formation of the methylenedioxy bridge and shares a common precursor coniferyl alcohol [ 25].
7: Apart from methyleugenol, myristicin, and safrole, toluene (3,5-dimethoxytoluene) is another major component of volatile oil in many aromatic medicinal plants including  Asarum species.
8: In roses, a number of OMT genes have been identified to convert orcinol to 3-methoxyl-5-hydroxytoluene, and then to toluene [ 26,  27].
9: Because, these four components are the main components in the  Asarum volatile oil, it is important to understand their possible regulation under different light intensities.
