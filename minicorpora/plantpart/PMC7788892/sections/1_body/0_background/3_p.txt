0: The amount of solar radiation directly impacts on the photosynthetic characteristics of  Asarum [ 6] and it is known that the biomass accumulation is associated with the rate of photosynthesis in plants.
1: Therefore, it is essential to understand the regulation of genes involved in plant biomass accumulation and photosynthetic efficiency in  Asarum together with the impact of irradiance on volatile oil components [ 28].
2: In plants, photosynthesis is a complex, multistep process involving electron transport chain, Calvin-Benson cycle, and subsequent steps involving assimilation, transport, and utilization of photoassimilates.
3: These distinct yet overlapping processes require the product of hundreds of proteins and genes associated either with the nucleus or chloroplasts [ 29].
4: Similarly, biomass accumulation in plants is a complex process involving photosynthetic pathways, cell architecture, plant growth regulators, sugar transport and accumulation, metabolism, and regulation of transcription [ 30].
5: Since both processes involve a high number of genes and pathways, studying them in an individual genetic characterization project or working with a single pathway is not possible and demands large-scale transcriptome analyses.
6: Recent developments in transcriptomics have enabled the understanding of complex pathways in medicinal plants including  Asarum [ 25,  31 33].
7: The low light irradiance levels lead plant leaves to adapt in shade conditions through various mechanisms involving photosynthetic machinery, adjustment in cell growth, stomatal conductance, and hormone-signaling [ 13,  34 36].
8: Therefore, a transcriptome will enable the understanding of the differential changes in the expression of genes involved in these pathways.
