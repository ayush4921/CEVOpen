<p id="Par47">Efforts have been made to optimize the extraction of volatile oil from this medicinally important plant [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The possible ways to increase the volatile oil production are 1) to understand the effect of different light intensities on the photosynthate and in turn on the volatile oil biosynthesis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], 2) understand the volatile oil and its componentsâ€™ biosynthesis-related pathways, and based on this knowledge, 3) develop high volatile oil yielding 
 <italic>A. heterotropoides</italic> genotypes for large scale extraction. In this study, transcriptome sequencing of 
 <italic>Asarum</italic> leaves grown under four different light treatments was performed to uncover the effect of light treatments on genes involved in pathways associated with the biosynthesis of methyleugenol, myristicin, safrole, and 3,5-dimethoxytoluene. Furthermore, we also studied the effect of light on the genes related to photosynthesis, which in turn influence biomass accumulation under different light irradiances. Additionally, we also explored the differential regulation of plant hormone signaling related genes.
