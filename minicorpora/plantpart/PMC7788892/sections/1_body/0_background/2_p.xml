<p id="Par45">Methyleugenol is a common phenylpropanoid found in many medicinal plant species. It is derived from eugenol that is a product of phenylalanine through the reaction of cinnamic acid, ferulic acid, coniferyl alcohol, and coniferyl acetate. Methyleugenol is further converted into myristicin [

Several reports have identified and characterized this pathway-related genes e.g. coniferyl alcohol acyl transferase (CAAT) in apple fruit, eugenol synthase genes (EGS) in rose, Ocimum, and Gymnadenia, genes encoding O-methyltransferases (OMT) in loquat, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) in Arabidopsis and many other plant species [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Another important constituent of the volatile oil in 
 <italic>Asarum</italic> is safrole. It has been suggested that it is possibly biosynthesized from eugenol through the formation of the methylenedioxy bridge and shares a common precursor coniferyl alcohol [

 <italic>Asarum</italic> species. In roses, a number of OMT genes have been identified to convert orcinol to 3-methoxyl-5-hydroxytoluene, and then to toluene [

 <italic>Asarum</italic> volatile oil, it is important to understand their possible regulation under different light intensities.
