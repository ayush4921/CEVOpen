<p id="Par29">The combined effect of EO and conventional antibiotics (streptomycin, ciprofloxacin) on antimicrobial activity has been studied by the checkerboard microdilution test as described by [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] with few modifications. This assay was performed in a 96-well plate using two-fold serial dilutions. Conventional antibiotics were diluted vertically, whereas EO was diluted horizontally so that each well should contain different concentrations of two compounds. The starting concentration of each compound was the MIC. Following this, 50 μL suspension containing 4 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells of test bacteria was pippetted to each well. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h and visually inspected for growth [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The lowest concentration of combination (EOs and antibiotics), which did not contain any visually detectable bacterial growth was considered as MIC. Besides, the control (containing test bacteria but no EOs/antibiotics) was used to assess the growth of bacteria, while the negative control was taken to assess the clarity/turbidity in the CKEO/combination. Each test was performed in replicates. The checkerboard generates many effective combinations (the first clear well of each row of the microtiter plate containing antimicrobial agents), and the fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) was calculated [
