<p id="Par24">GC/MS analysis was carried out on a Varian GC/MS 4000 coupled with gas chromatograph 3800 fitted with a Varian factor four VF-5 ms fused silica capillary column. Its dimension were 30 m × 0.25 mm id, film thickness 0.25 μm. Temperature of the oven was set at 60 °C, which was programmed to rise to 250 °C at the rate of 5 °C/min. Helium was used as carrier gas. Its flow rate was set at 1 mL/min. Mass spectra were recorded with E.I. at 70 eV. Range of mass spectra was chosen 50–300 amu at the speed of one scan per second.</p>
