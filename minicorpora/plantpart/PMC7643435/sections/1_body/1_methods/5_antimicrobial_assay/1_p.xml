<p id="Par28">The antimicrobial activity of the EOs was determined using the microdilution assay method [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Briefly, each bacterial culture was aseptically inoculated in nutrient broth (HiMedia Biosciences) and grown overnight at 37 °C with shaking (200 rpm). The suspension was diluted to 1.5 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> colony forming units (CFU/ mL) equivalent to 0.5 McFarland standard turbidity based on optical density (0.132) at the wavelength of 600 nm and finally adjusted to give approximately 1.5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/mL for each organism. Fresh stock solution of CKEO (10 mg/mL) was prepared using DMSO. Different dilutions (10–100 μg/mL) were prepared from the stock solution of CKEO and different antibiotics (1 mg/mL in sterile distilled water). Antibiotics such as streptomycin, amphotericin B were used as positive controls. Different dilutions of CKEO and antibiotics (150 μL) were mixed with the nutrient broth containing 4 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> CFU bacteria (50 μL). Appropriate negative (1% DMSO) and blank controls (un-inoculated media) were used. Microtiter plates (96 wells) were incubated at 37 °C for 12–16 h. The concentration, which killed 99.9% of the pathogen, was considered as the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), while the concentration, preventing the visible growth of bacteria under defined growth conditions, was considered as the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) [
