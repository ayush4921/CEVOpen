<p id="Par37">The antimicrobial activities of CKEO and geraniol were examined against various pathogens using microdilution assay. Results in terms of both the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) are given in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. CKEO inhibited the growth of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> with MIC and MBC 20 μg/mL. It has also inhibited the growth of 
 <italic>B. subtilis, S. enterica typhimurium, S. aureus, K. pneumoniae</italic> with MICs 25–50 μg/mL. The CKEO was also found active against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> and inhibited the growth with MIC 100 μg/mL. These results suggested that CKEO had broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
