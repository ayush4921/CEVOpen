0: Nevertheless, as a reflection on the long tradition concerning the management of many plants, a non-negligible amount of them is still used, and may have an important significance at a local level.
1: In the Catalan linguistic area (CLA, i.e., the Catalan-speaking regions) studied in this paper the knowledge on WFP has had great importance during the Spanish civil war, World War II, and the years after these wars, as a subsistence or famine food, as also in other places [ 3], then their use decreased.
2: Similarly, preserved popular knowledge about food plants was useful for subsistence during the siege of Sarajevo and elsewhere in Bosnia and Herzegovina during the war, between 1992 and 1995 [ 4, 5].
3: Indeed, when the Soviet Union broke up, and Cuba experienced economic difficulties, losing Soviet contributions, traditional agricultural practices regained prominence [ 6] and ethnobotanical knowledge regarding cultivated and wild plants served to organise food plant supply and significantly alleviated the effect of the crisis [ 7].
4: In any case, WFP were also known, appreciated and used before these periods, and the traditional knowledge, which was cumulated not only in emergency episodes, persisted, thus allowing the current use of some taxa even further than at local level [ 8, 9].
5: In industrialised areas, a couple of generations ago WFP were associated with difficult periods, and acculturation processes have occurred but this has not prevented the continued use of various WFP (e.g., in different places [ 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]).
