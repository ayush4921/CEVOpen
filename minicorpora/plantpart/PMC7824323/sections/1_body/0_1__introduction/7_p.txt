0: In accordance with the reasons stated in the last paragraph, the aim of this paper is to present a meta-analysis of a significant part of the WFP dataset of the Catalan-speaking territories, inventorying the plants and the information associated with them, and identifying the most relevant ones.
1: With this work we intend (a) to build a catalogue of Catalan-culture WFP, as in other ethnic groups often underestimated and underutilised, (b) to analyse data recorded from different points of view in order to pave the way for a meta-analysis on this subject that could help to envisage a further comparative study at higher levels (European, Mediterranean), (c) to identify, according to the ethnobotanical information, the WFP that could have the added value of being considered as nutraceuticals, and (d) to indicate, suggest or propose old, in some cases forgotten traditional foods that could be newly introduced onto the market, first -but not only- locally, or that could be of interest for new agronomic and commercial possibilities.
