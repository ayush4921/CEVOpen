0: The heritage of ethnobotanical knowledge about food plants, and particularly that of wild plants, semi-domesticated taxa or minor, underutilised or neglected crops is of great relevance in food security and sovereignty, comprising both the right of any person to a sufficient and healthy nutrition and the right of peoples to culturally adequate food [ 22, 23, 24, 25].
1: Indeed, food and raw materials have been considered important for food security in different areas of the world, and WFP are important within these raw materials [ 26].
2: Ethnoculinary approaches, influencing researchers from different fields in tracing connections between populations often living in different geographic regions, also importantly deal with WFP [ 27].
3: WFP are also taken into account in the ever more relevant concept of ecosystem services, as a survival value of cultural ecosystem services, basic for livelihood [ 28].
4: In addition, WFP are important as ancestors or relatives of cultivated, including major crop, plants [ 29], and as a reservoir of genes not present in domesticated taxa or races that could be useful for new crop developments [ 30].
5: Irrespective of their relevance, WFP have been the object of cultural erosion [ 31] and face conservation problems [ 32], this making their study and possible protection plans (comprising both plants and associated traditional knowledge) highly desirable.
