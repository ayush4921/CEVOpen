<p>Ethnobotany of WFP has been intensively addressed in all continents with a permanent population since the classical times of modern ethnobotanical research (e.g., among numerous papers [

 <xref rid="B43-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and references therein), and much of this information is collected in a database of our research group. This database currently contains information of 3039 informants and 1778 plant taxa. This represents a total of 118,537 use reports (UR), of which 69,170 (58.35%) correspond to medicinal uses, 31,415 (26.50%) to food (including beverages) uses, and 17,952 (15.15%) to other uses. Several ethnofloristic or review papers focused on food plants have been published from this cultural area [
