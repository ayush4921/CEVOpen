<p>Out of the 278 WFP taxa recorded in this paper, 218 (78.42%) appear in the PFAF database as edible. Some of these WFP are considered with a high edibility rating, such as 
 <italic>Rumex acetosa</italic>, whereas some others, such as 
 <italic>Cytinus hypocistis</italic> have attributed a low edibility rating. This means that most WFP employed in the CLA are more or less common and well known as edible. Nonetheless, a non-negligible pool of plants, more than one fifth of the total, does not appear in this database. Some of them are widely distributed and for sure used in other regions, such as 
 <italic>Apium nodiflorum</italic> (L.) Lag. subsp. 
 <italic>nodiflorum</italic>, but some others are rarer.
