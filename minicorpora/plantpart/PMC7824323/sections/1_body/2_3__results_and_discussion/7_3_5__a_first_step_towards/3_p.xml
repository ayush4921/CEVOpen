<p>A number of the 60 taxa (21.58%) not present in the PFAF database are importantly reported in the CLA and, although they are not endemic, most of them are not so common elsewhere. We provide here a few examples of different territories. 
 <italic>Molopospermum peloponnesiacum</italic> (L.) Koch, 
 <italic>Saxifraga aquatica</italic> Lap. and 
 <italic>Taraxacum dissectum</italic> are common in the Pyrenees and actively searched during a specific time of the year. In inland, dry territories 
 <italic>Pyrus spinosa</italic> constitutes a similar case, as well as 
 <italic>Thymbra capitata</italic> (L.) Cav. in the Balearic Islands and 
 <italic>Thymus piperella</italic> in the south Valencian area. A much more in-depth revision, including almost all European literature should be undertaken in order to definitely establish a pool of WFP particularly representative of the CLA, but now a not inconsiderable first approach is done.
