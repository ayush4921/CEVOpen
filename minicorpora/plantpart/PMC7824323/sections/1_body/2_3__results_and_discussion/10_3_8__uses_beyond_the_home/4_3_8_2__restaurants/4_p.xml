<p>There are more case examples, and there could in fact be many more. We here explain just one that we have never seen in a market nor in a restaurant, but that we are convinced could be highly appreciated: 
 <italic>Chenopodium bonus-henricus</italic>. During eight years (2004â€“2011), the senior author of this paper was the co-responsible person for a subject for undergraduate pharmacy and biology students on useful plants of the Catalan Pyrenees, mostly based on field work. Every year, within the framework of this subject, he cooked an omelette with the leaves of this plant, which he proposed the students to taste. In all cases not one of these young people had eaten this plant, but unanimously expressed their appreciation of the omelette, for many of them better than the classical one of another plant from the same Amaranthaceae family, 
 <italic>Spinacia oleracea</italic>. In the Italian Alps, the species is used in a similar way to its use in the Catalan linguistic area [

 <italic>Chenopodium</italic> species, but not this one, appear as interesting Mediterranean WFP [
 <xref rid="B17-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Research on the food composition of this species would surely result in possibilities of its utilisation on a larger scale than nowadays.
