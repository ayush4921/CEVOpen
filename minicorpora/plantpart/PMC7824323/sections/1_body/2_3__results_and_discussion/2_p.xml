<p>The number of WFP recorded can be considered high, when it is compared with those reported from other zones, which in most cases comprise drinks apart from foods, which are the only products considered in this paper: Spain (419; [
 <xref rid="B73-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]), several areas of Greece, Italy and Spain (318 in total, 147, 84 and 173 in each country; [

 <xref rid="B80-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]). We quoted here works dealing with socioeconomically and geographically different areas, including the one our studied zone belongs to. We are aware that the number of plants used may depend on the number of plants of the local flora and on the sampling effort in each case; this is why we considered works from quite different places, to show variability and give at least an approximate idea. In a review of 64 Mediterranean and neighbouring areas, the biogeographical region, which our studied area belongs to, Rivera et al. [
 <xref rid="B81-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>] recorded between 14 and 565 (mean 133.11) wild food taxa, including fungi and considering drinks, again raising the number of taxa recorded in this paper to a high level.
