<p>Some WFP, basically, but not only, among the most quoted ones, may be considered iconic in terms of their particularly relevant use on a quotidian basis and for the appreciation people has of them. Three clear examples are 
 <italic>Laurus nobilis</italic>, 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> and 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic>, with their abundant daily use as condiment (among other not so frequent uses), equalling or overcoming the use of very important condiments from foreign, cultivated plants, such as 
 <italic>Capsicum annuum</italic> L. and 
 <italic>Piper nigrum</italic> L. Similarly, but to a slightly lesser extent, another aromatic plant, 
 <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic>, has also a place among the most habitual used plants, also as a condiment, completing, with 
 <italic>Thymus</italic> and 
 <italic>Laurus</italic>, a classical 
 <italic>bouquet garni</italic>. These plants, in their daily use, are not the protagonists of the dishes in terms of volume or weight, but many popular, typical -from old or modern tradition- and highly appreciated dishes (soups, rice, stews, roasts, salads, even pizzas) could not be conceived without them. Moving to sweet, we find a similar example. To give the necessary and distinctive flavour to ‘
 <italic>bunyol</italic>’ or ‘
 <italic>brunyol’</italic> (fritter), very typical of Easter week and nowadays eaten all along the year, if cultivated 
 <italic>Pimpinella anisum</italic> L. fruits are not available, or if others are preferred to confer the anis smell and taste, 
 <italic>Carum carvi</italic> L. or 
 <italic>Foeniculum vulgare</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>piperitum</italic> fruits are used.
