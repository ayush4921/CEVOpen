<p>Finally, we can also consider an economic motivation for WFP collection or consumption. The informant’s statement “
 <italic>en van a collir de silvestres per a vendre’ls a mercat</italic>” (‘someone is collecting wild ones to sell them in the market’) [
 <xref rid="B96-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>], referred to 
 <italic>Asparagus acutifolius</italic>, and is quite clear and will be discussed in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3dot6-foods-10-00061">Section 3.6</xref>. “
 <italic>En veníem, com les maduixes de bosc</italic>” (‘we used to sell them, as well as wild strawberries’ [
 <xref rid="B102-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>], referred to the fruit of 
 <italic>Rubus idaeus</italic> L., implying also that of 
 <italic>Fragaria vesca</italic> L.), also exemplifies, as in other similar cases, the possible economic revenues resulting from WFP collection. Speaking of 
 <italic>Taraxacum dissectum</italic>, one informant remembered that “
 <italic>al temps de la misèria passaven dones que n’havien anat a collir a la muntanya i les venien, un plat valia 10 cèntims</italic>” (‘in times of scarcity, some women passed after collecting the plants in the mountain and sold them; a dish cost 10 cents’) [
 <xref rid="B47-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. For 
 <italic>Rubus idaeus</italic>, informants also quote “
 <italic>la melmelada de gerds és la més bona</italic>” (‘red raspberry jam is the best one”) [
 <xref rid="B103-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>], indicating they also use them, i.e., both taste and economy causes converge in the use of this WFP. The economic factor is not only the income perceived by selling plants, but can also be considered in terms of saving by using WFP: If, for instance, traditional knowledge allows people to collect and to prepare jams or similar products from 
 <italic>Arbutus unedo</italic> L., 
 <italic>Rubus idaeus</italic>, 
 <italic>Rubus ulmifolius</italic> or 
 <italic>Vaccinium myrtillus</italic> L. picked by themselves in the field, they should not therefore have to buy the same products in the supermarket.
