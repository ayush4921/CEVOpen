<p>The simplest procedure of preparation largely dominates, since the use of fresh plant material (implying just cleaning) and the use as a condiment (implying only cleaning and in most cases drying) represent, according to the percentages quoted in the last paragraph, around one third each of the total UR. This may have at least three explanations. First, the importance of salad WFP, in agreement to that of salads with cultivated plants, very typical in every diet. Nevertheless, other preparations than salad exist for fresh WFP, such as the ingestion of 
 <italic>Malva sylvestris</italic> L. or 
 <italic>Rubus ulmifolius</italic> fruits as aperitif and dessert, respectively. Second, the relevance of spices and condiments, again in every diet, and the large number of either cultivated or wild plants, mostly with essential oils, with this function. Finally, the ease of use itself. Preparing (exceptionally or regularly) a WFP salad is simple, and seasoning a pizza, a stew or a salad or flavouring an oil with a condiment, too. This last point parallels the fact that tisanes prepared by a simple infusion or decoction are indicated among the most important pharmaceutical forms of many ethnobotanical studies centred around medicinal plant uses ([

 <italic>Satureja montana</italic> and 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> for olive treatment and preservation all along the area studied, or 
 <italic>Thymus piperella</italic> for the same purpose, to cook snails and to prepare ‘
 <italic>gaspatxo’</italic> -a traditional SE Iberian solid dish, different from the cold soup called ‘
 <italic>gaspatxo’</italic> in Catalan and ‘
 <italic>gazpacho’</italic> in Spanish- and 
 <italic>Origanum virens</italic> for cooking typical fish or veal stews, the latter two species in southern Valencian territory. It is worth mentioning that attempts at home cultivation are not at all rare among the informants, at a local level in the homegardens or even in pots on balconies, of some condiment WFP they particularly appreciate and use frequently, as often stated during the interviews, with sentences such as “
 <italic>aquí al jardí en tenim de plantada</italic>” (‘we have it planted here in the garden’ [

 <xref rid="B103-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>], in this case referring to 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic>).
