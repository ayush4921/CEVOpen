<p>As in the case of cultivated plants, WFP preserves may be prepared salty or sweet. Many berries and other fruits (such as 
 <italic>Arbutus unedo</italic>, 
 <italic>Rosa canina</italic> L., 
 <italic>Rubus idaeus</italic>, 
 <italic>R. ulmifolius</italic> or 
 <italic>Vaccinium myrtillus</italic>) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00061-f006">Figure 6</xref>) are boiled with sugar, and the jam or similar products obtained are consumed for breakfast or as a dessert, often spread on bread or cakes. Since these fruits are boiled, we considered them, as cooked, as a preparation form, even if they constitute a preserve. As for salty, 
 <italic>Crithmum maritimum</italic> L. leaves are pickled with wine vinegar and salt, and used to accompany olives, bread spread with tomato and olive oil, ‘
 <italic>trempó</italic>’ (Balearic salad) and ‘
 <italic>sopes</italic>’ (a traditional kind of soup typical in Mallorca). Again, simple uses together with more complex ones are found, following a similar model to the one of cultivated plants.
