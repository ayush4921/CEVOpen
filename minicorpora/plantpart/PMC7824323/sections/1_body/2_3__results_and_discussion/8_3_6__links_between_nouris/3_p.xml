<p>Studies about the nutrients and the bioactive compounds of the WFP are very important to demonstrate the big potential of these plants as nutraceuticals. Sánchez-Mata et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] have carried out several nutritional studies on WFP with very interesting results, some of them related with the plants quoted in this meta-analysis. Examples of that are 
 <italic>Rumex pulcher</italic> L. with a level of vitamin B
 <sub>9</sub> (folic acid) higher than the 100% daily recommended intakes; 
 <italic>Urtica dioica</italic>, 
 <italic>Arbutus unedo</italic>, 
 <italic>Chenopodium album</italic> L., 
 <italic>Capsella bursa-pastoris</italic> (L.) Medik. and 
 <italic>Eruca vesicaria</italic> (L.) Cav. with levels of vitamin C higher than the 100% recommended intakes; 
 <italic>Celtis australis</italic> L., 
 <italic>Parietaria officinalis</italic> L. subsp. 
 <italic>judaica</italic> (L.) Béguinot and 
 <italic>Urtica dioica</italic> with calcium sources higher than the 50% daily advised; or 
 <italic>Celtis australis</italic>, 
 <italic>Sanguisorba minor</italic> Scop. and 
 <italic>Chenopodium album</italic> also with values of magnesium higher than those recommended.
