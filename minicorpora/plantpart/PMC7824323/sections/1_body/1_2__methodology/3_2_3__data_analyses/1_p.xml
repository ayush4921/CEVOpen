<p>We calculated the ethnobotanicity index (EI; [
 <xref rid="B68-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]), the quotient between the number of plants used (here taking into account WFP) and the total number of plants that constitute the flora of the territory (authochthonous plants, see an estimation above), expressed as a percentage, in order to have a general idea of the relevance of WFP in the area considered. We also calculated the informant consensus factor (F
 <sub>IC</sub>; [
 <xref rid="B69-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]), the ratio of the number of UR minus the number of used taxa to the number of UR minus one, in order to assess the consistency or robustness of the traditional knowledge of WFP in the territory. The cultural importance index (CI; [
 <xref rid="B70-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]), the sum of the proportion of informants that mention each species use, has also been calculated to identify the plants most valued by the informants.The descriptive statistics were carried out with Excel (Office 2008, Microsoft Ibérica, Pozuelo de Alarcón, Spain. The relationship between the preparation form and the most quoted plants was visualized by an alluvial diagram using RAWGraphs [
