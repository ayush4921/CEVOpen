<p>Traditional knowledge on plant biodiversity has been collected by ethnobotanical prospection in the studied area in modern times from the pioneering work of Pius Font i Quer [
 <xref rid="B64-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] and more recently, and in a continued manner to date, from the first academic works of Mulet [
 <xref rid="B65-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] and Muntané [
 <xref rid="B66-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]; see a review in Vallès [
 <xref rid="B42-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The information has been collected through semi-structured ethnobotanical interviews (see details in [
 <xref rid="B18-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and references therein) and included in a database by our research group (
 <uri xlink:href="www.etnobiofic.cat" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.etnobiofic.cat</uri>). The meta-analytic work performed in the present paper covers 31 research studies belonging to different regions throughout the CLA (

 <xref rid="B59-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. As first-level subdialects, within western we find north-western and Valencian, both represented, and within Eastern, apart from Algherese -the only one not represented, among other aspects because the current pandemic made impossible a first prospection that was foreseen-, we find northern, central and Balearic, all included in the study. Indeed, within Valencian, Central and Balearic, some second-level subdialects are also represented.
