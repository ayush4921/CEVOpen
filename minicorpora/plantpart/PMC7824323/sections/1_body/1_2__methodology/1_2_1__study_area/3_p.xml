<p>Even though it includes several big or very big cities (in decreasing order of inhabitants: Barcelona, Valencia, Palma, Perpignan), and not ignoring the importance of industry and tourism to its economy, the area studied still has a relevant rural component, and agriculture and natural spaces (including reserves, parks and other protected zones) are important. Catalan is the common language to the whole area, with two main dialects (eastern -including, among others, Balearic subdialects- and western -including, among others, Valencian subdialects-) [

Apart from this, French, Italian, Occitan, Sardinian and Spanish languages are also spoken and have different degrees of official status in one or another of the zones. The area considered includes the places where Catalan language is spoken, was spoken in the past (such as Oriola/Orihuela, where it was spoken at least until 17th century and has left an interesting substrate) or was not spoken but, by geopolitical reasons, it has had some influence (as current Catalan-speaking areas receive influences from neighbouring languages), in some cases reflected on folk plant names, such as in a few Spanish-speaking districts in Valencian community and a few Occitan-speaking areas in Spanish and French CLA. In addition, it is remarkable that, in the biggest city of this area, Barcelona, alone, more than 300 languages are spoken, due to migration flows [
