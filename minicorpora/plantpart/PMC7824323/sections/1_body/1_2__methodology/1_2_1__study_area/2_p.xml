<p>From the Mediterranean Sea level to 3143 m a.s.l. in Pica dâ€™Estats (Pyrenees), the landscape of the area considered is structured in several parts with distinct floristic and vegetation traits [

 <xref rid="B53-foods-10-00061" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The main part, at the lowest altitudes, belongs to the Mediterranean region, with 
 <italic>Quercus ilex</italic> L. and derived communities, complemented with 
 <italic>Quercus coccifera</italic> L. and 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> L. communities in warm and dry places. Low and median mountain parts are dominated by deciduous 
 <italic>Quercus</italic> and 
 <italic>Fagus sylvatica</italic> L. communities, with 
 <italic>Pinus sylvestris</italic> L. High mountain areas in the southern, more arid zones present landscapes with 
 <italic>Pinus sylvestris</italic> and 
 <italic>Juniperus sabina</italic> L. In the Pyrenees, the dominant trees of the high mountain areas are 
 <italic>Abies alba</italic> Mill. and 
 <italic>Pinus mugo</italic> Turra subsp. 
 <italic>uncinata</italic> (Ramond ex DC.) Domin, with alpine meadows and a small snow level being found at the highest altitudes. The approximate number of plant taxa (including species and subspecies) in these territories is 4300 autochthonous plus 1200 allochthonous [
