<p>In addition to the analysis of the results compiled in the database as mentioned, we performed brief, directed ethnobotanical interviews performed in September 2020 on nine people in several areas covered by this study to obtain only qualitative information on aspects related to the appreciation of some particular plants or on WFP going beyond the local use, even including current use in restaurants (see Subsector 3.6 in the Results and Discussion section). The informants were selected following our experience in this field, just to have complementary information. On the one hand, two interviewees were, respectively, the brother and the son of an informant -already deceased- present in the database analysed. On the other hand, seven interviewees were more or less connoisseurs of current wild plant appreciation, commerce or use in markets or restaurants. The information provided by these people and used here is explicitly indicated in
