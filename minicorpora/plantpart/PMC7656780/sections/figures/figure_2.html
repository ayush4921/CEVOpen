 <caption> Effects of traditional remedies on the formation of biofilms. (A,B) Total biomass quantification (crystal violet assay) and (C,D) Quantification of metabolic activity (XTT assay) of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus biofilms formed in the presence of traditional formulations. Effects of traditional remedies on eradication of pre-formed biofilms (24 h old). (E,F) Quantification of metabolic activity (XTT assay) of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus pre-formed biofilms treated with traditional medicinal formulations (LB-Luria-Bertani medium, UT-untreated biofilm, SO-sesame oil, KPE-SO- Kalanchoe pinnata; CDE-SO- Cynodon dactylon, OTE-SO- Ocimum tenuiflorum). * p value ≤0.05 is considered statistically significant; vs. untreated control, and formulations). At least two biological replicates (each with three technical replicates) were performed for all assays. </caption>
