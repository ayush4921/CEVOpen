<p>We tested the effects of the traditional remedies on planktonic growth of 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> using 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> growth curves. Overnight cultures were diluted to a concentration of 10
 <sup>7</sup> cells/ml in fresh LB broth. Each well consisted of 10 µl of this diluted culture of either pathogen (10
 <sup>5</sup> cells), with 90 µl of either LB (untreated), SO, KPE-SO, CDE-SO or OTE-SO. Uninoculated LB was used as a sterility control. The plate was incubated at 37°C with shaking in a multimode plate reader (Tecan Infinite 200 PRO) and absorbance was measured at 600 nm (optical density (OD)) every 30 min overnight (∼15–16 h).
