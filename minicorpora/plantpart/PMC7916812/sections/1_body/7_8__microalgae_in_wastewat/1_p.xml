<p>Microalgae can utilise nitrogen, phosphorus, carbon and chemicals such as heavy metals from waste water as their source of nutrients and this is called as phycoremediation [
 <xref rid="B280-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">280</xref>]. Conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is designed basically to remove organic matter and nutrients. Nitrogen (N) and Phosphorus (P) are the most important pollutants in the aquatic environments because they are discharged into water bodies in huge quantities. Removal of N and P using microalgal remediation technology has high removal efficiencies which N and P contaminants can be completely removed from WWTPs, lower costs operation, zero sludge generation and high-value products can be generated such as fatty acids, pigment, biomass, biodiesel and unicellular protein [
