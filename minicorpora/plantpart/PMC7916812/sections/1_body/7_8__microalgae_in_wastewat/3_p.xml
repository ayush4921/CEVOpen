<p>Emerging contaminants (ECs) are molecules produced in industries such as pharmaceutical (used for human beings and livestock) and chemicals, including compounds such as hormones, antibiotics, plasticizers, antipyretics, antifungal and surfactants which cannot efficiently remove by WWTPs [

 <xref rid="B290-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">290</xref>]. The removal of ECs is normally done by physicochemical processes such as photo-oxidation, ozonisation, or oxidation via metallic catalysis. Algae-based bioreactors have gained special research interest as a promising way to remove pharmaceuticals-based ECs from the wastewater either partially or completely. A wide spectrum of technologies has been used for the removal processes for ECs, mainly grouped as physical adsorption, chemical advanced oxidation and biological degradation processes and combination. Laboratory scale (open pond and bubble column photobioreactor) showed high removal percentages have been reached for ciprofloxacin, metoprolol, triclosan, and salicylic acid (&gt;90%); moderate removal for tramadol and carbamazepine (50â€“90%), and trimethoprim and ciprofloxacin show fewer promising results with very low removal (&lt;10%) [
