<p>Based on the latest research, phenol and its derivatives could be metabolized and degraded by algae. The ability of algae to remove phenolic compounds dependant with the type of algae or substrate, degradation time and initial pH. However, algae have a certain tolerance range to phenol [

Recently, microalgae-based technology has been explored as a great potential alternative for the treatment of wastewater containing antibiotics by adsorption, accumulation, biodegradation, photodegradation, and hydrolysis [
