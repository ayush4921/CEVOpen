<p>Another group of bioactive with cardioprotective properties are the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), especially the omega-3 fatty acids such as DHA, EPA and α-linoleic acid (ALA) which have been shown to reduce blood cholesterol and improve hypertension. Of these fatty acids, DHA is the only PUFA currently commercially available. Purified EPA sourced from various microalgae including 
 <italic>Porphyridium purpureum</italic> and 
 <italic>Isochrysis galbana</italic> are still not economically competitive to be produced commercially. However, a proprietary strain of microalgae 
 <italic>Nannochloropsis</italic> cultivated in an open pond with high solar radiation was shown to produce high EPA content (&gt;65%) oil marketed as A2 EPA Pure
 <sup>™</sup> for supplement and pharmaceutical applications have been reported [

However, extracted PUFAs are prone to oxidation and therefore all materials that can initiate oxidation such as copper are eliminated from the extraction and storage area [
