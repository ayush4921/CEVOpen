<p>Several microalgae-derived compounds have also been studied for its cardioprotective effect and briefly summarized in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00943-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Carotenoids are shown to possess antioxidant properties that are important for preventing cell damage caused by free radicals associated with chronic cardiovascular diseases and stroke [
 <xref rid="B57-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. In this regard, some microalgae producing a high amount of carotenoids have been investigated for their cardioprotective properties. For instance, 
 <italic>D. salina</italic> microalgae can produce up to 10–13% of β-carotene have been shown to have protective effects against atherosclerosis in both mice and humans. Furthermore, a mixture of 
 <italic>tran</italic>-isomers (~40%) and 
 <italic>cis</italic> β-carotene isomers (~60%) from 
 <italic>D. salina</italic> was found to be more potent in decreasing total lipid, cholesterol and triglyceride (TG) levels compared to all 
 <italic>trans</italic>-β-carotene found in synthetic β-carotene [
 <xref rid="B58-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Harari et al. [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] also showed that 
 <italic>cis</italic> β-carotene isomers (~50%) from 
 <italic>Dunaliella bardawil</italic> powder inhibited atherosclerosis progression in older mice with a high-fat diet. Although 
 <italic>cis</italic> β-carotene is still not produced commercially due to its high production costs, a high density inoculum enriched with 
 <italic>cis</italic> β-carotene strain from 
 <italic>D. salina</italic> are currently being developed to deliver reproducible, low-cost 
 <italic>D. salina</italic> biomass containing a high content of 9-
 <italic>cis</italic> β-carotene [
