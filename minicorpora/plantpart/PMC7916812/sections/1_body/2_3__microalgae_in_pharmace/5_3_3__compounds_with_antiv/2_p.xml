<p>Another group of compounds with antiviral activities are the cyclic peptides. The fractions containing a mixture of Icthypeptins A and Icthypeptins B, cyclic depsipeptides isolated from 
 <italic>Microcystic ichthyoblabe</italic> showed antiviral activity against influenza A virus with inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) of 12.5 µg/mL comparable to the control amantadine IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 15 µg/mL [

 <italic>Spirulina platensis</italic> showed antiviral activity against HIV-1 with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 9.3 µg/mL comparable to the dextran sulfate control when assessed by the P24 antigen assay [

 <italic>Porphyridium cruentum</italic> showed a strong inhibitory effect on the cytopathic effect on Herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1), Herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2) and Vericella virus (VZV) with CPE
 <sub>50</sub> protection of 0.7–5 µg/mL [
