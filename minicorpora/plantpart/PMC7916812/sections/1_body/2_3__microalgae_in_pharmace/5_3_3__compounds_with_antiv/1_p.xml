<p>Microalgae are also potential sources for bioactives with antiviral properties (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00943-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). For example, lectin protein with antiviral properties such as cyanovirin (CV-N) and scytovirin (SVN) have been reported [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. CV-N is a 11kDa protein consisting of 101-amino acid in single chain with two disulfide linkages and was isolated from the aqueous extract of 
 <italic>Nostoc ellpsosporum</italic> and purified by ethanol precipitation followed by fractionation and purification by column chromatography [
 <xref rid="B60-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. CV-N showed a broad spectrum of antiviral activity against human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV type-1) laboratory and clinical strains with effective concentrations (EC
 <sub>50</sub>) range 0.1–5.8 nM and 1.5–36.8 nM, respectively [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In the same study, CV-N was also active against human immunodeficiency virus-2 (HIV-2) and simian immunodeficiency virus with EC
 <sub>50</sub> 2.3–7.6 nM and 11 nM, respectively [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Although CV-N showed promising antiviral activity including in an animal HIV transmission model the clinical application of this molecule is currently limited due to its reported mitogenic activity [
 <xref rid="B61-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Meanwhile, another lectin protein SVN has been isolated from the aqueous extracts of cultured cyanobacterium 
 <italic>Scytonema varium</italic>. SVN is a 9.71kDa protein consisting of 95-amino acid chains with 5-disulfide linkage which also showed potent antiviral activity against HIV type-1 laboratory strains and clinical isolates with EC
 <sub>50</sub> between 0.3–22 nM [
