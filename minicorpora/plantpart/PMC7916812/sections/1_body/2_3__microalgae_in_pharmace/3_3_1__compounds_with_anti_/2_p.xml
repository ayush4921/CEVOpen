<p>Another promising anticancer agent is phycocyanin, a protein pigment from the phycobiliprotein group. Phycocyanins are isolated from the commercially grown microalgae 
 <italic>Spirulina platensis</italic>, but isolation from other cyanobacteria such as 
 <italic>Limnothrix</italic> sp. has also been reported (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00943-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. C-phycocyanin showed inhibitory activity in liver cancer cell lines (HepG2) [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], human leukemia cells (K562) [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and against lung cancer cell lines (A549 and NSCLC) [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In another study, the phycocyanin from 
 <italic>Limnothrix</italic> sp. enhanced the anticancer properties of the anticancer drug Topetecan against the prostate cancer cell line (LNCap) [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Meanwhile, phycocyanin isolated from as 
 <italic>Limnothrix</italic> sp. NS01 with two subunits α and β (17 and 20 kDa) showed antiproliferative activity in human breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7) [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Isolation of C-phycocyanin from 
 <italic>Spirulina platensis</italic> was accomplished using buffer ammonium sulfate solution (i.e., salting-out technique) as well as by using supercritical fluid extraction using ethanol as a modifier which resulted in higher yield compared to conventional solvent extraction [

 <xref rid="B38-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In the studies, impurities were removed using chitosan and activated charcoal however further purified the compound by ion-exchange chromatography was also carried out [
