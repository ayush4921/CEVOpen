<p>Microalgae-derived bioactives with anti-cancer properties are extensively studied in recent years [
 <xref rid="B52-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Among the compounds, the microalgae pigments such as astaxanthin, β-carotene, lutein, violaxanthin, and fucoxanthin have the most potential to be commercialized as pharmaceuticals because of their established applications as nutraceuticals and cosmetics and the rising demand as dietary supplements. In fact, astaxanthin and β-carotene are currently produced commercially from microalgae 
 <italic>Dunaliella salina</italic> (
 <italic>D. salina</italic>) and 
 <italic>Hamatococcus pluvialis</italic>, respectively, while commercial production of other carotenoids such as lutein and fucoxanthin are gaining momentum [
 <xref rid="B56-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Fucoxanthin, for instance, have been isolated from diatom microalgae 
 <italic>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</italic>, which is cultivated in a pilot-scale photobioreactor and can be considered as a commercially viable source for fucoxanthin [
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The anti-cancer properties of some of these carotenoids are summarized in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00943-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Extraction of carotenoid is achieved using ultra-sound extraction and freeze-thawing methods; however, organic solvent extraction at high temperature and pressure is a more widely used method in commercial-scale production [
