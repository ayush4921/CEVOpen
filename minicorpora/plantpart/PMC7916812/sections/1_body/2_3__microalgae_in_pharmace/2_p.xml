<p>Many studies have documented the health benefits of microalgae compounds for prevention and improvement of diseases such as diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, cancer, inflammation, Alzheimerâ€™s diseases, depression as well as bacterial, fungal, and viral infections [

Consequently, strong emphasis on the good manufacturing practices in cultivation, harvesting, extracting and purification and controls to limit toxin and impurities are required to ensure safety, efficacy, and quality of microalgae-derived purified compounds and enriched extracts for approval and commercialization [
