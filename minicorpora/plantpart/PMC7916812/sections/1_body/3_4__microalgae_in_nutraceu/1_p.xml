<p>A number of microalgae have been classified as Generally Regarded as Safe (GRAS) and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). For the guaranteed safety and valuable source of nutrients, algae are used widely in industries especially for food and nutraceutical applications. According to Watanabe [

 <italic>Spirulina</italic>, 
 <italic>Aphanizomenon</italic> and 
 <italic>Nostoc</italic> are hugely harvested for the food industry. Dried 
 <italic>Aphanizomenon</italic> contributes approximately 500 tons annually, which is dominantly produced in North America at Upper Klamath Lake, Klamath Falls, Oregon for the food supplement industry, while 
 <italic>Spirulina</italic> is widely cultured and produced in countries like United States, Taiwan, China, India, and others with an estimated output of 3000 tons annually [
