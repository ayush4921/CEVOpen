<p>Several studies and reviews have been published on the different algae strains, namely, 
 <italic>Nannochloropis oculata</italic> [

 <xref rid="B74-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], 
 <italic>C. cohnii</italic>, 
 <italic>Schizochytrium</italic> sp., 
 <italic>Ulkenia</italic> sp. which are associated with the presence of high concentration of PUFAs in its lipid [

 <xref rid="B74-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. These strains have been commercially used to develop high purity marine oils by companies such as Qualitas Health, DSM-NP, Lonza and GCI Nutrients. DHA oil from 
 <italic>C. cohnii</italic> (40â€“50%) are fortified in infant formula milk by company such as Martek, USA, thus, the cultivation and manufacturing processes follow a strict regulation of FDA and current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP). This fortified formula sold in more than 60 countries [

 <italic>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</italic> and 
 <italic>Porphyridium purpureum</italic> for EPA and other compounds were suggested [
