<p>Methods of harvesting lipid from microalgae include mechanical pressing, homogenization, milling and solvent extraction. The solvent extraction is imperative to the polarity or/and solubility of the lipid of interest. Other techniques such as enzymatic extraction, supercritical extraction, ultrasonic-assisted extraction, microwaves are used to facilitate lipid extraction by solvent [

Purification of algal oil (PUFAs) is an essential step as the crude form of these oils are inedible due to its impurities, odour, taste and unattractive for consumption as its turbid appearance. Speed of operation and process condition are critical factors in the oil purification techniques as the oil is sensitive to oxidation. Manufacturer such as Martek Bioscience Corporation has described the oil recovery and purification steps of DHA from algae oil. For instance, protease enzyme was used to break the protein in the cells of 
 <italic>Schizochytrium</italic> sp. to release the oil into the culture broth forming an emulsion, thereafter isoprophyl alcohol was added to separate the oil. While for 
 <italic>Crypthecodinium cohnii</italic>, hexane solvent extraction method was applied since the enzyme method is incapable to hydrolyse the algae cellulosic layer. Following the solvent extraction, the cell walls are removed by centrifugation and the oil was recovered after solvent evaporation [
