<p>Microalgae produce total lipid up to 30â€“70% of dry weight depending on the species; which plays a critical role as energy stockpile during adverse condition and cell division. Fatty acids are component of complex lipids and the structural variation attributes to their multitudinous benefits. Based on the polarity of the molecular head, fatty acids can be categorised into two groups; (i) neutral lipids and (ii) polar lipids. Fatty acids production can be increased in the microalgae by manipulating various environmental factors such as oxygen level, temperature, light exposure, pH as well as limiting the nutrient supplementation [
