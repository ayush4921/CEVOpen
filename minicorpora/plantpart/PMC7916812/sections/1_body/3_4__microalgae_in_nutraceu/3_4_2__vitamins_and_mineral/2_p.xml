 <italic>Chlorella</italic> is another commercial species with a rich source of proteins, essential amino acids, vitamins (B-complex, ascorbic acid), minerals (potassium, sodium, magnesium, iron, and calcium). 
 <italic>Chlorella</italic> sp. is suggested to be the best candidate for vegan source of Vitamin B
 <sub>12</sub> and used in food supplement [
 <xref rid="B99-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. According to Kumudha et al. [
 <xref rid="B66-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], Vitamin B

 <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> present as methylcobalamin, a biologically active form suitable for human consumption while Merchant et al. [
 <xref rid="B100-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>] reported that participant supplemented with 9 g 
 <italic>Chlorella pyrenoidosa</italic> daily mitigated vitamin B
 <sub>12</sub> deficiency in vegetarian and vegan participants. A study by Nakano et al. [
 <xref rid="B101-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>], suggested 6 g 
 <italic>Chlorella</italic> supplementation significantly reduced the risk of pregnancy-associated anaemia, proteinuria and oedema. All of these, suggest microalgae enriched food as a good source of nutritional supplements especially for strict vegetarians owing to its rich high-value nutrients as well as Vitamin B
 <sub>12</sub>. Chronopoulou et al. [
 <xref rid="B102-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>] proposed an improved approach to extract fat-soluble vitamins by using supercritical CO

 <sub>12</sub> from Spirulina and found the aqueous extraction suits best for this studied compound [
