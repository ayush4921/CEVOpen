<p>Microalgae constitute important source of almost all vitamin and essential minerals. 
 <italic>Spirulina</italic> was reported as rich source of vitamins B
 <sub>1</sub>, B
 <sub>2</sub>, B
 <sub>12</sub> and high content of amino acid up to 62%, [
 <xref rid="B92-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>], all of which have facilitated its claim as superior to other microalgae [
 <xref rid="B93-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. Seghiri et al. [
 <xref rid="B92-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>] also suggested that 
 <italic>Spirulina</italic> benefits may be attributed by the presence of macro-minerals as well as the trace elements. Various studies have shown that 
 <italic>Spirulina</italic> as a good source of pro-Vitamin A, in term of beta-carotene and exhibited better effects than the synthetic Vitamin A due to its good bioavailability [

 <xref rid="B95-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. This species also was reported for high content of Vitamin B
 <sub>12</sub>, in the range of 120–244 µg per g dry weight, however, studies suggested that most of it were pseudo B
 <sub>12</sub>, an analogue which has a similar structure and bound to specific B

 <xref rid="B97-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>], provided a scientific validation for the use of 
 <italic>Spirulina</italic> as Vitamin B
 <sub>12</sub> source. However, more studies needed to substantiate 
 <italic>Spirulina</italic> as a viable source of Vitamin B
 <sub>12</sub> in human. In view of high bioavailability of iron from 
 <italic>Spirulina</italic>, Puyfoulhoux et al. [
 <xref rid="B98-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>] concluded that Spirulina constitute adequate source of iron for human consumption.
