<p>The extraction of protein from microalgae comprised steps including cell disruption, extraction and product purification; cell disruption techniques involve mechanical action (high-pressure homogenisers, bead mills), ultrasounds, enzymatic or chemical treatments, thermal or osmotic shocks (repeated freezing/thawing) [

 <xref rid="B87-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] suggested an alkaline treatment followed by isoelectric precipitation. Meanwhile, Chia et al. [
 <xref rid="B88-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>] proposed an effective approach using ultrasound-assisted three phase partitioning method for efficient protein extraction and an optimised conditions for high protein recovery which is applicable for the future integrated bio-separation technique for biomolecules extraction from microalgae as well as to improve the current downstream bioprocessing techniques.
