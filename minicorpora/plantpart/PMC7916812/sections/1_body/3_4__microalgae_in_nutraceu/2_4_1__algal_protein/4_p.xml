 <italic>Chlorella</italic> and 
 <italic>Spirulina</italic> are known for its high-quality protein attributed by the well-balanced amino acid composition according to FAO/WHO recommendation [
 <xref rid="B89-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>], digestibility coefficient, as well as by its biological value of the amino acids absorbed from the food [
 <xref rid="B90-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Nevertheless, interest to acquire good quality protein for human nutrition continues with exploration on different strains of microalgae, as such, a study on Australian microalgae species in James Cook University/MBD Energy Research facility using 
 <italic>Scenedesmus</italic> sp., 
 <italic>Nannochloropsis</italic> sp., 
 <italic>Dunaliella</italic> sp., and a designed freshwater chlorophytic polyculture (CPC; consisting of 
 <italic>Schroederiella apiculata, Scenedesmus pectinatus, Tetraedrom minimum, Mesotaenium</italic> sp. and 
 <italic>Desmodesmus</italic> sp.) exhibited high quality protein in all studied microalgae. The protein was suitable for human consumption which was determined and supported by Essential amino acid index (EAAI) and was comparable to the commercial 
 <italic>Spirulina</italic> and 
 <italic>Chlorella</italic> products. The Australian strains earned higher score for EAAI due to presence of higher essential amino acids such as histidine, phenylalanine, threonine and lysine. In addition, the selected strains also displayed a comparable nutrient strength and taste as the 
 <italic>Spirulina</italic> and 
 <italic>Chlorella</italic> species respectively, thus, suggesting the potential of these microalgae for future commercialization in human nutrition area [
