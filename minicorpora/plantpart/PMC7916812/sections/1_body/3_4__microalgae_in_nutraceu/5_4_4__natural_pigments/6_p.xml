<p>Harvesting and extraction of certain algal strain can be challenging due to its nature, as such 
 <italic>D. salina</italic> harvesting deemed to be most difficult and costly compared to other commercial strains attributed to its lacking of cell walls, low concentration and small size. Many approved techniques have been developed to tackle the problem such as centrifugation and flocculation, a patented method involving mechanical harvesting [

 <xref rid="B135-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>] suggested centrifugation without flocculation method which was identified as most cost-effective technique. Other commonly used extraction methods for pigments such as astaxanthin are by mechanical treatments, chemical treatments, pressurized extraction, ultrasound and microwaves among others while a few researches have taken a greener option by using non or less toxic solvents such as acetone and ethanol for the extraction process [
