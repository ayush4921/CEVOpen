<p>Many reviews and research papers offer detailed steps on how to improve and enhance related algae cultivation and extraction methods. Development of spiral-tube photobioreactor to cultivate

 <xref rid="B133-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>], suggested the use of high-intensity red light with sufficient nutrient content for high carotenoid production by up-regulating the whole biosynthesis pathway of carotenoids. Besides its applications as a food colourant, beta-carotene is used as an additive in multivitamin supplement and tablets [
