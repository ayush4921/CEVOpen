<p>A continuous search for potential new strains for large-scale production of these pigments are still advancing as the current major strains are still limited to a few species, namely, 
 <italic>Spirulina platensis, Haematococcus pluvialis</italic> and 
 <italic>Chlorella</italic> sp. Singh et al. [
 <xref rid="B136-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>] discovered 
 <italic>Asterarcys quadricellulare</italic> PUMCC 5.1.1 strain, a green microalga with a promising characteristic for carotenoid production while Kaushal et al. [
 <xref rid="B137-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>] reported a new cyanobacterium 
 <italic>Nodularia sphaerocarpa</italic> PUPCCC 420.1 which produces phycobiliprotein and reckoned as a good candidate for production at commercial scale.
