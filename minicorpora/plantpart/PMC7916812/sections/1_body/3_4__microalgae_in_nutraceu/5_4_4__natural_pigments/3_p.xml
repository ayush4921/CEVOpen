<p>Chlorophylls, a photosynthetic green pigment present in microalgae as chlorophyll

 <italic>a</italic>, which is abundantly found in cyanobacteria such as 
 <italic>Chlorella</italic>, has been extensively used as colouring agent due to its stability [

Another prominent colourant from the microalgae with commercial applications is phycobiliproteins, a water-soluble fluorescent pigment commonly present in cyanobacteria which can be classified as four major groups according to their colours and light absorption characteristics, namely, phycoerythrin, phycocyanin, allophycocyanin and phycoerythrocyanin [

 <xref rid="B127-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>]. The phycobiliproteins were shown as a strong antioxidant which contributes to high-value nutraceutical product and its application in food mainly in dairy products, chewing gums, candy, beverage mixes and ready-to-eat cereals [

 <xref rid="B129-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. Besides being a functional ingredient and safe food colourant, this protein (eg. deep blue colour protein C-phycocyanin) are used as dietary supplement coating and functional food additives [
