Among the myriad components which were exploited for commercial purpose are fatty acids, carotenoids, vitamin, minerals, polysaccharides, and bioactive compounds. According to the latest analysis, the global market for microalgae is forecasted to reach USD 3318 million by 2022 driven mainly by the demand from pharmaceutical and nutraceutical industries [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] owing to customersâ€™ increasing health concern, interest on natural alternatives as well as escalating chronic diseases. Likewise, various microalgae derived compounds were reported to exert various skin benefits which are currently gaining attention in many aspects of cosmeceuticals. Advances of new application areas of microalgae in aquaculture and biofuel production have provided a significant rise of algae demand in the global market. Microalgae are constituted of a high level of lipids. Various research has highlighted the potential of microalgae biomass as a source of renewable energy, namely biofuel which is imperative to reduce the dependency on fossil fuel [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Microalgae have an upper hand in the biofuel production compared to other bioenergy sources (corn, sugar cane, palm oil, etc.) as they do not require arable land for cultivation, thus eliminating competition for space and resources with food crops. Some of the key players in the algae industries were Algae Tec, Pond Biofuels Incorporated, Cyanotech, Kai BioEnergy, Algae Systems and others [
