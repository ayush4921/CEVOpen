0: Microalgae are in the form of unicellular, multicellular, filamentous or siphonaceous, known as photosynthetic microorganisms that can be categorized as eukaryotic and prokaryotic [ 1].
1: Microalgae are also the largest global primary producers that consist of approximately 200,000 species [ 2] with distinctive nutrient contents as well as bioactive compounds which have a wide spectrum of commercial applications in various facets of industries including pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, cosmeceuticals, biofuels, biofertilisers, wastewater treatments, feed, and proteomics ( Figure 1).
2: Production of microalgae involves mass cultivation, recovery of biomass and downstream processes for sustainable yield to cater for food, chemical, feed, biofuel, and high value products.
3: Intrinsic factors such as temperature, salinity, light, and the availability of nutrients affect the chemical composition of the biomasses.
4: Figure 2 illustrates a few of the cultivation processes of microalgae.
