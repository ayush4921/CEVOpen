0: The applications of microalgae in industries are concentrated in a few specific species that has high economic value.
1: The highly-sought genera in the global algae market were dominated by Spirulina and Chlorella in the form of dried biomass due to various beneficial health effects [ 3].
2: Among the myriad components which were exploited for commercial purpose are fatty acids, carotenoids, vitamin, minerals, polysaccharides, and bioactive compounds.
3: According to the latest analysis, the global market for microalgae is forecasted to reach USD 3318 million by 2022 driven mainly by the demand from pharmaceutical and nutraceutical industries [ 4] owing to customers increasing health concern, interest on natural alternatives as well as escalating chronic diseases.
4: Likewise, various microalgae derived compounds were reported to exert various skin benefits which are currently gaining attention in many aspects of cosmeceuticals.
5: Advances of new application areas of microalgae in aquaculture and biofuel production have provided a significant rise of algae demand in the global market.
6: Microalgae are constituted of a high level of lipids.
7: Various research has highlighted the potential of microalgae biomass as a source of renewable energy, namely biofuel which is imperative to reduce the dependency on fossil fuel [ 5].
8: Microalgae have an upper hand in the biofuel production compared to other bioenergy sources (corn, sugar cane, palm oil, etc.)
9: as they do not require arable land for cultivation, thus eliminating competition for space and resources with food crops.
10: Some of the key players in the algae industries were Algae Tec, Pond Biofuels Incorporated, Cyanotech, Kai BioEnergy, Algae Systems and others [ 4].
