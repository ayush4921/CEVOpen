 <xref rid="B2-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] with distinctive nutrient contents as well as bioactive compounds which have a wide spectrum of commercial applications in various facets of industries including pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, cosmeceuticals, biofuels, biofertilisers, wastewater treatments, feed, and proteomics (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00943-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Production of microalgae involves mass cultivation, recovery of biomass and downstream processes for sustainable yield to cater for food, chemical, feed, biofuel, and high value products. Intrinsic factors such as temperature, salinity, light, and the availability of nutrients affect the chemical composition of the biomasses. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00943-f002">Figure 2</xref> illustrates a few of the cultivation processes of microalgae.
