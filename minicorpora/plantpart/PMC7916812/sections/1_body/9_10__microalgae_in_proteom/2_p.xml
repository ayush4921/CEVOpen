<p>The potential of microalgae in the production of proteins with biotechnological application has been explored. 
 <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> has been extensively studied for therapeutic protein production and more than 100 such proteins have been expressed successfully in this system [
 <xref rid="B318-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">318</xref>]. Microalgae-based biomanufacturing is preferred due to effectiveness in terms of cost and energy, fewer contamination chances, and simplified downstream processing. Malaria detection protein which are used in ELISA testing and cell-traversal protein as an antigen from sporozoites and ookinetes of mosquitoes have been successfully expressed and produced in 
 <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> chloroplast [
 <xref rid="B319-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">319</xref>]. Phycobiliproteins from cyanobacteria and red algae have been described to present antioxidant, hepato-protective, anti-inflammatory, immune-modulating, and anticancer effects [
