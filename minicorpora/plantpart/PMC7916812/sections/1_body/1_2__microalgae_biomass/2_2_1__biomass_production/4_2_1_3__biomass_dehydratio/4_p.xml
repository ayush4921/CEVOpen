<p>(c) Freeze-drying or Lyophilisation: It is widely used at laboratory-scale only to dry microalgae since large scale production can be very expensive [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Freeze-drying is a direct dehydration process of frozen products using sublimation mechanism. The microalgae are frozen to solidify the material within before freeze-drying. The moisture content of the microalgae is decreased slowly at low-temperature, maintaining the solid structure and the quality of the product [
