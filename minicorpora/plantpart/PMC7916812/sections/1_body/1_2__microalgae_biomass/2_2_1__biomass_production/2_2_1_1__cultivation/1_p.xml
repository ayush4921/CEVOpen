<p>There are two systems developed for the production or culturing of algal biomass: the open pond and closed photobioreactor (PBR) technologies. Open pond production is categorised into two systems: natural waters (ponds, lakes and lagoons) [

 <xref rid="B7-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The open pond is a cheaper method of large-scale algal biomass production compared to the PBR. The PBR, however, provide an excellent and controlled closed culture system for cultivation, preventing hazard or contamination from moulds, bacteria, protozoa and competition by other microalgae [
