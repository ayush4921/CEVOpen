<p>(d) Filtration: It is a process to isolate alga biomass from the liquid culture medium by using a porous membrane with various particle size ranges [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. It can be implemented through three different ways: conventional, microfiltration and ultrafiltration (isolation of metabolites). The conventional filtration is used to harvest large size microalgae (&gt;70 Î¼m) such as

 <italic>Spirulina</italic>. Microfiltration and ultrafiltration are used to harvest smaller size microalgae, equal to the size of the bacteria [
