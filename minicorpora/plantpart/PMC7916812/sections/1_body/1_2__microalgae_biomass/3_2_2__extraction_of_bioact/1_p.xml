<p>The microalgae are composed of carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, minerals and many other compounds. To utilise the compounds for different application such as for biofuels/energy and agricultural use, the algal biomass will be pre-treated to release the stored bioactive compound in the cells [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The cell walls will be lysed to enable all the desired components to be extracted, and this may be accomplished by various ways, such as physical, mechanical (bead milling, homogenisation, microwave, ultrasonic and pulsed electric field), chemical (solvent, acid and alkali) and biological (enzymes) methods. The method chosen for the pre-treatment process is based on the desired final products [
