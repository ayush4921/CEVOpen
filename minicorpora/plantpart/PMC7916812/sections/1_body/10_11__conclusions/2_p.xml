<p>In conclusion, it is vital that more efforts should be taken in developing multi-functional range of products, that are affordable and is inter-related with nutritional science that could cater for even more health benefits comparatively to the ones in current market. These findings would bring much more insights into the vast potentials of microalgae-derived metabolites that remain to be explored and assessed. Further roadmap towards enhancing phycoeconomy is recommended by uplifting the current biological and technology process by taking into account on sustainability and environmental benefits.</p>
