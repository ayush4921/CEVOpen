<p>Green microalgae and cyanobacteria can produce hydrogen through biophotolysis process. They possess chlorophyll a and the photosynthetic systems; Photosystem II (PS II) and Photosystem I (PS I), that enables them to perform photosynthesis by absorbing solar energy and converting water into hydrogen and oxygen [

 <xref rid="B215-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">215</xref>]. Biophotolysis can be divided into two; direct and indirect pathways. During direct biophotolysis, water splitting at PS II generated electron and proton, giving rise to H
 <sub>2</sub> in both green algae and cyanobacteria. For indirect biophotolysis, the degradation of carbon compounds will generate protons and electrons for the production of hydrogen which are mostly found in cyanobacteria [
