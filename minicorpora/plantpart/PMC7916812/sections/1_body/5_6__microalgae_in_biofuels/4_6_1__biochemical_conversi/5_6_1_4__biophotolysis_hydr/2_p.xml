<p>There are several green microalgae and cyanobacteria such as 
 <italic>Tetraspora</italic> sp. CU2551, 
 <italic>R. rubrum, R. spheroides, Rhodobacter capsulatus, C. vulgaris, C. reinhardtii, Anabaena</italic> sp. and 
 <italic>Nostoc</italic> sp. which have been widely studied for the hydrogen production [
