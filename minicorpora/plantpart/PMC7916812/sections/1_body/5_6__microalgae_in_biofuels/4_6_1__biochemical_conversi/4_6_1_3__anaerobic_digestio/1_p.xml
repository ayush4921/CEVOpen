<p>Microalgae can be converted to biogas through anaerobic digestion which is a biochemical process that mineralizes organic material through the action of microorganisms in the absence of oxygen [
 <xref rid="B210-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">210</xref>]. Biogas is mainly made up of a mixture of methane, CH
 <sub>4</sub> (50–70%), CO
 <sub>2</sub> (30–45%) and traces of other gases such as hydrogen, H
 <sub>2</sub> (&lt;2%) and hydrogen sulphide, H
 <sub>2</sub>S (&lt;3.5%). The process involves three stages; hydrolysis, acetogenesis/acidogenesis and methanogenesis [
 <xref rid="B211-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">211</xref>]. Biogas production is often reduced due to the thick and rigid microalgae cell wall, therefore it is normally incorporated with production of other bioproducts such as biodiesel or bioethanol [
 <xref rid="B212-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">212</xref>]. To overcome the cell wall problems, pre-treatment is usually done to enhance the process. Pre-treatment with heat was found to enhance the production of biomethane from
