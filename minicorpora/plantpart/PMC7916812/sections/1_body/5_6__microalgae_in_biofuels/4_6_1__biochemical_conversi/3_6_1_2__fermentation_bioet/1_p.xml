<p>The chemical and enzymatic pre-treatment method are usually used in the production of bioethanol. The common strong acids used include hydrochloric, sulfuric and nitric acid, whereas enzymes such as amylases, cellulases and invertases are used. However, using enzymes can be rather expensive if involves large scale production [
