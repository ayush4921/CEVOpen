<p>Previous studies have shown that several microalgae species can act as an effective feedstock for the production of bioethanol. The species include 
 <italic>Chlorococcum humicola, Scenedesmus abundans PKU AC 12, Chlorella vulgaris</italic> FSP-E, 
 <italic>Scenedesmus obliquus</italic> CNW-N, 
 <italic>Porphyridium cruentum, Desmodesmus</italic> sp., 
 <italic>Spirulina platensis</italic> and 
 <italic>Scenedesmus acuminatus</italic> (Refer 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00943-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). A comparison study of red microalgae (
 <italic>P. cruentum</italic>) culture conditions for bioethanol production was done by Kim and co-workers in 2017 [
 <xref rid="B201-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">201</xref>]. The results indicated ethanol conversion yields from 
 <italic>P. cruentum</italic> cultured in freshwater was much higher (70.3%) than the 
 <italic>P. cruentum</italic> cultured in seawater (65.4%). Recently, Chandra et al. [
 <xref rid="B202-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">202</xref>] study the effect of the cultural variables on the carbohydrate accumulation of 
 <italic>Scenedesmus acuminatus</italic> to produce bioethanol. The bioethanol yield obtained was 0.12 g/g with the supplementation of lysine in the medium culture and at higher initial culture pH (pH 9.0).
