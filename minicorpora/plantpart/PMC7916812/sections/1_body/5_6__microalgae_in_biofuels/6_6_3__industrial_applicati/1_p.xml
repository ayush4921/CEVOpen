<p>The potential of microalgae to be used as a source of biofuel in the future to replace the fossil fuel has always been a concerned [

However, there are several challenges that need to be addressed to enable success which include the development of low-cost, effective cultivation systems, efficient and energy-saving harvesting techniques because there are problems to discard large volumes of water during harvesting and methods for oil extraction and conversion that are environmentally friendly and cost-effective by selecting the best strain for higher production of biofuel [

 <xref rid="B231-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">231</xref>]. In terms of cost, the harvesting process may involve a lot of money and commercialization will be too expensive as reported by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) who has been doing research in this area for about 16 years from the year 1980s to 1990s [

In 2017, after 8 years of collaboration with a biotechnology company Synthetic Genomics, they announced a major breakthrough in producing microalgae with 40 percent more lipids while maintaining growth rates using CRISPRCas9 genome editing technique [

Although the microalgae-based biofuel production could not be commercialised in near future, there is still a possibility of using microalgae for biofuels in the future because of the abundance of resources such as the significant amount of land, water and CO

 <xref rid="B232-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">232</xref>]. Lately, algal biofuel production has attracted interest again from many researchers to explore in this field to be commercialised later. The areas of study and development that need to be considered to achieve success are in the cultivation, harvesting and extraction methods where the growth rate of microalgae need to be enhanced with a more robust alga growing systems, new species/strains with high lipid content need to be sought or the lipid content in the microalgae needs to be enhanced in various ways which are found to be appropriate and the development of an efficient method for the biofuel extraction needs to be explored so as not to increase the production cost [
