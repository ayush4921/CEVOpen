<p>The first generation of biofuels comes from terrestrial crops (e.g., maize, sugarcane, sugar beet and rapeseed) which has many drawbacks/limitations causing destruction of forests and the abundant usage of water. The second generation is from forest residues, lignocellulosic agriculture and from non-food crop feedstocks which disadvantage is the land use [

Biofuels are the renewable energy sources produced from algal biomass which is the third generation of biofuels and is a promising alternative method to the previous methods. The advantages of using algae to generate fuels/energy are that it can be produced all-year-round, easy to cultivate in water without much effort, requires less water compared to terrestrial crops, does not require pesticides or herbicides thus reducing the cultivation cost [
