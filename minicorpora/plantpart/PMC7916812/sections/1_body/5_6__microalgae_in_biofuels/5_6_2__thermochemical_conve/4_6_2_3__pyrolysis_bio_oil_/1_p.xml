<p>Bio-oil, syngas and charcoal can be produced through pyrolysis; the conversion of microalgae biomass in the absence of oxygen at medium to high temperatures (400–600 °C) [
 <xref rid="B227-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">227</xref>]. Different products produced at different stages of temperature and duration of the process. Bio-oil is produced with a moderate temperature (500 °C) and a short-time exposure to vapour known as flash pyrolysis. Syngas is produced through fast pyrolysis at moderate temperature (500 °C) and moderate time exposure to vapour. Charcoal is produced through slow pyrolysis at a lower temperature (400 °C) and long-time exposure to vapour [
