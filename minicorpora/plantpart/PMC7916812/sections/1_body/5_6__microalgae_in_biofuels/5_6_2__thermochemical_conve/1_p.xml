<p>Thermochemical conversion is a process whereby microalgae biomass is converted to biofuels with the involvement of heat at a different temperature depending on the final product desired. This method can be used for both dry and wet biomass. Normally, in the thermochemical conversion no chemicals are added and the period for producing biofuels from this method is shorter than the biochemical conversion [
