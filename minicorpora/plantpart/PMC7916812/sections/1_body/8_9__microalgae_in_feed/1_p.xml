<p>Microalgae biomass have also been successfully employed in feed formulations for different animals like cattle, fish, goat, lamb, poultry, pigs and rabbits. In aquaculture, species of genus such as Nannochloropsis, Isochrysis, Pavlova, Phaeodactylum, Chaetoceros, Skelotenma, Thalassiosira and Tetraselmis are used as biomass [
 <xref rid="B310-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">310</xref>]. A microalgae, 
 <italic>D. salina</italic> has been applied in animal feed for its rich protein (57% d.w.) and carbohydrates (32% d.w.) contents [

The combination of 5–15% of algal biomass, mixed with animal feed, can be used safely as a partial replacement for conventional proteins. However, the use of higher concentrations of microalgae biomass results in less feed intake by some animals due to the lower palatability of the feed. The quality of proteins with microalgal sources have a comparable or superior functionality (either as foam, emulsifier, solubilizer, surfactant, or gelling agent) equal or even greater than other commercial protein sources [
 <xref rid="B312-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">312</xref>]. Chlorella biomass showed that it can be digested easily up to 5% in the form of paste [

DHA and EPA are not synthesized by fish and the only resource to enrich them in fish are by accumulating them in proper algal paste and store them as fish feed [

 <italic>C. vulgaris</italic> and 
 <italic>A. platensis</italic>, consist of amino acid profiles that show similarities to soybean which is currently the main source of protein used in feed. In addition, the microalgal biomass is a potential source of minerals;

 <italic>A. platensis</italic>, 
 <italic>Micractinium reisseri</italic>, 
 <italic>Nannochloris bacillaris</italic>, and 
 <italic>Tetracystis</italic> sp. showed very high contents of iron in contrast to soybean [
