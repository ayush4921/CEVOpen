<p>Oxidative stress process impacts the skin mainly in terms of premature ageing, uneven skin tone/texture and also might disintegrate the essential proteins. Once the collagen and elastin in the dermal skin layer are diminished via oxidative stress, this also involves significant DNA damage, inflammatory response, reduced antioxidant protection and the generation of matrix metalloprotein. In the long run, this results in expedited ageing process along with significant appearance of wrinkles with loss of elasticity [

 <italic>Phaeodactylum tricornotum, Odontella aurita</italic> and 
 <italic>Isochrysis aff. Galbana</italic> is one important metabolite that was identified to portray antioxidant activity as well as preventing oxidative stress. Astaxanthin is reported to possess higher antioxidant activity compared to vitamin A or E, and a recent study by Davinelli and co-workers in the year 2018 highlighted its potential as a potent anti-wrinkle and antioxidant agent [
