<p>In response to nervous stress, the neurotrophins signal becomes crucial for some inflammatory process (atopic dermatitis, psoriasis) where it induces proliferation of cutaneous nerve endings along with symptoms ranging from itchiness and pain [

Despite of the limited findings available on microalgae extracts implications on skin disorders, however, there are several bioactive compounds derived from microalgae that are shown to be effective. One such example is of the compound astaxanthin where it is vital in suppressing neuropathic pain in rats; where this involves inhibition of
