<p>Almost all cosmetic products are incorporated with synthetic colourants which attracts much attention of the cosmetic industry towards identifying colourants from natural sources for long-term sustainability. Microalgae pigments fit well into these criteria where it is classified as a naturally sustainable source with added health benefits that include UV protection, anti-ageing, antioxidant and anti-bacterial properties. Carotenoids, chlorophylls and phycobiliproteins encompass the major classes of pigments in microalgae; where they impart various colours ranging from green, yellow, brown and red making it suitable as an alternative to synthetic colourants [

 <italic>Spirulina</italic> sp. is a blue-green compound and widely used for its stable nature [

 <italic>Spirulina</italic> sp. or 
 <italic>Arthrospira</italic> sp.). In the Japanese cosmetic market, phycocyanin isolated from 
 <italic>Arthrospira</italic> sp. has been commercialized as cosmetic colourants and eye shadow products [
