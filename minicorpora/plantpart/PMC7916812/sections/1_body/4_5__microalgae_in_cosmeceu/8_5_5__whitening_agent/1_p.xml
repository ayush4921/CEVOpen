<p>In contrast to tanning effect, the favourability towards fairer skin tone especially among Asian women has attracted much interest on whitening products as part of their beauty regime. Whitening effect of skin arises with the inhibition of tyrosinase enzyme, which plays vital role in melanin biosynthesis. Tyrosinase catalyses melanin synthesis via L-tyrosine hydroxylation to 3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine (L-DOPA) as well as oxidation of L-DOPA to dopaquinone followed by further conversion to melanin [
