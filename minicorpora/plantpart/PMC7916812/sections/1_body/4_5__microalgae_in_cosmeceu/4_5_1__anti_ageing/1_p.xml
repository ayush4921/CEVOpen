<p>Ageing is a process that involves a decrease in skin structural proteins (elastin, collagen, hyaluronic acid) synthesis leading to loss in skin elasticity, laxity, integrity and finally gives rise to visible signs of ageing. Apart from decreased protein synthesis, age-dependent down-regulation of skin elasticity is also contributed by an up-regulation of the corresponding proteinases. Hence, the most appropriate anti-ageing strategy in order to attain smooth and healthy skin is by controlling the skin structural constituentsâ€™ degradation via proteinase activity regulation. In addition, frequent and repetitive exposure to ultraviolet (UV) results in over-production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that induces oxidative cellular stress and promotes genetic alterations thereby affecting matrix protein structure as well as functions, which eventually results in skin damage. In order to overcome this issue, there is a strong need to scavenge these free radicals [
