<p>Skin entity is the largest organ which acts as a physical barrier to protect the human body from harmful external agents, and is composed of three main layers (epidermis, dermis, hypodermis) [

 <xref rid="B140-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>]. A healthy and radiant skin is maintained via a balance between synthesis and degradation of the matrix proteins such as collagen, elastin and glycosaminoglycans (hyaluronic acid). The corresponding proteinases coupled with continual synthesis are the maintenance mechanism involved in this process. However, this balance is affected via both chronological as well as photo-ageing by coupling the proteinases up-regulation, where this enhances protein degradation along with synthesis down-regulation. Protein synthesis simulation or alteration of their breakdown via proteinases is the suggested mechanism of action for improving this inequality [
