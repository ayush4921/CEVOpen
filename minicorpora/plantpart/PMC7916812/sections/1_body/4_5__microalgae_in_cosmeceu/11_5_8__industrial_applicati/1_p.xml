<p>Microalgae-based products have gained much popularity, and are continuously ventured. Although the marketed products keep increasing over the years, yet it is still under par compared to its active ingredient potential. Most of the products are those focused mainly on antioxidant and photo-ageing protections; where there are still much more to be explored in terms of products intended for skin appendages treatment, modulation of fat adipokines as well as the skin microbiota [

At the same time, it is still important to highlight that it is economically disadvantageous in microalgae exploitation as an isolated active compound source due to the relevantly high cost of biomass production as well as purification [

Despite of these, continual recommendation and exploration to utilise microalgae-derived metabolites for the synthesis of products with multiple uses are inter-related with it being fully natural source along with its numerous benefits especially in cosmetic care [
