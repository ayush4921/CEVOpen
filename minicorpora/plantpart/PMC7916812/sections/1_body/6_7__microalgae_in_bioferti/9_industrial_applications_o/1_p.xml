<p>The cost of using chemical fertilisers are increasing every year due to the high demand for foods from plants since it is one of the major important components for plant growth, especially for food production. Microalgae-derived biofertiliser can be an alternative for chemical fertiliser and has gained more popularity due to the natural effects they provide to the crops and the surrounding soil. The chemical fertiliser may cause several problems, among them are the pollution (soil, water, air) to the environment, reducing input efficiency, decreasing food quality, developing resistance in weeds, diseases and insects, micronutrient deficiency in the soil, degradation of soil and causing toxicity effect to different beneficial organisms living in the soil [

Several countries have successfully commercialised the microalgae-derived biofertiliser products, which include the developing and developed countries. Previously in 2019, a Spanish company, Biorizon Biotech, S.L. had applied a patent for the method of obtaining concentrates of biofertilisers and biostimulants for agricultural use from green microalgae and cyanobacteria biomass [
