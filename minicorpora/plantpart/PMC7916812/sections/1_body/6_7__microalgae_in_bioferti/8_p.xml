<p>Some researchers had tried using a mixture of different microalgae species or a combination of microalgae and other organic or chemical fertilisers to further enhance its effectiveness. Maize plant treated with 
 <italic>C. vulgaris</italic> and 
 <italic>S. platensis</italic> along with cow dung manure for 75 days under greenhouse conditions, appeared to improve the growth and yield of the maize plant [

 <xref rid="B245-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">245</xref>] utilised a mixed culture of 
 <italic>C. vulgaris</italic> (UTEX 2714) and 
 <italic>Scenedesmus dimorphus</italic> (UTEX 1237) biomass as biofertiliser for rice plant. The biofertiliser showed efficacy with a significant increase in height of the rice plant. Growth parameters of onion plants were found to enhance with the application of a mixture of 
 <italic>S. platensis</italic> and 
 <italic>C. vulgaris</italic> showing higher growth rate and yield compared to the control group [
