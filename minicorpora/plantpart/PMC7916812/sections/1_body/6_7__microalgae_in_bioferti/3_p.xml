<p>The treatment using green microalgae/cyanobacteria have shown many beneficial effects on the plants and soils. The seed germination, plant growth, yield and the nutritional value of the crops is enhanced besides the improvement of the soil fertility. The carbon and organic content of the soil were accelerated due to the excretion of carbon (exopolysaccharides) by the green microalgae/cyanobacteria into the soil and the degradation of the biomass and grazing activity add on to the increment [
