<p>The cyanobacteria can colonize different parts of a plant tissue such as in the roots and shoots, stimulating the nitrogen fixation and phosphorus solubilising microbial population on that parts, thus enhancing and improving the growth, nutritional status and defence mechanism of the plant and soil fertility [
