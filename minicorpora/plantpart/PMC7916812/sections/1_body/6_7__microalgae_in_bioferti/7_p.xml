<p>The use of green microalgae/cyanobacteria as biofertiliser can increase the activity of defence mechanism of the plants and improve their immunity by increasing the plant RNA activity, producing nutrient assimilating enzymes; dehydrogenase, nitrate reductase, acid or alkaline phosphatase, generating antioxidant and plants defence enzymes such as peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase, phenylalanine ammonia lyase and Î²-1, 3-endoglucanase in root and shoot of the plants [

 <xref rid="B267-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">267</xref>]. Different strains of microalgae might provide different levels of defence mechanisms as shown by a study by Babu et al. [

 <italic>Anabaena laxa</italic> RPAN8, 
 <italic>Calothrix</italic> sp. and 
 <italic>Anabaena</italic> sp. CW2) inoculated in wheat plant showed the highest activity of peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase with
