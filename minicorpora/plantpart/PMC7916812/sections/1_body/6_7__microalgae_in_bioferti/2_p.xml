<p>The majority of cyanobacteria can fix nitrogen from the atmosphere and several species are known to be efficient as cyanobacterial-based biofertilisers such as

 <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> as one of the most commonly used microalgae in biofertiliser studies. The germination of 
 <italic>Hibiscus esculentus</italic> was accelerated using combined seed and soil treated with 
 <italic>C. vulgaris.</italic> Significant improvement of the soil nutrient content and microorganism count before treatment with the biofertiliser was also observed [
