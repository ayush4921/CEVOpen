<p>A study by Bumandalai et al. [
 <xref rid="B244-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">244</xref>] exhibited the potential of 
 <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> as biofertiliser for the germination of tomato and cucumber seeds. The length of the tomato and cucumber roots and shoots were improved using algal suspensions of 0.17 and 0.25 g/L, respectively. Treatment of plants with 
 <italic>A. dimorphus</italic> biofertiliser before seedling transplant showed enhanced germination, increased production of branches and flowers compared to the control group and the treatment group applied during transplant [

 <xref rid="B245-molecules-26-00943" ref-type="bibr">245</xref>] successfully used de-oiled microalgal biomass of 
 <italic>Scenedesmus</italic> sp. as biofertiliser to improve the growth of rice plant.
