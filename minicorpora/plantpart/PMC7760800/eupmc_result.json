    "This paper reports data from a characterization study conducted on the unsaponifiable lipid fraction of dry-grind corn bioethanol side streams. Phytosterols, squalene, tocopherols, tocotrienols, and carotenoids were quantified by High Performance Liquid Chromatography with Diode-Array Detector (HPLC-DAD) and Liquid Chromatography-tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in different lots of post-fermentation corn oil and thin stillage collected from a bioethanol plant over a time-span of one year. Fat-soluble bioactives were present at high levels in corn oil, with a prevalence of plant sterols over tocols and squalene. Beta-sitosterol and sitostanol accounted altogether for more than 60% of total sterols. The carotenoid profile was that typical of corn, with lutein and zeaxanthin as the prevalent molecules. The unsaponifiable lipid fraction profile of thin stillage was qualitatively similar to that of post-fermentation corn oil but, in quantitative terms, the amounts of valuable biomolecules were much lower because of the very high dilution of this side stream. Results indicate that post-fermentation corn oil is a promising and sustainable source of health-promoting bioactive molecules. The concomitant presence of a variegate complex of bioactive molecules with high antioxidant potentialities and their potential multifaceted market applications as functional ingredients for food, nutraceutical, and cosmeceutical formulations, make the perspective of their recovery a promising strategy to create new bio-based value chains and maximize the sustainability of corn dry-grind bioethanol biorefineries."
