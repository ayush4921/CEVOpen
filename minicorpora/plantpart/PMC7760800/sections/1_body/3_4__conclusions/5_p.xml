<p>Even though post-fermentation corn oil is currently utilized by biofuel biorefineries as a feedstock for biodiesel production, its full potentials are actually unexploited since molecules other than fatty acids remain unused. A preliminary separation and fractionation of sterols and other unsaponifiables from corn bioethanol oil would therefore not only maximize the efficiency of biodiesel production, actually hindered by the presence of these molecules, but would also add value to the whole biotech process, opening perspectives for the creation of integrated biorefineries and new value chains.</p>
