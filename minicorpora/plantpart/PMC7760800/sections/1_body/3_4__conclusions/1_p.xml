<p>This study highlights the potentialities of dry-grind corn bioethanol side streams as sustainable sources of bioactive compounds for high-value applications. Chromatographic analyses on post-fermentation corn oil indicated that this fuel ethanol co-product is particularly rich of plant sterols and stanols and also retains the whole set of tocopherols, tocotrienols, and carotenoids originating from the corn kernel.</p>
