<p>Upon arrival at CREA laboratories, corn oil and thin stillage samples were immediately refrigerated (+4 °C). Corn oil was preserved from light and heat and analyzed without any pre-treatment. Before sampling for analyses, the oil was brought to room temperature and gently shaken in order to re-suspend any solid material sedimented at the bottom of the bottle. Thin stillage was subject to lyophilization before analyses. Total lipids were extracted from the freeze-dried thin stillage (about 5 g) with methanol, chloroform, and water according to the method of Bligh and Dyer [

A specific protocol for extraction of carotenoids from thin stillage was applied as follows. Freeze-dried thin stillage (about 500 mg) was extracted with acetone: methanol (70:30
