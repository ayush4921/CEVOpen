<p>In the period June 2018–September 2019, approximately at monthly intervals, 1 L corn oil and 3 L thin stillage were delivered (24–48 h from collection) to CREA-Research Centre for Food and Nutrition (Rome, Italy) for analyses. The first samples (lot 1) were obtained from the 2017 corn harvest. The new harvest season started in September 2018 and by October 2018 (lot 2) the newly harvested corn was utilized for the bioethanol production process. Up to eleven lots of corn oil and seven lots of thin stillage have been analyzed. The sampling date at ENVIRAL’s plants of the different side stream lots analyzed in the study are the following: Lot 1 = 29 June 2018, Lot 2 = 22 October 2018, Lot 3 = 26 November 2018, Lot 4 = 9 December 2018, Lot 5 = 18 January 2019, Lot 6 = 25 February 2019, Lot 7 = 22 April 2019, Lot 8 = 23 May 2019, Lot 9 = 21 June 2019, Lot 10 = 29 July 2019, Lot 11 = 26 September 2019.</p>
