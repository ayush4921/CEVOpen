<p>The concentrations of stock solutions of pure standards were determined spectrophotometrically using their specific absorption coefficients. External linear calibration curves of analytical standards, with a minimum of five concentration levels, were constructed for each analyte. The DAD response for each analyte was linear within the calibration ranges with correlation coefficients exceeding 0.998. Repeatability was estimated by calculating the coefficient of variation (CV) after repeated runs of a standard solution containing each compound at the level found in samples. After HPLC runs, the purity of analytes was checked by matching the UV/Vis spectra of each peak with those of the standards. The standard reference material NIST 3278 (Tocopherols in edible oils) was analyzed for validation of the method and quality control of tocopherol data.</p>
