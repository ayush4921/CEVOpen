<p>Untreated corn oil and thin stillage extracts were also analyzed in the LC-MS/MS system in order to improve the identification of the detected compounds. Analyses were performed on an Agilent 1200 quaternary pump coupled to a 6410 series triple quadrupole. The ion source was an APCI operated in positive mode. Chromatographic separation was conducted on an ACME C18-120A, 100 mm × 2.1 mm column, with 3 µm particle size. Mobile phase was acetonitrile/methanol (50:50,

 <italic>v</italic>) in isocratic conditions, at a flow rate of 300 µL min
 <sup>−1</sup>. The APCI ionization parameters were as follows: Gas temperature 350 °C, vaporizer 375 °C, gas flow 6 L min
 <sup>−1</sup>, nebulizer 60 psi, capillary voltage 3000 V and corona current 8 µA. Because of a the higher sensibility of the MS/MS detector regarding to the DAD, the concentration of sitostanol in the samples was measured in this system. For doing it, the triple quadrupole analyzer was operated in the MRM mode, with precursor ion 399.7 (corresponding to the molecular weight with the loss of a water molecule and an H
 <sup>+</sup> gain) and the following product ions: 95.1, used for quantification, 135.1, 109.1, and 81.1. In all cases the collision energy was 29 V, with the exception of transition 399.1 → 81.1, where it was set at 45 V. Quantification was performed by interpolation on a calibration curve constructed with pure sitostanol standard analyzed in the same conditions, in the range of 0.04 to 1.0 µg mL
