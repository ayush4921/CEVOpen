<p>Analytes in corn oil and extracts of thin stillage were separated and quantified by HPLC before and after saponification to account for the presence of free compounds and of the total amounts released after ester hydrolysis. For analyses of free compounds, direct analyses of diluted corn oil and lipid extracts of thin stillage were accomplished. An aliquot of corn oil or lipid extract was diluted in a known volume of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE)/methanol (1:1,

The total amount of each component, including also the bound fractions released after ester hydrolysis, was determined after saponification. For tocopherols, tocotrienols, plant sterols, and squalene evaluation, saponification in ethanolic potassium hydroxide (10%
