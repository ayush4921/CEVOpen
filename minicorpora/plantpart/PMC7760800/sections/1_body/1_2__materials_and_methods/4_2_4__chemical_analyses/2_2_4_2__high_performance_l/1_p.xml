<p>Chromatographic analyses were carried out on a 1100 Series Agilent HPLC System (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with a quaternary pump, solvent degasser, column thermostat, and photodiode-array (DAD) detector. Tocopherols, tocotrienols, plant sterols, and squalene were determined simultaneously on a reversed-phase Ultrasphere C-18 column (25 cm × 4.6 mm inner diameter, 5 µm, Beckman, Palo Alto, CA., USA) coupled with a C18 guard column (15 cm × 4.6 mm, 5 µm). The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile/methanol (50:50,
