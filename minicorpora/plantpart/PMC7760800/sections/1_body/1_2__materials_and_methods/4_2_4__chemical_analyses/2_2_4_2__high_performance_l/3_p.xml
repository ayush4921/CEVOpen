<p>Analytes were identified by comparing retention times and UVâ€“Vis absorption spectra to those of authentic standards. Peak areas were used to determine the analyte concentrations in the samples by reference to standard curves obtained by chromatographing pure substances under identical conditions. Data were analyzed with the Agilent ChemStation Software. The analyte contents are expressed as mg per kg of product.</p>
