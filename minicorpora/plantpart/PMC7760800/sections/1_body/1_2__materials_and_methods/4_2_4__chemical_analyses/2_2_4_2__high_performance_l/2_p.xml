<p>Separation of carotenoids occurred on a reversed-phase C-30 column (25 cm × 4.6 mm inner diameter, 5 µm) coupled with a C30 guard cartridge (10 mm, 4 mm, particle size 5 μm), both from YMC Co., Ltd. (Basel, Switzerland). The mobile phase consisted of methanol (eluent A), MTBE (eluent B), and water (eluent C). The gradient program was as follows: time 0: 81% A—15% B—4% C, time 90 min: 7% A—90% B—3% C. Flow rate was 0.7 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup> and the column temperature was kept constant at 25 °C. Injection volume was 20 µL. Carotenoids were integrated at 450 nm. Chromatograms were also registered at 325 nm to monitor the elution of steryl ferulate esters in direct extracts. Ultraviolet-visible spectra were recorded over the range 250–680 nm in steps of 2 nm.
