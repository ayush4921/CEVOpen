<p>Levels of single carotenoids and average and standard deviation of total amounts observed in post-fermentation corn oil are reported in 
 <xref rid="foods-09-01788-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. The carotenoid profile of post-fermentation corn oil was that typical of corn, with lutein and zeaxanthin, accounting altogether for over 60% of the total carotenoids, as the prevalent molecules. Minor amounts of β-cryptoxanthin and traces of β-carotene were also present. Cis-isomers of lutein and zeaxanthin, most probably resulting from the high temperatures reached during the biotech process, were also observed and quantified as lutein-equivalents. One of these compounds (N.I.C. 6) was the third most concentrated carotenoid, followed by β-cryptoxanthin.
