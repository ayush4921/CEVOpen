In particular lutein and zeaxanthin, the prevalent xanthophylls in corn, are interesting molecules for the food, pharmaceutical, and nutraceutical sectors because of their strong antioxidant properties and their important role in the maintenance of the normal visual function in humans. As essential components of the eye macula, they protect the retina from the oxidative damages responsible of age-related macular degeneration and cataract [

Although fresh vegetables and fruits are a rich source of carotenoids in our diet, the formulation of functional food enriched with carotenoids is a suitable and successful strategy to compensate for nutritional losses occurring during the technological processes or to integrate them in food matrixes not inherently rich of these molecules [
