<p>The average amounts of single carotenoids identified in the different lots of thin stillage analyzed and the average and standard deviation of all values, expressed both on a wet mass and on a dry mass basis, are reported in 
 <xref rid="foods-09-01788-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>. The carotenoid profile of thin stillage was qualitatively very similar to that of post-fermentation corn oil while the concentration, as expected, was much lower. As for corn oil, the amount of carotenoids in the different lots of thin stillage analyzed showed high variability.
