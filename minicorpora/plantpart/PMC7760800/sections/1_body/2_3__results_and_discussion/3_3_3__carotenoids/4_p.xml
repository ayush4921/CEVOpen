<p>In cereals, carotenoids are important phytonutrients responsible for the yellow color of the endosperm, where they occur either in free or esterified forms, mostly with palmitic and linoleic acid. In corn the major carotenoids are the xanthophylls zeaxanthin and lutein, isomers differing by the position of a double bond in the β-ionone ring, with minor amounts of β-cryptoxanthin and β-carotene.</p>
