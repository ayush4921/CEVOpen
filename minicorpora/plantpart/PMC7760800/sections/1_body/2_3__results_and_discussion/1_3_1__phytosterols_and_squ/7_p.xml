<p>As observed for corn oil, thin stillage contained β-sitosterol as the prevalent sterol (88.3–170 mg kg
 <sup>−1</sup> on a wet mass basis), followed by sitostanol (47.4–86.6 mg kg
 <sup>−1</sup>), campesterol + stigmasterol (29.5–54.0 mg kg
 <sup>−1</sup>), a sterol tentatively identified as δ-5-avenasterol (18.0–61.3 mg kg
 <sup>−1</sup>) and trace amounts of ergosterol (4.87–11.3 mg kg
 <sup>−1</sup>). The percent distribution of single sterols in post-fermentation corn oil and thin stillage were similar as can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-foods-09-01788">Figure S1</xref>. In absolute terms, the sterol content of thin tillage is very low on a wet mass basis (205–322 mg kg
 <sup>−1</sup> wet mass) compared to corn oil (15832–17912 mg kg
 <sup>−1</sup>). Squalene, at levels comprised between 10.1 and 19.2 mg kg
 <sup>−1</sup> wet mass, was also detected in thin stillage.
