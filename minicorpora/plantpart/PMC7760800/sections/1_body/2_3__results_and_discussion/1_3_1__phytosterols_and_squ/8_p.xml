<p>The perspective to recover plant sterols and squalene from corn bioethanol co-products for further application in food and nutraceutical products adds value and sustainability to the whole fuel ethanol process. Widely known as cholesterol-lowering compounds, plant sterols are currently approved by regulatory agencies (FDA, EFSA) as food ingredients. Plant sterols, stanols, and their esters are nutritionally relevant nutrients because of their abilities to reduce blood cholesterol levels via partial inhibition of intestinal cholesterol absorption, to inhibit the growth of cancer cells, enhance the immune response, and act as anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant factors [

Free sterols are the physiologically active form, known for their cholesterol-lowering properties made possible by inhibition of cholesterol absorption in the small intestine. The stanols and sterols esterified to phenolic acids present in corn are mostly hydrolyzed in the intestine. Steryl ferulates and hydroxycinnamate esters, are chain-breaking antioxidants and have proven cholesterol-lowering properties [
