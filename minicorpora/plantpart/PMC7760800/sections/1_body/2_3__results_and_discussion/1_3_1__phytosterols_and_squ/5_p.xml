<p>Results obtained on post-fermentation corn oil show that plant sterols are present at considerable levels in this side stream. Compared to a commercial corn oil, one of the richest sources of phytosterols among vegetable oils, with as high as 0.7â€“0.8%

 <xref rid="B22-foods-09-01788" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], post-fermentation corn oil showed much higher sterol levels. This is due to the fact that while a commercial corn oil originates from the germ fraction, post-fermentation corn oil derives from the whole kernel and therefore retains the whole set of phytosterols, phytostanols, and their ferulate esters highly present in the aleurone, pericarp, and endosperm fractions. Moreover, the ethanol produced during fermentation acts as an extractant of sterols and other fat-soluble compounds from the whole fermenting mass, including yeast cells, as evident from the presence of ergosterol, the prevalent sterol in the cell membranes of yeasts, virtually absent in corn. Phytosterol and squalene contents in the different lots examined showed a low variability (CV &lt; 15%), indicating a stable quality of the feedstock and standardized process conditions in the bioethanol plant over the period of study.
