<p>Thin stillage is a liquid stream generated in large amounts by the corn dry grind ethanol industry after centrifugation of heavy stillage. Although the majority of undissolved solids are removed with centrifugation, thin stillage still contains, along with a large part of water (90–93%), a residual lipid fraction quantified in the range 1.5–2.3% [

The HPLC profile of the unsaponifiable lipid fraction components of thin stillage extracts has shown a qualitative profile comparable to that of corn oil. Chromatographic analyses were performed after saponification. The sterol profile of thin stillage extracts is reported in
