<p>Analyses carried out before and after oil saponification allowed the quantification of free and total sterols released after hydrolysis of esters with fatty acids or phenolic acids. The sum of the identified free sterols in direct analysis of corn oil ranged from about 5700 to 8383 mg kg
 <sup>−1</sup> in the lots examined. These values more than doubled after saponification (15832–17912 mg kg
 <sup>−1</sup>), indicating that at least 50% of the sterols was in bound form.
