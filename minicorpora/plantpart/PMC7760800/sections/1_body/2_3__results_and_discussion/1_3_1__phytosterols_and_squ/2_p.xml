<p>Beta-sitosterol, sitostanol, campesterol + stigmasterol and ergosterol were the sterols identified, based on the comparison with pure standards for retention time and UV spectra characteristics. Peak identity was confirmed in the LC-MS/MS system by comparing the retention time and ionization and fragmentation pattern with those of pure standards. A sterol eluting in correspondence of the retention time of brassicasterol was tentatively identified as Î´-5-avenasterol based on LC-MS/MS data, UV spectrum, and literature indications [
