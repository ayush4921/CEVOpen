<p>Beta-sitosterol was the most abundant sterol in corn oil, with values as high as 6742–7652 mg kg
 <sup>−1</sup> after saponification (corresponding to 42.3–47.4% of total sterols). Sitostanol, the saturated equivalent of sitosterol, was detected at very low amounts in free form (529–739 mg kg
 <sup>−1</sup>) while after saponification resulted to be the second most abundant sterol (3134–4829 mg kg
 <sup>−1</sup>, correspondent to 19.8–27.8% of total sterols). This is an indication that sitostanol is mostly present in post-fermentation corn oil in esterified form, in line with the literature on the sterol profile of corn, indicating stanols as highly present in endosperm and bran mainly as ferulate esters [

 <sup>−1</sup>, 13.4–15.4% of total sterols) and the sterol tentatively identified as δ-5-avenasterol (2066–2796 mg kg
 <sup>−1</sup>, 12.9–15.7% of total sterols) were present in significant amounts in the saponified extract, about half of which in free form. Ergosterol, not inherently present in corn, but essential component of yeast cells membrane, was presumably found in corn oil as a result of the fermentation process. Its levels, ranging from 259 to 461 mg kg
 <sup>−1</sup> (corresponding to 1.7–2.4% of total sterols) were not affected by saponification, meaning that this sterol is present mostly in free form. Squalene was present in corn oil at concentrations corresponding to 745–940 mg kg
 <sup>−1</sup>.
