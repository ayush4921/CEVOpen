<p>Besides retaining vitamin E activity and playing as potent antioxidants, tocols cover multiple functions in biological systems such as gene expression regulation, signal transduction, and modulation of cell functions through modulation of protein–membrane interactions [

While most of the studies on vitamin E have been first focused on α-tocopherol, the primary form in most living organisms, further evidences have shown that its homologues have superior biological properties that may be useful for prevention and therapy against chronic diseases [

Most recently, tocotrienols have raised increasing interest because of their hypocholesterolemic, neuroprotective, anti-thrombotic, and anti-tumor effects, suggesting that they may serve as effective agents in the prevention and/or treatment of cancer and cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases [

The enrichment of food products with natural extracts rich of tocols and other natural antioxidants and bioactives is the best strategy to ensure that daily requirements are met and at the same time to improve the healthiness and oxidative stability of processed food [
