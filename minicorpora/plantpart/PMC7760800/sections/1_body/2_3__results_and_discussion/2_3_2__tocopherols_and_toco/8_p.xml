<p>The tocol profile of thin stillage and the average and standard deviation of values detected in the different lots after saponification of lipid extracts are reported in 
 <xref rid="foods-09-01788-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. The amounts are expressed both on a wet mass and dry matter basis. Because of its high dilution, in absolute terms thin stillage has a very low concentration of tocols (average value 20.9 mg kg
 <sup>−1</sup> thin stillage). As observed for post-fermentation corn oil, the tocol profile of thin stillage was characterized by the presence of tocopherols (73%) dominating over tocotrienols (27%), with γ-homologues prevailing over α- and δ- homologues a. The relative proportions of each tocopherol and tocotrienol homologue identified in post-fermentation corn oil and thin stillage were quite similar, as can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-foods-09-01788">Figure S2</xref>. As observed for phytosterols, in absolute terms, the tocol amounts in thin tillage on a wet mass basis were very low compared to post-fermentation corn oil.
