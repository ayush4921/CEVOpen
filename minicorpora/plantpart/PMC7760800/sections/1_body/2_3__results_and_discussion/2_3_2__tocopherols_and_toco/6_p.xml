<p>Values detected in the different lots examined showed quite stable tocol contents and a low variability (CV &lt; 15%), indicating standardized process conditions in the bioethanol plant over the time and a resistance of tocols to the fuel ethanol production conditions. The prevalence of γ-homologues of tocopherols and tocotrienols over α- and δ-homologues here observed is a characteristic feature of corn that may be of interest for final applications [
