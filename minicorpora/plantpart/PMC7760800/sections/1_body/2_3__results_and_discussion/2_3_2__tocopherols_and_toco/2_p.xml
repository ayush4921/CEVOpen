<p>Tocols in post-fermentation corn oil were found to be present mostly in their free form, as evidenced by the comparison of levels obtained before and after saponification. Gamma-tocotrienol in direct analysis of corn oil coeluted with one or more unidentified compounds not present in the saponified extract, probably one or more different sterol esters, as evidenced by the analysis of peak spectra characteristics and purity. This coelution did not allow to quantify the amount of free Î³-tocotrienol and hence the total amounts of free tocotrienols and free tocols.</p>
