<p>Post-fermentation corn oil was characterized by the prevalence of tocopherols (981 ± 42.3 mg kg
 <sup>−1</sup>, corresponding to 72% of total tocols) over tocotrienols (379 ± 33 mg kg
 <sup>−1</sup>, corresponding to 28% of total tocols), with γ-tocopherol prevailing over α- and δ- homologues, as typical for corn [

 <xref rid="B35-foods-09-01788" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The levels of γ-tocopherol after saponification accounted for an average value of 742 mg kg
 <sup>−1</sup>, followed by α-tocopherol (216 mg kg
 <sup>−1</sup>) and very minor amounts of δ-tocopherol (22.4 mg kg
