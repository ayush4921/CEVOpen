 <xref rid="foods-09-01788-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. Analyses carried out before and after oil saponification allowed the quantification of free and total tocols released after ester hydrolysis. The coelution of β- and γ-homologues of tocopherols and tocotrienols, common in reversed-phase LC systems, is of no relevance in the case of corn, where β-homologues of tocopherols and tocotrienols are known to be absent or negligible [
