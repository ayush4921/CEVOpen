0: With a circular economy approach the bio-molecules present in corn ethanol side streams, phytosterols, phenolics, tocols, squalene, and carotenoids, retaining health protective properties (i.e., antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-aging) could be recovered and valorized by their reintroduction in productive processes as functional ingredients of high-value products (food, nutraceutics, cosmetics).
1: The first step to succeed in this objective is to gather detailed information of the chemical composition of the side streams.
2: In a previous paper we have described the proximate composition, mineral content, and fatty acid profile of bioethanol post-fermentation corn oil and thin stillage [ 11].
