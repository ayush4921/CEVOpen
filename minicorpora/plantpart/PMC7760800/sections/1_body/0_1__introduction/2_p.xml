<p>To increase the competitiveness and sustainability of biofuels with respect to fossil fuels, a significant reduction of their production costs is necessary. A promising approach is the valorization of co-products and side streams arising from biofuels production and the maximization of the biomass-to-products value chains by creating biofuel-driven biorefineries.</p>
