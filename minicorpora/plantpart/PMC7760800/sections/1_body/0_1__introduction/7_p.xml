<p>Corn, the most common feedstock for bioethanol production in Europe, is inherently rich of bioactive phytochemicals, i.e., plant sterols, tocopherols, tocotrienols, phenolic compounds, and carotenoids [
 <xref rid="B10-foods-09-01788" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These bioactives withstand the industrial processes of fuel ethanol production and may be found in the side streams together with yeast residues and metabolites resulting from the fermentation process. The dry-grind corn bioethanol production process gives two side streams, post-fermentation corn oil and thin stillage, currently not fully valorized. Post-fermentation corn oil, obtained by centrifugation of corn syrup, may be utilized for bio-diesel production. However, its full potentialities are actually unexploited since molecules other than fatty acids, reported to hinder the efficiency of biodiesel production, remain unused, while could first be recovered and conveyed to high-end applications.
