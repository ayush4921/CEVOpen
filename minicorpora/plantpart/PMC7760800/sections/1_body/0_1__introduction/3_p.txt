0: Ethanol biorefineries are essential drivers of the energy transition, as they convert biomass into low-carbon fuels and also into a range of other valuable low-carbon co-products that may be conveyed to new value chains.
1: Bioethanol production is mainly provided by first-generation biorefineries, with corn as the major feedstock [ 3].
2: The recovery of valuable compounds from corn bio-ethanol co-products and their application as ingredients for high-value market products, may open opportunities for the creation of new bio-based value chains.
3: This approach is in line with the principles of circular economy, aiming at ensuring high quality, functional, and safe products to all, while reducing carbon and environmental footprints [ 4, 5].
4: Although the present work has been conducted in the framework of the European Unions Horizon 2020-BBI-JU Program (Project EXConsEED, GA n. 792054), the approach proposed has a global interest, with a high potential impact for the big ethanol producers outside Europe, especially United States, a key player in corn bioethanol production.
