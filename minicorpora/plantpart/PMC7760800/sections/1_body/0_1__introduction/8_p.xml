<p>Thin stillage, obtained after centrifugation of thick/whole stillage, is a highly diluted stream containing suspended particles and dissolved nutrients that originate from spent corn grains and yeast cells in bioethanol biorefineries. Currently, its main use in the feed sector mixed to distillerâ€™s dried grains with solubles (DDGS) requires high energy-demanding evaporation steps that reduce the economic sustainability of the whole biotech process.</p>
