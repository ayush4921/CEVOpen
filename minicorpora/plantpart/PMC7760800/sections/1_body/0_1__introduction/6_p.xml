<p>First-generation biofuel biorefineries may be a starting point for new bio-based value chains. Their by-products and side streams still retain a series of valuable bioactive compounds that, if properly recovered and valorized, may open new perspectives for integrated biorefinery systems with the concomitant result of increasing the competitiveness and maximizing the efficiency of the biofuel production process.</p>
