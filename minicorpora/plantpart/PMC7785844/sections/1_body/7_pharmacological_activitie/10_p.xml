 <italic>S. dulcificum</italic> fruit extract in xanthine oxidase and monosodiumurate (MSU)-treated RAW264.7 macrophages has been reported (
 <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Shi et al., 2016</xref>). Xanthine oxidase mediates the production of uric acid. In mammals, uric acid resulting from the action of xanthine oxidase is catabolised to allantoin hennce inhibition of xanthine oxidase will directly inhibit uric acid formation. In the study conducted on potassium salt-induced hyperuricaemic mice, butanol extract of 
 <italic>S. dulcificum</italic> fruits mitigated the elevated serum uric acid in induced animals. Butanol extract also inhibited xanthine oxidase activity in monosodium urate (MSU)-treated RAW264.7 macrophages (
