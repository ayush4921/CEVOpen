 <italic>S. dulcificum</italic> berry and stem extracts on colorectal cancer cells (HCT-116, HT-29) and its effect on the expression of early apoptotic genes, c-fos and c-jun have also been investigated (
 <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Seong et al., 2018</xref>). The genes, c-fos and c-jun, encode for proteins called activator protein-1 (AP-1) that belong to the class of transcription factors associated with cell functions such as cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis (
