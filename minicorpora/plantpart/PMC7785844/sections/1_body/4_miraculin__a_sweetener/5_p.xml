The result shows that acceptability rate increased when pretreated with 0.3–0.5 mg miraculin. The nerve response to acid was doubled as compared to sucrose response after pretreatment with miraculin. The duration of miraculin effect was established to be an hour and it vanishes gradually within 20 min. The result established that miraculin amplified the sweet-sensing cells sensitivity to acid. Another study investigated the brain mechanism of the sweet taste elicited from the consumption of miracle fruit that is, how the fruit converts the sour taste of acids to sweet and appetizing taste. Recording of human cerebral cortex using magnetic fields to monitor the sweet taste elicited by miracle fruit was performed. In the report, the preliminary taste responses were limited to the fronto-parietal cortex described as the brain site that received neuronal signal for taste. The response latency of sucrose and citric acid, after mastication of miracle fruit, was shown to be equivalent whereas there was a large difference (250–300 ms) between sucrose and citric acid in the absence of the fruit. The sour taste vanishes at the subcortical level while the sweet taste neuronal signal gets to the cortical level. In another study, the molecular mechanism of miraculin was unravelled by examining the main taste receptor affected by the compound. Miraculin binds to the epithelial plasma membrane of the receptor taste receptor type 1 member 3 (T1R2-T1R3) and acts as antagonist in any sour solution. The experiment shows that miraculin only exhibits the effect on its receptor in an acidic pH and shift between the two receptors (
