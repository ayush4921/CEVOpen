<p id="p0105">Phytochemicals such as alkaloids, glycosides, flavonoids, volatile oils, tannins, and resins have been employed for a wide range of industrial and commercial applications such as medicine, cosmetics, flavors, preservatives and natural pigment. Several reports on the phytochemicals of 
 <italic>S. dulcificum</italic> have documented different compounds (
 <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Vikram et al., 2014</xref>). Thirteen bioconstituents were identified in the methanol extract of 
 <italic>S. dulcificum</italic> stem using spectroscopic techniques (
 <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2011</xref>)
 <italic>.</italic> The compounds include dihydro-feruloyl-5-methoxytyramine; (+)-syringaresinol, (+)-epi-syringaresinol, 4-acetonyl-3,5- dimethoxy-p-quinol, cis-p-coumaric acid, trans-pcoumaric acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, syringic acid, vanillic acid, veratric acid, N-cis-feruloyltyramine, N-trans-feruloyltyramine, and N-cis-caffeoyltyramine (

 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Cheng et al., 2015</xref>) reported six pure compounds namely, propane-1,2,3-triol; 2,5-dimethoxyphenol; 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoic acid; nicotinic acid; β-sitosterol, and stigmasterol from the methanol extract of the plant stem. The isolated compounds, (+)-epi-syringaresinol and (+)-syringaresinol were reported to possess anti-aging and anti-oxidative activities and the potential to inhibit human skin cancer cells 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Correspondingly, (+)-epi-syringaresinol, 4-acetonyl-3,5-dimethoxy-p-quinol, trans-p-coumaric acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, cis-p-coumaric acid, vanillic acid, and N-cis-feruloyltyramine reduce mushroom tyrosinase activity, hence have an unlimited potential to inhibit melanin synthesis and conversely used in hyper-pigmentation treatment. Likewise, β-sitosterol and stigmasterol exhibit anti-inflammatory, antineoplastic, antipyretic and immuno-modulating activity in animal (

 <italic>S. dulcificum</italic> show potential applications in medical cosmetology and food supplementation.
