 <italic>S. dulcificum</italic> is an extraordinary and outstanding shrub due to its outstanding pharmacological and nutritional values. Different parts of the plant are useful for industrial and therapeutic purposes. The plant is listed as one of commercially important African medicinal plants with high potential as a food and nutritional supplement (

The miracle fruit plant has potential anticancer, antioxidant, anticovulsant, antihyperuricemia and cholesterol-lowering properties among others. In particular, miraculin has great nutritional and therapeutic benefits as a low-calorie sweetner and an andiabetic agent. Other significant components which are not yet detected may be present in the plant. This calls for continuing investigations. Known components should be standardized and proper safety evaluations performed to enhance acceptability of products from the plant in more countries. Drug development from the plant for the management of diabetes and diabetic complications are potentially viable areas of focus. In addition, synthesis of analogues of miraculin with comparable or better activity should be explored which can aid in the conservation of this species. The miracle plant offers a vast library of bioactive compounds and more pharmacological activities of the plant are likely to emerge in the coming years. For example, the plant is used ethnomedically to treat sexually-related diseases but pharmacological study along this line is absent or scanty. There is every reason to believe that the miracle fruit plant still has a yet untapped benefits for man.
