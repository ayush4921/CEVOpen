<p id="p0065">The proximate mineral analysis of the fruit pulp showed the presence of Ca (100 ppm), Fe (24.20 ppm), Zn (9.49 ppm), Cu (6.22 ppm), Cr (0.01 ppm) and Co (0.01 ppm) with no lead detected (

 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Nkwocha et al. (2014b)</xref> reported a high amount of flavonoids (57.01%) in Miracle fruit. Essential and non-essential amino acids were also reported present including tryptophan (8.06%), histidine (0.4%), isoleucine (0.7%), leucine (0.6%), lysine (0.6%), methionine (1.05%), phenylalanine (0.7%), threonine (1.1%), and valine (0.69%). The marker compound of the fruit ‘‘miraculin’’ consisted of sugars (glucosamine, mannose, fucose, xylose, and galactose), nitrogen, carbohydrates, and nearly 191 amino acid residues (

 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Guney and Nawar (1977)</xref> studied the lipid contents of 
 <italic>S. dulcificum</italic> seed and reported that there lipid types in the seed namely neutral lipids (90.8 %), glycolipids (7.3 %) and phospholipids (3.16 %) fractions. According to their findings, the phospholipid fraction consisted of phosphatidyl ethanolamine, phosphatidyl choline and phosphatidyl inositol. On the other hand, the glycolipids in the seed include monogalactosyl diglyceride, digalactosyl diglyceride and cerebrosides in different proportions. Also, the neutral lipids include triglycerides, diglycerides, monoglycerides, free fatty acids and an unsaponifiable material which was revealed using thin-layer chromatographic technique.
