<p>The flower colors are mainly white, yellow-green, or pink which are developed in branched inflorescences. These inflorescences are borne on pedunculate axillary racemes or umbels which are on pedicles 3–7 mm long. The fruits are globose to ellipsoidal drupes about 3 cm long, 2.5 cm thick, glabrous, greenish when young, become yellowish (or rarely orange-red) when ripe, contain a juicy pulp, and 1 seed. Its seed is woody, light yellow, up to 1.5 cm long, 1.2 cm thick with a fatty kernel, and a brittle shell.
