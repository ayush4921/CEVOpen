 <caption> Antinociceptive effect of an aqueous extract (31.6−316 mg/kg) and an essential oil (30−177 µg/paw) from B. heterophylla in the formalin test in mice. ( A) AUC from the time course curve of phase 1 and AUC from the time course curve of phase 2. VEH: vehicle (0.9% saline solution). DIC (50 mg/kg, p.o.). ( B) AUC from the time course curve of phase 1 and AUC from the time course curve of phase 2. VEH: vehicle (0.9% saline solution). DIC: (100 µg/paw, i.pl.). Each measurement represents the mean ± SEM 6 mice per group. Significantly different from VEH group (* p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01, *** p &lt; 0.001) determined by ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s post hoc test. </caption>
