0: One of the medicinal species used in Capulalpam de Mendez for painful and inflammation disorders is  Baccharis heterophylla Kunth (Asteraceae), a plant widely distributed in Mexico; the aerial parts of this species are consumed in the form of infusions, decoctions, or poultices [ 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].
1: Baccharis heterophylla is known as chamizo de barrer, curacuata, jarakatua, and hierba de la mula; among others, and it is also employed widely outside Oaxaca for treating painful complaints.
2: Phytochemical investigations of an exudate from  B. heterophylla recollected in a not specified location of Oaxaca, Mexico, led to the isolation of different types of secondary metabolites, including flavonoids such as apigenin, genkwanin, and naringenin [ 11], two triterpenes, oleanolic acid, and maniladiol [ 11, 12], a few sesquiterpenoids and two dimeric clerodanes [ 13].
3: Previous pharmacological studies have shown that the CHCl 3MeOH (1:1) extract of  B. heterophylla produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of spontaneous ileum contractions and activated Ca 2+-dependent chloride channels in  Xenopus laevis oocytes [ 6, 14].
4: However, the species efficacy to treat painful complaints, chemical analysis to determine the major compounds of the traditional preparation, and to establish identity and composition tests remain open questions
