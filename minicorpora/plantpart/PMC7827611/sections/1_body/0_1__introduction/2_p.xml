<p>For instituting knowledge-based herbal traditional medicines, whose use is founded on the experience, it is necessary to determine their safety and efficacy using preclinical and clinical assays. When assessing medicinal plantsâ€™ efficacy, it is crucial to analyze the traditional remedies and their constituents (e.g., flavonoids, terpenoids, phenylpropanoids, alkaloids, or others), considering that usually the efficacy is accomplished with the mixtures of compounds in these preparations. The mixture of compounds might be acting by synergistic multi-target effects, improving pharmacokinetic parameters or other mechanisms. For quality control of these herbals drugs is important to establish a physicochemical evaluation of crude drug covering aspects, such as selection, macro, and microscopic examination, for detection of the right material, and search of adulterants; qualitative chemical evaluation for identification of single, or a set of constituents (active or not) using chromatography or other analytical procedures; and, finally, quantitative chemical evaluation to estimate the amount of the major classes or constituents, active or not. The processes mentioned involve a wide array of scientific investigations, including physical, chemical, and biological evaluations employing different analytical methods and tools. Altogether, these studies can lead to the development of standardized phytomedicines of good quality [
