<p>In the present study, chlorogenic and di-caffeoylquinic acids were selected as markers for the quantitative analysis of 
 <italic>B. heterophylla</italic>. The optimal chromatographic separation was achieved with a Waters HPLC equipped with an XBridge BEH Shield RP18 column and a mixture of water containing 0.1% formic acid and acetonitrile as mobile phase, which was chosen after several trials; the PDA detection wavelength (λ) was set at 327 nm; under these optimized conditions, an effective resolution was achieved for compounds 
 <bold>1</bold>–
 <bold>4</bold>. Compounds 
 <bold>1</bold>–
 <bold>4</bold> were identified by their retention time and coelution with AE; a representative chromatogram of the AE of 
 <italic>B. heterophylla</italic> (BH-1) is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00116-f004">Figure 4</xref>. The developed method was validated using compounds 
 <bold>1</bold>, 
 <bold>3</bold> and 
 <bold>4</bold> according to the International Conference on Harmonization guideline (ICH) [
 <xref rid="B37-plants-10-00116" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], and was successfully applied to determine the content of caffeoylquinic acids in AE prepared from different batches of the plant. The overall results are summarized in
