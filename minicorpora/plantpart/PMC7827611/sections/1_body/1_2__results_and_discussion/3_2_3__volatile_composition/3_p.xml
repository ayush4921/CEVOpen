<p>For the HS-SPME analysis, four fibers were employed, carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane (CAR/PDMS), divinylbenzene/carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane (DVB/CAR/PDMS), polydimethylsiloxane/divinylbenzene (PDMS/DVB), and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). As summarized in 
 <xref rid="plants-10-00116-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, the analysis with these fibers allowed the identification of 13, 13, 14, and 14 compounds, respectively; their relative percentages and retention indexes are also indicated in 
 <xref rid="plants-10-00116-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. β-Pinene, D-limonene, and myrcene were the major components detected with DVB/CAR/PDMS and CAR/PDMS stationary phases; this composition is consistent with the main compounds detected in EO. On the other hand, cedrene and β-caryophyllene were the most abundant compounds detected with PDMS and PDMS/DVB-coat fibers.
