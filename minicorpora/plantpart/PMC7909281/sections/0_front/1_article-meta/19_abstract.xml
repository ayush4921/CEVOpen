 <p>The granary weevil 
  <italic>Sitophilus granarius</italic> is a stored product pest found worldwide. Environmental damages, human health issues and the emergence of resistance are driving scientists to seeks alternatives to synthetic insecticides for its control. With low mammal toxicity and low persistence, essential oils are more and more being considered a potential alternative. In this study, we compare the toxicity of 25 essential oils, representing a large array of chemical compositions, on adult granary weevils. Bioassays indicated that 
  <italic>Allium sativum</italic> was the most toxic essential oil, with the lowest calculated lethal concentration 90 (LC90) both after 24 h and 7 days. 
  <italic>Gaultheria procumbens</italic>, 
  <italic>Mentha arvensis</italic> and 
  <italic>Eucalyptus dives</italic> oils appeared to have a good potential in terms of toxicity/cost ratio for further development of a plant-derived biocide. Low influence of exposure time was observed for most of essential oils. The methodology developed here offers the possibility to test a large array of essential oils in the same experimental bioassay and in a standardized way. It is a first step to the development of new biocide for alternative management strategies of stored product pests.
