<p>Since 1960, stored product pests have been mainly controlled by synthetic contact pesticides [

 <xref rid="B9-foods-10-00200" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The utilization of those pesticides is being criticized more and more. Appearance of resistance in addition to the increased risks of residues dangerous to the environment and human health have led to an increasingly restricted use of those compounds [
 <xref rid="B9-foods-10-00200" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-foods-10-00200" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These environmental concerns and demand for food safety have underlined the need for alternative research [

 <xref rid="B12-foods-10-00200" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. More particularly, essential oils also have interesting properties to replace synthetic insecticides [

 <xref rid="B14-foods-10-00200" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Isman and Grieneisen [
 <xref rid="B15-foods-10-00200" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] showed that from 1980 to 2012 the proportion of papers on botanicals among all papers on insecticides raised from 1.43% to 21.38%. Increasing interest in essential oils as an alternative to synthetic pesticides comes from their characteristics [
 <xref rid="B16-foods-10-00200" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Due to their high volatility, temperature and UV light degradation sensitivity, essential oils are less persistent in the environment than traditional pesticides [
 <xref rid="B17-foods-10-00200" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In addition, most essential oils have low mammalian toxicity in comparison with synthetic insecticides and are considered as eco-friendly [
 <xref rid="B18-foods-10-00200" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. For instance, Stroh et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-foods-10-00200" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] showed that eugenol was 1500 times less toxic than pyrethrum and 15,000 times less toxic than the organophosphate azinphosmethyl for juvenile rainbow trout based on 96 h-LC
