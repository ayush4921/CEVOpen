0: Since 1960, stored product pests have been mainly controlled by synthetic contact pesticides [ 8, 9].
1: The utilization of those pesticides is being criticized more and more.
2: Appearance of resistance in addition to the increased risks of residues dangerous to the environment and human health have led to an increasingly restricted use of those compounds [ 9, 10].
3: These environmental concerns and demand for food safety have underlined the need for alternative research [ 10, 11].
4: In the last decades, plant essential oils have been reported to be a potential alternative for many applications such as anti-microbial, antifungal or herbicide uses [ 12].
5: More particularly, essential oils also have interesting properties to replace synthetic insecticides [ 13, 14].
6: Isman and Grieneisen [ 15] showed that from 1980 to 2012 the proportion of papers on botanicals among all papers on insecticides raised from 1.43% to 21.38%.
7: Increasing interest in essential oils as an alternative to synthetic pesticides comes from their characteristics [ 16].
8: Due to their high volatility, temperature and UV light degradation sensitivity, essential oils are less persistent in the environment than traditional pesticides [ 17].
9: In addition, most essential oils have low mammalian toxicity in comparison with synthetic insecticides and are considered as eco-friendly [ 18].
10: For instance, Stroh et al.
11: [ 19] showed that eugenol was 1500 times less toxic than pyrethrum and 15,000 times less toxic than the organophosphate azinphosmethyl for juvenile rainbow trout based on 96 h-LC 50 values.
