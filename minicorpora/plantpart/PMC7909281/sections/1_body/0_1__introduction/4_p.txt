0: Nevertheless, few actual applications have emerged for the protection of stored foodstuffs and we still lack a systematic screening of potently active oils under conditions mimicking storage reality and with a standardized strain of insects.
1: The aim of our study was precisely to test and rank 25 essential oils commonly used and available on the market against  S. granarius.
2: Special care has been taken for the selection of essential oil based on a large array of chemical composition (different major compounds or groups of major compounds,  Table 1).
3: In order to remain under realistic conditions for industrial large-scale application, data as price, availability on the market or health implications has been taken into account in our discussion.
4: To allow comparison, a standardized strain of  S. granarius was used for all the test performed under the same experimental conditions.
5: Determination of essential oils toxicity has been done by treating the wheat grains directly, considering that the presence of wheat may influence results [ 35] and mostly because, in practice, it is the grain itself that will be treated in storage facilities.
