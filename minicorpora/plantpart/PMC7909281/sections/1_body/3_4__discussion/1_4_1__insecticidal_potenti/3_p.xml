 <xref rid="B47-foods-10-00200" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] as well as geraniol (main compound of 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> essential oil) [
 <xref rid="B48-foods-10-00200" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] was also been highlighted for their activities against various stored product pests. In addition, Yazdgerdian et al. [
 <xref rid="B46-foods-10-00200" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] identified 
 <italic>G. procumbens</italic> as the most toxic oil, both by fumigation (6.8 µL/L air) and contact on treated wheat (0.235µL/g), among five essential oils tested on 
 <italic>S. oryzae</italic>. These results confirm the toxicity of 
 <italic>G. procumbens</italic> observed in our study. However, although many studies highlighted toxicities of essential oils, lack of a common protocol or of major compounds description often prevent from reliable and univocal comparison. For example, in the study of Teke et al. [
 <xref rid="B49-foods-10-00200" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] the fennel essential oils applied on 
 <italic>S. granarius</italic> contains 71.64% of estragol, which closely resembles the composition of the basil oil in our study (73.43% estragol). However, in their case they realized topical application without grain presence which is quite different that in our case.
