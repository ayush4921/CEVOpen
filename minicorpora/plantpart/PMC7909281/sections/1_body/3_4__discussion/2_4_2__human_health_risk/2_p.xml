 <italic>Gaultheria procumbens</italic> which showed the second highest acute toxicity to 
 <italic>S. granarius</italic> is constituted at 99% of methyl salicylate, a molecule classified as moderately hazardous for human health. Because of this specific composition, this essential oil should be use in association to avoid a rapid development of resistance. Further analyses have also to be done on the persistence of methyl salicylate, on its environmental and mammal toxicity to estimate the potential of this EO as a stand-alone or mix product. Two molecules of 
 <italic>O. sanctum</italic> (eugenol and methyl eugenol) as well are classified as moderately hazardous to mammals and need to be considered with the same caution.
