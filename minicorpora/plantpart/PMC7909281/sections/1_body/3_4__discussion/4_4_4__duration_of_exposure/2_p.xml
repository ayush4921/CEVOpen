<p>For the other essential oils, little differences of mortality were observed after 1 and 7 days of exposure. Several hypotheses could explain that observation. First as mortality arise soon after the insect introduction, we may expect a strong selection effect on susceptible individuals, leaving alive after one day only more resistant individuals. Secondly, the absorption of essential oils by the grains (by fumigation or contact) could reduce the biodisponibility of the active compounds and thus the lack of efficiency on long terms period. Indeed, Lee et al. [
