<p>Mortality levels clearly varied among oils. When tested at the highest concentration of 5%, nine out of 25 essential oils provoked a mortality of less than 60% of the individuals after 24 h (ranging from 0 to 59%). We considered that this threshold must be exceeded to give sufficient efficiency in practice. In consequence, for these oils lower concentrations were not further tested. Looking at the results, it appeared that EOs listed in
