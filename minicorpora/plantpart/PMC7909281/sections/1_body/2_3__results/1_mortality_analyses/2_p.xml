<p>For the 16 remaining EOs, a positive relation was observed between mortality and concentration. Most of them showed a zero or almost zero mortality at a concentration of 1% except 
 <italic>A. sativum</italic> which still provoked 75% of mortality after 24 h at that concentration and represents therefore the most toxic oil tested. Among the remaining oil, 
 <italic>G. procumbens, O. sanctum</italic> and 
 <italic>Eucalyptus</italic> dives reached respectively 81%, 68% and 51% of mortality (24 h) for a 2% concentration (
