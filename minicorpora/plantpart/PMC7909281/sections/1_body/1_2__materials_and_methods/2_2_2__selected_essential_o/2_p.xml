<p>Essential oils have been mainly obtained from Pranarom S.A. (7822—Ghislenghien, Belgium) as well as their composition. Only 
 <italic>Ocimum sanctum</italic> essential oil has been purchased from “Herb and tradition” S.A company (CP59560—Comines, France) and was analyzed by GC-MS. List of the essential oils tested and their composition is indicated in 
 <xref rid="foods-10-00200-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The GC-MS used for EOs characterization was a Hewlett Packard system (HP Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA) in splitless injection mode system, with a HP INNOWAX column of 60 m, 0.25 mm of diameter and 0.5 µm of film thickness. The initial temperature of 50 °C was maintained for 6 min before a progressive warming of 2 °C per minute up to 250 °C. Once the temperature peak of 250 °C was reached, it has been maintained for 20 min. The injector and interface temperature were 250 °C whereas that of the source was 230 °C. The gas vector was helium at a pressure of 23 psi and the total ion chromatogram was recorded by using an electron-impact source at 70 eV of ion kinetic energy. The compound identification was made by comparison of the spectra to National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) spectral library and pure commercial standards injection in the same chromatographic conditions.
