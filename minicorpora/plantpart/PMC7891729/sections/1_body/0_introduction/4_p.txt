0: Local knowledge and use of plants are assessed through different ethnobotanical methods, of which the interview is the most widely used.
1: Interview methods vary considerably between studies and are deployed based on the research question addressed [ 26].
2: Freelisting is a frequently used interview method, in which informants are asked to list all items they know within a given domain [ 27,  28].
3: This technique reveals cultural salience and variations in individuals topical knowledge [ 29], and results in a shortlist of highly valued plants [ 30,  31].
4: As freelisting enables the collection of data from a large number of informants in a limited amount of time [ 32], this method is frequently used as a starting point for studying traditional plant knowledge.
5: Local names of plants listed during the freelisting interviews are identified afterwards by collecting voucher specimens for these names.
6: The resulting dataset is then used to draw conclusions about plant knowledge by a certain group of people and/or the potential contribution of wild plants to their diet [ 30,  33].
7: Organizing field trips to collect herbarium specimens of species mentioned during freelisting exercises is often (inaccurately) called the walk-in-the-woods method [ 34,  35].
8: However, this technique, first coined by Phillips and Gentry in 1993 [ 36], implies that participants are encouraged to actively lead field trips and point out all useful plants they know and/or use [ 26], instead of only helping the researcher search for specimens that can be linked to the local names mentioned during interviews.
9: Data elicited from freelisting appear to be specific to the context in which they were collected (e.g., in the village), creating an unintended but significant bias in this type of ethnobotanical research [ 27,  32,  37].
10: Gathering the data during  ex-situ interviews, for example in peoples home, away from the ecological context in which people collect their plants, may result in lists of only the most salient plant species.
11: Furthermore, the success of freelisting depends on the informants correct understanding of the category or cultural domain (e.g., wild food plants) under discussion [ 28,  29,  38].
