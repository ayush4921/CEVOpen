<p>In societies that undergo rapid socio-economic changes, people become more integrated into the market economy, change their lifestyle and adopt cultivated or processed substitutes for wild plants in their diet [
 <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. This creates a gap between people’s ethnobotanical knowledge and their actual use of plants [
 <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. A discrepancy between the number of useful species known and those actually used indicates that elders who still know how plants were used in the past do not practice this any longer, and infrequently transfer their skills to the next generation [
 <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Freelisting exercises often focus on people’s knowledge [
 <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], while recall surveys, developed by social anthropologists for understanding time allocation [
 <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], lead informants to enumerate what they have done during a specific period of time. For instance, dietary recall surveys have been developed to estimate the proportion of different food items in people’s diet [
 <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Recently, dietary recalls were introduced in ethnobotanical studies to assess local uses of plants [
 <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], while income recall surveys have been used to assess the contribution of the sale of different forest products to local livelihoods [
 <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Although many studies reported a high diversity of wild edible plant species worldwide [
 <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], research relying on dietary recalls has resulted in surprisingly low numbers of wild species actually being consumed [
 <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Dietary recalls carried out in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) also showed that wild plants did not contribute substantially to rural and urban women diets [
 <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Likewise, the dietary recalls that we recently held among the Baka reported only 15 wild edible species [
 <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], which is much less than the list provided recently in the northern Congo area [
 <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] and in stark contrast to the extensive wild plant knowledge documented almost three decades earlier by anthropologists among the same ethnic group [
 <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Like freelisting, dietary recalls are limited by the subject’s memory [
 <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] and may therefore underreport plant use.
