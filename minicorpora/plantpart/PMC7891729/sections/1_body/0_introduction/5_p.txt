0: In societies that undergo rapid socio-economic changes, people become more integrated into the market economy, change their lifestyle and adopt cultivated or processed substitutes for wild plants in their diet [ 39].
1: This creates a gap between peoples ethnobotanical knowledge and their actual use of plants [ 40,  41].
2: A discrepancy between the number of useful species known and those actually used indicates that elders who still know how plants were used in the past do not practice this any longer, and infrequently transfer their skills to the next generation [ 40].
3: Freelisting exercises often focus on peoples knowledge [ 40], while recall surveys, developed by social anthropologists for understanding time allocation [ 42], lead informants to enumerate what they have done during a specific period of time.
4: For instance, dietary recall surveys have been developed to estimate the proportion of different food items in peoples diet [ 43].
5: Recently, dietary recalls were introduced in ethnobotanical studies to assess local uses of plants [ 44,  45], while income recall surveys have been used to assess the contribution of the sale of different forest products to local livelihoods [ 46].
6: Although many studies reported a high diversity of wild edible plant species worldwide [ 47,  48], research relying on dietary recalls has resulted in surprisingly low numbers of wild species actually being consumed [ 49,  50].
7: Dietary recalls carried out in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) also showed that wild plants did not contribute substantially to rural and urban women diets [ 51].
8: Likewise, the dietary recalls that we recently held among the Baka reported only 15 wild edible species [ 52], which is much less than the list provided recently in the northern Congo area [ 53] and in stark contrast to the extensive wild plant knowledge documented almost three decades earlier by anthropologists among the same ethnic group [ 2,  3].
9: Like freelisting, dietary recalls are limited by the subjects memory [ 54] and may therefore underreport plant use.
