<p>The Baka are Ubangian-speaking forager-horticulturalists, formerly referred to as ‘Pygmies’ [
 <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Until roughly 50 years ago, they were nomadic foragers who relied on hunting, fishing, gathering, and the exchange of NTFPs for agricultural crops with their neighbors, Bantu-speaking farmers [

Due to missionary activities and a government program of sedentarization, they have progressively left their forest camps and settled in villages along logging roads [

The settlement programs, which included displacement from protected areas and forced sedentarization, have had drastic effects on Baka livelihood and wellbeing. Increased alcohol abuse, the loss of traditional knowledge, and an increasing destabilization of their natural environment have led to the marginalization of the Baka and their increased dependence on other ethnic groups [
