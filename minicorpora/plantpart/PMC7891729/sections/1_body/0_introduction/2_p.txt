0: Although the value of local ecological knowledge for informing conservation and environmental management is well established [ 15 17] and there is a general positive association between tree cover and dietary diversity [ 18], the complex biocultural interactions between tropical forest food resources and the communities they sustain are still understudied [ 10,  19].
1: According to Ngome et al.
2: [ 20], in most poor communities in the Congo Basin, the wide variety of nutrient-rich, wild edible plants are underutilized, either due to ignorance, shame or misconceptions about these foods.
3: Ethnobotanical studies have so far insufficiently provided evidence for the intake, quality and nutritional impacts of WEPs, their contribution to the overall diet and their role in ensuring food security [ 20].
4: Considering the increasing conflicts of interests regarding the use of wild resources, accurate assessments of local uses and dependency on wild plants and animals are necessary to evaluate the effects of commercial forest exploitation on both biodiversity and local livelihoods.
5: The aim of this research was to explore the diversity of wild edible plants known and used by the forest-dwelling Baka people in southeast Cameroon.
6: We also evaluated the frequency of their consumption, potential conflicts between local diet and commercial trade in forest resources, and the different field methods to assess of WEP knowledge and consumption.
