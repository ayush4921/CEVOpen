0: The Baka are Ubangian-speaking forager-horticulturalists, formerly referred to as Pygmies [ 21].
1: Until roughly 50 years ago, they were nomadic foragers who relied on hunting, fishing, gathering, and the exchange of NTFPs for agricultural crops with their neighbors, Bantu-speaking farmers [ 22].
2: Since the 1960s, the Baka have been facing several changes in their livelihood.
3: Due to missionary activities and a government program of sedentarization, they have progressively left their forest camps and settled in villages along logging roads [ 23].
4: Nowadays, Baka livelihood is mostly based on the combination of foraging activities, agricultural work in their own fields and wage labor on Bantu farms or for logging companies [ 22].
5: The settlement programs, which included displacement from protected areas and forced sedentarization, have had drastic effects on Baka livelihood and wellbeing.
6: Increased alcohol abuse, the loss of traditional knowledge, and an increasing destabilization of their natural environment have led to the marginalization of the Baka and their increased dependence on other ethnic groups [ 24,  25].
7: To evaluate the Bakas reliance on their surrounding forests in the current situation, it is essential to assess not only their knowledge on wild food plants, but also their actual use and commercialization of these species.
