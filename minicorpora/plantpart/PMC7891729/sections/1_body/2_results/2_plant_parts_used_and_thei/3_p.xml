<p>To accompany this starchy basis, the Baka prepared a stew in which leafy vegetables and condiments were combined with a fatty basis, mostly obtained from forest seeds. Fruits of 
 <italic>Irvingia</italic> spp., 
 <italic>Baillonella toxisperma</italic> and 
 <italic>Panda oleosa</italic> were gathered from the ground and the kernels were taken out. Most seeds were prepared in a similar way: the kernels were dried and/or roasted, and then pounded and/or ground to a powder that was mixed into the stew. Seeds could also be conserved for some time in the form of a pressed, oily cake. Leaves were either cut into thin slices (e.g., 
 <italic>Gnetum</italic> cf. 
 <italic>africanum</italic>) or pounded in a mortar (e.g., 
 <italic>Hilleria latifolia</italic>) and added to the stew. Condiments were grated (
 <italic>Afrostyrax lepidophyllus</italic> bark), dried (
 <italic>Aframomum</italic> spp. seeds), or roasted and crushed (seeds of 
 <italic>Ricinodendron heudelotii</italic> and 
 <italic>Monodora myristica</italic>) before being added to the dish.
