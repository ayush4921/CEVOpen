<p>The daily meal of the Baka was generally composed by two main dishes: a starchy basis and a stew with a fatty component, leaves, meat or fish. The carbohydrates provided by wild plants came predominantly from wild yams (
 <italic>Dioscorea</italic> spp.). The collection of these tubers required expert knowledge, as the Baka first verified whether the plant held tubers that were ready to be consumed, which in the case of 
 <italic>D</italic>. 
 <italic>semperflorens</italic> was done by examining the color of its leaves. The digging of the tubers required certain tools, like a wooden auger to remove the soil and extract the tuber without damaging it, a tool used specifically for both folk taxa of 
 <italic>D</italic>. 
 <italic>praehensilis</italic>. Once dug out, the tubers were washed and boiled. Some wild yams were only consumed occasionally as an emergency food, like ‘boli’ (
 <italic>Dioscorea</italic> sp. WTH63), of which the name was translated as ‘adulterer’, referring to the shame felt when eating this tuber. Other occasionally consumed wild tubers provided the Baka with carbohydrates, like those of 
 <italic>Palisota</italic> cf. 
 <italic>barteri</italic> and 
 <italic>Dioscoreophyllum cumminsii</italic>.
