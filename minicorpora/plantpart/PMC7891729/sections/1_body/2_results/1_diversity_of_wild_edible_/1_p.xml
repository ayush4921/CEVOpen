<p>A total of 94 folk taxa of WEP were reported during the three different 
 <italic>ex-situ</italic> interview methods and the 
 <italic>in-situ</italic> walk-in-the-woods trips, corresponding to ca. 91 species. The exact number of species is unclear, as eight vouchers could only be identified to genus level and for several West and Central African 
 <italic>Dioscorea</italic> species (wild yams), the taxonomic species delimitation is not clear [
 <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Moreover, the Baka recognize different forms within individual yam species and thus some local names refer to the same botanical taxon. In the case of 
 <italic>D</italic>. 
 <italic>minutiflora</italic>, the Baka distinguish three distinct types: ‘njàkàkà’, ‘báloko’ and ‘kuku’, all with different leaf and tuber morphology. All local and scientific names of each wild edible species, used parts, preparation methods, and the method(s) through which they were recorded are listed in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0247108.s001">S1 Table</xref>. The 91 wild edible plant species belonged to 43 different plant families, of which the best represented were Dioscoreaceae (ca. 9 species of wild yams), Irvingiaceae (8 spp.), Anacardiaceae (5 spp., including 4 species of 
 <italic>Trichoscypha</italic> fruits) and Zingiberaceae (5 spp. of 
 <italic>Aframomum</italic>). Most wild food plants were trees (46%), followed by climbers (27%) including woody lianas and non-woody vines, herbs (19%), shrubs (7%) and ferns (1%). More than half (52.1%) of the wild edible plant species collected by the Baka naturally occurred in primary forest, 31.9% in secondary forests and the rest (16%) in open vegetation. We encountered very little primary forest that was untouched by loggers: the only patch of forest that did not show signs of commercial timber harvesting was dominated by 
 <italic>Gilberiodendron dewevrei</italic>, located at ca. two hours walking distance from Le Bosquet. The selectively logged primary forest, however, contained the majority of the fruit and seed producing primary trees and lianas sought after by the Baka.
