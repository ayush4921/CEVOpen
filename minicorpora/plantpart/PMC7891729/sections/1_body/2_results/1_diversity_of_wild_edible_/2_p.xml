<p>Of the 94 folk taxa of wild food plants, 38 were reported by the Baka during the free listing exercises. Initially, 51 local names were mentioned during these interviews, but 13 of those were later excluded because they were either synonyms of Baka plant names that had already been mentioned (three names) or they referred to wild mushrooms (two names), types of honey (six names) or cultivated plants (two names). The most salient WEPs (the most frequently listed first) emerging from the freelisting (Smith index&gt; 0.1) were 
 <italic>Dioscorea burkilliana</italic>, 
 <italic>D</italic>. 
 <italic>praehensilis</italic>, 
 <italic>D</italic>. cf. 
 <italic>praehensilis</italic> (‘ba’), 
 <italic>Irvingia gabonensis</italic>, 
 <italic>Baillonella toxisperma</italic>, and 
 <italic>Panda oleosa</italic>. Of the 83 participants of the dietary recalls, 69 reported having eaten wild plants, and mentioned a total of 12 different species. Two species that emerged from the dietary recalls (
 <italic>Amaranthus dubius</italic> nd 
 <italic>Raphia</italic> sp.) were not mentioned during the freelisting.
