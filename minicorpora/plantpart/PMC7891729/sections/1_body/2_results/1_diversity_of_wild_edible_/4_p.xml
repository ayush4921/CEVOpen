<p>During our walk-in-the-woods survey, much more WEP species were reported by the 20 informants as recently eaten. Of the 82 WEP species for which we collected information on last consumption during the walk-in-the-woods survey, 26 were reported as consumed within the last month by at least one informant (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0247108.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The most recently consumed was 
 <italic>Solanum erianthum</italic>: the bitter fruits of this shrub were boiled with wild garlic bark (
 <italic>Afrostyrax lepidophyllus</italic>) and (cultivated) pepper (
 <italic>Capsicum frutescens</italic>) and taken as a hot drink to wake up in the morning. Moreover, 36 species were eaten within the last 12 months, 11 species between one and two years ago, eight species more than two years ago and one species was never eaten by any of our 20 informants (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0247108.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Of the 26 species consumed within the last month, 23 would not have surfaced from the dietary recalls only, and 16 would have been missed if only the freelisting and dietary recalls would have been carried out. These 16 edible species included two ferns (
 <italic>Pteridium aquilinum</italic> and 
 <italic>Diplazium sammatii</italic>), three spices (
 <italic>Xylopia parviflora</italic>, 
 <italic>Olax latifolia</italic> and 
 <italic>Ricinodendron heudelotti</italic>), four fruits (
 <italic>Passiflora foetida</italic>, 
 <italic>Solanum erianthum</italic>, 
 <italic>Musanga cecropioides</italic> and 
 <italic>Uapaca</italic> cf. 
 <italic>paludosa</italic>), the inner stem of 
 <italic>Laccosperma secundiflorum</italic>, three seeds (
 <italic>Sterculia oblonga</italic>, 
 <italic>Irvingia robur</italic> and 
 <italic>I</italic>. 
 <italic>wombulu</italic>), one root (
 <italic>Renealmia</italic> sp. WTH64), the potable water from the stem of 
 <italic>Tetracera</italic> sp. (WTH42) and the leaves of 
 <italic>Geophila lancistipula</italic>, eaten as a luck charm.
