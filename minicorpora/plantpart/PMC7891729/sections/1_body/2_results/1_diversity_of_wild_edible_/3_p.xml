<p>During the dietary recalls, 12 species of wild edible plants emerged, of which the most frequently eaten was 
 <italic>Gnetum</italic> cf. 
 <italic>africanum</italic> (mentioned in 50% of the interviews). The identification to species level of 
 <italic>Gnetum</italic> was difficult due to the absence of flowering material from male and female individuals during the time of our botanical survey. After 
 <italic>Gnetum</italic> leaves, the second most often consumed were bush mango kernels (Irvingiaceae spp.; 22% of the interviews), 
 <italic>Raphia</italic> palm wine (15%) and several species of wild yams (
 <italic>Dioscorea</italic> spp.; 15%). Detailed data on the contribution of WEPs to Baka diet compared to cultivated crops and store-bought food were published earlier [
