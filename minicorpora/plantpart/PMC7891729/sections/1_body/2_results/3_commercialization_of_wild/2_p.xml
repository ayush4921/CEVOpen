<p>During our forest walks, we identified six WEP of which the wood was observed as logged or said to be logged by the Baka (
 <xref rid="pone.0247108.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Three of these species were considered as vulnerable by the IUCN, but none appeared on the CITES Appendices I or II. The moabi tree (
 <italic>Baillonella toxisperma</italic>), highly valued by the Baka for their fresh fruits and seed oil, was the most sought after by the logging companies operating in Baka territory. Our informants mentioned that only trees exceeding one meter in diameter were felled, so several smaller individuals were still present. However, the extraction of large moabi trees by timber companies strongly affected the amount of fruits and seeds that remained available for the Bakaâ€™s subsistence and cash income. Another species that we observed as felled trunks was 
 <italic>Entandrophragma cylindricum</italic>, which itself was inedible, but commonly hosted edible caterpillars, an important food for the Baka. During the forest walks, we also observed several (smaller) trees cut down by the Baka themselves, mostly to obtain fresh leaves of 
 <italic>Gnetum</italic> cf. 
 <italic>africanum</italic> lianas, to harvest honey, and once to collect the bitter bark of 
 <italic>Garcinia kola</italic>, which was added to 
 <italic>Raphia</italic> palm wine as a flavoring agent.
