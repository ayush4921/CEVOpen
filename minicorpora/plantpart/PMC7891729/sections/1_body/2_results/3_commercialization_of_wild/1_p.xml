<p>During the recall exercise on general income received from sale over the 14 previous days, the Baka reported six different taxa as being sold. The most frequently commercialized NTFP was 
 <italic>Gnetum</italic> cf. 
 <italic>africanum</italic> (26% of the 114 interviews), far more than any of the other wild food plants, which were mentioned as sold in less than 5% of the interviews (seeds and oil of 
 <italic>Irvingia gabonensis</italic>, 
 <italic>Baillonella toxisperma</italic>, 
 <italic>Pentaclethra macrophylla</italic>, bark of 
 <italic>Afrostyrax lepidophyllus</italic> and the fruits of 
 <italic>Aframomum</italic> spp., indicated under the general name of ‘tondo’). During the walk-in-the-woods surveys, however, the Baka pointed out 24 different WEP species that they sold to middlemen (including the six previously mentioned), mostly in the form of fruits, seeds, or the oil from seeds. Of the 24 commercial species that appeared during the forest surveys, 13 were commonly sold on the international NTFP market (

 <italic>Aframomum</italic>: 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>sceptrum</italic>, 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>daniellii</italic>, 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>subsericum</italic> and 
 <italic>A</italic>. cf. 
 <italic>longipetiolatum</italic>. Only 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>cereum</italic> was not sold as spice to middlemen, but just consumed within the household. Of the 24 commercial species traded by the Baka, four appeared in the IUCN Red List as vulnerable and two as near threatened (
