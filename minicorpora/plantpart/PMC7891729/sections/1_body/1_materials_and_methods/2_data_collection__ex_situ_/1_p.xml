<p>All data were collected among Baka individuals of 18 years and older. We included all individuals who were present in the settlement and willing to participate. While we aimed to get a gender- and age-balanced sample, we did not exclude any potential participants. All 
 <italic>ex-situ</italic> interviews were held in the French and Baka language by the first author with the assistance of a local research assistant-interpreter.
