<p>Duplicates of voucher specimens were deposited at the National Herbarium of Cameroon (YA) and at the herbarium of Naturalis Biodiversity Center (L). A third voucher was kept at the study site to verify local names and uses with Baka villagers during group discussions. Plant identification took place at Naturalis, using Central African herbarium specimens and literature, such as the Flora of West Tropical Africa [
 <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], the Flore du Cameroun [
 <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], and monographs on the tropical African flora [
 <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. This literature was also used to verify the vegetation types in which these wild food plants occurred naturally. For species that were difficult to identify, we consulted botanical experts at Naturalis and abroad. Scientific names were updated using the online portal of Plants of the World Online [
