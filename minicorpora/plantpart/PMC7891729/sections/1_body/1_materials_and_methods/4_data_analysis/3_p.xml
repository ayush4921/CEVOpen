<p>Finally, in order to analyze conflicts between commercial timber harvesting and the availability of wild food plants for the Baka, we traced evidence of wild fruit trees felled by timber companies by counting the number of logged tree trunks along the forest trails and on logging trucks passing through the village during 14 days. We cross-referenced wild fruit trees species observed as felled logs and/or said to be cut for commercial timber with the CITES appendices [
 <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] and the IUCN Red List [
 <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] to assess their current conservation status.
