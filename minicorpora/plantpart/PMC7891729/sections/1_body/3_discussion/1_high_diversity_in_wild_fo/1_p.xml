<p>A major insight provided by this study is the high diversity of WEPs known and eaten by the Baka (94 folk taxa, 91 species). Such results are comparable to earlier ethnographic studies carried out among small forest dwelling societies in the Congo Basin [

 <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], our results show that they still know and consume a large diversity of wild edible plants. Apart from the fact that the Baka no longer processed and consumed the oil of 
 <italic>Pentaclethra macrophylla</italic>, but rather sold the seeds to middlemen who processed them elsewhere, we found little evidence for loss of knowledge or disappearing plant uses [
 <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Most wild food plants occurred in (selectively logged) primary forests, and consisted predominantly of fruits and seeds of canopy trees and lianas, underlying the importance of this ecosystem for Baka diet and culture. For their daily fat intake, the Baka depended heavily on the large fruits and seeds of the Irvingiaceae family, 
 <italic>Panda oleosa</italic> and 
 <italic>Poga oleosa</italic>. These species are typical to the Congo Basin forests, in which complex food and dispersal interactions take place between big terrestrial mammals (such as elephants) and the local flora [

 <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Many of the oily seed-producing trees in Central Africa are ecological keystone species that are crucial for the survival of local wildlife [
 <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], on which forest-dwelling groups such as the Baka rely on for meat [
