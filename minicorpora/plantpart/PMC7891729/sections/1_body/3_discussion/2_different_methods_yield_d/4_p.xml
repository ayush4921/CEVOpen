<p>During the walk-in-the-woods method, the researcher can directly exclude items pointed out by informants that fall outside the domain ‘wild edible plant’, such as fungi, animal products and cultivated plants, although the latter category can be challenging due to the presence of wild species under various degrees and types of human management and domestication [
 <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Local names listed as ‘wild edible plant’ during 
 <italic>ex-situ</italic> interviews may later, during botanical collection trips, appear to refer to domesticated crops, like the cultivated American crop species tania (
 <italic>Xanthosoma sagittifolium</italic>) and chili pepper (
 <italic>Capsicum frutescens</italic>), which were listed as wild edibles during freelisting interviews in the DRC [
 <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This was also the case in a recent study on WEP consumed by Baka south of the Dja Reserve [
 <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>], in which the domesticated crops okra (
 <italic>Abelmoschus esculentus</italic>), sorrel (
 <italic>Hibiscus sabdariffa</italic>) and chili pepper were listed as wild edible plants, as well as an unidentified yam with the Baka name mboto (
 <italic>Dioscorea</italic> sp.10), which was also collected by us and identified as the domesticated species 
 <italic>Dioscorea dumetorum</italic>.
