<p>Although our research was performed among a relatively small human population, our results show that different methods resulted in substantial differences in the collected data. The 
 <italic>ex-situ</italic> interviews did not capture the full diversity of WEPs known, used and sold by the Baka. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0247108.g003">Fig 3</xref>, the species accumulation curve of the freelisting method flattened after interviewing 55 individuals. Typically, 14 of the 55 respondents did not report any WEP, which resulted in several flat sections in the curve.
