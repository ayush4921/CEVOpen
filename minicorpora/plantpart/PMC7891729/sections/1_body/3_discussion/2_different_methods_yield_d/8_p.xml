<p>On the other hand, 
 <italic>ex-situ</italic> interview methods (including freelisting and dietary recalls) are known to assess the most salient useful plants among a large group of people in a relatively short time, as these techniques are limited by their spatiotemporal context [

 <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Freelisting yields much more information than just plant names and saliency, but also shows the items within a specific (local) domain and consensus in a community [
 <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Conducted among a large number of people and in different seasons, dietary and income recall surveys provide a general overview of plants that contribute substantially to peopleâ€™s daily meals and subsistence strategies. Our results indicate, however, that these short 
 <italic>ex-situ</italic> interviews missed out a substantial part of the WEP diversity known, consumed and traded by the Baka. Our insights show the importance of not relying on either 
 <italic>ex-situ</italic> or 
 <italic>in-situ</italic> methods, but rather combining both approaches to maximize the outputs assessing ethnobotanical practices, which was earlier highlighted by Quinlan [
