<p>Our botanical inventory also revealed that a single folk taxon mentioned during interviews can actually include several species. The local Baka name ‘tondo’ referred to three different species of 
 <italic>Aframomum</italic>, the term ‘bokoko’ to two species of 
 <italic>Klainedoxa</italic>, and ‘payo’ to three different species of 
 <italic>Irvingia</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. On the other hand, for the single taxon 
 <italic>Dioscorea minutiflora</italic>, the Baka distinguished in three distinct types. The huge edible plant diversity collected in the forest survey was facilitated by our previously established list of folk taxa. If this preliminary work would not have been conducted, we would have needed more days of fieldwork and more informants to capture the full diversity of WEP consumed by the Baka.
