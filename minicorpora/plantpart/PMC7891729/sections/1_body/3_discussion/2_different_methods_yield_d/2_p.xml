<p>The species accumulation curve for the dietary recall method flattened after interviewing 83 people (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0247108.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Between respondents 46 and 83, only three new species were mentioned, which suggests that interviewing more respondents would not have led to much more wild edible species being mentioned. Therefore, both freelisting and dietary recalls appeared to have captured most of the WEP diversity that was possible by these methods. In contrast, the species accumulation curve for the walk-in-the-woods method flattened somewhat after 11 days, but not completely (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0247108.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Our Baka informants indeed mentioned that there were additional rare species that could only be found after walking for hours in the forest. We know that at least four other edible species could have been found if we had more time to venture further into the forest. From their Baka names and the literature [
 <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] we assume that these were the African mammee apple (
 <italic>Mammea africana</italic>) with large edible fruits, a species of 
 <italic>Afzelia</italic> of which the red arils around the seeds were eaten, a species of wild 
 <italic>Raphia</italic> palm of which the sap was fermented into palm wine, and the African walnut tree (
 <italic>Coula edulis</italic>) that produced highly valued nuts.
