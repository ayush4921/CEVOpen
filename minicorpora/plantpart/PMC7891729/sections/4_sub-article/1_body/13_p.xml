<p> Answer to comment #2: The International Society for Ethnobiology does not issue permission letters and does not have an ethnical board: it just published standards for researchers, to which we adhered. However, our research was carried out within the ERC project “HARVEST: Plant Foods in Human Evolution; Factors affecting the harvest of nutrients from the floral environment”. For this research project, our co-author Amanda Henry received approval from the Ethical Board of the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Leipzig, Germany. We have added this letter to our submitted files and listed the HARVEST project in the funding. Moreover, before we started our fieldwork, we received permission from the National Committee of Ethics for the Research of Human Health (CNERSH) of the Cameroonian government. We also added this letter to the submitted files.</p>
