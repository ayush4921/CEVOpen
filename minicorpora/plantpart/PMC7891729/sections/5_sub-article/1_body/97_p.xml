<p>The comments raised by the previous reviewers were very pertinent, and authors have satisfactorily addressed all but one comment, i.e. the quality of figures is still poor and needs to be improved. Authors must provide high quality pictures. Other than that, the manuscript is in good shape and acceptable for publication.</p>
