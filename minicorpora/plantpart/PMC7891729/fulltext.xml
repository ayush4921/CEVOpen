In the Congo Basin, these are challenged by the increasing exploitation of forests for bushmeat, commercial hardwood, mining, and large-scale agriculture. In this context, a balanced approach is needed between the pressures from forest exploitation, non-timber forest product trade and the livelihood and dietary behavior of rural communities. While there is a general positive association between tree cover and dietary diversity, the complex biocultural interactions between tropical forest food resources and the communities they sustain are still understudied. This research focuses on the knowledge and use of wild food plants by the forest-dwelling Baka people in southeast Cameroon. By using two different sets of methods, namely <italic>ex-situ</italic> interviews and <italic>in-situ</italic> surveys, we collected ethnographic and ethnobotanical data in two Baka settlements and explored the diversity of wild edible plants known, the frequency of their consumption, and potential conflicts between local diet and commercial trade in forest resources. Within a single Baka population, we showed that the <italic>in-situ</italic> walk-in-the-woods method resulted in more detailed information on wild food plant knowledge and use frequency than the <italic>ex-situ</italic> methods of freelisting and dietary recalls. Our <italic>in-situ</italic> method yielded 91 wild edible species, much more than the <italic>ex-situ</italic> freelisting interviews (38 spp.) and dietary recalls (12 spp.). Our results suggest that studies that are based only on <italic>ex-situ</italic> interviews may underestimate the importance of wild food plants for local communities. We discuss the limitations and strengths of these different methods for investigating the diversity of wild food plant knowledge and uses. Our analysis shows that future studies on wild food plants would profit from a mixed approach that combines <italic>in-situ</italic> and <italic>ex-situ</italic> methods.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>European Research Council</institution></funding-source><award-id>STG&#x02013;677576</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Henry</surname><given-names>Amanda Georganna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100013345</institution-id><institution>Naturalis Biodiversity Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4951-1894</contrib-id><name><surname>van Andel</surname><given-names>Tinde</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>Treub Maatschappij</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4951-1894</contrib-id><name><surname>van Andel</surname><given-names>Tinde</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution>Alberta Mennega Stichting</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heger</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This research has received funding from the European Research Council under the European Union&#x02019;s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program; grant agreement number STG&#x02013;677576 (&#x0201c;HARVEST&#x0201d;) awarded to AGH.

The Congo Basin includes the largest tract of tropical rainforest in Africa. This highly biodiverse region is inhabited by more than 30 million people, including forest-dwelling communities that strongly depend on their natural environment for their survival [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. A wide variety of wild edible plant species (WEP) has been reported for the Congo Basin, among Bantu-speaking farmers and especially among hunter-gatherers that infrequently practice agriculture [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Local people harvest these wild food plants mainly for subsistence use within the household, but a substantial number of species is locally traded, and a few find their way to global markets [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The cash income earned with the trade in non-timber forest products (NTFPs), important for improving livelihoods, can empower local communities [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Wild edible plants also provide a safety net in times of agricultural shortage and are thus essential for food security [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, forest-dwelling societies in the Congo Basin are challenged by a decrease in access to and availability of wild food resources due to the increasing exploitation of the forests for commercial hardwood, precious minerals, and space for oil palm and rubber plantations [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. As a result of large-scale agricultural encroachment, logging, mining and hunting activities, the ecosystems of this region are under severe pressure [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. A recent survey estimated that just 70% of the standing forests of the Congo Basin remain fully intact [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Pressures on local resources have led to a decrease in local people&#x02019;s access to the important wild plants and bushmeat, which contributes substantially to their diet and medicine [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In Cameroon, for example, more than 60% of the top 23 timber species exported from the country also yield important NTFPs for local people. A balanced approach is needed between tropical hardwood exploitation and the livelihoods of rural communities, for which the development and implementation of sustainable forest management plans are essential [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Although the value of local ecological knowledge for informing conservation and environmental management is well established [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and there is a general positive association between tree cover and dietary diversity [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], the complex biocultural interactions between tropical forest food resources and the communities they sustain are still understudied [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. According to Ngome et al. [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], in most poor communities in the Congo Basin, the wide variety of nutrient-rich, wild edible plants are underutilized, either due to ignorance, shame or misconceptions about these foods. Ethnobotanical studies have so far insufficiently provided evidence for the intake, quality and nutritional impacts of WEPs, their contribution to the overall diet and their role in ensuring food security [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Considering the increasing conflicts of interests regarding the use of wild resources, accurate assessments of local uses and dependency on wild plants and animals are necessary to evaluate the effects of commercial forest exploitation on both biodiversity and local livelihoods. The aim of this research was to explore the diversity of wild edible plants known and used by the forest-dwelling Baka people in southeast Cameroon. We also evaluated the frequency of their consumption, potential conflicts between local diet and commercial trade in forest resources, and the different field methods to assess of WEP knowledge and consumption.</p><p>The Baka are Ubangian-speaking forager-horticulturalists, formerly referred to as &#x02018;Pygmies&#x02019; [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Until roughly 50 years ago, they were nomadic foragers who relied on hunting, fishing, gathering, and the exchange of NTFPs for agricultural crops with their neighbors, Bantu-speaking farmers [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Since the 1960s, the Baka have been facing several changes in their livelihood. Due to missionary activities and a government program of sedentarization, they have progressively left their forest camps and settled in villages along logging roads [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Nowadays, Baka livelihood is mostly based on the combination of foraging activities, agricultural work in their own fields and wage labor on Bantu farms or for logging companies [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The settlement programs, which included displacement from protected areas and forced sedentarization, have had drastic effects on Baka livelihood and wellbeing. Increased alcohol abuse, the loss of traditional knowledge, and an increasing destabilization of their natural environment have led to the marginalization of the Baka and their increased dependence on other ethnic groups [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. To evaluate the Baka&#x02019;s reliance on their surrounding forests in the current situation, it is essential to assess not only their knowledge on wild food plants, but also their actual use and commercialization of these species.</p><p>Local knowledge and use of plants are assessed through different ethnobotanical methods, of which the interview is the most widely used. Interview methods vary considerably between studies and are deployed based on the research question addressed [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Freelisting is a frequently used interview method, in which informants are asked to list all items they know within a given domain [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. This technique reveals cultural salience and variations in individuals&#x02019; topical knowledge [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and results in a shortlist of highly valued plants [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. As freelisting enables the collection of data from a large number of informants in a limited amount of time [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], this method is frequently used as a starting point for studying traditional plant knowledge. Local names of plants listed during the freelisting interviews are identified afterwards by collecting voucher specimens for these names. The resulting dataset is then used to draw conclusions about plant knowledge by a certain group of people and/or the potential contribution of wild plants to their diet [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Organizing field trips to collect herbarium specimens of species mentioned during freelisting exercises is often (inaccurately) called the &#x02018;walk-in-the-woods method&#x02019; [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, this technique, first coined by Phillips and Gentry in 1993 [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], implies that participants are encouraged to actively lead field trips and point out all useful plants they know and/or use [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], instead of only helping the researcher search for specimens that can be linked to the local names mentioned during interviews. Data elicited from freelisting appear to be specific to the context in which they were collected (e.g., in the village), creating an unintended but significant bias in this type of ethnobotanical research [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Gathering the data during <italic>ex-situ</italic> interviews, for example in people&#x02019;s home, away from the ecological context in which people collect their plants, may result in lists of only the most salient plant species. Furthermore, the success of freelisting depends on the informants&#x02019; correct understanding of the category or cultural domain (e.g., wild food plants) under discussion [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>In societies that undergo rapid socio-economic changes, people become more integrated into the market economy, change their lifestyle and adopt cultivated or processed substitutes for wild plants in their diet [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. This creates a gap between people&#x02019;s ethnobotanical knowledge and their actual use of plants [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. A discrepancy between the number of useful species known and those actually used indicates that elders who still know how plants were used in the past do not practice this any longer, and infrequently transfer their skills to the next generation [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Freelisting exercises often focus on people&#x02019;s knowledge [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], while recall surveys, developed by social anthropologists for understanding time allocation [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], lead informants to enumerate what they have done during a specific period of time. For instance, dietary recall surveys have been developed to estimate the proportion of different food items in people&#x02019;s diet [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Recently, dietary recalls were introduced in ethnobotanical studies to assess local uses of plants [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], while income recall surveys have been used to assess the contribution of the sale of different forest products to local livelihoods [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Although many studies reported a high diversity of wild edible plant species worldwide [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], research relying on dietary recalls has resulted in surprisingly low numbers of wild species actually being consumed [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Dietary recalls carried out in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) also showed that wild plants did not contribute substantially to rural and urban women diets [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Likewise, the dietary recalls that we recently held among the Baka reported only 15 wild edible species [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], which is much less than the list provided recently in the northern Congo area [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] and in stark contrast to the extensive wild plant knowledge documented almost three decades earlier by anthropologists among the same ethnic group [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].

During our last fieldwork period (2019), we carried out a walk-in-the-woods survey to obtain botanical specimens to match the Baka names of wild food taxa in our preliminary database, but also to verify whether the Baka knew, consumed or traded more plant species than they mentioned previously during the <italic>ex-situ</italic> interview sessions. Therefore, we asked the Baka to suggest several people of different ages and gender who were knowledgeable on wild edible plants and would agree to join us on our collection trips. We worked with one to four informants on each collection day. In total, we worked with 20 individuals (10 women and 10 men), aged between 29 and 80 years, of which nine had participated previously in the <italic>ex-situ</italic> interviews (two in the dietary and the income recalls; two only in the free listing; five in all three methods). During 14 collection days into the area surrounding Le Bosquet and Kungu, we searched for plants that matched our preliminary list of folk taxa, but also asked our informants to point out any other edible species they saw (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0247108.s002">S1 File</xref>). When such a plant was encountered, we collected herbarium material using standard botanical methods [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Fieldtrips lasted from 7:00 am to 15:00 pm, but the distance covered differed per day, as it depended on the number of plants collected. Many more species were collected in the first few days close to the village, while several hours were spent walking to collect rare edible plants on the last days. We paid particular attention to clarify information on Baka folk taxa that consisted of more than one botanical species. For most specimens we collected, we asked our informants for 1) the local name (in Baka, French and/or Nzim&#x000e9;, the Bantu language in this area, if known); 2) plant part(s) used; 3) preparation and application methods; 4) when they had last consumed the plant; 5) whether a part of the plant was sold; 6) in the case of trees, whether the wood was commercially logged. We did not limit our ethnobotanical data to plant uses that were shared among our informants, but were keen to record differences in food plant knowledge, consumption frequency and appreciation of wild edibles among informants.</p><p>Duplicates of voucher specimens were deposited at the National Herbarium of Cameroon (YA) and at the herbarium of Naturalis Biodiversity Center (L). A third voucher was kept at the study site to verify local names and uses with Baka villagers during group discussions.

The carbohydrates provided by wild plants came predominantly from wild yams (<italic>Dioscorea</italic> spp.). The collection of these tubers required expert knowledge, as the Baka first verified whether the plant held tubers that were ready to be consumed, which in the case of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>semperflorens</italic> was done by examining the color of its leaves. The digging of the tubers required certain tools, like a wooden auger to remove the soil and extract the tuber without damaging it, a tool used specifically for both folk taxa of <italic>D</italic>. <italic>praehensilis</italic>. Once dug out, the tubers were washed and boiled. Some wild yams were only consumed occasionally as an emergency food, like &#x02018;boli&#x02019; (<italic>Dioscorea</italic> sp. WTH63), of which the name was translated as &#x02018;adulterer&#x02019;, referring to the shame felt when eating this tuber. Other occasionally consumed wild tubers provided the Baka with carbohydrates, like those of <italic>Palisota</italic> cf. <italic>barteri</italic> and <italic>Dioscoreophyllum cumminsii</italic>.</p><p>To accompany this starchy basis, the Baka prepared a stew in which leafy vegetables and condiments were combined with a fatty basis, mostly obtained from forest seeds. Fruits of <italic>Irvingia</italic> spp., <italic>Baillonella toxisperma</italic> and <italic>Panda oleosa</italic> were gathered from the ground and the kernels were taken out. Most seeds were prepared in a similar way: the kernels were dried and/or roasted, and then pounded and/or ground to a powder that was mixed into the stew. Seeds could also be conserved for some time in the form of a pressed, oily cake. Leaves were either cut into thin slices (e.g., <italic>Gnetum</italic> cf. <italic>africanum</italic>) or pounded in a mortar (e.g., <italic>Hilleria latifolia</italic>) and added to the stew. Condiments were grated (<italic>Afrostyrax lepidophyllus</italic> bark), dried (<italic>Aframomum</italic> spp. seeds), or roasted and crushed (seeds of <italic>Ricinodendron heudelotii</italic> and <italic>Monodora myristica</italic>) before being added to the dish.</p><p>Some wild food plants were eaten only on specific occasions, mostly for ritual purposes. To prepare men before hunting expeditions and increase their success, women prepared the leaves of <italic>Anchomanes difformis</italic>, which were thought to make the hunter fearless for elephants, or the rhizome of <italic>Renealmia</italic> sp. (WTH64), which was thought to bring good luck to the hunter. The leaves of <italic>Costus englerianus</italic> or <italic>Adenia mannii</italic> were prepared to strengthening boys after their circumcision.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Commercialization of wild edible plants</title><p>During the recall exercise on general income received from sale over the 14 previous days, the Baka reported six different taxa as being sold. The most frequently commercialized NTFP was <italic>Gnetum</italic> cf. <italic>africanum</italic> (26% of the 114 interviews), far more than any of the other wild food plants, which were mentioned as sold in less than 5% of the interviews (seeds and oil of <italic>Irvingia gabonensis</italic>, <italic>Baillonella toxisperma</italic>, <italic>Pentaclethra macrophylla</italic>, bark of <italic>Afrostyrax lepidophyllus</italic> and the fruits of <italic>Aframomum</italic> spp., indicated under the general name of &#x02018;tondo&#x02019;). During the walk-in-the-woods surveys, however, the Baka pointed out 24 different WEP species that they sold to middlemen (including the six previously mentioned), mostly in the form of fruits, seeds, or the oil from seeds. Of the 24 commercial species that appeared during the forest surveys, 13 were commonly sold on the international NTFP market (<xref rid="pone.0247108.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).

Most wild food plants occurred in (selectively logged) primary forests, and consisted predominantly of fruits and seeds of canopy trees and lianas, underlying the importance of this ecosystem for Baka diet and culture. For their daily fat intake, the Baka depended heavily on the large fruits and seeds of the Irvingiaceae family, <italic>Panda oleosa</italic> and <italic>Poga oleosa</italic>. These species are typical to the Congo Basin forests, in which complex food and dispersal interactions take place between big terrestrial mammals (such as elephants) and the local flora [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Many of the oily seed-producing trees in Central Africa are ecological keystone species that are crucial for the survival of local wildlife [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], on which forest-dwelling groups such as the Baka rely on for meat [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>The diversity of the wild plants eaten by the Baka covers a wide variety of plants parts, highlighting the role played by WEP in providing important nutrients that may not be found in planted crops and store-bought foods. This diversity is also targeted by traders in timber and non-timber forest products: at least 30 WEP species are either sold to middlemen and enter the (inter-) national NTFP market or are extracted by loggers, which sometimes causes conflicts between the Baka and commercial parties entering their territory. The various direct and indirect effects of logging and trade in NTFPs in this region do not only affect human food resources, but have an impact on the entire ecosystem.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Different methods yield different results</title><p>Although our research was performed among a relatively small human population, our results show that different methods resulted in substantial differences in the collected data. The <italic>ex-situ</italic> interviews did not capture the full diversity of WEPs known, used and sold by the Baka. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0247108.g003">Fig 3</xref>, the species accumulation curve of the freelisting method flattened after interviewing 55 individuals. Typically, 14 of the 55 respondents did not report any WEP, which resulted in several flat sections in the curve.</p><fig id="pone.0247108.g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0247108.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>Species accumulation curves of WEPs mentioned during the 55 freelisting and 83 dietary recall interviews in Le Bosquet and Kungu, southeast Cameroon, 2018.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0247108.g003"/></fig><p>The species accumulation curve for the dietary recall method flattened after interviewing 83 people (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0247108.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Between respondents 46 and 83, only three new species were mentioned, which suggests that interviewing more respondents would not have led to much more wild edible species being mentioned. Therefore, both freelisting and dietary recalls appeared to have captured most of the WEP diversity that was possible by these methods. In contrast, the species accumulation curve for the walk-in-the-woods method flattened somewhat after 11 days, but not completely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0247108.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Our Baka informants indeed mentioned that there were additional rare species that could only be found after walking for hours in the forest. We know that at least four other edible species could have been found if we had more time to venture further into the forest. From their Baka names and the literature [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] we assume that these were the African mammee apple (<italic>Mammea africana</italic>) with large edible fruits, a species of <italic>Afzelia</italic> of which the red arils around the seeds were eaten, a species of wild <italic>Raphia</italic> palm of which the sap was fermented into palm wine, and the African walnut tree (<italic>Coula edulis</italic>) that produced highly valued nuts.</p><fig id="pone.0247108.g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0247108.g004</object-id><label>Fig 4</label><caption><title>Species accumulation curve of wild edible plants mentioned during 14 days of walking in the forest with 20 informants around Le Bosquet and Kungu, southeast Cameroon, 2019.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0247108.g004"/></fig><p>Regarding the overall WEP diversity recorded through the different methods, we see that the botanical diversity reported would have been considerably less if we would only have conducted the <italic>ex-situ</italic> interviews. The freelisting (38 WEP species) and dietary recalls (12 spp.) resulted in just a fraction of the 91 species found during the walk-in-the-woods survey. Such low number of species reported may be partly due to the fact that not every participant understood the concept of &#x02018;wild edible plant&#x02019;. Wild food plants play an important role in Baka livelihood [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and knowledge related to edible plants is acquired early during childhood [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Therefore, it seems unlikely that those Baka adult informants who did not report any WEP during the freelisting did not know any. They probably did not understand the domain, or the domain was too ubiquitous, a limitation that has been also found in other settings [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>].</p><p>During the walk-in-the-woods method, the researcher can directly exclude items pointed out by informants that fall outside the domain &#x02018;wild edible plant&#x02019;, such as fungi, animal products and cultivated plants, although the latter category can be challenging due to the presence of wild species under various degrees and types of human management and domestication [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Local names listed as &#x02018;wild edible plant&#x02019; during <italic>ex-situ</italic> interviews may later, during botanical collection trips, appear to refer to domesticated crops, like the cultivated American crop species tania (<italic>Xanthosoma sagittifolium</italic>) and chili pepper (<italic>Capsicum frutescens</italic>), which were listed as wild edibles during freelisting interviews in the DRC [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This was also the case in a recent study on WEP consumed by Baka south of the Dja Reserve [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>], in which the domesticated crops okra (<italic>Abelmoschus esculentus</italic>), sorrel (<italic>Hibiscus sabdariffa</italic>) and chili pepper were listed as wild edible plants, as well as an unidentified yam with the Baka name mboto (<italic>Dioscorea</italic> sp.10), which was also collected by us and identified as the domesticated species <italic>Dioscorea dumetorum</italic>.</p><p>Our botanical inventory also revealed that a single folk taxon mentioned during interviews can actually include several species. The local Baka name &#x02018;tondo&#x02019; referred to three different species of <italic>Aframomum</italic>, the term &#x02018;bokoko&#x02019; to two species of <italic>Klainedoxa</italic>, and &#x02018;payo&#x02019; to three different species of <italic>Irvingia</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. On the other hand, for the single taxon <italic>Dioscorea minutiflora</italic>, the Baka distinguished in three distinct types. The huge edible plant diversity collected in the forest survey was facilitated by our previously established list of folk taxa. If this preliminary work would not have been conducted, we would have needed more days of fieldwork and more informants to capture the full diversity of WEP consumed by the Baka.</p><p>While only six commercial wild food plants were recorded through the income recall surveys, the walk-in-the-woods method revealed 24 traded species, of which several had never been reported previously as sold in Cameroon. Moreover, this <italic>in-situ</italic> method allowed us to observe traces of logged WEP species and unsustainable ways of harvesting NTFPs. Only ten of the 26 species mentioned as recently consumed during the walk-in-the-woods method were reported during the freelisting, while just three of them also emerged through the dietary recalls, although the number of people interviewed during the last two methods was substantially higher. In other words, 23 recently consumed species would not have been identified with dietary recalls only, and 16 would have been missed if only the freelisting and dietary recalls would have been performed. We speculate that these were plants that were easily forgotten (e.g., spices, condiments, small fruits), species that people feel ashamed of eating (weeds), or items that were previously missed during the freelistings due to misinterpretation of the term &#x02018;wild edible plant&#x02019; (e.g., drinking water from lianas, edible latex, ritual food plants). If we had only used the <italic>ex-situ</italic> interview data, we would have missed four wild fruit trees that were extracted by timber companies. Only two of these WEP-producing commercial hardwoods were mentioned in the freelisting interviews (<italic>Baillonella toxisperma</italic> and <italic>Chrysophyllum lacourtianum</italic>), while only one was recorded through the dietary recalls (<italic>B</italic>. <italic>toxisperma</italic>).</p><p>The advantage of assessing plant knowledge within the ecological context is that many species are encountered that do not pop-up quickly in people&#x02019;s minds during a (shorter) interview outside the forest. When walking through the natural environment where edible plants occur, it is easier to remember them because of the amounts of visual stimuli to this knowledge at that moment [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. The walk-in-the-woods method, however, is laborious to perform and requires additional botanical collection, as more rare species will be encountered that are hard to identify, for which the help of taxonomic specialists and support from herbaria is needed. The number of informants that can be taken into the field is also limited and thus forest surveys are not suitable to draw conclusions on the general patterns of foraging, plant knowledge and uses.</p><p>On the other hand, <italic>ex-situ</italic> interview methods (including freelisting and dietary recalls) are known to assess the most salient useful plants among a large group of people in a relatively short time, as these techniques are limited by their spatiotemporal context [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Freelisting yields much more information than just plant names and saliency, but also shows the items within a specific (local) domain and consensus in a community [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Conducted among a large number of people and in different seasons, dietary and income recall surveys provide a general overview of plants that contribute substantially to people&#x02019;s daily meals and subsistence strategies. Our results indicate, however, that these short <italic>ex-situ</italic> interviews missed out a substantial part of the WEP diversity known, consumed and traded by the Baka. Our insights show the importance of not relying on either <italic>ex-situ</italic> or <italic>in-situ</italic> methods, but rather combining both approaches to maximize the outputs assessing ethnobotanical practices, which was earlier highlighted by Quinlan [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>].</p><p>Since they can lead to an underestimation of wild edible plants known, consumed and commercially exploited, the implications of studies based solely on <italic>ex-situ</italic> interviews can be grave. Results of such studies may not be representative for the situation on the ground, as trade in NTFPs or conflicts between wild fruit collection and logging of fruit-producing trees may remain invisible. An assessment of Baka knowledge on wild edible plants relying on <italic>ex-situ</italic> methods only might have led to the conclusion that the Baka have lost much of their knowledge, or do not use the forest so intensively as their ancestors did. Moreover, the calculations of the contribution of wild plants to local diet and nutrition would have been inaccurate. Several studies based on dietary recalls have concluded that WEP do not play an important role in local diets. Termote et al. [51:8] said they were &#x0201c;confident to provide a fair representation of the dietary contribution of WEP on a population level in our sample&#x0201d;, even though their botanical collection was limited to finding specimens to match the local names mentioned during their dietary recalls and freelisting interviews. In Brazil, scholars stated after their freelisting and dietary recall surveys that &#x0201c;the low consumption of wild species [&#x02026;.] is notable, which suggests that, in practice, these foods contribute little to contemporary dietary enrichment&#x0201d; [50:337]. Such data could be misused by policy makers, who may conclude that rural communities do not need the forest that much as previously thought. Considering the importance of wild plants for food security and for providing nutrients that are not present in other foods [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>], and the fact that children are major consumers of wild fruits but hardly recruited as interviewees [<xref rid="pone.0247108.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0247108.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>], it is crucial to draw the most accurate overview of the diversity of wild food items used by local people, especially in species-rich ecosystems in which plants, animals and human livelihoods are under increasing pressure.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec014"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our results show that choosing an appropriate method (or combination of methods) is essential for assessing wild food plant knowledge and consumption. Ethnobotanical inventories that leave room for informants to point out edible plants that do not appear on predefined lists are essential to capture the full diversity of edible forest species. Our <italic>in-situ</italic> inventories yielded a wide variety of WEP that were not covered by our <italic>ex-situ</italic> interview methods, revealed details on local patterns of foraging and challenged the general ideas of knowledge loss and underutilization of wild food plants in the region. Our mixed methods approach shows the importance of cross-referencing data, not only between different types of interviews, but also between interviews and direct observation during forest trips, for a better assessment of the diversity, consumption frequency, trade and conflicting uses of WEP. We therefore recommend that wild plant knowledge and use should be assessed through the use of a mixed methods approach. Using &#x02018;open&#x02019; walk-in-the-woods surveys, in which informants are encouraged to mention any useful plant they know or randomly encounter, after which they are asked when they last used it, provides a wider variety of data. Employing the walk-in-the-woods technique merely to supply specimens for previously composed lists of useful plants from literature or interviews limits the capacity of this powerful technique to assess wild plant knowledge and use. Freelisting and dietary recalls can be used to provide quantitative data and a more general overview, but researchers should not limit themselves to such methods if they want to capture the full diversity of plants known and used, especially in the case when biased conclusions may have large implications for people&#x02019;s future livelihood, culture and wellbeing.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec015"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0247108.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Wild edible plants reported during the walk-in-the-woods, free listing and dietary recalls in Le Bosquet and Kungu, southeast Cameroon.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0247108.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0247108.s002"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Data collection protocol for <italic>ex-situ</italic> interviews and <italic>in-situ</italic> interviews.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0247108.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank our assistants Appolinaire Ambassa, Ernest Isidore Simpoh and driver Alain Hyppolite Fezeu for their help with the fieldwork.

In the abstract section, the line number 37 should be rephrased as; We discussed the limitation and strength of these different methods for investigating the diversity of wild food plant; their available knowledge and usage.</p><p>2. Grammatical errors should be improved e.g. use of helping verbs, placements of punctuation signs.</p><p>a. Line number 110: Plant knowledge of a certain group of people; should be corrected as; plant knowledge by a certain group of people.</p><p>b. Line number 112: The specimen of species mentioned during free listing should be corrected as; specimen of species identified during free listing.</p><p>c. Line number 115: All useful plants they know and/or use should be corrected as; all useful plants they know or their usage.</p><p>3. The line number 38 should be made understandable as; Hence, this analysis will help to further investigate more information regarding wild food plant and their usage frequency, through mixed approach the combines in-situ and ex-situ methods.</p><p>4. The line number 70; According to Ngome et al.; as reference number is already given, so rearrange the sentence like; According to another study reported,&#x02026; .</p><p>5. From line number 100 to 123; the list of different ethnobotanical method used in this investigation should be included in the methodology section.</p><p>6. Line number 156: the sentence should be like; how do different methods for assessing WEP used in this study vary in their results?</p><p>7. It is suggested to have a scheme of study i.e. comprehensive framework under which the study is designed and executed e.g. a flow chart or a step by step methodology (figure) followed in this investigation.</p><p>8. Line number 180: our inventory of wild food plant knowledge, use and commercialization should be corrected as; our inventory of wild food plant knowledge, their usage and its commercialization.</p><p>9. All the tables in the manuscript should be justified as, &#x0201c;Centered- alignment&#x0201d; for all cells of the table; or keep the same alignment for all the tables.</p><p>10. Table 1; number of participants should be corrected as; (number of participants= n).</p><p>11. Line number 274; kindly mention the figure number.</p><p>12. Line number 354; it is recommended to rephrase the heading as; WEP parts used and their preparation method.</p><p>13. Line number 336; as this line is a part of table number 2, so try to align it on the same page with the table.</p><p>14. Table number 3; please elaborate what denotes &#x0201c;y&#x0201d; here.</p><p>15. Line number 525- 541; if this information can be presented in tabular or graphical form/as there is no reference given for any table or figure, that where they are presented.</p><p>16. Line number 572; on a population level in our sample should be like; on a population level in our sample collection.</p><p>17. Line number 575; kindly correct the formatting mistake.</p><p>18. It is suggested that &#x0201c;The accuracy of different methods used in this investigation can be presented either in a graphical or tabular form to highlight their efficiency&#x0201d;.</p><p>Reviewer #6:&#x000a0;It is suggested to list plant species which are used as folk medicine in a separate list and those which are consumed as dietary by people. Are any plants that have not been reported by plant taxonomists?</p><p>Reviewer #7:&#x000a0;In this study, Gallois et al present a case study suggesting the importance of appropriate methods for assessing wild food plant knowledge and consumption.</p><p>The comments raised by the previous reviewers were very pertinent, and authors have satisfactorily addressed all but one comment, i.e. the quality of figures is still poor and needs to be improved. Authors must provide high quality pictures. Other than that, the manuscript is in good shape and acceptable for publication.</p><p>**********</p><p>7.
