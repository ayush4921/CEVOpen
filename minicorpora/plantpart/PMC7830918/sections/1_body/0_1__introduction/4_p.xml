 <xref rid="B4-ijerph-18-00741" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Starch is the principal carbohydrate in green mango; during maturation, it converts to reducing sugars (sucrose, glucose, and fructose). Along with these carbohydrates, small quantities of cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin are present in ripe mango [

Unripe mango tastes sour because of the presence of different acids, such as citric acid, malic acid, oxalic acid, succinic, and other organic acids, whereas the sweet taste of the ripened fruit is due to the blending of reducing sugar and the main acid source, malic acid [
