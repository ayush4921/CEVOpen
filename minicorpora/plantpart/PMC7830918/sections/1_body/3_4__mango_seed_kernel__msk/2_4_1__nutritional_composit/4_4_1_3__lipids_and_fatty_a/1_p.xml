<p>Lipids are highly nutritious, have high energy values, and are well-known for their functional properties. Mango seed kernel, containing 8.15% to 13.16% of oil, is an appealing lipid source because of its nutritive and health beneficial properties [
 <xref rid="B96-ijerph-18-00741" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. The physical and chemical properties of the lipids and fatty acids present in the MSK are listed in 
 <xref rid="ijerph-18-00741-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The MSK fat characteristics are comparable with those of vegetable butter [
 <xref rid="B86-ijerph-18-00741" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>], with a predominant presence of stearic and oleic acids. In some varieties, the unsaturated fatty acid content, especially linoleic acid, is twice and even three times higher than that of saturated fatty acids [
 <xref rid="B94-ijerph-18-00741" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. The high stearic and oleic acid contents in the total fatty acid profile of the MSK is attributed to its higher stability than polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs)-containing oils. Hence, the MSK oil is suitable and safe for daily cooking [

 <xref rid="B97-ijerph-18-00741" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. The good quality of edible oil in MSK is comparable to soybean and cotton seed oil. The total phenolic content and induction period of MSK oil is greater than several commercial vegetable oils [
 <xref rid="B98-ijerph-18-00741" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. The yield of MSK oil can be increased by increasing temperature, time and volume of extraction solvent [
 <xref rid="B84-ijerph-18-00741" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. However, the safety and suitability of MSK oil is depends on the extraction procedure and quality of the MSK.
