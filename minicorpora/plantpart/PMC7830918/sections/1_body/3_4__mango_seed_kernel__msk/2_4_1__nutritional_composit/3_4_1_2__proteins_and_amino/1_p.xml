<p>The MSK contains 6â€“13% protein by DW and content, mainly depending on variety. Though the protein content is low in the seed, it is nutritious protein because of its essential amino acid composition, including leucine (6.9 g), isoleucine (4.4 g), methionine (1.2 g), phenylalanine (3.4 g), lysine (4.3 g), threonine (3.4 g), tyrosine (2.7 g), and valine (5.8 g) per 100 g protein [

These essential amino acids, except methionine, occur in higher levels in the MSK than the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)-referenced protein: the essential amino acids content in MSK is 70% higher compared to the standard proteins [

Nevertheless, the protein present in MSK is high quality due to its high essential amino acid content and protein quality index [
