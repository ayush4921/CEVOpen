<p>The lipid and fatty acid proportion in mango pulp is lower than the protein content and much lower than the carbohydrates. The fatty acid composition of pulp was studied in many mango varieties, and triglycerols were found to be the major constituent along with minor levels of mono- and diglycerols. The total content ranges from 0.8% to 1.36% [
