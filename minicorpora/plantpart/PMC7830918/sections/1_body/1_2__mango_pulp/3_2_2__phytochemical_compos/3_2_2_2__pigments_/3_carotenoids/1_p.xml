<p>Mango is one of the best sources of carotenoids; carotenoids are mostly responsible for the peel and flesh colors: yellow, orange, or red. Carotenoids, which exist in chromoplasts, are usually covered by chlorophyll and non-photosynthetic plant tissues [

Carotenoids present in the mango belong to two main groups: hydrocarbon carotenoids or carotenes (α-, β-, and γ-carotene) and xanthophylls or oxygenated derivatives (auraxanthin, antheraxanthin, neoxanthin, lutein, violaxanthin, cryptoxanthin and zeaxanthin). There are 25 different carotenoids that have been identified in the pulp and peel of mango. Among them, all-
