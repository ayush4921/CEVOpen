<p>Carotenoids are fat-soluble pigments that create the different fruit colors, such as yellow, orange, and red. Similar to pulp, mango peel contains high concentrations of carotenoids in the form of β-carotene, which provides vitamin A [

 <xref rid="B74-ijerph-18-00741" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Ranganath et al. [
 <xref rid="B75-ijerph-18-00741" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] analyzed the carotenoid compositions of different-colored mango peel at different phases of ripening, and identified eight carotenoids in 12 selected cultivars of various colors. They further identified content variation with respect to the color of the fruit. In all cultivars, β-carotene, cis-β-carotene, and violaxanthin isomers presented as the principal compounds. The highest content (31.18 µg/g FW) was observed in yellow-colored Arka Anmol, and the lowest content (0.74 µg/g) in Janardhan Pasand. The highest β-carotene concentration (13.01 µg/g FW) was reported in yellow-colored Arka Anmol, along with its presence in all the tested mango cultivars. The concentration of carotenoids usually increases during ripening and is high in the yellow-colored stage.
