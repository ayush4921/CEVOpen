In addition, for removing the actual drawbacks of drug-transporting vectors (such as phospholipids degradation, quick systemic exclusion, inadequate stability under prolonged storage, moderate efficiency for entrapping lipophilic compounds) [
 <xref rid="B146-ijms-22-01521" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>], further in-depth studies are required. In addition to medical applications, phytosynthesized metallic nanoparticles could be applied as biosensors for the food industry or environment protection, offering on-site monitoring and providing real-time data, replacing the expensive equipment and sample processing, and providing the foundation for the development of next-generation catalysts or other important industrial applications.
