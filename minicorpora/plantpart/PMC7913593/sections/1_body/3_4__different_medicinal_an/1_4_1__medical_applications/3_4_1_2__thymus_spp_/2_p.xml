<p>In order to eradicate pathogenic yeasts strains, such as 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, 
 <italic>C. krusei</italic>, or 
 <italic>C. glabrata</italic>, Muslim and Hussin proposed a recipe based on the synergistic effects of 
 <italic>Thymus kotschanus</italic> Boiss &amp; Hohen essential oil and ketoconazole for decreasing the incidence of candidiasis among vulnerable individuals with underlying diseases (antibiotic therapy, AIDS, etc.) [
 <xref rid="B95-ijms-22-01521" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. In this case, the role of the essential oil was to inhibit the microbial population and to increase the permeability of fungal membranes, making them more sensitive to other antifungal agents, such as synthetic drugs. As a perspective of using EO for downexpressing the Als (Agglutinin-like sequence), a biofilm-associated gene is the development of future in vivo studies to optimize the effects of temperature, pH, host responses, as well as drug resistance to these EOs.
