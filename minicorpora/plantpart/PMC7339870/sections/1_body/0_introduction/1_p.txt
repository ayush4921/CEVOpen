0: Metabolic diseases have a complex etiology dominated by genetic predisposition and environmental factors like diet or lifestyle ( Barroso and McCarthy, 2019).
1: The most important metabolic diseases with a significant impact on global health are diabetes mellitus (type 1 or insulin-dependent and type 2 or non-insulin-dependent) and dyslipidemias (hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and mixed dyslipidemia).
2: Diabetes mellitus affected at least 422 million people worldwide in 2014, and caused 1.5 million deaths in 2012, according to an official report of the World Health Organization (WHO) from 2016, which also stated that the global prevalence of the disease has nearly doubled from 1980, reaching an alarming level of 8.5% in the adult population ( World Health Organization, 2016).
3: Dyslipidemia is a major risk factor for ischemic heart disease and stroke, causing 2.6 million deaths and 29.7 million disability adjusted life years (DALYS) in 2008 ( World Health Organization, 2008).
4: In diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic hyperglycemia may result from an impaired insulin secretion and/or resistance of key peripheral tissues to the effects of insulin ( Tan et al., 2019).
5: In dyslipidemia, elevated concentrations of total cholesterol and low-density lipoproteins (LDL) can induce endothelial cell dysfunction and smooth muscle cell proliferation leading to the genesis of atherosclerotic plaque ( Helkin et al., 2016).
6: Over time, chronic hyperglycemia or hypercholesterolemia associated with the two diseases which can also coexist, can cause significant vascular complications, leading to dysfunction or failure of multiple organs (brain, heart, kidneys), with possible fatal consequences or a severe reduction of life quality ( De Fronzo et al., 2015).
