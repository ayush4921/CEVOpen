0: Essential oils are complex mixtures of aromatic terpenes (mainly monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes) formed as secondary metabolites in specialized secretory tissues of aromatic plants ( Sharifi-Rad et al., 2017).
1: Nowadays, essential oils as main constituents of aromatic plants, are widely used for their flavoring properties in food industry or as fragrances in cosmetology, but there is also a growing interest for the evaluation of their complex pharmacological effects.
2: Multiple studies proved antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, or antinociceptive effects of essential oils ( Bakkali et al., 2008), but there are limited data concerning possible effects on glucose and lipid metabolism.
3: Therefore, the aim of this review was to evaluate the antidiabetic and antihyperlipidemic effect of essential oils, presenting the experimental pharmacological models used for their study, with the subsequent mechanistic explanations.
