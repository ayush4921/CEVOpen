<p>Essential oils are complex mixtures of aromatic terpenes (mainly monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes) formed as secondary metabolites in specialized secretory tissues of aromatic plants (
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Sharifi-Rad et al., 2017</xref>). Nowadays, essential oils as main constituents of aromatic plants, are widely used for their flavoring properties in food industry or as fragrances in cosmetology, but there is also a growing interest for the evaluation of their complex pharmacological effects. Multiple studies proved antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, or antinociceptive effects of essential oils (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Bakkali et al., 2008</xref>), but there are limited data concerning possible effects on glucose and lipid metabolism. Therefore, the aim of this review was to evaluate the antidiabetic and antihyperlipidemic effect of essential oils, presenting the experimental pharmacological models used for their study, with the subsequent mechanistic explanations.
