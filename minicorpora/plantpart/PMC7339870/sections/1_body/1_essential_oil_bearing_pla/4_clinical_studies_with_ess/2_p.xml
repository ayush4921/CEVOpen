<p>The analysis of data resulted from the selected clinical studies showed that cumin (

 <italic>)</italic> essential oil was predominantly used for the treatment of diabetes and dyslipidemia, only one study using another essential oil, extracted from the black cumin (
 <italic>Nigella sativa</italic> L.). According to the majority of these studies, the administered essential oils managed to reduce fasting blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin in diabetic patients, decreasing also total cholesterol and LDL concentration in dyslipidemia. Nevertheless, the presented clinical studies with antidiabetic and antihyperlipidemic essential oils have several limitations. They were represented mainly by randomized control studies (RCTs) using small numbers of patients with an insufficient statistical significance. Only one study was a meta-analysis with superior statistical power, although itself used a limited number of randomized controlled trials (
