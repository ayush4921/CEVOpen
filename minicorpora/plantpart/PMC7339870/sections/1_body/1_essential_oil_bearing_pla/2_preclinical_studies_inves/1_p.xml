<p>This review showed that essential oils from fifteen aromatic plant species belonging to eight families presented antidiabetic properties demonstrated by specific 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> or 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> preclinical experimental models. The aromatic plant families with the highest proportion of species with antidiabetic essential oils (EO) were Lamiaceae (six species), Apiaceae (two species) and Rutaceae (two species). Other identified families were Asteraceae, Fabaceae, Lauraceae, Myrtaceae, and Ranunculaceae, each with only one plant species with antidiabetic essential oils (
