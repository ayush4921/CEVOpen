<p>Balkan peninsula is a vast territory extending from Central Europe in the north to the Eastern Mediterranean region in the south and from Black Sea in the east to the Adriatic Sea in the west. It includes the modern states of Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Romania (Dobrogea region), Serbia, Slovenia, and Turkey (European region). The complexity of Balkan geography favored a significant biodiversity in the plant kingdom (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Griffiths et al., 2004</xref>), with a number of around 8,000 plant species and subspecies being catalogued, of which 2,600 to 2,700 are considered endemic (

 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Dzamic and Matejic, 2017</xref>). An ethnobotanical study from Bosnia-Herzegovina identified 228 plant species used in traditional medicine for the treatment of respiratory, gastrointestinal but also metabolic disorders, among which aromatic plants like 
 <italic>Foeniculum vulgare</italic> Mill., or 
 <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> L. are used in herbal infusions in rural areas from the central part of the country (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Saric-Kundalic et al., 2010</xref>). In Greece, a field study found 109 plant species known for medicinal purposes, some of them being used for essential oil extraction, sometimes by traditional methods from aromatic plants cultivated in small areas like 
 <italic>Lavandula stoechas</italic> L., used for skin infections and burns (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Axiotis et al., 2018</xref>). Another study mentioned an endemic essential oil-bearing plant species, 
 <italic>Pistacia lentiscus</italic> L. var. 
 <italic>chia</italic>, uniquely present on Chios Island in the Eastern Aegean region of Greece, used in traditional medicine over the last 2,500 years in the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders which recently proved significant antihyperlipidemic and cardioprotective effects (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Pachi et al., 2020</xref>). A study from Serbia identified 83 plant species including two aromatic plants present in the wild flora of the Kopaonik Mountain region (
 <italic>Melissa officinalis</italic> L. and 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> L.) which were used in the treatment of gastrointestinal, respiratory, or cardiac disorders but also in metabolic diseases (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Jaric et al., 2007</xref>). In Turkey, a survey study found that of 64 plant species used in traditional medicine, 9 species were used for essential oil production which are usually sold in local markets as remedies for urinary, respiratory or cardiovascular diseases but also for diabetes like the essential oil from 
 <italic>Myrtus communis</italic> L., endemic in the Mediterranean area (
