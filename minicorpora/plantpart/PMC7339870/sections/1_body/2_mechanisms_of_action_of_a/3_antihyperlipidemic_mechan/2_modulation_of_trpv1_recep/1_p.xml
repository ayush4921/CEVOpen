<p>The transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) was considered to have important roles on sensory neurons, however other research demonstrated its presence on hepatocytes with possible roles in reducing blood cholesterol level. A recently published study investigated the effects of 
 <bold>eugenol</bold>, an active compound present in several essential oils, including lemon balm EO, on lipid profile in rats fed with cholesterol-enriched diet. The obtained data showed that 
 <bold>eugenol</bold> administered orally to the rats, in doses of 10 to 100 mg/kg, reduced total cholesterol, LDL, and atherogenic index in treated animals. Immunohistochemical methods proved that menthol down-regulated TRPV1 receptor in the liver of treated animals, mechanism supported by collateral molecular docking studies. Additionally, a histopathological examination performed in the same study found that eugenol protected the liver, reducing hepatic steatosis and the level of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity (
