<p>Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is capable of hydrolyzing triacylglycerols from VLDL fraction, with the apparition of monoacylglycerol used by specific tissues. The activation of the enzyme is produced by fibrates, a well-established class of drugs used in the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia. An 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> study using Triton WR1339-induced dyslipidemia model in rats, proved that essential oil from the plant 
 <italic>Pistacia lentiscus</italic> L. var. 
 <italic>chia</italic>, endemic in the island of Chios in Greece, was capable of activating lipoprotein lipase in rats with a subsequent 34.5% reduction of triglycerides (

 <bold>camphene</bold> was the active substance responsible for this effect, no significant changes in plasma lipids of treated animals being observed for other terpenoids present in the essential oil, which were individually tested. Additionally, camphene reduced also total cholesterol and LDL, suggesting that this monoterpene could be a possible drug candidate in the development of new antihyperlipidemic molecules. Another 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> study using high fed diet (HFD) mice found that administration of 
 <bold>thymol</bold> (10â€“40 mg/kg for 5 weeks), an important active compound from thyme essential oil, caused a reduction of triglycerides and total cholesterol in treated animals, producing also an increase in HDL concentration. The study suggested that the augmentation of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity and a reduction in leptin concentration could be main mechanisms responsible for the antihyperlipidemic effect (
