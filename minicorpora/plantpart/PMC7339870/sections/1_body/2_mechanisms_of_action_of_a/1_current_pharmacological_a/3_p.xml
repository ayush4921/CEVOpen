<p>Unfortunately, the beneficial effects of many existing antidiabetic or antihyperlipidemic drugs are accompanied by numerous adverse effects, sometimes severe, which can limit patientâ€™s compliance and treatment efficacy. Hence, there is a growing need for new drug candidates with improved characteristics, among which naturally occurring molecules like essential oils could play an important part. Essential oils have a complex chemical composition which allows them to target multiple physiological structures and processes involved in glucose metabolism, several mechanisms of action being described. Although some aspects of the antidiabetic effect of essential oils and their constituents have been explained, further research is needed for a better understanding of their cellular and molecular actions.</p>
