<p>The main objective of antidiabetic medication is the reduction of hyperglycemia and the risk of vascular complications, which can be achieved by multiple pharmacological mechanisms, due to the complexity of glucose metabolism (

Various types of insulins, with different pharmacokinetic properties are administered subcutaneously in type 1 diabetes, acting as agonists on specific receptors expressed by a variety of cells including hepatocytes, adipocytes, or muscular cells. Subsequently, key glucose transporters (GLUT) are activated at cellular level, inducing a significant reduction of blood glucose. For type 2 diabetes, multiple classes of antidiabetic drugs are currently on the market. Sulfonylureas and meglitinides act as insulin secretagogues, amplifying the exocytosis of insulin granules from pancreatic beta-cells. Other classes like biguanides increase the uptake and metabolism of glucose in peripheral tissues while inhibitors of alpha-glucosidase limit the amount of absorbed glucose in the digestive tract. Another approach was to target peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors gamma (PPAR-Î³) with thiazolidinedione drugs, in order to obtain an increased expression of glucose transporters in key peripheral cells. The more recently developed incretin mimetic drugs can either act as agonists on incretin receptors or inhibit incretin metabolism by blocking dipeptidyl-peptidase IV enzyme, both with complex beneficial effects on glucose metabolism. Finally, the inhibitors of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) act by augmenting the urinary excretion of glucose (
