<p>In dyslipidemia, the main objective of the medication is to minimize the risk of major vascular events like stroke or heart attack by reducing the level of LDL, the most atherogenic lipoprotein fraction. The backbone of antihyperlipidemic drugs is represented by statins which inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, reducing the formation of mevalonate, a precursor of cholesterol. Additionally, statins may increase the number of LDL receptors on hepatocytes which also contributes to their cholesterol lowering effect (

Fibrates are used especially in hypertriglyceridemia and mixed dyslipidemia, acting as agonists on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha) which leads to the activation of lipoprotein lipase with the subsequent degradation of VLDL fraction rich in triglycerides. Bile acid sequestrants like cholestyramine act by removing bile acids from enterohepatic circuit with the slow development of a cholesterol lowering effect. Ezetimibe, a more recent drug, can reduce intestinal absorption of cholesterol by blocking its main transporter, the Nieman-Pick C1-Like1 (NPC1L1) protein, being frequently used in association with statins (

A novel class is represented by monoclonal antibodies against proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), a protein involved in lysosomal degradation of LDL receptors in the hepatocytes. They are reserved for selected cases of familial heterozygous or homozygous hypercholesterolemia in patients insufficiently controlled with the maximal tolerable doses of statins (
