<p>Insulin intracellular signaling is a complex process finalized with the translocation of GLUT2 and GLUT4 glucose transporters from the cytoplasm of target cells to their membrane. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) contribute to this process. An 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> study using genetically modified diabetic mice (db/db) demonstrated that oral administration of essential oil from 
 <italic>Melissa officinalis</italic> L. in a dose of 0.015 mg/day for 6 weeks, significantly reduced blood glucose and improved glucose tolerance. The RT-PCR and Western blotting methods performed in this study proved that the essential oil was able to increase the expression of glucose transporter (GLUT4) genes probably by the activation of PI3K cascade, leading to an increased glucose uptake in key cells of treated animals (

 <italic>in vitro</italic> study on cultivated astrocytes originating from C57BL/6 mice pups, proved that 
 <bold>eugenol</bold>, a main constituent in several essential oils, was capable of enhancing intracellular insulin signaling mechanism by increasing AKT phosphorylation, without changing PTP-1B expression (
