<p>SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV spike protein have 76.5% identical amino acid sequences [
 <xref rid="B10-medicina-57-00169" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The 3D structures of spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV as analyzed by computer imaging revealed that both have identical structures in the receptor-binding domain and maintains the Vander Waals force [
 <xref rid="B10-medicina-57-00169" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The major amino acid residue of SARS-CoV-2 in the receptor-binding domain is Gln-493, which favors the attachment of spike protein S with human cells more specifically with the lungs therefore the attachment results in respiratory infections in humans [

 <xref rid="B12-medicina-57-00169" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Zhao et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-medicina-57-00169" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] have suggested that 83% of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE-2) expressing cells are alveolar epithelial type II, therefore, these cells can be the reservoir for the viral invasion. Some analysts have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE-2 more efficiently as compared with SARS-CoV, therefore, it has a greater ability to transmit from person to person [
