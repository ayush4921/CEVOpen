0: SARS-CoV-2 genome is 80% similar to the previous human coronavirus SARS-CoV [ 8].
1: For some of the encoded proteins such as coronavirus main proteinase (3CLpro), papain-like protease (PLpro), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) the sequence similarity is very high (96%) between SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 [ 9].
