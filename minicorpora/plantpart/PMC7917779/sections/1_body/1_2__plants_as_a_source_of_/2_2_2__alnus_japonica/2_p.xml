<p>Diarylheptanoids isolated from 
 <italic>Alnus japonica</italic> showed inhibitory activity against papain-like protease (required for replication of SARS-CoV) [
 <xref rid="B40-medicina-57-00169" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Nine diarylheptanoids were isolated, namely, platyphyllenone, hirsutenone, hirsutanonol, oregonin, rubranol, rubranoside B, and rubranoside A. Furthermore, hirsutenone, hirsutanonol, oregonin, rubranol, rubranoside B, and rubranoside A showed dose-dependent inhibitory activity against the papain-like protease. They also showed that hirsutenone possessed the most potent inhibitory activity against papain-like protease. Furthermore, the analysis of Park et al. [
 <xref rid="B40-medicina-57-00169" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] showed that catechol and α,β-unsaturated carbonyl moiety were present in the molecule, which are the key requirements for SARS-CoV cysteine protease inhibition.
