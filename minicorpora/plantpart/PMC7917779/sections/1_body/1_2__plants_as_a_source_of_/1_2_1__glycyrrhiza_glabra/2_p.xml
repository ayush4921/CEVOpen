 <xref rid="B31-medicina-57-00169" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Cinatal et al. [
 <xref rid="B36-medicina-57-00169" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] showed that glycyrrhizin effectively inhibited the SARS-CoV virus replication at an early stage. They were also of opinion that glycyrrhizin affected cellular signaling pathways such as protein kinase C, casein kinase II, and transcription factors such as protein 1 and nuclear factor B. Furthermore, they also concluded the upregulation of nitrous oxide that inhibits the virus.
