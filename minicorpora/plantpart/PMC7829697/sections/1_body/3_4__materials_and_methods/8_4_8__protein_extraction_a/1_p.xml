 <sup>6</sup> cells/mL. After treatment with the indicated concentrations of the specified drugs for the indicated time points, cells were harvested and washed twice with PBS. Total protein extraction was performed by using the M-PER Mammalian Extraction Reagent from Thermo Fisher (78505) supplemented phosphatase/protease inhibitor cocktail from Thermo Fisher (78440). The protein concentration was determined by BCA Protein Assay (23252). Western blotting was performed as described previously [
