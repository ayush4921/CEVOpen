<p>The MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2
 <italic>H</italic>-tetrazolium) assay was performed to assess the impact of the drugs on cell growth using the CellTiter 96
 <sup>®</sup> AQueous One Solution following the manufacturer’s instructions from Promega Benelux (Leiden, The Netherlands). Briefly, cell plating was performed in 96-well plates at a density of 40,000 cells per well in 100 µL complete culture medium in the presence or absence of the indicated drugs. After 48 h of incubation, 20 µL of MTS was added to each well and incubated again for up to 3 h, and the absorbance was measured by using an EX Microplate Photometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at a wavelength of 490 nm. Growth inhibition was calculated by comparing the absorbance values of drug-treated cells to that of untreated controls, which was set at 100%; the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were calculated from sigmoidal dose response curves using Prism 8.2 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA).
