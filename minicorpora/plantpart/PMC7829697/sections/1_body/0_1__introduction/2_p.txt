0: The novelty and originality of our work is to assess the anticancer effect of PV-derived EO and the combination of its two main components on different AML cell lines.
1: We have also evaluated the potential synergistic effect of carvacrol and thymol combination regarding leukemic cell death.
2: Drug combinations are a well-established form of cancer treatment [ 7].
3: Administering more than one drug can provide many benefits: higher efficacy, lower toxicity, and at least delayed onset of acquired drug resistance [ 8, 9, 10].
4: Such compounds act on tumors by inducing cell death through different pathways [ 11, 12].
5: Most of the studies on the cytotoxic effects of plant bioactive components are limited to the effect of single components, while their impact is normally due to the combination of multiple components.
6: At this time, no published work has studied the effect of the combination of these two compounds on cancer cell death induction or the molecular mechanisms associated with it.
7: Our results open the door to the establishment of new anticancer therapeutic strategies for treating AML by focusing on the relevance of the combination of carvacrol and thymol in inducing a potential synergistic cell death of cancer cell lines.
