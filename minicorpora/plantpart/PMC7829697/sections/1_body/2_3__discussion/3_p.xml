<p>Collectively, these results show that the combination of carvacrol and thymol induce a potential synergistic cell-death effect against acute leukemia cells by activating apoptotic, oxidative, and reticular stress pathways. In addition, the activation of non-apoptotic pathways such as autophagy and necrosis may participate in this induced cell death. Therefore, we determined that several molecular pathways are modulated both at gene and protein levels. These results may contribute to the efforts in developing a safe and efficient anti-AML strategy based on thymol and carvacrol combination. Both of these molecules should be therapeutically evaluated using mouse models and ultimately clinical trials. For instance, there are few clinical data regarding these molecules. In this context, carvacrol has been approved as a food additive by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and added in the list of chemical flavorings by the Council of Europe. It is known that carvacrol has several pharmacological properties including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antitumor, and antimicrobial effects [

A clinical study that was conducted to assess the effect of carvacrol on respiratory symptoms in the veterans exposed to sulfur mustard (SM) showed that two months of treatment with carvacrol reduced inflammatory cytokine and chemokine but increased anti-inflammatory cytokines. Such treatment also improved respiratory symptom and forced expiratory volume—one value second in SM-exposed patients [

Another Phase II clinical trial was conducted in 2018 to examine the preventive effect of carvacrol in asthmatic patients during a 2-month treatment period. Pulmonary function tests in these carvacrol-received patients were increased, and respiratory symptoms and inflammatory parameters were reduced, which indicates its therapeutic effect on asthma [

In all of these studies, thymol pre- and co-treatment in rats appear devoid of any deleterious effects, which is suggestive of its safety [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-26-00410" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These studies recommend performing clinical trials to determine the exact dosage of thymol against cancer disease in humans. Interestingly, the effect of feeding a carvacrol–thymol blend supplemented diet was evaluated in piglets in which weaning induced intestinal oxidative stress and dysfunction of the intestinal barrier [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-26-00410" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The results indicated that dietary supplementation with carvacrol–thymol decreased the intestinal oxidative stress and influenced selected microbial populations without changing the biomarkers of intestinal barrier in weaning piglets. Therefore, it is recommended that experiments using mouse models and ultimately clinical trials are implemented to evaluate the combination of carvacrol and thymol for the management of AML. The amelioration of compound manufacturing and characterization is also an important feature for developing a safe, quality, and efficient natural therapeutic product. Comprehensive therapeutic and toxicological studies using the carvacrol–thymol combination should be conducted using animal models (e.g., leukemic mouse models) followed by well-designed clinical studies. Collectively, increasing the knowledge regarding the potential synergistic anti-tumoral mechanisms of action of the thymol and carvacrol combination will provide new onco-therapeutic perspectives for the management of AML.
