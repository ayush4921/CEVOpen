<p>As known, PV EO is mainly composed of phenolic compounds (48.0%) with carvacrol (44.6%) and thymol (3.4%) as the majors active compounds [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-26-00410" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In this part of the work, we studied the combined effect of carvacrol (car) and thymol (thy) on myeloid leukemic cell death. We first tested different concentrations of thymol and carvacrol to determine the concentrations that could be used to study their potential synergistic effect. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00410-f003">Figure 3</xref>, KG1 cell lines are very sensitive to carvacrol at 300 µM compared to the HL60 line (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00410-f004">Figure 4</xref>), while the K562 line (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00410-f005">Figure 5</xref>) shows resistance after 48 h treatment at 400 µM carvacrol. For thymol, at 50 µM, KG1 cells are sensitive compared to the other two lines. At 100 µM, thymol can induce complete cell death of KG1 and HL60 cells (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00410-f004">Figure 4</xref>), whereas around 50% of K562 cells resist cell death after 48 h of treatment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00410-f005">Figure 5</xref>). Based on these results, we tested two different concentrations of thymol (25 µM and 50 µM) and carvacrol (200 µM and 300 µM) to study their potential synergistic effect. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00410-f003">Figure 3</xref>, for the KG1 cell line, we observed the potential synergistic effect of thymol and carvacrol at the different combinations of drug concentrations after both 24 and 48 h of treatment. For the HL60 line (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00410-f004">Figure 4</xref>), the potential synergistic effect is more pronounced for the 200 µM car/50 µM thy and 300 μM car/50 µM thy combinations than in other combinations. Indeed, for this cell line, more than 80% of cells remained alive after an individual treatment of the two drugs, but their combination eliminated almost all the cancerous cells. Interestingly, for the K562 cell line (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00410-f005">Figure 5</xref>) that was less sensitive to individual concentrations of carvacrol and thymol (more than 90% viability after 48 h of treatment with 300 µM carvacrol or 50 µM thymol), the combination of the two drugs was able to kill 70% of the malignant cells. Then, we tested the toxicity of these two drugs on PBMCs from healthy donors. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00410-f006">Figure 6</xref>, carvacrol and thymol show toxicity at very high concentrations (carvacrol 400 µM and thymol 100 µM), but more than 50% of PBMCs remain viable after 48 h of treatment. Indeed, when combining the two drugs, more than 50% of the normal cells remain alive even at concentrations that are able to eliminate all KG1 and HL60 cells and more than 70% of K562-resistant cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00410-f003">Figure 3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00410-f004">Figure 4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00410-f005">Figure 5</xref>). These results suggest that much of the observed antileukemic effect of PV EO could be due to the presence of thymol and carvacrol and that the combination of the two drugs can eliminate even the K562-resistant cells, while presenting less toxicity to normal cells.
