<p>First, we treated the leukemic cell lines K562, HL60, and KG1 with different concentrations of the PV EO extract. These cell lines were selected since they partially reflect the molecular heterogeneity of myelo√Ød leukemia. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00410-f002">Figure 2</xref>, the EO of PV is capable of inducing cell death after 24 h of treatment at a concentration of 0.01% in both HL60 and KG1 cell lines (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00410-f002">Figure 2</xref>A,B). Although less sensitive at this concentration, most K562 cells are killed using a concentration of 0.02%, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00410-f002">Figure 2</xref>A,B. The K562 cell death induced by EO is associated with a high level of annexin+/PI-cells, suggesting the implication of apoptosis pathways. Interestingly, these two concentrations (0.01% and 0.02%) are not toxic to normal cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00410-f002">Figure 2</xref>B). The treatment of PBMCs isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy donors with different concentrations of HE was toxic only at very high concentrations (0.04%) (data not shown). These results show that PV EO induces cell death in HL60, KG1, and K562 at concentrations that are not toxic to normal cells.
