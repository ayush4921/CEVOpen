<p>To determine if alternative molecular mechanisms might be involved in the cell death induced by the combination of carvacrol and thymol, we first studied the dependence of this induced cell death on the caspase activation pathway and on ROS generation. The cells were treated with Z-VAD-FMK, a pan caspase inhibitor, 1 h before treatment with both drugs. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00410-f009">Figure 9</xref>A, only the HL60 line had a dependence on the caspase pathway. Indeed, in this cell line, pretreatment with a caspase inhibitor abrogated the car–thy-induced cell death. The other two cell lines showed no significant change in the cell death level following the inhibition of caspases. In addition, the use of the ROS scavenger 
 <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-
 <sc>l</sc>-cysteine (NAC) had no effect on car–thy-induced cell death in the three cell lines (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00410-f009">Figure 9</xref>B). These results suggest that the ability of the combination of the two drugs to induce other cell death pathways is independent of caspase activation and ROS generation.
