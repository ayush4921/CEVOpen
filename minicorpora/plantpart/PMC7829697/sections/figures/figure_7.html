 <caption> ( A– D) Effect of carvacrol and thymol combination in cell death induction through apoptotic and cell stress pathways. ( A). Flow cytometric analysis of cell death with Annexin V-APC/7-AAD double staining after 48 h treatment of KG1, HL60, and K562 cell lines with Thy 50µM/Cr 300 µM combination. Data were analyzed by Kaluza software 2.1. ( B) and ( C). Relative expression of genes related to apoptotic cell death. ( D) Relative expression of genes related to cell and oxidative stress pathway. Data represent the mean ± SEM of three independent experiments relative to vehicle. The levels of statistical significance as done by Anova test were set at p &lt; 0.05 (*), p &lt; 0.01 (**) and p &lt; 0.001 (***). ns: no significant. </caption>
