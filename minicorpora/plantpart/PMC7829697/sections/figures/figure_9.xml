   <bold>B</bold>) Effect of carvacrol and thymol combination in cell death induction through non-apoptotic pathways. Flow cytometric analysis of cell death with Annexin V-APC/7-AAD double staining after 48 h treatment of KG1 and HL60 cell lines with the combination of 50 µM Thy/200 µM Cr and K562 cell line with 75 µM Thy/300 µM Cr, in the presence of the pan caspase inhibitor Z-VAD (
   <bold>A</bold>) or with the ROS scavenger NAC (
   <bold>B</bold>). Data were analyzed by Kaluza software 2.1. The levels of statistical significance as done by Anova test were set at 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 (***). ns: no significant.
