0: We gathered the published literature on plants with anthelmintic/scolicidal activity against protoscoleces of  E.  granulosus.
1: The purpose of this review is to better understand the current trends in research addressing the development of new scolicidal agents from plant sources.
2: The findings of this review could help to provide up to date knowledge concerning scolicidal potential of medicinal plants and to exploit existing knowledge gaps to improve future research by recognizing areas where more focus should be given.
