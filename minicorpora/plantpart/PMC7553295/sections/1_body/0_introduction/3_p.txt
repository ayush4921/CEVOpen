0: Treatment of the disease depends on stage, size, location, and complications of the cysts.
1: At present, four treatment modalities are in practice for CE: surgery (the only treatment until the 1980s), chemotherapy with synthetic drugs like benzimidazole compounds, puncture aspiration injection and re-aspiration (PAIR), and the watch and wait method for clinically silent and inactive cysts [ 9].
2: However, these treatment methods have significant limitations.
3: Some of the chemotherapeutic drugs used against CE are only used for inoperable cysts, though 2040% cases do not respond favorably to those drugs and there are many related adverse effects [ 10].
4: During surgical practices, there is a high risk of intraoperative release of cystic fluids that subsequently results in secondary infection and relapse of hydatid cysts in approximately 10% of the cases [ 4].
5: To minimize the risk of recurrence the use of active scolicidal agents is indispensable [ 10].
6: Recently, it has been shown that existing scolicidal agents like cetrimide, ethanol, hypertonic saline, silver nitrate and others are related to severe side effects such as sclerosing cholangitis [ 11].
7: In traditional and rural settings, natural compounds from medicinal plants are being used as a remedy against CE because they are easily available and are thought to be efficacious while presenting fewer adverse side effects [ 12].
8: There are indeed a large number of medicinal plants whose scolicidal activity has been demonstrated against the protoscoleces of  E.  granulosus, however, there are many more plants which have not been explored yet.
