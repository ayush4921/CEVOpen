<p id="Par34">The establishment of an efficient and inexpensive method for 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> multiplication of tansy is a promising starting point for the introduction of high-capacity bioreactors and mass micropropagation of shoots and roots for stabile secondary metabolites production. In addition, well-developed protocols open up new directions for research that could affect secondary metabolite production by the manipulation of chemical and physical cultivation conditions, application of precursors and/or elicitors, or genetic transformation that would affect the expression of genes from the biosynthetic pathway of the target compound. The significance of these results is even higher since studies related to the in vitro root cultures or leaf secretory structures of 
 <italic>Tanacetum vulgare</italic> are not available to our knowledge. EO and methanol extract obtained from in vitro grown tansy qualitatively and quantitatively differed from the previously analyzed wild-grown plants, being the source of new mixtures shown to be rich in biologically active compounds. Further investigation will be directed toward the optimization of in vitro cultivation conditions, including elicitation, for obtaining maximum production of tansy secondary metabolites and the elucidation of their pharmaceutical potential, as mixtures or single moieties.
