<p id="Par7">In general, this species is insufficiently investigated since it is endowed with an array of valuable phytochemicals. It is well known for its impressive chemical diversity with more than 30 chemotypes identified by dominant terpenoids (Keskitalo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2001</xref>; Rohloff et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2004</xref>; Wolf et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2012</xref>). Additionally, there are limited data regarding suitable micropropagation techniques for its in vitro cultivation, and only procedures for the regeneration of petiole and leaf explants and the production of protoplast-derived callus have been reported (Keskitalo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1995</xref>). Our previous research (Devrnja et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2017</xref>) highlighted the phytochemicals in essential oil and methanol extracts from wild-growing tansy plants that manifested strong antioxidant and antimicrobial activity. Special attention was given to its anticancer properties and in vitro results showed a high antiproliferative effect in the micrograms range (up to 100 Î¼g/mL) on human cervical adenocarcinoma (HeLa) cells.
