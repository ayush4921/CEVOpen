<p id="Par6">Relying on information coming from traditional medicine, we aimed to investigate the phytochemical properties of 
 <italic>Tanacetum vulgare</italic> L. (tansy, 
 <italic>Asteraceae</italic>/Compositae). This aromatic perennial herb is a native of Europe. Its generic name, 
 <italic>Tanacetum</italic>, comes from the Greek word “

Since then, tansy has broadly been used in traditional medicines worldwide for the treatment of a variety of medical disorders, such as intestinal worms, rheumatism, colds and fevers, digestive disorders, epileptic seizures, hysteria, gout, kidney problems, and tuberculosis. Many laboratory reports have claimed that essential oils and extracts of tansy display a wide range of biological activities, including antioxidant, antimicrobial, insecticidal, cytotoxic, antivirus, and anti-inflammatory activities (Mordujovich-Buschiazzo et al.
