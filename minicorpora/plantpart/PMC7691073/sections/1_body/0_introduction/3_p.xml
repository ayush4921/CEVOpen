<p id="Par4">In parallel, drug formulations of complex partly purified plant extracts have become equally adopted as “single-molecule” medicines. This approach relies on traditional medicine experiences, where complex mixtures of plant compounds were used for the treatment of different health problems without any knowledge about the contained bioactive compounds. In 2008, the first botanical extract, Veregen®, an enriched extract of polyphenols from green tea (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2018</xref>). One of the issues is the intrinsic variability of plant material caused by environmental factors (i.e., actual climate, harvesting time, soil composition, altitude, storage conditions) and/or biotic interactions occurring in natural populations before harvest. This can cause significantly altered phytochemical composition of obtained extracts, as well as low yields of targeted products and high abundance and toxicity of some active compounds.
