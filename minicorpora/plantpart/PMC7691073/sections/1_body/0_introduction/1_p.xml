<p id="Par2">The current pharmacological industry mostly relies on synthetic drugs, due to the intensive development of a computational approach, combinatorial chemistry techniques, and instruments during the second half of the twentieth century (Liu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2017</xref>). Despite what was expected, the rate of new chemically synthesized pharmaceuticals reaching the market has continually decreased, with only 24.6% of the 1881 new drugs approved from 1981 to 2019 obtained synthetically (Newman and Cragg 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2020</xref>). This has forced the pharmaceutical industry recurrently turn to natural products, compounds derived from microorganisms, plants, and animals used in traditional medicine for thousands of years. Among them, secondary metabolites of plants make the most promising pool of potential pharmacological drugs. From the total number of plant species discovered so far, approximately 20% have been screened for biologically active compounds, and about 135 registered drugs have been approved (Newman et al.
