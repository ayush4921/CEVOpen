0: Relying on information coming from traditional medicine, we aimed to investigate the phytochemical properties of  Tanacetum vulgare L. (tansy,  Asteraceae/Compositae).
1: This aromatic perennial herb is a native of Europe.
2: Its generic name,  Tanacetum, comes from the Greek word  athanatos meaning immortality.
3: In ancient times, the unique rejuvenating powers and ability to preserve dead bodies from corruption were ascribed to its long-lasting flowers (Mitich  1992).
4: Since then, tansy has broadly been used in traditional medicines worldwide for the treatment of a variety of medical disorders, such as intestinal worms, rheumatism, colds and fevers, digestive disorders, epileptic seizures, hysteria, gout, kidney problems, and tuberculosis.
5: Many laboratory reports have claimed that essential oils and extracts of tansy display a wide range of biological activities, including antioxidant, antimicrobial, insecticidal, cytotoxic, antivirus, and anti-inflammatory activities (Mordujovich-Buschiazzo et al.
6: 1996; Onozato et al.
7: 2009; Rosselli et al.
8: 2012; Gospodinova et al.
9: 2014; Devrnja et al.
10: 2017).
11: A purified complex extract of flavonoids and phenol carbonic acids from tansy flowers, commercially known as Tanacechol, is registered in Russia as a choleretic and spasmolytic agent for chronic cholecystitis and biliary dyskinesia (Karabaeva et al.
12: 2015).
13: Septimeb TM, an herbal extract including  T. vulgare (tansy),  Rosa canina (dog rose), and  Urtica dioica (stinging nettle) in addition to selenium, flavonoids, and carotenes, showed positive effects on the reduction of sepsis severity (Pourdast et al.
14: 2017).
15: The weaker version of this mixture, named Setarud (IMODTM), was proposed as an immunomodulator in the treatment of HIV-positive patients (Paydary et al.
16: 2012).
