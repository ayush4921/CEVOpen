0: The current pharmacological industry mostly relies on synthetic drugs, due to the intensive development of a computational approach, combinatorial chemistry techniques, and instruments during the second half of the twentieth century (Liu et al.
1: 2017).
2: Despite what was expected, the rate of new chemically synthesized pharmaceuticals reaching the market has continually decreased, with only 24.6% of the 1881 new drugs approved from 1981 to 2019 obtained synthetically (Newman and Cragg  2020).
3: This has forced the pharmaceutical industry recurrently turn to natural products, compounds derived from microorganisms, plants, and animals used in traditional medicine for thousands of years.
4: Among them, secondary metabolites of plants make the most promising pool of potential pharmacological drugs.
5: From the total number of plant species discovered so far, approximately 20% have been screened for biologically active compounds, and about 135 registered drugs have been approved (Newman et al.
6: 2003; David et al.
7: 2015).
