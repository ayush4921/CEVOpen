0: This study aimed to investigate the potential of tansy plants to produce valuable chemicals by in vitro culture.
1: The general aims were to establish both shoot and root cultures of tansy and to analyze the phytochemical composition of obtained essential oil and methanol extracts with histochemical analyses of production sites.
2: Comparing the composition of metabolites mixtures from in vitro grown plants with those obtained from wild-grown parental plants will indicate the sustainability of the proposed thesis that in vitro cultures could provide an efficient tool for the production of innovative pharmaceutical drugs from tansy metabolites in controlled conditions.
