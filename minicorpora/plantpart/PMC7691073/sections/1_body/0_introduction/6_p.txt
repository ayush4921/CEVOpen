0: In general, this species is insufficiently investigated since it is endowed with an array of valuable phytochemicals.
1: It is well known for its impressive chemical diversity with more than 30 chemotypes identified by dominant terpenoids (Keskitalo et al.
2: 2001; Rohloff et al.
3: 2004; Wolf et al.
4: 2012).
5: Additionally, there are limited data regarding suitable micropropagation techniques for its in vitro cultivation, and only procedures for the regeneration of petiole and leaf explants and the production of protoplast-derived callus have been reported (Keskitalo et al.
6: 1995).
7: Our previous research (Devrnja et al.
8: 2017) highlighted the phytochemicals in essential oil and methanol extracts from wild-growing tansy plants that manifested strong antioxidant and antimicrobial activity.
9: Special attention was given to its anticancer properties and in vitro results showed a high antiproliferative effect in the micrograms range (up to 100 g/mL) on human cervical adenocarcinoma (HeLa) cells.
