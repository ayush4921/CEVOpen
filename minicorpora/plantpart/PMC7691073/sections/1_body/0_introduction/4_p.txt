0: The employment of in vitro cultivation of plants is among the biotechnological solutions favored by researchers.
1: The establishment of in vitro multiplication protocols enables the production of uniform plant material and controlled manipulation with environmental conditions, plant growth regulators, and elicitation strategies that can boost the production and overall yield of phytochemicals.
2: Growing plants under controlled environmental conditions (temperature, light intensity, and duration), on growing media prepared according to strict recipes for plants nutritional necessities, showed to be good practice for avoiding the instability in chemical composition that naturally occurs (Robles and Garzino  2000; Demetzos et al.
3: 2002).
4: Strictly aseptic conditions prevent the presence of unexpected compounds synthesized by endophytic fungi and/or bacteria or produced by plants as a result of the interaction with them (David et al.
5: 2015), or harmful residues of pesticides that are often present in plants collected from nature.
6: While intensive wild-crafting and unsustainable harvesting techniques of either whole plants or their particular organs could bring about their persistence and sustainability in natural habitats and even make plant populations threatened (Cordell  2011), in vitro micropropagation techniques offer a proper alternative for the cultivation of valuable plants and large-scale production of targeted metabolites.
