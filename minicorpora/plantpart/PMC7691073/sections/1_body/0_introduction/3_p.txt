0: In parallel, drug formulations of complex partly purified plant extracts have become equally adopted as single-molecule medicines.
1: This approach relies on traditional medicine experiences, where complex mixtures of plant compounds were used for the treatment of different health problems without any knowledge about the contained bioactive compounds.
2: In 2008, the first botanical extract, Veregen, an enriched extract of polyphenols from green tea ( Camellia sinensis), was approved in the USA for the treatment of genital warts caused by the human papilloma virus (Scheinfeld  2008).
3: Although there is no doubt that these herbal mixtures provide a synergism of positive effects (Arora and Koul  2014), many of the regulatory approval processes were impeded for various reasons (Chugh et al.
4: 2018).
5: One of the issues is the intrinsic variability of plant material caused by environmental factors (i.e., actual climate, harvesting time, soil composition, altitude, storage conditions) and/or biotic interactions occurring in natural populations before harvest.
6: This can cause significantly altered phytochemical composition of obtained extracts, as well as low yields of targeted products and high abundance and toxicity of some active compounds.
