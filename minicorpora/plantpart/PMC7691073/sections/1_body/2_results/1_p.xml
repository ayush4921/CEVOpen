<p id="Par21">After 15 days, the percentage of germinated tansy seeds was 97.8% (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a, b</xref>). Grown on BM, seedlings developed 4–5 leaves and a branched root system in 4 weeks (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). The in vitro grown tansy plants displayed a typical tansy phenotype with alternate and pinnately lobed leaf morphology (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). Healthy looking seedlings were used for the establishment of both shoot and root cultures on solid or liquid BM, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d, e</xref>). After 4 weeks of cultivation on solid BM, average shoot length was 48.54 ± 0.2 mm, without any lateral branching. The roots cultivated in liquid BM increased their weight 3 times (from an initial 400 mg to 1.2 ± 0.03 g average). After 7 days of air-drying period, the roots’ weight was decreased with average FW/DW index = 6.02 ± 0.05.
