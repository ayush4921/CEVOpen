<p id="Par27">Results of the GC-MS analysis of the essential oil are presented in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. The essential oil of in vitro tansy plantlets was composed of 88 volatile compounds of which 42 were identified, representing 72.3% of the total oil. Only four compounds were made up by more than 5% of the total oil and 14 volatiles were present only in traces (&lt; 0.1%). The monoterpenes were the most abundant compounds (40%), followed by sesquiterpenes (33.4%). All identified compounds belonging to six chemical groups: oxygenated monoterpenes (38.5%), monoterpene hydrocarbons (&lt; 0.7%), oxygenated sesquiterpenes (22.6%), sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (10.6%), aromatic hydrocarbons (0.2%), and aromatic alcohols (&lt; 0.2%). The oxygenated monoterpene trans-thujone (22.7%) and oxygenated sesquiterpene neryl-isovalerate (20.6%) were the dominant compounds in the oil.
