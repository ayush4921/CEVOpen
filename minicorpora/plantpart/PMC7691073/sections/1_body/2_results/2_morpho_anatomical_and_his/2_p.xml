<p id="Par23">The anatomical investigation of leaf cross-sections by light microscopy revealed a isobilateral leaf type with an upper and lower epidermis with stomata cells, palisade, and spongy mesophyll (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a, b</xref>). The epidermis consisted of a single layer of cells and was covered with a thin cuticle layer. Photosynthetic tissue was represented as 1–2 layers of palisade tissue cells and 2–3 layers of loosely, spongy mesophyll tissue with closed, collateral vascular bundles (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Biseriate glandular trichomes were in various stages of development and consisted of two basal cells placed in the epidermis, one pair of cells forming a short stalk and three to four pairs of cells forming the secretory head (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). The cuticle layer over the secretory head expanded and formed the subcuticular space.
