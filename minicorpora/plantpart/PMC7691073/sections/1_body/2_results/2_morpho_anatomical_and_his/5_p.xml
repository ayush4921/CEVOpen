<p id="Par26">Polysaccharides in the secretory cells and subcuticular space were stained pink-red (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3i</xref>). This reaction was positive with insoluble polysaccharides of non-glandular trichomes and epidermal cell polysaccharides. Drops of secretion localized in the secretory cells of the glandular head emitted intense autofluorescence under UV excitation (Fig.
