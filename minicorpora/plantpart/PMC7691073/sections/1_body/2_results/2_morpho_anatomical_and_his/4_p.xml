<p id="Par25">On the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> leaf surface, biseriate trichomes with secretions in the subcuticular space were observed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). The histochemical staining showed that the secretion contained lipophilic substances (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d, e</xref>). In the glandular secretions localized in the subcuticular space, neutral lipids/essential oils were also detected (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>). The terpenoids, represented as dark violet droplets, referred to as essential oils, were localized in the secretory cells and subcuticular space (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3g, h</xref>).
