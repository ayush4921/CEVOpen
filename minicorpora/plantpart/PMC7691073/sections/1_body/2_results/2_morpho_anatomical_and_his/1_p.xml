<p id="Par22">Both adaxial and abaxial surfaces of leaf indumentum consisted of non-glandular and glandular trichomes. Long, uniseriate non-glandular trichomes were more frequent on the abaxial leaf surface (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2aâ€“d</xref>). The biseriate glandular trichomes were observed in tansy grown in vitro (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e, f</xref>). The surface of immature biseriate glands appears wrinkled, indicative of the close attachment of the cuticle to the secretory upper cell walls (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). During maturation, the gland surface became smoother as the secretory products accumulated within the developing subcuticular space formed by a detachment of the cuticle (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>).
