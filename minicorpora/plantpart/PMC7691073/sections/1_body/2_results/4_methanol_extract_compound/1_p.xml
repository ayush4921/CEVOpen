<p id="Par28">The HPLC chromatograms recorded at 280 nm revealed differences between the chemical compositions of methanol extracts derived from native tansy and from tansy cultured in vitro (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Based on characteristic UV spectra, flavonoids and phenolic acids were detected, while chlorogenic acid (CGA) and 3,5-
 <italic>O</italic>-dicaffeoylquinic acid (3,5-
 <italic>O</italic>-DCQA) were identified in all extracts tested. The highest content of CGA and 3,5-
 <italic>O</italic>-DCQA was recorded in the methanol extract of roots grown in vitro (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). The amount of 3,5-
 <italic>O</italic>-DCQA was up to 6 times higher in the methanol extract of in vitro roots (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>; 10.220 mg/g DW) compared with methanol extract of native tansy roots (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>; 1.684 mg/g DW). The methanol extracts of tansy aerial parts from native (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>) and in vitro plants (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>) were characterized by relatively similar amounts of the acid (2.274 mg/g DW and 3.579 mg/g DW, respectively).
