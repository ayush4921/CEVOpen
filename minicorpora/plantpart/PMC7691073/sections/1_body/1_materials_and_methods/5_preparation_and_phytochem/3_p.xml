<p id="Par20">High-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) of the methanol extracts was carried out on an Agilent 1100 chromatograph with a column compartment equipped with a Zorbax SB-C18 analytical column (150 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm, Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) and diode array detector. The mobile phase consisted of a 1% (v/v) solution of orthophosphoric acid in water (A) and acetonitrile (B). The flow rate of the mobile phase was 0.8 mL/min, and the injection volume was 10 μL. A gradient program was used as follows: 90–75% A, 0–30 min, 75–45% A, 30–40 min, 45–0% A, 40–50 min. The chromatograms were recorded at 280 nm and 360 nm. Identification of 3,5-
 <italic>O</italic>-dicaffeoylquinic acid and chlorogenic acid was confirmed by the co-injection method using commercial standard samples purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The content of 3,5-
 <italic>O</italic>-DCQA and chlorogenic acid was determined by the external standard quantification method.
