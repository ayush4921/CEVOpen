<p id="Par16">Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of essential oils was performed on an Agilent Technologies 7890 A GC system equipped with 5975 CInert MSD and flame ionization detector (FID). The GC system was equipped with the split-splitless injector and HP-5MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25-μm film thickness). Helium was the carrier gas, and its flow rate was 3 mL/min. The ion source energy was 70 eV and chromatographic conditions were as follows: column temperature was linearly programmed from 60 to 300 °C (at the rate of 3 °C/min) and held isothermally at 300 °C next 10 min; injector temperature was 250 °C; ion source temperature was 230 °C; and quadrupole temperature was 150 °C.</p>
