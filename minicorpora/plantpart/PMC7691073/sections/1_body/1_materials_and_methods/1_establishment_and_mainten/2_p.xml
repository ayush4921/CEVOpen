 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">1962</xref>) macro and micro mineral salts, 2% sucrose, 100 mg/L myo-inositol, and LS (Linsmaier and Skoog 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">1965</xref>) vitamins, and was solidified with 0.7% (w/v) agar (Torlak, Belgrade, Serbia). The pH of the medium was adjusted to 5.5 before sterilization in an autoclave at 114 °C (80 kPa) for 25 min. The seeds were germinated under controlled conditions of 24 ± 2 °C, 16-h light/8-h dark photoperiod, and under cool white fluorescent light with a photosynthetic photon flux rate of 40 μmol/(m
 <sup>2</sup>s), as measured by an LI-1400 DataLogger equipped with an LI-190SA Quantum sensor, LICOR Biosciences.
