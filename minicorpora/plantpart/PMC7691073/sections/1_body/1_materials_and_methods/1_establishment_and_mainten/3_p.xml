<p id="Par11">When the resulting axenic seedlings fully developed 4–5 leaves and a branched root system, they were used as donor material for shoot multiplication. Micro shoots were sub-cultured on fresh BM in glass 100-mL Erlenmeyer flasks every 4 weeks, and material for phytochemical analyses was collected continuously. In parallel, roots excised from the plantlets rooted spontaneously on BM were used for the establishment of in vitro root cultures. Roots were transferred into Erlenmeyer flasks (400 mg in each) with 100-mL liquid half-strength BM (½ BM; with reduced content of MS components) and maintained on a horizontal shaker (90 rpm) under the aforementioned conditions with reduced light (2 μmol/(m
 <sup>2</sup>s)). After 4 weeks in culture, roots were removed from the medium and dried on filter paper to remove any adherent culture medium and air-dried for further phytochemical analyses.
