<p id="Par9">Seeds collected from a native population (from the Ada Huja locality, Belgrade, Serbia) were used for in vitro culture establishment. The seeds were washed in tap water containing 2â€“3 drops of liquid commercial detergent for 30 min and rinsed three times with sterile distilled water. Washed seeds were then surface sterilized using a 30% solution of commercial bleach (4% NaClO) for 30 min, and 15% bleach for 15 min, and subsequently rinsed three times with sterile distilled water for 10 min. Seeds dried on sterile filter paper were aseptically placed in 90-mm Petri dishes (20 seeds per dish) containing 25 mL of basal medium (BM) for germination.</p>
