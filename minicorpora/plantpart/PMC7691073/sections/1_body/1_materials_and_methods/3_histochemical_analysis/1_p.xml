<p id="Par14">To detect the presence of secondary metabolites in secretory cells of trichomes, the second and third fresh leaves were hand-sectioned and the following histochemical staining methods were used: Sudan Black B, Sudan IV, and Sudan Red 7B/hematoxylin for total lipids (Jensen 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">1962</xref>); Nile Blue A for neutral and acidic lipids (Cain 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1947</xref>); Nadi reagent for terpenoids (David and Carde 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1964</xref>); periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) reagent for polysaccharides (Jensen 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">1962</xref>); Ruthenium Red for pectins (Johansen 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">1940</xref>); Wagner (Furr and Mahlberg 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1981</xref>), Dragendorf (Svendsen and Verpoorte 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">1983</xref>) and Ellram (Furr and Mahlberg 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1981</xref>) reagents for alkaloids; ferric chloride (FeCl
 <sub>3</sub>) for polyphenols (Gahan 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1984</xref>); and Toluidine Blue O for lignins and tannins (Baker 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1966</xref>). Following the methods of specific authors, standard control procedures were carried out simultaneously for all histochemical methods used. Observations were made on a Zeiss Axiovert microscope. The autofluorescence investigation was carried out using the same instrument.
