<p id="Par30">Light and SEM microscopy of the leaf surface of in vitro micropropagated tansy plants revealed the presence of glandular biseriate trichomes randomly distributed on both adaxial and abaxial leaf surfaces. These were surrounded by long non-glandular ones, which are known to be typical for all species belonging to the 
 <italic>Asteraceae</italic> family (Ciccarelli et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2007</xref>). Glandular trichomes were also present on the tansy stems. In many cases, glandular trichomes were abundant on both in vitro gentle leaf surfaces, while in aged ex vitro leaves, these structures were only present on the abaxial surface (Bandyopadhyay et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2004</xref>). Frequent in vitro sub-culturing practices in tansy, which occur every 4 weeks, could be responsible for retarding plantlets in the juvenile stage and prevent trichome distribution related to the maturation process.
