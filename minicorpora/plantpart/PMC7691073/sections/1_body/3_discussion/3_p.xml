<p id="Par31">The presence of storage glands is intrinsically associated with terpenoid metabolism (Maffei 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2010</xref>), which was confirmed by histochemical analysis of in vitro tansy leaves. Glandular secretions were rich in lipid and terpene compounds, which was also confirmed by GC-MS analysis of EO. Tansy biseriate trichomes contained a storage subcuticular space in which volatile compounds were retained in their liquid state, like in other representatives of the 
 <italic>Asteraceae</italic> family (Turner et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2000</xref>). The morphology of these trichomes is adapted for the fast release of volatile defense compounds upon herbivory attack or other mechanical damage. During the first decades of the twenty-first century, special attention was given to the investigation of site-specific regulation of synthesis machinery for plant secondary metabolites (Lange et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2011</xref>; Tissier 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2012a</xref>; Sultana et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2015</xref>). Impressive progress has been made in the identification of promoters driving trichome-specific gene expression, which could be used to control trichome density and, consequently, to improve the productivity of EOs or even some particular constituents (Tissier 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2012b</xref>). The recorded presence of numerous, highly metabolically active biseriate trichomes on the surface of in vitro grown tansy could be the starting point for the utilization of obtained knowledge.
