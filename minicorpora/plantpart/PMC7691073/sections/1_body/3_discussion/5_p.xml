<p id="Par33">Quantity and quality variations were reflected also in the chemical profile of methanol extracts of in vitro cultured tansy herbs and roots compared to wild-grown tansy. In both in vitro and native plant material, extracts were rich in phenolics and flavonoids. The strong antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anticancer potential of tansy extracts obtained from wild-grown plants were attributed to these compounds (Devrnja et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2017</xref>). The most striking differences were observed for 3,5-
 <italic>O</italic>-DCQA, one of the dicaffeoylquinic acid derivatives with two caffeic acid moieties substituted at the 3 and 5 positions of the quinic acid. Results indicated that the methanol extract of in vitro cultured roots was the richest in 3,5-
 <italic>O</italic>-DCQA content, whose concentration was 6 times higher than that in the extract obtained from roots of wild-growing tansy. This is a noticeable result in the manner of industrial production of biologically active 3,5-
 <italic>O</italic>-DCQA, which has been shown to have antioxidant, hepatoprotective, antimutagenic, and immunomodulatory activity (Peluso et al.

 <italic>O</italic>-DCQA improves pancreatic function in type 2 diabetic mice (Yin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2018</xref>) and is a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 integrase, an enzyme that is essential for viral replication and subsequent HIV infection of humans (Tamura et al.
