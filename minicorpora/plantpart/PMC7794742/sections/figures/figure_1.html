 <caption> Results of a principal component analysis (PCA) from ESIHRMS data, illustrating the relationship between samples of A. rosiodora from FLONA and RESEX reserves. ( A) The score plot and ( B) the PCA derived loading plot, presenting the contribution of RT/( m/ z) data with cumulative 82% variance within the two components (PC1 and PC2). Samples are coded by “locality_tissue type”, with R = RESEX, F = FLONA, B = bark, S = stems, and L = leaves. </caption>
