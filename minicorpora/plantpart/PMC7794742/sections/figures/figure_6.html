 <caption> The 50% majority rule tree from Bayesian analysis of a concatenated dataset of plastid psbA– trhH, psbD– trnT, trnC– rpoB, and trnS– trnG. Branch support values are Bayesian posterior probabilities ≥0.5/maximum parsimony bootstrap ≥50%. The dashed line indicates a branch that was present in the Bayesian topology, but not in the Maximum Parsimony tree. </caption>
