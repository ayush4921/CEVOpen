  <italic>Aniba rosiodora</italic> has been exploited since the end of the nineteenth century for its essential oil, a valuable ingredient in the perfumery industry. This species occurs mainly in Northern South America, and the morphological similarity among different 
  <italic>Aniba</italic> species often leads to misidentification, which impacts the consistency of products obtained from these plants. Hence, we compared the profiles of volatile organic compounds (essential oils) and non-volatile organic compounds (methanolic extracts) of two populations of 
  <italic>A. rosiodora</italic> from the RESEX and FLONA conservation units, which are separated by the Tapajós River in Western Pará State. The phytochemical profile indicated a substantial difference between the two populations: samples from RESEX present α-phellandrene (22.8%) and linalool (39.6%) in their essential oil composition, while samples from FLONA contain mainly linalool (83.7%). The comparison between phytochemical profiles and phylogenetic data indicates a clear difference, implying genetic distinction between these populations.
