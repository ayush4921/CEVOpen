<p>Bayesian inference analysis was performed using MrBayes 3.2.2 [

 <xref rid="B35-molecules-26-00069" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The nucleotide substitution model [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-26-00069" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] (F81) was selected using MrModeltest 2.2 [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-26-00069" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. MrBayes was run for 10,000,000 generations, with one tree sampled every 1000 generations and all other settings as the defaults. The first 25% of trees were discarded as burn-in before constructing the majority rule consensus tree and calculating posterior probabilities. Maximum parsimony analyses were performed using PAUP* 4.0a166 [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-26-00069" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] using an exhaustive search with default parameters. Bootstrap values for nodes were estimated from a “branch and bound” search of 5000 replicates.
