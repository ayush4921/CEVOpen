<p>Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses were performed using 10 mg of MeOH extract dissolved in 800 µL of CDCl
 <sub>3</sub> (99.8% Cambridge Isotopes Laboratories TM) containing 0.05% TMS (tetramethylsilane). The 
 <sup>1</sup>H-NMR (Bruker DPX 200 MHz) spectra were obtained operating at a hydrogen NMR frequency of 200.13 MHz with a 5 mm probe. The spectra consisted of 256 scans and 300 k data points, with a pulse width of 8.0 µs (30°) and a relaxation delay of 1.0 s. The processing of the spectra was performed in the MestReNova (version 6.0.2-5475) program by automatic Fourier transformation using a line broadening of 0.3 Hz. TMS was used as an internal standard, and the residual hydrogen signal of CDCl
 <sub>3</sub> was referenced at 7.26 ppm. The integration of the spectra signals was carried out into regions of equal width (0.05 ppm) of the region δ 3.00–9.50 ppm. The region containing residues of chloroform (7.0 to 7.4 ppm) was excluded from each spectrum. The multivariate analysis was performed using Unscrambler software version 10 (CAMO Analytics).
