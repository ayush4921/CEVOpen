<p>One hundred grams of fresh cut aerial parts (leaves and thin branches approximately 6 mm in diameter) of specimens from FLONA (5 individuals) and RESEX (10 individuals) were extracted in triplicate (300 g total), by hydrodistillation for 3 h using a Clevenger apparatus in proportion 1:10 (

 <xref rid="B25-molecules-26-00069" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and the humidity of the samples was determined in triplicate using a thermogravimetric moisture analyzer balance (Celtac model DHS-16 A). The average humidity was 49.02% and 58.05% for the FLONA and RESEX samples, respectively. GC-MS analyses were performed using an Agilent instrument (model 6850, Santa Clara, CA, USA) with a DB-5HT capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm, film thickness 0.10 µm). The initial oven temperature was 66 °C, which was increased by 5 °C/min to 220 °C. The injector and detector temperatures were 250 °C and 230 °C, respectively. The sample was injected using a split ratio of 50:1. The electron impact was set to 70 eV and was monitored in the range of 20 to 500
