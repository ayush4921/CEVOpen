<p>Analysis of the non-volatile chemical profiles by HPLC-ESI-Q-Tof/MS provided further evidence for differentiating between 
 <italic>A. rosiodora</italic> samples from FLONA and RESEX. See 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-00069">Supplementary Figure S1</xref> for base peak chromatogram (BPC) of FLONA and RESEX samples. Principal component analysis (PCA) of these data showed that PC-1 largely explained the variation in these data (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00069-f001">Figure 1</xref>A). The main compound responsible for differentiating samples from FLONA (RT 7.99 min) had a quasi-molecular ion at m/z 204.0649, calculated for C
 <sub>11</sub>H
 <sub>9</sub>NO
 <sub>3</sub> [M + H]
 <sup>+</sup> 204.0655 and was assigned to the structure of the pyrone anibine (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00069-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). The fragmentation of this compound exhibits three key ions: 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 176.0702 corresponding to the loss of CO, the fragmentary ion at 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 144.0440 results from the loss of CO + CH
 <sub>4</sub>O, and 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 172.0388 resulting from the loss of CH
 <sub>4</sub>O (
