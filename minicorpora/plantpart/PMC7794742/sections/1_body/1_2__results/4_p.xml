<p>The PCA also indicated the distinction in the chemical profiles of bark samples from other tissues for FLONA samples, described by PC-2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00069-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). This difference is due to the presence of reticuline, a benzylisoquinoline alkaloid in the trunk of 
 <italic>Aniba</italic> species [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-26-00069" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The isomers of reticuline were identified at RT 3.29 and 2.10 min by 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 192.1012, which resulted from the fragmentation of [M + H]
 <sup>+</sup> 330.1700 corresponding to reticuline (C
 <sub>19</sub>H
 <sub>23</sub>NO
 <sub>4</sub>; calculated [M + H]
 <sup>+</sup> 330.1699). The fragmentations indicated the initial loss of methylamine, forming an ion of m/z 299.1272, followed by fragmentation of the benzyl moiety (
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 137.0590). The stable naphthalene ion (
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 175.0741) was formed from the rearrangement of the ion 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 299. The benzylisoquinoline ion (
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 192.1012) was formed directly from the quasi-molecular ion [M + H]
 <sup>+</sup>, and it was the diagnostic ion for this type of alkaloid (
