<p>The topologies of the Bayesian majority rule consensus tree and the maximum parsimony strict consensus of the two most parsimonious trees were not in conflict and differed in only one instances of resolution (

 <italic>Aniba rosiodora</italic> was resolved as monophyletic with strong support in the Bayesian analysis, but only had moderate support from maximum parsimony. Within 
 <italic>A. rosiodora</italic>, the two accessions from RESEX were supported as a clade that is sister to a moderately supported clade of accessions from FLONA, Presidente Figueiredo, and Manaus. In the analysis, 
 <italic>A. rosiodora</italic> was sister to a clade formed by 
 <italic>A. cinnamomiflora</italic> and 
 <italic>A. hypoglauca</italic>. In all analyses, the samples from RESEX formed a lineage separate from all other
