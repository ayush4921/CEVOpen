 <italic>Aniba rosiodora</italic> collected from the eastern and western sides of the Tapajós River revealed different profiles of essential oil and non-volatile compounds. The hydrodistillation of the aerial parts of plants yielded an average of 2.04% (±0.24) and 0.85% (±0.14) (dry weight) of essential oils for FLONA and RESEX samples, respectively. The volatile composition was also strikingly different for samples collected in each location (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00069-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). For example, samples from FLONA contained a relatively low diversity of volatile components, with linalool being the most abundant at 83.7%. In contrast, samples from RESEX presented more evenly distributed components consisting predominately of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. The abundance of linalool was only 39.6% in the RESEX samples, followed by α-phellandrene at 22.8%, which was absent in the FLONA samples.
