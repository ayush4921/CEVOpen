<p>To explore the intraspecific diversity of essential oils among populations from different locations, we collected specimens of 
 <italic>A. rosiodora</italic> from two different areas in the state of Par치: Floresta Nacional do Tapaj칩s (FLONA) and Reserva Extrativista Tapaj칩s-Arapiuns (RESEX). An integrated approach was employed using multivariate analyses to identify the essential oil and non-volatile components that best describe the phytochemical variety in these populations [

 <xref rid="B15-molecules-26-00069" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In view of confounding morphological similarity between 
 <italic>Aniba</italic> species, we examined the patterns of phytochemical variation in the context of a molecular phylogeny to understand how the populations of 
 <italic>A. rosiodora</italic> are related to each other and to other 
 <italic>Aniba</italic> species from the area. Thus, the goals of this study were to (1) examine the variation in essential oil composition among populations of 
 <italic>A. rosiodora</italic>, (2) compare non-volatile compounds from leaves, stems, and bark of two 
 <italic>A. rosiodora</italic> populations separated by the Tapaj칩s River, and (3) examine the patterns of essential oil and non-volatile compound compositions in a molecular phylogenetic framework.
