0: To explore the intraspecific diversity of essential oils among populations from different locations, we collected specimens of  A. rosiodora from two different areas in the state of Para: Floresta Nacional do Tapajos (FLONA) and Reserva Extrativista Tapajos-Arapiuns (RESEX).
1: An integrated approach was employed using multivariate analyses to identify the essential oil and non-volatile components that best describe the phytochemical variety in these populations [ 14, 15].
2: In view of confounding morphological similarity between  Aniba species, we examined the patterns of phytochemical variation in the context of a molecular phylogeny to understand how the populations of  A. rosiodora are related to each other and to other  Aniba species from the area.
3: Thus, the goals of this study were to (1) examine the variation in essential oil composition among populations of  A. rosiodora, (2) compare non-volatile compounds from leaves, stems, and bark of two  A. rosiodora populations separated by the Tapajos River, and (3) examine the patterns of essential oil and non-volatile compound compositions in a molecular phylogenetic framework.
