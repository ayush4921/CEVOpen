<p>Several studies indicate that the volatile organic compound makeup of rosewood varies from one population to another [

 <xref rid="B10-molecules-26-00069" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. A number of varieties within rosewood have been recognized in the past, but are all currently considered synonyms of a single species,

 <xref rid="B5-molecules-26-00069" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Due to extreme difficulties in distinguishing specimens based on morphology [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-26-00069" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], it is not known whether the phytochemical variants align with the taxonomic varieties. The majority of the studies focused on the chemical and genetic variability in plants from the Amazon State [

 <xref rid="B12-molecules-26-00069" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. As a further complication, rosewood is frequently misidentified as other species, such as 
 <italic>Aniba parviflora</italic> (Meisn.) Mez, which are similar morphologically, but are not economically important as sources of essential oils [
