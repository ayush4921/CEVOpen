<p>After six months of treatment, significant differences in increment of tree height, DBH, and tree crown diameter were observed between chemical treatments (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). Compared to control, the increment in height, DBH, and crown diameter of the CH
 <sub>3</sub>COOH treated trees was significantly decreased by 25.53, 34.92, and 32.78%, respectively (

 <sub>2</sub>, and control treatments. These results indicated that the CH
 <sub>3</sub>COOH treatment markedly inhibited tree growth, while the drill hole control, NaCl, and H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> treatments had little effect or no effect on tree growth.
