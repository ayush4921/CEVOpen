<p>One month after injection, significant changes occurred in the starch, soluble sugars, and lipids in various positions of the xylem. For all treatments, NSCs gradually decreased while lipids increased from position I to position III (

 </xref>). There were no significant differences in starch, soluble sugars, and lipids in position I between various treatments (

 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> treatment being the lowest. The lipid content showed the opposite trend. Contents of starch, soluble sugars, and lipids in position III were all significantly different among the treatments, and their patterns were similar to those of position II. In addition, there were lower concentrations of stachyose, galactose, arabinose, and sucrose than other NSCs in position III, especially for the H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> treatment. Correspondingly, the lipid content in position III was higher in the H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> than in other treatments.
