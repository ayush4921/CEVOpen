<p>After six months of treatment, significant changes were observed in each treatment (

 <sub>2</sub> treatment being the lowest, while arabinose, galactose, and fat were not significantly different. Except for sucrose and stachyose, the other carbohydrates in position II almost continued the patterns of the position I, and the lipid content was also significantly different between treatments. Furthermore, compared to one month after treatment, fructose, glucose, sucrose, stachyose, and starch were depleted in position III in all treatments, whereas the arabinose and galactose contents significantly increased (

 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> treatment induced the xylem to consume more NSCs and synthesize more lipids than the other treatments.
