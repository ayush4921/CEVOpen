<p>In this study, all treatments caused sapwood discoloration (

  <bold>Figure 5</bold>
 </xref>). The length and area of induced discoloration were significantly different among treatments, and the change in discoloration length was similar to that of the discoloration area (

  <bold>Figure 6</bold>
 </xref>). The largest discoloration length and area of both transverse and axial discoloration occurred in the CH
 <sub>3</sub>COOH treatment, followed by the H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> treatment. No significant changes in the transverse discoloration length and area were found with chemical treatments over time. In contrast, the transverse discoloration of the control treatment nearly doubled after three months, and the subsequent increase was small (
