<p>The length and area of axial discoloration of all treatments increased significantly with the treatment time (

  <bold>Figures 6Câ€“F</bold>
 </xref>). In the CH
 <sub>3</sub>COOH treatment, the discoloration length and area after three months were more than double those at one month. The discoloration length and area of the NaCl, H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, and CK plants increased significantly after three and six months. Hence, NaCl, and H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> had a lengthier period of induction effect compared with CH
 <sub>3</sub>COOH.
