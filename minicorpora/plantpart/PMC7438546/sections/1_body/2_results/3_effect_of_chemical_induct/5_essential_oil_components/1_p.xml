<p>Twenty-one essential oil components in the natural heartwood were used as a reference set for comparison with the essential oil components of the natural heartwood. The composition and relative content of essential oil components induced by chemicals increased with the treatment time (

  <bold>Table 1</bold>
 </xref>). One month after treatment, only 6–8 components of essential oil were detected, and the total relative amount of essential oil components was 38.90–44.65%. After three months, 9–12 components of essential oil were detected, and the total relative amount of essential oil components was 41.27–48.47%. After six months, there were 12 and 14 kinds of essential oil in the CH
 <sub>3</sub>COOH and NaCl treatments, respectively, and the total relative amount of essential oil components of the NaCl treatment was up to 50.07%. The control treatment, which contained more essential oil components (17), had the total relative amount of the essential oil components at 46.47%.
