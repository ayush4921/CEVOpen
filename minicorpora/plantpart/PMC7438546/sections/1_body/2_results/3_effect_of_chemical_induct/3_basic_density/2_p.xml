<p>After one and three months of treatment, the basic density of the discolored sapwood in each treatment was not significant different from that of NH. However, the density of the discolored sapwood in the H

 <sub>2</sub> and control treatments was significantly higher than that of NH after six months, while the density of the discolored sapwood in CH
 <sub>3</sub>COOH and NaCl treated wood remained slightly lower than that of NH (
