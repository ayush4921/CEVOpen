<p>This study showed that the injection of an acid solution into the trunk markedly inhibited growth of the tree, while the injection of distilled water, NaCl solution, and H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> solution into the trunk had little or no effect. 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Wang (2016)</xref> found that acid solution destroyed the tissue cells of the xylem, and thus, it inhibited the growth and even caused tree death. The comprehensive analysis of the transverse and axial discoloration ranges indicated that the range of discoloration induced by CH
 <sub>3</sub>COOH was the largest, followed by the H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> treatment. In terms of the persistence of the induction effect, some differences were found between the transverse and axial directions. The effects of transverse discoloration induced by all treatments were only maintained for one month; however, in the axial direction, the induction effect of the CH
 <sub>3</sub>COOH treatment lasted for three months, and the H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and NaCl treatments still had induction effects after six months. Moreover, the H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> treatment induced xylem to consume most of the NSCs and synthesize most of the lipids, and its essential oil content and basic density reached the levels of natural heartwood. By contrast, although the density of the discolored sapwood induced by the CH
 <sub>3</sub>COOH and NaCl treatments reached the level of natural heartwood, their essential oil contents were still much lower than those of natural heartwood. In addition, the essential oil components of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-induced discolored sapwood were closest to those of natural heartwood. Therefore, H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-induced 
 <italic>Jiang Xiang</italic> is closest to natural heartwood, while the CH
 <sub>3</sub>COOH and NaCl treatments have poor induction effects. Moreover, the relative amount of trans-Nerolidol (39.14%), (E)-beta-Farnesene (0.04%), and alpha-Bisabolol (0.12%) in the H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-induced essential oil met the standards for high-quality 
 <italic>Jiang Xiang</italic> which are 25–60%, 0–3%, and 0.1–6.0%, respectively. Thus, H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> is a promising inducer for 
 <italic>Jiang Xiang</italic> production in 
 <italic>D. odorifera</italic>. The superior effect of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> treatment may be related to its involvement in the wound signal of 
 <italic>D. odorifera</italic> (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Cui et al., 2019</xref>), which in turn illustrates the important role of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> in wound-induced 
 <italic>Jiang Xiang</italic> formation. This study addressed some of the key factors related to heartwood formation and the results indicate the potential of for H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> to induce high-quality 
 <italic>Jiang Xiang</italic> production. Further study is warranted to explore the molecular mechanism of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> regulation on 
 <italic>Jiang Xiang</italic> formation in 
 <italic>D. odorifera</italic>. Furthermore, the chemicals used in this study are only in certain doses, and a wider range of concentrations needs to be examined. At present, the production of 
 <italic>Jiang Xiang</italic> is extremely limited. The induction of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> will greatly increase the yield and will have commercial potential if the techniques can be further improved and widely implemented.
