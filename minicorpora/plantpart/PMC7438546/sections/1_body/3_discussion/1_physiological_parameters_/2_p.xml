<p>In terms of wood properties, the relative moisture content of the discolored sapwood continued to decrease, while the density and oil content increased gradually during the induction process. Dehydration of sapwood was an important stage in the formation of heartwood (

 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Déjardin et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, the deposition increased the xylem density and oil content. These results are consistent with the density and oil content of heartwood being greater than that of sapwood (

 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Searle and Owen, 2005</xref>). In addition, GC–MS analysis also showed that the essential oil components of the discolored sapwood became progressively more similar to those of natural heartwood.
