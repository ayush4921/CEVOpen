0: The formation of heartwood is often accompanied by physiological processes such as xylem dehydration ( Nakada, 2006;  Kuroda et al., 2009), programmed cell death ( Spicer, 2005;  Nakaba et al., 2008;  Nakaba et al., 2012), depletion of storage compounds ( Magel et al., 1994;  Piispanen and Saranpaa, 2001;  Nakaba et al., 2013), deposition of heartwood substances ( Magel et al., 1991;  Nakada and Fukatsu, 2012), and changes in cell wall structure ( Nakada and Fukatsu, 2012;  Song et al., 2014).
1: The deposition of heartwood substances is the most important manifestation of heartwood formation due to its importance in natural durability; it is also important as heartwood extractives may be important pharmaceuticals.
2: Heartwood substances are the products of secondary metabolism of trees, whose metabolized substrates are mainly non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs).
3: NSCs in trees are the main photosynthetic storage compounds and transported inwards through ray parenchyma cells in the formation of secondary components in heartwood ( Hillis, 1987).
4: NSCs mainly include starch and soluble sugars ( e.g.
5: sucrose, fructose, glucose, arabinose, galactose, stachyose).
6: The arabinose and galactose contents were reported to be related to the synthesis and hydrolysis of hemicellulose in the cell wall during the formation of heartwood ( Saranpaa and Holl, 1989;  Fischer and Holl, 1992).
7: In addition, the content of lipid in xylem has also proved to be involved in heartwood formation ( Bergstrom, 2003).
