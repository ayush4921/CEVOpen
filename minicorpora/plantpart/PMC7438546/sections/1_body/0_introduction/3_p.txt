0: Mechanical wounding has been reported to induce the production of  Jiang Xiang in  D. odorifera ( Meng et al., 2010).
1: Moreover, hydrogen peroxide (H 2O 2) could be an important wound signal in  D. odorifera that may help induce vessel occlusions and production of  Jiang Xiang ( Cui et al., 2019).
2: Experiments are required to determine the potential of chemicals such as hydrogen peroxide (H 2O 2), acetic acid (CH 3COOH), and sodium chloride (NaCl) solutions.
