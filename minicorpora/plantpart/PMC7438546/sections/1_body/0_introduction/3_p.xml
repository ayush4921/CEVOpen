<p>Mechanical wounding has been reported to induce the production of 
 <italic>Jiang Xiang</italic> in 
 <italic>D. odorifera</italic> (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Meng et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, hydrogen peroxide (H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>) could be an important wound signal in 
 <italic>D. odorife</italic>ra that may help induce vessel occlusions and production of 
 <italic>Jiang Xiang</italic> (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Cui et al., 2019</xref>). Experiments are required to determine the potential of chemicals such as hydrogen peroxide (H
