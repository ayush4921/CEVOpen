<p>In order to better understand heartwood formation induced by chemicals, this study was conducted to investigate: 1) whether H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, CH
 <sub>3</sub>COOH, and NaCl could induce the heartwood formation in 
 <italic>D. odorifera</italic>; and 2) the physiological changes in xylem during chemical-induced
