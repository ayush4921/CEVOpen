0: Chemical injection appears to be the most promising technique for stimulating heartwood formation of trees as certain substances may act rapidly and are easy to apply in precise amounts.
1: Potential heartwood induction chemicals include weak acids, inorganic salts and various plant growth regulators (ethrel, methyl jasmonate, salicylic acid), which have been applied to stimulate the production of agarwood, the heartwood of  Aquilaria sinensis (Lour.)
2: Gilg.
3: ( Liu et al., 2013;  Van Thanh et al., 2015;  Wang, 2016).
4: In addition, chemical induction has also been used in  Acacia auriculiformis A. Cunn.
5: ex Benth.
6: ( Baqui et al., 1984),  Samanea saman (Jacq.)
7: Merr.
8: ( Patel and Bhat, 1984),  Quercus serrata Thunb.
9: ( Moungsrimuangdee et al., 2011),  Santalum album L. ( Radomiljac, 1998;  Liu, 2012),  D. odorifera ( Zhou et al., 2014;  Wang et al., 2017), and some conifers ( Stubbs et al., 1984;  Martin et al., 2002).
10: However, the chemical inducers in these studies are mostly plant growth regulators.
11: It is still unclear whether weak acids and inorganic salts might induce the formation of  Jiang Xiang in  D. odorifera.
