0: Dalbergia odorifera T. Chen (Leguminosae) is a medium-sized tree native to Hainan Island, southern China ( Wariss et al., 2017) and has been widely cultivated in the tropical regions of Central and South America, Africa, and East and Southern Asia, especially in China ( Ninh The, 2017).
1: The heartwood of  D. odorifera is not only one of the best rosewoods in the world, but is also a valuable traditional Chinese medicine known as  Jiang Xiang ( Yu et al., 2017;  Liu et al., 2019).
2: Jiang Xiang has been recognized by the Chinese Pharmacopeia for centuries to dissipate blood stasis, regulating  Qi, stop bleeding, and relieve pain ( Cheng et al., 1998;  Wang et al., 2000;  Sugiyama et al., 2002;  Choi et al., 2009;  Cui et al., 2017).
3: Authoritative industry standards stipulate that high-quality  Jiang Xiang has the relative amount of trans-Nerolidol 2560%, (E)-beta-Farnesene 03%, and alpha-Bisabolol 0.16.0% in the essential oil ( Li et al., 2016).
4: The annual demand for raw  D. odorifera heartwood is over 300 tonnes, and the annual production value exceeds 700 million USD.
5: However, the heartwood of  D. odorifera is formed very slowly once trees have reached about 6 years of age ( Ma et al., 2017).
6: Thus, there is a need to better understand and promote formation of  D. odorifera heartwood ( Cui et al., 2017).
