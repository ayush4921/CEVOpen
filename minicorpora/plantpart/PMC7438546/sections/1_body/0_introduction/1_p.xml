 <italic>Dalbergia odorifera</italic> T. Chen (Leguminosae) is a medium-sized tree native to Hainan Island, southern China (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Wariss et al., 2017</xref>) and has been widely cultivated in the tropical regions of Central and South America, Africa, and East and Southern Asia, especially in China (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Ninh The, 2017</xref>). The heartwood of 
 <italic>D. odorifera</italic> is not only one of the best rosewoods in the world, but is also a valuable traditional Chinese medicine known as 
 <italic>Jiang Xiang</italic> (

 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). 
 <italic>Jiang Xiang</italic> has been recognized by the Chinese Pharmacopeia for centuries to dissipate blood stasis, regulating 
 <italic>Qi</italic>, stop bleeding, and relieve pain (

 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Cui et al., 2017</xref>). Authoritative industry standards stipulate that high-quality 
 <italic>Jiang Xiang</italic> has the relative amount of trans-Nerolidol 25–60%, (E)-beta-Farnesene 0–3%, and alpha-Bisabolol 0.1–6.0% in the essential oil (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2016</xref>). The annual demand for raw 
 <italic>D. odorifera</italic> heartwood is over 300 tonnes, and the annual production value exceeds 700 million USD. However, the heartwood of 
 <italic>D. odorifera</italic> is formed very slowly once trees have reached about 6 years of age (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, there is a need to better understand and promote formation of 
 <italic>D. odorifera</italic> heartwood (
