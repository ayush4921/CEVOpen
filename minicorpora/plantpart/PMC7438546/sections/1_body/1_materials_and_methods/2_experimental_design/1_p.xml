<p>Three chemicals used were: 0.1 mol L
 <sup>−1</sup> hydrogen peroxide (H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>), 1.0 mol L
 <sup>−1</sup> (pH≈2.4) acetic acid (CH
 <sub>3</sub>COOH) and 1.0 mol L
 <sup>−1</sup> sodium chloride (NaCl). Distilled water was injected as a control. Sixty trees of similar size, all without heartwood were selected for a single-tree plot experiment with 15 replicates for each treatment. A tiny drill was used to detect which trees have or don’t have heartwood. In May 2017, an injection hole of 1 cm diameter and 5 cm deep was drilled at a downward angle of 45° at 1.3 m from the ground on each tree. An amount of 50 ml solution was injected into each tree over 8 h period with a 5 ml syringe, and the hole was sealed with a cork after injection.
