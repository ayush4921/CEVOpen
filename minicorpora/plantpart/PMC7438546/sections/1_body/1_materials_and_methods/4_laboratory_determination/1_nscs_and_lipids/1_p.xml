<p>Arabinose and galactose contents were determined on an Agilent 1200 liquid chromatograph with the following parameters: SHISEIDO C18 column (4.6 × 250.0 mm, 5 μm); mobile phase: 0.1 mol L
 <sup>−1</sup> pH 7.0 phosphate buffer solution, acetonitrile:water = 82:18 (v:v); flow rate 1.0 ml min
 <sup>−1</sup>; column temperature 25°C; injection volume 10 μl; wavelength 245 nm (after degraded by 4 mol L
 <sup>−1</sup> trifluoroacetic acid and derivatives with 1-phenyl-3-methyl-5-pyrazolone). Glucose, fructose, sucrose, and stachyose were determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with the following parameters: Shodex NH2P column (250.0 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm); mobile phase: acetonitrile:water = 75:25 (v:v); flow rate 1.0 ml min
 <sup>−1</sup>; injection volume 10 μl; column temperature 35°C; detector: differential refractive index (DRI), temperature: 35°C. The starch content was determined by an anthrone colorimetric method (
