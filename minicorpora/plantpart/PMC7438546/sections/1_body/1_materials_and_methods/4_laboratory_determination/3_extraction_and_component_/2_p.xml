<p>GC–MS analysis was performed by Agilent coupled with a 6890N-5975I system equipped with flame ionization detector (FID) and a DB-5MS (30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm film thickness). The temperature program included a starting temperature of 70°C which was then increased to 250°C at the rate of 8°C min
 <sup>−1</sup>, and this temperature held for 15 min. Detailed operating parameters are described by 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Cui et al. (2019)</xref>. Qualitative identification of essential oil components was based on comparison of their retention times and mass spectra with the data in the Wiley and NIST electronic libraries as well as the authentic reference compounds that were reported in the published literature (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2000</xref>). The relative amount of each component was calculated by comparing its average peak area to the total areas.
