<p>All chemical inducers in this study are effective in inducing discoloration of sapwood. In this process, physiological parameters of discolored sapwood gradually evolved to resemble those of natural heartwood. Comparative analysis indicated hydrogen peroxide (H

 <italic>Jiang Xiang</italic> was closest to natural heartwood and met the standards for high-quality 
 <italic>Jiang Xiang</italic>, while the induction effects of CH
 <sub>3</sub>COOH and NaCl were unsatisfactory. Thus, this study supports the hypothesis that H

 <sub>2</sub> has the potential to induce formation of
