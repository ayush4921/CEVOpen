<p id="Par39">The main component of the two essential oils obtained from leaves and flowers of 
 <italic>S. hydrangea</italic> were spathulenol, 1,8-cineole, trans-caryophyllene, β-pinene, β-eudesmol, camphor, α-pinene and caryophyllene oxide. Both oils had significant inhibitory and lethal effects on the Gram-negative bacterium 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, that is not common among different 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> species. In addition, both were able to inhibit 
 <italic>Shigella dysenteriae</italic> and 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, which are responsible for diarrhea and pneumonia in humans. Overall, the results underline the potential application of these oils for future development of new therapeutic systems and drug adjuvants, while additional tests should be performed to evaluate their effectiveness as food preservatives. This is a very interesting prospect, which has gained large interest in the last two decades due to awareness concerning the toxicity, ineffectiveness, antibiotic resistance and adverse effects provided by the widespread use of synthetic drugs and food preservatives.
