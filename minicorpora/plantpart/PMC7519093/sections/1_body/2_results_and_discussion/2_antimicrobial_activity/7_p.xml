<p id="Par32">The MIC value of 
 <italic>S. hydrangea</italic> essential oils was the same against the Gram-negative bacteria 
 <italic>Shigella dysenteriae</italic> (62.5 µg/mL), 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (15.63 µg/mL) and 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> (62.5 µg/mL), probably because of the similar composition of the two oils. However, the differences detected in the composition of the oils may be responsible for the greater inhibitory effect of the essential oil obtained from flowers against Gram-positive bacteria like 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and Gram-negative bacteria such as 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Proteus vulgaris</italic> and 
 <italic>Salmonella paratyphi-A</italic>. On the contrary, efficacy against 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> was higher when the oil from leaves was used (MIC 250 µg/mL versus 1000 µg/mL provided by flower oil), especially when compared to the commercial antifungal nystatin (125 µg/mL).
