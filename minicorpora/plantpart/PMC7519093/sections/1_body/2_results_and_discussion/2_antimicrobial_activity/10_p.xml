<p id="Par35">Other studies have shown that Gram-negative bacteria are more resistant to plant-derived essential oils in comparison with Gram-positive bacteria, probably because of the different composition of the lipopolysaccharide membrane. Indeed, the cell wall structure of Gram-negative bacteria is more complex than that of Gram-positive bacteria

 </sup>. Due to the similar composition of oils from leaves and flowers, as reported above, the antibacterial activity can be attributed to the monoterpenes α- and β-pinene. However, since the amount of these two compounds was lower in the oil from flowers (Table
