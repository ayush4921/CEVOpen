<p id="Par25">Caryophyllene-II was detected for the first time in this study in the essential oil obtained from the flowers. A small amount of camphor was detected. Differently, it was the second main bioactive detected in the essential oil obtained by Ebrahimi et al.

 </sup>; in particular, the amount was higher (12.06%) when the plant was cultivated at 1100 m above sea level and lower (5.71%) when cultivated at 2000 m above sea level. These differences confirm the key role of the environment (soil chemical composition and physiographic factors such as altitude) on the genetic and non-genetic variations of plants along with the production of secondary metabolites
