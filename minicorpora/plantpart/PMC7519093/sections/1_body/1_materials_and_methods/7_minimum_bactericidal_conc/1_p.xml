<p id="Par15">To determine the minimum concentration able to kill the bacteria, the same microdilution method described above was used. After 24 h of incubation with both bacteria and oils at different concentrations, 5 µL of the content of each well was inoculated with nutrient agar medium and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h for bacterial strains. After incubation, the colony-forming units were enumerated. The MBC was the lowest concentration able to effectively reduce the growth of microorganisms (99.5%).</p>
