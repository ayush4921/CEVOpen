<p>The prevalence of bovine mastitis resulted in the extensive use of antibiotics, intramammary and parenterally [

 <xref rid="B10-antibiotics-10-00205" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] revealed that 90% of antibiotic residues in milk are a consequence of mastitis therapy. Hence, the use of antibiotics in the treatment of mastitis has some negative consequences, such as entry of antibiotic residues into the human food chain [

 <xref rid="B12-antibiotics-10-00205" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Additionally, as a negative consequence, increasing resistance of microorganisms to antibiotics causes the degree of intramammary infections cure to be at a very low level. Moreover, the degree of cure in the case of
