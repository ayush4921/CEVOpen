0: The prevalence of bovine mastitis resulted in the extensive use of antibiotics, intramammary and parenterally [ 9].
1: Erskine, et al.
2: [ 10] revealed that 90% of antibiotic residues in milk are a consequence of mastitis therapy.
3: Hence, the use of antibiotics in the treatment of mastitis has some negative consequences, such as entry of antibiotic residues into the human food chain [ 11], with the possibility of antibiotic-resistant bacteria strains transmission [ 12].
4: Additionally, as a negative consequence, increasing resistance of microorganisms to antibiotics causes the degree of intramammary infections cure to be at a very low level.
5: Moreover, the degree of cure in the case of  Staphylococcus aureus is 20 to 75% [ 13].
