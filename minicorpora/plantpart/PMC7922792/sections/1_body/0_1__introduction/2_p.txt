0: The most common problems influencing animals health in both production methods are those related to the health status of the mammary gland [ 5].
1: Actually, the occurrence of mastitis is highly frequent and, according to the type of clinical manifestation, this disease has clinical and subclinical classifications that occur simultaneously [ 6, 7].
2: The etiology of mastitis is complex, and both mechanical and chemical factors that can be attributed to omissions in the way of housing and the procedure of milking cows certainly could contribute to the development of this disease [ 8].
3: This problem is more represented on large farms where little human labor is employed.
4: Besides the etiology of mastitis, microbiological factors are more important, dominant bacterial causes [ 5].
5: While intramammary administration implies application of antibiotics directly in mammary gland through teat channel in order to achieve their effect locally in the gland, parenteral administration is application where the digestive tract is bypassed (e.g., intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intravenously) in order to achieve systemic effect including mammary gland tissue.
