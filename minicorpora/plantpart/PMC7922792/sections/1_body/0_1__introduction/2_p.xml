<p>The most common problems influencing animalsâ€™ health in both production methods are those related to the health status of the mammary gland [

 <xref rid="B7-antibiotics-10-00205" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The etiology of mastitis is complex, and both mechanical and chemical factors that can be attributed to omissions in the way of housing and the procedure of milking cows certainly could contribute to the development of this disease [

While intramammary administration implies application of antibiotics directly in mammary gland through teat channel in order to achieve their effect locally in the gland, parenteral administration is application where the digestive tract is bypassed (e.g., intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intravenously) in order to achieve systemic effect including mammary gland tissue.
