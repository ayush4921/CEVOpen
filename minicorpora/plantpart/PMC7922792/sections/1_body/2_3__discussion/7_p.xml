<p>The results obtained in this study indicated that the common thyme EO showed stronger antibacterial potential against 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic> spp. (β-hemolytic), 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic> spp. 
 <italic>Enterobacter sakazakii</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, and 
 <italic>Klebsiella oxytoca</italic> in comparison with the wild thyme EO. On the other hand, wild thyme EO samples grouped in the positive part of PCA1 (as a result of higher amounts of thymol and γ-terpinen), and thus showed stronger antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> spp. (coagulase-negative) and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> spp. (

 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> EO against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> spp. isolated from bovine mastitis has been previously confirmed [
