<p>Compared with carvacrol, thymol also possesses similar antibacterial activity, even though its hydroxyl group is located in a different position [
 <xref rid="B58-antibiotics-10-00205" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The thymol primary mode of antibacterial action is partly understood and it is probably similar to carvacrol. This mode of action results in structural and functional alterations in the cytoplasmic membrane that can damage the outer and inner membranes and interact with membrane proteins, as well as intracellular targets [
 <xref rid="B59-antibiotics-10-00205" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. In contact with the cell membrane, thymol can modify membrane permeability, leading to the release of K
 <sup>+</sup> ions and ATP [

In contrast to the efficiency of monoterpenes with added oxygen molecules (carvacrol and thymol), monoterpene hydrocarbons p-cymene and Î³-terpinene used separately do not demonstrate remarkable inhibitory effects against bacteria growth [
