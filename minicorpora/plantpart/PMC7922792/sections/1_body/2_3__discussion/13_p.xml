<p>Interestingly, although studies conducted so far highlighted the possibilities of EOs as a potential resistance-modifying agent, they provided limited evidence suggesting the spontaneous occurrence of resistance to EOs [

In fact, resistance of bacteria to EOs and their active components depends on their chemical composition, as well as their mechanism of action, which is specific and completely different compared with antibiotics. The antimicrobial activity of these natural substances has not been fully studied, but, owing to the proven ability of some EOs to inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis, block transcription, Î²-lactamase production, biofilm formation, or efflux pump operation, they are considered to be useful in the treatment of infections caused by resistant microorganisms [

 <xref rid="B69-antibiotics-10-00205" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Besides, the difference between the mechanisms of resistance in EOs and antimicrobials is giving immense potential for the replacement of conventional antimicrobial therapy with phytotherapy.
