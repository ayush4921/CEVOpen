<p>It is well known that plants possess significant antioxidant potential, mainly attributed to the presence of different aromatic, phenolic, and flavonoid compounds [

Although EOs in all of the tested systems exhibited weaker free radical scavenging effects, it must be emphasized that the comparison of the antioxidant potential in the present study was performed between pure compounds and EOs, which are mixtures of different secondary metabolites, meaning that some of them do not possess potential for scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and preventing biological membrane degradation. Regarding their toxicity, synthetic antioxidants are abused in some food and cosmetic products, especially
