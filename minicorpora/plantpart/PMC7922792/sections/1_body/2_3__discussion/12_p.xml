<p>This study revealed significant resistance of the most common mastitis pathogens to antimicrobials, indicating the importance of finding an alternative to antibiotic treatment in therapy of this disease. Moreover, it was shown that gram-negative pathogens (
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Klebsiella oxytoca</italic> and 
 <italic>Enterobacter sakazakii</italic>) are resistant to erythromycin, amoxycillin, and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. This is in accordance with results of other studies, which determined resistance to the mentioned antimicrobials [

 <italic>Streptococcus</italic> spp. isolated in this study showed resistance to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, neomycin, enrofloxacin, tetracycline, lincomycin, and ceftriaxone, which is in line with the resistance determined in other studies [
