<p>Phenolic compounds (carvacrol and thymol) account for 54.98% of the total oil in 
 <italic>T. serpyllum</italic> EO and 49.08% in 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> EO. The antibacterial effect of the EOs tested in our study probably depends on these compounds, and a number of studies revealed that phenolic compounds, such as carvacrol and thymol, possess antibacterial activity [
