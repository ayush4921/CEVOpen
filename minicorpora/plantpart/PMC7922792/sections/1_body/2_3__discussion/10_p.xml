<p>However, several studies indicated that 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene can enhance the inhibitory effects of carvacrol when these two compounds are used together [

 <italic>p</italic>-cymene, owing to its hydrophobic nature, greatly contributes to the cytoplasmic membrane swelling [

 <xref rid="B61-antibiotics-10-00205" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] indicated that 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene enabled carvacrol to be more easily transported into the cell. With respect to these findings, a slightly higher antibacterial effect of 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> EO obtained in this research could be accounted for by a slightly higher content of 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene.
