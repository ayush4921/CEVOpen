<p>Application of principal components analysis (PCA) on the results describing the MIC and MBC of the tested EOs in relation to the most abundant secondary metabolites showed that the first two principal components (PCs) describe more than 95% of the dataset variability, while the principal components axis 1 (PCA1) describes more than 90% of the samples’ variability. It can be observed that most of the variability is explained by the results describing the antibacterial potential in the case of 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic> spp., 
 <italic>Enterobacter sakazakii</italic>, 
 <italic>Klebsiella oxytoca</italic>, and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> spp., as well as by the chemical composition in terms of carvacrol, trans-β-caryophyllene, and γ-terpinene content. Positioning of 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> EO samples in the negative part of PCA1 suggests that these samples, in relation to 
 <italic>Thymus serpyllum</italic> EO, are characterized by the presence of significant amounts of carvacrol, trans-β-caryophyllene, and p-cymene. Furthermore, the thyme EO showed stronger antibacterial potential against 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic> spp. (β-hemolytic), 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic> spp. 
 <italic>Enterobacter sakazakii</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, and 
 <italic>Klebsiella oxytoca</italic> in comparison with the wild thyme EO. On the other hand, 
 <italic>Thymus serpyllum</italic> EO samples grouped in the positive part of PCA1 (as a result of higher amounts of thymol and γ-terpinen), and thus showed stronger antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> spp. (coagulase-negative) and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> spp. (
