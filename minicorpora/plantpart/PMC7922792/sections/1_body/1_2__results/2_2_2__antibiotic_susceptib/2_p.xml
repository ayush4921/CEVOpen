<p>Application of correspondence analysis (CA) on a dataset describing bactericidal potential of different antibiotics on bacteria isolated from the milk samples shows associations of different bacteria and the evaluated antibiotics in terms of bacteria resistance (R) or sensitivity (S). It must be stated that the results obtained for penicillin (PEN) and cloxacillin (CLO) were not included in statistical processing because of their uniformity. It was observed that the first three correspondent axes (CA1, CA2, and CA3) describe around 50% of the samples’ variability (percentage of inertia for CA1, CA2, and CA3 was 22.14%, 17.83%, and 9.31%, respectively). The position of the evaluated bacteria cultures and antibiotics in the space defined by the first three correspondent axes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-10-00205-f002">Figure 2</xref>) shows close association of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (E_c), 
 <italic>Klebsiella oxytoca</italic> (K_o) and 
 <italic>Enterobacter sakazakii</italic> (E_s) in the negative part of CA1 and the positive part of CA2 as a result of resistance to erythromycin (ERY), amoxycillin (AMX), and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (AMC), and sensitivity to neomycin (NEO) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (SXT). Furthermore, 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic> spp. (Strep) are localized in the negative part of CA1 and the negative part of CA2, which is closely related to resistance to SXT, NEO, enrofloxacin (ENR), tetracycline (TET), lincomycin (LIN), and ceftriaxone (CRO). 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic> spp. β-heamoliticus (Strep_bh) are sensitive to AMC, CRO, and ENR. 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> are resistant to ampicillin (AMP), penicillin (PEN), and cloxacillin (CLO).
