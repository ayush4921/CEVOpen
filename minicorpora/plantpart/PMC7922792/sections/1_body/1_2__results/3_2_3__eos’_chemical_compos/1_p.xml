<p>Detailed chemical compositions of the tested wild (
 <italic>T. serpyllum</italic>) and common thyme (
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic>) EOs are listed in 
 <xref rid="antibiotics-10-00205-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. In the wild thyme EO, there are 19 identified compounds (accounting for 99.29% of total volatile compounds) and, in the common thyme EO, there are 25 compounds (accounting for 99.20% of total volatile compounds). In general, the compounds in both EOs are classified as monoterpenes, with predominance of aromatic oxygenated monoterpenes (51.49% in 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> and 54.98% in 
 <italic>T. serpyllum</italic>). The dominant compounds in 
 <italic>T. serpyllum</italic> EO are thymol (54.17%), γ-terpinene (22.18%), and 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (16.66%). In 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> EO, the dominant compounds are thymol (45.22%) and 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (23.83%), while the content of γ-terpinene is notably lower (3.12%). 
 <italic>Trans</italic>-β-caryophyllene, a sesquiterpene hydrocarbon, is the third main compound (4.04%) in 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> EO.
