<p>DPPH assay was employed to determine the ability of the tested EOs of common and wild thyme, as well as propyl gallate (PG), to act as donors of hydrogen atoms or electrons in the transformation of DPPH
 <sup>•</sup> into its reduced form DPPH-H reaction [
 <xref rid="B32-antibiotics-10-00205" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Although PG (propyl gallate) (0.71 µg/mL) exhibited very potent free radical scavenging capacity, both EOs were able to reduce the DPPH
 <sup>•</sup> into DPPH-H, reaching 50% of reduction (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 16 for 
 <italic>T. serpyllum</italic> and 14 µL/mL for 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic>). The free radical scavenging capacity (RSC) of EOs for hydroxyl (OH) radicals was evaluated by measuring the degradation of 2-deoxyribose with OH radicals, generated in the Fenton reaction [
 <xref rid="B32-antibiotics-10-00205" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Both EOs showed a lower RSC (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 170 for 
 <italic>T. serpyllum</italic> and 230 µg/mL for 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic>, respectively) compared with the PG (propyl gallate) (9.07 µg/mL) and 
 <italic>tert-</italic>butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) (0.03 µg/mL) IC
 <sub>50</sub> values, used as standard synthetic antioxidants. However, both of them exhibited protective effects on 2-deoxy-
 <sc>d</sc>-ribose degradation, although they were lower compared with ascorbic acid (AA) (2.03 µg/mL). Regarding the neutralization of NO, neither EO reached 50% of reduction. The testing of the ability of the examined EOs to protect the integrity of biological membranes containing lipids was evaluated through determination of lipid peroxidation (LP) inhibition potential, pointing to protective effects of the tested EOs (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 170 for 
 <italic>T. serpyllum</italic> and 190 µg/mL for 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic>), but notably lower from those exhibited by BHT (7.29 µg/mL).
