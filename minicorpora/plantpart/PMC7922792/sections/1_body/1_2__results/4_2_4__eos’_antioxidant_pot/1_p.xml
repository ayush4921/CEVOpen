<p>The antioxidant potential of the tested EOs (
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> and 
 <italic>T. serpyllum</italic>) and the positive control substances were evaluated in a series of in vitro tests (
 <xref rid="antibiotics-10-00205-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). All results, except those obtained in the ferric reduction antioxidant potential (FRAP) test, are presented as the inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) values, representing the concentrations of the EOs and positive controls that caused 50% of neutralization, determined by linear regression analysis.
