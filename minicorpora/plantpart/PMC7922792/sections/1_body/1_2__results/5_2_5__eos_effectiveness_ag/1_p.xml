<p>EOs effectiveness against mastitis-associated bacteria was expressed as minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) (
 <xref rid="antibiotics-10-00205-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Among the fourteen mastitis-associated bacteria, strain IX 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic> spp. (β-hemolytic) showed the most sensitivity to the tested EOs (MIC/MBC were 0.78/1.56 and 0.39/0.78 mg/mL for 
 <italic>T. serpyllum</italic> and 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic>, respectively). Regarding 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic> spp. β heamoliticus, MICs for 
 <italic>T. serpyllum</italic> ranged from 0.78 to 1.56 mg/mL, while for the same oil, MBCs ranged from 1.56 to 12.5 mg/mL. In the case of 
 <italic>T. vulgaris,</italic> MICs ranged from 0.39 to 3.125 mg/ mL, while MBCs ranged from 3.125 to 6.25 mg/mL. TV is more active against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>E. sakazakii,</italic> and 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic> spp., while it is less effective against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> spp. than TS.
