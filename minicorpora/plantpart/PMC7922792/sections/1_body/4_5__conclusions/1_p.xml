<p>This study highlighted that two thyme (
 <italic>Thymus serpyllum</italic> and 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic>) EOs can be used in the development of pharmaceutical formulation as an alternative to conventional mastitis therapy, owing to the EOsâ€™ chemical composition, antioxidant potential, and effectiveness against mastitis-associated bacteria. Further research on dairy farms is needed to conduct clinical trials of EO-based formulation. Moreover, additional studies should explore their toxicity to mammalian cells and drug-like properties (pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic) to determine their potential as therapeutic agents. Finally, further studies also need to compare the economic aspects of the conventional versus herbal treatment of mastitis, as well as the combination of EOs with common antibiotics used in the treatment of mastitis.
