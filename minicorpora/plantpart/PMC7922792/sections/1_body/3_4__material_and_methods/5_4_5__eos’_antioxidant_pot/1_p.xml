<p>The antioxidant potential of the commercial EOs of wild (
 <italic>Thymus serpyllum</italic>) and common thyme (
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic>) was evaluated in five in vitro assays, as single models are not recommended for evaluation because of the complex composition of different plant extracts [
 <xref rid="B74-antibiotics-10-00205" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. The potential of the EOs to neutralize 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), hydroxyl (OH) and nitroso (NO) radicals was assessed by previously described spectrophotometric methods [
 <xref rid="B32-antibiotics-10-00205" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Moreover, the ability of the examined EOs to inhibit the processes of lipid peroxidation (LP) is evaluated, using liposomes emulsion as a test model [
 <xref rid="B20-antibiotics-10-00205" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The potential of the examined EOs to reduce Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> (ferric reduction antioxidant potentialâ€”FRAP test) was assessed by the method described by Lesjak et al. [
 <xref rid="B45-antibiotics-10-00205" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], as it is a model correlating with the neutralization of hypochlorite and peroxynitrite anion [
 <xref rid="B75-antibiotics-10-00205" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. The results obtained in the FRAP assay were expressed as ascorbic acid equivalents (AAEs) based on the previously constructed calibration curve for ascorbic acid. For each sample, four replicates were recorded in all test-systems. Synthetic antioxidants, including ascorbic acid (AA), propyl gallate (PG), and 
 <italic>tert-</italic>butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), were tested under the same experimental conditions as positive control for antioxidant potential of the tested EOs.
