<p>The qualitative and quantitative analysis of the EOs was carried out on HP-5MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm; film thickness 0.25 μm) on Agilent 6890B gas chromatograph coupled with flame ionization detector (GC-FID) instrument coupled to Agilent 5977 mass spectrometry detector (MSD) (Agilent Technologies Inc, Santa Clara, CA, USA, USA). The samples were injected in split mode 1:20, at an inlet temperature of 220 °C. The oven temperature was set at 60 °C and increased at a rate of 3 °C/min up to 246 °C. Helium was the carrier gas (1 mL/min), while the temperature of the MSD transfer line was set to 230 °C.</p>
