<p>Bacteriological testing was performed by taking aseptic milk samples from all animals (clinical and subclinical mastitis) during the morning milking. The samples were then taken in sterile tubes marked with an ID number of the cow and stored at 4 °C. Afterwards, the samples were processed at the Laboratory for Milk Hygiene at the Department of Veterinary Medicine, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Novi Sad. The samples were inoculated on 2% blood agar, using a platinum loop (0.01 mL), followed by incubation of the samples for 48 h at 37 °C. Biochemical and cultural characteristics of the grown microorganisms were taken into account during their determination. Isolation and identification of bacterial strain from milk samples was conducted using microbiological procedures for the diagnosis of udder infection published by National Mastitis Council. A loopful of milk sample was streaked on blood agar (Oxoid) and then subcultured on the following selective media: Mannitol Salt Agar, Edwards Agar, Salmonella-Shigella Agar, and MacConkey Agar. Then, plates were incubated aerobically at 37 °C for 24 h. After incubation, the plates were examined for colony morphology, pigmentation, and hemolytic characteristics at 24–48 h. Catalase test was applied for distinguishing between staphylococci and other Gram-positive cocci, mannitol fermentation test, coagulase test (either positive or negative), hemolytic pattern, and colony morphology. The isolates were confirmed by biochemical tests: oxidase activity, acid production (lactose sucrose and glucose fermentation), indole production, Voges–Proskauer, and hydrogen sulfide production. In addition, each strain was confirmed using Analytical Profile Index API-20 tests (API, bio Meraux, France). To isolate staphylococci, listed media were used: blood agar, nutrient agar, Ziehl–Neelsen, MSA, for 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> isolation nutrient agar, MacConkey agar, and API 25 were used. For streptococci, Edwards agar and esculin were used. Of the phenotypic characteristics for staphylococci, the occurrence of α and β hemolysis and, for E. coli, there were pink colonies with precipitation. For streptococci determination, hydrolysis of esculin was used.
