<p>EOs’ effectiveness on planktonically grown bacteria was determined according to the Clinical Laboratory Standards [
 <xref rid="B76-antibiotics-10-00205" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] with slight modifications. The bacterial suspensions were prepared using overnight cultures and adjusted to 0.5 Mc Farland standard turbidity (corresponding to 1 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/mL), using a densitometer DEN-1 (Biosan, Riga, Latvia). All tests were performed in Muller–Hinton broth (MHB) (Lab M, International Diagnostics Group Plc, Bury, Lancashire, UK). MHB supplemented with 0.5% Tween 80 (Polyoxyethylenesorbitan monooleate, HiMedia Laboratories Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai, India) was used for dissolving the EOs, as well as for their dilution to the concentration ranging from 1000 to 0.9 mg/mL. Twenty-microliter aliquots of each tested EO were added to 96-well microtiter plates. Afterward, aliquots of 160 µL of MHB were added to each well. As the final step, 20 µL of the standardized bacterial suspension was inoculated into each well. The test was performed in a total volume of 200 µL with final EOs’ concentrations ranging from 100 to 0.09 mg/mL, while the final microbial concentration was 10
 <sup>7</sup> CFU/mL. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The same tests were performed simultaneously for growth control (MHB + test organism), negative control (MHB + solvent + test organism), and sterility control (MHB + test oil).
