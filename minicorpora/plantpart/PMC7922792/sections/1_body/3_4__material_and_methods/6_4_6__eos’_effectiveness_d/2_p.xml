<p>Following the incubation, 10 µL of the resazurin solution (0.01%) (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) was added to each well. Subsequently, the plates were further incubated at 37 °C for 6 h (in darkness). After visual examination, the plates were additionally incubated for 18 h. Change of color from blue (oxidized) to pink (reduced) indicated the growth of bacteria. On completion of the incubation, wells without the color change (blue color of resazurin remained unchanged) were scored as above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value. MIC was defined as the lowest concentration at which the color change occurred [
