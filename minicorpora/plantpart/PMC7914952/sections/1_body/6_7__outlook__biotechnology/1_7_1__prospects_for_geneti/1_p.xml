<p>Enhancing agronomic performance is the main goal of genetic engineering of crop plants [
 <xref rid="B416-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">416</xref>]. The improvement of plant secondary metabolism, however, poses a number of challenges. Secondary metabolites vary from species to species [
 <xref rid="B417-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">417</xref>] and transferring pathways among plants requires knowledge of the involved enzymes and genes, which are often scattered over several chromosomes (see 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00883-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>) while related activities are catalyzed by similar enzymes [
 <xref rid="B418-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">418</xref>]. Since secondary pathways are often interconnected via common precursors and/or control elements, modifying the activity of one pathway can affect other pathways [
