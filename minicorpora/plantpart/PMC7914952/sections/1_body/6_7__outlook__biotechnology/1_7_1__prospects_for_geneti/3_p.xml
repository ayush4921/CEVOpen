<p>The perspectives of engineering lignan biosynthesis have been reviewed [

 <xref rid="B428-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">428</xref>]. Successful heterologous expression of several enzymes of the lignan pathway raises hope that manipulation of lignan biosynthesis in sesame becomes possible soon. Apart from heterologous expression in 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (see above), an encouraging result was achieved in wheat. Expression of pinoresinol lariciresinol reductase from 
 <italic>Forsythia</italic> under a strong maize promoter caused an increase in the secoisolariciresinol diglucoside level by a factor of 2.2 [
 <xref rid="B429-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">429</xref>]. We suppose that the effect might have been even stronger than reported. Firstly, only the level of diglucoside was determined, rather than the total level of the aglycon in the tissue. If glucosylation was a rate-limiting step in the synthesis of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside in manipulated wheat plants, monitoring secoisolariciresinol diglucoside underrated the level of secoisolariciresinol. Additionally, the analytes were extracted into diethyl ether, which does not appear suitable for the extraction of diglucosides due to its low polarity. Polar solvents used for the extraction of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside used so far were dioxane/ethanol [
 <xref rid="B430-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">430</xref>], methanol/water, and acetone/water [
 <xref rid="B431-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">431</xref>]. If the solubility of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside in diethyl ether was limited, which we assume was the case, the relative recovery of the analyte was lower in samples with higher analyte levels, leading to an underestimation of the differences between samples.
