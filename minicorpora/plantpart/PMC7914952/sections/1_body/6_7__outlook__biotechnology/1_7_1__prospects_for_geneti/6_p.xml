<p>The first attempt to transform 
 <italic>S. indicum</italic> using 
 <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> was undertaken in 1999 [
 <xref rid="B438-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">438</xref>] but the difficulty of regenerating sesame plants from callus hampered progress in the field. Careful selection of accessions amenable to transformation and the optimization of regeneration conditions eventually allowed for the development of a reliable transformation protocols with an acceptable transformation efficiency [

 <xref rid="B441-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">441</xref>]. A successful particle bombardment protocol for sesame was also developed [
