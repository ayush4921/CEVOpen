<p>Apart from overexpressing genes of metabolic pathways and fine-tuning genetic pathways by genome editing, suppression of undesirable branches of biosynthetic pathways can be achieved by RNA interference (RNAi). To manipulate metabolic pathways by RNAi, double-stranded RNA is produced in the cell to initiate degradation of undesirable mRNAs [

 <italic>LuPLR1</italic> gene in flax (
 <italic>L. usitatissimum</italic>) seeds. This gene encodes pinoresinol lariciresinol reductase, which is responsible for the synthesis of secoisolariciresinol, the major lignan accumulating in the seed coat of flax seeds [
 <xref rid="B420-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">420</xref>]. The precursor of secoisolariciresinol and the substrate for the silenced enzyme was pinoresinol, which accumulated in the engineered seeds to a higher level than in non-modified seeds. Furthermore, new lignans not found in wild type flax were identified in the transgenic seeds, indicating the complexity and potential pitfalls but also the potentials of genetic engineering of the lignan pathway. 
 <italic>Forsythia</italic> suspension cells were engineered for increase pinoresinol production by blocking the activity of pinoresinol/lariciresinol reductase. Cells transfected with a suitable RNAi construct exhibited a complete loss of matairesinol but accumulated 20-fold higher amounts of pinoresinol and its glucoside when compared to non-transformed cells [
