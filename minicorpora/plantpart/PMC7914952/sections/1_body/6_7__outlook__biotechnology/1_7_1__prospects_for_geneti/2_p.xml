<p>Heterologous expression of two genes of the lignan pathway of sesame allowed the conversion of pinoresinol to sesamin in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> [
 <xref rid="B243-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">243</xref>] and the production of sesamin in 
 <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> [
 <xref rid="B273-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">273</xref>]. In roots and seedlings of 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic> expressing the sesamin synthase gene, the content of sesamin reached 10–80 ng/mg dry weight [
 <xref rid="B273-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">273</xref>], which corresponds to 0.5–10% of the content of sesamin in sesame seeds (cf. 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00883-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Experiences from other systems indicate that optimization of growth conditions and stepwise genetic improvements will likely be needed for high-performance production systems for lignans [
 <xref rid="B425-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">425</xref>]. Cloning, characterization and manipulation of auxiliary enzymes such as UDP-glycosyltransferases will allow fine-tuning towards practical needs. Genes encoding UDP-lignan-glysosyltransferases from 
 <italic>S. indicum</italic>, 
 <italic>S. alatum</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. radiaum</italic> have been characterized with the explicit aim to facilitate engineering lignan biosynthesis [
