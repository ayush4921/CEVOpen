<p>Genetic engineering of metabolic pathways can be achieved in the course of the initiation of hairy root cultures because the process is based on genetic transformation. As 
 <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> and 
 <italic>A. rhizogenes</italic> use essentially the same mechanism for the transfer of DNA into plant cells and its integration into plant genome [
 <xref rid="B453-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">453</xref>], binary vectors developed for 
 <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> can be used with 
 <italic>A. rhizogenes</italic>, too [
 <xref rid="B454-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">454</xref>]. Transformation vectors derived from the root-inducing megaplasmid of 
 <italic>R. rhizogenes</italic> are available [

 <italic>Isatis indigoticas</italic> increased from 24 mg/g to 96 mg/g by overexpression of a single gene of the lignan pathway (the gene IiC3H encoding P450 hydroxylase; [

 <italic>S. indicum</italic> can be generated easily (e.g., [

 <xref rid="B456-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">456</xref>]) and many genes of the lignan pathway have been characterized (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec4dot1-molecules-26-00883">Section 4.1</xref>), genetically modified hairy roots appear to be a feasible approach towards engineering lignan synthesis in sesame.
