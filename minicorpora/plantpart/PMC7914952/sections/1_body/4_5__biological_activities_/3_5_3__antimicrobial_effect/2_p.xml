 <xref rid="B372-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">372</xref>]. Bussey and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B373-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">373</xref>] reported low MIC values, ranging from 8 to 150 Âµg/mL, for sesamin in nontuberculous mycobacteria. Their results suggested that sesamin and asarinin (episesamin) likely accounted for the medical effects of roots of 
 <italic>Anemopsis californica</italic>, which is used in the folk medicine of North American tribes, and which contains high levels of both lignans. Sesamin and episesamin might thus have potential for the treatment of infections with nontuberculous bacteria.
