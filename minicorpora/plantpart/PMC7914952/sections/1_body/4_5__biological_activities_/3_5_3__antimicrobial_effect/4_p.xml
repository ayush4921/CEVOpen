<p>Sesamol, which is a degradation product of sesamolin, inhibited lipid metabolism and growth of the zygomycetous fungus 
 <italic>Mucor circinelloides,</italic> but the growth inhibition was moderate, amounting to 10% at 1.5 mM sesamol [
 <xref rid="B376-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">376</xref>]. At a concentration of 7 mM, sesamol completely inhibited the growth of several basidiomycetous and ascomycetous fungi and yeast [
 <xref rid="B376-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">376</xref>]. This concentration (ca. 1 mg/mL) is too high for practical applications. Similarly, sesamol at a concentration of 2.5 mM inhibited lipid metabolism and growth in the plant pathogenic fungus 
 <italic>Fusarium verticillioides</italic> [
 <xref rid="B377-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">377</xref>]. For a comparison, the MIC of a weakly fungicidal preservative sorbic acid was reported 2 mM for mycelial growth of 
 <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> [
 <xref rid="B378-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">378</xref>] and 2.7 to 5.4 mM for 
 <italic>Penicillium verrucosum</italic> and 
 <italic>Aspergillus westerdijkiae</italic> [
 <xref rid="B379-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">379</xref>]. Antifungal plant metabolites inhibit fungal growth at concentrations that are two orders of magnitude lower [
