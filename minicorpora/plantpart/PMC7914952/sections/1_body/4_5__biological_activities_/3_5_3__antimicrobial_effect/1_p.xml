<p>Kumar and Singh [
 <xref rid="B207-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">207</xref>] investigated the growth inhibition of three bacteria by sesamin, sesamolin, and sesamol. Sesamol at 2 mg/mL blocked the growth of 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus,</italic> but not 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa,</italic> while sesamin and sesamol at a concentration of 2 mg/mL have not reached the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC). Based on these results, the authors suggested that sesamol could be used as an antimicrobial agent against food borne pathogens. We regard the reported MIC value as too high for practical applications.
