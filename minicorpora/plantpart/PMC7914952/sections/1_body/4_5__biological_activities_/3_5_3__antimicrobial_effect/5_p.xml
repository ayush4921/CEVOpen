<p>To summarize, sesame lignans do not seem promising as general antibiotics or antimycotics, but they may be developed for special niches, such as dimorphic human-pathogenic fungi (demonstrated effect of pinoresinol) and nontuberculous bacteria (demonstrated effect of sesamin). Furthermore, products based on sesame lignans may prevent contamination of food commodities with trichothecene mycotoxins (demonstrated effect on trichothecene synthesis in
