<p>Hwang and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B374-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">374</xref>] reported toxicity of (+)-pinoresinol to 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, 
 <italic>Trichosporon beigelii</italic>, and 
 <italic>Malassezia furfur</italic> with MIC values of 12-25 µg/mL. Kulik and coworkers studied the effects of pinoresinol and secoisolariciresinol on the plant pathogenic fungus 
 <italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B375-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">375</xref>]. They have not determined MIC values but reported that both lignans inhibited the growth of the fungus by 5–45% (depending on the strain) at a concentration of 5 µg/mL. More interestingly, pinoresinol at this concentration suppressed the transcription of the biosynthesis pathway for trichothecene mycotoxins nivalenol and deoxynivalenol, and it strongly reduced the level of mycotoxins accumulating in culture medium [
