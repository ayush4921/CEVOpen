<p>In a search for new insecticides, strengthening of the activity of pyrethrum and rotenone insecticides by sesame oil was discovered, immediately introduced into practice, and protected by a patent [

 <xref rid="B383-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">383</xref>], but both labs noticed that sesame oil depleted of sesamin was still active and speculated that additional component(s) contributed to the effect. Soon after, (+)-episesamin (called isosesamin) and asarinin (which is (-)-episesamin) were shown to enhance the effect of insecticides in an extent comparable to sesamin [

 <xref rid="B384-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">384</xref>] and the search for further active components continued. The next synergist identified was sesamolin, which turned out to be even more potent than sesamin [
