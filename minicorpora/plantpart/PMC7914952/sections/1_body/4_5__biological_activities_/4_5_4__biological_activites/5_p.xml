<p>Lopseed (
 <italic>Phryma leptostachya</italic>) contains fufofuran lignans that are similar to lignans of sesame because they contain two methylenedioxobenzyl groups, some of which are methoxylated [

One of these lignans (haedoxan A), which contained a benzodioxolan moiety inserted between the furofuran kernel and one of the methylenedioxobenzenes, exhibited very strong stomach toxicity as well as topical toxicity in two pests. The activity of the other lignans, which were more similar to furofuran lignans of sesame, was however weak [
