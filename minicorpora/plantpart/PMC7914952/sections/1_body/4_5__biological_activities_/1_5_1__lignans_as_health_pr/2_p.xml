<p>Antioxidant activity of lignans and tocopherol account for part of the health benefits of sesame consumption (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec5dot2dot1-molecules-26-00883">Section 5.2.1</xref>). However, interactions with specific molecular targets and activation or suppression of signal transduction pathways by lignans have also been reported. The latter may be pharmacologically interesting. Suitability of a compound as oral drug can be assessed by predicting its absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (so-called ADMET profile) from physicochemical properties such as molecular weight, water solubility, dipole moment, and lipophilicity. Pilkington carried out such a chemometric analysis for lignans [
 <xref rid="B281-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">281</xref>]. She found that most lignans including the furofuran lignans of sesame did not possess lead-like properties, indicating that their derivatives would not have a good chance to become real-world therapeutics, but they fulfilled the requirements for drug-like compounds. To be potentially useful for the prevention or treatment of diseases, compounds classified as drug-like by chemometry must possess suitable biological activities. The following sections provide ample support for such activities of lignans of sesame.
