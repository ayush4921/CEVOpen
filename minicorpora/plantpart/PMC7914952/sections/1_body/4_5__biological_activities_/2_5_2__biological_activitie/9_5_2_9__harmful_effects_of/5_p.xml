<p>Many lignans exert estrogenic effects, which may be useful for estrogen replacement therapy (see

 <xref rid="B370-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">370</xref>]. Furthermore, pinoresinol and matairesinol exerted moderate antiestrogen activity rather than acting as phytoestrogens in a yeast strain containing estrogen receptor and a reporter gene under control of an estrogen-responsive element [
 <xref rid="B309-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">309</xref>]. Molecular docking revealed that the difference between estrogenic lignans, such as enterodiol, and antiestrogenic lignans pinoresinol and matairesinol might be explained by the ability of different lignans to bind to and stabilize different forms of the receptor. Because the concentration of pinoresinol in sesame oil is lower than the concentrations of estrogenic lignans, and matairesinol occurs only in traces (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00883-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), the antiestrogenic effects of pinoresinol and matairesinol do not appear relevant for human nutrition.
