As with other food commodities, allergenic potential of sesame only manifests in consumers with an allergic disease of a matching specificity. Therefore, it cannot be regarded as a general foodborne health risk. Certain health effects of sesame lignans actually suppress allergic reactions; for instance, sesamin attenuated allergic inflammation in an asthma model in rat [
