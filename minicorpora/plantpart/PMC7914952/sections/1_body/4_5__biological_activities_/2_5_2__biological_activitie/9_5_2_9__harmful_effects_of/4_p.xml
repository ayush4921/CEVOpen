<p>Sesamin and episesamin were investigated for genotoxicity (Ames test), chromosomal aberrations in mammalian cell cultures, and effects on DNA and chromatin in vivo [
 <xref rid="B369-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">369</xref>]. Both lignans were not genotoxic. In all other tests, episesamin was also negative, whereas sesamin at high concentrations caused chromosomal aberrations in vitro. These effects were not confirmed in vivo after oral administration of sesamin up to 2 g/kg, indicating that the consumption of sesamin is not a food safety risk [
