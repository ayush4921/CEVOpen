<p>Dietary sesamin stimulated the oxidation of fatty acids and suppressed triacylglycerol synthesis, decreasing lipogenesis in rat [

In hypercholesteromic mice, however, sesamin neither attenuated the elevation of cholesterol level caused by diet containing 0.25% cholesterol nor enhanced the effect of stanol esters, which are plant steroids reducing cholesterol level in blood [
