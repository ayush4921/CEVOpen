<p>Dietary interventions in humans generated mixed results. A short-term dietary intervention with 60 mg sesamin per day significantly reduced the blood pressure of mildly hypertensive probands [

A randomized, placebo-controlled study in overweight men and women provided sesame seed equivalents containing 50 mg sesamin per day has not shown any reduction of blood lipids or blood pressure and the markers of systemic inflammation and lipid peroxidation were not affected, though urinary excretion confirmed that lignans were absorbed and metabolized [
