<p>Protection from oxidative damage (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec5dot2dot1-molecules-26-00883">Section 5.2.1</xref>) was suggested to account for the neuroprotective effects of sesame lignans [
 <xref rid="B136-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>]. One of the strongest oxidants in the body is hypochlorous acid, which is produced by oxidation of chloride with hydrogen peroxide catalyzed by myeloperoxidase. Oxidative damage caused by reactive products of myeloperoxidase activity is believed to contribute to a range of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease and multiple sclerosis [

 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec5dot2dot1-molecules-26-00883">Section 5.2.1</xref>), inhibition of myeloperoxidase [
