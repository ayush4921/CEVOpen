<p>Ischemic stroke may cause neuronal damage due to reduced supply of oxygen and glucose to the brain. Orally administered sesamin exerted significant neuroprotection in mouse model of ischemic stroke, reduced infarction volume, and modulated signaling pathways in mouse brain, resulting in reduced inflammatory and stress markers [

Orally administered sesamin and a mixture of sesamin and sesamolin alleviated the effect of cerebral ischemia in gerbils introduced by surgical occlusion of the right carotid artery by reducing the brain damage caused by hypoxis [

In the same study, quenching of nitrogen oxide production by rat microglial cells treated with lipopolysaccharides by sesamin and sesamolin was demonstrated, providing a rationale for the neuroprotective effect of lignans on primary microglia [
