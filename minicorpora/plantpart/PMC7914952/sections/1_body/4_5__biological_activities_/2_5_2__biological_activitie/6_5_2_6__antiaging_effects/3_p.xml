<p>In a mice senescence model, induced by chronic subcutaneous injections of D-galactose, oral administration of sesamin suppressed the decline of cognitive and motor capabilities, the loss of body weight, the changes in liver enzyme activities, and the increase of liver malondialdehyde and other markers of oxidative stress [
