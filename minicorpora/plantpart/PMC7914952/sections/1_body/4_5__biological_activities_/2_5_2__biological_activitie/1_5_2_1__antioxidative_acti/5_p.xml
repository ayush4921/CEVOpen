<p>The third group encompasses the products of lignan degradation with high antioxidative activities such as sesamol. Sesamol, which is formed from sesamolin during roasting (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot2dot1-molecules-26-00883">Section 2.2.1</xref>), has a higher antioxidant activity than sesamin and sesamolin [
 <xref rid="B291-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">291</xref>]. The benzodioxole group of sesamol scavenges hydroxyl radicals, presumably producing 1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene (hydroxyquinol) [
 <xref rid="B292-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">292</xref>]. Antioxidative activity of sesamol was demonstrated in many systems in vitro as well as in vivo. For instance, sesamol inhibited lipid peroxidation in rat liver microsomes [
