<p>Even though sesamolin has been reported to have no antioxidant activity by Kamal-Eldin and Appelqvist [
 <xref rid="B87-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>], sesamolin can act as an antioxidant in vivo, as demonstrated by Kang et al. [
 <xref rid="B286-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">286</xref>]. The authors fed rats with a diet containing sesamolin and investigated the metabolism of the lignan as well as its effects on the animals. In addition, Suja et al. [
 <xref rid="B287-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">287</xref>] showed that sesamolin exhibited stronger effects than sesamin despite having the lowest superoxide-scavenging effect in vitro. Pinoresinol has also been shown to exert moderate anti-oxidative activity on scavenging 2,2-diphenyl-1picrylhydrazyl radical [
