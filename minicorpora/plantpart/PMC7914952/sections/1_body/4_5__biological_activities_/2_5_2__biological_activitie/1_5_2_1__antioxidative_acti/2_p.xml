<p>Regarding the antioxidative activity of glycosides and aglycons, sesame lignans can be classified into three groups. Lignans of the first group possess antioxidative activities both in glycosylated or unglycosylated form (sesamin, sesaminol, sesamolinol and pinoresinol). The antioxidant activity of sesamin and sesamolin in vitro is weak since they do not possess phenolic hydroxyl groups [

In this process, the methylenedioxyphenyl moieties of sesamin were sequentially opened and demethylated, yielding metabolites with one or two catechol moieties. These metabolites exhibited radical scavenging and antioxidative activities similar to pure catechol [
