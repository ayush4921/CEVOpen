<p>The estrogenic effects of phytoestrogens may disrupt hormonal balance of the bodies of males, impairing male fertility. To assess this risk, researchers in Lagos, Nigeria, evaluated the chronic reproductive toxicity of sesame lignans in male rats [

 <italic>S. radiatum</italic> extracts increased the testicular weight and sperm count and motility in rats. The authors concluded that lignans of sesame improved the sperm quality in a dose-dependent manner; however, the content of lignans and other metabolites potentially responsible for the effects remained unknown. Studies with pure lignans are needed to confirm the results.
