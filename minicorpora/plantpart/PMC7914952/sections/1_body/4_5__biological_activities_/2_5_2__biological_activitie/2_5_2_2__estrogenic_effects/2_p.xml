<p>Enterolignans enterodiol and enterolactone, produced in the digestion track of mammals (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot2dot3-molecules-26-00883">Section 2.2.3</xref>), affected gene expression in the liver in a similar way as their precursors matairesinol, pinoresinol and sesamin, and directly activated the estrogen signaling pathway [

 <xref rid="B307-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">307</xref>] demonstrated that enterolactone, sesamin, sesamolin and sesamol possessed estrogenic activities. Sesamol, which is commercially available, possessed the highest activity, even higher than enterolactone.
