<p>Sesaminol glucosides inhibited the development of colonic precancerous lesions in vivo and protected rats from induced tumors [
 <xref rid="B320-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">320</xref>]. Aglycon of sesaminol inhibited several human cancer cell lines in vitro stronger than normal cells, including breast, skin, lung, and colorectal cancer [
 <xref rid="B321-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">321</xref>]. The strongest inhibition was observed in lung carcinoma cells. Investigating the mode of action, the authors found out that in lung and colorectal cancer cells, sesaminol reduced the level of cell cycle regulator cyclin D1. Identification of the sesaminol-binding proteins (mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocase) shed light on the mechanisms of overexpression of cyclin D1 in cancer cells and its suppression by sesaminol [
