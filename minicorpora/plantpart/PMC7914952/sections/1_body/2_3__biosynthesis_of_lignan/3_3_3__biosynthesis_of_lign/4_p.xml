<p>Lignans normally accumulate as glucosides. In 
 <italic>Forsythia</italic> and 
 <italic>Linum</italic>, the enzyme UGT71A18 is responsible for the glucosylation of furofuran lignans [(+)-pinoresinol, (+)-epipinoresinol and (+)-phylligenin] [

 <italic>Forsythia</italic> UGTs were suggested for matairesinol glucosylation (CL10456contig1, CL14684contig1 and CL15275contig1) based on molecular analyses of virtual primer-based sequences assembly (VP-seq) [
