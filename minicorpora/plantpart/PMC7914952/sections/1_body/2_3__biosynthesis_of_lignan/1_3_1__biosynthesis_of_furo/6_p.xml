<p>In 
 <italic>S. indicum</italic>, the biosynthesis of furofuran lignans continues from (+)-sesaminol through a series of glucosylation steps (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00883-f009">Figure 9</xref>). The final product is sesaminol triglucoside (STG), which is a water-soluble lignan that accumulates in high amounts in sesame seeds [
 <xref rid="B102-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. The three glucosylation steps of (+)-sesaminol are catalyzed by uridine diphosphate (UDP)-dependent glycosyltransferases (UGTs) (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00883-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). The first glucose is always connected to the lignan aglycon via a β-glycosidic bond while the second and third glucose molecules are connected via 1,4- or 1,6-β-glycosidic bonds.
