<p>Murata and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B246-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">246</xref>] showed that CYP92B14, a P450 monooxygenase, is responsible for the oxygenation of (+)-sesamin to form (+)-sesamolin or (+)-sesaminol via oxidative rearrangement of an Î±-oxy-substituted aryl group or direct hydroxylation, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00883-f009">Figure 9</xref>). They also demonstrated the functional coordination between CYP92B14 and CYP81Q1 (both P450 enzymes), in which the activity of the former enzyme is enhanced by CYP81Q1.
