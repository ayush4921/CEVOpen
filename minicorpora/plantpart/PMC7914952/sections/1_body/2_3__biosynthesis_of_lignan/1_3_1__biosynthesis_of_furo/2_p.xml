<p>Until 2006, it was believed that in 
 <italic>S. indicum</italic>, (+)-pinoresinol was converted to (+)-piperitol and then to (+)-sesamin by two consecutively acting P450 enzymes tentatively designated piperitol synthase and sesamin synthase [

 <italic>S. indicum</italic>, the same cytochrome P450 enzyme (CYP81Q1) catalyzes the formation of both, (+)-piperitol and (+)-sesamin, through dual methylenedioxy bridge formation (

 <italic>S. indicum</italic> was confirmed in a heterologous system, and it was demonstrated that the CYP reductase1 gene product (CPR1) is needed for pinoresinol to sesamin conversion to facilitate electron transfer from NADPH to the CYP81Q1 enzyme [
