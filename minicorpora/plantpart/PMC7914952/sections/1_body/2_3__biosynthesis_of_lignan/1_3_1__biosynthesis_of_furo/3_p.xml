<p>Ono and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B85-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>] found homologs of CYP81Q1 protein in 
 <italic>S. radiatum</italic> (CYP81Q2) and 
 <italic>S. alatum</italic> (CYP81Q3). Recently, it was demonstrated that, unlike CYP81Q1 and CYP81Q2, the CYP81Q3 protein from the wild 
 <italic>Sesamum</italic> species 
 <italic>S. alatum,</italic> produces only a single methylenedioxy bridge and has diastereomeric selectivity, i.e., it can catalyze the formation of (+)-pluviatilol from (+)-epipinoresinol but it accepts neither (+) nor (-)-pinoresinol as a substrate [
 <xref rid="B89-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Due to the absence of CYP81Q1, 
 <italic>S. alatum</italic> cannot synthesize molecules with dual methylenedioxy bridges such as (+)-sesamin and (+)-sesamolin. Instead, this species accumulates furofuran lignans with single methylenedioxy bridges, e.g., (+)-2-episesalatin and (+)-fargesin (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00883-f010">Figure 10</xref>). The asymmetric configuration of (+)-epipinoresinol is probably the reason for the inability of the CYP81Q3 enzyme to form the second methylenedioxy bridge, and for the hydroxylation or 
 <italic>O</italic>-methylation of the second aromatic ring of (+)-pluviatilol to form (+)-2-episesalatin [
