<p>Pinoresinol is the precursor of the main furofuran lignans in sesame, i.e., the hydrophobic lignans (+)-sesamin and (+)-sesamolin and the water-soluble STG. However, pinoresinol is also the precursor of dibenzylbutyrolactone class of lignans, which in most plants are produced via reductive cleavage of furofuran rings by pinoresinol–lariciresinol reductases (PLR). These enzymes convert pinoresinol to lariciresinol and then to secoisolariciresinol [
