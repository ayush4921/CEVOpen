<p>Total synthesis of lignans will be briefly outlined in this section. Industrial synthesis of sesamol, introduced in the 1950th [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], provides sesamol at a much lower price than the extraction from sesame oil. Several synthetic strategies were exploited, continuously improving the industrial production [

A number of synthetic routes for native furofuran lignans have been reported since the 1990th, but none proved suitable for industrial use. The main challenge for the chemical synthesis of lignans was the control of stereochemistry of the furofuran core. The synthesis of tetrahydrofuran lignans is less complex; lariciresinol [
 <xref rid="B82-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>] was synthesized in 1994. Lignans of both tetrahydrofuran and furofuran families including pinoresinol, piperitol, and sesamin were obtained by radical cyclization of epoxides [

 <xref rid="B161-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>]. An elegant bioinspired yet not biomimetic approach to furofuran lignans was the exocyclization of biaryl cyclobutane, which afforded pinoresinol [
 <xref rid="B162-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>]. Sesamin and sesaminol were also synthesized by crossed aldol reaction with a quinomethide intermediate [
