<p>In their seminal work, Katsuzaki and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B52-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] characterized three diglucosides of pinoresinol: two diglucosides with both glucose molecules attached to the same methoxyphenol moiety and another diglucoside with glucose molecules attached to different methoxyphenols. These three diglucosides were present in sesame seeds in comparable concentrations. However, only the latter compound, with glucose molecules attached to different methoxyphenol moieties of pinoresinol, was used in all biomedical studies on pinoresinol diglucoside that we are aware of (e.g., [
