<p>What is the reason for this bias? To our knowledge, only pinoresinol di-
 <italic>O</italic>-β-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucoside is available commercially, e.g., from Sigma-Aldrich, Selleckchem, Cayman Chemicals, ChemFaces, Adooq Bioscience, Apexbio, and other suppliers. The companies that specified the source always named 
 <italic>Eucommia ulmoides</italic>. We speculate that all commercial pinoresinol diglucoside originates from the bark of 
 <italic>E. ulmoides</italic> rather than sesame [

 <italic>E. ulmoides</italic> is a tree cultivated in China for the production of gutta-percha [
 <xref rid="B116-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. Extracts of the bark are used in Chinese traditional medicine (杜仲 [dù zhòng], in English known as tu-chung) [
 <xref rid="B117-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. While all isomers of sesaminol diglucosides are available from Japanese companies Nakalai Tesque and Nagara Science, we are not aware of a commercial source of pinoresinol 4′-
 <italic>O</italic>-β-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucopyranosyl-β-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucopyranosides. We assume that the availability of pinoresinol di-
 <italic>O</italic>-β-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucoside from 
 <italic>E. ulmoides</italic> on the market accounts for the bias of research on biomedical effects of pinoresinol diglucoside. Comparative studies with all three diglucosides are highly desirable.
