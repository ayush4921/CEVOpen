<p>Haworth introduced the term lignan in 1936 for phenolic metabolites of plants that consist of two n-propylbenzene moieties [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Phenylpropanoid monomers are connected via Î²-atoms of the propane chains [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. According to the cyclization pattern and the presence and location of oxygens, lignans are divided into eight classes [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00883-f001">Figure 1</xref>) belong to the furofuran family. In furofuran lignans, the oxopropane side chains of phenylpropanoid building units are fused into 3,7-dioxabicyclo[3.3.0]octane (

 <italic>Sesamum indicum</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00883-f002">Figure 2</xref>) belong to the furofuran, tetrahydrofuran, and butyrolactone classes; further lignans are produced by the degradation and transformation of furofuran lignans. Chemical properties of lignans of
