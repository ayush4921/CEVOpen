<p>All 
 <italic>Sesamum</italic> species studied so far produce lignans. Sesamin and sesamolin were detected in most species and we assume that all 
 <italic>Sesamum</italic> species produce these two lignans, though most species accumulate them in lower levels than 
 <italic>S. indicum</italic>. In addition to sesamin and sesamolin, some sesame species produce unique lignans not occurring in 
 <italic>S. indicum</italic> (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00883-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). These species are of commercial interest as a source of enzymes and genes for the engineering of lignan biosynthesis (K. Dossa, personal communication).
