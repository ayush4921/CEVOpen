<p>The presence of pinoresinol monoglucoside in sesame is the first out of two controversial questions regarding pinoresinol glucosides in sesame. Some authors claimed that sesame seeds contained pinoresinol monoglucoside, but we were unable to find published data substantiating their claim. Moazzami et al. [
 <xref rid="B100-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>] listed pinoresinol mono-, di- and triglucosides as components of sesame seeds in the introduction section of their paper, citing Katsuzaki et al. [
 <xref rid="B76-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>], but the cited paper does not support the presence of pinoresinol monoglucoside in sesame. The authors repeated the claim in another paper published in the same year [
 <xref rid="B101-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>], citing the same work by Katsuzaki et al. [
 <xref rid="B76-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] and two papers of their own [
 <xref rid="B100-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>,
 <xref rid="B102-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. None of the cited papers supported the claim.
