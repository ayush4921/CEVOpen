<p>Pathak et al. [
 <xref rid="B103-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>] listed pinoresinol monoglucoside among the component of sesame seeds in their review of bioactive compounds in sesame, citing the seminal work by Katsuzaki et al. [
 <xref rid="B52-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] and the publication by Moazzami et al. [
 <xref rid="B102-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>] mentioned above. None of these publications dealt with pinoresinol monoglucoside. Dar and Arumugan [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] listed pinoresinol monoglucoside among the lignans of sesame, citing several publications, yet none of the cited papers supported the claim. Gerstenmeyer and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B104-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>] reported that they presumably detected pinoresinol monoglucoside in sesame seed by HPLC-MS based on the 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> value of its molecular ion, yet they could not verify the identity of the analyte due to the lack of a standard.
