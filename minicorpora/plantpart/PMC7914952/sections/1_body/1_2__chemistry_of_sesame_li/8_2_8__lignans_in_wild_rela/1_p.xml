<p>Several lignans known from 
 <italic>S. indicum</italic> and new lignans not known from cultivated sesame have been found in wild relatives of sesame (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00883-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In 1951, Pearman and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B234-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">234</xref>] as cited by [
 <xref rid="B66-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] reported sesamin from 
 <italic>Sesamum angolense</italic>. Bedigian and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B66-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] screened several wild species of sesame for the presence of sesamin and sesamolin. They confirmed the presence of sesamin and sesamolin in 
 <italic>S. angolense</italic> and found these two lignans also in the seeds of 
 <italic>S. angustifolium</italic>, 
 <italic>S. calycinum</italic>, and in 
 <italic>S. orientale var. malabaricum</italic>. Only sesamin was found in 
 <italic>S. latifolium</italic> and 
 <italic>S. radiatum</italic>. In addition, trace amounts of sesamin and sesamolin were also observed in 
 <italic>S. petaloides</italic> and 
 <italic>S. capense,</italic> respectively. Bedigian and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B66-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] also reported the presence of lignans in the seeds of related genera: sesamin was found in 
 <italic>Ceratotheca sesamoides</italic>, and both sesamin and sesamolin were found in 
 <italic>Sesamothamnus busseanus</italic>. In addition, the authors found trace amounts of sesamolin in 
 <italic>Ceratotheca sesamoides</italic> and trace amounts of sesamin in 
 <italic>Ceratotheca triloba</italic>, 
 <italic>Holubia saccata, Pedalium murex,</italic> and 
 <italic>Pretrea zanguebaricum</italic>.
