<p>Future studies relying on HPLC coupled with tandem mass spectrometric or high-resolution mass-spectrometric detection will likely render old results based on TLC obsolete. Apart from the accessibility of more powerful analytical techniques, the lesson learned from the past is that chemists analyzing wild relatives of sesame should always seek assistance of plant taxonomists specialized in Pedaliaceae to verify the taxonomic assignment of their samples. Species-specific DNA barcodes, which allow reliable taxonomic assignments to non-specialists, are not available in 
 <italic>Sesamum</italic> spp. yet. Because the content of lignans varies greatly among accessions of the same species (e.g., [

 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot6-molecules-26-00883">Section 2.6</xref>), reports of phytochemical analysis should include information about the origin of the samples. Many past studies provided limited or no information about their samples, impeding comparison among studies.
