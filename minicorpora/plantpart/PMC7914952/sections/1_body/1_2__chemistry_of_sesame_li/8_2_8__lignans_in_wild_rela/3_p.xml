<p>Apart from a limited specificity of TLC used for lignan analysis in old studies, some studies of lignans in wild relatives of cultivated sesame were plagued by erroneous taxonomic assignments. 
 <italic>S. latifolium</italic> was mistaken for 
 <italic>S. radiatum</italic> in two studies [
 <xref rid="B87-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>,
 <xref rid="B179-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">179</xref>] published in 1994, as the author noted in her subsequent publication from 2010 [
 <xref rid="B95-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>] (see footnote 4 in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00883-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Thus, papers published between 1994 and 2010 might have spread the wrong data; an example is an industrial compendium on oils [
 <xref rid="B235-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">235</xref>]. Recently, a Suntory Foundation for Life Sciences and their collaborators in Japan [
 <xref rid="B92-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>] re-investigated the content of lignans in seeds of 
 <italic>S. radiatum</italic>, confirmed sesamin and sesamolin, and discovered the sesangolin isomer (+)-7â€²-episesantalin. Likewise, they re-discovered the presence of (+)-sesangolin, apparently not aware of the publication by Su Rho Ruy and coworkers from 1993 in Korean language, in which sesangolin was reported from 
 <italic>S. radiatum</italic> for the first time [
 <xref rid="B88-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>].
