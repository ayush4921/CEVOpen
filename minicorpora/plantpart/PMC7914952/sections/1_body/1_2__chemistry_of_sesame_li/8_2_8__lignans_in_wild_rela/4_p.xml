<p>Some controversies about taxonomic assignments in these studies remain unresolved. For instance, in 2010 Kamal-Eldin [
 <xref rid="B95-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>] reported the content of sesamin and sesamolin in 
 <italic>S. latifolium</italic> as published in 1988 in a Japanese journal [
 <xref rid="B72-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], but in the cited publication 
 <italic>S. radiatum</italic> rather than 
 <italic>S. latifolium</italic> was named. Kamal-Eldin [
 <xref rid="B95-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>] did not explain why she assumed that 
 <italic>S. radiatum</italic> in this publication [
 <xref rid="B72-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] was actually 
 <italic>S. latifolium</italic>.
