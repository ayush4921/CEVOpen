<p>As shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00883-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, lignans do not accumulate in organs and tissues other than seeds to appreciable levels. The repertoire of lignans in callus tissue is limited to sesamin and sesamolin, while sesamin also accumulated in the roots and hairy roots of sesame [
 <xref rid="B231-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">231</xref>]. Sesamin content in the leaves and young and old callus amounted to less than 5% of the levels in seeds; similarly, sesamolin content in young and old callus amounted to less than 5% of the levels reported in seeds (
