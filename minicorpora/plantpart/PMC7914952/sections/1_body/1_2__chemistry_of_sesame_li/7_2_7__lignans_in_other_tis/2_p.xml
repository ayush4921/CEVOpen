<p>Sesamin was also reported from sesame leaves [

 <xref rid="B231-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">231</xref>]. Sesamin concentrations in leaves were ca. 5000-times lower than the concentrations in seeds of the same varieties [
 <xref rid="B232-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">232</xref>]. In the roots of most of 25 sesame varieties studied, the concentration of sesamin has not exceeded 10 mg/kg, which is 70 to 900-times less than the sesamin content in seeds (cf.

 <xref rid="B231-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">231</xref>] did not find lignans other than sesamin in the roots. Fuji and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B233-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">233</xref>], studying non-lignan metabolites of sesame, reported that they found sesamin and sesamolin in leaves, stem, root, and flower of sesame. The analytical method used was HPLC with both UV absorption and ESI-MS detection. The authors claimed that they validated their results using HPLC-ESI-MS/MS. The publication, however, does not show any analytical data on lignans [
 <xref rid="B233-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">233</xref>]. We have not found sesamin or sesamolin in any part of sesame plants except for capsules with seeds, leaves, and roots (unpublished data).
