Caraway, rapeseed, hemp, peanut, sunflower, pumpkin, poppy, and other edible oils were found to contain sesamin and sesamolin at the same ratio that is known from sesame. The oils were not declared to contain any sesame oil. The authors of the study suggested that sesame lignans in these oils resulted from unintended contamination; pointed out the risk for consumers allergic to sesame; and recommended cleaning the processing equipment thoroughly [

We would not rule out that certain companies may add undeclared sesame oil to their products intentionally to extend their shelf life, which would violate food law and possibly also infringe patent rights. Therefore, including sesame lignans in food safety monitoring appears advisable even for oils and fats that are not declared to contain sesame oil. Large number of suspicious products can be pre-tested using a simple colorimetric assay (e.g., [
