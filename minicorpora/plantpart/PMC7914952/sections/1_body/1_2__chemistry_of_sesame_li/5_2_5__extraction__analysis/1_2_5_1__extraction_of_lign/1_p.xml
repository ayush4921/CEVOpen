<p>The polarity of lignan molecules is low to medium, but extraction protocols have to take into account that most lignans are glycosylated and the solubility of di- and tri-glycosides in organic solvents is limited. The extraction of sesame seeds with 80% ethanol, which is suitable for aglycons as well as glycosylated lignans, was developed in 1998 [

 <xref rid="B178-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">178</xref>]). The levels on unglycosylated lignans reported in these studies were likely underestimated because lignans dissolve in n-hexane to a certain extent. Many groups actually extracted lignans from sesame into n-hexane [

Defatting seeds with n-hexane (or cyclohexane, which has similar properties and is preferable because of lower toxicity) can be safely used before extraction of glycosylated lignans [
