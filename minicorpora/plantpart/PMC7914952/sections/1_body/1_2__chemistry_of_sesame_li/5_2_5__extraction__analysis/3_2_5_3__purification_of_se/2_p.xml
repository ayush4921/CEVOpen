<p>Liquid-liquid extraction can be used to enrich particular lignans in extracts before purification. For instance, partition between n-hexane and water enriched piperitol and pinoresinol in the water phase, and subsequent partition between water and ethyl acetate enriched both compounds in the ethyl acetate phase [
