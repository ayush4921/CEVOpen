<p>An interesting liquid-liquid extraction of lignans from sesame oil into unconventional solvent γ-butyrolactone was developed for the production of pyrethrin synergists by the Norda Essential Oil and Chemical Company in New York [
 <xref rid="B209-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">209</xref>]. According to this method, a mixture of sesame oil and γ-butyrolactone is heated to 130 °C until a homogeneous solution is obtained. After cooling to 60 °C, solvent and oil separate. Lignans are obtained from the solvent layer after removal of γ-butyrolactone by distillation.
