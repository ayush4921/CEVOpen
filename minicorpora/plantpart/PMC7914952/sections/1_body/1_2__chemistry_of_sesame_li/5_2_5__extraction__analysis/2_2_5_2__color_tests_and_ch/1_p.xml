<p>Before chromatography became established in the analysis of sesame oil, color reactions and photometry in UV light were used to detect certain lignans and semi-quantitatively estimate their concentration. Villavecchia’s colorimetric test [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00883-f007">Figure 7</xref>), which was labeled with 5–10% sesame oil in the first half of the 19th century [

 <xref rid="B187-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">187</xref>]. Villavecchia test became the official method of the American Oil Chemists’ Society for the detection of sesame oil in vegetable and animal oils and fats [

 <xref rid="B190-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">190</xref>]. When Budowski and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B81-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>] recognized that sesamolin produced the same color reaction because it was converted into sesamol under acidic conditions of the test, they developed a photometric test based on light absorption of the product of furfural-sulfuric acid reaction with sesamol at 518 nm. They also established an analytical method for sesamin based on UV absorption of oil after removal of sesamol by treatment with alkali [

 <xref rid="B62-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] combined their method with the Villavecchia reaction for the determination of the content of sesamol, sesamolin and sesamin in oil. A new method for rapid estimation of total lignans in sesame oil relying merely on the light absorption at 288 nm was developed as recently as in 2015 [
