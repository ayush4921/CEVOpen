<p>Normal-phase chromatography on analytical columns for the analysis of sesamin, sesamol and sesamolin was available since the 1950â€™s [
 <xref rid="B63-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and especially two-dimensional TLC [
 <xref rid="B192-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">192</xref>] and HPTLC [
 <xref rid="B193-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">193</xref>] were used in parallel with normal-phase liquid chromatography [
 <xref rid="B123-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>] untill recently. Gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometric detection (GC-MS) was introduced into lignan analysis in the 1990s [

 <xref rid="B142-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>] and is still used [
 <xref rid="B194-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">194</xref>]. A thorough comparison of TLC, GC-MS, and HPLC-UV was carried out by Kamal-Eldin and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B142-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>]. Normal-phase HPLC is still used occasionally, as recently shown for sesamin, sesamol and sesamolin [
 <xref rid="B195-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">195</xref>], but reverse-phase columns eluted with water-methanol or water-acetonitrile gradients have superseded normal-phase chromatography in the meantime in most methods for lignan analysis [
 <xref rid="B101-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>,
 <xref rid="B142-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>,
 <xref rid="B194-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">194</xref>,
 <xref rid="B196-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">196</xref>]. Fluorescence and UV light absorption as detection signals [
 <xref rid="B53-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] are being gradually replaced by tandem mass spectrometry (e.g., [
 <xref rid="B104-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>,
 <xref rid="B196-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">196</xref>,
 <xref rid="B197-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">197</xref>]). A comprehensive HPLC-MS/MS method covering all major lignans of sesame has not been developed yet. Electrochemical methods for sesame lignans have recently been established. For instance, voltametric methods for the determination of sesamol directly in sesame oil [
 <xref rid="B198-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">198</xref>] and in acidic solutions [
 <xref rid="B199-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">199</xref>] were described. Whether these methods can compete with HPLC-MS/MS in routine analysis remains to be seen.
