<p>After chromatography became widely available as an analytical method, colorimetric methods became obsolete [

In spite of that, the Villavecchia test was used until recently for the estimation of the content of sesame oil in pharmaceuticals because it allowed for a high throughput. Even the Budowski/Suarez test was occasionally used for the determination of sesamol in oil until recently [
