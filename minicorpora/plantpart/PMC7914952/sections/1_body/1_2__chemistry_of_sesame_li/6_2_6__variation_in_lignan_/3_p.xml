<p>Comparison of lignan content in 43 varieties of sesame from all climatic zones in India showed that the content of sesamin and sesamolin was higher in black seeds than in white and brown ones [

 <xref rid="B94-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. In Chinese varieties of sesame, lignan content was higher in white seeds than in black ones [
 <xref rid="B60-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Thus, it appears that seed color and lignan content in sesame are unrelated; the associations reported in some studies may be due to limited genetic diversity in the germplasm collections used.
