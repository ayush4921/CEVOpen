<p>All furofuran lignans in sesame originate from the same pathway, therefore their concentrations are supposed to correlate. Within a set of 65 varieties developed by the sesame breeding company Sesaco Corporation, which included varieties with white, yellow, brown and black seeds, strong positive correlations were established between the content of sesamin and sesamolin (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.69), as well as sesaminol and sesamolinol (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.53) [
 <xref rid="B101-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. Interestingly, correlations between sesamin and sesaminol, sesamin and sesamolinol, sesamolin and sesaminol, and sesamolin and sesamolinol were negative (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.37, 0.36, 0.35, and 0.46, respectively) [
 <xref rid="B101-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. Our results obtained with a set of 25 sesame varieties from different parts of the world have not confirmed negative correlations of sesamin with sesaminol nor sesamolin with sesaminol (unpublished data). The comparison of sesamin and sesamolin content in 21 hybrids of Thailand varieties of sesame revealed a strong positive correlation [

 <xref rid="B214-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">214</xref>] reported very tight positive correlations between sesamin and sesamolin content in 42 varieties from Asia and Latin America, covering a wide range of agronomic characteristics. The content of sesamin was significantly higher in white and brown seeds than in black seeds; no consistent trend was found for sesamolin. The correlation between the content of sesamin and sesamolin in black and brown seeds was tight (r = 0.778 and 0.903, respectively); weaker correlation between sesamin and sesamolin was found in white seeds (r = 0.386).
