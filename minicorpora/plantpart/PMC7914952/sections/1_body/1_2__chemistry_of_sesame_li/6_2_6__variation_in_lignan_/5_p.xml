<p>The relationship between the genetic relatedness of sesame accessions and their lignan production has not been investigated. It is only known that patterns of metabolic diversity in general are incongruent with the genetic relatedness in sesame [
 <xref rid="B216-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">216</xref>]. This situation is common in plants [

 <xref rid="B220-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">220</xref>] and we assume that it holds for lignans of sesame, too. Secondary metabolite production is subjected to a strong selection pressure while surveys of genetic diversity rely on neutral markers such as amplified fragment length polymorphism AFLP [
 <xref rid="B221-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">221</xref>] and microsatellites [
 <xref rid="B222-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">222</xref>]. Patterns of genetic diversity obtained with these methods cannot be used as a predictor of lignan production. Molecular markers linked to the
