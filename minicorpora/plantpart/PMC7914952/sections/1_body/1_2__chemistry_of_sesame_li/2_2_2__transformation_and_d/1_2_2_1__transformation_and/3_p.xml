<p>Yoshida and Tagaki [
 <xref rid="B126-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>] investigated the effect of temperature on the conversion of sesamolin to sesamol in sesame seeds. Essentially all sesamolin was converted to sesamol after 25 min at 250 °C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00883-f006">Figure 6</xref>). At high temperatures, sesamol dimerizes into sesamol dimer (

 <xref rid="B127-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>], but the concentration of sesamol dimer in refined oil is very low [

 <sub>3</sub>, oxidation of sesamol by oxygen lead to a mixture of complex conjugated dimers [

 <sub>3</sub>) do not occur during processing and storage of sesame oil. Realistic conditions for industrial-scale epimerization of sesamin, an apparatus, and a procedure for preparative enrichment of episesamin were protected by a patent [
