 <xref rid="B123-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]. The mechanism of these transformations has not been conclusively established. Based on their study on the conversion of sesamolin to sesaminol under anhydrous conditions catalyzed by sulfonic acid and on Fukudaâ€™s original work [
 <xref rid="B131-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>], Huang and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B132-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>] suggested a two-step mechanism. According to their hypothesis, protonated sesamolin brakes down into sesamol and oxonium ion, both of which subsequently recombine into the products. Depending on the orientation of molecules engaged in the reaction, sesaminol, its epimers, or sesamolin epimer is produced [
 <xref rid="B132-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>]. We suggest that in sesame oil highly reactive oxonium ions would react with major components of the matrix, which are present in large excess, before re-joining with sesamol. We assume that an intramolecular rearrangement of protonated sesamolin might account for the transformation; in any case, the mechanism has to be elucidated experimentally.
