<p>Cytochrome P450 oxidases in the liver of mammals transform lignans by opening and demethylating methylenedioxy-moieties, converting them to vicinal dihydroxyphenol (catechol) derivatives. These reactions were studied in liver homogenates of rats [
 <xref rid="B156-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>], in human liver microsomes, and with human liver enzymes expressed in yeast [
 <xref rid="B157-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>]. Sesamin monocatechol is eventually glucuronated and methylated [
