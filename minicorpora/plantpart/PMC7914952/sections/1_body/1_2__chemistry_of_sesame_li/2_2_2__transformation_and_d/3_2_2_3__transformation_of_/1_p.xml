 <xref rid="B153-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>]). The conversion involves four steps: deglycosylation, demethylation, dehydrogenation, and dehydroxylation. In addition, one or two reduction steps are involved, depending on the type of lignan [

 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec5dot2dot2-molecules-26-00883">Section 5.2.2</xref>), the conversion of food lignans into enteroligans by female intestinal microflora attracted research interests. Corona and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B144-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>] compared the conversion of secoisolariciresinol, lariciresinol, pinoresinol, and matairesinol from an oilseed mixture by fecal microflora of young and premenopausal women. They found that the fecal microflora of young women generated mostly enterolactone while the microflora of premenopausal women generated mostly enterodiol. The results were reported with a precision of up to six significant figures, yet the relative standard deviations of most values exceeded 100%, suggesting that the results should not be overrated.
