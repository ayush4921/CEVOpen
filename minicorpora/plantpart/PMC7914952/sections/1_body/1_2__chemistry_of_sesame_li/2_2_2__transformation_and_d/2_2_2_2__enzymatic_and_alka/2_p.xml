 <xref rid="B115-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>] reported successful hydrolysis of pinoresinol diglucoside to aglycon by a commercial β-glucosidase. Mono- and diglucoside of sesamolinol cannot be hydrolyzed by commercial β-glucosidases, probably because steric hindrance prevented enzymatic catalysis [
 <xref rid="B98-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. Glucosides of lignans other than sesamolinol were successfully hydrolyzed by glycosidases [

 <xref rid="B76-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Deglycosylation of lignan glucosides was also achieved with a mixture of glycosidases and cellulases [

 <xref rid="B135-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>]. Park and coworkers reported that the main hydrolysis product of sesaminol triglucoside in their hands was monoglucoside rather than aglycone even after prolonged treatment with a mixture of β-glucosidase and cellulase [
 <xref rid="B136-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>]. Peng and coworkers, in spite of thorough optimization of the procedure with the same combination of enzymes, achieved only a 50% yield of pure aglycone [
 <xref rid="B137-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>]. Different properties of the enzymes used in different labs may explain the contradiction; unfortunately, the sources of the enzyme have often not been reported. Gerstenmeyer and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B104-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>] reported that prolonged incubation with β-glucuronidase/arylsulphatase from 
 <italic>Helix pomatia</italic> (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) and cellulase Onozuka R-10 (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) completely hydrolysed all lignan glucosides, while treatment with cellulase alone was not sufficient.
