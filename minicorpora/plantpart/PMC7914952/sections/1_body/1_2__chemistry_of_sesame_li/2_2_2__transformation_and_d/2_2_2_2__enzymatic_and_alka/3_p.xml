<p>To overcome the limitation of commercially available glycosylases, researchers from Kiyomoto Co. in collaboration with two universities in Japan designed a smart screening strategy to identify microbial sources of a glucosidases suitable for the hydrolysis of lignan glycosides, especially sesaminol triglucoside [
 <xref rid="B138-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>]. They collected samples of decaying sesame oil cake, extracted them with chloroform, and analyzed the extract for traces of sesaminol. One of the positive samples yielded a strain of 
 <italic>Paenibacillus</italic> sp. that hydrolyzed sesaminol triglucoside. The glucosidase responsible for the reaction was purified, partial amino acid sequence of the protein was determined, and the gene was cloned and expressed in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. The recombinant enzyme hydrolyzed sesaminol triglucoside to pure aglycone. The authors applied for patent protection [

 <italic>Lactobacillus mucosae</italic>, which deglucosylated secoisolariciresinol diglucoside into secoisolariciresinol, and successfully expressed the gene in food-grade lactic bacteria for the deglycosylation of lignans in food.
