0: Molecular markers for high lignan content are not available yet, though markers for the yield and many other agronomic traits have been established [ 21, 22, 23, 24, 25].
1: Progress in the genomics of sesame [ 26, 27] and high-resolution genetic mapping [ 26, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33] raise hopes that marker-assisted selection for lignan content as well as for a desirable ratio of individual lignans and their glycosides will be possible soon.
