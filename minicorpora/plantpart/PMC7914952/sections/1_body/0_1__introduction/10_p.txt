0: The  Section 2 on lignan chemistry provides an overview of the chemical properties of lignans; their transformation and degradation during processing; the variation of lignan content in  S. indicum and related species; and the purification, analysis, and total synthesis of lignans.
1: In the  Section 3 and  Section 4 on biosynthesis and genetics, enzymes and genes of the lignan pathway are described, and published information on the inheritance of lignan content in sesame seeds is reviewed.
2: In the  Section 5, the biological activities and health-promoting properties of lignans are reviewed and their therapeutic potential is assessed.
3: In the  Section 6, biological functions of lignans in sesame plants are discussed.
4: Finally, the potential of plant breeding and biotechnology for the improvement of lignan content in sesame seeds and for the production of lignans in vitro is assessed in the  Section 7.
