<p>Several reviews of plant lignans are available [

 <xref rid="B42-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Because of their nutritional importance, information about food lignans has been collected in several databases [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. As these databases and reviews covered lignans from many plant species, space devoted to lignans of sesame was limited. In 2013, Dar and Arumugam [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] published a review entitled “Lignans of sesame: purification methods, biological activities and biosynthesis—a review” but they, too, covered lignans from many plants while the coverage of sesame was limited. A comprehensive review focusing on the lignans of sesame has been missing. This work attempts to review chemical, biological, and applied aspects of sesame lignans comprehensively. The literature was surveyed from the first reports on sesame lignans in the 1890th, including scarcely accessible historical texts. Representative examples were selected for finding documented in many reports. Controversial issues were critically examined, and several errors perpetuated in literature were corrected.
