<p>The 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2-molecules-26-00883">Section 2</xref> on lignan chemistry provides an overview of the chemical properties of lignans; their transformation and degradation during processing; the variation of lignan content in 
 <italic>S. indicum</italic> and related species; and the purification, analysis, and total synthesis of lignans. In the 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3-molecules-26-00883">Section 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec4-molecules-26-00883">Section 4</xref> on biosynthesis and genetics, enzymes and genes of the lignan pathway are described, and published information on the inheritance of lignan content in sesame seeds is reviewed. In the 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec5-molecules-26-00883">Section 5</xref>, the biological activities and health-promoting properties of lignans are reviewed and their therapeutic potential is assessed. In the 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec6-molecules-26-00883">Section 6</xref>, biological functions of lignans in sesame plants are discussed. Finally, the potential of plant breeding and biotechnology for the improvement of lignan content in sesame seeds and for the production of lignans in vitro is assessed in the 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec7-molecules-26-00883">Section 7</xref>.
