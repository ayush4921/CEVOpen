0: Sesame ( Sesamum indicum L.) is an ancient oilseed crop [ 1] cultivated in subtropical and tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and South America as a source of edible seeds and high-quality oil.
1: The origin of cultivated sesame has not been conclusively identified [ 2].
2: Although Africa hosts most wild relatives of cultivated sesame, genetic arguments support the Indian origin of  Sesamum indicum [ 3].
3: The Indian species  S. malabaricum (syn.
4: S. mulayanum) is the most likely progenitor ([ 3] and the references therein).
5: To unite the crop and its progenitor under a common species name, Bedigian suggested new combinations  S. indicum subsp.
6: malabaricum for  S. malabaricum and  S. indicum subsp.
7: indicum for the cultivated sesame [ 4].
8: In addition to  Sesamum indicum, other species of  Sesamum and a close relative  Ceratotheca sesamoides are grown in Africa for seeds, and their leaves are locally used as vegetables [ 3].
9: Only  Sesamum indicum (syn.
10: S. indicum subsp.
11: indicum), however, is regarded as a domesticated crop, and only seeds and oil of this species are traded internationally.
