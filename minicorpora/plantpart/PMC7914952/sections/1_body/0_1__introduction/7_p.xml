<p>Lignans are metabolites formed from two molecules of phenylpropanoids. In sesame, the synthesis of lignans involves the fusion of oxopropane side chains of cinnamyl alcohol into a furofuran core (3,7-dioxabicyclo[3.3.0.]octane) (

 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3dot1-molecules-26-00883">Section 3.1</xref>). Some of these enzymes catalyze multiple steps of the pathway. The genes encoding further enzymes, such as the dirigent protein involved in the initial step of the pathway and enzymes related to the formation of lignans that do not belong to the furofuran group (e.g., lariciresinol, secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol), were putatively identified in the genome of sesame based on sequence similarity.
