<p>Sesame (
 <italic>Sesamum indicum</italic> L.) is an ancient oilseed crop [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] cultivated in subtropical and tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and South America as a source of edible seeds and high-quality oil. The origin of cultivated sesame has not been conclusively identified [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Although Africa hosts most wild relatives of cultivated sesame, genetic arguments support the Indian origin of 
 <italic>Sesamum indicum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The Indian species 
 <italic>S. malabaricum</italic> (syn. 
 <italic>S. mulayanum</italic>) is the most likely progenitor ([
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and the references therein). To unite the crop and its progenitor under a common species name, Bedigian suggested new combinations 
 <italic>S. indicum</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>malabaricum</italic> for 
 <italic>S. malabaricum</italic> and 
 <italic>S. indicum</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>indicum</italic> for the cultivated sesame [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In addition to 
 <italic>Sesamum indicum</italic>, other species of 
 <italic>Sesamum</italic> and a close relative 
 <italic>Ceratotheca sesamoides</italic> are grown in Africa for seeds, and their leaves are locally used as vegetables [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Only 
 <italic>Sesamum indicum</italic> (syn. 
 <italic>S. indicum</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>indicum</italic>), however, is regarded as a domesticated crop, and only seeds and oil of this species are traded internationally.
