0: Oil of  S. indicum is valued for its sensory characteristics and resistance to rancidity [ 2, 7, 8].
1: Sesame oil also exerts antioxidative activity and possesses health-promoting properties, which are attributed to tocopherols, tocotrienols, and lignans [ 9, 10, 11].
2: Major lignans of sesame are sesamin and sesamolin ( Figure 1).
3: The total content of these two lignans in sesame seeds may exceed 1.4% ( Table 1).
4: Numerous minor lignans present in seeds in low concentrations and/or generated by chemical transformations during seed and oil processing have been described.
5: Among them, sesamol, episesamin and samin ( Figure 2) were studied extensively.
6: Sesamol is a degradation product that is present in traces in unroasted seeds but occurs at high concentrations in roasted seeds and processed sesame oil (see  Section 2.2).
