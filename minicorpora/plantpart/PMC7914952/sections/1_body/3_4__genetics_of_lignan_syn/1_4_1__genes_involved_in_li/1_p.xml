<p>The genome of sesame (2n = 26) is composed of 16 linkage groups (LGs). The first two genomes of sesame were sequenced in 2013 [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and 2014 [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Since then, many genomes of 
 <italic>S. indicum</italic> have been sequenced. In large-scale effort to associate agronomic traits with genetic variations, genomes of 705 sesame accessions were re-sequenced [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The assembly obtained in 2014 is still used as a reference genome, which is 357 Mb large and contains 27,148 predicted protein-coding genes [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].
