<p>The GC content of the exons of these genes varies from 40.6% to 53.6%. After removal of two genes with an unusually low GC content (Acc. Nos. LC199944 and LC484013), the range narrowed to 45.2â€“53.6%, which is similar to the average GC content of all protein-coding regions in the genome of sesame [

 <xref rid="B27-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The low GC content of LC199944 and LC484013 is reflected by the low effective number of codons (

 <xref rid="B272-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">272</xref>]. Why is the GC content of these two genes so low? Inspection of putative translation products reveals a high content of amino acids with AT-rich codons. For instance, the protein product of LC484013 has the highest relative content of Phe and Ile, and together with the LC199944 the highest content of Asn and Tyr, among all proteins encoded by the genes listed in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00883-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>. Therefore, protein composition, resulting from a selection pressure on enzyme function, likely accounted for the unusually low GC content of the two genes.
