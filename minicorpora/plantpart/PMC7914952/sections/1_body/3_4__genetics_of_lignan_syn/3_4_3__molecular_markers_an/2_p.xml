<p>Secondary metabolite patterns in sesame are incongruent with the genetic relatedness [
 <xref rid="B216-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">216</xref>], similarly to other plants [
 <xref rid="B218-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">218</xref>,
 <xref rid="B219-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">219</xref>]. Molecular markers are needed for the prediction of secondary metabolite production. A gene associated with sesamin and sesamolin accumulation was identified in a massive GWAS (genome-wide association study) based on full genomes of 705 sesame varieties, which lead to the identification of genes controlling oil yield [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. One of these genes, designated 
 <italic>SiNST1</italic>, also controlled lignan synthesis. Seeds of varieties carrying an 
 <italic>SiNST1</italic> allele associated with reduced content of oil, sesamin, and sesamolin, also contained more lignin. This observation was consistent with the function of a homologous gene 
 <italic>NST1</italic> in 
 <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, which controls the synthesis of secondary cell wall [
