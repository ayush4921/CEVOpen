<p>Large differences in lignan content among accessions and varieties (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot6-molecules-26-00883">Section 2.6</xref>) indicate the existence of genetic polymorphism, which can be exploited for breeding. For the improvement of sesame as functional food, it is important to understand the heritability of the content of major lignans in sesame seeds. Data on the inheritance of lignan content are limited.
