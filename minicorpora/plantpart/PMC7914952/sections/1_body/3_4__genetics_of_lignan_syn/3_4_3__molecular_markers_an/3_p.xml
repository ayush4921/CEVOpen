<p>In a study from the National Institute of Crop Science in Tsukuba, Japan [
 <xref rid="B212-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">212</xref>], F
 <sub>2</sub> populations derived from accessions with high and low lignan content showed a continuous distribution of sesamin and sesamolin levels, indicating that lignan content was controlled polygenically. The heritability of lignan content was high, hence selection of lines with a high or low lignan content was possible. In a separate study on F
 <sub>5</sub> and F
 <sub>6</sub> recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from a cross between an accession with high lignan content and a sesamolin deficient accession, Yamamoto [
 <xref rid="B276-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">276</xref>] showed that the content of sesamin and the sum of sesamin, sesamolin and sesaminol triglucoside were inherited as polygenic traits. In contrast, the content of sesamolin and sesaminol triglucoside were controlled by a single gene and several genes, respectively. A dense set of molecular markers was developed for F
 <sub>6</sub> RILs originating from a cross between parents with contrasting metabolic profiles [

 <xref rid="B277-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">277</xref>]. The inheritance and general combining ability (GCA) of sesamin and sesamolin content were investigated at Kalasin University, Thailand [
 <xref rid="B185-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">185</xref>]. Not surprisingly, the inheritance of sesamin and sesamolin content exhibited high combining ability, with both additive and dominant effects controlling the lignan content. Positive correlation between the content of different furofuran lignans (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot6-molecules-26-00883">Section 2.6</xref>) indicates that the rise of the content of any lignan will likely lead to an increase of the content of the other lignans. Breeding efforts to enhance lignan content in sesame were recently reported from India [
 <xref rid="B213-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">213</xref>]. The authors confirmed a high general combining ability of sesamin and sesamolin content. Unfortunately, high-content parents were only crossed with a low-content tester but not with each other; therefore, none of the progeny reached the lignan levels of the best parents. With systematic efforts targeting lignans just starting, breeding for lignan content in sesame is in its infancy.
