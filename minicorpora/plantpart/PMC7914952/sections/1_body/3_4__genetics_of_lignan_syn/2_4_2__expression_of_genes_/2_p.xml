<p>Wei and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] showed that genes related to oil biosynthesis in sesame seeds were strongly associated with sesamin and sesamolin content. For example, a single nucleotide polymorphism within the gene 
 <italic>SiNST1</italic> (SIN_1005755, NCBI geneID = LOC105173057) defined two alleles, “A” and “C”. The “A” allele was associated with a low content of oil and protein and also with a low content of sesamin and sesamolin, but with a high content of lignin and an accumulation of woody tissue in seeds. The “C” allele was associated with a higher content of oil, protein, sesamin and sesamolin, but with a low content of lignin. The gene was strongly expressed in young seeds [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In our work, the gene was expressed in mature seeds to a higher level than in young seeds (Andargie, Vinas and Karlovsky, unpublished data).
