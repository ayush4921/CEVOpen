<p>Recently, it was shown that sesamin binds steroleosin B, a membrane protein found in oil bodies of sesame seedlings [

 <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> accumulating sesamin and steroleosin B due to the expression of sesame synthase and steroleosin B genes from sesame displayed severe growth defects, indicating that the complex of steroldeosin B and sesamin might interact with signal transduction pathways controlling plant development (see
