<p>In line with the focus of lignan research in sesame on the seeds, expression of the lignan pathway in sesame was studied nearly exclusively in seeds. In 2006, Ono and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B85-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>] in their characterization of piperitol/sesamin synthase reported that the gene (designated CYP81Q1, see 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00883-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00883-f009">Figure 9</xref>) was expressed in maturing seeds and in leaves but not in leaf petioles or stems. They have not found sesamin or any other lignan in the leaves. The homologue of CYP81Q1 in 
 <italic>Sesamum radiatum</italic>, designated CYP81Q2, was expressed only in seeds [
 <xref rid="B85-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. The expression of CYP81Q1 in the leaves of 
 <italic>S. indicum</italic> was confirmed by Hata and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B232-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">232</xref>], who also detected sesamin in the leaves for the first time. Comparison of two varieties of sesame revealed large differences in the expression of CYP81Q1 and the content of sesamin in the leaves. Expression of CYP81Q1 at a very low level was also detected in the stems of young plants, though no sesamin was detected in these samples [
 <xref rid="B232-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">232</xref>]. Continuous light for two weeks dramatically increased the expression of 
 <italic>CYP81Q1</italic> in the leaves of sesame, resulting in increased accumulation of lignans in leaves [
 <xref rid="B274-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">274</xref>]. This finding could be exploited for the commercial production of sesamin from the waste left after threshing, especially if lignan content in seeds can be increased genetically (see
