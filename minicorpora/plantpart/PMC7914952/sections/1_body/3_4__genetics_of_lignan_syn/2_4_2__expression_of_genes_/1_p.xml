<p>Most studies of the expression of lignans pathway in sesame used seeds of different maturity. For example, the expression of the genes encoding putative dirigent protein (NCBI geneID = LOC105164033) and for piperitol/sesamin synthase (
 <italic>CYP81Q1)</italic> was higher in early-mid than in late developmental stages of the seeds (10-20 days post-anthesis) [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The expression profile of the 
 <italic>CYP92B14</italic> gene coincided with that of 
 <italic>CYP81Q1</italic>, suggesting a catalytic cooperation between both enzymes, as demonstrated by Murata et al. [
 <xref rid="B246-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">246</xref>]. These authors also expressed 
 <italic>CYP81Q1</italic>, 
 <italic>CYP92B14,</italic> and 
 <italic>CPR1</italic> simultaneously in a yeast heterologous system. Using (+)-sesamin as a substrate, high amounts of (+)-sesaminol and (+)-sesamolin were produced in the heterologous system expressing only 
 <italic>CYP92B14</italic> and 
 <italic>CPR1</italic>. CYP81Q1 or CYP92B14 alone did not show any catalytic activity. The gene 
 <italic>CPR1</italic>, needed for the enzymatic activity of CYP81Q1, is expressed throughout the entire seed development [
