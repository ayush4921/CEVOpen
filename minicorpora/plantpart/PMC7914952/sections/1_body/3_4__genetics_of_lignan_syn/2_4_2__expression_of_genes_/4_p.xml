<p>Our own gene expression experiments with young and mature seeds of sesame corroborated that the genes involved in lignan biosynthesis, i.e., 
 <italic>CYP81Q1</italic> catalyzing the synthesis of (+)-sesamin, and 
 <italic>CYP92B14</italic> catalyzing the synthesis of (+)-sesaminol and (+)-sesamolin, were expressed to higher levels in young seeds than in mature seeds. In contrast, the gene SiNST1, which apparently affects partition of phenylpropanoids into lignans and monolignols (see above), was stronger expressed in mature seeds. Similarly, we found that the gene putatively involved in the conversion of secoisolariciresinol into matairesinol (NCBI geneID of LOC105174016) was expressed in mature seeds to a higher level than in young seeds (Andargie, Vinas and Karlovsky, unpublished data). The activation of lignan synthesis at later phases of seed development is also supported by the report that lignans were absent from young seeds of sesame [
