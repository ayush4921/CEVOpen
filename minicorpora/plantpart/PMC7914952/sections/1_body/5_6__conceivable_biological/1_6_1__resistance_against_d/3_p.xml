<p>Some lignans were reported to inhibit dimorphic yeasts and zygomycetous, ascomycetous and basidiomycetous fungi including plant pathogens (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec5dot3-molecules-26-00883">Section 5.3</xref>), but except for dimorphic yeasts, the MIC values were too high to indicate a defense function. The observation that low concentrations of pinoresinol inhibited the synthesis of trichothecenes in 
 <italic>F. graminearum</italic> is interesting because trichothecenes are virulence factors facilitating colonization of the host plant; however, 
 <italic>F. graminearum</italic> does not infect sesame. Taken together, the available data do not support the hypothesis that lignans in sesame are resistance factors protecting plants from microbial pathogens.
