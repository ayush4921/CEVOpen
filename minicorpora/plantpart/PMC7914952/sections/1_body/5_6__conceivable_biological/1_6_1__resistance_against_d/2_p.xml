<p>We are aware of only one report indicating that lignans biosynthesis was involved in plant defense against a pathogen: infection of cotton with 
 <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> stimulated the transcription of genes involved in lignan biosynthesis [
 <xref rid="B400-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">400</xref>]. Extracts of several tissues of sesame inhibited the growth of fungal pathogens of sesame [
 <xref rid="B401-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">401</xref>], but the chemical composition of the extracts was not examined. The results obtained in other plants do not support a role of lignans in disease resistance. In flax, silencing the cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase, which shifted more cinnamyl alcohol to the synthesis of lignans while reducing the content of lignin, slightly decreased the resistance of flax to its major pathogen 
 <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B402-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">402</xref>]. Similarly, silencing cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase in poplar did not affect the colonization with mycorrhiza [
 <xref rid="B403-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">403</xref>]. Infection of poplar with fungal pathogens actually induced the synthesis of cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase, which diverts the substrate from lignans to monolignols and lignin [
 <xref rid="B404-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">404</xref>]. Likewise, elicitation of flax cell culture with fungal pathogens did not increase lignan levels in the cells [
