<p>For a long time, sesame oil has been known to increase the efficacy of certain insecticides (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec5dot4-molecules-26-00883">Section 5.4</xref>). Insecticidal and antifeedant activities of purified sesame lignans and compounds similar to lignans indicate that lignans of sesame might contribute to the protection of seeds against herbivores. Older literature on antifeedant activities of lignans was reviewed by Harmatha and Dinan [
 <xref rid="B406-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">406</xref>]. Insecticidal activity was demonstrated for furofuran lignans from Himalayan shrub

 <xref rid="B408-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">408</xref>]. Pinoresinol secreted by glandular hairs on the back of the larvae deterred ants, and pinoresinol-treated flies lost their attractiveness as food for ants.
