<p>Another indication that lignans may be involved in plant defense against herbivores is the induction of lignan biosynthetic pathway by methyl jasmonate [
 <xref rid="B409-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">409</xref>], which is a phytohormone triggering plant defense against insects [
 <xref rid="B410-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">410</xref>]. These results and antifeedant activity of lignans observed in vitro corroborate the hypothesis that lignans protect sesame seeds from herbivores. The results obtained in vitro should, however, not be overrated. Experiences from other systems show that insecticidal activities of natural products observed in vitro may misguide research into a wrong direction for decades [
