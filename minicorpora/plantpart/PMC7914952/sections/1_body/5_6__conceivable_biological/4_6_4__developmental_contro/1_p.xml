<p>The last potential biological function of lignans is the most speculative: sesamin might be linked to plant development. A recent report [
 <xref rid="B273-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">273</xref>] showed that sesamin and sesamin-binding protein steroleosin B from sesame seeds caused various developmental defects when concomitantly produced in genetically engineered 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic> plants [
 <xref rid="B273-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">273</xref>]. If steroleosin B and sesamin are involved in the developmental control in sesame, they must exert their function in seeds, because steroleosin B is produced in seeds and during germination [
 <xref rid="B273-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">273</xref>] while sesamin accumulates to high level in mature seeds but disappears immediatly after germination (

 <xref rid="B85-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]). These results are especially interesting in the light of a previous report that sesamin and sesamolin, depending on the enantiomer and concentration, stimulated or inhibited the growth of lettuce and ryegrass [

 <italic>Sesamum</italic> sp. with genetically manipulated biosynthetic pathways for lignans. This sort of a proof is a standard requirement for the demonstration of biological functions of secondary metabolites in fungi (e.g., [

 <xref rid="B415-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">415</xref>]). Time is mature to apply the same scrutiny to the elucidation of biological functions of plant secondary metabolites. In sesame, the technology is ready (see
