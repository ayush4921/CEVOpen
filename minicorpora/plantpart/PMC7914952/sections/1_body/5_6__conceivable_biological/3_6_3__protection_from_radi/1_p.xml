<p>UV light induced the synthesis of plant metabolites protecting the plant from radiation damage [

 <xref rid="B274-molecules-26-00883" ref-type="bibr">274</xref>]. In this context, it might be interesting to determine the effect of UV light on the content of sesamin in sesame leaves. The low content of sesamin in the leaves, however, and the absence of lignans from all other organs except seeds and roots (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot7-molecules-26-00883">Section 2.7</xref>) render the role of lignans in the protection of plants against UV damage unlikely.
