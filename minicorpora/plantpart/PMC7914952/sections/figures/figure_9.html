 <caption> Lignan biosynthetic pathway in Sesamum indicum. 1 = laccase, 2 = dirigent protein, 3 = piperitol/sesamin synthase (CYP81Q1), 4 = sesamolin/sesaminol synthase (CYP92B14), 5 = UGT71A9, 6 = UGT94AG1, 7 = UGT94D1/UGT94AA2. Identified and postulated conversions are represented by solid and broken lines, respectively. The sequential conversion from pinoresinol to secoisolariciresinol and to matairesinol is proposed in sesame based on Forsythia intermedia biosynthetic pathway [ 244, 245]. The convertion of sesamin to 7â€²-episesantalin has been recently proposed to occur in S. radiatum [ 92]. </caption>
