 <italic>Psidium myrtoides</italic> oil presented the highest yields in the dry season (0.96–1.02%), decreasing in the rainy seasons (0.36–0.48%). A negative correlation between the oil yield and rainfall was noted. November presented the higher oil content (0.27 mL/100 g, fresh leaves), suggesting an excellent harvesting time. The oxygenated constituents (mono- and sesquiterpenes) decreased from May (OM: 7.01%; OS: 39.0%) to November (OM: 0%; OS: 21.0%), while the sesquiterpene hydrocarbons increased at the same time (May: 40.0%; November: 70.5%). The most predominant constituents in these two seasons were 1,8-cineole (29.5–48.1%), α-eudesmol (11.7–20.0%), α-pinene (5.0–12.8%), elemol (3.3–6.7%), and γ-eudesmol (2.5–5.8%). Lower content to 1,8-cineole occurred in March, during the ripening process of
