 <italic>Psidium</italic> species have great ecological relevance. Their fruits are usually fleshly and sought after by several animals, such as birds and mammals, and used as a food source. Thus, this ecological relationship has promoted the conservation of genus diversity since the animals act as seed dispersing agents [

 <italic>Psidium</italic> species can adapt to constant abiotic stress [
