0: Psidium species have great ecological relevance.
1: Their fruits are usually fleshly and sought after by several animals, such as birds and mammals, and used as a food source.
2: Thus, this ecological relationship has promoted the conservation of genus diversity since the animals act as seed dispersing agents [ 5].
3: Moreover,  Psidium species can adapt to constant abiotic stress [ 6], contributing to broad diversification and species geographical distribution [ 7].
