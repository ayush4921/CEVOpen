<p>Five 
 <italic>Psidium salutare</italic> leaf oil records were classified into 4 chemical profiles. Constituents characterized the first profile from Uruguay with 
 <italic>p</italic>-menthane and acyclic skeletons, as 1,8-cineole (31.2–36.6%), linalool (11.5–12.38%), and α-terpineol (6.7–7.0%) [
 <xref rid="B96-molecules-26-00965" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. The second profile from Northeast Brazil was rich in compounds with 
 <italic>p</italic>-methane and germacrane skeletons, as 1,8-cineole (63.3%), 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (14.1%), α-terpinyl acetate (7.2%), and β-eudesmol (8.8%) [

 <xref rid="B97-molecules-26-00965" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. The third profile also from Northeast Brazil showed 
 <italic>p</italic>-menthane, cadinane and acyclic skeleton types, as 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (5.1–17.8%), terpinolene (6.9–17.0%), γ-terpinene (10.3–17.1%), 
 <italic>epi</italic>-α-cadinol (10.4–12.8%), linalool (4.7–7.3%), and δ-cadinene (3.8–5.3%) with a change of its constituents according to the seasons [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-26-00965" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The fourth profile from Cuba was dominated by caryophyllane, bisabolane, germacrane, and pinane skeleton types, as caryophyllene oxide (39.8%), 
 <italic>ar</italic>-turmerone (17.3%), β-gurjunene (6.7%), β-selinene (6.0%), and α-pinene (5.6%) [
