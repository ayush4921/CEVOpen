<p>Two 
 <italic>P. sartorianum</italic> leaves oil records from Cuba and Mexico showed differences in their chemical compositions. The Cuba oil showed 
 <italic>p</italic>-menthane (limonene 43.0%) and pinane (α-pinene 39.5% and β-pinene 5.6%) skeleton types [

 <italic>p</italic>-menthane (α-phellandrene 9.8%), and acyclic (
