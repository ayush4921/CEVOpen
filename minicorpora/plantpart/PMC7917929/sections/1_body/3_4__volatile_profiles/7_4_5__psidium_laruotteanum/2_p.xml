<p>Regarding the chemical variability of leaves essential oils of 
 <italic>Psidium laruotteanum</italic>, the records from Midwest Brazil were classified into three chemical profiles, rich in monoterpenes with 
 <italic>p</italic>-menthane and pinane skeletons. Profile I was rich in 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (24.8%), 1,8-cineole (19.2%), α-pinene (13.4%), and terpinen-4-ol (6.3%) [

 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (19.4%), α-pinene (11.6%), 1,8-cineole (6.9%), terpinen-4-ol (5.8%), and followed also by γ-terpinene (14.0%), limonene (10.2%), and terpinolene (5.1%) [

 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (34.8%), 1,8-cineole (12.5%), α-pinene (9.2%), limonene (7.9%), γ-terpinene (6.9%), and α-terpineol (6.0%), as primary constituents [
 <xref rid="B86-molecules-26-00965" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. The three chemical profiles showed quantitative and qualitative variability, probably due to the specimens being collected in the wild and not subjected to the same conditions of environmental control, except in their vegetative stages, without flowers and fruits.
