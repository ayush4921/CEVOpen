<p>Four EOs from 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> from Spain were analyzed by Cutillas et al. [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-25-05826" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] for their antioxidant activity against free radicals as well as ferric reducing and ferrous chelating agents. In the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) and ABTS test, EO showed a range of activity of 98.8–154.9 and 0.6–1.2 mg Trolox equivalent/g EO, respectively. In DPPH test, all EOs presented a value of 0.1 mg TE/g EO. In thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) test, a range of 0.5–1.2 mg butylhydroxytoluene equivalent/g EO was reported. A similar value was observed for their capacity to reduce ferric ions and chelating activity.
