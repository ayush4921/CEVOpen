<p>An antioxidant activity in a concentration-dependent manner was found for all EOs. Except for FRAP test, S3 oil showed the best antioxidant activity. Indeed, S2 sample exhibited the highest radical potential with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 20.64 μg/mL in ABTS test and a percentage of 35.33% in DPPH test. Additionally, this EO presented the highest protection of lipid peroxidation with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 38.06 and 46.32 μg/mL after 30 and 60 min of incubation, respectively. In iron reduction capacity, S1 was the most active. Significant correlations (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-05826">Table S2</xref>) were found between α-pinene content and DPPH test (r = 1.00). A positive correlation between myrcene and β-pinene content and ABTS test (r = 1.00 and 0.99, respectively) was also found. In addition, the Pearson’s correlation coefficient was positive between calarene, manoyl oxide, and manool and β-carotene blanching test after 30 min of incubation with r = 1.00, and 0.99, respectively. Moreover, caryophyllene oxide and terpinene-4-ol were positively correlated with β-carotene blanching test after 60 min of incubation (r = 0.99 and 0.98, respectively). In FRAP test, the higher positive correlation was found with γ-terpinene (r = 0.99).
