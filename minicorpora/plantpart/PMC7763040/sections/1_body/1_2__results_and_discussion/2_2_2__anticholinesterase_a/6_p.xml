<p>A less activity was reported for 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> EO from Colombia that showed an anti-AChE activity with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 78 mg/L [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-25-05826" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and much lower IC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranging between 326.7 and 867.4 mg/L were found by Cutillas et al. [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-25-05826" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] for four Spanish 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> EOs. Previously, Albano et al. [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-25-05826" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] reported more interesting results against AChE (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 50.8 mg/L) than that reported by Orhan et al. [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-25-05826" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] (63.8% at a concentration 1 mg/mL) and by Ferreira et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-25-05826" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] (46% of inhibition at a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL) for 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> essential oils collected in Portugal.
