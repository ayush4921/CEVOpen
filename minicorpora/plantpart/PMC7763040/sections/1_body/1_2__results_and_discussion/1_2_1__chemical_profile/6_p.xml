<p>In the context of the 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> variability, principal component analysis (PCA) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05826-f002">Figure 2</xref>) showed on the first (31.23% of variation) and second (18.29%) principal components four more or less distinct groups. Croatian populations (CR) showed a clear separation on the left part of the scatterplot, because of a higher content in β-thujone (µ = 15.67 ± 13.28; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), and β-pinene (µ = 5.39 ± 3.087; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) with respect to all other samples.
