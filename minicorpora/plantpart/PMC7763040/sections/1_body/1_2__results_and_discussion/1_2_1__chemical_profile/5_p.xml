<p>Interestingly, in S2 oil, the β-pinene content was about three times higher than that found in S1 and S3. The same observation can be done for myrcene that showed a percentage higher in S2 than in S1 and S3. In S1 essential oil, the α-thujone content was about eight times higher in comparison to its content in S2. β-Cubebene and α-bergamotene are identified only in S2, while some compounds such as α-copaene, β-bourbonene, α-gurjunene, β-selinene, germacrene D spathulenol, and calarene were not identified in this essential oil. These results confirmed that the different EOs composition is subject to change under the influence of several factors including collection time, environmental factors, and climatic conditions [
