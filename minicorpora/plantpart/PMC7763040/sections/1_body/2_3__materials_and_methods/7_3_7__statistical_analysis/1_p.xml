<p>Experiments were carried out in triplicate. Data are reported as means ± standard deviation (S.D.). The concentration giving 50% inhibition (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) was calculated by nonlinear regression with the use of Prism GraphPad Prism version 4.0 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Data were statistically analyzed using one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s post hoc test for multiple comparisons with control and Tukey’s test to determine any significant difference on chemical parameters. Differences were considered to be significant at
