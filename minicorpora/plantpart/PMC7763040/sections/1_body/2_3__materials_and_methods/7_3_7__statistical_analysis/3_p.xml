<p>Literature data on EOs composition of natural populations of 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-05826">Supplementary Materials, Table S1</xref>) were collected and organized in a 120 variables (compounds) per 112 cases (plant samples) matrix. Average value (µ) and standard deviation were reported, when opportune. The most representative EO (detected in over 90% of cases) were selected and tested under normality (Shapiro–Wilk). EOs that did not fit the test (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) were log transformed (Ln (x + 1)) and tested again under normality and, when the test was not fitted, distance from normality was checked; EOs with skewness over 1 were excluded. Variables were standardized (z-score) and principal component analysis (PCA) was performed. The first and the second component were considered and cases were grouped based on the minimal spanning tree (Euclidean distance). EOs were subject to univariate analysis (
 <italic>t</italic>-test and F-test) to check differences in essential oil content among groups; probability test (P) was reported. Statistical analyses were performed using PAST 4.1 software (Copyright Hammer &amp; Harper; free download from:
