0: AD therapy is commonly based on inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), the enzyme responsible to the hydrolysis of acetylcholine in several cholinergic pathways in the central and peripheral nervous systems.
1: However, it was found that AChE activity remains unchanged or declines, whereas butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activity progressively increases.
2: Both enzymes, which differ in kinetics, substrate specificity, and activity in different brain regions, represent a useful therapeutic target for improving the cholinergic deficit responsible for the decline of cognitive and behavioral characteristics of AD.
3: Additionally, the amyloid peptides, contained in the senile plaques, can induce inflammation in which reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced [ 11].
4: ROS are able to damage cellular constituents and act as secondary messenger in inflammation.
5: For these reasons, the use of compounds able of restoring the level of acetylcholine through inhibition of the AChE and BChE enzymes, eliminating ROS, and attenuating inflammatory pathways can be a multitarget strategy for the treatment and management of AD [ 11, 17].
6: Several studies reported a number of new cholinesterase inhibitors isolated from medicinal plants and plant foods.
