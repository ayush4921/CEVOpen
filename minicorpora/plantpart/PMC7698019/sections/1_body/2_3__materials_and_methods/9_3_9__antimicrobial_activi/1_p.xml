<p>The microbes which were originated from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and the Center of Industrial Microorganisms Collection of the Institute of Fermentation Technology and Microbiology, Lodz University of Technology, Poland, WDCM 105 (LOCK) were examined. Strains tested were both Gram-positive (
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> ATCC 6633, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> ATCC 6538) and Gram-negative bacteria (
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> ATCC 8739, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> ATCC 15442), as well as fungi (the yeast 
 <italic>Candida vini</italic> LOCK 0008, the moulds 
 <italic>Penicillium expansum</italic> LOCK 0535, 
 <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> LOCK 16404). Microbial strains were sub-cultured on the medium plate count agar (PCA, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) for bacteria or potato dextrose agar medium (PDA, BTL, Warsaw, Poland) for fungi, and next, activated through double passaging in Tripticase Soy Broth (TSB, Biocorp, Warsaw, Poland) for bacteria or Sabouraud Dextrose Broth (SDB, BTL, Warsaw, Poland) for fungi. Conditions of incubation were 30 °C (
 <italic>E. coli, B. subtilis</italic>), 37 °C (
 <italic>S. aureus, P. aeruginosa</italic>) for 24h, and 25 °C for 72 h for fungi. Inoculum of 24-h cultures of each strain was prepared in standard 0.85% sodium chloride solution and adjusted to the final concentration of approximately 107 CFU/mL.
