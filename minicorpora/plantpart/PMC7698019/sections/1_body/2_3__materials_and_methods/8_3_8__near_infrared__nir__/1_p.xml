<p>Oil samples were scanned in the infrared spectrometer Nicolet iS50 FT-IR (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) that allows to generate spectra in two ranges: MIR and NIR. MIR analyses were carried out with a DTGS KBr detector, IR light source, and KBr beamsplitter. The range of scans was from 4000 to 400 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> with a resolution of 4.00 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. The samples were placed in IR Sample Cards (Real Crystal, US) with KBr glass (9.5 mm aperture) and all spectra were accumulated from 32 scans. During NIR measurements there were used: InGaAs detector, white light, and CaF
 <sub>2</sub> beamsplitter. The range of scans was from 12,000–4400 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> with a resolution of 8.00 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. All spectra were accumulated from 32 scans. The samples were placed in the middle of the borosilicate glass tubes (6 × 50 mm) made by Kimble Glass, US. All calculations were made using a commercial analysis software: OMNIC 9.3.30 and TQ Analyst, v. 9.4.45 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).
