<p>The essential oil from sonicated celery seeds possessed moderate activity against all tested microorganisms (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05322-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The study demonstrated that the oil had a high antimicrobial effect against food-borne pathogens 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. The limonene, pinene (-α, -β), and selinene (-α, -β) are responsible for the biological activity of celery seeds oil [

 <xref rid="B18-molecules-25-05322" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The essential oils with a high limonene content like an orange essential oil (
 <italic>Citrus aurantium dulcis</italic>), a Tahiti lime essential oil (
 <italic>Citrus limonum</italic>), or a caraway essential oil (
 <italic>Carum carvi</italic>) inhibited the growth of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> with MIC
 <sub>90%</sub> values of 16.5, 14.9 mg/mL, and 1.0 μL/mL, respectively [

 <xref rid="B20-molecules-25-05322" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Due to virulence and high antimicrobial resistance, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> is a common cause of infections and is a serious problem in clinical medicine. Other tested bacteria strains exhibited moderate sensitiveness with MIC values between 10 and 30 μL/mL. Yeast 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> were more sensitive than moulds and its growth had been inhibited in a concentration of 30 μL/mL. According to Thakre et al. (2018), limonene has destructive effects on the yeast cell surface, thereby resulting in the induction of apoptosis and strongly inhibits 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> growth [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-25-05322" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Furthermore, Ünal et al. (2012) indicated that limonene (10 µL) exhibited a higher antifungal activity than antibiotic Fungizone (50 µL) against 12 strains of tested yeast [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-25-05322" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Celery seed essential oil has been found to exhibit a strong inhibitory effect against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and good activity against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa, B. subtilis</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> [
