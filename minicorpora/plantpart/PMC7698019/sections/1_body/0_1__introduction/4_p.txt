0: To maximize the process efficiency, the experiment was planned according to a design of experiment (DOE) approach with the use of the Taguchi method to optimize parameters of the seeds sonication process for savings in time and energy consumption.
1: The qualitative and quantitative composition, physicochemical parameters, biological activity, and aroma profile of the essential oil obtained from raw material sonicated in optimal parameters were analyzed.
