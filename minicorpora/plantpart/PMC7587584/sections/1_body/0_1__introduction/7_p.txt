0: The decision on the extraction method employed is influenced by the chemical nature of the substance, sample particle size and by the presence of interfering substances.
1: Extraction time, temperature, solvent-to-feed ratio, the number of repeated extractions of the sample and the choice of extraction solvents are the crucial parameters affecting the solubility, and consequently the yield, of the compound of interest.
2: Phenolic compounds can be extracted from fresh, frozen or dried plant samples.
