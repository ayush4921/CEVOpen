0: Traditional extraction technologies have been well established but involve the application of considerable amounts of conventional solvents, such as alcohols, acetone, diethyl ether and ethyl acetate, while also using methods that are energy intensive, time consuming and influence the total process cost [ 7].
1: In applying the principles of green chemistry, water and carbon dioxide clearly represent safer solvents.
