<p>It has been reported that the antioxidant capacity of extracts from different oregano species is somewhat dependent on the solvents used during their extraction. The antioxidant ability of extracts has been correlated with the flavonoid and phenolic acids yield during the extraction process. Greek oregano (
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic>) is the most recognized species of oregano. Methanolic extracts of 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> have shown high antioxidant capacity against DPPH, ABTS, FRAP and ORAC [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-25-04735" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], which is attributed to the high phenolic content such as rosmarinic acid, eriodictyol, naringenin and epicatechin [
 <xref rid="B76-molecules-25-04735" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Water, methanol, ethyl acetate and hexane extracts contain a high content of rosmarinic, caffeic, chicoric and 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acids. TPC, DPPH, TAC, and RP assays have been applied to confirm their antioxidant ability [
