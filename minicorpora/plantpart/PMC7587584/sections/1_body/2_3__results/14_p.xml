<p>Essential oils, in general, have shown lower antioxidant activity than artificial antioxidants even when using the essential oils in higher concentrations. Quiroga and co-workers reported that [
 <xref rid="B80-molecules-25-04735" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>] diverse chemical compositions of oregano essential oils reflected different antioxidant activities. In that research, oregano essential oil showed a higher thymol content and higher radical scavenging and antioxidant activity when added to canola oil. Namely, increasing the concentration of a particular molecule with high antioxidant potential in a fraction obtained from the essential oil should increase the antioxidant power in that fraction compared with the antioxidant activity of the essential oil. This may be contributed to the antioxidant synergy among the compounds present in both extracts. When the antioxidants are combined, antioxidant synergy occurs. Networking antioxidants can recycle one another from their radicalized forms back into their active antioxidant forms. By this process of mutual regeneration, networking antioxidants enhance and extend one anotherâ€™s capacities, working within and around the mitochondria where most of the oxidation occurs. Flavonoids and phenolic acids found in different oregano species are listed in
