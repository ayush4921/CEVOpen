<p>Recent literature reports the strong antioxidant ability of methanolic extract of the stem against the DPPH radical (96% at 200 ppm), superoxide anion radical scavenging (61% at 250 ppm) and TAC (634 µM AAE/g of extract). Subsequent HPLC analysis confirmed high amounts of rosmarinic acid, caffeic acid, rutin, gallic acid, quercetin and 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid in the examined samples. Nevertheless, as reported by Yan et al. [
 <xref rid="B77-molecules-25-04735" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>], the high content of rosmarinic acid analyzed in the hydro-extract of the leaves from 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> did probably not contribute to the high antioxidant activity determined by the TPC and ORAC assays. Phenolic content, provided as gallic acid equivalents per amount of fresh weight, varied between 79 mg and 147 mg GAE/g DW. Trolox equivalents (TE)/mg of dry weight varied between 1.59 mmol and 3.39 mmol TE/g DW. Thus, no correlation was found between the rosmarinic acid content and the antioxidant capacity measured by ORAC, which may indicate that other compounds are acting as antioxidant agents. In contrast, the study of Gonçalves et al. [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-25-04735" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] reports that the high quantity of rosmarinic acid (23.53 mg/g of dry extract) and the presence of other active compounds, including epicatechin, in the same type of extracts contributed to the high antioxidant capacity (as determined by DPPH, ABTS and FRAP). Some authors relate the antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> with the presence of rosmarinic, chicoric and caffeic acid [
