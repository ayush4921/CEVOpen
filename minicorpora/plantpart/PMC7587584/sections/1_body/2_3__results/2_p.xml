<p>The volatile aroma components from extracts were analyzed by GCâ€“MS. The GC-FID and GC-MS analysis of essential oil from oregano leaves (
 <italic>Origanum compactum</italic>) resulted in the identification of 46 compounds, representing more than 98% of the total composition. Carvacrol was the predominant compound (36.46%), followed by thymol (29.74%) and p-cymene (24.31%). Serial extractions with petroleum ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol and water performed on aerial parts of 
 <italic>Origanum compactum</italic> produced extracts with various chemical species: polyphenols (gallic acid equivalent 21.2 to 858.3 g/kg), tannins (catechin equivalent 12.4 to 510.3 g/kg), anthocyanins (cyanidin equivalent 0.38 to 5.63 mg/kg) and flavonoids (quercetin equivalent 14.5 to 54.7 g/kg) [
