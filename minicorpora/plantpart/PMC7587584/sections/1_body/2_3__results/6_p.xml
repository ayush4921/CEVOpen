<p>Indeed, antiradical activity has been found in aqueous and methanolic extracts of oregano leaves. Ethanolic extracts under selected conditions showed antioxidant activity as well. Even though a variety of flavonoids are known, there is no correlation between compositional data and antioxidant activity. The total phenolic content does not directly forecast the potent stabilization of the phenoxyl radical. The structure of different flavonoids extracted in different conditions will finally define the antioxidant activity of the extract. The number and position of hydroxyl and methoxyl groups in the benzene ring and the possibility of electron delocalization in the double bonds are the most important aspects that influence the final activity of the extracts [
