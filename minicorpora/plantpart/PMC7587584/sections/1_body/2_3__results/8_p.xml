<p>A variety of methods, classified in two major groups, is used to determine the antioxidant ability. Antioxidant activity/capacity can be monitored by assays with different mechanisms, including hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and electron transfer (ET). There are also mixed-mode (ET/HAT) assays, generally without distinct boundaries between them. The appropriate selection of technique is based on understanding the principal mechanisms and advantages and drawbacks of the assay. These considerations are important for the valid evaluation of antioxidant properties in desired applications. Among HAT assays, the oxygen radical absorbance assay (ORAC) is the most frequently used. The most recently used ET methods are: the inhibition of the 1,10-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH), the Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) method/ABTS radical cation decolorization assay (also known as ABTS assay), the ferric-reducing antioxidant power assay (FRAP), the cupric ion-reducing antioxidant capacity method (CUPRAC) and total phenolic content assay [
