<p>The MIC of Kuradin against all isolates was 48 µg/mL which is more or less similar to the value of 50 µg/mL reported for 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B55-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], but higher than a value of 20 µg/mL previously reported for different bacteria [
 <xref rid="B35-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Kuraridin, from 
 <italic>Sophora flavescens</italic>, has been previously reported as a potential antimicrobial compound [
 <xref rid="B35-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="B36-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="B56-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The MIC of emodin against 
 <italic>C. jejuni</italic> was 50 µg/mL, which is slightly lower than the 70–90 µg/mL previously reported for 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B34-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, the MIC of 200 µg/mL against 
 <italic>C. coli</italic> was higher than the reported values by Basu et al. [
 <xref rid="B34-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The literature on both kuraridin and emodin is scanty, and there are no previous findings against 
 <italic>Campylobacter</italic> species. Further studies on 
 <italic>Campylobacter</italic> strains from different sources are needed to confirm the effectiveness of both kuraridin and emodin.
