<p>The MBC values for all the strains ranged from 25–1600 µg/mL, with (E)-Cinnamaldehyde and cinnamon oil showing the lowest values (25–100 µg/mL). The MBC values for plant extracts varied between 400 and 1600 µg/mL, with 
 <italic>C. cassia</italic> showing the lowest MBC of 400 µg/mL. The MBC values for ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid varied between 64 and 256 µg/mL, while it varied between 128 and 512 µg/mL for tetracycline for the chicken isolates (

 <italic>gyr</italic>A and 
 <italic>tet</italic>(O) genes, which confirm the phenotypic results from MIC determination (

 <italic>cme</italic>B was absent in both 
 <italic>Campylobacter</italic> isolated from chicken by PCR. After sequencing PCR products, chicken isolates exhibited mutations for 
 <italic>gyr</italic>A and 
 <italic>tet</italic>(O). The Thr86Ile point mutation for 
 <italic>C. jejuni</italic> and 
 <italic>C. coli</italic>, associated with resistance to quinolones (CIP and NAL), was confirmed by the sequencing of PCR products (
