<p>For the antibiotic resistance genes (
 <italic>tet</italic>(O), 
 <italic>gyr</italic>A, and 
 <italic>cme</italic>B), m-PCR was performed using specific primers (
 <xref rid="antibiotics-09-00790-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), as previously described [
 <xref rid="B77-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>,
 <xref rid="B78-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. PCR products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis. The bands of the amplification products were compared to the Dyne 100 bp DNA ladder (Dyne bio, Seongnam, Korea). Bands of PCR products were observed and photographed with an iBrightâ„¢ CL1000 imaging system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Seoul, Korea). The purification of PCR products was performed with the Pure Link
 <sup>TM</sup> Quick PCR purification kit (Invitrogen, Vilnius, Lithuania) and sequenced by the Sanger method at SolGent (Solutions for Genetic technologies, Daejeon, Korea).
