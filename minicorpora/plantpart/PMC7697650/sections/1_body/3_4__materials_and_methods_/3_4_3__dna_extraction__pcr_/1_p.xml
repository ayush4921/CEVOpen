<p>Genomic DNA was extracted from pure colonies using the Qiagen QIAamp
 <sup>®</sup> PowerFecal
 <sup>®</sup> kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), according to the manufacturer’s instructions, followed by multiplex-PCR using genus-specific primers (C412F; C1228R)

 <xref rid="B76-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. The PCR mixture (25 μL) contained 12.5 μL of 2× Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Seoul, Korea), 1 μL of each primer, 1.5 μL of DNA, and 7 μL of sterile deionized water. The cycling conditions were one cycle of 95 °C for 5 min, 35 cycles each of 94 °C for 30 sec, 55 °C for 45 sec, and 72 °C for 45 sec, and a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min using a MiniAmp
 <sup>TM</sup> Plus thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems, MA, USA). The PCR products were held at 4 °C before analysis.
