0: There have been increased reports about high-level resistance to frontline and alternative antimicrobials, including macrolides, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, and tetracyclines, among  Campylobacter strains [ 7, 8].
1: Increased antimicrobial resistance (AMR) among pathogens has been associated with many factors, including the unrestricted use of antimicrobials in various fields [ 9, 10].
2: The main mechanisms of AMR include mutations in specific genes and acquiring efflux pumps [ 11].
3: For instance, the main resistance mechanism to ciprofloxacin is through target mutation in the DNA  gyrA gene, along with the  CmeABC efflux pump [ 4, 12]; the majority (7590%) of  Campylobacter isolates worldwide have developed resistance to this important category of antibiotics [ 13].
4: The resistance to tetracycline is known to be either on a plasmid or bacterial chromosome [ 14, 15, 16].
5: It is estimated that by the year 2050, if no adequate actions are taken, the annual death rate due to AMR would reach 10 million people worldwide and cost USD 100 trillion [ 17].
6: Poultry has been recognized as the primary reservoir of  Campylobacter strains that are resistant to fluoroquinolones associated with human diseases [ 18].
7: The progressive end of the traditional antimicrobial drug era as a result of the increasing number of AMR pathogens requires the development of new approaches to deal with AMR pathogens [ 11, 19].
