0: To improve the current trend, natural products (NPs) are good candidates in food preservation and/or drug development due to their rich composition [ 20, 21].
1: Herbal medicines, generally recognized as safe, are more widely used and more affordable than synthetic ones [ 22, 23].
2: NPs are also known to work in synergy with existing drugs to combat AMR pathogens [ 24].
3: Although the literature on the anti- Campylobacter activity of natural products is scanty,  Cinnamomum cassia (L.) J.Presl is a known traditional Chinese medicine for treating various diseases, while  Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi is effective against  Helicobacter pylori [ 25, 26], which is phylogenetically closely related to  Campylobacter [ 2].
4: Studies have shown that cinnamon oil works well against  Campylobacter species and several other pathogens [ 27, 28, 29].
5: Mentha canadensis L. proved to inhibit both  C. jejuni and  H. pylori [ 30, 31] and it is also effective in the treatment of dysentery [ 31].
6: Meehania urticifolia (Miq.)
7: Makino is known for its phenolic compounds but its antimicrobial activity is still poorly reported [ 32].
8: Clove oil and its major phytochemical eugenol are known for their antimicrobial and virulence-modulating activities against  Campylobacter species [ 28, 33].
9: Emodin has been found to inhibit  Pseudomonas aeruginosa [ 34], while kuraridin had activity against different pathogenic bacteria [ 35] and reoviruses [ 36].
10: Cinnamaldehyde has been reported to possess antimicrobial properties against various pathogens [ 37].
11: Therefore, NPs could become potential sources for ensuring the safety of food items during this period when resistance to antimicrobials and tolerance to methods used in food industries are escalating [ 38, 39].
