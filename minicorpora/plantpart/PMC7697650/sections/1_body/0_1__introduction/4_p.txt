0: It has been recognized that medicinal plants are equipped with bioactive compounds used for prophylaxis and therapeutic purposes [ 40].
1: It is estimated that 87% of populations from low- and middle-income countries rely on medicinal plants for their healthcare [ 41, 42, 43].
2: Several millions of NPs exist but only a small number of them have been explored for anti- Campylobacter activities.
3: Considering that  Campylobacter is a public health concern and one of the pathogens on the World Health Organization (WHO) list for which drug development is an emergency [ 42, 43], it is imperative to explore possible alternative solutions through the use of NPs that can be candidates for drug development.
4: With this background, the present study evaluates the susceptibility of  Campylobacter strains to selected NPs and frontline antimicrobials.
