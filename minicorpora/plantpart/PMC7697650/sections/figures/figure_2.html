 <caption> Mutations in gyrA sequences of C. jejuni ( A) and C. coli ( B). The mutation (Thr86Ile) is caused by the change from ACA to ATA ( C. jejuni) and ACT to ATT ( C. coli). Silent mutations in gyrA are also depicted. Mutations are bolded and underlined. L04566.1 and U63413.1 are standard strains (without mutation), while KX982339.1 and MT176401.1 are resistant strains. MT947448 and MT947449 are chicken isolates of this study. </caption>
