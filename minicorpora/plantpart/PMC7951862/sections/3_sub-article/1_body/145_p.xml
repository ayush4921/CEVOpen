<p>First paragraph or in R and D: what about timing of major enteric or other diseases that calves experience and timing of occurrence? Thinking about diarrhea in calves occurring mainly in first 3 wk of life and limited starter intake during this time which would support inclusion in milk if to benefit this situation. What about timing and main use of antibiotics relative to these health events? That is a main motivation for use of essential oils correct?</p>
