<p>Studies focusing on essential oils’ action as growth promotors for pigs and poultry show the supplementation’s positive effects, generally associated with effects on the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) [

 <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In those species, essential oil supplementation increased digestibility, improved pancreatic enzymes’ activity, changed microbiota, impacted the absorption of amino acids in the intestines, and, consequently, feed conversion rate [

 <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The supplementation also increases immunoglobulins levels and immune response [

 <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, there is inconsistent data between other species, probably explained by the complexity of the essential oils’ molecules and differences among the many types of GIT [
 <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that essential oils supplementation in calf’s solid starter improves performance [
