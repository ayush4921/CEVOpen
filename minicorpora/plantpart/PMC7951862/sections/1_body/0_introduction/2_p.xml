<p>Therefore, tools that help provide proper nutrition, and improve heifer development and health, are essential to reduce disease morbidity and mortality and accelerate the calf development. Additionally, since a calf is born functionally as a non-ruminant, the digestive system, and other organs and tissues, change in several weeks and the microbiota colonization changes to adapt to these transformations [
