<p>Since the discovery of the improvement in animal growth due to antibiotics almost 80 years ago, antibiotic growth promoters (AGP) have been widely used as a tool to improve both rumen development and animal health [

 <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], prevent diseases, and increase performance and feed efficiency [
 <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, the use of AGP in animal production for these purposes has been under severe criticism and banned in several countries [
 <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The overuse of antimicrobial’s concerns human health since there is already a well-established correlation between the increase of bacterial population resistance and the use of AGP, putting both humans and animals at risk [
 <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The World Health Organization considers the antimicrobial resistance one of the three major threats to public health [
 <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, the global trends in antimicrobial use show that some countries with the largest share of global antimicrobial consumption in food animals initiated a shift toward a more conservative use [
 <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The EU banned the use of AGP since 2006 [
 <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and the US published the Veterinary Feed Directive in 2015, which limited the use of AGP under the professional supervision of a licensed veterinarian [
 <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and banned all medically important antimicrobials for humans in 2017 [
 <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Other big livestock producing countries, such as China and Mexico, are also changing the acceptability of AGP’s use in food animal production [
 <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Therefore, there is a motivation for more prudent use of antimicrobials [
 <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and research for substitutes that can improve animal performance and health. A large number of new additives such as prebiotics and probiotics, organic acids, phytogenic substances, and essential oils have shown good results to improve animal production [
 <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and appear to be a good alternative to decrease the use of AGP and alleviate the antimicrobial resistance [
 <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. One of these alternatives is the phytogenic feed additives, also known as phytobiotics and botanicals, commonly defined as plant secondary compounds [
