0: Studies focusing on essential oils action as growth promotors for pigs and poultry show the supplementations positive effects, generally associated with effects on the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) [ 26,  27].
1: In those species, essential oil supplementation increased digestibility, improved pancreatic enzymes activity, changed microbiota, impacted the absorption of amino acids in the intestines, and, consequently, feed conversion rate [ 27 29].
2: The supplementation also increases immunoglobulins levels and immune response [ 30], decreases specify pathogens concentrations in feces [ 31,  32] and presented an insecticidal [ 33], acaricidal and antioxidant effects [ 34].
3: However, there is inconsistent data between other species, probably explained by the complexity of the essential oils molecules and differences among the many types of GIT [ 19].
4: Previous studies have shown that essential oils supplementation in calfs solid starter improves performance [ 35,  36], rumen fermentation [ 37], and diarrhea severity [ 38].
5: However, the effects on liquid diet supplementation are scarce.
