0: This study aimed to evaluate if the supplementation of a commercial blend of essential oils (BEO) in milk replacer (MR) affects feed intake, performance, feed efficiency, body development, blood cells and metabolites, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), ruminal parameters, fecal and respiratory scores of dairy heifers during pre-weaning and post-weaning periods.
1: We hypothesized that BEO supplementation in MR during pre-weaning would improve performance and positively influence blood parameters and health scores of dairy heifers.
