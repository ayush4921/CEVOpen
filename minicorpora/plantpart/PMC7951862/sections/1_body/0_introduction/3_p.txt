0: Since the discovery of the improvement in animal growth due to antibiotics almost 80 years ago, antibiotic growth promoters (AGP) have been widely used as a tool to improve both rumen development and animal health [ 5,  6], prevent diseases, and increase performance and feed efficiency [ 7,  8].
1: However, the use of AGP in animal production for these purposes has been under severe criticism and banned in several countries [ 9].
2: The overuse of antimicrobials concerns human health since there is already a well-established correlation between the increase of bacterial population resistance and the use of AGP, putting both humans and animals at risk [ 10].
3: The World Health Organization considers the antimicrobial resistance one of the three major threats to public health [ 11].
4: However, the global trends in antimicrobial use show that some countries with the largest share of global antimicrobial consumption in food animals initiated a shift toward a more conservative use [ 12].
5: The EU banned the use of AGP since 2006 [ 13] and the US published the Veterinary Feed Directive in 2015, which limited the use of AGP under the professional supervision of a licensed veterinarian [ 14] and banned all medically important antimicrobials for humans in 2017 [ 11].
6: Other big livestock producing countries, such as China and Mexico, are also changing the acceptability of AGPs use in food animal production [ 11].
7: Therefore, there is a motivation for more prudent use of antimicrobials [ 15] and research for substitutes that can improve animal performance and health.
8: A large number of new additives such as prebiotics and probiotics, organic acids, phytogenic substances, and essential oils have shown good results to improve animal production [ 4,  16] and appear to be a good alternative to decrease the use of AGP and alleviate the antimicrobial resistance [ 16,  17].
9: One of these alternatives is the phytogenic feed additives, also known as phytobiotics and botanicals, commonly defined as plant secondary compounds [ 18,  19].
