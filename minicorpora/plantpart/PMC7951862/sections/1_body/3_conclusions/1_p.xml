<p>Feeding BEO to pre-weaned heifers on MR did not affect intake, performance parameters, blood metabolites, or IGF-1 concentration. However, it changed C2:C3 proportion during pre- and post-weaning periods, showed signs of immunity improvement, and lower fecal scores in the pre-weaning phase. Therefore, essential oils are a health additive option to modern production systems and could be used as an alternative to improve calf health and performance. Further research is needed to define the best route and dosage, understand the contribution of essential oils to decrease neonatal diseasesâ€™ morbidity, and verify the possible interaction with other molecules.</p>
