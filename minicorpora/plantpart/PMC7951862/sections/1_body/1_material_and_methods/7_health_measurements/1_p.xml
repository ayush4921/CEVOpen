<p>Health measurements (fecal and respiratory scores) were performed daily, in the morning, before other animal management. Fecal scores were graded according to the University of Wisconsin calf health scoring chart [
 <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], as follows: 0 –normal (firm but not hard); 1 –soft (does not hold form, piles but spreads slightly); 2 –runny (spreads readily to about 6 mm depth); and 3 –watery (liquid consistency, splatters). A heifer was considered to have diarrhea if the fecal score was 2 or 3. Severe diarrhea was considered when the fecal score was 3.
