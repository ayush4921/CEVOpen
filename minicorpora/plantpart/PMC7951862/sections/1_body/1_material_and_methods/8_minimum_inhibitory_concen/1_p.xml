<p>The broth dilution method was used to evaluate the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of BEO against two relevant enteric bacteria: enterotoxigenic 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (K99
 <sup>+</sup> strain) and 
 <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> previously isolated from an outbreak in calves [
 <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Two different preparations of BEO product were used to perform MIC: a—homogenized in purified water; b—homogenized in a solution with 3.0 g of isopropyl myristate, 8.25 g of propylene glycol, 7.25 g of Tween 80 (Sigma-Aldrich, Santo André, Brazil) and 100 mL of water. Both preparations were submitted to 0.22 μm filtration. A solution with an initial concentration of 1.0 mg/mL was submitted to serial dilutions from 1:2 to 1:256 in 96-wells plates. Thus, 100 μL of a solution containing 5 x 10
 <sup>5</sup> CFU/mL of the two selected bacteria. After overnight incubation at 35°C, microtiter plates were examined for visible bacterial growth evidenced by turbidity and color change.
