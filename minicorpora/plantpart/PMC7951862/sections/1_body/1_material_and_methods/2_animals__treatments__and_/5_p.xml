<p>At 4 d of age, heifers were assigned to one of two experimental treatments maintaining a balance of the birth month, birth BW, genetic composition, and % Brix value. They were fed at 5 L/d of an MR (Kalvolak, Nutrifeed, Netherlands; 
 <xref rid="pone.0231068.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) reconstituted at 15% (dry matter basis), divided into two equal meals (0800 and 1600 h) into buckets provided with rubber teats (Milkbar). The experimental treatments were: Control, no additive (CON; n = 15), and a commercial blend of essential oils additive supplemented at a rate of 1 g/d/calf (BEO, Apex Calf, Adisseo, China; n = 14), as recommended by the manufacturing company. The blend of essential oils is a dry powder that contains a mix of plant extracts derived from anise, cinnamon, garlic, rosemary, and thyme. The amount of the additive for each meal was weighed to have 0.5 g and kept in 15 mL tubes in a dark box. They were then mixed with a 10 mL of MR, homogenized, and incorporated in 0.49 L of MR (0.5 g/calf at morning meal and 0.5 g/calf at afternoon meal) to ensure total ingestion of the product. Immediately after ingesting 0.5 L MR with 0.5 g of the blend of essential oils, the rest of the meal was given. One person was responsible for refilling the milk bucket as soon as the animals had finished, so it would not change the ingestion rate. This person would also evaluate MR acceptance.
