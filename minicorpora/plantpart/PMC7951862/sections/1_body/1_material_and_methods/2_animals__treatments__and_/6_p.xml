The amount of corn silage provided was enough to result in at least 10% orts, and the starter intake was fixed for a maximum of 3.0 kg calf/d, divided into two meals. All heifers were dehorned at 70 d of age and received local anesthesia (5.0 mL/horn, Lidovet, Bravet, Engenho Novo, Brazil) and 2 d of non-steroid anti-inflammatory treatment (0.025 mL/kg, Maxicam 2%, Ouro fino, Cravinhos, Brazil).
