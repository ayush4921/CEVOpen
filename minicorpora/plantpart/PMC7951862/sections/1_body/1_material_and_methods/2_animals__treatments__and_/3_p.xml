<p>From 2 to 3 d of age, heifers were fed 5 L/d of transition milk divided into two equal meals offered at 0800 and 1600 h, in buckets provided with rubber teats (Milkbar, New Zealand). At 3 d of age, blood samples were collected via jugular venipuncture with a clot activator tube (Labor Import, Osasco, Brazil). They were left at room temperature for 30 min and then centrifuged at 1,800 ×
