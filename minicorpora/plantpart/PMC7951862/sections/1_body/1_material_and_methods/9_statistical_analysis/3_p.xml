<p>The continuous outcomes such as intakes, structural growth, ruminal, and blood parameters were analyzed with ANOVA. A 95% Confidence Interval was adopted to verify the null hypothesis, and 
 <italic>P</italic>-values were produced with a Fisher test. All outcomes were tested for normality to meet the required assumptions of this model, and a variable transformation was applied to milk replacer intakes to meet that assumption.
