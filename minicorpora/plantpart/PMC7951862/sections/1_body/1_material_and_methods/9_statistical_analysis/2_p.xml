<p>The analysis of each outcome was performed independently of all others using linear mixed models (package: nlme). Each independent outcome was modeled as a function of the following fixed effects: treatment, experimental week, the interaction between treatment and week. The genetic composition of the animal was included as a blocking effect. Birth month, birth body weight and Brix value were assessed only to verify if the animals were homogeneously distributed but were not used as a blocking effect. Birth weight and serum Brix value were tested as a covariate but did not improve statistical significance. Therefore, they were eliminated from the model. The effect of heifer within treatment was included in the models to account for individual variability.</p>
