<p>Statistical analysis was conducted utilizing R
 <sup>®</sup> (R Core Team, 2019). The data collected was summarized by period (pre-weaning– 4 to 60 d and post-weaning– 61 to 90 d) and per week within each period. A randomized complete block experimental design with repeated measures was implemented to test the hypothesis of the effect of the blend of essential oils on each performance outcome. More specifically, the outcomes analyzed were feed intake, structural growth, ruminal, blood, and health parameters. The control treatment was assigned 15 experimental units (CON), while the blend of essential oils supplementation treatment was assigned 14 (BEO).
