<p>Feed intake (MR, starter, water, and corn silage) were measured daily. Samples of MR, starter, and corn silage were collected three times a week to obtain a weekly pool for nutritional analyses. Samples of starter and corn silage were oven-dried at 55Â°C for 72 h and ground in Wiley mill (model 3, Arthur H. Thomas Co., Philadelphia, PA) through a 1-mm screen before analysis. Starter, corn silage, and MR were analyzed to determine DM (Method 934.01), CP (Method 988.05), ether extract (Method 920.39), ash (Method 942.05), according to AOAC [
