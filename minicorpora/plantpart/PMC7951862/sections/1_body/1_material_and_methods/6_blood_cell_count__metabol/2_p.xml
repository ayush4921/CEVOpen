<p>Blood samples were collected for complete blood count during preweaning at 0, 30 and 60 d of age, by jugular vein puncture into EDTA tubes (Labor Import, Osasco, Brazil), and immediately transported on ice to the laboratory. An automatic hematology cell counter (SDH– 3 vet, Labtest Diagnóstica S.A., Brazil) was used to evaluate: red blood cell count (RBC), packed cell volume (PCV), hemoglobin (Hb), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), platelet and total white blood cell count. Manual white cell blood differential counting was also performed by microscopic examination evaluating 100 leukocytes in a 1,000 x microscopic magnification for total leukocyte count, basophils, eosinophils, neutrophils, band neutrophils, segmented neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes. Morphological changes, such as toxic neutrophils, reactive lymphocytes, and activated monocytes, were calculated [
