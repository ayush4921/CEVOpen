<p>Jugular blood samples were collected at birth before colostrum ingestion and, 3 h after morning feeding on days 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 60, 67, 74, 81 and 90, for beta-hydroxybutyric acid (BHB), urea and glucose and, on days 0, 14, 28, 42, 60, 74 and 90, for IGF-1 concentrations. Blood samples were collected into tubes without anticoagulant (for BHB and urea), with sodium fluoride (for glucose), or with heparin for IGF-1 (Labor Import, Osasco, Brazil). They were immediately transported on ice to the laboratory and were centrifuged at 3000 x 
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at room temperature (22–25°C). Two aliquots of each metabolite and hormone sample were individually allocated into microtubes and frozen at -20°C for further analysis. The serum concentration of BHB and urea were determined by an auto-analyzer (Cobas Mira Plus, Roche Diagnostic Systems, Risch-Rotkreuz, Switzerland) using commercial kits (Ranbut-D-3-Hidroxibutyrate, Randox Laboratories Ltd., Antrim, UK; Urea UV, Kovalent do Brasil Ltda., Bom Retiro São Gonçalo, Brazil). Plasma glucose was measured in a microplate Spectrophotometer EON (Biotek Instruments Inc., Winooski, VT) using the enzymatic colorimetric method (Kovalent do Brasil Ltda., Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). The plasma concentrations of IGF-1 were analyzed using chemiluminescence assay (Immulite2000 Systems 1038144, IGF-1 200, Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Products Ltd., Llanberis, Gwynedd, UK).
