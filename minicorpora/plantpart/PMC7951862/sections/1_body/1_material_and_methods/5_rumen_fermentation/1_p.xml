<p>Rumen fluid samples were collected through an oroesophageal tube 4 h after morning feeding at 14, 28, 42, 60, 74, and 90 d of age, and pH was assessed using a portable potentiometer (Phmetro T-1000, Tekna, Araucária, Brazil). Two aliquots of 10 mL of ruminal fluid were separated. One was acidified with 1 mL of 20% metaphosphoric acid, and the other with 2 mL of 50% sulfuric acid. These samples were stored at -20°C for further analysis of VFA and nitrogen ammonia. Nitrogen ammonia concentration was quantified using the colorimetric distillation method proposed by Chaney and Marbach [
