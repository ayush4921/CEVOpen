<p>Intake of starter, water, total DM, CP, and gross energy, ADG and feed efficiency were not affected by treatment during pre- and post-weaning (Tables 
 <xref rid="pone.0231068.t002" ref-type="table">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="pone.0231068.t003" ref-type="table">3</xref>). A previous study tested a commercial blend of essential oils for dairy calves using two supplementation routes (MR and starter), and had similar results for intake, BW and ADG during preweaning [
 <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. However, other studies that also used a commercial source of essential oils in the starter found better ADG and feed efficiency during the preweaning period for supplemented calves, as well as higher BW during weaning [

 <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. As for the carry-over effect on post-weaning in those studies, it has been observed that calves supplemented with essential oils in the starter had higher ADG and lower feed efficiency [
 <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In our study, we did not find any carry-over effect on post-weaning for the performance outcomes.
