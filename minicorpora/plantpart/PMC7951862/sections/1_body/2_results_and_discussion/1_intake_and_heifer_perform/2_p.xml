<p>The supplemented heifers consumed the same amount of liquid diet as the control group, indicating no ingestibility issues of BEO (
 <xref rid="pone.0231068.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Differences described in the literature between flavor and palatability of BEOs could be due to the delivery method, as well as essential oil plant sources and extraction process [
 <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Studies using different supplemented types of essential oils to other animal speciesâ€™ reported different preferences and acceptability of these essential oils, with changes among animal species and category, juvenile x adults [
 <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Previous work with weaned heifers supplemented with cinnamaldehyde essential oil in a total mix ration showed a preference in the taste of the ration without additive. This supplementation caused a change of feed intake, and it was related to palatability problems with the essential oil used in the experiment [
 <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. However, although cinnamon is an ingredient that is in the mixture in our study, we did not run a palatability test to verify this outcome. It must be point also that the additive was given mixed with a small amount of MR to allow complete ingestion. Visually, the time on ingestion was the same, and all the calves consumed all MR. Therefore, ingestibility of the mixture was not a problem, However, further tests with essential oils palatability to dairy calves are needed.
