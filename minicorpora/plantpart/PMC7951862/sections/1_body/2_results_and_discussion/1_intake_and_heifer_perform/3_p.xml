<p>Although there were no differences between MR intake between treatment and the given amount was fixed, there were a week effect and a week and treatment interaction effect (

From the end of week 1 until week 3, heifers had diarrhea and this event impacted on MR intake, since intake decrease when animals are sick. Differences between treatments were observed in those weeks, with lower intake for the CON. An observed effect between fecal scores and MR intake was found (
 <italic>P ≤</italic> 0.001), besides a low correlation value (- 0.25). Thus, results revealed a negative association between both parameters, where higher fecal scores reduced MR intake, and vice versa.
