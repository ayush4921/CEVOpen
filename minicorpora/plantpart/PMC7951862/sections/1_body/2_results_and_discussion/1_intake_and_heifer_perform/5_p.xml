<p>In our study, the lack of differences in evaluated outcomes could be because of the supply route, dosage, or the essential oil plant sources and extraction process. It also must be highlighted that the starter provided contained monensin and other probiotic additives. They are important and efficient additives used not only as a growth promoter but also as coccidiosis control and prevention [

It must also be highlighted that monensin was provided in the starter and the essential oil in the milk replacer. Thus, they would act in different compartments, the rumen and the intestines. To better understand this interaction and a possible effect, it is necessary for other studies to evaluate the impact of the essential oilâ€™s supplementation with or without monensin, as also the mechanism of action of the different essential oils.
