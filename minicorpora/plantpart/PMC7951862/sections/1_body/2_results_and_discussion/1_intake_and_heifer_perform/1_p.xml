<p>Most studies evaluate essential oils or a supplement with BEO to dairy calves, feed the additive in the starter to benefit rumen development, and accelerate growth. However, the intake of starter in the first weeks of age is small [
 <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], and the timing of the occurrence of enteric diseases is mainly on the first 30 days of life [
 <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Due to the calf’s limited capability of ingesting large solid feed amounts in the first days of life, the supplement intake in the starter could be limited, and the desired supplementation level may not be achieved based on intake levels of the starter. Therefore, in this trial, BEO was offered in the liquid diet since the aim was to verify if it would impact on disease morbidity and gut development, and subsequently, on animal’s performance.
