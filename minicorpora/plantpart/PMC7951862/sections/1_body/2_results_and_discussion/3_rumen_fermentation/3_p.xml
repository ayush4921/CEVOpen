<p>Changes in these profiles in rumen fluid would also alter the acetate:propionate (C2:C3) proportions. Since butyrate and propionate are important for ruminal papillae development, and especially propionate is used in the gluconeogenesis route [
 <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], a smaller C2:C3 ratio is wanted. In this experiment, BEO supplementation did not alter VFA values, but did reduced the C2:C3 proportion during the pre- (

 <italic>P</italic> = 0.006) (
 <xref rid="pone.0231068.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Confirming these findings, previous studies registered a lower C2:C3 proportion for calves in both groups supplemented with essential oils in the starter (1.56 and 1.47) compared with two control groups (2.02 and 1.77) [
 <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. On the other hand, reports are not always constant in the literature, since higher C2:C3 proportion for pre-weaning calves supplemented with thyme essential oils (2.25 x 1.78) were already reported [
 <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Despite our findings, it must be highlighted that, in our experiment, essential oils were provided mixed in small amounts of MR to ensure the whole intake of the product. If the BEO was provided in the starter, changes in the rumen would be expected. By providing the BEO in the MR, the treatment should bypass the rumen and have minimal impact on local ruminal microbiota and VFA. Nevertheless, since the MR amount was small and given at the beginning of the feeding, one hypothesis could be that the esophageal groove was still open, permitting essential oils content to arrive at the rumen. Another hypothesis could be a potential communication from the intestines and the forestomach were the nutrients on the lower gut caused adaptations on the upper gut, improving its function and growth, as well as nutrient use and differences in VFA proportions [
 <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In monogastric animals, supplementation of essential oils has shown a direct effect on the gut microflora and effects on the gut-associated immune system, causing positive changes in nutrient digestibility and animal performance [
 <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. A third theory to explain the changes in C2:C3 is that the changes in rumen could not be only by the BEO supplementation, but the interaction between the BEO and the monensin in the starter. They have a similar mechanism of actions and could cause the increase in propionate in the rumen, not enough to be seen when evaluating the VFA alone, but shifting ruminal fermentation and cause differences in C2:C3 proportions [
