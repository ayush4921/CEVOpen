<p>There were no differences in ruminal pH for CON and BEO treatments during the pre-weaning period. Previous studies also did not find changes in ruminal pH for animals supplemented with essential oils [

Since there were no differences between treatments during pre-weaning, the carry-over effect may not be assumed to be the answer to this difference. Although no differences in intake were observed, heifersâ€™ ingestion behavior might justify the difference in post-weaning pH. In other words, the amount of starter consumed before sampling and its impact on ruminal pH. However, this behavior was not evaluated since intake was measure only once every 24 hours.
