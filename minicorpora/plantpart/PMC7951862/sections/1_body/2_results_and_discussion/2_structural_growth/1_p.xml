<p>Structural body growth was not affected by BEO supplementation in MR (

 <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.001) was detected in all variables due to healthy animal growth. It was previously suggested that essential oils supplementation could only be effective in structural growth when associated with higher protein concentration in the starter due to an interaction between protein level supplementation and essential oils supplementation [

 <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In our study, the calves were fed with protein levels to meet their requirements for optimal growth. However, we did not test different protein levels to see if this interaction could change structural growth. On the other hand, in other species, the increase in structural growth, as well as daily weight gain and feed conversion for supplemented animals, are generally related to a more mature and developed gut. This more developed gut helps the supplement to be absorbed more quickly, improving gut immunity and microbiota, and as a consequence, the animals’ body growth [
