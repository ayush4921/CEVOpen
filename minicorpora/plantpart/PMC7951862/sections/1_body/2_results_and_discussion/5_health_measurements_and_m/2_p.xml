<p>The supplementation of essential oils has already shown beneficial results for lowering diarrhea and fecal scores in other species with the same efficiency of AGPs [

 <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. For piglets, where this is a prevalent disease and caused by similar agents as in calves, it has been shown favorable results with lower diarrhea prevalence for treated animals [
 <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. In our study, the average age for diarrhea (scores 2 and 3) occurrence was 12.2 ± 3.6 d for BEO and 13.6 ± 3.8 d for CON with no statistical difference (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.54). Diarrhea incidence on pre-weaning in BEO treatment was 85% against 93% for CON treatment with no statistical difference (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.68). The fecal score was different between treatments (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.04), with lower values for BEO, and changed over time (
 <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.001, 
 <xref rid="pone.0231068.t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>). Days with diarrhea (scores 2 and 3, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.24) and days with severe diarrhea (score 3, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.12) were not different between treatments (
 <xref rid="pone.0231068.t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>). Three animals of each treatment were medicated for diarrhea with anti-inflammatories, and the therapy duration was 1.6 ± 0.57 d for BEO and 3.0 ± 1 d for CON. It is noteworthy that this treatment was done outside the hemogram and total cell count evaluation in this study. Besides no differences in the diarrhea prevalence, the lower fecal score in the BEO could point to better gut health and less microbiota disability [
 <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. However, is important to point out that we did not collect samples to analyze microbiota changes before, during, and after diarrhea, or pathogenic bacteria count in feces.
