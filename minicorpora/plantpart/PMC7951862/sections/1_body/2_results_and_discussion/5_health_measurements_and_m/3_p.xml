<p>Evaluation of the respiratory score parameters indicated that 2 BEO animals and 1 of CON animals exceeded score 4, indicating respiratory disease on pre-weaning. The average days with a high score were 1.0 ± 0 d for BEO and CON. No effect was found on days with high respiratory score or number of affected animals. However, a week and an interaction week x treatment effect on pre-weaning was observed, with the difference between treatment scores and lower values for the BEO in week 2 (

It is known that diarrhea and respiratory problems are caused by a combination of factors and related to the immunity status, nutrition, type of housing, and season [

Weeks 5 and 6 showed a lower score difference between treatments and a lower incidence of respiratory signs. The number of treated animals was 2 for BEO only during the preweaning period, with an average of treatment days of 1.3 ± 1.4, and 3 for CON with an average of treatment days of 2.0 ± 0.57. Treatments occurred only in the pre-weaning period using antibiotics and anti-inflammatories.
