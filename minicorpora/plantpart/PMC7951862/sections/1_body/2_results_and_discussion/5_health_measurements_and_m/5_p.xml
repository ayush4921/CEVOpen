<p>It has been reported that essential oils have an antiseptic and antimicrobial activity that may help balance intestinal microbiota [

 <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], but Gram-negative bacteria and some types of parasites can also be susceptible [
 <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] to different essential oils. Thus, some essential oils could reduce the incidence and severity of diarrhea syndrome in calves through inhibition of coliform overgrowth [

Thus, outcomes found on fecal and respiratory scores could be related to indirect changes in hemato-biochemical parameters and not with a direct antibacterial effect.
