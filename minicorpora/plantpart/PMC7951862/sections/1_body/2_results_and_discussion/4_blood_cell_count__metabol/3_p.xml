<p>All blood cell counts were within normal range based on age and species normality. Changes in blood cell count are typical during heifer growth, and blood cells tend to increase with animal age [
 <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. These changes corroborate with the week effect on mean corpuscular volume (MCV), basophils, eosinophils, segmented neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and platelets (

 <xref rid="pone.0231068.t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). Leukogram parameters showed decreased counts of basophil and platelet cells in BEO treatment (
 <italic>P</italic> â‰¤ 0.05). Basophils and platelets originate from different myeloid precursors and, both play essential roles in inflammation balance and immune response development in mammal [
 <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. The lower counts of basophil and platelets on BEO treatment may influence and modulate inflammatory response by secretion of immune modulators [
 <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], growth factors, or chemotaxis on a variety of white blood cells [
 <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. This modulation could help explain an interaction effect found for lymphocytes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231068.g002">Fig 2</xref>), where values of d 30 and 60 were different from d 1 with an accentuated increase in BEO. There have been reports of immune response potentiation of piglets supplemented with essential oils. The animals had improved lymphocyte proliferation, phagocytosis rate, and humoral immune response [
