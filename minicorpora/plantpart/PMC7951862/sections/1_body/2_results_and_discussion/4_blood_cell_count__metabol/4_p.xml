<p>Oregano and thyme oils supplemented to Holstein calves positively influenced erythrogram parameters, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and band neutrophils with higher values for treated calves [

Although our results demonstrate a decrease in basophil and platelet counts, it is necessary to perform novel experiments to characterize the effects of BEO on the inflammatory and coagulation process in heifers. Differences between PLR and NLR were not found (
