<p>During the pre- and post-weaning periods, all blood metabolites were not altered by BEO supplementation (

 <xref rid="pone.0231068.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>), since they are directly correlated with fatty acid metabolism and ruminal ammonia concentration, respectively [

 <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.001). Since this hormone is a mitogen and related to cell proliferation and differentiation, it is correlated with BW and animal growth [
