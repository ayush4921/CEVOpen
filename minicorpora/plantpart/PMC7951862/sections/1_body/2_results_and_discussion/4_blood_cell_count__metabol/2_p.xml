<p>Glucose did not change during the pre-weaning phase and decreased during the post-weaning period (
 <xref rid="pone.0231068.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). Taking into account that calves use glucose as a primary source of energy in the firsts weeks of age, these age-related changes are associated with changes in diet and rumen development [
 <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. After weaning, calves complete their rumen development and, VFA produced by ruminal microbiota becomes the primary energy source, justifying BHB concentration increase, and glucose concentration decrease [

 <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. However, since there were changes in C2:C3 proportion in the BEO, the increase of propionic acid could consequently impact glucose blood concentration. Since essential oils can increase insulin sensitivity, not finding glucose differences between treatments does not mean that there were no changes in the glucose pathway [

 <xref rid="pone.0231068.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Therefore, further investigations over these aspects are needed.
