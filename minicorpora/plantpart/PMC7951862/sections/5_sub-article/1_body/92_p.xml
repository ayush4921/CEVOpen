<p>Line 358- Suggest “An observed effect between fecal scores…” Although I am not sure this correlation really adds to your point. It seems like your objective is to determine a treatment by time interaction of your variables in response to BEO which can be described for both MR intake and fecal scores already without a further correlation between the two. As a reader I think I would be ok with you stating that MR intake was lower during certain weeks (if significant) and also fecal scores were elevated during those same weeks which are likely related because intake decreases when animals are sick.</p>
