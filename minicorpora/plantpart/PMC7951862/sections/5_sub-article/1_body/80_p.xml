<p>Line 283-294: It is unclear why a 1 microgram/mL concentration was chosen as your concentration to test the MIC. If my calculations are correct 1 g of BEO= 1,000,000 micrograms. When 1,000,000 micrograms are divided by the fluid volume of milk replacer provided per day to each calf (5,000 mL) this is 200 micrograms per ML for the dosage rate, yet you tested 1 microgram/mL. Could you explain in more detail why the concentration that was used for MIC was done and how this relates to the your actual feeding rate in the experiment. Suggest discussion in your results and discussion section.</p>
