<p>Au: Thank you for your concern. Your calculations are right, and the dose used in the MIC was wrongly expressed. We wanted to say that we started with an initial concentration of 1.0 mg/mL (Five times higher than the one used for the calves), and then we diluted it from 1:2 until 1:256. We changed to the correct measure unit. We are sorry for the misunderstanding (L. 305).</p>
