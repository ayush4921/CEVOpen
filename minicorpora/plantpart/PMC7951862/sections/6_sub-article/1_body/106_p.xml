<p>Au: Thank you for your concern. We formulated the diet and increased the solids in the milk replacer to meet the requirement to our calves for optimal growth. However, we did not test different protein levels in the starter or in the milk replacer to see their interaction with the essential oil supplementation. We added a statement to the manuscript to clarify this point (L.424-426). </p>
