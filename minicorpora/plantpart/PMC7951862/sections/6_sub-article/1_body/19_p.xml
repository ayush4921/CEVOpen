<p>Lines 80-88: Antibiotic growth promoters and antibiotics used for treatment of acute onset of illness are not the same. The statement that 90% of dairy farms provide AGPs for disease prevention (Line 86) is not correct, for several reasons. First, the publication from which you reference this percentage uses data collected from the mid to late 2000s, and was published prior to the USDA’s Veterinary Feed Directive in 2015. Under the VFD, use of AGPs is no longer permitted on US dairy farms without Veterinary supervision (nor in most other countries). Second, according to the literature referenced, this number refers to the percentage of dairy farms in the US that administer antibiotics at dry-off to prevent intramammary infection during the dry period- which is not the same as an AGP. I also caution you about your reference to 80% of all antibiotics used in the country are from livestock production (Line 84); this number was calculated by ‘public health advocacy groups’ and is cautioned against in the publication by the FDA. Many glaring inconsistencies exist in data attempting to find the source of antibiotic overuse, and the reality is that judicious use of antimicrobials needs to happen across all health sectors, not just one. Also not recommended to use the word “abuse” (Line 88); suggest ‘overuse’ instead.</p>
