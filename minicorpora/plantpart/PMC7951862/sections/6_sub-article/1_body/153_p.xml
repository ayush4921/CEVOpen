<p>Au: Thank you for your concern. Indeed, there were no statistical differences in ruminal ammonia or the individual VFA values. However, there was a statistical difference within the proportion between the VFA. Therefore, we believe that besides no statistical difference in the VFA alone, it could be a biological difference that could lead to the difference in the proportions.</p>
