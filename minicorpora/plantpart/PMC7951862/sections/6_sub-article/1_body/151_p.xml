<p>Au. Thank you for your question. Some studies reported the there is a higher level of bioactivity at acidic pH. So, at low pH the essential oils behave in a more hydrophobic way and enter more easily inside the cells. This explains how the antimicrobial activity of the essential oils is enhanced at low pH.</p>
