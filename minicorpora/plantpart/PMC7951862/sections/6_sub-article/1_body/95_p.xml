<p>Line 367- according to table 3 feed efficiency in the preweaning period tended to be lower in calves supplemented with BEO but no difference postweaning. On Line 375 you make about postweaning feed efficiency carry over effects but there does not appear to be any carryover effects in terms of intake or feed efficiency in your experiment. It is unclear what connections and conclusions you are trying to make here.</p>
