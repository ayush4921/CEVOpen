<p>Question related to palatability- The feeding of BEO in this study was done in a small portion of the milk replacer each day and the full feeding was not given until after that had been consumed? When trying to interpret effects of BEO addition on palatability I would be cautious or maybe incorporate this point into the discussion.</p>
