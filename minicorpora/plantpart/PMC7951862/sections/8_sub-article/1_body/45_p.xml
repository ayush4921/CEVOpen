<p>Au: Thank you for your concern. The rest of the meal was only given after the calf consumed all the MR containing the additive. Although we did not see any visual difference in the time of MR intake, we agree that we could not say that the calves did not have any palatability issue with the additive since this outcome was not tested. We changed our statement in the discussion section (L. 359 -364).</p>
