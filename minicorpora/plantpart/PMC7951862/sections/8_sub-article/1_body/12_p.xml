<p>I have an issue with the discussion of palatability in the discussion section. I do not believe that this was a true test of the palatability of the additive because it was dosed in a small portion of the milk replacer diet and calves were not given the rest of their milk replacer allotment until the initial dose had been consumed. While palatability is an important question to ask I think the authors make too bold of conclusions based on this experiment and do not address the limitations of how this was conducted and evaluated. </p>
