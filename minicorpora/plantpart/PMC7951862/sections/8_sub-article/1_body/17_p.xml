<p>Au: Thank you for your concern. We make different points about what could have happened. The essential oils were fed in the milk replacer. If they were fed in the starter, changes in the rumen would be obvious and easy to explain. However, since they were fed in the milk replacer, they should bypasss the rumen to the abomasum and intestines. Therefore, one theory would be that the esophageal groove was still one and the oils could have entered the rumen. Other theory it about the potential connections between the intestinal tract. Those are all hypothesis. And to make a clearer statement we have changed the paragraph (L. 473 - 484).</p>
