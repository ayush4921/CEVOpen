<p>Au: Thank you for your concern. We acknowledge that there was a mistake in the way that this statement was written, thus we rewrote to make it clearer. We used only genetic composition as a blocking effect. The animals were randomly assigned to the treatments. Birth month, birth BW and % Brix were assessed only to check if the groups were balanced. (L. 30- 32; 322-325).</p>
