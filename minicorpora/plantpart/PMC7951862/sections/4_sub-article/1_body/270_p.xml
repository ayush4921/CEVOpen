<p>We did the in vitro study to see if we could find a direct effect of the essential oilsâ€™ molecules over bacteria. Apparently, this product does not show direct action over the tested bacteria. However, the supplementation with essential oils on animals change some immunological values, and those could explain differences found in the fecal score. Using different dosages and routes of supplementation could help us clarify some results in this paper. </p>
