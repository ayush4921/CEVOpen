<p>Au: Thank you for your concern. Edited. The relative centrifugal force (RFC) is generated when a particle is subjected to a circular motion. The unit of measurement of the RCF is g, which is equivalent to the acceleration of gravity on the Earth's surface. Thus, the speed of a centrifuge will be provided in RCF (or g-force) or rotations per minute (rpm). (L140, 230). </p>
