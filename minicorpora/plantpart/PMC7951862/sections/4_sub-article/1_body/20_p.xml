<p>Au: Thank you for your concern. The company organization did not play a role in the study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript and only provided financial support in the form of research materials. They also do not have any decision on the sharing of data and materials. The two authors that are employed by a commercial company helped with providing materials for the trial on the revision to publish the article.</p>
