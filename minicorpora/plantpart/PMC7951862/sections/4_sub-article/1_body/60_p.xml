<p>Au: Thank you for your contribution. The manly parameters evaluated in a good calf rearing program are average dairy gain and disease incidence. Since we also did in this trial, we thought that it would be nice to explain why they are so important and why we choose to measure them. It is also important to point that we did measure immune system parameters, and those are highly correlated with weight gain and animalâ€™s health. For that reason, we decided to keep this paragraph (L61-70)</p>
