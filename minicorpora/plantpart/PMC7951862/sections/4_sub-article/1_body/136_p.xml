<p>Au: Thank you for your contribution. We revised the paper and saw that we specify the wrong days. We have taken a blood sample on day 0 that worked as a baseline before treatment. The sample of day 4 was used only to check blood Brix value. For the following days, we collected every 7 days and on the weaning day. For the post-weaning period, animals were collected based on the weaning day, which was day 60. Since the last blood collection on day 88, but animals would be out of the trial on day 90, we have pushed that blood sampling for 2 days. We corrected (L225-227).</p>
