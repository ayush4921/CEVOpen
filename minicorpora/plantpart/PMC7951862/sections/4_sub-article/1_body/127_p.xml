<p>Line 192: Introduction states that rumen fluid was collected every 2 wk; however, collection days listed do not follow a 14-day pattern. Days listed are 14, 28, 42, 60, 74, and 90; a 14-day pattern would be 14, 28, 42, 56, 70 and 84. If samples were collected in a different timeframe than originally stated, please discuss. It seems as though the later collection dates were adjusted to account for collection on days that calves were weaned (60d) and also at the end of the collection period (90).</p>
