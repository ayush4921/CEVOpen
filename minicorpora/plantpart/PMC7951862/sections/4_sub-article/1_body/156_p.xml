<p>Au: Thank you for your contribution. We perform the minimum inhibitory concentration to understand how the essential oils were acting on the changes of the fecal and respiratory scores, as well as the blood cells. However, this assay and results of it did not influence the given dosage. The idea of doing it came after the trial with the calves was already finished (L283).</p>
