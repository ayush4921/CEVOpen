<p>Au: We apologize for the misunderstanding. We reformulate the sentence to make clear the statement (L157). All animals received milk replacer. Feeding time was at the same time. Animals were feed from the youngest to the oldest, always obeying this order. We also colored code the feeding buckets and washed them separately to avoid product residue to be feed to an animal, not in the treatment group. Feeding all animals would not last more than half an hour. So, we do think that did not influence blood measurements since we also did sampling from the youngest to the oldest. Animals from BEO treatment received 0.5L mixed with the blend of essential oil, and a bucket was put in front of their stall with the other 2.0 L. One person was responsible for refilling the milk bucket after they finished. Animals from the control group received the 2.5 L all at once. However, since we would refill the BEO group as soon as they finish, there were no differences in time and amount of milk replacer intake.</p>
