<p>Au: Thank you for your contribution. Also, as cited above, there was a miscommunication with the exact days of blood sampling. Samples for IGF-1 were taken on the day of birth as a baseline, and after that, every 14 days. Since day 56 was close to day 60 (the weaning day), it was chosen just to use the sample form day 60 since it would change that much. Sampling on the post-weaning phase took the weaning day as a basis, and for the same reason that happened during the pre-weaning phase, we choose to use the sampling that would be on day 88 and push it to day 90 (L226-227).</p>
