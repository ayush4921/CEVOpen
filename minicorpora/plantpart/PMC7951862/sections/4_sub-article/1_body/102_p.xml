<p>Au: Thank you for your concern. Water and starter intake values, both from pre-weaning and post-weaning, are available in table 2. All animals receive ad libitum water and starter during pre-weaning. And ad libitum water and 3 kg of starter on post-weaning. Water and starter were available since day 0 of the trial (L144-146).</p>
