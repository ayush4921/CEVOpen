<p>Au: Thank you for your concern. When an animal developed respiratory signs such as nose and eye discharge, cough, and fever, we would do pulmonary auscultation to check if we could find some shortness of breath, edema, and crepitation. Does were sighs of pulmonary commitment. We added that explanation to the text (L280).</p>
