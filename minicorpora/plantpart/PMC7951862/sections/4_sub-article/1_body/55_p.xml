<p>Au: Edited, thank you (L52-54, 56). We also check on PlosOne submission rules, and they do not say about allowing it or not P-values, but they said the abstract should: “Summarize the most important results and their significance.” We also found other papers already publish in PlosOne that used P-values in the abstract: Pone.0191687 and Pone.0146488. Therefore, we thought that it would be interesting to leave the P-values (L 52-55).</p>
