<p>Table 1: Is this analyzed composition? Table heading should stand alone, suggest addition of “fed to calves”. You said you took samples for nutrient analysis but did not present standard deviations of feed ingredients. “unless otherwise noted” can be deleted. Extra space between % of in Organic matter heading. Was starch measured? It would be a good addition to analysis. Superscript 1 is not required. Superscript 2- if commercial milk can you provide brand name and company? Starter ingredients I think it is useful to know but not sure if entire list is necessary in this case.</p>
