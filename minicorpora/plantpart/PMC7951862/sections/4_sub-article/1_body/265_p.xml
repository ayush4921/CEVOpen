<p>Au: Thank you for your concern. We apologize for the misunderstanding. We reformulated the sentence. We did not evaluate the direct correlation of the enteric cases and respiratory cases. So, you are right that we cannot make this assumption. However, since both diseases are multifactorial and have an association already cited in the literature, we suppose that there is a correlation.
