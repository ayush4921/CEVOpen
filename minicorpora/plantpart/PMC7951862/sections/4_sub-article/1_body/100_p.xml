<p>Au: Thank you for your concern. Only one heifer did not meet the Brix criteria, so she was taken out of the trial. Since we were evaluating animalâ€™s performance as well, immune function and health, it was vital that all animals had had a proper colostrum management. Therefore, the results obtained would not be influenced by that variable.</p>
