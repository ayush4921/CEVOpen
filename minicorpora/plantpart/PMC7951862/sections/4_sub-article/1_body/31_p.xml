<p>Au: Thank you for your contribution. Initially, we enrolled 15 animals in each treatment, with a total of 30 animals. However, one heifer form BEO treatment was not growing and had struggled with innumerous wealth problems. She was then euthanized, and it was discovered that she had a malformation of her intestinal tract. Because of that matter, she was taken out of the study. A new heifer was not enrolled in her place since the trial was already going on, and the animals were at least 30 days old. Enrolling a new animal after that long could change animal behave and performance due to contact with older animals. We also started the trial in March, which is fall in Brazil. If we decided to enroll a new animal, she would be born in winter. For those reasons, we decided then to have an unbalanced design. (L44, 128, 152-154, 302-304).</p>
