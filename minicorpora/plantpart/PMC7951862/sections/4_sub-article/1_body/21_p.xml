<p>Reviewer #1: Overall, the topic is relevant, and the objective stood to contribute to the exploration of bioactive ingredients as an alternative to antimicrobials. However, the presentation of the results and discussion lacked substance and did not accurately convey outcome or inferences for future use. Erring on benefit of the doubt with respect to translation difficulties; please extensively review for spelling, grammar and context. It was especially hard to follow logic and connection between referenced work and the results observed in the paper during the discussion. The authors have done good research but significant and major English editing and organization is needed. I have made some recommendations for edits but do not consider it an exhaustive list of what could be changed.</p>
