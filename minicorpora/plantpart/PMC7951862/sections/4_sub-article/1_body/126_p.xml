<p>Au: Thank you for your concern. We chose to measure the BW every 3 days so that way we would have a more accurate measurement of the weight gain and over diseases impact over it. The measurement was calculated using the day of the calf birth and adding 3 more days after every weight. For that reason, there was not a specific day to weight the calves. That would vary according to its day of birth (L 199).</p>
