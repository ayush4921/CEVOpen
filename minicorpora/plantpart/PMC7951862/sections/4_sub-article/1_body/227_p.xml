<p>Au: Thank you for your concern. We apologize for the misunderstanding. We reformulate the sentence to make clear the statement. What we suggest is that the heifers from BEO group could have a higher intake of starter in the morning when it was available, and that could lower the ruminal pH. Since we would evaluate intake just after 24 hours, we did not know how that intake was distributed throughout the day. So, it was evaluated the amount of intake and not intake behavior. For intake behavior, we mean when and how much at a time the heifer would eat (L418 â€“ 423).</p>
