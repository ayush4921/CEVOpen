<p>Au: Thank you for your concern. We wanted to give a good quality starter and a starter used by farmers. Monensin is an important and efficient growth promoter antibiotic used to prevent coccidiosis and increase performance. Therefore, most of the starters used in Brazil today contain this additive. Since both treatments received the starter containing monesin, and there were no differences for starter intake, we think that this did not impact our results. It shows that there was no antagonism between both additives. It must be highlight also that since monsein was provided at the start, it would go to the rumen. The essential oils blend was provided in the milk replacer so that it would go to the intestines. Thus, the target for the action of both additives would be different. We have cited ionophores in the intro since it is expected that the essential oils present similar results. However, we think more studies must evaluate the comparison between essential oils and other additives, as well as the evaluation of interactions of the combined use of both molecules (L170-177).</p>
