<p>The entire paragraph (lines 78-88) has the potential to be a slippery slope discussion regarding antibiotics so be careful with what you choose to include and how you make relation to natural alternatives. I think it could be framed in a much different context to discuss examples like the Veterinary Feed Directive in the US or limits on antibiotics as growth promoters are being phased out if not already illegal.</p>
