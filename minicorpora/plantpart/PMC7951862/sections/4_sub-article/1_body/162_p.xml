<p>Au: Thank you for your contribution. Gyr x Holstein is a typical cross dairy breed in Brazil. However, although the animals can have a similar genetic composition is still a very new breed with some variation among animals. For that reason, to have a more precise evaluation, we decided to block the genetic composition (L310).</p>
