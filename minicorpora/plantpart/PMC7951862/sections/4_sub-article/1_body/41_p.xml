<p>Au: Thank you for your contribution. We choose to put the commercial name of the used product since some papers do essential oil extract and can have different results. We do have which extracts plants compose the product. However, we think if we put which product we used, it can give more information to the reader. However, also added the plant extracts that component to the abstract: “composed by plant extracts derived from anise, cinnamon, garlic, rosemary and thyme” (L33-34).</p>
