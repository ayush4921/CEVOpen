<p>Au: Thank you for your concern. We added the timing of diarrhea occurrence. Farms usually use antibiotics to treat diarrhea, even if they do not know the cause. The primary motivation for the use of essential oils is to decrease disease morbidity and the use of antibiotics. Both disease, and antibiotics, can cause disorders on the gut microbiota and, consequently, to the animal itself. (L 327-328, and 332)</p>
